The Seattle Fire Department operates Seattle Medic One. The program is funded by the city's general fund and has a different administrative structure than the five other Medic One programs.<ref>EMS Division 2002, 2002 Strategic Plan Update pg. 53</ref> The five other Medic One programs with the exception of King County Medic One are operated by fire departments under a formal contract with the EMS Division of [[Public Health - Seattle & King County]].<ref>EMS Division 2002, 2002 Strategic Plan Update pg. 24</ref> King County Medic One is directly operated by the EMS Division.\n\nThe modern EMS system in King County began operation in 1970 with 15 paramedics staffing one [[paramedic]] unit in Seattle. In 2009, there were 255 paramedics<ref name=\"number of paramedics\">[http://depts.washington.edu/survive/local-action.php The local action plan to improve community cardiac arrest survival], section 7</ref> from six paramedic programs staffing 26 paramedic units.<ref name=\"seattle fire personnel apparatus profile\">Seattle Fire Department 2008, pg. 2</ref><ref name=\"ems division 2009 pg 75\">EMS Division 2009, pg. 75</ref>\n\nThe system is a dynamic layered response system. An EMS response to an emergency begins with a telephone call to [[9-1-1]]. Calls are transferred from a primary call taker to [[emergency medical dispatcher|emergency medical call taker]] who gathers information from the caller, gives instructions to the caller, and determines what types of emergency personnel to send. For very serious and life-threatening emergencies [[firefighter]]s trained in [[basic life support]] and paramedics trained in [[advanced life support]] respond simultaneously. Paramedics transport patients in critical condition. For less severe emergencies only firefighters will be dispatched. Basic life support personnel from either a fire department or private ambulance company transport non-critical patients. <!--In 2008 paramedics were dispatched 29% of the time. The system is designed to have a few paramedics performing many advanced skills.-->\n\n==History==\n[[File:Seattle - Medic One aid unit, circa 1970 (28869150576).jpg|thumb|Patient being loaded into a Seattle Medic One ambulance circa 1970]]\n[[Image:seattle fire department medic 80.jpg|thumb|Seattle Paramedic Unit]]\n[[Image:King County Medic 4.jpg|thumb|King County Paramedic Unit]]\n\nIn 1968, motivated by the work of [[Frank Pantridge]], cardiologist [[Leonard Cobb]] proposed to the chief of the [[Seattle Fire Department]], [[Gordon Vickery]], training firefighters to treat cardiac arrest. The department was attractive to Cobb because it already provided first aid and tracked its performance electronically.<ref>Cardiac Arrest: The Science and Practice of Resuscitation Medicine, pg. 20</ref>\n\nIn 1969, they trained fifteen firefighters and used a grant from the Washington/Alaska Regional Medical Program to convert a large [[Recreational vehicle|motor home]] into a Mobile Coronary Care Unit nicknamed \"Moby Pig\", which would respond to calls with both the firefighter paramedics and a physician on board.\n\nThe first Medic One call was on March 7, 1970. During the program's first year, 31 lives were saved.<ref name =\"USA Today\">{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Robert |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/ems-day1-seattle.htm |title=Seattle: Firefighters, medics unite to save lives |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2005-05-20 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>  The following year the program was changed, replacing the on-board doctors with fire department paramedics given advanced special training and remote access to the doctors.\n\nIn 1974, the TV news-magazine ''[[60 Minutes]]'' profiled the success of Medic One, lauding the high standards of training and education provided by the Seattle training program.  Correspondent [[Morley Safer]] declared, \"If you have to have a heart attack, have it in Seattle\". The phrase is still used frequently in conjunction with Medic One, due to its continued success which is reflected in the area's high survival rate for heart attacks and their comprehensive CPR training program.<ref name=\"DYK\">{{cite news |url=http://www.mediconefoundation.org/facts/did-you-know.htm |title=Medic One Facts \u2013 Did You Know|publisher=Medic One Foundation |date= |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref><ref name=\"KC\"/>\n\nThat same year Medic One incorporated as a privately held, [[non-profit organization]] and established the Medic One Foundation, which works on behalf of both fund raising and the expansion of the program. The program is financed by local property tax levies, which are voted on by the public every six years, along with private and corporate donations.<ref name=\"KC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/ems/MedicOne.aspx|title=King County Medic One|publisher=Public Health Seattle & King County|date=|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>\n\nMedic One had saved 655 patients from cardiac arrest by 1976 and this success was gaining national and international attention.<ref name=\"UW\">{{cite news|url=http://www.washington.edu/research/pathbreakers/1970a.html|title=1970 Medic One |publisher=University of Washington Department of Research|date=1996-09-01|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>  Medic One service was expanded into the rest of King County in 1976,<ref>Belew, Ellie 2004, pg. 78 - 79 [http://www.iaff2595.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_page.cfm&page=History20of20Local202595 History of Local 2595]</ref> and in conjunction with the Medic One Foundation, other counties in Washington State began paramedic programs to serve their communities.\n\nIn 1979, Cobb and UW professor Mickey Eisenberg began training fire department [[emergency medical technician - Basic]]s (EMT-Bs) to perform the administration of [[defibrillation]] for patients in cardiac arrest since the EMTs were usually at the patient's side several minutes before the paramedics.  Eisenberg began training 9-1-1 dispatchers to provide instructions to lay-persons on how to perform CPR in 1982.  With the introduction of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in 1984, EMTs were able to defibrillate patients in cardiac arrest even more quickly.<ref name=\"UW\"/>\n\n==Programs==\nThere are five paramedic programs in the Medic One system.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n!

Emergency Medical Dispatchers are trained to rapidly triage the call to dispatch the appropriate level of assistance, while providing pre-arrival instruction of CPR. Firefighters, with EMT training, respond first to deliver immediate Basic Life Support (BLS), pending the arrival of the paramedics. Specially trained paramedics arrive within minutes to provide Advanced Life Support (ALS) and, if needed, can provide transportation to the nearest appropriate Medical Center.<ref name=\"Strategic Plan\">{{cite news|url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/ems/~/media/health/publichealth/documents/ems/Strategic_Plan_2008_2013.ashx |title=Medic One/Emergency Medical Services \u2013 2008-2013 Strategic Plan |publisher=Public Health Seattle & King County|date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>\n\nThe system is successful due to the blended cooperation between the fire department and paramedic/ambulance services, as well as, a strict policy of meticulous measurement of system performance and cardiac arrest survival information. Strong leadership and regional programs promote uniformity in medical care and response, regardless of jurisdiction.<ref name =\"USA Today\"/>\n\nAnother critical element to the Medic One program is the comprehensive training program for the paramedics, one of the most stringent anywhere, making their paramedics some of the most thoroughly trained in the world. Only paramedics with at least three years of prior firefighter or EMT experience may enter the program. Medic One paramedics receive 2,000 hours of instruction, using both \u201cbook\u201d studies and hands on field and clinical application through both the University of Washington and Harborview Medical Center. The national standard for paramedic training is just 1,100 hours. Medic One paramedics will have more than 700 patient contacts during their training, which is three times the national standard. Upon completion of training Medic One paramedics are considered to be an extension of the ER doctors and may perform advanced medical care, open airways and administer a variety of medications.<ref name=\"DYK\"/>\n\nThe final component is an emphasis on community based CPR training, called Medic Two. The Seattle/[[King County, Washington|King County]] area has the highest per capita number of citizens that are trained in the administration of CPR techniques, approximately 50% of its residents.<ref name=\"QPR\">{{cite news|url=http://www.qprinstitute.com/Whatis.htm|title=In One Hour You Can Become a Gatekeeper |publisher=QPR Institute|year=1999|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>\n\n===Leadership===\n\nMedic One is operated as a partnership between physicians and administrators. Medical directors review patient care by paramedics and can make recommendations including decertification and termination. Administrators act upon the recommendations of the medical director.<ref>Eisenberg 2009, pg. 123</ref>\n\n===Response===\n\nThe major components of Medic One's response system are universal access, dispatcher triage, basic life support services, advanced life support services, and transport to hospitals.<ref name=\"EMS Division 2009 pg 9\"/>\n\nA medical [[9-1-1]] call is handled by one of the following communication centers [[Seattle Fire Department Alarm Center]], [[Valley Communications Center]], [[North East King County Regional Public Safety Communication Agency]], or [[Port of Seattle Police Department Communications Center]].\n\nMedic One dispatchers use [[criteria based dispatch]] guidelines to send the most appropriate care providers. The three response levels are basic with advanced life support units, emergency BLS only, and non-emergency BLS only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/ems/community/~/media/health/publichealth/documents/ems/cbdarticle.ashx|title=Criteria Based Dispatch: Improving Emergency Medical Dispatching|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe first tier is [[basic life support]] provided by cross-trained firefighter [[emergency medical technician - basic]]s.\n\nThe second tier is [[advanced life support]].\n\nBasic life support transports for 9-1-1 calls are provided by either a fire department or one of the private ambulance companies [[American Medical Response]] and [[Tri-Med Ambulance]]. Advanced life support transports for 9-1-1 calls are provided by paramedics.\n\n===Education===\n\n[[Image:Uw paramedic training program hours.png|thumb|Break down of training<ref>[http://www.hecb.wa.gov/autheval/dpr/documents/UWBofParamedWEB.pdf]{{dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref>]]\n\nAll paramedics in King County are graduates of the [[University of Washington Paramedic Training Program]] regardless of previous training. The training is 1,866 total hours consisting of 380 lecture hours, 120 lab hours, 466 clinical hours in the [[operating room]] and [[emergency department]] at [[Harborview Medical Center]] and [[critical care unit]] and [[labor and delivery]] at [[Seattle Children's|Seattle Children's Hospital]], and 900 field internship hours with [[Seattle Medic One]].<ref>Seattle Channel, minute 33:18</ref> Students see an average of 700 patient contacts.\n\n===Improvement===\n\nThe paramedic medical director for the one of six Medic One programs that provided care reviews every resuscitation, intubation, and central-line placement attempt. That director provides both positive and negative feedback. For probationary paramedics a more rigorous review is conducted.<ref name=\"Eisenberg 2009, pg. 129\"/>\n\n==Funding==\n\nMedic One paramedic programs are funded by a property tax levy. Basic life support services receive partial funding from the levy. The levy passed in 1979, 1985, 1991, 1998, 2001, and 2008.<ref>EMS Division 2008, Strategic Plan pg. 11</ref> The levy did not pass in 1997.<ref>EMS Division 2008, Strategic Plan pg. 12</ref>\n\nThe Medic One Foundation is a nonprofit charitable foundation supporting paramedic training, research, medical oversight and quality review, and the purchasing of emergency medical equipment.<ref>Medic One Foundation, [http://www.mediconefoundation.org/docs/2006-07_Financial_Highlights.pdf 2006-07 Financial Highlights]</ref>\n\n==Performance==\n\n===Cardiac arrest===\n\nA change in the protocol of emergency response personnel is also credited as contributing to the high survival rate in the region. Guidelines set by the American Heart Association in 2000, recommend repeated shocks from a defibrillator and to check for a pulse prior to starting CPR. Medic One guidelines, established in 2005, are to provide a single shock from a defibrillator followed immediately by two minutes of CPR, beginning with chest compressions. This has dropped the average time between first shock to starting CPR from twenty-eight seconds to seven seconds, resulting in a near 50% increase in the previous rate of survival. For every one hundred cardiac arrest calls, now an additional thirteen patients will live.<ref name=\"SPI\">{{cite news |last=Black |first=Cherie |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/health/295585_cpr12.html   |title=SCounty boosts cardiac survival rate - Reason may be a new resuscitation method used by emergency crews |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Sorted highest to lowest cardiac arrest survival rates jama 2008.png|right|thumb|Survival rates for ten communities from May 1, 2006 to April 30, 2007]]\n\n[[Image:King county vf cardiac arrest survival rates chart.png|right|thumb|Survival rates from 2001 through 2008 for bystander witnessed cardiac arrest due to heart disease with an initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or [[ventricular tachycardia]]<ref name=\"ems division 2009 pg 70\">EMS Division 2009, pg. 70</ref><ref name=\"EMS Division 2007, pg. 61\">EMS Division 2007, pg. 61</ref><ref name=\"EMS Division 2008, pg. 64\">EMS Division 2008, pg. 64</ref>]]\n\n[[Image:Public access defibrillators in King County.png|right|thumb|Growth of registered public access defibrillators in King County from 1999 to 2006<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Rea TD, Olsufka M, Bemis B, etal |title=A population-based investigation of public access defibrillation: role of emergency medical services care |journal=Resuscitation |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=163\u20137 |date=February 2010 |pmid=19962225 |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2009.10.025 |url=}}</ref>]]\n\nIn King County outcomes of attempted out-of-hospital resuscitations are recorded, following the [[Utstein Style|Utstein uniform reporting guidelines]], in a cardiac arrest registry.

The Seattle Fire Department operates Seattle Medic One. The program is funded by the city's general fund and has a different administrative structure than the five other Medic One programs.<ref>EMS Division 2002, 2002 Strategic Plan Update pg. 53</ref> The five other Medic One programs with the exception of King County Medic One are operated by fire departments under a formal contract with the EMS Division of [[Public Health - Seattle & King County]].<ref>EMS Division 2002, 2002 Strategic Plan Update pg. 24</ref> King County Medic One is directly operated by the EMS Division.\n\nThe modern EMS system in King County began operation in 1970 with 15 paramedics staffing one [[paramedic]] unit in Seattle. In 2009, there were 255 paramedics<ref name=\"number of paramedics\">[http://depts.washington.edu/survive/local-action.php The local action plan to improve community cardiac arrest survival], section 7</ref> from six paramedic programs staffing 26 paramedic units.<ref name=\"seattle fire personnel apparatus profile\">Seattle Fire Department 2008, pg. 2</ref><ref name=\"ems division 2009 pg 75\">EMS Division 2009, pg. 75</ref>\n\nThe system is a dynamic layered response system. An EMS response to an emergency begins with a telephone call to [[9-1-1]]. Calls are transferred from a primary call taker to [[emergency medical dispatcher|emergency medical call taker]] who gathers information from the caller, gives instructions to the caller, and determines what types of emergency personnel to send. For very serious and life-threatening emergencies [[firefighter]]s trained in [[basic life support]] and paramedics trained in [[advanced life support]] respond simultaneously. Paramedics transport patients in critical condition. For less severe emergencies only firefighters will be dispatched. Basic life support personnel from either a fire department or private ambulance company transport non-critical patients. <!--In 2008 paramedics were dispatched 29% of the time. The system is designed to have a few paramedics performing many advanced skills.-->\n\n==History==\n[[File:Seattle - Medic One aid unit, circa 1970 (28869150576).jpg|thumb|Patient being loaded into a Seattle Medic One ambulance circa 1970]]\n[[Image:seattle fire department medic 80.jpg|thumb|Seattle Paramedic Unit]]\n[[Image:King County Medic 4.jpg|thumb|King County Paramedic Unit]]\n\nIn 1968, motivated by the work of [[Frank Pantridge]], cardiologist [[Leonard Cobb]] proposed to the chief of the [[Seattle Fire Department]], [[Gordon Vickery]], training firefighters to treat cardiac arrest. The department was attractive to Cobb because it already provided first aid and tracked its performance electronically.<ref>Cardiac Arrest: The Science and Practice of Resuscitation Medicine, pg. 20</ref>\n\nIn 1969, they trained fifteen firefighters and used a grant from the Washington/Alaska Regional Medical Program to convert a large [[Recreational vehicle|motor home]] into a Mobile Coronary Care Unit nicknamed \"Moby Pig\", which would respond to calls with both the firefighter paramedics and a physician on board.\n\nThe first Medic One call was on March 7, 1970. During the program's first year, 31 lives were saved.<ref name =\"USA Today\">{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Robert |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/ems-day1-seattle.htm |title=Seattle: Firefighters, medics unite to save lives |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=2005-05-20 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>  The following year the program was changed, replacing the on-board doctors with fire department paramedics given advanced special training and remote access to the doctors.\n\nIn 1974, the TV news-magazine ''[[60 Minutes]]'' profiled the success of Medic One, lauding the high standards of training and education provided by the Seattle training program.  Correspondent [[Morley Safer]] declared, \"If you have to have a heart attack, have it in Seattle\". The phrase is still used frequently in conjunction with Medic One, due to its continued success which is reflected in the area's high survival rate for heart attacks and their comprehensive CPR training program.<ref name=\"DYK\">{{cite news |url=http://www.mediconefoundation.org/facts/did-you-know.htm |title=Medic One Facts \u2013 Did You Know|publisher=Medic One Foundation |date= |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref><ref name=\"KC\"/>\n\nThat same year Medic One incorporated as a privately held, [[non-profit organization]] and established the Medic One Foundation, which works on behalf of both fund raising and the expansion of the program. The program is financed by local property tax levies, which are voted on by the public every six years, along with private and corporate donations.<ref name=\"KC\">{{cite news|url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/ems/MedicOne.aspx|title=King County Medic One|publisher=Public Health Seattle & King County|date=|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>\n\nMedic One had saved 655 patients from cardiac arrest by 1976 and this success was gaining national and international attention.<ref name=\"UW\">{{cite news|url=http://www.washington.edu/research/pathbreakers/1970a.html|title=1970 Medic One |publisher=University of Washington Department of Research|date=1996-09-01|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>  Medic One service was expanded into the rest of King County in 1976,<ref>Belew, Ellie 2004, pg. 78 - 79 [http://www.iaff2595.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_page.cfm&page=History20of20Local202595 History of Local 2595]</ref> and in conjunction with the Medic One Foundation, other counties in Washington State began paramedic programs to serve their communities.\n\nIn 1979, Cobb and UW professor Mickey Eisenberg began training fire department [[emergency medical technician - Basic]]s (EMT-Bs) to perform the administration of [[defibrillation]] for patients in cardiac arrest since the EMTs were usually at the patient's side several minutes before the paramedics.  Eisenberg began training 9-1-1 dispatchers to provide instructions to lay-persons on how to perform CPR in 1982.  With the introduction of automatic external defibrillators (AEDs) in 1984, EMTs were able to defibrillate patients in cardiac arrest even more quickly.<ref name=\"UW\"/>\n\n==Programs==\nThere are five paramedic programs in the Medic One system.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\" style=\"font-size:85%;\"\n|-\n!

Emergency Medical Dispatchers are trained to rapidly triage the call to dispatch the appropriate level of assistance, while providing pre-arrival instruction of CPR. Firefighters, with EMT training, respond first to deliver immediate Basic Life Support (BLS), pending the arrival of the paramedics. Specially trained paramedics arrive within minutes to provide Advanced Life Support (ALS) and, if needed, can provide transportation to the nearest appropriate Medical Center.<ref name=\"Strategic Plan\">{{cite news|url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/ems/~/media/health/publichealth/documents/ems/Strategic_Plan_2008_2013.ashx |title=Medic One/Emergency Medical Services \u2013 2008-2013 Strategic Plan |publisher=Public Health Seattle & King County|date=2007-01-01|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>\n\nThe system is successful due to the blended cooperation between the fire department and paramedic/ambulance services, as well as, a strict policy of meticulous measurement of system performance and cardiac arrest survival information. Strong leadership and regional programs promote uniformity in medical care and response, regardless of jurisdiction.<ref name =\"USA Today\"/>\n\nAnother critical element to the Medic One program is the comprehensive training program for the paramedics, one of the most stringent anywhere, making their paramedics some of the most thoroughly trained in the world. Only paramedics with at least three years of prior firefighter or EMT experience may enter the program. Medic One paramedics receive 2,000 hours of instruction, using both \u201cbook\u201d studies and hands on field and clinical application through both the University of Washington and Harborview Medical Center. The national standard for paramedic training is just 1,100 hours. Medic One paramedics will have more than 700 patient contacts during their training, which is three times the national standard. Upon completion of training Medic One paramedics are considered to be an extension of the ER doctors and may perform advanced medical care, open airways and administer a variety of medications.<ref name=\"DYK\"/>\n\nThe final component is an emphasis on community based CPR training, called Medic Two. The Seattle/[[King County, Washington|King County]] area has the highest per capita number of citizens that are trained in the administration of CPR techniques, approximately 50% of its residents.<ref name=\"QPR\">{{cite news|url=http://www.qprinstitute.com/Whatis.htm|title=In One Hour You Can Become a Gatekeeper |publisher=QPR Institute|year=1999|accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>\n\n===Leadership===\n\nMedic One is operated as a partnership between physicians and administrators. Medical directors review patient care by paramedics and can make recommendations including decertification and termination. Administrators act upon the recommendations of the medical director.<ref>Eisenberg 2009, pg. 123</ref>\n\n===Response===\n\nThe major components of Medic One's response system are universal access, dispatcher triage, basic life support services, advanced life support services, and transport to hospitals.<ref name=\"EMS Division 2009 pg 9\"/>\n\nA medical [[9-1-1]] call is handled by one of the following communication centers [[Seattle Fire Department Alarm Center]], [[Valley Communications Center]], [[North East King County Regional Public Safety Communication Agency]], or [[Port of Seattle Police Department Communications Center]].\n\nMedic One dispatchers use [[criteria based dispatch]] guidelines to send the most appropriate care providers. The three response levels are basic with advanced life support units, emergency BLS only, and non-emergency BLS only.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kingcounty.gov/healthservices/health/ems/community/~/media/health/publichealth/documents/ems/cbdarticle.ashx|title=Criteria Based Dispatch: Improving Emergency Medical Dispatching|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe first tier is [[basic life support]] provided by cross-trained firefighter [[emergency medical technician - basic]]s.\n\nThe second tier is [[advanced life support]].\n\nBasic life support transports for 9-1-1 calls are provided by either a fire department or one of the private ambulance companies [[American Medical Response]] and [[Tri-Med Ambulance]]. Advanced life support transports for 9-1-1 calls are provided by paramedics.\n\n===Education===\n\n[[Image:Uw paramedic training program hours.png|thumb|Break down of training<ref>[http://www.hecb.wa.gov/autheval/dpr/documents/UWBofParamedWEB.pdf]{{dead link|date=June 2019}}</ref>]]\n\nAll paramedics in King County are graduates of the [[University of Washington Paramedic Training Program]] regardless of previous training. The training is 1,866 total hours consisting of 380 lecture hours, 120 lab hours, 466 clinical hours in the [[operating room]] and [[emergency department]] at [[Harborview Medical Center]] and [[critical care unit]] and [[labor and delivery]] at [[Seattle Children's|Seattle Children's Hospital]], and 900 field internship hours with [[Seattle Medic One]].<ref>Seattle Channel, minute 33:18</ref> Students see an average of 700 patient contacts.\n\n===Improvement===\n\nThe paramedic medical director for the one of six Medic One programs that provided care reviews every resuscitation, intubation, and central-line placement attempt. That director provides both positive and negative feedback. For probationary paramedics a more rigorous review is conducted.<ref name=\"Eisenberg 2009, pg. 129\"/>\n\n==Funding==\n\nMedic One paramedic programs are funded by a property tax levy. Basic life support services receive partial funding from the levy. The levy passed in 1979, 1985, 1991, 1998, 2001, and 2008.<ref>EMS Division 2008, Strategic Plan pg. 11</ref> The levy did not pass in 1997.<ref>EMS Division 2008, Strategic Plan pg. 12</ref>\n\nThe Medic One Foundation is a nonprofit charitable foundation supporting paramedic training, research, medical oversight and quality review, and the purchasing of emergency medical equipment.<ref>Medic One Foundation, [http://www.mediconefoundation.org/docs/2006-07_Financial_Highlights.pdf 2006-07 Financial Highlights]</ref>\n\n==Performance==\n\n===Cardiac arrest===\n\nA change in the protocol of emergency response personnel is also credited as contributing to the high survival rate in the region. Guidelines set by the American Heart Association in 2000, recommend repeated shocks from a defibrillator and to check for a pulse prior to starting CPR. Medic One guidelines, established in 2005, are to provide a single shock from a defibrillator followed immediately by two minutes of CPR, beginning with chest compressions. This has dropped the average time between first shock to starting CPR from twenty-eight seconds to seven seconds, resulting in a near 50% increase in the previous rate of survival. For every one hundred cardiac arrest calls, now an additional thirteen patients will live.<ref name=\"SPI\">{{cite news |last=Black |first=Cherie |url=http://www.seattlepi.com/health/295585_cpr12.html   |title=SCounty boosts cardiac survival rate - Reason may be a new resuscitation method used by emergency crews |publisher=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]] |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Sorted highest to lowest cardiac arrest survival rates jama 2008.png|right|thumb|Survival rates for ten communities from May 1, 2006 to April 30, 2007]]\n\n[[Image:King county vf cardiac arrest survival rates chart.png|right|thumb|Survival rates from 2001 through 2008 for bystander witnessed cardiac arrest due to heart disease with an initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation or [[ventricular tachycardia]]<ref name=\"ems division 2009 pg 70\">EMS Division 2009, pg. 70</ref><ref name=\"EMS Division 2007, pg. 61\">EMS Division 2007, pg. 61</ref><ref name=\"EMS Division 2008, pg. 64\">EMS Division 2008, pg. 64</ref>]]\n\n[[Image:Public access defibrillators in King County.png|right|thumb|Growth of registered public access defibrillators in King County from 1999 to 2006<ref>{{cite journal  |vauthors=Rea TD, Olsufka M, Bemis B, etal |title=A population-based investigation of public access defibrillation: role of emergency medical services care |journal=Resuscitation |volume=81 |issue=2 |pages=163\u20137 |date=February 2010 |pmid=19962225 |doi=10.1016/j.resuscitation.2009.10.025 |url=}}</ref>]]\n\nIn King County outcomes of attempted out-of-hospital resuscitations are recorded, following the [[Utstein Style|Utstein uniform reporting guidelines]], in a cardiac arrest registry.

There are two versions of it: the black canoe and the jade canoe. The black canoe features on [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill|Canadian $20 bill]]s<ref>http://www.billreidfoundation.org/banknote/spirit.htm</ref> issued between 2004 and 2012.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:RK 0908 9604 Spirit of Haida Gwaii the Jade Canoe.jpg|thumb|left|''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Jade Canoe'', inside Vancouver International Airport]]\nThe sculpture was originally created in 1986 as a {{frac|1|6}}-scale clay model, enlarged in 1988, to full-size clay. In 1991, the model was cast in bronze.  This first bronze casting was entitled '''''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Black Canoe''''' and is now displayed outside the [[Canadian Embassy in Washington|Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C.]]  The second bronze casting, entitled '''''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Jade Canoe''''', was first displayed at the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in 1994. Finally, in 1996, the ''Jade Canoe'' (as it is generally called) was moved to the International Terminal at [[Vancouver International Airport]].\n\nThe original  plaster pattern for the sculpture is on display in the main hall of the Canadian Museum of History.<ref>http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/grand/gh04eng.shtml</ref>\n[[File:Spirit of Haida Gwaii, plaster original.jpg|thumb|Full-sized model in [[Canadian Museum of History]]]]\n\nOn 30 April 1996 Canada Post issued ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, 1986\u20131991, Bill Reid'' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on a sculpture ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' (1991) by William Ronald Reid in the Canadian Embassy, Washington, United States. The 90\u00a2 stamps are perforated 12.5&nbsp;mm \u00d7 13&nbsp;mm and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130101051500/http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(art.TITP.)+Or+(art.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&l=20&d=STMP&p=1&u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&r=12&f=G&Sect1=STMP Canada Post stamp]</ref>\n\nAn image of the sculpture is featured prominently on the reverse of the 2004 edition of the [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill]]. These bills are no longer issued; a new design entered use in 2012.\n\n==Sculpture==\n[[File:Spirit of Haida Gwaii, The Jade Canoe, port side.jpg|thumb|Port side of the ''Jade Canoe'']]\n''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' is intended to represent the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] heritage of [[Haida Gwaii]], formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands.  In green-coloured bronze on the Vancouver version and black-coloured on the Washington version, it shows a traditional Haida cedar [[dugout canoe]] which totals six metres in length. The canoe carries the following passengers:  [[Raven]], the traditional [[trickster]] of [[Haida mythology]], holding the steering oar; [[Mouse]] Woman, crouched under Raven's tail; [[Grizzly Bear]], sitting at the bow and staring toward Raven; Bear Mother, Grizzly's human wife; their cubs, Good Bear (ears pointed forward) and Bad Bear (ears pointed back); [[Beaver]], Raven's uncle; [[Squaliformes|Dogfish]] Woman; [[Eagle]]; [[Frog]]; [[Wolf]], claws imbedded in Beaver's back and teeth in Eagle's wing; a small human paddler in Haida garb known as the Ancient Reluctant Conscript; and, at the sculpture's focal point, the human [[Shaman]] (or {{lang|hai|Kilstlaai}} in [[Haida language|Haida]]), who wears the Haida cloak and woven spruce root hat and holds a tall staff carved with images of Seabear, Raven, and [[Killer Whale]].\nConsistent with Haida tradition, the significance of the passengers is highly symbolic.  The variety and interdependence of the canoe's occupants represents the natural environment on which the ancient Haida relied for their very survival: the passengers are diverse, and not always in harmony, yet they must depend on one another to live.

There are two versions of it: the black canoe and the jade canoe. The black canoe features on [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill|Canadian $20 bill]]s<ref>http://www.billreidfoundation.org/banknote/spirit.htm</ref> issued between 2004 and 2012.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:RK 0908 9604 Spirit of Haida Gwaii the Jade Canoe.jpg|thumb|left|''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Jade Canoe'', inside Vancouver International Airport]]\nThe sculpture was originally created in 1986 as a {{frac|1|6}}-scale clay model, enlarged in 1988, to full-size clay. In 1991, the model was cast in bronze.  This first bronze casting was entitled '''''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Black Canoe''''' and is now displayed outside the [[Canadian Embassy in Washington|Canadian Embassy in Washington, D.C.]]  The second bronze casting, entitled '''''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, the Jade Canoe''''', was first displayed at the [[Canadian Museum of History]] in 1994. Finally, in 1996, the ''Jade Canoe'' (as it is generally called) was moved to the International Terminal at [[Vancouver International Airport]].\n\nThe original  plaster pattern for the sculpture is on display in the main hall of the Canadian Museum of History.<ref>http://www.historymuseum.ca/cmc/exhibitions/aborig/grand/gh04eng.shtml</ref>\n[[File:Spirit of Haida Gwaii, plaster original.jpg|thumb|Full-sized model in [[Canadian Museum of History]]]]\n\nOn 30 April 1996 Canada Post issued ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii, 1986\u20131991, Bill Reid'' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on a sculpture ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' (1991) by William Ronald Reid in the Canadian Embassy, Washington, United States. The 90\u00a2 stamps are perforated 12.5&nbsp;mm \u00d7 13&nbsp;mm and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.<ref>[https://archive.is/20130101051500/http://data4.collectionscanada.gc.ca/netacgi/nph-brs?s1=(art.TITP.)+Or+(art.TITI.+And+null.B742.)&l=20&d=STMP&p=1&u=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/archivianet/02011702_e.html&r=12&f=G&Sect1=STMP Canada Post stamp]</ref>\n\nAn image of the sculpture is featured prominently on the reverse of the 2004 edition of the [[Canadian twenty-dollar bill]]. These bills are no longer issued; a new design entered use in 2012.\n\n==Sculpture==\n[[File:Spirit of Haida Gwaii, The Jade Canoe, port side.jpg|thumb|Port side of the ''Jade Canoe'']]\n''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' is intended to represent the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal]] heritage of [[Haida Gwaii]], formerly called the Queen Charlotte Islands.  In green-coloured bronze on the Vancouver version and black-coloured on the Washington version, it shows a traditional Haida cedar [[dugout canoe]] which totals six metres in length. The canoe carries the following passengers:  [[Raven]], the traditional [[trickster]] of [[Haida mythology]], holding the steering oar; [[Mouse]] Woman, crouched under Raven's tail; [[Grizzly Bear]], sitting at the bow and staring toward Raven; Bear Mother, Grizzly's human wife; their cubs, Good Bear (ears pointed forward) and Bad Bear (ears pointed back); [[Beaver]], Raven's uncle; [[Squaliformes|Dogfish]] Woman; [[Eagle]]; [[Frog]]; [[Wolf]], claws imbedded in Beaver's back and teeth in Eagle's wing; a small human paddler in Haida garb known as the Ancient Reluctant Conscript; and, at the sculpture's focal point, the human [[Shaman]] (or {{lang|hai|Kilstlaai}} in [[Haida language|Haida]]), who wears the Haida cloak and woven spruce root hat and holds a tall staff carved with images of Seabear, Raven, and [[Killer Whale]].\nConsistent with Haida tradition, the significance of the passengers is highly symbolic.  The variety and interdependence of the canoe's occupants represents the natural environment on which the ancient Haida relied for their very survival: the passengers are diverse, and not always in harmony, yet they must depend on one another to live. The fact that the cunning trickster, Raven, holds the steering oar is likely symbolic of nature's unpredictability.\nThe sculpture is {{convert|6|m}} long, not quite {{convert|4|m}} from the base to the top of the Shaman's staff, and weighs nearly {{convert|5000|kg}}.<ref>http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/washington/offices-bureaux/haida.aspx?lang=eng</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.yvr.ca/en/about-yvr/art/the-heart-of-the-airport Vancouver International Airport: ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' page]\n*[http://www.canadainternational.gc.ca/washington/offices-bureaux/haida.aspx?lang=eng Foreign Affairs Canada: ''The Spirit of Haida Gwaii'' page]\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Spirit of Haida Gwaii}}\n[[Category:First Nations culture]]\n[[Category:Outdoor sculptures in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Bronze sculptures in Canada]]\n[[Category:1986 sculptures]]\n[[Category:Bronze sculptures in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Statues in Canada]]\n[[Category:Sculptures of mythology]]\n[[Category:Sculptures of women in Washington, D.C.]]\n[[Category:Vancouver International Airport]]\n", "name_user": "Ham II", "label": "safe", "comment": "+Template:Public art in Washington, D.C.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_Haida_Gwaii"}

It has since the mid-20th century generally been called the [[Hadrosaurinae]], a group of largely non-crested hadrosaurs related to the crested sub-family [[Lambeosaurinae]]. However, the name Hadrosaurinae is based on the genus ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' which was found in more recent studies to be more primitive than either lambeosaurines or other traditional \"hadrosaurines\", like ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' and ''[[Saurolophus]]''. As a result of this, the name Hadrosaurinae was dropped or restricted to ''Hadrosaurus'' alone, and the subfamily comprising the traditional \"hadrosaurines\" was renamed the Saurolophinae.<ref name=APM2013>{{cite journal |last=Prieto-M\u00e1rquez |first=A. |year=2013 |title=Skeletal morphology of ''Kritosaurus navajovius'' (Dinosauria:Hadrosauridae) from the Late Cretaceous of the North American south-west, with an evaluation of the phylogenetic systematics and biogeography of Kritosaurini |journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology |volume=in press |doi=10.1080/14772019.2013.770417 |pages=133\u2013175}}</ref> Recent phylogenetic work by Hai Xing indicates that ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' is placed within the monophyletic group containing all non-lambeosaurine hadrosaurids.<ref name=Zhanghenglong>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0098821| pmid = 24901454| title = A New Basal Hadrosauroid Dinosaur (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) with Transitional Features from the Late Cretaceous of Henan Province, China| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 6| pages = e98821| year = 2014| last1 = Xing | first1 = H. | last2 = Wang | first2 = D. | last3 = Han | first3 = F. | last4 = Sullivan | first4 = C. | last5 = Ma | first5 = Q. | last6 = He | first6 = Y. | last7 = Hone | first7 = D.

However, the use of the term Hadrosaurinae was questioned in a comprehensive study of hadrosaurid relationships by Albert Prieto-M\u00e1rquez in 2010. Prieto-M\u00e1rquez noted that, though the name Hadrosaurinae had been used for the clade of mostly crestless hadrosaurids by nearly all previous studies, its type species, ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'', has almost always been excluded from the clade that bears its name, in violation of the rules for naming animals set out by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]. Prieto-M\u00e1rquez (2010) defined Hadrosaurinae as only the lineage containing ''H. foulkii'', and used the name Saurolophinae instead for the traditional grouping.<ref name=\"Prieto_2010\">{{cite journal\n  | author =Prieto-M\u00e1rquez, A.\n  | title =Global phylogeny of Hadrosauridae (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) using parsimony and Bayesian methods\n  | journal =Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society\n  | volume =159\n  | issue =2\n  | pages =435\u2013502\n  | year =2010\n  | doi =10.1111/j.1096-3642.2009.00617.x\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[cladogram]] below follows Godefroit ''et al.''

[[hadrosaurid]] [[dinosaur]]s. It has since the mid-20th century generally been called the [[Hadrosaurinae]], a group of largely non-crested hadrosaurs related to the crested sub-family [[Lambeosaurinae]]. However, the name Hadrosaurinae is based on the genus ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' which was found in more recent studies to be more primitive than either lambeosaurines or other traditional \"hadrosaurines\", like ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'' and ''[[Saurolophus]]''. As a result of this, the name Hadrosaurinae was dropped or restricted to ''Hadrosaurus'' alone, and the subfamily comprising the traditional \"hadrosaurines\" was renamed the Saurolophinae.<ref name=APM2013>{{cite journal |last=Prieto-M\u00e1rquez |first=A. |year=2013 |title=Skeletal morphology of ''Kritosaurus navajovius'' (Dinosauria:Hadrosauridae) from the Late Cretaceous of the North American south-west, with an evaluation of the phylogenetic systematics and biogeography of Kritosaurini |journal=Journal of Systematic Palaeontology |volume=in press |doi=10.1080/14772019.2013.770417}}</ref> Recent phylogenetic work by Hai Xing indicates that ''[[Hadrosaurus]]'' is placed within the monophyletic group containing all non-lambeosaurine hadrosaurids.<ref name=Zhanghenglong>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0098821| pmid = 24901454| title = A New Basal Hadrosauroid Dinosaur (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) with Transitional Features from the Late Cretaceous of Henan Province, China| journal = PLoS ONE| volume = 9| issue = 6| pages = e98821| year = 2014| last1 = Xing | first1 = H. | last2 = Wang | first2 = D. | last3 = Han | first3 = F. | last4 = Sullivan | first4 = C. | last5 = Ma | first5 = Q. | last6 = He | first6 = Y. | last7 = Hone | first7 = D.

However, the use of the term Hadrosaurinae was questioned in a comprehensive study of hadrosaurid relationships by Albert Prieto-M\u00e1rquez in 2010. Prieto-M\u00e1rquez noted that, though the name Hadrosaurinae had been used for the clade of mostly crestless hadrosaurids by nearly all previous studies, its type species, ''Hadrosaurus foulkii'', has almost always been excluded from the clade that bears its name, in violation of the rules for naming animals set out by the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature|ICZN]]. Prieto-M\u00e1rquez (2010) defined Hadrosaurinae as only the lineage containing ''H. foulkii'', and used the name Saurolophinae instead for the traditional grouping.<ref name=\"Prieto_2010\">{{cite journal\n  | author =Prieto-M\u00e1rquez, A.\n  | title =Global phylogeny of Hadrosauridae (Dinosauria: Ornithopoda) using parsimony and Bayesian methods\n  | journal =Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society\n  | volume =159\n  | issue =2\n  | pages =435\u2013502\n  | year =2010\n  | doi =10.1111/j.1096-3642.2009.00617.x\n}}</ref>\n\nThe [[cladogram]] below follows Godefroit ''et al.''

{"title_page": "Abrasive", "text_new": "{{for|the Puddle of Mudd album|Abrasive (album)}}\n\nAn '''abrasive''' is a material, often a [[mineral]], that is used to shape or finish a workpiece through rubbing<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QHZyoKCxwKAC&pg=PA600|title=ENGINEERING CHEMISTRY|last=PALANNA|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Education|isbn=9781259081521|language=en}}</ref> which leads to part of the workpiece being worn away by [[friction]]. While finishing a material often means [[polishing]] it to gain a smooth, reflective surface, the process can also involve roughening as in satin, matte or beaded finishes. In short, the ceramics which are used to cut, grind and polish other softer materials are known as abrasives.\n\nAbrasives are extremely commonplace and are used very extensively in a wide variety of industrial, domestic, and technological applications. This gives rise to a large variation in the physical and chemical composition of abrasives as well as the shape of the abrasive. Some common uses for abrasives include [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], polishing, [[buffing]], [[honing (metalworking)|honing]], [[cutting]], [[drilling]], [[sharpening]], [[lapping]], and [[sanding]] (see [[abrasive machining]]). (For simplicity, \"mineral\" in this article will be used loosely to refer to both minerals and mineral-like substances whether man-made or not.)\n\n[[File (tool)|Files]] are not abrasives; they remove material not by scratching or rubbing, but by the cutting action of sharp teeth which have been cut into the surface of the file, very much like those of a saw. However, diamond files are a form of coated abrasive (as they are metal rods coated with diamond powder).\n\n== Mechanics of abrasion ==\n{{Main|Abrasion (mechanical)}}\nAbrasives generally rely upon a difference in hardness between the abrasive and the material being worked upon, the abrasive being the harder of the two substances. However,  is not necessary as any two solid materials that repeatedly rub against each other will tend to wear each other away; examples include, softer shoe soles wearing away wooden or stone steps over decades or centuries or [[glacier]]s abrading stone valleys.\n\nTypically, materials used as abrasives are either hard [[minerals]] (rated at 7 or above on [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]) or are synthetic stones, some of which may be chemically and physically identical to naturally occurring minerals but which cannot be called minerals as they did not arise naturally.  (While useful for comparative purposes, the Mohs scale is of limited value to materials engineers as it is an arbitrary, ordinal, irregular scale.)  [[Diamond]], a common abrasive, for instance occurs both naturally and is industrially produced, as is [[corundum]] which occurs naturally but which is  nowadays more commonly manufactured from [[bauxite]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abrasiveengineering.com/glossary.htm|title=Abrasives engineering glossary|accessdate=2007-04-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070402181503/http://www.abrasiveengineering.com/glossary.htm| archivedate= 2 April 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> However, even softer minerals like [[calcium carbonate]] are used as abrasives, such as \"polishing agents\" in toothpaste.\n\n[[File:Differences in the size of sand.jpg|thumb|right|Grit size ranging from 2&nbsp;mm (the large grain) (about F 10 using FEPA standards) to about 40 micrometres (about F 240 or P 360).]]\n\nThese minerals are either crushed or are already of a sufficiently small size (anywhere from macroscopic grains as large as about 2&nbsp;mm to microscopic grains about 0.001&nbsp;mm in diameter) to permit their use as an abrasive. These grains, commonly called grit, have rough edges, often terminating in points which will decrease the surface area in contact and increase the localised contact [[pressure]]. The abrasive and the material to be worked are brought into contact while in relative motion to each other. Force applied through the grains causes fragments of the worked material to break away, while simultaneously smoothing the abrasive grain and/or causing the grain to work loose from the rest of the abrasive.\n\nSome factors which will affect how quickly a substance is abraded include:\n*Difference in hardness between the two substances: a much harder abrasive will cut faster and deeper\n*Grain size (grit size): larger grains will cut faster as they also cut deeper\n*Adhesion between grains, between grains and backing, between grains and matrix: determines how quickly grains are lost from the abrasive and how soon fresh grains, if present, are exposed\n*Contact force: more force will cause faster abrasion\n*Loading: worn abrasive and cast off work material tends to fill spaces between abrasive grains so reducing cutting efficiency while increasing friction\n*Use of lubricant/coolant/metalworking fluid: Can carry away [[swarf]] (preventing loading), transport heat (which may affect the physical properties of the workpiece or the abrasive), decrease friction (with the substrate or matrix), suspend worn work material and abrasives allowing for a finer finish, conduct stress to the workpiece.\n\n== Abrasive minerals ==\n[[File:Diamond powder paste.jpg|thumb|Diamond powder paste]]\nAbrasives may be classified as either natural or synthetic. When discussing [[sharpening stone]]s, natural stones have long been considered superior but advances in material technology are seeing this distinction become less distinct. Many synthetic abrasives are effectively identical to a natural mineral, differing only in that the synthetic mineral has been manufactured rather than mined. Impurities in the natural mineral may make it less effective.\n\nSome naturally occurring abrasives are:\n* [[Calcite]] (calcium carbonate)\n* [[Emery (mineral)|Emery]] (impure corundum)\n* Diamond dust (synthetic diamonds are used extensively)\n* [[Novaculite]]\n* [[Pumice]]\n* [[Iron(III) oxide]]\n* [[Sand]]\n* [[Corundum]]\n* [[Garnet]]\n* [[Sandstone]]\n* [[Tripoli]](rotten stone)\n* Powdered [[feldspar]]\n* [[Staurolite]]\n\nSome abrasive minerals (such as [[zirconia alumina]]) occur naturally but are sufficiently rare or sufficiently more difficult or costly to obtain such that a synthetic stone is used industrially. These and other artificial abrasives include:\n* [[Borazon]] (cubic [[boron nitride]] or CBN)\n* [[Ceramic#Classification of technical ceramics|Ceramic]]\n* Ceramic aluminium oxide\n* Ceramic iron oxide\n* Corundum (alumina or [[aluminium oxide]])\n* [[Dry ice]]\n* [[Glass]] powder\n* [[Steel abrasives|Steel abrasive]]\n* [[Silicon carbide]] (carborundum)\n* Zirconia alumina\n* [[Boron carbide]]\n* [[Slag]]s\n\n\n== Manufactured abrasives ==\nAbrasives are shaped for various purposes. Natural abrasives are often sold as dressed stones, usually in the form of a rectangular block. Both natural and synthetic abrasives are commonly available in a wide variety of shapes, often coming as bonded or coated abrasives, including blocks, belts, discs, wheels, sheets, rods and loose grains.\n\n=== Bonded abrasives ===\n[[File:Grinding Wheels.jpg|thumb|right|Assorted grinding wheels as examples of bonded abrasives.]]\n[[File:Noe schleifstein.jpg|thumb|right|A grinding wheel with a reservoir to hold water as a lubricant and coolant.]]\n\nA '''bonded abrasive''' is composed of an abrasive material contained within a [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]], although very fine aluminium oxide abrasive may comprise [[sintering|sintered]] material. This matrix is called a binder and is often a [[clay]], a [[resin]], a glass or a [[rubber]]. This mixture of binder and abrasive is typically shaped into blocks, sticks, or wheels. The most common abrasive used is aluminium oxide. Also common are silicon carbide, [[tungsten carbide]] and [[garnet]]. Artificial sharpening stones are often a bonded abrasive and are readily available as a two sided block, each side being a different grade of grit.\n\n[[Grinding wheel]]s are cylinders that are rotated at high speed. While once worked with a foot pedal or hand crank, the introduction of electric motors has made it necessary to construct the wheel to withstand greater [[radial stress]] to prevent the wheel flying apart as it spins. Similar issues arise with [[Grinding wheel#Cut off wheels|cutting wheels]], which are often structurally reinforced with impregnated fibres. High relative speed between abrasive and workpiece often makes necessary the use of a lubricant of some kind. Traditionally, they were called [[coolant]]s as they were used to prevent frictional heat build up which could damage the workpiece (such as ruining the [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]] of a blade). Some research suggests that the heat transport property of a lubricant is less important when dealing with metals as the metal will quickly conduct heat from the work surface. More important are their effects upon lessening tensile stresses while increasing some compressive stresses and reducing \"thermal and mechanical stresses during chip formation\".<ref>''Grinding Stresses'', Grinding Wheel Institute, 1964</ref>\n\nVarious shapes are also used as heads on [[rotary tool]]s used in precision work, such as [[scale model]]ling.\n\nBonded abrasives need to be trued and dressed after they are used. Dressing is the cleaning of the waste material (swarf and loose abrasive) from the surface and exposing fresh grit. Depending upon the abrasive and how it was used, dressing may involve the abrasive being simply placed under running water and brushed with a stiff brush for a soft stone or the abrasive being ground against another abrasive, such as aluminium oxide used to dress a grinding wheel.\n\nTruing is restoring the abrasive to its original surface shape. Wheels and stones tend to wear unevenly, leaving the cutting surface no longer flat (said to be \"dished out\" if it is meant to be a flat stone) or no longer the same diameter across the cutting face. This will lead to uneven abrasion and other difficulties.\n\n=== Coated abrasives ===\n[[File:Schuurpapier2.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Germany|German]] sandpaper showing its backing and FEPA grit size.]]\n{{Main|Coated abrasive}}\n\nA ''coated abrasive'' comprises an abrasive fixed to a backing material such as [[paper]], [[cloth]], rubber, resin, [[polyester]] or even [[metal]], many of which are flexible. [[Sandpaper]] is a very common coated abrasive. Coated abrasives are most commonly the same minerals as are used for bonded abrasives. A bonding agent (often some sort of adhesive or resin) is applied to the backing to provide a flat surface to which the grit is then subsequently adhered. A woven backing may also use a filler agent (again, often a resin) to provide additional resilience.\n\nCoated abrasives may be shaped for use in rotary and orbital sanders, for wrapping around sanding blocks, as handpads, as closed loops for use on [[belt grinder]]s, as striking surfaces on [[match]]boxes, on [[diamond plate]]s and diamond steels. [[Diamond tools]], though for cutting, are often abrasive in nature.\n\n=== Other abrasives and their uses ===\n[[File:Abrasiveness RDA.JPG|thumb|right|Here the abrasiveness of toothpaste is detailed by its Relative [[Dentin]] Abrasivity (RDA)]]\nSand, glass beads, metal pellets [[copper slag]] and dry ice may all be used for a process called [[sandblasting]] (or similar, such as the use of glass beads which is \"bead blasting\"). Dry ice will [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]] leaving behind no residual abrasive.\n\n[[Cutting compound]] used on automotive paint is an example of an abrasive suspended in a liquid, paste or wax, as are some polishing liquids for [[silver]]ware and [[optical media]]. The liquid, paste or wax acts as a binding agent that keeps the abrasive attached to the cloth which is used as a backing to move the abrasive across the work piece. On cars in particular, wax may serve as both a protective agent by preventing exposure of the paint of metal to air and also act as an optical filler to make scratches less noticeable. [[Toothpaste]] contains calcium carbonate or [[silica]] as a \"polishing agent\" to remove plaque and other matter from teeth as the hardness of calcium carbonate is less than that of [[tooth enamel]] but more than that of the contaminating agent.\n\nVery fine rouge powder was commonly used for grinding glass, being somewhat replaced by modern ceramics, and is still used in jewellery making for a highly reflective finish.\n\nCleaning products may also contain abrasives suspended in a paste or cream. They are chosen to be reasonably safe on some [[linoleum]], [[tile]], metal or stone surfaces. However, many [[laminate]] surfaces and ceramic topped stoves are easily damaged by these abrasive compounds. Even ceramic/pottery tableware or cookware can damage these surfaces, particularly the bottom of the tableware, which is often unglazed in part or in whole and acts as simply another bonded abrasive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://duratech.co.nz/products/bisonne_laminates_and_sinkware/care_and_maintenance/|title=Care of laminate surface|accessdate=2007-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224023247/http://duratech.co.nz/products/bisonne_laminates_and_sinkware/care_and_maintenance/|archivedate=2007-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMetal pots and stoves are often scoured with abrasive cleaners, typically in the form of the aforementioned cream or paste or of [[steel wool]] and non woven [[scouring pad]]s which holds fine grits abrasives.\n\nHuman skin is also subjected to abrasion in the form of exfoliation. Abrasives for this can be much softer and more exotic than for other purposes and may include things like [[almond]] and [[oatmeal]].<ref>Nutrimetics, Honey and Almond Scrub</ref> [[Dermabrasion]] and [[microdermabrasion]] are now rather commonplace cosmetic procedures which use mineral abrasives.\n\nScratched compact discs and [[DVD]]s may sometimes be repaired through buffing with a very fine compound, the principle being that a multitude of small scratches will be more optically transparent than a single large scratch. However, this does take some skill and will eventually cause the protective coating of the disc to be entirely eroded (especially if the original scratch is deep), at which time, the data surface will be destroyed if abrasion continues.\n\n== Choice of abrasive ==\nThe shape, size and nature of the workpiece and the desired finish will influence the choice of the abrasive used. A bonded abrasive grind wheel may be used to commercially sharpen a knife (producing a [[Grind#Typical grinds|hollow grind]]), but an individual may then sharpen the same knife with a natural sharpening stone or an even flexible coated abrasive (like a sandpaper) stuck to a soft, non-slip surface to make achieving a convex grind easier. Similarly, a brass mirror may be cut with a bonded abrasive, have its surface flattened with a coated abrasive to achieve a basic shape, and then have finer grades of abrasive successively applied culminating in a wax paste impregnated with rouge to leave a sort of \"grainless finish\" called, in this case, a \"mirror finish\".\n\nAlso, different shapes of adhesive may make it harder to abrade certain areas of the workpiece. Health hazards can arise from any dust produced (which may be ameliorated through the use of a lubricant) which could lead to [[silicosis]] (when the abrasive or workpiece is a [[silicate]]) and the choice of any lubricant. Besides water, oils are the most common lubricants. These may present inhalation hazards, contact hazards and, as friction necessarily produces heat, flammable material hazards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/metalworking_fluids.html|title=OSH Answers: Metalworking fluids|accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn abrasive which is too hard or too coarse can remove too much material or leave undesired scratch marks. Besides being unsightly, scratching can have other, more serious effects. Excessive abrasion or the presence of scratches may:\n*diminish or destroy usefulness (as in the case of scratching [[optical lens]]es and [[compact disc]]s or dulling [[Knife|knives]]);\n*trap dirt, water, or other material;\n*increase surface area (permitting greater [[chemical reactivity]] such as increased [[rust]]ing which is also affected by matter caught in scratches);\n*erode or penetrate a coating (such as a paint or a chemical or wear resistant coating);\n*overly quickly cause an object to wear away (such as a blade or a gemstone);\n*increase friction (as in [[jewel bearing|jeweled bearings]] and [[piston]]s).\n\nA finer or softer abrasive will tend to leave much finer scratch marks which may even be invisible to the naked eye (a \"grainless finish\"); a softer abrasive may not even significantly abrade a certain object. A softer or finer abrasive will take longer to cut, as it tends to cut less deeply than a coarser, harder material. Also, the softer abrasive may become less effective more quickly as the abrasive is itself abraded. This allows fine abrasives to be used in the polishing of metal and [[lens (optics)|lenses]] where the series of increasingly fine scratches tends to take on a much more shiny or reflective appearance or greater [[transparency (optics)|transparency]]. Very fine abrasives may be used to coat the [[strop]] for a cut-throat [[razor]]s, however, the purpose of stropping is not to abrade material but to straighten the burr on an edge. The final stage of sharpening [[Japanese sword]]s is called polishing and may be a form of [[superfinishing]].\n\nDifferent chemical or structural modifications may be made to alter the cutting properties of the abrasive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fepa-abrasives.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?portalname=www.fepa-abrasives.org&language=E&folderindex=0&folderid=3&headingindex=3&headingid=79&tabindex=0&tabid=270|title=FEPA Structure|accessdate=2007-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070305023428/http://www.fepa-abrasives.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?portalname=www.fepa-abrasives.org&language=E&folderindex=0&folderid=3&headingindex=3&headingid=79&tabindex=0&tabid=270| archivedate= 5 March 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nOther very important considerations are price and availability. Diamond, for a long time considered the hardest substance in existence, is actually softer than [[fullerite]] and even harder [[aggregated diamond nanorod]]s, both of which have been synthesised in laboratories, but no commercial process has yet been developed. Diamond itself is expensive due to scarcity in nature and the cost of synthesising it. Bauxite is a very common [[ore]] which, along with corundum's reasonably high hardness, contributes to corundum's status as a common, inexpensive abrasive.\n\nThought must be given to the desired task about using an appropriately hard abrasive. At one end, using an excessively hard abrasive wastes money by wearing it down when a cheaper, less hard abrasive would suffice. At the other end, if the abrasive substance is too soft, abrasion does not take place in a timely fashion, effectively wasting the abrasive as well as any accruing costs associated with loss of time.\n\n== Other instances of abrasion ==\nAside from the aforementioned uses of shaping and finishing, abrasives may also be used to prepare surfaces for application of some sort of paint of adhesive. An excessively smooth surface may prevent paint and [[adhesive]]s from adhering as strongly as an irregular surface could allow. Inflatable [[tire|tyre]] repair kits (which, on bicycles particularly, are actually patches for the [[inner tube]] rather than the tyre) require use of an abrasive so that the self-[[vulcanisation|vulcanising]] [[cement]] will stick strongly.\n\nInadvertently, people who use knives on glass or metal [[cutting board]]s are abrading their knife blades. The pressure at the knife edge can easily create microscopic (or even macroscopic) cuts in the board. This cut is a ready source of abrasive material as well as a channel full of this abrasive through which the edge slides. For this reason, and without regard for the health benefits, wooden boards are much more desirable. A similar occurrence arises with [[glass cutter|glass-cutters]]. Glass-cutters have circular blades that are designed to roll not slide. They should never retrace an already effected cut.\n\nUndesired abrasion may result from the presence of [[carbon]] in [[internal combustion engine]]s.

While finishing a material often means [[polishing]] it to gain a smooth, reflective surface, the process can also involve roughening as in satin, matte or beaded finishes. In short, the ceramics which are used to cut, grind and polish other softer materials are known as abrasives.\n\nAbrasives are extremely commonplace and are used very extensively in a wide variety of industrial, domestic, and technological applications. This gives rise to a large variation in the physical and chemical composition of abrasives as well as the shape of the abrasive. Some common uses for abrasives include [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]], polishing, [[buffing]], [[honing (metalworking)|honing]], [[cutting]], [[drilling]], [[sharpening]], [[lapping]], and [[sanding]] (see [[abrasive machining]]). (For simplicity, \"mineral\" in this article will be used loosely to refer to both minerals and mineral-like substances whether man-made or not.)\n\n[[File (tool)|Files]] are not abrasives; they remove material not by scratching or rubbing, but by the cutting action of sharp teeth which have been cut into the surface of the file, very much like those of a saw. However, diamond files are a form of coated abrasive (as they are metal rods coated with diamond powder).\n\n== Mechanics of abrasion ==\n{{Main|Abrasion (mechanical)}}\nAbrasives generally rely upon a difference in hardness between the abrasive and the material being worked upon, the abrasive being the harder of the two substances. However,  is not necessary as any two solid materials that repeatedly rub against each other will tend to wear each other away; examples include, softer shoe soles wearing away wooden or stone steps over decades or centuries or [[glacier]]s abrading stone valleys.\n\nTypically, materials used as abrasives are either hard [[minerals]] (rated at 7 or above on [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness]]) or are synthetic stones, some of which may be chemically and physically identical to naturally occurring minerals but which cannot be called minerals as they did not arise naturally.  (While useful for comparative purposes, the Mohs scale is of limited value to materials engineers as it is an arbitrary, ordinal, irregular scale.)  [[Diamond]], a common abrasive, for instance occurs both naturally and is industrially produced, as is [[corundum]] which occurs naturally but which is  nowadays more commonly manufactured from [[bauxite]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abrasiveengineering.com/glossary.htm|title=Abrasives engineering glossary|accessdate=2007-04-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070402181503/http://www.abrasiveengineering.com/glossary.htm| archivedate= 2 April 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> However, even softer minerals like [[calcium carbonate]] are used as abrasives, such as \"polishing agents\" in toothpaste.\n\n[[File:Differences in the size of sand.jpg|thumb|right|Grit size ranging from 2&nbsp;mm (the large grain) (about F 10 using FEPA standards) to about 40 micrometres (about F 240 or P 360).]]\n\nThese minerals are either crushed or are already of a sufficiently small size (anywhere from macroscopic grains as large as about 2&nbsp;mm to microscopic grains about 0.001&nbsp;mm in diameter) to permit their use as an abrasive. These grains, commonly called grit, have rough edges, often terminating in points which will decrease the surface area in contact and increase the localised contact [[pressure]]. The abrasive and the material to be worked are brought into contact while in relative motion to each other. Force applied through the grains causes fragments of the worked material to break away, while simultaneously smoothing the abrasive grain and/or causing the grain to work loose from the rest of the abrasive.\n\nSome factors which will affect how quickly a substance is abraded include:\n*Difference in hardness between the two substances: a much harder abrasive will cut faster and deeper\n*Grain size (grit size): larger grains will cut faster as they also cut deeper\n*Adhesion between grains, between grains and backing, between grains and matrix: determines how quickly grains are lost from the abrasive and how soon fresh grains, if present, are exposed\n*Contact force: more force will cause faster abrasion\n*Loading: worn abrasive and cast off work material tends to fill spaces between abrasive grains so reducing cutting efficiency while increasing friction\n*Use of lubricant/coolant/metalworking fluid: Can carry away [[swarf]] (preventing loading), transport heat (which may affect the physical properties of the workpiece or the abrasive), decrease friction (with the substrate or matrix), suspend worn work material and abrasives allowing for a finer finish, conduct stress to the workpiece.\n\n== Abrasive minerals ==\n[[File:Diamond powder paste.jpg|thumb|Diamond powder paste]]\nAbrasives may be classified as either natural or synthetic. When discussing [[sharpening stone]]s, natural stones have long been considered superior but advances in material technology are seeing this distinction become less distinct. Many synthetic abrasives are effectively identical to a natural mineral, differing only in that the synthetic mineral has been manufactured rather than mined. Impurities in the natural mineral may make it less effective.\n\nSome naturally occurring abrasives are:\n* [[Calcite]] (calcium carbonate)\n* [[Emery (mineral)|Emery]] (impure corundum)\n* Diamond dust (synthetic diamonds are used extensively)\n* [[Novaculite]]\n* [[Pumice]]\n* [[Iron(III) oxide]]\n* [[Sand]]\n* [[Corundum]]\n* [[Garnet]]\n* [[Sandstone]]\n* [[Tripoli]](rotten stone)\n* Powdered [[feldspar]]\n* [[Staurolite]]\n\nSome abrasive minerals (such as [[zirconia alumina]]) occur naturally but are sufficiently rare or sufficiently more difficult or costly to obtain such that a synthetic stone is used industrially. These and other artificial abrasives include:\n* [[Borazon]] (cubic [[boron nitride]] or CBN)\n* [[Ceramic#Classification of technical ceramics|Ceramic]]\n* Ceramic aluminium oxide\n* Ceramic iron oxide\n* Corundum (alumina or [[aluminium oxide]])\n* [[Dry ice]]\n* [[Glass]] powder\n* [[Steel abrasives|Steel abrasive]]\n* [[Silicon carbide]] (carborundum)\n* Zirconia alumina\n* [[Boron carbide]]\n* [[Slag]]s\n\n\n== Manufactured abrasives ==\nAbrasives are shaped for various purposes. Natural abrasives are often sold as dressed stones, usually in the form of a rectangular block. Both natural and synthetic abrasives are commonly available in a wide variety of shapes, often coming as bonded or coated abrasives, including blocks, belts, discs, wheels, sheets, rods and loose grains.\n\n=== Bonded abrasives ===\n[[File:Grinding Wheels.jpg|thumb|right|Assorted grinding wheels as examples of bonded abrasives.]]\n[[File:Noe schleifstein.jpg|thumb|right|A grinding wheel with a reservoir to hold water as a lubricant and coolant.]]\n\nA '''bonded abrasive''' is composed of an abrasive material contained within a [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]], although very fine aluminium oxide abrasive may comprise [[sintering|sintered]] material. This matrix is called a binder and is often a [[clay]], a [[resin]], a glass or a [[rubber]]. This mixture of binder and abrasive is typically shaped into blocks, sticks, or wheels. The most common abrasive used is aluminium oxide. Also common are silicon carbide, [[tungsten carbide]] and [[garnet]]. Artificial sharpening stones are often a bonded abrasive and are readily available as a two sided block, each side being a different grade of grit.\n\n[[Grinding wheel]]s are cylinders that are rotated at high speed. While once worked with a foot pedal or hand crank, the introduction of electric motors has made it necessary to construct the wheel to withstand greater [[radial stress]] to prevent the wheel flying apart as it spins. Similar issues arise with [[Grinding wheel#Cut off wheels|cutting wheels]], which are often structurally reinforced with impregnated fibres. High relative speed between abrasive and workpiece often makes necessary the use of a lubricant of some kind. Traditionally, they were called [[coolant]]s as they were used to prevent frictional heat build up which could damage the workpiece (such as ruining the [[tempering (metallurgy)|temper]] of a blade). Some research suggests that the heat transport property of a lubricant is less important when dealing with metals as the metal will quickly conduct heat from the work surface. More important are their effects upon lessening tensile stresses while increasing some compressive stresses and reducing \"thermal and mechanical stresses during chip formation\".<ref>''Grinding Stresses'', Grinding Wheel Institute, 1964</ref>\n\nVarious shapes are also used as heads on [[rotary tool]]s used in precision work, such as [[scale model]]ling.\n\nBonded abrasives need to be trued and dressed after they are used. Dressing is the cleaning of the waste material (swarf and loose abrasive) from the surface and exposing fresh grit. Depending upon the abrasive and how it was used, dressing may involve the abrasive being simply placed under running water and brushed with a stiff brush for a soft stone or the abrasive being ground against another abrasive, such as aluminium oxide used to dress a grinding wheel.\n\nTruing is restoring the abrasive to its original surface shape. Wheels and stones tend to wear unevenly, leaving the cutting surface no longer flat (said to be \"dished out\" if it is meant to be a flat stone) or no longer the same diameter across the cutting face. This will lead to uneven abrasion and other difficulties.\n\n=== Coated abrasives ===\n[[File:Schuurpapier2.JPG|thumb|right|A [[Germany|German]] sandpaper showing its backing and FEPA grit size.]]\n{{Main|Coated abrasive}}\n\nA ''coated abrasive'' comprises an abrasive fixed to a backing material such as [[paper]], [[cloth]], rubber, resin, [[polyester]] or even [[metal]], many of which are flexible. [[Sandpaper]] is a very common coated abrasive. Coated abrasives are most commonly the same minerals as are used for bonded abrasives. A bonding agent (often some sort of adhesive or resin) is applied to the backing to provide a flat surface to which the grit is then subsequently adhered. A woven backing may also use a filler agent (again, often a resin) to provide additional resilience.\n\nCoated abrasives may be shaped for use in rotary and orbital sanders, for wrapping around sanding blocks, as handpads, as closed loops for use on [[belt grinder]]s, as striking surfaces on [[match]]boxes, on [[diamond plate]]s and diamond steels. [[Diamond tools]], though for cutting, are often abrasive in nature.\n\n=== Other abrasives and their uses ===\n[[File:Abrasiveness RDA.JPG|thumb|right|Here the abrasiveness of toothpaste is detailed by its Relative [[Dentin]] Abrasivity (RDA)]]\nSand, glass beads, metal pellets [[copper slag]] and dry ice may all be used for a process called [[sandblasting]] (or similar, such as the use of glass beads which is \"bead blasting\"). Dry ice will [[Sublimation (chemistry)|sublimate]] leaving behind no residual abrasive.\n\n[[Cutting compound]] used on automotive paint is an example of an abrasive suspended in a liquid, paste or wax, as are some polishing liquids for [[silver]]ware and [[optical media]]. The liquid, paste or wax acts as a binding agent that keeps the abrasive attached to the cloth which is used as a backing to move the abrasive across the work piece. On cars in particular, wax may serve as both a protective agent by preventing exposure of the paint of metal to air and also act as an optical filler to make scratches less noticeable. [[Toothpaste]] contains calcium carbonate or [[silica]] as a \"polishing agent\" to remove plaque and other matter from teeth as the hardness of calcium carbonate is less than that of [[tooth enamel]] but more than that of the contaminating agent.\n\nVery fine rouge powder was commonly used for grinding glass, being somewhat replaced by modern ceramics, and is still used in jewellery making for a highly reflective finish.\n\nCleaning products may also contain abrasives suspended in a paste or cream. They are chosen to be reasonably safe on some [[linoleum]], [[tile]], metal or stone surfaces. However, many [[laminate]] surfaces and ceramic topped stoves are easily damaged by these abrasive compounds. Even ceramic/pottery tableware or cookware can damage these surfaces, particularly the bottom of the tableware, which is often unglazed in part or in whole and acts as simply another bonded abrasive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://duratech.co.nz/products/bisonne_laminates_and_sinkware/care_and_maintenance/|title=Care of laminate surface|accessdate=2007-04-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224023247/http://duratech.co.nz/products/bisonne_laminates_and_sinkware/care_and_maintenance/|archivedate=2007-02-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMetal pots and stoves are often scoured with abrasive cleaners, typically in the form of the aforementioned cream or paste or of [[steel wool]] and non woven [[scouring pad]]s which holds fine grits abrasives.\n\nHuman skin is also subjected to abrasion in the form of exfoliation. Abrasives for this can be much softer and more exotic than for other purposes and may include things like [[almond]] and [[oatmeal]].<ref>Nutrimetics, Honey and Almond Scrub</ref> [[Dermabrasion]] and [[microdermabrasion]] are now rather commonplace cosmetic procedures which use mineral abrasives.\n\nScratched compact discs and [[DVD]]s may sometimes be repaired through buffing with a very fine compound, the principle being that a multitude of small scratches will be more optically transparent than a single large scratch. However, this does take some skill and will eventually cause the protective coating of the disc to be entirely eroded (especially if the original scratch is deep), at which time, the data surface will be destroyed if abrasion continues.\n\n== Choice of abrasive ==\nThe shape, size and nature of the workpiece and the desired finish will influence the choice of the abrasive used. A bonded abrasive grind wheel may be used to commercially sharpen a knife (producing a [[Grind#Typical grinds|hollow grind]]), but an individual may then sharpen the same knife with a natural sharpening stone or an even flexible coated abrasive (like a sandpaper) stuck to a soft, non-slip surface to make achieving a convex grind easier. Similarly, a brass mirror may be cut with a bonded abrasive, have its surface flattened with a coated abrasive to achieve a basic shape, and then have finer grades of abrasive successively applied culminating in a wax paste impregnated with rouge to leave a sort of \"grainless finish\" called, in this case, a \"mirror finish\".\n\nAlso, different shapes of adhesive may make it harder to abrade certain areas of the workpiece. Health hazards can arise from any dust produced (which may be ameliorated through the use of a lubricant) which could lead to [[silicosis]] (when the abrasive or workpiece is a [[silicate]]) and the choice of any lubricant. Besides water, oils are the most common lubricants. These may present inhalation hazards, contact hazards and, as friction necessarily produces heat, flammable material hazards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccohs.ca/oshanswers/chemicals/metalworking_fluids.html|title=OSH Answers: Metalworking fluids|accessdate=2007-04-06}}</ref>\n\nAn abrasive which is too hard or too coarse can remove too much material or leave undesired scratch marks. Besides being unsightly, scratching can have other, more serious effects. Excessive abrasion or the presence of scratches may:\n*diminish or destroy usefulness (as in the case of scratching [[optical lens]]es and [[compact disc]]s or dulling [[Knife|knives]]);\n*trap dirt, water, or other material;\n*increase surface area (permitting greater [[chemical reactivity]] such as increased [[rust]]ing which is also affected by matter caught in scratches);\n*erode or penetrate a coating (such as a paint or a chemical or wear resistant coating);\n*overly quickly cause an object to wear away (such as a blade or a gemstone);\n*increase friction (as in [[jewel bearing|jeweled bearings]] and [[piston]]s).\n\nA finer or softer abrasive will tend to leave much finer scratch marks which may even be invisible to the naked eye (a \"grainless finish\"); a softer abrasive may not even significantly abrade a certain object. A softer or finer abrasive will take longer to cut, as it tends to cut less deeply than a coarser, harder material. Also, the softer abrasive may become less effective more quickly as the abrasive is itself abraded. This allows fine abrasives to be used in the polishing of metal and [[lens (optics)|lenses]] where the series of increasingly fine scratches tends to take on a much more shiny or reflective appearance or greater [[transparency (optics)|transparency]]. Very fine abrasives may be used to coat the [[strop]] for a cut-throat [[razor]]s, however, the purpose of stropping is not to abrade material but to straighten the burr on an edge. The final stage of sharpening [[Japanese sword]]s is called polishing and may be a form of [[superfinishing]].\n\nDifferent chemical or structural modifications may be made to alter the cutting properties of the abrasive.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fepa-abrasives.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?portalname=www.fepa-abrasives.org&language=E&folderindex=0&folderid=3&headingindex=3&headingid=79&tabindex=0&tabid=270|title=FEPA Structure|accessdate=2007-04-05| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070305023428/http://www.fepa-abrasives.org/DesktopDefault.aspx?portalname=www.fepa-abrasives.org&language=E&folderindex=0&folderid=3&headingindex=3&headingid=79&tabindex=0&tabid=270| archivedate= 5 March 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nOther very important considerations are price and availability. Diamond, for a long time considered the hardest substance in existence, is actually softer than [[fullerite]] and even harder [[aggregated diamond nanorod]]s, both of which have been synthesised in laboratories, but no commercial process has yet been developed. Diamond itself is expensive due to scarcity in nature and the cost of synthesising it. Bauxite is a very common [[ore]] which, along with corundum's reasonably high hardness, contributes to corundum's status as a common, inexpensive abrasive.\n\nThought must be given to the desired task about using an appropriately hard abrasive. At one end, using an excessively hard abrasive wastes money by wearing it down when a cheaper, less hard abrasive would suffice. At the other end, if the abrasive substance is too soft, abrasion does not take place in a timely fashion, effectively wasting the abrasive as well as any accruing costs associated with loss of time.\n\n== Other instances of abrasion ==\nAside from the aforementioned uses of shaping and finishing, abrasives may also be used to prepare surfaces for application of some sort of paint of adhesive. An excessively smooth surface may prevent paint and [[adhesive]]s from adhering as strongly as an irregular surface could allow. Inflatable [[tire|tyre]] repair kits (which, on bicycles particularly, are actually patches for the [[inner tube]] rather than the tyre) require use of an abrasive so that the self-[[vulcanisation|vulcanising]] [[cement]] will stick strongly.\n\nInadvertently, people who use knives on glass or metal [[cutting board]]s are abrading their knife blades. The pressure at the knife edge can easily create microscopic (or even macroscopic) cuts in the board. This cut is a ready source of abrasive material as well as a channel full of this abrasive through which the edge slides. For this reason, and without regard for the health benefits, wooden boards are much more desirable. A similar occurrence arises with [[glass cutter|glass-cutters]]. Glass-cutters have circular blades that are designed to roll not slide. They should never retrace an already effected cut.\n\nUndesired abrasion may result from the presence of [[carbon]] in [[internal combustion engine]]s. While smaller particles are readily transported by the lubrication system, larger carbon particles may abrade components with close [[Engineering tolerance|tolerances]]. The carbon arises from the excessive heating of [[engine oil]] or from [[incomplete combustion]]. This soot may contain [[fullerenes]] which are noted for their extreme hardness\u2014and small size and limited quantity which would tend to limit their effect.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Abrasion (mechanical)]]\n*[[Abrasive blasting]]\n*[[Erosion]]\n*[[Steel abrasive]]\n*[[Tribology]]\n*[[Wear]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wiktionary}}\n*{{dmoz|Business/Materials/Abrasives|Abrasives}}\n*{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Abrasives |short=x}}\n* [http://mcfinishing.com/resources/abrasivetech.pdf Metal and Composite Finishing Inc., Abrasive Technical Information]\n\n{{Woodworking}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Abrasives| ]]\n[[Category:Materials with minor glass phase]]\n[[Category:Metalworking]]\n[[Category:Woodworking]]\n[[Category:Carving]]\n[[Category:Stone (material)]]\n", "name_user": "Dawnseeker2000", "label": "safe", "comment": "Script-assisted fixes: perCS1andMOS:ITALICS", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abrasive"}

They are excellent jumpers due to their long, slender legs. The typical webbing found on their hind feet allows for easy movement through water. Coloration is mostly greens and browns above, with darker and yellowish spots.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nMany frogs in this genus breed in early spring, although [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] [[species]] may breed throughout the year. Males of most of the species are known to call, but a few species are thought to be voiceless.  Females lay eggs in rafts or large, globular clusters, and can produce up to 20,000 at one time.\n\n==Diet==\n''Rana'' species feed mainly on insects and invertebrates, but swallow anything they can fit into their mouths,{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} including small vertebrates. Among their predators are egrets, crocodiles, and snakes.\n\n==Systematics==\nSome 50 to 100 extant species are now placed in this genus by various authors; many other species formerly placed in ''Rana'' are now placed elsewhere.

They are excellent jumpers due to their long, slender legs. The typical webbing found on their hind feet allows for easy movement through water. Coloration is mostly greens and browns above, with darker and yellowish spots.\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nMany frogs in this genus breed in early spring, although [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] [[species]] may breed throughout the year. Males of most of the species are known to call, but a few species are thought to be voiceless.  Females lay eggs in rafts or large, globular clusters, and can produce up to 20,000 at one time.\n\n==Diet==\n''Rana'' species feed mainly on insects and invertebrates, but swallow anything they can fit into their mouths,{{cn|date=January 2020}} including small vertebrates. Among their predators are egrets, crocodiles, and snakes.\n\n==Systematics==\nSome 50 to 100 extant species are now placed in this genus by various authors; many other species formerly placed in ''Rana'' are now placed elsewhere.

The move to a new channel frequency resulted in it being renamed Program 2 and becoming the second home of the national newscast [[Vremya]] since 1968.\n\nProgram 2 officially renamed itself  All-Union Program 2 in 1972 and converted to color in 1975, and two years later became a nationwide station, being broadcast all over the Soviet Union. On January 1, 1982 AUP2 officially began to broadcast, not just educational and children's programming but also culture and arts programming and sports, as it was officially permitted to take greater account of the needs and tastes of spectators in a changing era. In addition, it broadcast also documentaries, music videos and programming, and movies.\n\nStarting New Year's Day 1984, All Union Program 2 was renamed All-Union Channel 2, and it pioneered the first ever rhythmic gymnastics broadcast the following year. By 1987, it was also the first channel to adopt sign language interpretation in the USSR and later supplemented by subtitles for the hard of hearing, all for its Vremya broadcast.\n\nThe official identification package for the channel was the star of the second antenna on a blue background with moving rings, symbolizing the radio waves, and the signature at the bottom of \"II program\", which then changed to \"TV USSR.\" Around February 1988, a new ident replaced it: circles were fixed, disappeared inscription \"TV USSR\", and the background was light blue with a white gradient.\n\nSince 1989, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) implemented the organization of the Russian national TV channel. By this time all the Union republics, with the exception of Russia, had their own TV channels. In 1990, the creator of the program \"The Fifth Wheel\", People's Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR Bella Kurkova requested the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Russia, [[Boris Yeltsin]] to create a separate Russian television station for the RSFSR, due to the fact that the central television channels reflect the views of the federal authorities. At that time, the country experienced a confrontation between the union and republican authorities.<ref>\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\". \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0446\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442\". \u0414\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c, 2011.</ref>\n\nOn July 13, 1990 a decision of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] ended the national monopoly on radio and television broadcasting in the RSFSR, clearing the way for it to launch its own TV and radio stations. Prior to September 15, 1990, according to the decree, the Cabinet of Ministers of the RSFSR, Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, and the CM Committee on the media, communications with public organizations, mass movements of citizens and public opinion research should address the issue of the ownership of the material-technical base of AUC2. On July 14, 1990 decree \u2116 107-1 of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the RSFSR officially established the [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company]]. Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR Ivan Silaev helped acquire the building and the equipment for the future station.<ref>[http://rkn.gov.ru/mass-communications/reestr/media/?id=405802&page= \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f HD]</ref>\n\nThus, Russia-1 is the successor to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Second Channel (Soviet Union)|Second Channel]] launched in 1963. As of 2000, it is headed by [[Oleg Dobrodeyev]], who was a founder of the original [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]].<ref name=Bessudnov />\n\n===Russian Federation===\n\n====1990s====\nAfter 27 years, the All-Union State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company turned over the operations of AUC2 on March 6, 1991 to the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, with Oleg Poptsov as its founding chairman. At the same time, the leadership of the company had been promised at least a 6-hour broadcast day as a national blocktimer for viewers within Russia, including a brand-new 20-minute newscast to be aired twice daily on the new channel. Due to the opposition views of the Republican team, the new management staff, led by the new GM for the soon to be re-branded Russian Television, Sergei Podgorbunsky, faced difficulties ranging from an inability to rent a studio in the telecentre \"Ostankino\" to failure to provide the promised before air time for new programs.<ref>[http://www.continent-tv.ru/continent-tv/news/3667165/ \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u00ab\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f HD\u00bb \u2014 \u043d\u0430 \u00ab\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0422\u0412\u00bb \u0438 \u00ab\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u00bb! | \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0422\u0412]</ref>\n\nAt the same time, there were problems with the recruitment of new employees, program presenters and staff for the new station. Many presenters left the Union STRC free from TV censorship. As a result, the station management started to brainstorm and conceptualize its programming from scratch, including news and current affairs. Thus, \"Vesti\", the news program of RTV, was born, with airing time being at 18:00 and 20:00, twice nightly on weekdays (The 2nd edition was to be aired before its simulcast of Vremya). Most of the staff of \"Vesti\" on \"Russian Television\" were former presenters and staff of Central Television program \"Television News Service\", their experience would help the new channel in its news services. Four studios - \"News\" for newscasts, \"Republic\" for current affairs, \"Lad\" for arts and culture and \"Artel\" for entertainment and lifestyle were created.<ref>[http://www.rsoc.ru/mass-communications/reestr/media/?id=405802&page= \u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043e \u0421\u041c\u0418 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u00ab\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f HD\u00bb | \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u0420\u0424]</ref>\n\nOn May 13, 1991 recently appointed to the post of deputy general manager of the State Television and Radio Valentin Lazutkin officially launched the brand new ARSTV Channel 2 with air times from 11.35 to 13.35, from 17.00 to 19.00 and from 21.45 to 23.45, weekdays and weekends, with AUC2 filling the rest of the schedule. It was given a new corporate logo and a new brand name: \"Russian Television\".\n\nAt 17.00 \"Vesti\" made its premiere telecast, with [[Svetlana Sorokina]] hosting. From this time on Russian Television aired programming not only from the All-Union State Television and Radio but also from the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company. Compared with \"[[Vremya]]\", \"Vesti\" became the acute, short, specific and operational newscast Russians watched, without any censorship or bias. In the first week of broadcasting, \"Good night, kids!\" And Odessa \"Gentleman show\" made their premiere telecasts. Two weeks later, \"RTR\" (\"Russian Television and Radio\") became the new name of the channel, and a new logo debuted.\n\nIn August 1991, RTR stopped broadcasting in Latvia and was replaced by LTV2 (now LTV7).\n\nDuring the August coup, on August 19, 1991 the Emergency Committee stopped the broadcast of RTR, and AUC2 officially returned in the evening slots, with its planned programs including the great ballet \"Swan Lake\". Unknown to the coup leaders, RTR secretly organized a broadcast to the United States and other countries, as well as all over the USSR, so that all Soviets saw a special edition of \"Vesti\" with the latest events in Moscow during the coup. Studio \"Vesti\" in the \"Ostankino\" Center was blocked by AUC2 management, the transfer was recorded on video tape to \"Shabolovke\" for emergency situations has been prepared by an OB van and outside mobile facilities that the young channel had. The Emergency Committee blocked RTR headquarters on Yamskov field. In less than a few days, RTR had Clandestine broadcasts nationwide till the coup had failed.  After the August Coup \"RTR\" by order of Valentin Lazutkin, its deputy GM for operations, officially resumed broadcasting this time from 19.00 to 00.00 (instead of 17.00 to 19.00 and 21.45 to 23.45).\n\nOn September 16, 1991 AUC2 ended its operations and RTR absorbed several of its staff and programs, therefore beginning the next day it began to broadcast from the very morning till late at midnight.  On 30 December 1991 the program \"Vesti\" began to appear three times a day, and from 20 January 1992 to four times a day. In 1993, the channel changed its logo 2 times.\n\nIn February 1992, on the basis of the frequencies of RTR in Ukraine, channel UT-2 (now 1 +1) was launched.\n\nDuring the political crisis of 1993 RTR aired interviews from the different sides of the spectrum, from politicians to ordinary people. During the shooting of the White House, the director of the channel had violated the order to conduct the bombing broadcast live on that point, as long as the line of fire to avoid civilian casualties among the citizens of Moscow. After the police pushed the townspeople, \"RTR\" started broadcasting \"CNN\". At that time the building was shelled, which housed the studio of \"Vesti\". In a hole punched in the building of a grenade launcher, armed men broke into the studios and began shelling the building on fire.\n\nThe director of the program \"Vesti\" Irina Vinogradova was able to save the footage. Technical Director Stanislav Bunevich able to carry TV broadcasts control of the country in building the All-Russian STRC on Yamskov field. Broadcasting channel was restored, \"RTR\" was the only television channel, remaining on the air and which showed the 1993 First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Shumeyko \"Vesti\" were donated to the mantel clock. events. Broadcasting was done in a hurry equipped studio in the basement with the lights off. Later, in a building opposite were found maturation snipers. For coverage of \n\nShowing important events, \"Vesti\" become the most influential program on RTR.  In the same year, Yuri Rostov, [[Vladislav Flyarkovsky]] and Alexander Gurnov started their jobs as field reporters for the channel under then head of news programming Alexander Nekhoroshev.\n\nSince 1994, the program began to leave a comment, \"Details\", which became a leading political commentator [[Nikolai Svanidze]] news. In October 1995, the RTR with ORT program went \"Ivanov, Petrov, Sidorov.\"\n\nIn 1996 Oleg Poptsov, Anatoly Lysenko, Alexander and Alexander Podgorbunsky Nekhoroshev were relieved of their posts, and Details was pulled off. The new chairman of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Company [[Eduard Sagalaev]] was appointed, and Cyril Legat chosen as the new GM for television, editor in chief of information programs of Russian Television Boris Forgetful. The channel will have emerged a number of new programs - information-analytical program \"Mirror\", which became a leading Nikolai Svanidze, the actual interview \"VIP\", talk show \"Open News\", which became the leading Edward Sagalaev, Svetlana Sorokina and Oksana Naychuk a manufacturer of private television ATV.\n\nIn 1997, the chairman of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Company was Nikolai Svanidze. Programs \"VIP\" and \"Open News\" were closed, she was dismissed leading \"Vesti\" Svetlana Sorokina. On November of that year, \"RTR\" changed to \"RTR-1\" has changed the logo. The reason for the name change - the creation of a new TV channel \"RTR-2\" (now \"Russia-Culture\").\n\nOn May 8, 1998 in the RTR includes regional television and radio. Since then, \"RTR\" broadcasts in 54 languages of the peoples of Russia, RTR became the largest media group in Europe. The general is not only the design of the channel, but the editorial policy. On 7 September of that year, on the air for the first time block out the morning program \"Good Morning, Russia!\".\n\nSeptember 8, 1998 \"RTR-1\" again changed its name to \"RTR\", changed the logo. At that time there were many Latin American television series production and a lot of new TV shows: Two piano Household chores, Schedule, Purple haze, 50x50, Hakuna matata-.\n\nIn 1999, the channel was disbanded edition sports \"Arena\" and instead was established sports studio, headed by [[Vladimir Gomelsky]].  The daily \"Vesti\" began to be broadcast at 13:00, 17:00, 19:00, 21:00, 23:00.\n\nUp to 1999, the national channel was plagued by broadcasting problems resulting from its dependence on its local state affiliates (GTRKs) for retransmission of its signal. GTRKs had no incentive to consistently broadcast only federal programming on their local frequencies and would often mix in programming they had produced themselves or acquired from other sources, thus hampering the national channel\u2019s ability to control its own programming schedule at the regional level. The first step leading to the solution of this problem was the creation of the state holding company VGTRK, which united 89 state-owned regional studios under the aegis of the Moscow-based Channel 2. In February 2004, the [[Russian government]] issued a [[Order of the Government of Russia|resolution]] on the reorganization of VGTRK through affiliation of subsidiaries, including regional GTRK companies. By the end of 2004, the scale of the reorganization became obvious. Local news programmes were organized on network principles and local companies turned into \"re-transmitters\" of the Moscow-produced content: VGTRK management had decided to cut all types of broadcasting in the regions, except news. This decision caused an inevitable reduction of GTRK broadcasting volume from 900 - 1,200 to 590 hours, the closure of whole subdivisions and departments and the dismissal of hundreds of employees in each of the 89 companies.\n\n==Viewership==\nIn 2013, Russia-1 was estimated to have 117 million daily viewers.<ref name=\"Shiraev 2013 p. 195\">{{cite book | last=Shiraev | first=E. | title=Russian Government and Politics | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | series=Comparative Government and Politics | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-137-26960-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SgdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA195 | accessdate=March 7, 2015 | page=195}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nOn 23 May 2015, Russia-1 aired ''Warsaw Pact: Declassified Pages'', a documentary that presented the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]] as protection against a NATO coup.<ref name=BBC150601>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32959054 |title=Russian TV doc on 1968 invasion angers Czechs and Slovaks |work= BBC News |date= 1 June 2015 }}</ref><ref name=RFE150601>{{cite news |url= http://www.rferl.org/content/russian-documentary-on-helpful-1968-invasion-angers-czechs/27047867.html |title=Russian Documentary On 'Helpful' 1968 Invasion Angers Czechs |work= [[Radio Free Europe]] |date= 1 June 2015 }}</ref><ref name=BB150601>{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-01/slovaks-condemn-russian-documentary-on-1968-warsaw-pact-invasion |title=Russian 1968 Prague Spring Invasion Film Angers Czechs, Slovaks |first= Ladka |last= Mortkowitz Bauerova |first2= Lenka |last2= Ponikelska |work= bloomberg.com |date= 1 June 2015 }}</ref> Slovakia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the film \"attempts to rewrite history and to falsify historical truths about such a dark chapter of our history.\"<ref name=SMFA150531>{{cite news |url= http://www.mzv.sk/servlet/content?MT=/App/WCM/main.nsf/vw_ByID/ID_C0B1D004B5A332B2C1257627003301E7_EN&OpenDocument=Y&LANG=EN&TG=BlankMaster&URL=/App/WCM/Aktualit.nsf/%28vw_ByID%29/ID_4E6407DFBF0FFE00C1257E570023F671 |title= Statement of the Speaker of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic on the documentary film of the Russian television about the 1968 invasion |publisher= Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic |date= 31 May 2015 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150925213521/http://www.mzv.sk/servlet/content?MT=%2FApp%2FWCM%2Fmain.nsf%2Fvw_ByID%2FID_C0B1D004B5A332B2C1257627003301E7_EN&OpenDocument=Y&LANG=EN&TG=BlankMaster&URL=%2FApp%2FWCM%2FAktualit.nsf%2F%28vw_ByID%29%2FID_4E6407DFBF0FFE00C1257E570023F671 |archivedate= 25 September 2015 }}</ref> Czech Foreign Minister [[Lubom\u00edr Zaor\u00e1lek]] said that it \"grossly distorts\" the facts.<ref name=BB150601/><ref name=CMFA150601>{{cite news |url= http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/udalosti_a_media/tiskove_zpravy/x2015_06_01_ministr_zaoralek_si_predvolal.html |title=Ministr Zaor\u00e1lek si p\u0159edvolal velvyslance Rusk\u00e9 federace |language= Czech |work= Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic |date= 1 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn Russia, the station is criticized for strong pro-government bias.

By 1987, it was also the first channel to adopt sign language interpretation in the USSR and later supplemented by subtitles for the hard of hearing, all for its Vremya broadcast.\n\nThe official identification package for the channel was the star of the second antenna on a blue background with moving rings, symbolizing the radio waves, and the signature at the bottom of \"II program\", which then changed to \"TV USSR.\" Around February 1988, a new ident replaced it: circles were fixed, disappeared inscription \"TV USSR\", and the background was light blue with a white gradient.\n\nSince 1989, the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR) implemented the organization of the Russian national TV channel. By this time all the Union republics, with the exception of Russia, had their own TV channels. In 1990, the creator of the program \"The Fifth Wheel\", People's Deputy of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR Bella Kurkova requested the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of Russia, [[Boris Yeltsin]] to create a separate Russian television station for the RSFSR, due to the fact that the central television channels reflect the views of the federal authorities. At that time, the country experienced a confrontation between the union and republican authorities.<ref>\u0412\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0438\". \u041f\u0435\u0440\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0434\u0432\u0430\u0434\u0446\u0430\u0442\u044c \u043b\u0435\u0442\". \u0414\u043e\u043a\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0444\u0438\u043b\u044c\u043c, 2011.</ref>\n\nOn July 13, 1990 a decision of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] ended the national monopoly on radio and television broadcasting in the RSFSR, clearing the way for it to launch its own TV and radio stations. Prior to September 15, 1990, according to the decree, the Cabinet of Ministers of the RSFSR, Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR, and the CM Committee on the media, communications with public organizations, mass movements of citizens and public opinion research should address the issue of the ownership of the material-technical base of AUC2. On July 14, 1990 decree \u2116 107-1 of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the RSFSR officially established the [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company]]. Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the RSFSR Ivan Silaev helped acquire the building and the equipment for the future station.<ref>[http://rkn.gov.ru/mass-communications/reestr/media/?id=405802&page= \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f HD]</ref>\n\nThus, Russia-1 is the successor to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Second Channel (Soviet Union)|Second Channel]] launched in 1963. As of 2000, it is headed by [[Oleg Dobrodeyev]], who was a founder of the original [[NTV (Russia)|NTV]].<ref name=Bessudnov />\n\n===Russian Federation===\n\n====1990s====\nAfter 27 years, the All-Union State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company turned over the operations of AUC2 on March 6, 1991 to the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company, with Oleg Poptsov as its founding chairman. At the same time, the leadership of the company had been promised at least a 6-hour broadcast day as a national blocktimer for viewers within Russia, including a brand-new 20-minute newscast to be aired twice daily on the new channel. Due to the opposition views of the Republican team, the new management staff, led by the new GM for the soon to be re-branded Russian Television, Sergei Podgorbunsky, faced difficulties ranging from an inability to rent a studio in the telecentre \"Ostankino\" to failure to provide the promised before air time for new programs.<ref>[http://www.continent-tv.ru/continent-tv/news/3667165/ \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u00ab\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f HD\u00bb \u2014 \u043d\u0430 \u00ab\u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0422\u0412\u00bb \u0438 \u00ab\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u0440\u0442\u0435\u00bb! | \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0442\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0442 \u0422\u0412]</ref>\n\nAt the same time, there were problems with the recruitment of new employees, program presenters and staff for the new station. Many presenters left the Union STRC free from TV censorship. As a result, the station management started to brainstorm and conceptualize its programming from scratch, including news and current affairs. Thus, \"Vesti\", the news program of RTV, was born, with airing time being at 18:00 and 20:00, twice nightly on weekdays (The 2nd edition was to be aired before its simulcast of Vremya). Most of the staff of \"Vesti\" on \"Russian Television\" were former presenters and staff of Central Television program \"Television News Service\", their experience would help the new channel in its news services. Four studios - \"News\" for newscasts, \"Republic\" for current affairs, \"Lad\" for arts and culture and \"Artel\" for entertainment and lifestyle were created.<ref>[http://www.rsoc.ru/mass-communications/reestr/media/?id=405802&page= \u041e\u0444\u0438\u0446\u0438\u0430\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0440\u0435\u0433\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u0446\u0438\u044f \u0441\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u043b\u044c\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0430 \u043e \u0421\u041c\u0418 \u0442\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u00ab\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f HD\u00bb | \u0420\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c\u043d\u0430\u0434\u0437\u043e\u0440 \u0420\u0424]</ref>\n\nOn May 13, 1991 recently appointed to the post of deputy general manager of the State Television and Radio Valentin Lazutkin officially launched the brand new ARSTV Channel 2 with air times from 11.35 to 13.35, from 17.00 to 19.00 and from 21.45 to 23.45, weekdays and weekends, with AUC2 filling the rest of the schedule. It was given a new corporate logo and a new brand name: \"Russian Television\".\n\nAt 17.00 \"Vesti\" made its premiere telecast, with [[Svetlana Sorokina]] hosting. From this time on Russian Television aired programming not only from the All-Union State Television and Radio but also from the All-Russian State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company. Compared with \"[[Vremya]]\", \"Vesti\" became the acute, short, specific and operational newscast Russians watched, without any censorship or bias. In the first week of broadcasting, \"Good night, kids!\" And Odessa \"Gentleman show\" made their premiere telecasts. Two weeks later, \"RTR\" (\"Russian Television and Radio\") became the new name of the channel, and a new logo debuted.\n\nIn August 1991, RTR stopped broadcasting in Latvia and was replaced by LTV2 (now LTV7).\n\nDuring the August coup, on August 19, 1991 the Emergency Committee stopped the broadcast of RTR, and AUC2 officially returned in the evening slots, with its planned programs including the great ballet \"Swan Lake\". Unknown to the coup leaders, RTR secretly organized a broadcast to the United States and other countries, as well as all over the USSR, so that all Soviets saw a special edition of \"Vesti\" with the latest events in Moscow during the coup. Studio \"Vesti\" in the \"Ostankino\" Center was blocked by AUC2 management, the transfer was recorded on video tape to \"Shabolovke\" for emergency situations has been prepared by an OB van and outside mobile facilities that the young channel had. The Emergency Committee blocked RTR headquarters on Yamskov field. In less than a few days, RTR had Clandestine broadcasts nationwide till the coup had failed.  After the August Coup \"RTR\" by order of Valentin Lazutkin, its deputy GM for operations, officially resumed broadcasting this time from 19.00 to 00.00 (instead of 17.00 to 19.00 and 21.45 to 23.45).\n\nOn September 16, 1991 AUC2 ended its operations and RTR absorbed several of its staff and programs, therefore beginning the next day it began to broadcast from the very morning till late at midnight.  On 30 December 1991 the program \"Vesti\" began to appear three times a day, and from 20 January 1992 to four times a day. In 1993, the channel changed its logo 2 times.\n\nIn February 1992, on the basis of the frequencies of RTR in Ukraine, channel UT-2 (now 1 +1) was launched.\n\nDuring the political crisis of 1993 RTR aired interviews from the different sides of the spectrum, from politicians to ordinary people. During the shooting of the White House, the director of the channel had violated the order to conduct the bombing broadcast live on that point, as long as the line of fire to avoid civilian casualties among the citizens of Moscow. After the police pushed the townspeople, \"RTR\" started broadcasting \"CNN\". At that time the building was shelled, which housed the studio of \"Vesti\". In a hole punched in the building of a grenade launcher, armed men broke into the studios and began shelling the building on fire.\n\nThe director of the program \"Vesti\" Irina Vinogradova was able to save the footage. Technical Director Stanislav Bunevich able to carry TV broadcasts control of the country in building the All-Russian STRC on Yamskov field. Broadcasting channel was restored, \"RTR\" was the only television channel, remaining on the air and which showed the 1993 First Deputy Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Shumeyko \"Vesti\" were donated to the mantel clock. events. Broadcasting was done in a hurry equipped studio in the basement with the lights off. Later, in a building opposite were found maturation snipers. For coverage of \n\nShowing important events, \"Vesti\" become the most influential program on RTR.  In the same year, Yuri Rostov, [[Vladislav Flyarkovsky]] and Alexander Gurnov started their jobs as field reporters for the channel under then head of news programming Alexander Nekhoroshev.\n\nSince 1994, the program began to leave a comment, \"Details\", which became a leading political commentator [[Nikolai Svanidze]] news. In October 1995, the RTR with ORT program went \"Ivanov, Petrov, Sidorov.\"\n\nIn 1996 Oleg Poptsov, Anatoly Lysenko, Alexander and Alexander Podgorbunsky Nekhoroshev were relieved of their posts, and Details was pulled off. The new chairman of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Company [[Eduard Sagalaev]] was appointed, and Cyril Legat chosen as the new GM for television, editor in chief of information programs of Russian Television Boris Forgetful. The channel will have emerged a number of new programs - information-analytical program \"Mirror\", which became a leading Nikolai Svanidze, the actual interview \"VIP\", talk show \"Open News\", which became the leading Edward Sagalaev, Svetlana Sorokina and Oksana Naychuk a manufacturer of private television ATV.\n\nIn 1997, the chairman of the All-Russia State Television and Radio Company was Nikolai Svanidze. Programs \"VIP\" and \"Open News\" were closed, she was dismissed leading \"Vesti\" Svetlana Sorokina. On November of that year, \"RTR\" changed to \"RTR-1\" has changed the logo. The reason for the name change - the creation of a new TV channel \"RTR-2\" (now \"Russia-Culture\").\n\nOn May 8, 1998 in the RTR includes regional television and radio. Since then, \"RTR\" broadcasts in 54 languages of the peoples of Russia, RTR became the largest media group in Europe. The general is not only the design of the channel, but the editorial policy. On 7 September of that year, on the air for the first time block out the morning program \"Good Morning, Russia!\".\n\nSeptember 8, 1998 \"RTR-1\" again changed its name to \"RTR\", changed the logo. At that time there were many Latin American television series production and a lot of new TV shows: Two piano Household chores, Schedule, Purple haze, 50x50, Hakuna matata-.\n\nIn 1999, the channel was disbanded edition sports \"Arena\" and instead was established sports studio, headed by [[Vladimir Gomelsky]].  The daily \"Vesti\" began to be broadcast at 13:00, 17:00, 19:00, 21:00, 23:00.\n\nUp to 1999, the national channel was plagued by broadcasting problems resulting from its dependence on its local state affiliates (GTRKs) for retransmission of its signal. GTRKs had no incentive to consistently broadcast only federal programming on their local frequencies and would often mix in programming they had produced themselves or acquired from other sources, thus hampering the national channel\u2019s ability to control its own programming schedule at the regional level. The first step leading to the solution of this problem was the creation of the state holding company VGTRK, which united 89 state-owned regional studios under the aegis of the Moscow-based Channel 2. In February 2004, the [[Russian government]] issued a [[Order of the Government of Russia|resolution]] on the reorganization of VGTRK through affiliation of subsidiaries, including regional GTRK companies. By the end of 2004, the scale of the reorganization became obvious. Local news programmes were organized on network principles and local companies turned into \"re-transmitters\" of the Moscow-produced content: VGTRK management had decided to cut all types of broadcasting in the regions, except news. This decision caused an inevitable reduction of GTRK broadcasting volume from 900 - 1,200 to 590 hours, the closure of whole subdivisions and departments and the dismissal of hundreds of employees in each of the 89 companies.\n\n==Viewership==\nIn 2013, Russia-1 was estimated to have 117 million daily viewers.<ref name=\"Shiraev 2013 p. 195\">{{cite book | last=Shiraev | first=E. | title=Russian Government and Politics | publisher=Palgrave Macmillan | series=Comparative Government and Politics | year=2013 | isbn=978-1-137-26960-7 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2SgdBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA195 | accessdate=March 7, 2015 | page=195}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nOn 23 May 2015, Russia-1 aired ''Warsaw Pact: Declassified Pages'', a documentary that presented the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia]] as protection against a NATO coup.<ref name=BBC150601>{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-32959054 |title=Russian TV doc on 1968 invasion angers Czechs and Slovaks |work= BBC News |date= 1 June 2015 }}</ref><ref name=RFE150601>{{cite news |url= http://www.rferl.org/content/russian-documentary-on-helpful-1968-invasion-angers-czechs/27047867.html |title=Russian Documentary On 'Helpful' 1968 Invasion Angers Czechs |work= [[Radio Free Europe]] |date= 1 June 2015 }}</ref><ref name=BB150601>{{cite news |url= https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-01/slovaks-condemn-russian-documentary-on-1968-warsaw-pact-invasion |title=Russian 1968 Prague Spring Invasion Film Angers Czechs, Slovaks |first= Ladka |last= Mortkowitz Bauerova |first2= Lenka |last2= Ponikelska |work= bloomberg.com |date= 1 June 2015 }}</ref> Slovakia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the film \"attempts to rewrite history and to falsify historical truths about such a dark chapter of our history.\"<ref name=SMFA150531>{{cite news |url= http://www.mzv.sk/servlet/content?MT=/App/WCM/main.nsf/vw_ByID/ID_C0B1D004B5A332B2C1257627003301E7_EN&OpenDocument=Y&LANG=EN&TG=BlankMaster&URL=/App/WCM/Aktualit.nsf/%28vw_ByID%29/ID_4E6407DFBF0FFE00C1257E570023F671 |title= Statement of the Speaker of the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic on the documentary film of the Russian television about the 1968 invasion |publisher= Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs of the Slovak Republic |date= 31 May 2015 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20150925213521/http://www.mzv.sk/servlet/content?MT=%2FApp%2FWCM%2Fmain.nsf%2Fvw_ByID%2FID_C0B1D004B5A332B2C1257627003301E7_EN&OpenDocument=Y&LANG=EN&TG=BlankMaster&URL=%2FApp%2FWCM%2FAktualit.nsf%2F%28vw_ByID%29%2FID_4E6407DFBF0FFE00C1257E570023F671 |archivedate= 25 September 2015 }}</ref> Czech Foreign Minister [[Lubom\u00edr Zaor\u00e1lek]] said that it \"grossly distorts\" the facts.<ref name=BB150601/><ref name=CMFA150601>{{cite news |url= http://www.mzv.cz/jnp/cz/udalosti_a_media/tiskove_zpravy/x2015_06_01_ministr_zaoralek_si_predvolal.html |title=Ministr Zaor\u00e1lek si p\u0159edvolal velvyslance Rusk\u00e9 federace |language= Czech |work= Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Czech Republic |date= 1 June 2015 }}</ref>\n\nIn Russia, the station is criticized for strong pro-government bias.
