In 1855, he was appointed [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Shropshire.<ref name = Dod/> A year later, he was attached to [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville's]] mission to Moscow as British representative at the coronation of [[Alexander II of Russia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=159}}\n\n===Politics===\nIn 1859, Acton settled in England, at his country house, Aldenham, in [[Shropshire]]. He was returned to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that same year as member for the Irish [[Carlow Borough (UK Parliament constituency)|Borough of Carlow]] and became a devoted admirer and adherent of Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. However, Acton was not an active MP, and his parliamentary career came to an end after the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1865]], when he headed the Liberal ballot for [[Bridgnorth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgnorth]] near his Shropshire home. Acton defeated Conservative leader [[Henry Whitmore]], who successfully [[election petition|petitioned]] for a scrutiny of the ballots, and thus retained his own seat and Acton lost his new seat. After the [[Reform Act 1867]], Acton again contested Bridgnorth, this time reduced to a single seat, in [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868]] but to no avail.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nActon took a great interest in the United States, considering its [[Federal republic|federal]] structure the perfect guarantor of individual liberties. During the [[American Civil War]], his sympathies lay entirely with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], for their defence of [[States' Rights]] against a centralised government that he believed would, by what he thought to be all historical precedent, inevitably turn tyrannical. His notes to Gladstone on the subject helped sway many in the British government to sympathise with the [[Confederate States of America|South]]. After the South's surrender, he wrote to [[Robert E. Lee]] that \"I mourn for the stake which was lost at Richmond more deeply than I rejoice over that which was saved at Waterloo,\" adding that he \"deemed that you were fighting battles for our liberty, our progress, and our civilization.\"<ref>[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig3/acton-lee.html 4 Nov 1866, letter to Robert E.

(1962). ''The Acton/Newman Relations: The Dilemma of Christian Liberalism''. Fordham University Press.</ref> In 1862, he merged this periodical into the ''Home and Foreign Review''. His contributions at once gave evidence of his remarkable wealth of historical knowledge. Though a sincere Roman Catholic, his whole spirit as a historian was hostile to [[ultramontane]] pretensions, and his independence of thought and liberalism of view speedily brought him into conflict with the Roman Catholic hierarchy. As early as August 1862, Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman|Wiseman]] publicly censured the ''Review''; and when in 1864, after [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]]'s appeal at the Munich Congress for a less hostile attitude towards historical criticism, the pope issued a declaration that the opinions of Catholic writers were subject to the authority of the Roman congregations, Acton felt that there was only one way of reconciling his literary conscience with his ecclesiastical loyalty, and he stopped the publication of his monthly periodical. He continued, however, to contribute articles to the ''[[North British Review]]'', which, previously a Scottish [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church]] organ, had been acquired by friends in sympathy with him, and which for some years (until 1872, when it ceased publication) promoted the interests of a high-class Liberalism in both temporal and ecclesiastical matters. Acton also did a good deal of lecturing on historical subjects.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nIn the March 1862 ''Rambler'', Acton wrote: \"The Celts are not among the progressive, initiative races, but among those which supply the materials rather than the impulse of history, and are either stationary or retrogressive. The Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, and the [[Teutons]] are the only makers of history, the only authors of advancement. Other races possessing a highly developed language, a speculative religion, enjoying luxury and art, attain to a certain pitch of cultivation which they are unable to either communicate or to increase. They are a negative element in the world.\" And: \"Subjection to a people of a higher capacity for government is of itself no misfortune; and it is to most countries the condition of their political advancement.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31278|title=The History of Freedom, and Other Essays|first=John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton|last=Acton|date=15 February 2010|via=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Lord Acton's dictum|\"Lord Acton's dictum\"|Acton's dictum}}In 1870, along with his mentor [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]], Acton opposed the moves to promulgate the [[doctrine]] of [[papal infallibility]] in the [[First Vatican Council]], travelling to Rome to lobby against it, ultimately unsuccessfully.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tonsor | first1 = Stephen J | year = 1959 | title = Lord Acton on Dollinger's Historical Theology | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 329\u2013352 | doi=10.2307/2708113| jstor = 2708113 }}</ref> Unlike [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]] Acton did not become an [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]], and continued attending Mass regularly; he received the [[last rites]] on his deathbed.<ref>{{cite CE1913 |last=Thurston |first=Herbert |wstitle=John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton, Baron Acton |volume=1}}</ref>  The Catholic Church did not try to force his hand. It was in this context that, in a letter he wrote to scholar and ecclesiastic [[Mandell Creighton]], dated April 1887, Acton made his most famous pronouncement:\n\n<blockquote>But if we might discuss this point until we found that we nearly agreed, and if we do agree thoroughly about the impropriety of [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlylese]] denunciations and [[Pharisaism]] in history, I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men, with a favourable presumption that they did no wrong. If there is any presumption it is the other way, against the holders of power, increasing as the power increases. Historic responsibility has to make up for the want of legal responsibility. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority, still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of it. That is the point at which the negation of Catholicism and the negation of Liberalism meet and keep high festival, and the end learns to justify the means. You would hang a man of no position like [[Ravaillac]]; but if what one hears is true, then [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] asked the gaoler to murder [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]], and [[William III of England]] ordered his Scots minister to [[Massacre of Glencoe|extirpate a clan]]. Here are the greatest names coupled with the greatest crimes; you would spare those criminals, for some mysterious reason. I would hang them higher than [[Haman]], for reasons of quite obvious justice, still more, still higher for the sake of historical science.<ref name=\"lmcone\"/></blockquote>\n\nThenceforth he steered clear of theological [[polemics]]. He devoted himself to reading, study and congenial society. With all his capacity for study, he was a man of the world and a man of affairs, not a bookworm.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}} His only notable publications were a masterly essay in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' of January 1878 on \"Democracy in Europe;\" two lectures delivered at Bridgnorth in 1877 on \"The History of Freedom in Antiquity\" and \"The History of Freedom in Christianity\"\u2014these last the only tangible portions put together by him of his long-projected \"History of Liberty;\" and an essay on modern German historians in the first number of the ''[[English Historical Review]]'', which he helped to found (1886). After 1879 he divided his time between London, [[Cannes]], and [[Tegernsee]] in Bavaria, enjoying and reciprocating the society of his friends. In 1872 he had been given the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the [[University of Munich]]; in 1888 Cambridge gave him the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Laws]], and in 1889 Oxford the [[Doctor of Civil Law]]; and in 1890 he received the high academic accolade of being made a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nIn 1874, when Gladstone published his pamphlet on ''[[The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance]]'', Lord Acton wrote during November and December a series of remarkable letters to ''[[The Times]]'', illustrating Gladstone's main theme by numerous historical examples of papal inconsistency, in a way which must have been bitter enough to the ultramontane party, but ultimately disagreeing with Gladstone's conclusion and insisting that the Church itself was better than its premises implied. Acton's letters led to another storm in the English Roman Catholic world, but once more it was considered prudent by the [[Holy See]] to leave him alone. In spite of his reservations, he regarded \"communion with Rome as dearer than life\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1865 Acton married Countess Marie Anna Ludomilla Euphrosina von Arco auf Valley (1841-1923), daughter of the Bavarian Count Maximilian von Arco auf Valley, with whom he had six children:<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p145.htm#i1445 John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton of Aldenham] at thepeerage.com</ref>\n\n# Hon.

Gladstone found him a valuable political adviser, and in 1892, when the Liberal government came in, Lord Acton was made a lord-in-waiting. Finally, in 1895, on the death of Sir [[John Robert Seeley|John Seeley]], Lord [[Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Rosebery]] appointed him to the [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professorship of Modern History]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref name=Gronbacher /> He delivered two courses of lectures on the [[French Revolution]] and on Modern History, but it was in private that the effects of his teaching were felt most. The ''Cambridge Modern History'', though he did not live to see it, was planned under his editorship.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\nActon health began to fail in 1901, and on 19 June 1902, in his 69th year, he died at the [[spa]] town of [[Tegernsee]], [[Bavaria]], [[German Empire|Germany]], whilst staying at his wife's family home there. His body was buried in a small communal graveyard by [[Lake Tegernsee]], the grave lying today unmarked having lost its headstone in the latter half of the 20th century.<ref>'Lord Acton', by Roland Hill (Pub. Yale University Press, 2000)</ref> He was succeeded in the title by his son, [[Richard Lyon-Dalberg-Acton, 2nd Baron Acton]]. His 60,000-volume library, formed for use and not for display and composed largely of books full of his own annotations, was bought prior to his death by [[Andrew Carnegie]] in secret in order to secure the library for Acton's use during his lifetime, then upon Lord Acton's death, presented to [[John Morley]], who forthwith gave it to the University of Cambridge.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}{{sfn|\"Autobiography of Andrew and The Gospel of Wealth\"|2006|p=166}}\nAccording to [[Hugh Chisholm]], editor of the 1911 ''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'':\n{{quote|Lord Acton has left too little completed original work to rank among the great historians; his very learning seems to have stood in his way; he knew too much and his literary conscience was too acute for him to write easily, and his copiousness of information overloads his literary style.

The estates had previously been held by another English branch of the Acton family. John Acton's grandfather was a member of a younger line of the family which had transferred itself to [[France]] and, subsequently, to [[Italy]], but, subsequent to the extinction of the elder branch, he became the patriarch of the family.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=159}}<ref name=Chambers/>\n\nHis grandfather's eldest son, Richard, who was his father, married Marie Louise Pelline, the only daughter and heiress of [[Emmerich Joseph, 1st Duc de Dalberg]], who was a naturalised French noble of ancient German lineage who had entered the French service under [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and represented [[Louis XVIII of France|Louis XVIII]] at the [[Congress of Vienna]] in 1814. Subsequent to Sir Richard Acton's death in 1837, she became the wife of the [[Granville George Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|2nd Earl Granville]] (1840).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=159}}<ref name = Dod>{{cite book | last = Dod | first = Robert P. | title = The Peerage, Baronetage and Knightage of Great Britain and Ireland | year = 1860 | publisher = Whitaker and Co. | location = London | page = 83 }}</ref> Marie Louise Pelline de Dalberg was heiress of [[Worms, Germany|Herrnsheim]] in Germany.

He then studied privately at [[Edinburgh]]. He was denied entry to the [[University of Cambridge]] because he was a Catholic,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=159}} and subsequently went to [[Munich]] where he studied at the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich|University]] and resided in the house of [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger]], the theologian and forerunner of the [[Old Catholic Church]], with whom he became lifelong friends.<ref name=Gronbacher /> D\u00f6llinger inspired in him a deep love of historical research and a profound conception of its functions as a critical instrument in the study of sociopolitical liberty.<ref name=Gronbacher>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Gronbacher |first=Gregory |authorlink=  |editor-first=Ronald |editor-last=Hamowy |editor-link=Ronald Hamowy |encyclopedia=The Encyclopedia of Libertarianism |chapter=Acton, Lord (1834\u20131902) |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=yxNgXs3TkJYC |year=2008 |publisher= [[SAGE Publications|SAGE]]; [[Cato Institute]] |location= Thousand Oaks, CA |doi=10.4135/9781412965811.n3 |isbn= 978-1412965804 |oclc=750831024| lccn = 2008009151 |pages=4\u20135 |quote= |ref= }}</ref>\n\nHe was a master of the principal foreign languages, and began at an early age to collect a magnificent historical library, which he intended to use to compose a \"History of Liberty\". In politics, he was always an ardent [[The Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=159}}\n\n==Career==\n[[File:John Acton, 1st Baron Acton by Franz Seraph von Lenbach.jpg|upright|left|thumb|230px|Portrait of John Acton by [[Franz von Lenbach|Franz Seraph von Lenbach]], circa 1879.]]\nThrough extensive travels, Acton spent much time in the chief intellectual centres reading the actual correspondence of historical personalities.<ref name=Gronbacher /> Among his friends were [[Charles Forbes Ren\u00e9 de Montalembert|Montalembert]], [[Alexis de Tocqueville|Tocqueville]], [[Fustel de Coulanges]], [[Bluntschli]], [[Heinrich von Sybel|von Sybel]] and [[Leopold von Ranke|Ranke]]. In 1855, he was appointed [[Deputy Lieutenant]] of Shropshire.<ref name = Dod/> A year later, he was attached to [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Lord Granville's]] mission to Moscow as British representative at the coronation of [[Alexander II of Russia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=159}}\n\n===Politics===\nIn 1859, Acton settled in England, at his country house, Aldenham, in [[Shropshire]]. He was returned to the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] that same year as member for the Irish [[Carlow Borough (UK Parliament constituency)|Borough of Carlow]] and became a devoted admirer and adherent of Prime Minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]. However, Acton was not an active MP, and his parliamentary career came to an end after the [[1865 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1865]], when he headed the Liberal ballot for [[Bridgnorth (UK Parliament constituency)|Bridgnorth]] near his Shropshire home. Acton defeated Conservative leader [[Henry Whitmore]], who successfully [[election petition|petitioned]] for a scrutiny of the ballots, and thus retained his own seat and Acton lost his new seat. After the [[Reform Act 1867]], Acton again contested Bridgnorth, this time reduced to a single seat, in [[1868 United Kingdom general election|1868]] but to no avail.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nActon took a great interest in the United States, considering its [[Federal republic|federal]] structure the perfect guarantor of individual liberties. During the [[American Civil War]], his sympathies lay entirely with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], for their defence of [[States' Rights]] against a centralised government that he believed would, by what he thought to be all historical precedent, inevitably turn tyrannical. His notes to Gladstone on the subject helped sway many in the British government to sympathise with the [[Confederate States of America|South]]. After the South's surrender, he wrote to [[Robert E. Lee]] that \"I mourn for the stake which was lost at Richmond more deeply than I rejoice over that which was saved at Waterloo,\" adding that he \"deemed that you were fighting battles for our liberty, our progress, and our civilization.\"<ref>[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/orig3/acton-lee.html 4 Nov 1866, letter to Robert E.

(1962). ''The Acton/Newman Relations: The Dilemma of Christian Liberalism''. Fordham University Press.</ref> In 1862, he merged this periodical into the ''Home and Foreign Review''. His contributions at once gave evidence of his remarkable wealth of historical knowledge. Though a sincere Roman Catholic, his whole spirit as a historian was hostile to [[ultramontane]] pretensions, and his independence of thought and liberalism of view speedily brought him into conflict with the Roman Catholic hierarchy. As early as August 1862, Cardinal [[Nicholas Wiseman|Wiseman]] publicly censured the ''Review''; and when in 1864, after [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]]'s appeal at the Munich Congress for a less hostile attitude towards historical criticism, the pope issued a declaration that the opinions of Catholic writers were subject to the authority of the Roman congregations, Acton felt that there was only one way of reconciling his literary conscience with his ecclesiastical loyalty, and he stopped the publication of his monthly periodical. He continued, however, to contribute articles to the ''[[North British Review]]'', which, previously a Scottish [[Free Church of Scotland (1843\u20131900)|Free Church]] organ, had been acquired by friends in sympathy with him, and which for some years (until 1872, when it ceased publication) promoted the interests of a high-class Liberalism in both temporal and ecclesiastical matters. Acton also did a good deal of lecturing on historical subjects.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nIn the March 1862 ''Rambler'', Acton wrote: \"The Celts are not among the progressive, initiative races, but among those which supply the materials rather than the impulse of history, and are either stationary or retrogressive. The Persians, the Greeks, the Romans, and the [[Teutons]] are the only makers of history, the only authors of advancement. Other races possessing a highly developed language, a speculative religion, enjoying luxury and art, attain to a certain pitch of cultivation which they are unable to either communicate or to increase. They are a negative element in the world.\" And: \"Subjection to a people of a higher capacity for government is of itself no misfortune; and it is to most countries the condition of their political advancement.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/31278|title=The History of Freedom, and Other Essays|first=John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton|last=Acton|date=15 February 2010|via=Project Gutenberg}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Lord Acton's dictum|\"Lord Acton's dictum\"|Acton's dictum}}In 1870, along with his mentor [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]], Acton opposed the moves to promulgate the [[doctrine]] of [[papal infallibility]] in the [[First Vatican Council]], travelling to Rome to lobby against it, ultimately unsuccessfully.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tonsor | first1 = Stephen J | year = 1959 | title = Lord Acton on Dollinger's Historical Theology | url = | journal = Journal of the History of Ideas | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 329\u2013352 | doi=10.2307/2708113| jstor = 2708113 }}</ref> Unlike [[Johann Joseph Ignaz von D\u00f6llinger|D\u00f6llinger]] Acton did not become an [[Old Catholic Church|Old Catholic]], and continued attending Mass regularly; he received the [[last rites]] on his deathbed.<ref>{{cite CE1913 |last=Thurston |first=Herbert |wstitle=John Emerich Edward Dalberg Acton, Baron Acton |volume=1}}</ref>  The Catholic Church did not try to force his hand. It was in this context that, in a letter he wrote to scholar and ecclesiastic [[Mandell Creighton]], dated April 1887, Acton made his most famous pronouncement:\n\n<blockquote>But if we might discuss this point until we found that we nearly agreed, and if we do agree thoroughly about the impropriety of [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlylese]] denunciations and [[Pharisaism]] in history, I cannot accept your canon that we are to judge Pope and King unlike other men, with a favourable presumption that they did no wrong. If there is any presumption it is the other way, against the holders of power, increasing as the power increases. Historic responsibility has to make up for the want of legal responsibility. Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Great men are almost always bad men, even when they exercise influence and not authority, still more when you superadd the tendency or the certainty of corruption by authority. There is no worse heresy than that the office sanctifies the holder of it. That is the point at which the negation of Catholicism and the negation of Liberalism meet and keep high festival, and the end learns to justify the means. You would hang a man of no position like [[Ravaillac]]; but if what one hears is true, then [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth]] asked the gaoler to murder [[Mary, Queen of Scots|Mary]], and [[William III of England]] ordered his Scots minister to [[Massacre of Glencoe|extirpate a clan]]. Here are the greatest names coupled with the greatest crimes; you would spare those criminals, for some mysterious reason. I would hang them higher than [[Haman]], for reasons of quite obvious justice, still more, still higher for the sake of historical science.<ref name=\"lmcone\"/></blockquote>\n\nThenceforth he steered clear of theological [[polemics]]. He devoted himself to reading, study and congenial society. With all his capacity for study, he was a man of the world and a man of affairs, not a bookworm.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}} His only notable publications were a masterly essay in the ''[[Quarterly Review]]'' of January 1878 on \"Democracy in Europe;\" two lectures delivered at Bridgnorth in 1877 on \"The History of Freedom in Antiquity\" and \"The History of Freedom in Christianity\"\u2014these last the only tangible portions put together by him of his long-projected \"History of Liberty;\" and an essay on modern German historians in the first number of the ''[[English Historical Review]]'', which he helped to found (1886). After 1879 he divided his time between London, [[Cannes]], and [[Tegernsee]] in Bavaria, enjoying and reciprocating the society of his friends. In 1872 he had been given the honorary degree of Doctor of Philosophy by the [[University of Munich]]; in 1888 Cambridge gave him the honorary degree of [[Doctor of Laws]], and in 1889 Oxford the [[Doctor of Civil Law]]; and in 1890 he received the high academic accolade of being made a fellow of [[All Souls College, Oxford]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\nIn 1874, when Gladstone published his pamphlet on ''[[The Vatican Decrees in their Bearing on Civil Allegiance]]'', Lord Acton wrote during November and December a series of remarkable letters to ''[[The Times]]'', illustrating Gladstone's main theme by numerous historical examples of papal inconsistency, in a way which must have been bitter enough to the ultramontane party, but ultimately disagreeing with Gladstone's conclusion and insisting that the Church itself was better than its premises implied. Acton's letters led to another storm in the English Roman Catholic world, but once more it was considered prudent by the [[Holy See]] to leave him alone. In spite of his reservations, he regarded \"communion with Rome as dearer than life\".{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1865 Acton married Countess Marie Anna Ludomilla Euphrosina von Arco auf Valley (1841-1923), daughter of the Bavarian Count Maximilian von Arco auf Valley, with whom he had six children:<ref>[http://www.thepeerage.com/p145.htm#i1445 John Emerich Edward Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton of Aldenham] at thepeerage.com</ref>\n\n# Hon.

Gladstone found him a valuable political adviser, and in 1892, when the Liberal government came in, Lord Acton was made a lord-in-waiting. Finally, in 1895, on the death of Sir [[John Robert Seeley|John Seeley]], Lord [[Archibald Philip Primrose, 5th Earl of Rosebery|Rosebery]] appointed him to the [[Regius Professor of Modern History (Cambridge)|Regius Professorship of Modern History]] at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].<ref name=Gronbacher /> He delivered two courses of lectures on the [[French Revolution]] and on Modern History, but it was in private that the effects of his teaching were felt most. The ''Cambridge Modern History'', though he did not live to see it, was planned under his editorship.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=160}}\n\n==Death and legacy==\nActon health began to fail in 1901, and on 19 June 1902, in his 69th year, he died at the [[spa]] town of [[Tegernsee]], [[Bavaria]], [[German Empire|Germany]], whilst staying at his wife's family home there. His body was buried in a small communal graveyard by [[Lake Tegernsee]], the grave lying today unmarked having lost its headstone in the latter half of the 20th century.<ref>'Lord Acton', by Roland Hill (Pub.

His first credited part was in ''[[D.O.A. (1950 film)|D.O.A.]]'' (1950) as a henchman named Chester. His hulking physique, rough-hewn, craggy-faced looks and gravelly voice led to him largely playing gangsters, Western outlaws and other screen \"heavies\", cops and other tough-guy roles throughout his career.\n\nBrand was uncredited in ''[[My Foolish Heart (film)|My Foolish Heart]]'' (1949), ''[[Where the Sidewalk Ends (film)|Where the Sidewalk Ends]]'' (1950), and ''[[Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (film)|Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye]]'' (1950) but had a good role in TV in ''[[The Bigelow Theatre]]''.\n\nBrand's parts slowly grew bigger: ''[[Halls of Montezuma (film)|Halls of Montezuma]]'' (1951), ''[[Only the Valiant (film)|Only the Valiant]]'' (1951), ''[[The Mob (film)|The Mob]]'' (1951), and ''[[Red Mountain (film)|Red Mountain]]'' (1951).\n\nOn TV he did a short, ''[[Benjy]]'' (1951), and episodes of ''[[The Unexpected (TV series)|The Unexpected]]'' and ''[[Your Favorite Story]]''.

Though not the big-budget romp that the later Paul Newman\u2013Robert Redford film was, both Brand's Cassidy and Hale's Kid were played as likable outlaws, a rare change from Brand's typecasting as a murderous psycho. He followed it with ''[[Gun Brothers]]'' (1956).\n\nBrand became well known as a villain when he killed the character played by [[Elvis Presley]] in ''[[Love Me Tender (1956 film)|Love Me Tender]]'' (1956).

The characterization\u2014including in the television series pilot episode an odd broken-English pseudo-Italian accent which the American-born Capone did not have in real life - caused an outcry from the [[Italian American]] community over [[stereotype]]s. He played Capone twice on the show, in the pilot and in the double episode \"The Big Train\".\n\nBrand was in ''[[Five Gates to Hell]]'' (1959), ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960 film)|The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1960), ''[[The Last Sunset (film)|The Last Sunset]]'' (1961), and ''[[The George Raft Story]]'' (1961), reprising his role as Al Capone in the latter.<ref>Gordon Kay Slates Huffaker 'Posse': ''Los Angeles Times'' 12 May 1960: C9.</ref>\n\nHe guest starred on ''[[Straightaway]]'', ''[[Cain's Hundred]]'', ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'', ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The DuPont Show of the Week]]'', ''[[Ben Casey]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', ''[[The Lieutenant]]'', ''[[Theatre of Stars]]'', ''[[Arrest and Trial (TV series)|Arrest and Trial]]'', ''[[Destry (TV series)|Destry]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[Suspense (TV series)|Suspense]]'', ''[[Combat!]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.\n\nHe also portrayed a prison guard of ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'', was second billed in ''[[Hero's Island]]'' (1962) and had a key role in ''[[That Darn Cat!]]'' (1965).\n\nBrand co-starred with [[George Takei]] in \"[[The Encounter (Twilight Zone)|The Encounter]]\", an episode of the original ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' series.

His first credited part was in ''[[D.O.A. (1950 film)|D.O.A.]]'' (1950) as a henchman named Chester. His hulking physique, rough-hewn, craggy-faced looks and gravelly voice led to him largely playing gangsters, Western outlaws and other screen \"heavies\", cops and other tough-guy roles throughout his career.\n\nBrand was uncredited in ''[[My Foolish Heart (film)|My Foolish Heart]]'' (1949), ''[[Where the Sidewalk Ends (film)|Where the Sidewalk Ends]]'' (1950), and ''[[Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye (film)|Kiss Tomorrow Goodbye]]'' (1950) but had a good role in TV in ''[[The Bigelow Theatre]]''.\n\nBrand's parts slowly grew bigger: ''[[Halls of Montezuma (film)|Halls of Montezuma]]'' (1951), ''[[Only the Valiant (film)|Only the Valiant]]'' (1951), ''[[The Mob (film)|The Mob]]'' (1951), and ''[[Red Mountain (film)|Red Mountain]]'' (1951).\n\nOn TV he did a short, ''[[Benjy]]'' (1951), and episodes of ''[[The Unexpected (TV series)|The Unexpected]]'' and ''[[Your Favorite Story]]''. He was in ''[[Kansas City Confidential]]'' (1952), ''[[The Turning Point (1952 film)|The Turning Point]]'' (1952), and, notably, ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953).<ref>Neville Brand Signed for 'Kansas City 117' ''Los Angeles Times'' 8 June 1952: E3. \n</ref>\n\nBrand was now much in demand as a support actor, appearing in ''[[The Charge at Feather River]]'' (1953), ''[[The Man from the Alamo]]'' (1953), and ''[[Gun Fury]]'' (1953).\n\n===Leading man===\nBrand moved up to leading roles with ''[[Man Crazy (1953 film)|Man Crazy]]'' (1953) and then ''[[Riot in Cell Block 11]]'' (1954). He was down the cast list for ''[[The Lone Gun]]'' (1954) but had the lead in ''[[Return from the Sea]]'' (1954).<ref>Sperling Aims Yordan Tale at Brando; Neville Brand Again Will Star\nSchallert, Edwin. ''Los Angeles Times'' 15 Sep 1953: B7.</ref>\n\nBrand had a support role in ''[[The Prodigal]]'' (1955) and ''[[The Return of Jack Slade]]'' and guest roles in ''[[Appointment with Adventure]]'', ''[[Screen Directors Playhouse]]'', ''[[Studio One in Hollywood]]'', ''[[Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre]]'', ''[[Chevron Hall of Stars]]'', ''[[Schlitz Playhouse]]'', ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]'', and ''[[Stage 7]]''.\n\nHe had lead roles in ''[[Bobby Ware Is Missing]]'' (1955) and ''[[Fury at Gunsight Pass]]'' (1956) and supported in ''[[Raw Edge]]'' (1956), and ''[[Mohawk (1956 film)|Mohawk]]'' (1956).\n\nHe had the distinction of being the first actor to portray outlaw [[Butch Cassidy]], in the film ''[[The Three Outlaws]]'' opposite [[Alan Hale Jr.]] as the [[Sundance Kid]]. Though not the big-budget romp that the later Paul Newman\u2013Robert Redford film was, both Brand's Cassidy and Hale's Kid were played as likable outlaws, a rare change from Brand's typecasting as a murderous psycho. He followed it with ''[[Gun Brothers]]'' (1956).\n\nBrand became well known as a villain when he killed the character played by [[Elvis Presley]] in ''[[Love Me Tender (1956 film)|Love Me Tender]]'' (1956).

The characterization\u2014including in the television series pilot episode an odd broken-English pseudo-Italian accent which the American-born Capone did not have in real life - caused an outcry from the [[Italian American]] community over [[stereotype]]s. He played Capone twice on the show, in the pilot and in the double episode \"The Big Train\".\n\nBrand was in ''[[Five Gates to Hell]]'' (1959), ''[[The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1960 film)|The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'' (1960), ''[[The Last Sunset (film)|The Last Sunset]]'' (1961), and ''[[The George Raft Story]]'' (1961), reprising his role as Al Capone in the latter.<ref>Gordon Kay Slates Huffaker 'Posse': ''Los Angeles Times'' 12 May 1960: C9.</ref>\n\nHe guest starred on ''[[Straightaway]]'', ''[[Cain's Hundred]]'', ''[[Death Valley Days]]'', ''[[The Joey Bishop Show (sitcom)|The Joey Bishop Show]]'', ''[[Naked City (TV series)|Naked City]]'', ''[[The DuPont Show of the Week]]'', ''[[Ben Casey]]'', ''[[Rawhide (TV series)|Rawhide]]'', ''[[The Lieutenant]]'', ''[[Theatre of Stars]]'', ''[[Arrest and Trial (TV series)|Arrest and Trial]]'', ''[[Destry (TV series)|Destry]]'', ''[[Wagon Train]]'', ''[[Suspense (TV series)|Suspense]]'', ''[[Combat!]]'', and ''[[Gunsmoke]]''.\n\nHe also portrayed a prison guard of ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'', was second billed in ''[[Hero's Island]]'' (1962) and had a key role in ''[[That Darn Cat!]]'' (1965).\n\nBrand co-starred with [[George Takei]] in \"[[The Encounter (Twilight Zone)|The Encounter]]\", an episode of the original ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' series. Brand, a genuine decorated veteran, portrays a phony war hero, a coward who obtained his prize trophy (a Japanese soldier's sword) by murdering a Japanese officer after he had surrendered.\n\n===''Laredo''===\nBrand was given the star role in a TV series, ''[[Laredo (TV series)|Laredo]]'' (1965\u201367) which ran for 56 episodes.<ref>Niche for Neville?

He played [[Hoss Cartwright]]'s ([[Dan Blocker]]) Swedish uncle Gunnar Borgstrom on ''[[Bonanza]]'' in the episode \"The Last Viking\".\n\nHe was in ''[[Longstreet (TV series)|Longstreet]]'', ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'', ''[[Adventures of Nick Carter]]'', ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', ''[[Two for the Money (1972 film)|Two for the Money]]'' (1972), ''[[No Place to Run (film)|No Place to Run]]'' (1972), ''[[The Police Connection]]'' (1972), ''[[This Is a Hijack]]'' (1973), ''[[Cahill U.S. Marshal]]'' (1973) with John Wayne, ''[[Scalawag (film)|Scalawag]]'' (1973), ''[[The Magician (U.S. TV series)|The Magician]]'', ''[[The Deadly Trackers]]'' (1973) with [[Richard Harris]], ''[[Killdozer!

F., & Jensen, M. C}}</ref>  There are often benefits to these relationships, usually because the agent has some expertise the principal does not have. However, this type of relationship also causes some problems for the principal. Since there is [[asymmetric information]], where the principal is not necessarily aware of what the agent is doing, [[moral hazard]] can exist: the agent can act in such a way that the agent's own interests are met, rather than those of the principal.<ref name=\"Fama\"/> This is called the [[principal-agent problem]] and is an important theory in [[economics]] and [[political science]].\n\nPrincipal-agent theory has suggested that some governance mechanisms can help align the interest of the principal with those of the agent. Steering and monitoring are key mechanisms to bring this about.<ref name=\"Fama\"/> Clear directives build awareness of expectations, and provide the principal with criteria to audit; similarly, some incentives, such as variable pay or bonus-malus systems, can help align the agent's interests with the principal's interest. Monitoring the agent also helps, but can come at high costs. Altogether, these governance mechanisms can help make the agent more accountable to the principal.<ref name=\"Fama\"/>\n\n==Multiple principals==\nThe simple principal-agent model involves only one agent, one principal, and one task, and is a simplification of reality. In organizations, relationships typically involve multiple actors, and in particular, multiple principals. The director of a firm acts on behalf of all shareholders, typically not on behalf of one. Once multiple principals are introduced, governance gets substantially harder, and so the principal-agent problem gets more serious.\n\nThe multiple principal problem occurs specifically when one agent acts on behalf of multiple principals. The principal-agent problem here is intensified: not only is there still asymmetric information between the principals and agent that can bring moral hazard, but there is also asymmetric information between the principals themselves that can lead to moral hazard between the principals.<ref name=\"Bernheim\">{{Cite journal|title = Common agency|journal = Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society|date = 1986|author = Bernheim, B. D., & Whinston, M. D.}}</ref> In particular, since principals' interests often diverge, they face incentives to advance their individual interests instead of the joint interests by all principals, in addition to the moral hazard problem that is still faced by the agent.<ref name=\"Bernheim\"/> As a result, introducing governance to align the interests of the principals with those of the agent is much more difficult.\n\n==Consequences==\nThe multiple principal problem can surface in many ways.<ref name=\"Voorn\"/> First, individual principals may lobby or bribe the agent to advance their interests in lieu of those of the other principals.<ref name=\"Bernheim\"/> Second, individual principals may free-ride in the steering or monotoring of the agent, leading to insufficient governance.<ref name=\"Gailmard\">{{Cite journal|title = Multiple principals and oversight of bureaucratic policy-making.|journal = Journal of Theoretical Politics|volume = 21|issue = 2|pages = 161\u2013186|date = 2009|doi = 10.1177/0951629808100762|author = Gailmard, S.}}</ref> Third, and alternatively principals may duplicate steering and monitoring that other agents have already pursued, leading to much higher costs of governance than necessary, again discouraging governance.<ref name=\"Khalil\">{{Cite journal|title = Monitoring a common agent: Implications for financial contracting.|journal = Journal of Economic Theory|volume = 135|pages = 35\u201367|date = 2007|doi = 10.1016/j.jet.2005.08.010|author = Khalil, F., Martimort, D., & Parigi, B.|url = http://publications.ut-capitole.fr/16142/1/martimort_khalil_parigi.pdf}}</ref> All of this can lead to conflict between principals and higher than usual autonomy for the agent, in turn causing even more asymmetric information between principals and agent and increasing the moral hazard risk of the agent.<ref name=\"Voorn\"/> This in turn leads to much inefficiency.<ref name=\"Bernheim\"/>\n\n==Examples==\nThe multiple principal problem is a serious problem in particularly the public sector, where democratic institutions make the presence of multiple principals common.

F., & Jensen, M. C}}</ref>  There are often benefits to these relationships, usually because the agent has some expertise the principal does not have. However, this type of relationship also causes some problems for the principal. Since there is [[asymmetric information]], where the principal is not necessarily aware of what the agent is doing, [[moral hazard]] can exist: the agent can act in such a way that the agent's own interests are met, rather than those of the principal.<ref name=\"Fama\"/> This is called the [[principal-agent problem]] and is an important theory in [[economics]] and [[political science]].\n\nPrincipal-agent theory has suggested that some governance mechanisms can help align the interest of the principal with those of the agent. Steering and monitoring are key mechanisms to bring this about.<ref name=\"Fama\"/> Clear directives build awareness of expectations, and provide the principal with criteria to audit; similarly, some incentives, such as variable pay or bonus-malus systems, can help align the agent's interests with the principal's interest. Monitoring the agent also helps, but can come at high costs. Altogether, these governance mechanisms can help make the agent more accountable to the principal.<ref name=\"Fama\"/>\n\n==Multiple principals==\nThe simple principal-agent model involves only one agent, one principal, and one task, and is a simplification of reality. In organizations, relationships typically involve multiple actors, and in particular, multiple principals. The director of a firm acts on behalf of all shareholders, typically not on behalf of one. Once multiple principals are introduced, governance gets substantially harder, and so the principal-agent problem gets more serious.\n\nThe multiple principal problem occurs specifically when one agent acts on behalf of multiple principals. The principal-agent problem here is intensified: not only is there still asymmetric information between the principals and agent that can bring moral hazard, but there is also asymmetric information between the principals themselves that can lead to moral hazard between the principals.<ref name=\"Bernheim\">{{Cite journal|title = Common agency|journal = Econometrica: Journal of the Econometric Society|date = 1986|author = Bernheim, B.

The Tudor period coincides with the dynasty of the [[House of Tudor]] in England whose first monarch was [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (b.1457, r.1485{{ndash}}1509). Historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] (1988) argued that \"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors\" than at any time in a hundred years.<ref>John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, p. 32</ref>\n\n==Population and economy==\nFollowing the [[Black Death]] and the agricultural depression of the late 15th century, the population began to increase. It was less than 2 million in 1600. The growing population stimulated economic growth, accelerated the commercialisation of agriculture, increased the production and export of wool, encouraged trade, and promoted the growth of London.<ref>David M. Palliser, ''The Age of Elizabeth: England under the later Tudors, 1547\u20131603'' p. 300.</ref>\n\nThe high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 15th century and early 16th century were replaced with low wages and a land shortage. Various inflationary pressures, perhaps due to an influx of New World gold and a rising population, set the stage for social upheaval with the gap between the rich and poor widening. This was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population, with [[manorial]] lords beginning the process of [[enclosure]] of village lands that previously had been open to everyone.<ref>Ian Dawson, ''The Tudor century'' (1993) p. 214</ref>\n\n==English Reformation==\n{{Main|English Reformation}}\nThe Reformation transformed English religion during the Tudor period. The five sovereigns, Henry VII, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I had entirely different approaches, with Henry VIII replacing the pope as the head of the Church of England but maintaining Catholic doctrines, Edward imposing a very strict Protestantism, Mary attempting to reinstate Catholicism, and Elizabeth arriving at a compromise position that defined the not-quite-Protestant Church of England. It began with the insistent demands of Henry VIII for an annulment of his marriage that [[Pope Clement VII]] refused to grant.<ref>Peter H. Marshall, ''Heretics and Believers: A History of the English Reformation'' (Yale UP, 2017).</ref>\n\nHistorians agreed that the great theme of Tudor history was the Reformation, the transformation of England from Catholicism to Protestantism. The main events, constitutional changes, and players at the national level have long been known, and the major controversies about them largely resolved. Historians until the late 20th century thought that the causes were: a widespread dissatisfaction or even disgust with the evils, corruptions, failures, and contradictions of the established religion, setting up an undertone of [[anti-clericalism]] that indicated a rightness for reform. A secondary influence was the intellectual impact of certain English reformers, such as the long-term impact of [[John Wycliffe]] (1328\u20131384) and his \u201c[[Lollardy]]\u201d reform movement, together with a stream of Reformation treatises and pamphlets from [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], and other reformers on the continent. The interpretation by [[Geoffrey Elton]] in 1960 is representative of the orthodox interpretation. He argued that:\n:The existing situation proved untenable because the laity feared, resented, and despised much about the Church, its officers, its courts and its wealth. ... A poverty-stricken and ignorant lower clergy, wealthy bishops and abbots, a wide ramification of jurisdiction, a mixture of high claims and low deeds did not make for respect or love among the laity.<ref>G. R. Elton, ''The Tudor Constitution: Documents and Commentary'' (1960) pp 318\u201319</ref>\n\nSocial historians after 1960 investigated English religion at the local level, and discovered the dissatisfaction had not been so widespread. The Lollardy movement had largely expired, and the pamphleteering of continental reformers hardly reached beyond a few scholars at the [[University of Cambridge]]\u2014King Henry VIII had vigorously and publicly denounced Luther's heresies. More important, the Catholic Church was in a strong condition in 1500. England was devoutly Catholic, it was loyal to the pope, local parishes attracted strong local financial support, religious services were quite popular both at Sunday Mass and at family devotions. Complaints about the monasteries and the bishops were uncommon. The kings backed the popes and by the time Luther appeared on the scene, England was among the strongest supporters of orthodox Catholicism, and seemed a most unlikely place for a religious revolution.<ref>Ronald H.

Henry engaged in a number of administrative, economic and diplomatic initiatives. He paid very close attention to detail and, instead of spending lavishly, concentrated on raising new revenues. His new taxes were unpopular, and when Henry VIII succeeded him, he executed Henry VII's two most hated tax collectors.<ref>Sydney Anglo, \"Ill of the dead: The posthumous reputation of Henry VII\", ''Renaissance Studies'' 1 (1987): 27\u201347.

In foreign-policy, he focused on fighting France\u2014with minimal success\u2014and had to deal with Scotland, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire, often with military mobilisation or actual highly expensive warfare that led to high taxes. The chief military success came over Scotland.<ref>E. W. Ives, \"Henry VIII (1491\u20131547)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2009) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12955, accessed 8 Aug 2017]</ref> The main policy development was Henry's taking full control of the Church of England. This followed from his break from Rome, which was caused by the refusal of the Pope to annul his original marriage. Henry thereby introduced a very mild variation of the Protestant Reformation. There were two main aspects. First Henry rejected the Pope as the head of the Church in England, insisting that national sovereignty required the Absolute supremacy of the king. Henry worked closely with Parliament in passing a series of laws that implemented the break. Englishmen could no longer appeal to Rome. All the decisions were to be made in England, ultimately by the King himself, and in practice by top aides such as Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell. Parliament proved highly supportive, with little dissent. The decisive moves came with the [[Acts of Supremacy|Act of Supremacy in 1534]] that made the king the protector and only supreme head of the church and clergy of England. After Henry imposed a heavy fine on the bishops, they nearly all complied. The laws of treason were greatly strengthened so that verbal dissent alone was treasonous. There were some short-lived popular rebellions that were quickly suppressed. The league level in terms of the aristocracy and the Church was supportive. The highly visible main refusals came from Bishop Fisher and Chancellor Thomas More; they were both executed. Among the senior aristocrats, trouble came from the Pole family, which supported [[Reginald Pole]] who was in exile in Europe. Henry destroyed the rest of the family, executing its leaders, and seizing all its property. The second stage involved the seizure of the monasteries. The monasteries operating religious and charitable institutions were closed, the monks and nuns were pensioned off, and the valuable lands were sold to friends of the King, thereby producing a large, wealthy, gentry class that supported Henry. In terms of theology and ritual there was little change, as Henry wanted to keep most elements of Catholicism and detested the \"heresies\" of Martin Luther and the other reformers.<ref>Richard Rex, ''Henry VIII and the English reformation'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2006).</ref>\n\n====Father of the Royal Navy====\nBiographer [[Jack Scarisbrick|J.J. Scarisbrick]] says that Henry deserved his traditional title of \"Father of the English navy.\"<ref>J.J. Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' (1968) pp 500\u20131.</ref> It became his personal weapon. He inherited seven small warships from his father, and added two dozen more by 1514. In addition to those built in England, he bought up Italian and Hanseatic warships. By March 1513, he proudly watched his fleet sail down the Thames under command of Sir Edmund Howard. It was the most powerful naval force to date in English history: 24 ships led by the 1600 ton \"Henry Imperial\"; the fleet carried 5000 combat marines and 3000 sailors. It forced the outnumbered French fleet back to its ports, took control of the English Channel, and blockaded Brest. Henry was the first king to organise the navy as a permanent force, with a permanent administrative and logistical structure, funded by tax revenue. His personal attention was concentrated on land, where he founded the royal dockyards, planted trees for shipbuilding, enacted laws for in land navigation, guarded the coastline with fortifications, set up a school for navigation and designated the roles of officers and sailors. He closely supervised the construction of all his warships and their guns, knowing their designs, speed, tonnage, armaments and battle tactics. He encouraged his naval architects, who perfected the Italian technique of mounting guns in the waist of the ship, thus lowering the centre of gravity and making it a better platform. He supervised the smallest details and enjoyed nothing more than presiding over the launching of a new ship.<ref>A.F. Pollard, ''Henry VIII'' (1902) pp 50, 100\u20132.</ref> He drained his treasury on military and naval affairs, diverting the revenues from new taxes and the sales of monastery lands.<ref>N.A.M.

It lacked a useful strategy. It did serve for defence against invasion, and for enhancing England's international prestige.<ref>G.R.

He was amazingly energetic and far-reaching. In terms of achievements, he built a great fortune for himself, and was a major benefactor of arts, humanities and education. He projected numerous reforms, but in the end English government had not changed much. For all the promise, there was very little achievement of note. From the king's perspective, his greatest failure was an inability to get a divorce when Henry VIII needed a new wife to give him a son who would be the undisputed heir to the throne. Historians agree that Wolsey was a disappointment. In the end, he conspired with Henry's enemies, and died of natural causes before he could be beheaded.<ref>S.T. Bindoff, ''Tudor England'' (1950), p 78</ref><ref>J.D. Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors 1485 \u2013 1558'' (1952), pp 286\u2013334.</ref>\n\n====Thomas Cromwell====\nHistorian Geoffrey Elton argued that [[Thomas Cromwell]], who was Henry VIII's [[List of English chief ministers|chief minister]] from 1532 to 1540, not only removed control of the Church of England from the hands of the Pope, but transformed England with an unprecedented modern, bureaucratic government.<ref>G.R. Elton, ''The Tudor Revolution in Government'' (1953).</ref> Cromwell (1485\u20131540)<ref>He was a distant relative of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599\u20131658) who ruled a century later.</ref> replaced medieval government-as-household-management. Cromwell introduced reforms into the administration that delineated the King's household from the state and created a modern administration. He injected Tudor power into the darker corners of the realm and radically altered the role of the [[Parliament of England]]. This transition happened in the 1530s, Elton argued, and must be regarded as part of a planned revolution. Elton's point was that before Cromwell the realm could be viewed as the King's private estate writ large, where most administration was done by the King's household servants rather than separate state offices. By masterminding these reforms, Cromwell laid the foundations of England's future stability and success. Cromwell's luck ran out when he picked [[Anne of Cleves|the wrong bride]] for the King; he was beheaded for treason, More recently historians have emphasised that the king and others played powerful roles as well.<ref>Christoper Coleman and David Starkey, eds., ''Revolution Reassessed: Revision in the History of Tudor Government and Administration'' (1986)</ref><ref>Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors 1485 \u2013 1558'' (1952), pp 413\u201317.</ref>\n\n====Dissolution of the Monasteries: 1536\u20131545====\n{{main|Dissolution of the Monasteries}}\nThe king had an annual income of about \u00a3100,000, but he needed much more in order to suppress rebellions and finance his foreign adventures. In 1533, for example, military expenditures on the northern border cost \u00a325,000, while the 1534 rebellion in Ireland cost \u00a338,000. Suppressing the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] cost \u00a350,000, and the king's new palaces were expensive. Meanwhile, customs revenue was slipping. The Church had an annual revenue of about \u00a3300,000; a new tax of 10% was imposed which brought in about \u00a330,000. To get even larger sums it was proposed to seize the lands owned by monasteries, some of which the monks farmed and most of which was leased to local gentry. Taking ownership meant the rents went to the king. Selling the land to the gentry at a bargain price brought in \u00a31 million in one-time revenue and gave the gentry a stake in the administration.<ref>Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors'', pp 370\u201379.</ref> The clerical payments from [[Annates|First Fruits and Tenths]], which previously went to the pope, now went to the king. Altogether, between 1536 and Henry's death, his government collected \u00a31.3 million; this huge influx of money caused Cromwell to change the Crown's financial system to manage the money. He created a new department of state and a new official to collect the proceeds of the dissolution and the First Fruits and Tenths. The [[Court of Augmentations]] and number of departments meant a growing number of officials, which made the management of revenue a major activity.<ref>{{cite book|author=John A.

How to pay for it remained a serious issue. The growing number of departments meant many new salaried bureaucrats. There were further financial and administrative difficulties in 1540\u201358, aggravated by war, debasement, corruption and inefficiency, which were mainly caused by Somerset. After Cromwell's fall, [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester]], the [[Lord High Treasurer|Lord Treasurer]], produced further reforms to simplify the arrangements, reforms which united most of the crown's finance under the exchequer. The courts of general surveyors and augmentations were fused into a new Court of Augmentations, and this was later absorbed into the exchequer along with the First Fruits and Tenths.<ref>{{cite book|author=John A.

There was little debt, and he left his son a large treasury. Henry VIII spent heavily on luxuries, such as tapestries and palaces, but his peacetime budget was generally satisfactory. The heavy strain came from warfare, including building defences, building a Navy, Suppressing insurrections, warring with Scotland, and engaging in very expensive continental warfare. Henry's Continental wars won him little glory or diplomatic influence, and no territory. Nevertheless, warfare 1511 to 1514 with three large expeditions and two smaller ones cost \u00a3912,000. The Boulogne campaign of 1544 cost \u00a31,342,000 and the wars against Scotland \u00a3954,000; the naval wars cost \u00a3149,000 and large sums were spent to build and maintain inland and coastal fortifications. The total cost of war and defence between 1539\u20131547 was well over \u00a32,000,000, although the accounting procedures were too primitive to give an accurate total. Adding it all up, approximately 35% came from taxes, 32% from selling land and monastery holdings, and 30% from debasing the coinage. The cost of war in the short reign of Edward VI was another \u00a31,387,000.<ref>Penry Williams, ''The Tudor Regime'' (1979) pp 55\u201369.</ref>\n\nAfter 1540, the Privy Coffers were responsible for 'secret affairs', in particular for the financing of war. The [[Royal Mint]] was used to generate revenue by debasing the coinage; the government's profit in 1547\u201351 was \u00a31.2 million. However, under the direction of regent Northumberland, Edward's wars were brought to an end. The mint no longer generated extra revenue after debasement was stopped in 1551.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Tittler|author2=Norman Jones|title=A Companion to Tudor Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9_3ktSGOEwC&pg=PA187|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=187|isbn=9781405137409}}</ref>\n\n===Edward VI: 1547\u20131553===\n{{Further|Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland}}\nAlthough Henry was only in his mid-50s, his health deteriorated rapidly in 1546. At the time the conservative faction, led by Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner]] and [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]] that was opposed to religious reformation seemed to be in power, and was poised to take control of the regency of the nine-year-old boy who was heir to the throne. However, when the king died, the pro-reformation factions suddenly seized control of the new king, and of the Regency Council, under the leadership of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]]. Bishop Gardiner was discredited, and the Duke of Norfolk was imprisoned for all of the new king's reign.<ref>W.K. Jordan, ''Edward VI: The Young King. The Protectorship of the Duke of Somerset'' (1968)</ref>\n\nThe short reign of Edward VI marked the triumph of Protestantism in England. Somerset, the elder brother of the late Queen [[Jane Seymour]] (married to Henry VIII) and uncle to King Edward VI had a successful military career. When the boy king was crowned, Somerset became [[Lord Protector]] of the realm and in effect ruled England from 1547 to 1549. Seymour led expensive, inconclusive wars with Scotland. His religious policies angered Catholics. Purgatory was rejected so there was no more need for prayers to saints, relics, and statues, nor for masses for the dead. Some 2400 permanent endowments called [[Chantry|chantries]] had been established that supported thousands of priests who celebrated masses for the dead, or operated schools or hospitals in order to earn grace for the soul in purgatory. The endowments were seized by Cromwell in 1547.<ref>G.R. Elton, ''The Tudor Constitution'' (1960) pp 372, 382\u201385.</ref><ref>Dickens, ''The English Reformation,'' pp 197\u2013229.</ref> Historians have contrasted the efficiency of Somerset's takeover of power in 1547 with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule. By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. He was overthrown by his former ally [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]].<ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''The Boy King: Edward VI and the Protestant Reformation'' (2002) p 104.</ref>\n\nUntil recent decades, Somerset's reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class. In the early 20th century this line was taken by the influential [[A. F. Pollard]], to be echoed by Edward VI's leading biographer [[Wilbur Kitchener Jordan|W. K. Jordan]]. A more critical approach was initiated by M. L. Bush and Dale Hoak in the mid-1970s. Since then, Somerset has often been portrayed as an arrogant ruler, devoid of the political and administrative skills necessary for governing the Tudor state.<ref>G.R.

To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing, appointed [[Lord Lieutenant|Lords Lieutenants]] who were in close contact with London, and set up what amounted to a standing national army. Working closely with [[Thomas Cranmer|Thomas Cramner]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dudley pursued an aggressively Protestant religious policy. They promoted radical reformers to high Church positions, with the Catholic bishops under attack. The use of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' became law in 1549; prayers were to be in English not Latin. The Mass was no longer to be celebrated, and preaching became the centerpiece of church services.\n\n[[Purgatory]], Protestantism declared, was a Catholic superstition that falsified the Scriptures. Prayers for the dead were useless because no one was actually in Purgatory. It followed that prayers to saints, veneration of relics, and adoration of statues were all useless superstitions that had to end. For centuries devout Englishman had created endowments called [[chantry|chantries]] designed as good works that generated grace to help them get out of purgatory after they died. Many chantries were altars or chapels inside churches, or endowments that supported thousands of priests who said Masses for the dead. In addition there were many schools and hospitals established as good works. In 1547 a new law closed down 2,374 chantries and seized their assets.<ref>G.R. Elton, ''The Tudor Constitution'' (1960) pp 372, 382\u201385.</ref> Although the Act required the money to go to \"charitable\" ends and the \"public good,\" most of it appears to have gone to friends of the Court.<ref>A.G.

[was] the disappearance of a large clerical society from their midst, the silencing of masses, the rupture of both visible and spiritual ties, which over so many centuries have linked rude provincial man with a great world of the Faith. ... The Edwardian dissolution exerted its profounder effects in the field of religion. In large part it proved destructive, for while it helped to debar a revival of Catholic devotion it clearly contain elements which injured the reputation of Protestantism.<ref>A.G. Dickens, The English Reformation'' (1964) p 217</ref>\n\nThe new Protestant orthodoxy for the Church of England was expressed in the [[Thirty-nine Articles#Forty-Two Articles (1553)|Forty-Two Articles of Faith]] in 1553. But when the king suddenly died, Dudley's last-minute efforts to make his daughter-in-law [[Lady Jane Grey]] the new sovereign failed after only nine days of her reign. Queen Mary took over and had him beheaded and had Jane Grey beheaded after Thomas Wyatt's protestant rebellion against the marriage of the queen and [[Philip II of Spain]] less than a year later.<ref>Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors,'' pp 508\u201322.</ref><ref>Dickens, ''The English Reformation,'' 230-58.</ref>\n\n===Mary I: 1553-1558===\n{{Main|Mary I of England}}\nMary was the daughter of Henry VIII by [[Catherine of Aragon]]; she closely identified with her Catholic, Spanish heritage. She was next in line for the throne. However, in 1553 as Edward VI lay dying, he and the Duke of Northumberland plotted to make his first cousin once removed [[Lady Jane Grey]] as the new Queen. Northumberland, a duke,  wanted to keep control of the government, and promote Protestantism. Edward signed a devise to alter the succession, but that was not legal, for only Parliament could amend its own acts. Edward's Privy Council kept his death secret for three days to install Lady Jane, but Northumberland had neglected to take control of Princess Mary. She fled and organised a band of supporters, who proclaimed her Queen across the country. The Privy Council abandoned Northumberland, and proclaimed Mary to be the sovereign after nine days of the pretended Jane Grey. Queen Mary imprisoned Lady Jane and executed Northumberland.<ref>Paulina Kewes, \"The 1553 succession crisis reconsidered.\" ''Historical Research'' (2017). doi:10.1111/1468-2281.12178</ref><ref>Stanley T.

Her status became a major domestic and international issue for England.<ref>John Guy, ''Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart'' (2014),</ref> especially after the death of King James IV at the [[Battle of Flodden]] in 1513. The upshot was years of struggle for control of the throne, nominally held by the infant king [[James V]] (lived 1512\u201342, reigned 1513\u201342), until he came of age in 1528.\n\n[[Mary of Guise]] (lived 1515\u201360) was a French woman close to the French throne. She ruled as the regent for her teenaged daughter Queen Mary, 1554\u201360. The regent and her daughter were both strong proponents of Catholicism and attempted to suppress the rapidly Growth of Protestantism in Scotland. Mary of Guise was a strong opponent of Protestantism, and worked to maintain a close alliance between Scotland and France, called the [[Auld Alliance]]. In 1559 the Regent became alarmed that widespread Scottish hostility against French rule was strengthening the partisan cause, so she banned unauthorised preaching. But the fiery preacher [[John Knox]] sent Scotland aflame with his preaching, leading the coalition of powerful Scottish nobles, calling themselves the [[Lords of the Congregation]] raised the rebellion to overthrow the Catholic Church and seize its lands. The Lords appealed to Elizabeth for English help, but she played a very cautious hand. The 1559 treaty with France called for peace and she was unwilling to violate it, especially since England had no allies at the time. Supporting rebels against the lawful ruler violated Elizabeth's deeply held claims to the legitimacy of all royalty. On the other hand, a French victory in Scotland would establish a Catholic state on the northern border supported by a powerful French enemy. Elizabeth first sent money, then sent artillery, then sent a fleet that destroyed the French fleet in Scotland. Finally she sent 8,000 troops north. The death of Mary of Guise allowed England, France and Scotland to come to terms in the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]] in 1560, which had a far-reaching impact. France permanently withdrew all its forces from Scotland. It ensured the success of the Reformation in Scotland; it began a century of peace with France; it ended any threat of a Scottish invasion; and it paved the way for a union of the two kingdoms in 1603 when the Scottish king James VI inherited the English throne as James I and launched the Stuart era.<ref>Paul E.J. Hammer, ''Elizabeth's wars: war, government and society in Tudor England, 1544\u20131604'' (2003).</ref>\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, Mary was in Paris as the wife of the French King [[Francis II of France|Francis II]]. When he died in 1561, she returned to Scotland as Queen of Scotland. However, when Elizabeth refused to recognise her as the heir to the English throne, Mary rejected the Treaty of Edinburgh. She made an unfortunate marriage to [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]] who mistreated her and murdered her Italian favourite [[David Rizzio]]. Darnley in turn was murdered by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|the Earl of Bothwell]]. He was acquitted of murder; she quickly married Bothwell. Most people at the time thought she was deeply involved in adultery or murder; historians have argued at length and are undecided. However rebellion broke out and the Protestant nobles defeated the Queen's forces in 1567.<ref>Guy, ''Queen of Scots '', chapters 13\u201327</ref> She was forced to abdicate in favour of her infant son James VI; she fled to England, where Elizabeth confined her and house arrest for 19 years. Mary engaged in numerous complex plots to assassinate Elizabeth and become queen herself. Finally Elizabeth caught her plotting the [[Babington Plot]] and had her executed in 1587.<ref>Black, ''The Reign of Elizabeth'' pp 63\u2013118,, 372\u201389.</ref><ref>David Loades, ''Elizabeth I'' (2003) pp 175\u2013178, 220\u201333.</ref>\n\n====Troubled later years: 1585\u20131603====\nElizabeth's final two decades saw mounting problems that were left for the Stuarts to solve after 1603. John Cramsie, in reviewing the recent scholarship in 2003, argues:\n: the period 1585\u20131603 is now recognised by scholars as distinctly more troubled than the first half of Elizabeth's long reign. Costly wars against Spain and the Irish, involvement in the Netherlands, socio-economic distress, and an authoritarian turn by the regime all cast a pall over Gloriana's final years, underpinning a weariness with the queen's rule and open criticism of her government and its failures.<ref>John Cramsie, \"The Changing Reputations of Elizabeth I and James VI & I,\" [http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/334 ''Reviews and History: Covering books and digital resources across all fields of history'' (review no. 334 June 2003)]</ref>\nElizabeth remained a strong leader, but almost all of her earlier advisers had died or retired. [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] (1563\u20131612) took over the role of leading advisor long held by his father [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley.]] [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] (1567\u20131601) was her most prominent general, a role previously held by his stepfather [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], who was the love of Elizabeth's life; and the adventurer/historian Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] (1552\u20131618) was a new face on the scene. The three new men formed a triangle of interlocking and opposing forces that was hard to break into. The first vacancy came in 1601, when Devereux was executed for attempting to take the Queen prisoner and seize power.<ref>Penry Williams, ''The Later Tudors: England, 1547\u20131603'' (1998) pp 325\u201328, 370\u201373.</ref> After Elizabeth died the new king kept on Cecil as his chief advisor, and beheaded Raleigh.\n\n==Popular uprisings==\n{{See also|List of Tudor Rebellions}}\nNumerous popular uprisings occurred; all suppressed by royal authorities.

He was appointed for a one-year term, with no renewals, by the King's Privy Council.  He was paid many small fees, but they probably did not meet the sheriff's expenses in terms of hospitality and hiring his under-sheriffs and bailiffs.  The sheriff held court every month to deal with civil and criminal cases.  He supervised elections, ran the jail and meted out punishments.  His subordinates provided staffing for the county's justices of the peace.\n\nThe Lord Lieutenant was a new office created by Henry VIII to represent the royal power in each county. He was a person with good enough connections at court to be selected by the king and served at the king's pleasure, often for decades.<ref>Cheyney, ''The European Background'' (1904) pp 270\u201373.</ref> He had  limited powers of direct control, so successful Lord Lieutenants  worked with his deputy lieutenants and  dealt with the  gentry through  compromise, consensus, and the inclusion of opposing factions.  He was in charge of mobilising the militia if necessary for defence, or to assist the king in military operations.  In [[Yorkshire]] in 1588, the Lord Lieutenant was the Earl of Huntington, who urgently needed to prepare defences in the face of the threatened invasion from the Spanish Armada.  The Queen's Privy Council urgently called upon him to mobilise the militia, and report on the availability of men and horses. Huntington's challenge was  to overcome the reluctance of many militia men, the  shortages of arms, training mishaps, and jealousy among the gentry as to who would command which unit. Despite Huntingdon's last-minute  efforts, the mobilisation of 1588 revealed a reluctant society that only grudgingly answered the call to arms.  The Armada never landed, and the militia were not actually used.<ref>Michael J.

The Tudor period coincides with the dynasty of the [[House of Tudor]] in England whose first monarch was [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]] (b.1457, r.1485{{ndash}}1509). Historian [[John Guy (historian)|John Guy]] (1988) argued that \"England was economically healthier, more expansive, and more optimistic under the Tudors\" than at any time in a hundred years.<ref>John Guy (1988) ''Tudor England'', Oxford University Press, p. 32</ref>\n\n==Population and economy==\nFollowing the [[Black Death]] and the agricultural depression of the late 15th century, the population began to increase. It was less than 2 million in 1600. The growing population stimulated economic growth, accelerated the commercialisation of agriculture, increased the production and export of wool, encouraged trade, and promoted the growth of London.<ref>David M. Palliser, ''The Age of Elizabeth: England under the later Tudors, 1547\u20131603'' p. 300.</ref>\n\nThe high wages and abundance of available land seen in the late 15th century and early 16th century were replaced with low wages and a land shortage. Various inflationary pressures, perhaps due to an influx of New World gold and a rising population, set the stage for social upheaval with the gap between the rich and poor widening. This was a period of significant change for the majority of the rural population, with [[manorial]] lords beginning the process of [[enclosure]] of village lands that previously had been open to everyone.<ref>Ian Dawson, ''The Tudor century'' (1993) p. 214</ref>\n\n==English Reformation==\n{{Main|English Reformation}}\nThe Reformation transformed English religion during the Tudor period. The five sovereigns, Henry VII, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I, and Elizabeth I had entirely different approaches, with Henry VIII replacing the pope as the head of the Church of England but maintaining Catholic doctrines, Edward imposing a very strict Protestantism, Mary attempting to reinstate Catholicism, and Elizabeth arriving at a compromise position that defined the not-quite-Protestant Church of England. It began with the insistent demands of Henry VIII for an annulment of his marriage that [[Pope Clement VII]] refused to grant.<ref>Peter H. Marshall, ''Heretics and Believers: A History of the English Reformation'' (Yale UP, 2017).</ref>\n\nHistorians agreed that the great theme of Tudor history was the Reformation, the transformation of England from Catholicism to Protestantism. The main events, constitutional changes, and players at the national level have long been known, and the major controversies about them largely resolved. Historians until the late 20th century thought that the causes were: a widespread dissatisfaction or even disgust with the evils, corruptions, failures, and contradictions of the established religion, setting up an undertone of [[anti-clericalism]] that indicated a rightness for reform. A secondary influence was the intellectual impact of certain English reformers, such as the long-term impact of [[John Wycliffe]] (1328\u20131384) and his \u201c[[Lollardy]]\u201d reform movement, together with a stream of Reformation treatises and pamphlets from [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]], and other reformers on the continent. The interpretation by [[Geoffrey Elton]] in 1960 is representative of the orthodox interpretation. He argued that:\n:The existing situation proved untenable because the laity feared, resented, and despised much about the Church, its officers, its courts and its wealth. ... A poverty-stricken and ignorant lower clergy, wealthy bishops and abbots, a wide ramification of jurisdiction, a mixture of high claims and low deeds did not make for respect or love among the laity.<ref>G. R. Elton, ''The Tudor Constitution: Documents and Commentary'' (1960) pp 318\u201319</ref>\n\nSocial historians after 1960 investigated English religion at the local level, and discovered the dissatisfaction had not been so widespread. The Lollardy movement had largely expired, and the pamphleteering of continental reformers hardly reached beyond a few scholars at the [[University of Cambridge]]\u2014King Henry VIII had vigorously and publicly denounced Luther's heresies. More important, the Catholic Church was in a strong condition in 1500. England was devoutly Catholic, it was loyal to the pope, local parishes attracted strong local financial support, religious services were quite popular both at Sunday Mass and at family devotions. Complaints about the monasteries and the bishops were uncommon. The kings backed the popes and by the time Luther appeared on the scene, England was among the strongest supporters of orthodox Catholicism, and seemed a most unlikely place for a religious revolution.<ref>Ronald H.

In foreign-policy, he focused on fighting France\u2014with minimal success\u2014and had to deal with Scotland, Spain, and the Holy Roman Empire, often with military mobilisation or actual highly expensive warfare that led to high taxes. The chief military success came over Scotland.<ref>E. W. Ives, \"Henry VIII (1491\u20131547)\", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography,'' (2009) [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/12955, accessed 8 Aug 2017]</ref> The main policy development was Henry's taking full control of the Church of England. This followed from his break from Rome, which was caused by the refusal of the Pope to annul his original marriage. Henry thereby introduced a very mild variation of the Protestant Reformation. There were two main aspects. First Henry rejected the Pope as the head of the Church in England, insisting that national sovereignty required the Absolute supremacy of the king. Henry worked closely with Parliament in passing a series of laws that implemented the break. Englishmen could no longer appeal to Rome. All the decisions were to be made in England, ultimately by the King himself, and in practice by top aides such as Cardinal Wolsey and Thomas Cromwell. Parliament proved highly supportive, with little dissent. The decisive moves came with the [[Acts of Supremacy|Act of Supremacy in 1534]] that made the king the protector and only supreme head of the church and clergy of England. After Henry imposed a heavy fine on the bishops, they nearly all complied. The laws of treason were greatly strengthened so that verbal dissent alone was treasonous. There were some short-lived popular rebellions that were quickly suppressed. The league level in terms of the aristocracy and the Church was supportive. The highly visible main refusals came from Bishop Fisher and Chancellor Thomas More; they were both executed. Among the senior aristocrats, trouble came from the Pole family, which supported [[Reginald Pole]] who was in exile in Europe. Henry destroyed the rest of the family, executing its leaders, and seizing all its property. The second stage involved the seizure of the monasteries. The monasteries operating religious and charitable institutions were closed, the monks and nuns were pensioned off, and the valuable lands were sold to friends of the King, thereby producing a large, wealthy, gentry class that supported Henry. In terms of theology and ritual there was little change, as Henry wanted to keep most elements of Catholicism and detested the \"heresies\" of Martin Luther and the other reformers.<ref>Richard Rex, ''Henry VIII and the English reformation'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2006).</ref>\n\n====Father of the Royal Navy====\nBiographer [[Jack Scarisbrick|J.J. Scarisbrick]] says that Henry deserved his traditional title of \"Father of the English navy.\"<ref>J.J. Scarisbrick, ''Henry VIII'' (1968) pp 500\u20131.</ref> It became his personal weapon. He inherited seven small warships from his father, and added two dozen more by 1514. In addition to those built in England, he bought up Italian and Hanseatic warships. By March 1513, he proudly watched his fleet sail down the Thames under command of Sir Edmund Howard. It was the most powerful naval force to date in English history: 24 ships led by the 1600 ton \"Henry Imperial\"; the fleet carried 5000 combat marines and 3000 sailors. It forced the outnumbered French fleet back to its ports, took control of the English Channel, and blockaded Brest. Henry was the first king to organise the navy as a permanent force, with a permanent administrative and logistical structure, funded by tax revenue. His personal attention was concentrated on land, where he founded the royal dockyards, planted trees for shipbuilding, enacted laws for in land navigation, guarded the coastline with fortifications, set up a school for navigation and designated the roles of officers and sailors. He closely supervised the construction of all his warships and their guns, knowing their designs, speed, tonnage, armaments and battle tactics. He encouraged his naval architects, who perfected the Italian technique of mounting guns in the waist of the ship, thus lowering the centre of gravity and making it a better platform. He supervised the smallest details and enjoyed nothing more than presiding over the launching of a new ship.<ref>A.F. Pollard, ''Henry VIII'' (1902) pp 50, 100\u20132.</ref> He drained his treasury on military and naval affairs, diverting the revenues from new taxes and the sales of monastery lands.<ref>N.A.M.

It lacked a useful strategy. It did serve for defence against invasion, and for enhancing England's international prestige.<ref>G.R.

He was amazingly energetic and far-reaching. In terms of achievements, he built a great fortune for himself, and was a major benefactor of arts, humanities and education. He projected numerous reforms, but in the end English government had not changed much. For all the promise, there was very little achievement of note. From the king's perspective, his greatest failure was an inability to get a divorce when Henry VIII needed a new wife to give him a son who would be the undisputed heir to the throne. Historians agree that Wolsey was a disappointment. In the end, he conspired with Henry's enemies, and died of natural causes before he could be beheaded.<ref>S.T.

Elton, ''The Tudor Revolution in Government'' (1953).</ref> Cromwell (1485\u20131540)<ref>He was a distant relative of [[Oliver Cromwell]] (1599\u20131658) who ruled a century later.</ref> replaced medieval government-as-household-management. Cromwell introduced reforms into the administration that delineated the King's household from the state and created a modern administration. He injected Tudor power into the darker corners of the realm and radically altered the role of the [[Parliament of England]]. This transition happened in the 1530s, Elton argued, and must be regarded as part of a planned revolution. Elton's point was that before Cromwell the realm could be viewed as the King's private estate writ large, where most administration was done by the King's household servants rather than separate state offices. By masterminding these reforms, Cromwell laid the foundations of England's future stability and success. Cromwell's luck ran out when he picked [[Anne of Cleves|the wrong bride]] for the King; he was beheaded for treason, More recently historians have emphasised that the king and others played powerful roles as well.<ref>Christoper Coleman and David Starkey, eds., ''Revolution Reassessed: Revision in the History of Tudor Government and Administration'' (1986)</ref><ref>Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors 1485 \u2013 1558'' (1952), pp 413\u201317.</ref>\n\n====Dissolution of the Monasteries: 1536\u20131545====\n{{main|Dissolution of the Monasteries}}\nThe king had an annual income of about \u00a3100,000, but he needed much more in order to suppress rebellions and finance his foreign adventures. In 1533, for example, military expenditures on the northern border cost \u00a325,000, while the 1534 rebellion in Ireland cost \u00a338,000. Suppressing the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]] cost \u00a350,000, and the king's new palaces were expensive. Meanwhile, customs revenue was slipping. The Church had an annual revenue of about \u00a3300,000; a new tax of 10% was imposed which brought in about \u00a330,000. To get even larger sums it was proposed to seize the lands owned by monasteries, some of which the monks farmed and most of which was leased to local gentry. Taking ownership meant the rents went to the king. Selling the land to the gentry at a bargain price brought in \u00a31 million in one-time revenue and gave the gentry a stake in the administration.<ref>Mackie, ''The Earlier Tudors'', pp 370\u201379.</ref> The clerical payments from [[Annates|First Fruits and Tenths]], which previously went to the pope, now went to the king. Altogether, between 1536 and Henry's death, his government collected \u00a31.3 million; this huge influx of money caused Cromwell to change the Crown's financial system to manage the money. He created a new department of state and a new official to collect the proceeds of the dissolution and the First Fruits and Tenths. The [[Court of Augmentations]] and number of departments meant a growing number of officials, which made the management of revenue a major activity.<ref>{{cite book|author=John A.

Its drawback was the multiplication of departments whose sole unifying agent was Cromwell; his fall caused confusion and uncertainty; the solution was even greater reliance on bureaucratic institutions and the new Privy Council.<ref>{{cite book|author=D.

How to pay for it remained a serious issue. The growing number of departments meant many new salaried bureaucrats. There were further financial and administrative difficulties in 1540\u201358, aggravated by war, debasement, corruption and inefficiency, which were mainly caused by Somerset. After Cromwell's fall, [[William Paulet, 1st Marquess of Winchester]], the [[Lord High Treasurer|Lord Treasurer]], produced further reforms to simplify the arrangements, reforms which united most of the crown's finance under the exchequer. The courts of general surveyors and augmentations were fused into a new Court of Augmentations, and this was later absorbed into the exchequer along with the First Fruits and Tenths.<ref>{{cite book|author=John A.

There was little debt, and he left his son a large treasury. Henry VIII spent heavily on luxuries, such as tapestries and palaces, but his peacetime budget was generally satisfactory. The heavy strain came from warfare, including building defences, building a Navy, Suppressing insurrections, warring with Scotland, and engaging in very expensive continental warfare. Henry's Continental wars won him little glory or diplomatic influence, and no territory. Nevertheless, warfare 1511 to 1514 with three large expeditions and two smaller ones cost \u00a3912,000. The Boulogne campaign of 1544 cost \u00a31,342,000 and the wars against Scotland \u00a3954,000; the naval wars cost \u00a3149,000 and large sums were spent to build and maintain inland and coastal fortifications. The total cost of war and defence between 1539\u20131547 was well over \u00a32,000,000, although the accounting procedures were too primitive to give an accurate total. Adding it all up, approximately 35% came from taxes, 32% from selling land and monastery holdings, and 30% from debasing the coinage. The cost of war in the short reign of Edward VI was another \u00a31,387,000.<ref>Penry Williams, ''The Tudor Regime'' (1979) pp 55\u201369.</ref>\n\nAfter 1540, the Privy Coffers were responsible for 'secret affairs', in particular for the financing of war. The [[Royal Mint]] was used to generate revenue by debasing the coinage; the government's profit in 1547\u201351 was \u00a31.2 million. However, under the direction of regent Northumberland, Edward's wars were brought to an end. The mint no longer generated extra revenue after debasement was stopped in 1551.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Robert Tittler|author2=Norman Jones|title=A Companion to Tudor Britain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F9_3ktSGOEwC&pg=PA187|year=2008|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|page=187|isbn=9781405137409}}</ref>\n\n===Edward VI: 1547\u20131553===\n{{Further|Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland}}\nAlthough Henry was only in his mid-50s, his health deteriorated rapidly in 1546. At the time the conservative faction, led by Bishop [[Stephen Gardiner]] and [[Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk]] that was opposed to religious reformation seemed to be in power, and was poised to take control of the regency of the nine-year-old boy who was heir to the throne. However, when the king died, the pro-reformation factions suddenly seized control of the new king, and of the Regency Council, under the leadership of [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset|Edward Seymour]]. Bishop Gardiner was discredited, and the Duke of Norfolk was imprisoned for all of the new king's reign.<ref>W.K. Jordan, ''Edward VI: The Young King. The Protectorship of the Duke of Somerset'' (1968)</ref>\n\nThe short reign of Edward VI marked the triumph of Protestantism in England. Somerset, the elder brother of the late Queen [[Jane Seymour]] (married to Henry VIII) and uncle to King Edward VI had a successful military career. When the boy king was crowned, Somerset became [[Lord Protector]] of the realm and in effect ruled England from 1547 to 1549. Seymour led expensive, inconclusive wars with Scotland. His religious policies angered Catholics. Purgatory was rejected so there was no more need for prayers to saints, relics, and statues, nor for masses for the dead. Some 2400 permanent endowments called [[Chantry|chantries]] had been established that supported thousands of priests who celebrated masses for the dead, or operated schools or hospitals in order to earn grace for the soul in purgatory. The endowments were seized by Cromwell in 1547.<ref>G.R. Elton, ''The Tudor Constitution'' (1960) pp 372, 382\u201385.</ref><ref>Dickens, ''The English Reformation,'' pp 197\u2013229.</ref> Historians have contrasted the efficiency of Somerset's takeover of power in 1547 with the subsequent ineptitude of his rule. By autumn 1549, his costly wars had lost momentum, the crown faced financial ruin, and riots and rebellions had broken out around the country. He was overthrown by his former ally [[John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland]].<ref>Diarmaid MacCulloch, ''The Boy King: Edward VI and the Protestant Reformation'' (2002) p 104.</ref>\n\nUntil recent decades, Somerset's reputation with historians was high, in view of his many proclamations that appeared to back the common people against a rapacious landowning class. In the early 20th century this line was taken by the influential [[A. F. Pollard]], to be echoed by Edward VI's leading biographer [[Wilbur Kitchener Jordan|W. K. Jordan]]. A more critical approach was initiated by M. L. Bush and Dale Hoak in the mid-1970s. Since then, Somerset has often been portrayed as an arrogant ruler, devoid of the political and administrative skills necessary for governing the Tudor state.<ref>G.R.

To prevent further uprisings he introduced countrywide policing, appointed [[Lord Lieutenant|Lords Lieutenants]] who were in close contact with London, and set up what amounted to a standing national army. Working closely with [[Thomas Cranmer|Thomas Cramner]], the Archbishop of Canterbury, Dudley pursued an aggressively Protestant religious policy. They promoted radical reformers to high Church positions, with the Catholic bishops under attack. The use of the ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'' became law in 1549; prayers were to be in English not Latin. The Mass was no longer to be celebrated, and preaching became the centerpiece of church services.\n\n[[Purgatory]], Protestantism declared, was a Catholic superstition that falsified the Scriptures. Prayers for the dead were useless because no one was actually in Purgatory. It followed that prayers to saints, veneration of relics, and adoration of statues were all useless superstitions that had to end. For centuries devout Englishman had created endowments called [[chantry|chantries]] designed as good works that generated grace to help them get out of purgatory after they died. Many chantries were altars or chapels inside churches, or endowments that supported thousands of priests who said Masses for the dead. In addition there were many schools and hospitals established as good works. In 1547 a new law closed down 2,374 chantries and seized their assets.<ref>G.R. Elton, ''The Tudor Constitution'' (1960) pp 372, 382\u201385.</ref> Although the Act required the money to go to \"charitable\" ends and the \"public good,\" most of it appears to have gone to friends of the Court.<ref>A.G.

[was] the disappearance of a large clerical society from their midst, the silencing of masses, the rupture of both visible and spiritual ties, which over so many centuries have linked rude provincial man with a great world of the Faith. ... The Edwardian dissolution exerted its profounder effects in the field of religion. In large part it proved destructive, for while it helped to debar a revival of Catholic devotion it clearly contain elements which injured the reputation of Protestantism.<ref>A.G.

But when the king suddenly died, Dudley's last-minute efforts to make his daughter-in-law [[Lady Jane Grey]] the new sovereign failed after only nine days of her reign.

Northumberland, a duke,  wanted to keep control of the government, and promote Protestantism. Edward signed a devise to alter the succession, but that was not legal, for only Parliament could amend its own acts. Edward's Privy Council kept his death secret for three days to install Lady Jane, but Northumberland had neglected to take control of Princess Mary. She fled and organised a band of supporters, who proclaimed her Queen across the country. The Privy Council abandoned Northumberland, and proclaimed Mary to be the sovereign after nine days of the pretended Jane Grey.

''The Oxford illustrated history of Tudor & Stuart Britain'' (1996) [https://archive.org/details/oxfordillustrate00john online] pp 44, 325.</ref>\nElizabeth's reign marks the decisive turning point in English religious history, as a predominantly Catholic nation at the beginning of her reign was predominantly Protestant by the end. Although Elizabeth executed 250 Catholic priests, she also executed some extreme Puritans, and on the whole she sought a moderately conservative position that mixed Royal control of the church (with no people role), combined with predominantly Catholic ritual, and a predominantly Calvinists theology.<ref>J.B. Black, ''The Reign of Elizabeth: 1558\u20131603'' (1959) pp 1\u201333, 166\u2013205.</ref>\n\n====Scotland and Mary, Queen of Scots====\n{{Further|Mary, Queen of Scots|Anglo-Scottish Wars}}\n[[Mary, Queen of Scots]] (lived 1542\u201387) was a devout Catholic and next in line for the throne of England after Elizabeth. Her status became a major domestic and international issue for England.<ref>John Guy, ''Queen of Scots: The True Life of Mary Stuart'' (2014),</ref> especially after the death of King James IV at the [[Battle of Flodden]] in 1513. The upshot was years of struggle for control of the throne, nominally held by the infant king [[James V]] (lived 1512\u201342, reigned 1513\u201342), until he came of age in 1528.\n\n[[Mary of Guise]] (lived 1515\u201360) was a French woman close to the French throne. She ruled as the regent for her teenaged daughter Queen Mary, 1554\u201360. The regent and her daughter were both strong proponents of Catholicism and attempted to suppress the rapidly Growth of Protestantism in Scotland. Mary of Guise was a strong opponent of Protestantism, and worked to maintain a close alliance between Scotland and France, called the [[Auld Alliance]]. In 1559 the Regent became alarmed that widespread Scottish hostility against French rule was strengthening the partisan cause, so she banned unauthorised preaching. But the fiery preacher [[John Knox]] sent Scotland aflame with his preaching, leading the coalition of powerful Scottish nobles, calling themselves the [[Lords of the Congregation]] raised the rebellion to overthrow the Catholic Church and seize its lands. The Lords appealed to Elizabeth for English help, but she played a very cautious hand. The 1559 treaty with France called for peace and she was unwilling to violate it, especially since England had no allies at the time. Supporting rebels against the lawful ruler violated Elizabeth's deeply held claims to the legitimacy of all royalty. On the other hand, a French victory in Scotland would establish a Catholic state on the northern border supported by a powerful French enemy. Elizabeth first sent money, then sent artillery, then sent a fleet that destroyed the French fleet in Scotland. Finally she sent 8,000 troops north. The death of Mary of Guise allowed England, France and Scotland to come to terms in the [[Treaty of Edinburgh]] in 1560, which had a far-reaching impact. France permanently withdrew all its forces from Scotland. It ensured the success of the Reformation in Scotland; it began a century of peace with France; it ended any threat of a Scottish invasion; and it paved the way for a union of the two kingdoms in 1603 when the Scottish king James VI inherited the English throne as James I and launched the Stuart era.<ref>Paul E.J. Hammer, ''Elizabeth's wars: war, government and society in Tudor England, 1544\u20131604'' (2003).</ref>\n\nWhen the treaty was signed, Mary was in Paris as the wife of the French King [[Francis II of France|Francis II]]. When he died in 1561, she returned to Scotland as Queen of Scotland. However, when Elizabeth refused to recognise her as the heir to the English throne, Mary rejected the Treaty of Edinburgh. She made an unfortunate marriage to [[Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley|Lord Darnley]] who mistreated her and murdered her Italian favourite [[David Rizzio]]. Darnley in turn was murdered by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell|the Earl of Bothwell]]. He was acquitted of murder; she quickly married Bothwell. Most people at the time thought she was deeply involved in adultery or murder; historians have argued at length and are undecided. However rebellion broke out and the Protestant nobles defeated the Queen's forces in 1567.<ref>Guy, ''Queen of Scots '', chapters 13\u201327</ref> She was forced to abdicate in favour of her infant son James VI; she fled to England, where Elizabeth confined her and house arrest for 19 years. Mary engaged in numerous complex plots to assassinate Elizabeth and become queen herself. Finally Elizabeth caught her plotting the [[Babington Plot]] and had her executed in 1587.<ref>Black, ''The Reign of Elizabeth'' pp 63\u2013118,, 372\u201389.</ref><ref>David Loades, ''Elizabeth I'' (2003) pp 175\u2013178, 220\u201333.</ref>\n\n====Troubled later years: 1585\u20131603====\nElizabeth's final two decades saw mounting problems that were left for the Stuarts to solve after 1603. John Cramsie, in reviewing the recent scholarship in 2003, argues:\n: the period 1585\u20131603 is now recognised by scholars as distinctly more troubled than the first half of Elizabeth's long reign. Costly wars against Spain and the Irish, involvement in the Netherlands, socio-economic distress, and an authoritarian turn by the regime all cast a pall over Gloriana's final years, underpinning a weariness with the queen's rule and open criticism of her government and its failures.<ref>John Cramsie, \"The Changing Reputations of Elizabeth I and James VI & I,\" [http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/334 ''Reviews and History: Covering books and digital resources across all fields of history'' (review no. 334 June 2003)]</ref>\nElizabeth remained a strong leader, but almost all of her earlier advisers had died or retired. [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury|Robert Cecil]] (1563\u20131612) took over the role of leading advisor long held by his father [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley.]] [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]] (1567\u20131601) was her most prominent general, a role previously held by his stepfather [[Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester|Robert Dudley]], who was the love of Elizabeth's life; and the adventurer/historian Sir [[Walter Raleigh]] (1552\u20131618) was a new face on the scene. The three new men formed a triangle of interlocking and opposing forces that was hard to break into. The first vacancy came in 1601, when Devereux was executed for attempting to take the Queen prisoner and seize power.<ref>Penry Williams, ''The Later Tudors: England, 1547\u20131603'' (1998) pp 325\u201328, 370\u201373.</ref> After Elizabeth died the new king kept on Cecil as his chief advisor, and beheaded Raleigh.\n\n==Popular uprisings==\n{{See also|List of Tudor Rebellions}}\nNumerous popular uprisings occurred; all suppressed by royal authorities. The largest were:\n* The largest and most serious was the [[Pilgrimage of Grace]]. It disrupted the North of England in 1536 protesting the religious reforms of Henry VIII, his [[Dissolution of the Monasteries]] and the policies of the King's chief minister, [[Thomas Cromwell]], as well as other specific political, social and economic grievances.<ref>M.L. Bush, \"The Tudor polity and the pilgrimage of grace.\" ''Historical Research'' 80.207 (2007): 47\u201372.

The Royal Court introduced the ''Book of Common Prayer'', which was based on Protestant theology and the exclusive use of English. The change was widely unpopular \u2013 particularly in areas of still firmly Catholic religious loyalty, and in Cornwall where standard English was not popular.<ref>Frances Rose-Troup, ''The western rebellion of 1549: an account of the insurrections in Devonshire and Cornwall against religious innovations in the reign of Edward VI'', London: Smith, Elder, 1913 [https://archive.org/details/westernrebellion00rose online].</ref>\n*[[Kett's Rebellion]] began in 1549 in Norfolk; it started as a demonstration against [[enclosure]]s of common land. The instigator, Robert Kett, was executed for treason.<ref>Anthony Fletcher and Diarmaid Macculloch, ''Tudor Rebellions'' (5th ed. 2004) pp. 69\u201383</ref>\n*[[Wyatt's rebellion]] in 1554 against Queen Mary I's determination to marry Philip of Spain and named after [[Thomas Wyatt the Younger|Thomas Wyatt]], one of its leaders.<ref>Fletcher (2004) pp. 90-95</ref> \n*The [[Rising of the North]] or \"Northern Rebellion\" of 1569\u201370 was a failed attempt by Catholic nobles from Northern England to depose Queen Elizabeth I of England and replace her with Mary, Queen of Scots. It originated from bitter political factionalism in the royal Privy Concil. The extension of Tudor authority in northern England cause discontent among the aristocracy and gentry, as the new Protestant bishop tried to recover former church lands and alienated their new owners. Local Catholic elements were a large fraction of the population and resented the destruction of the rituals and practices. When the Royal army approached, the leadership disbanded their forces and fled to Scotland. A few leaders were executed, but many of the gentry saved their lives by handing over their lands to Queen Elizabeth.<ref>Fritze, ''Historical Dictionary of Tudor England'' pp 351\u201353.</ref><ref>Krista Kesselring, ''The Northern Rebellion of 1569: Faith, Politics and Protest in Elizabethan England'' (Springer, 2007).</ref>\n\n==Local government==\nThe main officials of the local government operated at the county level (also called \"shire\") were the [[sheriff]] and the [[Lord Lieutenant]].<ref>Edward Potts Cheyney, ''The European Background of American  History: 1300\u20131600'' (1904) pp 261\u201370. [https://archive.org/details/cu31924014479624 online]</ref>   the power of the sheriff had declined since medieval days, but he was still very prestigious.  He was appointed for a one-year term, with no renewals, by the King's Privy Council.  He was paid many small fees, but they probably did not meet the sheriff's expenses in terms of hospitality and hiring his under-sheriffs and bailiffs.  The sheriff held court every month to deal with civil and criminal cases.  He supervised elections, ran the jail and meted out punishments.  His subordinates provided staffing for the county's justices of the peace.\n\nThe Lord Lieutenant was a new office created by Henry VIII to represent the royal power in each county. He was a person with good enough connections at court to be selected by the king and served at the king's pleasure, often for decades.<ref>Cheyney, ''The European Background'' (1904) pp 270\u201373.</ref> He had  limited powers of direct control, so successful Lord Lieutenants  worked with his deputy lieutenants and  dealt with the  gentry through  compromise, consensus, and the inclusion of opposing factions.  He was in charge of mobilising the militia if necessary for defence, or to assist the king in military operations.  In [[Yorkshire]] in 1588, the Lord Lieutenant was the Earl of Huntington, who urgently needed to prepare defences in the face of the threatened invasion from the Spanish Armada.  The Queen's Privy Council urgently called upon him to mobilise the militia, and report on the availability of men and horses. Huntington's challenge was  to overcome the reluctance of many militia men, the  shortages of arms, training mishaps, and jealousy among the gentry as to who would command which unit. Despite Huntingdon's last-minute  efforts, the mobilisation of 1588 revealed a reluctant society that only grudgingly answered the call to arms.  The Armada never landed, and the militia were not actually used.<ref>Michael J. Braddick, \"'Uppon This Instant Extraordinarie Occasion': Military Mobilization in Yorkshire before and after the Armada.\" ''Huntington Library Quarterly'' 61#3/4 (1998): 429\u2013455.</ref>  During the civil wars of the mid-17th century, the Lord Lieutenant played an even more important role in mobilising his county either for king or for Parliament.<ref>Victor L. Stater, ''Noble Government: the Stuart Lord Lieutenancy and the Transformation of English Politics'' (1994).</ref>\n\nThe day-to-day business of government was in the hands of  several dozen [[justice of the peace|justices of the peace]] (JP).  They handled all the real routine police administrative functions, and were paid through a modest level of fees.  Other local officials included constables, church-wardens, mayors, and city aldermen.  The JP duties involved a great deal of paperwork \u2013 primarily in Latin \u2013 and attracted a surprisingly strong cast of candidates.  For example, The 55 JPs in [[Devon]]shire holding office in 1592 included:\n:Sir [[Francis Drake]], Sir [[Ferdinando Gorges]], Gilberts, Carews, Seymours, Courtenays, and other names prominent among the men who laid the foundations of the maritime greatness of England and of the existence of America.  Of the fifty-five, twenty-eight were at one time or another high-sheriffs of the county, twenty more were then, or became afterwards, knights, six sat in the House of Commons, and three in the House of Lords.<ref>Cheyney, ''The European Background '' p 277.</ref>\n\n==Social history and daily life==\nThe cultural achievements of the Elizabethan era have long attracted scholars, and since the 1960s they have conducted intensive research on the [[social history of England]].<ref>Penry Williams, ''The Later Tudors: England, 1547\u20131603'' (New Oxford History of England, 1998), chapters 6, 10, 11, 12.</ref><ref>John Morrill, ed., ''The Oxford Illustrated History of Tudor and Stuart Britain'' (1995) chapters 5 to 10.</ref><ref>D.M.
