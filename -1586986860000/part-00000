Although they are usually transmitted by the [[orofaecal]] route, some are transmitted with the [[Host (biology)|host]]'s [[gamete]]s during [[copulation (zoology)|copulation]] (''[[Monocystis]]).\n\nIn all species, four or more [[sporozoite]]s (the precise number depends on the species) equipped with an apical complex escape from the [[oocyst]]s, a process called excystation, find their way to the appropriate body cavity, and penetrate host cells in their immediate environment. The sporozoites emerge within the host cell, begin to feed, and develop into larger [[trophozoite]]s. In some species, the sporozoites and trophozoites are capable of asexual replication \u2014 a process called [[schizogony]] or [[Protozoal merogony|merogony]]. Most species, however, appear to lack schizogony in their lifecycles.\n\nIn all species, two mature trophozoites eventually pair up in a process known as [[Meiosis|syzygy]] and develop into [[gamont]]s. During syzygy, gamont orientation differs between species (side-to-side, head-to-tail). A [[gametocyst]] wall forms around each pair of gamonts which then begin to divide into hundreds of [[gamete]]s. [[Zygote]]s are produced by the fusion of two gametes and these in turn become surrounded by an oocyst wall. Within the oocyst, [[meiosis]] occurs, yielding the sporozoites. Hundreds of oocysts accumulate within each gametocyst and these are released via host's [[faeces]] or via host death and decay.\n\n[[File:Lankesteria lm.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Lankesteria cystodytae]]'' is an intestinal parasite of [[ascidian]]s.

In the life cycle is an extracellular feeding stage known as the trophozoite.\n\n===Main divisions===\n\n'''Archigregarines''' are found only in marine habitats. They possess intestinal trophozoites similar in morphology to the infective sporozoites. Phylogenetic analysis suggests this group is paraphyletic and will need division. Generally, four zoites are in each spore in this group.\n\n'''Eugregarines''' are found in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. These species possess large trophozoites that are significantly different in morphology and behavior from the sporozoites. This taxon contains most of the known gregarine species. The intestinal [[Eugregarinorida|eugregarines]] are separated into septate \u2014 suborder [[Septatorina]] \u2014 and [[aseptate]] \u2014 suborder [[Aseptatorina]] \u2014 depending on whether the trophozoite is superficially divided by a transverse septum. The aseptate species are mostly marine gregarines.\n\nUrosporidians are aseptate eugregarines that infect the coelomic spaces of marine hosts. Unusually, they tend to lack attachment structures and form gamont pairs that pulsate freely within the [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]].\n\nMonocystids are aseptate eugregarines that infect the reproductive vesicles of terrestrial [[annelid]]s. These latter species tend to branch closely with [[neogregarines]] and may need to be reclassified.  Generally, eight zoites are in each spore in this group.\n\n'''Neogregarines''' are found only in terrestrial hosts. These species have reduced trophozoites and tend to infect tissues other than the intestine. Usually, eight zoites are in each spore in this group.\n\nThe eugregarines and neogregarines differ in a number of respects. The neogregarines are in general more pathogenic to their hosts. The eugregarines multiply by sporogony and gametogony, while the neogregarines have an additional schizogenic stage \u2014 merogony \u2014 within their hosts.

Although they are usually transmitted by the [[orofaecal]] route, some are transmitted with the [[Host (biology)|host]]'s [[gamete]]s during [[copulation (zoology)|copulation]] (''[[Monocystis]]).\n\nIn all species, four or more [[sporozoite]]s (the precise number depends on the species) equipped with an apical complex escape from the [[oocyst]]s, a process called excystation, find their way to the appropriate body cavity, and penetrate host cells in their immediate environment. The sporozoites emerge within the host cell, begin to feed, and develop into larger [[trophozoite]]s. In some species, the sporozoites and trophozoites are capable of asexual replication \u2014 a process called [[schizogony]] or [[Protozoal merogony|merogony]]. Most species, however, appear to lack schizogony in their lifecycles.\n\nIn all species, two mature trophozoites eventually pair up in a process known as [[Meiosis|syzygy]] and develop into [[gamont]]s. During syzygy, gamont orientation differs between species (side-to-side, head-to-tail). A [[gametocyst]] wall forms around each pair of gamonts which then begin to divide into hundreds of [[gamete]]s. [[Zygote]]s are produced by the fusion of two gametes and these in turn become surrounded by an oocyst wall. Within the oocyst, [[meiosis]] occurs, yielding the sporozoites. Hundreds of oocysts accumulate within each gametocyst and these are released via host's [[faeces]] or via host death and decay.\n\n[[File:Lankesteria lm.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''[[Lankesteria cystodytae]]'' is an intestinal parasite of [[ascidian]]s.

In the life cycle is an extracellular feeding stage known as the trophozoite.\n\n===Main divisions===\n\n'''Archigregarines''' are found only in marine habitats. They possess intestinal trophozoites similar in morphology to the infective sporozoites. Phylogenetic analysis suggests this group is paraphyletic and will need division. Generally, four zoites are in each spore in this group.\n\n'''Eugregarines''' are found in marine, freshwater, and terrestrial habitats. These species possess large trophozoites that are significantly different in morphology and behavior from the sporozoites. This taxon contains most of the known gregarine species. The intestinal [[Eugregarinorida|eugregarines]] are separated into septate \u2014 suborder [[Septatorina]] \u2014 and [[aseptate]] \u2014 suborder [[Aseptatorina]] \u2014 depending on whether the trophozoite is superficially divided by a transverse septum. The aseptate species are mostly marine gregarines.\n\nUrosporidians are aseptate eugregarines that infect the coelomic spaces of marine hosts. Unusually, they tend to lack attachment structures and form gamont pairs that pulsate freely within the [[Coelom#Coelomic fluid|coelomic fluid]].\n\nMonocystids are aseptate eugregarines that infect the reproductive vesicles of terrestrial [[annelid]]s. These latter species tend to branch closely with [[neogregarines]] and may need to be reclassified.  Generally, eight zoites are in each spore in this group.\n\n'''Neogregarines''' are found only in terrestrial hosts. These species have reduced trophozoites and tend to infect tissues other than the intestine. Usually, eight zoites are in each spore in this group.\n\nThe eugregarines and neogregarines differ in a number of respects. The neogregarines are in general more pathogenic to their hosts. The eugregarines multiply by sporogony and gametogony, while the neogregarines have an additional schizogenic stage \u2014 merogony \u2014 within their hosts. Merogony may be intracellular or extracellular depending on the species.\n\nDNA studies suggest the [[archigregarines]] are ancestral to the others.<ref name=Leander2008>{{cite journal |author=Leander BS |title=Marine gregarines: evolutionary prelude to the apicomplexan radiation? |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=60\u20137 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18226585 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2007.11.005 }}</ref>\n\n===Proposed revisions===\n\nCavalier-Smith has proposed a significant revision of this taxon assuming the [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|polyphyly]] of [[Eugregarinorida|eugregarine]]s.<ref name=Cavalier-Smith2014>{{cite journal |vauthors=Cavalier-Smith T |title=Gregarine site-heterogeneous 18S rDNA trees, revision of gregarine higher classification, and the evolutionary diversification of Sporozoa |journal=Eur.

The Injun elder does not only willingly share their spirituality with the white intruder but, in fact, must come to the conclusion that this intruder is as good an Indian as they are themselves.

They are the ones \u2013 while melodramatically parting from their spiritual offshoot \u2013 who urge the Plastic Shaman to share their gift with the rest of the world.

The Injun elder does not only willingly share their spirituality with the white intruder but, in fact, must come to the conclusion that this intruder is as good an Indian as they are themselves.

They are the ones \u2013 while melodramatically parting from their spiritual offshoot \u2013 who urge the Plastic Shaman to share their gift with the rest of the world.
