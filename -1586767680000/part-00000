The 2015 result ranked the seat as the 77th safest of the party's 232 seats (by percentage majority).<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/labour-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Labour MPs elected in 2015 by % majority] UK Political.info.

The seat covers the southern half of the [[London Borough of Camden]], including all or most of [[Camden Town]], [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]], [[Gospel Oak]], [[Kentish Town]] and [[Bloomsbury]].\n\nThe constituency has contained the following wards of the London Borough of Camden:\n;1983\u20131997\nBloomsbury, Brunswick, Camden, Castlehaven, Caversham, Chalk Farm, Gospel Oak, Grafton, Holborn, King\u2019s Cross, Regent\u2019s Park, St John's, St Pancras, and Somers Town.\n;1997\u20132010\nAs above, less Gospel Oak\n;2010\u2013present\n[[Bloomsbury (ward)|Bloomsbury]], [[Camden Town with Primrose Hill (ward)|Camden Town with Primrose Hill]], [[Cantelowes (ward)|Cantelowes]], [[Gospel Oak (ward)|Gospel Oak]], [[Haverstock (ward)|Haverstock]], [[Highgate (Camden ward)|Highgate]], [[Holborn and Covent Garden (ward)|Holborn and Covent Garden]], [[Kentish Town (ward)|Kentish Town]], [[King's Cross (ward)|King's Cross]], [[Regent's Park (Camden ward)|Regent's Park]], and [[St Pancras and Somers Town (ward)|St Pancras and Somers Town]]. (Wards renamed and redrawn before 2010 election.)\n\n;Summary of boundary review\nThe [[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] by the [[Boundary Commission for England]] was implemented nationally in 2010.<ref>[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7032/7032_i.pdf Fifth Periodical Report], Boundary Commission for England, {{ISBN|0-10-170322-8}}. Contains list of boundary changes in England.</ref> Parts of Highgate, Gospel Oak, Haverstock, and Camden Town with Primrose Hill wards were transferred from the former constituency of [[Hampstead and Highgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampstead and Highgate]]. The electorate of the new seat would have been 85,188 if it had existed in that form at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]. The electorate has since risen further, and at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] it was among the five highest electorates in London.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\nThe seat was held from 1983\u20132015 by [[Frank Dobson]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who had been elected in 1979 to the predecessor seat of [[Holborn and St Pancras South (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn & St Pancras South]]. Dobson was the longest-serving Labour MP in London until he stood down in 2015. The constituency has been represented by [[Keir Starmer]] since the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], who has served as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] since [[2020 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|April 2020]].\n\n{|

Gospel Oak, particularly towards Kentish Town, has high deprivation levels, but the neighbouring [[Highgate]] ward has low deprivation levels.\n\nThe south part of the seat includes the [[University of London]] and several teaching hospitals, and so the constituency has a large student population.\n\n[[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross]], [[St Pancras railway station|St Pancras International]] and [[Euston railway station|Euston]] railway termini are in the seat.<ref name=os>{{cite web|url=http://getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/getamap/frames.htm?mapAction=gaz&gazName=g&gazString=TQ048812|title=OS Maps - online and App mapping system - Ordnance Survey Shop|website=getamap.ordnancesurvey.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 20th century the Bloomsbury, Holborn and Covent Garden, and Highgate wards overwhelmingly elected Conservative councillors. Since 2000 the wards forming the seat in its three revised forms have all swung against the party. The 2014 local government elections (for a standard four-year term) produced one [[Green Party of England and Wales|Green Party]] councillor, for the Highgate ward; the remaining 32 councillors whose wards fall within the seat (as redrawn in 2010) are members of the Labour Party.<ref>[http://directory.londoncouncils.gov.uk/directory/camden/ directory] Londoncouncils.gov.uk.  Retrieved 31-01-2017</ref>\n\n;Political history\nThe seat has been won since 1983 by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. The majorities achieved have been varied between a relatively marginal 13.9% in 2005 (making it a lowest 150 seat for the party in that year by percentage of majority) to a landslide 51.7% in 2017. The 2015 result ranked the seat as the 77th safest of the party's 232 seats (by percentage majority).<ref>[http://www.ukpolitical.info/labour-mps-elected-2015.htm List of Labour MPs elected in 2015 by % majority] UK Political.info.  Retrieved 2017-01-29</ref>\n\n==Boundaries==\n\nThe seat was created in 1983 as a primary successor to [[Holborn and St Pancras South (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn and St Pancras South]], which was created in 1950. The seat covers the southern half of the [[London Borough of Camden]], including all or most of [[Camden Town]], [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]], [[Gospel Oak]], [[Kentish Town]] and [[Bloomsbury]].\n\nThe constituency has contained the following wards of the London Borough of Camden:\n;1983\u20131997\nBloomsbury, Brunswick, Camden, Castlehaven, Caversham, Chalk Farm, Gospel Oak, Grafton, Holborn, King\u2019s Cross, Regent\u2019s Park, St John's, St Pancras, and Somers Town.\n;1997\u20132010\nAs above, less Gospel Oak\n;2010\u2013present\n[[Bloomsbury (ward)|Bloomsbury]], [[Camden Town with Primrose Hill (ward)|Camden Town with Primrose Hill]], [[Cantelowes (ward)|Cantelowes]], [[Gospel Oak (ward)|Gospel Oak]], [[Haverstock (ward)|Haverstock]], [[Highgate (Camden ward)|Highgate]], [[Holborn and Covent Garden (ward)|Holborn and Covent Garden]], [[Kentish Town (ward)|Kentish Town]], [[King's Cross (ward)|King's Cross]], [[Regent's Park (Camden ward)|Regent's Park]], and [[St Pancras and Somers Town (ward)|St Pancras and Somers Town]]. (Wards renamed and redrawn before 2010 election.)\n\n;Summary of boundary review\nThe [[Fifth Periodic Review of Westminster constituencies]] by the [[Boundary Commission for England]] was implemented nationally in 2010.<ref>[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm70/7032/7032_i.pdf Fifth Periodical Report], Boundary Commission for England, {{ISBN|0-10-170322-8}}. Contains list of boundary changes in England.</ref> Parts of Highgate, Gospel Oak, Haverstock, and Camden Town with Primrose Hill wards were transferred from the former constituency of [[Hampstead and Highgate (UK Parliament constituency)|Hampstead and Highgate]]. The electorate of the new seat would have been 85,188 if it had existed in that form at the [[2005 United Kingdom general election|2005 general election]]. The electorate has since risen further, and at the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 general election]] it was among the five highest electorates in London.\n\n==Members of Parliament==\nThe seat was held from 1983\u20132015 by [[Frank Dobson]] of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], who had been elected in 1979 to the predecessor seat of [[Holborn and St Pancras South (UK Parliament constituency)|Holborn & St Pancras South]]. Dobson was the longest-serving Labour MP in London until he stood down in 2015. The constituency has been represented by [[Keir Starmer]] since the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]], who has served as [[Leader of the Labour Party (UK)|Leader of the Labour Party]] and [[Leader of the Opposition (United Kingdom)|Leader of the Opposition]] since [[2020 Labour Party (UK) leadership election|April 2020]].\n\n{|

It was released on April 25, 1995, by [[Loud Records]]. The album features [[guest appearance]]s by [[Nas]], [[Raekwon]], [[Ghostface Killah]], and [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]], who also contributed to its production and mixing. Most of the leftover songs from the album became bonus tracks for Mobb Deep's ''[[The Infamous Mobb Deep]]'' album (2014).\n\nUpon its release, ''The Infamous'' achieved notable commercial success, debuting at number 15 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 3 on the [[Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums]] charts. On June 26, 1995, the album was certified [[Gold album|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web |last = |first = |url = https://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp |title = Gold and Platinum Database Search at Riaa.com |format = |work = |publisher = |accessdate = December 31, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061221102221/http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 21, 2006}}</ref> The album produced four singles; \"[[Shook Ones (Part II)]]\", \"[[Survival of the Fittest (song)|Survival of the Fittest]]\", \"[[Temperature's Rising (Mobb Deep song)|Temperature's Rising]]\", \"[[Give Up the Goods (Just Step)]]\"; the first three singles achieved varying degrees of chart success, with \"Shook Ones (Part II)\" being the most successful.\n\nThe album's dark, haunting style, defined by its evocative melodies, rugged beats, and lyrics dealing with crime in [[inner city]] neighborhoods, reflected the destitute side of [[New York City|New York]]'s urban landscape in a manner that received special recognition and critical praise. Along with albums such as ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', ''[[Illmatic]]'' and ''[[Ready to Die]]'', ''The Infamous'' is widely credited as a major contributor to the [[East Coast hip hop#Renaissance (1990s)|East Coast Renaissance]]. Furthermore, the album is credited with helping to redefine the sound of [[hardcore hip hop]], using its production style, which incorporated eerie piano [[loop (music)|loops]], distorted synthesizers, [[Eighth note|eighth-note]] [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]], and sparse [[low-pass filter|filtered]] basslines.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Q-Tip at Commonwealth Washington, D.C. in 2008.jpg|thumb|left|165px|[[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] played an important role in the album's production and mixing]]\nDuring the spring of 1993, while the group was still in their late teens, Mobb Deep released their first album ''[[Juvenile Hell]]'' under the [[4th & B'way Records]] label. The album included production from several revered New York-based producers, including [[Large Professor]], [[DJ Premier]], and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] affiliate Kerwin Young, and included the underground hit single \"[[Hit It from the Back]]\". Due to ''Juvenile Hell''{{'s}} failure to achieve significant commercial and critical success, the duo was dropped from their label several months after the album's release.<ref name=\"Coleman267\">Coleman, Brian, 2007. P:267</ref> [[Havoc (musician)|Havoc]] and [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] later described ''Juvenile Hell'' as a \"learning experience\".<ref name=\"Coleman267\"/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1993, [[Loud Records]] was looking for another group to sign, owing to the success of [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s first single, \"[[Protect Ya Neck]]\", and by fall 1993, the label had signed Mobb Deep.<ref name=\"Coleman267\"/> In 1994, the group released the promotional single \"[[Shook Ones (song)|Shook Ones]]\", which served as a preview of their new sound.<ref name=\"pitchfork\"/><ref name=\"complex\"/> Unlike the duo's first album, ''The Infamous'' was mostly self-produced by Havoc and Prodigy, with outside help from Loud [[artists and repertoire|A&R]] representatives Matt Life and Schott Free, as well as [[A Tribe Called Quest]] producer [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]], who discovered Mobb Deep in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"djbooth\">James, Andy.

Accessed on April 6, 2020.</ref> Matt Life later recalled Q-Tip's involvements, stating, \"Tip was very involved in ''The Infamous'' from early on. Probably more than people know. Tip was just a fan of theirs and I knew him from way back, so he was really helpful, giving them advice.\"<ref name=\"Coleman269\">Coleman, Brian, 2007.

MOOVMNT.com. Accessed on April 6, 2020.</ref>\n\nOn the group's decision to handle most of the production, Havoc later commented, \"We started producing because other producers was giving us shit that we didn't like, or they was just charging too much. I didn't know nothing about producing music at the time, but I learned by watching others.\"<ref>Coleman, Brian, 2007. P:266</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\nRecording sessions for ''The Infamous'' began in 1994 and took place at Battery Studios, Platinum Island Studios, Firehouse Studios and [[Unique Recording Studios|Unique Recording]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"pitchfork\"/><ref name=\"Huey\"/> Havoc produced most of the beats in his [[Queensbridge Houses|Queensbridge]] apartment, with Prodigy often assisting him; earlier in their career, Prodigy taught him how to [[sampling (music)|sample]].<ref name=\"complex\">{{cite web|last1=Ahmed|first1=Insanul|last2=Callahan-Bever|first2=Noah|last3=Kondo|first3=Toshitaka|title=The Making of Mobb Deep's 'The Infamous'|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/04/the-making-of-mobb-deep-the-infamous|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> Describing their minimal production setup, Prodigy said, \"Our first sampler we had was an [[Ensoniq EPS|EPS 16 plus]] &nbsp;... We had that for a little while, and when the [[Akai MPC|MPC]] came out we bought that, and that was it. A little record player, a little mixer, and that's all we needed.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\nMobb Deep initially recorded 20 songs for ''The Infamous'', but executive producers Matt Life and Schott Free worked with them to improve the music.<ref name=\"complex\"/> Matt Life recalled, \"Schott worked closely with them on how the rhymes were coming and I worked closely with them on how production was coming. The first thing that I remember is them creating a semblance of the core of the first album and me creating a rough in-house version of what the album could be and throwing a sticker on the cassette.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> The early rough version of the album contained five or six songs, including the original versions of the album's four singles. The original \"[[Temperature's Rising (Mobb Deep song)|Temperature's Rising]]\" was remade because of sample clearance issues.<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\nLater on, Q-Tip became the album's mixing engineer; Matt Life explained, \"he came in later in the sessions and said he'd help mix a couple records. And then he ended up picking a couple of records they did to re-do. Except for 'Drink Away the Pain', the songs that Tip produced were already a full song before he got to them. He liked the lyrics on those original songs, but he re-did the beats. It was the same song title, same hook, same rhymes, just new beats.\"<ref name=\"Coleman269\"/> Q-Tip also improved the [[programming (music)|drum programming]] on \"Survival of the Fittest\", \"Up North Trip\" and \"Trife Life\".<ref name=\"complex\"/> Describing his contributions as \"a totally different sound than the Tribe stuff\", Q-Tip encouraged Mobb Deep to make their dark sound stand out, by adding [[major chord]]s to their [[minor chord|minor]] [[key (music)|key]] samples.<ref name=\"complex\"/><ref name=\"redbull\">[http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/q-tip Q-Tip] [[Red Bull Music Academy]]. Accessed on April 6, 2020.</ref> Havoc later stated, \"Q-Tip definitely bent his style a little bit to get with what we was doing. Like with 'Drink Away the Pain' you see him trying to get gangsta with it.\"<ref>Coleman, Brian 2007. P:272.</ref> Schott Free summed up Q-Tip's influence:\n\n{{quote|The album was pretty tight, but once Tip comes around he hears different things. He changes [[bass drum|kicks]], [[snare drum|snares]], whatever. Also, you get to watch Havoc implement what he had already known with a cat like Tip and Tip showing him everything he knew.

It wasn't no pretty boy shit. It was like, 'Yo, let's throw on our [[The Timberland Company|Timbs]].' It didn't get more harder than that.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> On each track, they rapped about the realities of prison, murder, robbery, selling drugs and alcoholism, among other topics.<ref name=\"complex\"/> [[Big Noyd]] had a significant presence on the album, with four guest appearances; discussing the \"Just Step Prelude\", Prodigy recalled, \"That shit right there, that was a rhyme that Noyd used to kick in the projects everyday to niggas &nbsp;...

That's partly because of the cinematic vision behind the duo's detailed narratives, but it's also a tribute to how well the raw, grimy production evokes the world that Mobb Deep is depicting.\" Huey further stated:\n\n{{quote|This is hard, underground hip-hop that demands to be met on its own terms, with few melodic hooks to draw the listener in. Similarly, there's little pleasure or relief offered in the picture of the streets Mobb Deep paints here: They inhabit a war zone where crime and paranoia hang constantly in the air. Gangs are bound together by a code of fierce loyalty, relying wholly on one another for survival in a hopeless environment.

The album features [[guest appearance]]s by [[Nas]], [[Raekwon]], [[Ghostface Killah]], and [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]], who also contributed to its production and mixing. Most of the leftover songs from the album became bonus tracks for Mobb Deep's ''[[The Infamous Mobb Deep]]'' album (2014).\n\nUpon its release, ''The Infamous'' achieved notable commercial success, debuting at number 15 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 3 on the [[Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums]] charts. On June 26, 1995, the album was certified [[Gold album|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web |last = |first = |url = https://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp |title = Gold and Platinum Database Search at Riaa.com |format = |work = |publisher = |accessdate = December 31, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061221102221/http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 21, 2006}}</ref> The album produced four singles; \"[[Shook Ones (Part II)]]\", \"[[Survival of the Fittest (song)|Survival of the Fittest]]\", \"[[Temperature's Rising (Mobb Deep song)|Temperature's Rising]]\", \"[[Give Up the Goods (Just Step)]]\"; the first three singles achieved varying degrees of chart success, with \"Shook Ones (Part II)\" being the most successful.\n\nThe album's dark, haunting style, defined by its evocative melodies, rugged beats, and lyrics dealing with crime in [[inner city]] neighborhoods, reflected the destitute side of [[New York City|New York]]'s urban landscape in a manner that received special recognition and critical praise. Along with albums such as ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', ''[[Illmatic]]'' and ''[[Ready to Die]]'', ''The Infamous'' is widely credited as a major contributor to the [[East Coast hip hop#Renaissance (1990s)|East Coast Renaissance]]. Furthermore, the album is credited with helping to redefine the sound of [[hardcore hip hop]], using its production style, which incorporated eerie piano [[loop (music)|loops]], distorted synthesizers, [[Eighth note|eighth-note]] [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]], and sparse [[low-pass filter|filtered]] basslines.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Q-Tip at Commonwealth Washington, D.C. in 2008.jpg|thumb|left|165px|[[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] played an important role in the album's production and mixing]]\nDuring the spring of 1993, while the group was still in their late teens, Mobb Deep released their first album ''[[Juvenile Hell]]'' under the [[4th & B'way Records]] label. The album included production from several revered New York-based producers, including [[Large Professor]], [[DJ Premier]], and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] affiliate Kerwin Young, and included the underground hit single \"[[Hit It from the Back]]\". Due to ''Juvenile Hell''{{'s}} failure to achieve significant commercial and critical success, the duo was dropped from their label several months after the album's release.<ref name=\"Coleman267\">Coleman, Brian, 2007.

Accessed on April 6, 2020.</ref> Matt Life later recalled Q-Tip's involvements, stating, \"Tip was very involved in ''The Infamous'' from early on. Probably more than people know. Tip was just a fan of theirs and I knew him from way back, so he was really helpful, giving them advice.\"<ref name=\"Coleman269\">Coleman, Brian, 2007.

Accessed on April 6, 2020.</ref>\n\nOn the group's decision to handle most of the production, Havoc later commented, \"We started producing because other producers was giving us shit that we didn't like, or they was just charging too much. I didn't know nothing about producing music at the time, but I learned by watching others.\"<ref>Coleman, Brian, 2007. P:266</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\nRecording sessions for ''The Infamous'' began in 1994 and took place at Battery Studios, Platinum Island Studios, Firehouse Studios and [[Unique Recording Studios|Unique Recording]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"pitchfork\"/><ref name=\"Huey\"/> Havoc produced most of the beats in his [[Queensbridge Houses|Queensbridge]] apartment, with Prodigy often assisting him; earlier in their career, Prodigy taught him how to [[sampling (music)|sample]].<ref name=\"complex\">{{cite web|last1=Ahmed|first1=Insanul|last2=Callahan-Bever|first2=Noah|last3=Kondo|first3=Toshitaka|title=The Making of Mobb Deep's 'The Infamous'|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/04/the-making-of-mobb-deep-the-infamous|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> Describing their minimal production setup, Prodigy said, \"Our first sampler we had was an [[Ensoniq EPS|EPS 16 plus]] &nbsp;... We had that for a little while, and when the [[Akai MPC|MPC]] came out we bought that, and that was it. A little record player, a little mixer, and that's all we needed.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\nMobb Deep initially recorded 20 songs for ''The Infamous'', but executive producers Matt Life and Schott Free worked with them to improve the music.<ref name=\"complex\"/> Matt Life recalled, \"Schott worked closely with them on how the rhymes were coming and I worked closely with them on how production was coming. The first thing that I remember is them creating a semblance of the core of the first album and me creating a rough in-house version of what the album could be and throwing a sticker on the cassette.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> The early rough version of the album contained five or six songs, including the original versions of the album's four singles. The original \"[[Temperature's Rising (Mobb Deep song)|Temperature's Rising]]\" was remade because of sample clearance issues.<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\nLater on, Q-Tip became the album's mixing engineer; Matt Life explained, \"he came in later in the sessions and said he'd help mix a couple records. And then he ended up picking a couple of records they did to re-do. Except for 'Drink Away the Pain', the songs that Tip produced were already a full song before he got to them. He liked the lyrics on those original songs, but he re-did the beats. It was the same song title, same hook, same rhymes, just new beats.\"<ref name=\"Coleman269\"/> Q-Tip also improved the [[programming (music)|drum programming]] on \"Survival of the Fittest\", \"Up North Trip\" and \"Trife Life\".<ref name=\"complex\"/> Describing his contributions as \"a totally different sound than the Tribe stuff\", Q-Tip encouraged Mobb Deep to make their dark sound stand out, by adding [[major chord]]s to their [[minor chord|minor]] [[key (music)|key]] samples.<ref name=\"complex\"/><ref name=\"redbull\">[http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/q-tip Q-Tip] [[Red Bull Music Academy]]. Accessed on April 6, 2020.</ref> Havoc later stated, \"Q-Tip definitely bent his style a little bit to get with what we was doing. Like with 'Drink Away the Pain' you see him trying to get gangsta with it.\"<ref>Coleman, Brian 2007. P:272.</ref> Schott Free summed up Q-Tip's influence:\n\n{{quote|The album was pretty tight, but once Tip comes around he hears different things. He changes [[bass drum|kicks]], [[snare drum|snares]], whatever. Also, you get to watch Havoc implement what he had already known with a cat like Tip and Tip showing him everything he knew. Showing him a format, a formula, and even how to double on the kicks. It's just kinda ill how he just came in and just cleaned it up. His influence is mostly sonically. Playing any of those records in the club, the drums and everything is big. Tip was always a master of making a record sound huge.<ref name=\"complex\"/>}}\n\nLyrically, Mobb Deep added to the album's dark aesthetic.<ref name=\"Huey\"/> Speaking on his verse on \"Survival of the Fittest\", Havoc explained, \"We were just straight hood. It wasn't no pretty boy shit. It was like, 'Yo, let's throw on our [[The Timberland Company|Timbs]].' It didn't get more harder than that.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> On each track, they rapped about the realities of prison, murder, robbery, selling drugs and alcoholism, among other topics.<ref name=\"complex\"/> [[Big Noyd]] had a significant presence on the album, with four guest appearances; discussing the \"Just Step Prelude\", Prodigy recalled, \"That shit right there, that was a rhyme that Noyd used to kick in the projects everyday to niggas &nbsp;... He'd spit that shit that had the whole block going crazy.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> Big Noyd initially preferred to sell drugs and had no desire to be a rapper, until the group convinced him otherwise.<ref name=\"complex\"/> The remaining guest appearances happened in various ways; [[Nas]] was a childhood friend of Havoc, [[Raekwon]] and [[Ghostface Killah]] of Wu-Tang Clan were Mobb Deep's labelmates and [[Crystal Johnson (singer)|Crystal Johnson]] was an associate of Q-Tip.<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\n==Cover artwork==\nThe cover art for ''The Infamous'' was created in Queensbridge Houses, New York by photographer [[Delphine Fawundu|Delphine A.

It just felt so powerful and it was all happening right before my eyes, and my camera\". In 2019, images from Fawundu's photoshoot with Mobb Deep and the previously unseen contact prints were featured in a full-size museum exhibit at [[The Annenberg Space for Photography]] in Los Angeles.<ref>https://www.contacthighproject.com/blog/delphine-fawundu-on-photographing-the-infamous-mobb-deep</ref><ref>https://allhiphop.com/features/book-review-contact-high-a-visual-history-of-hip-hop-aVwNiEUMrEKfgV1hIMccug/</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Commercial performance===\nThe album spent 18 weeks on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at number 15, and it also spent 34 weeks on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts, peaking at number 3.

Similarly, there's little pleasure or relief offered in the picture of the streets Mobb Deep paints here: They inhabit a war zone where crime and paranoia hang constantly in the air. Gangs are bound together by a code of fierce loyalty, relying wholly on one another for survival in a hopeless environment.

It is planned to be cleared as part of the [[Hambach surface mine]] by owner [[RWE AG]]. There have been ongoing protests and occupations to prevent this since 2012.\n\n[[File:Cut forest digger in bkgrd.jpg|thumb|Area of destroyed forest with excavator]]\n[[File:Hambach surface mine and Hambach Forest.png|thumb|[[Hambach surface mine]] ({{color|gray}}); remaining '''Hambach Forest''' in the south (NE of Morschenich ([[:de:Morschenich|de]])); recultivated [[Sophienh\u00f6he]] in NW, 2017<ref name=\"Map_2017\"/>]]\n\n== The forest ==\n[[File:Myotis_bechsteinii-flying1.jpg|thumb|Hambach Forest's rare [[Bechstein's bat]] population is threatened.]]\nHambach Forest is rich in biodiversity and home to 142 species regarded as important for conservation.\nThe forest has been called ''\"the last remnant of a sylvan ecosystem that has occupied this part of the Rhine River plain between Aachen and Cologne since the end of the last ice age\"''.<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/> Only ten percent of Hambach Forest still remains, and the remaining forest is severely threatened by mining for brown coal.<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/> Of special interest is the rare [[Bechstein's bat]] population, which is strictly protected according to annex II and annex IV of the European [[Habitats Directive]].<ref name=\"BAT_2018\"/>\nAn [[Environmental Impact Assessment]] study has never been conducted. The {{ill|Administrative Court Cologne{{!}}Administrative Court|de|Verwaltungsgericht K\u00f6ln}} in [[Cologne]] denied the necessity of such a study in November 2017 because the permission for the mining operations was given in the 1970s, long before Environmental Impact Assessment studies became mandatory.<ref name=\"VGK\u00f6ln_2017\"/><ref name=\"RegArnsberg_2018\"/>\n\n[[File:Rheinisches Braunkohlerevier DE.png|thumb|Lignite mining in the area, as of 2018. [[Hambach surface mine|Hambach pit mine]] is left of center.]]\n\n== Lignite mining ==\n{{main|Hambach surface mine}}\nThe area is part of the ''Rhenish Lignite Mining Area'' ({{lang-de|Rheinisches Braunkohlerevier}} ([[:de:Rheinisches Braunkohlerevier|de]])), and the [[Hambach surface mine]] is the largest open pit mine in Germany, as of 2018. [[RWE AG]] has owned the land since the 1960s or earlier and has held an official permit to clear forests in the area since the 1970s. The company has repeatedly argued that Hambach Forest must be cleared to ensure future energy supply. RWE spokesperson Guido Steffen states \u201cI\u2019ve known Hambach for decades, before the mine. It was a great forest ... It\u2019s a pity it must be logged. We\u2019re not doing this because we have fun logging trees, but out of economic necessity. Germany needs energy.\u201d<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/> \n\nThe usual process is to excavate the lignite/brown coal beneath it with huge excavator machines and then burn it in [[steam-electric power generation]]. The 2018 map to the right shows the extent of excavation activities until then. On this map, Hambach Forest (around abandoned old Morschenich) is not displayed at all, but under a hatching meaning \"future area of operations\".\n\n== First occupations by environmentalists (2012\u20132014) ==\nSince 2012, Hambach Forest has been a political standpoint for environmentalists who are protesting against the German energy company [[RWE AG]] because of the open-pit [[Hambach surface mine]] neighboring the site. At 33 square miles, the mine is the largest of its kind in Europe.<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/><ref name=\"DW_2016\"/>\n\nAn area within the forest was occupied by those opposing the clearance for lignite extraction. They sought to close the mine and save the remaining sections of the forest which are under threat of being cut down to allow the expansion of the mine.\n\nThe first occupation lasted from April to November 2012. A second occupation started in September 2013 and lasted until March 2014, followed by a third occupation from April to October 2014.{{r|rep}}\n\n[[File:Hangingbarricade (27065382544).jpg|thumb|Barricade (September 2016)]]\n\n== Fourth occupation (2015\u20132018) ==\nThe fourth occupation period started in 2015<!-- some sources state 2014 --> and lasted until 2018. It involved a settlement with around two dozen [[tree house]]s and numerous [[road barricade]]s. The barricades were erected to prevent mining company and police vehicles from entering.<ref name=\"rep\"/>\n\n=== BUND lawsuit and court order ===\nCutting seasons last from 1 October until the end of February and usually 70-80 [[hectare]]s are cleared in each period. The tree cutting operations in the 2017/2018 cutting season ended after just two days in November 2017, after the {{ill|Higher Administrative Court North-Rhine Westphalia{{!}}Higher Administrative Court|de|Oberverwaltungsgericht f\u00fcr das Land Nordrhein-Westfalen}} in [[M\u00fcnster]] ordered a halt. According to [[BUND]], the environmental protection association that filed the corresponding lawsuit, Hambach Forest, with its [[Quercus robur|common oak]], [[hornbeam]] and [[lily of the valley]] populations, is a habitat of type 9160 of annex I of the European [[Habitats Directive]] (Council Directive 92/43/EEC of 21 May 1992).<ref name=\"Bund_2017\"/>\nOf special interest in this lawsuit was the [[Bechstein's bat]], which is strictly protected according to annex II and annex IV of the European [[Habitats Directive]].<ref name=\"BAT_2018\"/>\n\n=== Arrests of activists (spring of 2018) ===\n[[File:Gemeinsam stark,Hambacher Forst,NRW.jpg|thumb|Colony of tree houses in Hambach Forest (February 2018)]]\nOn 22 January 2018, nine Hambach Forest activists were arrested for resisting a barricade eviction.

She had been arrested on 19 March one week after her arrival after she had been part of a group out of which firecrackers were thrown in the direction of police officers.<ref name=\"Gego_2019\"/>\nShe decided not to give any personal details and tried to stay anonymously.<ref name=\"Gego_2019\"/> As a consequence she had been taken into pretrial detention (as \"Unknown Person III\" [UP III]), denying herself the chance to take her already booked flight back home to Australia one week later.<ref name=\"Gego_2019\"/> According to the prosecutor she was identified one day before her trial which took place on 31 July 2018.<ref name=\"Gego_2019\"/> She has been sentenced to 9 months in prison without parole.<ref name=\"Gego_2019\"/>\nAfter a court hearing on 4 October she has been released.<ref name=\"Gego_2019\"/>\n\n[[File:Barrikaden in der B\u00fcrge.jpg|thumb|Newly erected barricades (September 2018)]]\n\n=== Police clearing the tree houses (September 2018) ===\n{{See also|:de:R\u00e4umung des Hambacher Forsts 2018{{!}}Eviction of Hambach Forest 2018&nbsp;(German)}}\nOn 13 September 2018 a large scale police operation started initiated by North Rhine-Westphalian Ministry of Construction to evict more than fifty tree houses which existed for up to six years because they didn't comply with fire safety regulation standards.\nTo protect life and limb of the tree house occupants was announced as an important goal of the operation.<ref name=\"AF_2018\"/>\n\n=== Journalist falls and dies ===\nAs evictions continued, on 19 September 2018, the 27-year old artist, blogger and journalist Steffen Meyn fell through a [[Canopy walkway|walkway]] of 15 meters height in the treehouse village of Beechtown and died. Meyn was working on a long-time documentary project of the activities in the Hambach Forest. Immediate resuscitation efforts failed.<ref name=\"taz_2018\"/> \n\nThe eviction of tree houses was  stopped immediately after that incident by [[Herbert Reul]], North Rhine-Westphalia's interior minister. He said \"We cannot just proceed as normal \u2014 at least I can't.\"<ref name=\"Wecker_2018\"/>\n\nThe eviction proceedings resumed on 23 September 2018.

On this map, Hambach Forest (around abandoned old Morschenich) is not displayed at all, but under a hatching meaning \"future area of operations\".\n\n== First occupations by environmentalists (2012\u20132014) ==\nSince 2012, Hambach Forest has been a political standpoint for environmentalists who are protesting against the German energy company [[RWE AG]] because of the open-pit [[Hambach surface mine]] neighboring the site. At 33 square miles, the mine is the largest of its kind in Europe.<ref name=\"Doomed_2018\"/><ref name=\"DW_2016\"/>\n\nAn area within the forest was occupied by those opposing the clearance for lignite extraction. They sought to close the mine and save the remaining sections of the forest which are under threat of being cut down to allow the expansion of the mine.\n\nThe first occupation lasted from April to November 2012. A second occupation started in September 2013 and lasted until March 2014, followed by a third occupation from April to October 2014.{{r|rep}}\n\n[[File:Hangingbarricade (27065382544).jpg|thumb|Barricade (September 2016)]]\n\n== Fourth occupation (2015\u20132018) ==\nThe fourth occupation period started in 2015<!-- some sources state 2014 --> and lasted until 2018.

In the 1970s, French people were consuming an average of one loaf of bread per day. Only a century ago, the French ate approximately 3 loaves of bread per day. Today, French people eat only a half a loaf of bread per day. In response to this decline, bakers have created a national campaign to get people to call at the bakery before and after work just as they used to. The campaign models the American \"Got Milk?\" campaign, plastering \"Hey there, have you picked up the bread?\" all over billboards and bread bags.<ref>Kim, Eun Kyung (6 August 2013) [http://www.today.com/news/mon-dieu-new-campaign-urges-french-eat-more-bread-6C10855685 Mon dieu!

By supplying a sufficient amount of bread to the people, the government was able to demonstrate its strong political fitness. Wheaten bread was also thought to be indispensable to one's well-being after French medical chemists had associated gluten with several nourishing elements in plants. As bread had a high gluten content compared to other cereals, it was given a reputation of being the alimentary ideal. Consequently, consumers became extremely concerned with the quality of their wheaten bread, resulting in a meticulous surveillance of wheaten bread production; they did not want their bread to contain filler additives such as bran, rye, barley, and legume flour. At the time, bread was the most sought out food as it was considered to be essential, universal, and highly nutritive. It was typical for the average French citizen to believe that it was impossible to overindulge in bread. For many, bread became the centerpiece of every meal. All other foods such as fruits, vegetables, and meats were thought as subsidiary, or ancillary to nourishment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spary|first1=Emma|title=Feeding France: New Sciences of Food, 1760\u20131815|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107031050|pages=55\u201368}}</ref>\n\nThere is a wide variety of traditional breads in [[Great Britain]], often baked in a rectangular tin form.

There are many variations on bread rolls, such as [[bap (bread)|bap]]s, [[barm]]s, [[breadcake]]s and so on. The [[Chorleywood process]] for mass-producing bread was developed in England in the 1960s before spreading worldwide.

One can buy it freshly made every morning in the traditional bakeries, where there is a large assortment of bread.

Rolls, made from wheat flour and yeast, are another popular and traditional bread, eaten with the dinner meal.\n\n[[Cornbread]] is made from cornmeal and can differ significantly in taste and texture from region to region. In general, the [[Southern United States|South]] prefers white cornmeal with little to no wheat flour or sweeteners added; it is traditionally baked in a cast-iron skillet and ideally has a crunchy outside and moist inside. The [[Northern United States|North]] usually prefers yellow cornmeal with sometimes as much as half wheat flour in its composition, as well as sugar, honey, or maple syrup. This results in a bread that is softer and sweeter than its southern counterpart. Wheat flour was not available to the average North American family until the early 1900s when a new breed of wheat termed [[Red Fife wheat|Marquis]] was produced. This was a hybrid of Red Fife and [[Hard red winter wheat]]. Marquis grew well and soon average Americans were able to have homemade wheat bread on the table.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Solomon|title=Charles Scribner's Sons,|publisher=Gale|location=New York|pages=531|edition=Vol 3}}</ref> Homemade wheat breads are made in a rectangular tin similar to those in the United Kingdom.\n\nSpoon bread, also called batter bread or egg bread, is made of cornmeal with or without added rice and hominy, and is mixed with milk, eggs, shortening and leavening to such a consistency that it must be served from the baking dish with a spoon. This is popular chiefly in the South.\n\nSourdough biscuits are traditional \"cowboy food\" in the [[Western United States|West]]. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is known for its crusty [[sourdough]].\n\nUp until the 20th century (and even later in certain regions), any flour other than cornmeal was considered a luxury; this would explain the greater variety in cornbread types compared to that of wheat breads. In terms of commercial manufacture, the most popular bread has been a soft-textured type with a thin crust that is usually made with milk and is slightly sweet; this is the type that is generally sold ready-sliced in packages. It is usually eaten with the crust, but some eaters or preparers may remove the crust due to a personal preference or style of serving, as with finger sandwiches served with [[afternoon tea]]. Some of the softest bread, including [[Wonder Bread]], is referred to as \"balloon bread\".\n\nThough white \"[[sandwich bread]]\" is the most popular, Americans are trending toward more [[artisanal]] breads. Different regions of the country feature certain ethnic bread varieties including the Ashkenazi Jewish [[bagel]], the French [[baguette]], the Italian-style [[scali bread]] made in [[New England]], Jewish rye, commonly associated with [[delicatessen]] cuisine, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[frybread]] (a product of hardship, developed during the Indian resettlements of the 19th century).\n\n== Religious significance ==\n[[File:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Eucharist]] (also called Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper) is considered a sacrament, ordinance, or equivalent in most Christian denominations.]]\n{{see also|Baking#Cultural and religious significance}}\n\n===Abrahamic religions===\n\nBread has symbolic roles in the [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].

In the 1970s, French people were consuming an average of one loaf of bread per day. Only a century ago, the French ate approximately 3 loaves of bread per day. Today, French people eat only a half a loaf of bread per day. In response to this decline, bakers have created a national campaign to get people to call at the bakery before and after work just as they used to. The campaign models the American \"Got Milk?\" campaign, plastering \"Hey there, have you picked up the bread?\" all over billboards and bread bags.<ref>Kim, Eun Kyung (6 August 2013) [http://www.today.com/news/mon-dieu-new-campaign-urges-french-eat-more-bread-6C10855685 Mon dieu!

By supplying a sufficient amount of bread to the people, the government was able to demonstrate its strong political fitness. Wheaten bread was also thought to be indispensable to one's well-being after French medical chemists had associated gluten with several nourishing elements in plants. As bread had a high gluten content compared to other cereals, it was given a reputation of being the alimentary ideal. Consequently, consumers became extremely concerned with the quality of their wheaten bread, resulting in a meticulous surveillance of wheaten bread production; they did not want their bread to contain filler additives such as bran, rye, barley, and legume flour. At the time, bread was the most sought out food as it was considered to be essential, universal, and highly nutritive. It was typical for the average French citizen to believe that it was impossible to overindulge in bread. For many, bread became the centerpiece of every meal. All other foods such as fruits, vegetables, and meats were thought as subsidiary, or ancillary to nourishment.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Spary|first1=Emma|title=Feeding France: New Sciences of Food, 1760\u20131815|date=2014|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107031050|pages=55\u201368}}</ref>\n\nThere is a wide variety of traditional breads in [[Great Britain]], often baked in a rectangular tin form.

There are many variations on bread rolls, such as [[bap (bread)|bap]]s, [[barm]]s, [[breadcake]]s and so on. The [[Chorleywood process]] for mass-producing bread was developed in England in the 1960s before spreading worldwide. Mass-produced sliced white bread brands such as [[Wonderloaf]] and [[Mother's Pride]] have been criticized on grounds of poor nutritional value and taste of the loaves produced.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-13670278 Chorleywood, the Bread that Changed Britain].

One can buy it freshly made every morning in the traditional bakeries, where there is a large assortment of bread. A smaller version is known as [[bocadillo]], an iconic piece of the Hispanic cuisine. In Spain, especially in the Mediterranean area, there have been guilds of bakers for over 750 years.

Rolls, made from wheat flour and yeast, are another popular and traditional bread, eaten with the dinner meal.\n\n[[Cornbread]] is made from cornmeal and can differ significantly in taste and texture from region to region. In general, the [[Southern United States|South]] prefers white cornmeal with little to no wheat flour or sweeteners added; it is traditionally baked in a cast-iron skillet and ideally has a crunchy outside and moist inside. The [[Northern United States|North]] usually prefers yellow cornmeal with sometimes as much as half wheat flour in its composition, as well as sugar, honey, or maple syrup. This results in a bread that is softer and sweeter than its southern counterpart. Wheat flour was not available to the average North American family until the early 1900s when a new breed of wheat termed [[Red Fife wheat|Marquis]] was produced. This was a hybrid of Red Fife and [[Hard red winter wheat]]. Marquis grew well and soon average Americans were able to have homemade wheat bread on the table.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Katz|first1=Solomon|title=Charles Scribner's Sons,|publisher=Gale|location=New York|pages=531|edition=Vol 3}}</ref> Homemade wheat breads are made in a rectangular tin similar to those in the United Kingdom.\n\nSpoon bread, also called batter bread or egg bread, is made of cornmeal with or without added rice and hominy, and is mixed with milk, eggs, shortening and leavening to such a consistency that it must be served from the baking dish with a spoon. This is popular chiefly in the South.\n\nSourdough biscuits are traditional \"cowboy food\" in the [[Western United States|West]]. The [[San Francisco Bay Area]] is known for its crusty [[sourdough]].\n\nUp until the 20th century (and even later in certain regions), any flour other than cornmeal was considered a luxury; this would explain the greater variety in cornbread types compared to that of wheat breads. In terms of commercial manufacture, the most popular bread has been a soft-textured type with a thin crust that is usually made with milk and is slightly sweet; this is the type that is generally sold ready-sliced in packages. It is usually eaten with the crust, but some eaters or preparers may remove the crust due to a personal preference or style of serving, as with finger sandwiches served with [[afternoon tea]]. Some of the softest bread, including [[Wonder Bread]], is referred to as \"balloon bread\".\n\nThough white \"[[sandwich bread]]\" is the most popular, Americans are trending toward more [[artisanal]] breads. Different regions of the country feature certain ethnic bread varieties including the Ashkenazi Jewish [[bagel]], the French [[baguette]], the Italian-style [[scali bread]] made in [[New England]], Jewish rye, commonly associated with [[delicatessen]] cuisine, and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[frybread]] (a product of hardship, developed during the Indian resettlements of the 19th century).\n\n== Religious significance ==\n[[File:Methodistcommunion6.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Eucharist]] (also called Holy Communion or the Lord's Supper) is considered a sacrament, ordinance, or equivalent in most Christian denominations.]]\n{{see also|Baking#Cultural and religious significance}}\n\n===Abrahamic religions===\n\nBread has symbolic roles in the [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]].

While her magical power with Peng has been weakening, Chalan has started to have the magical power leading to her confusion - who is the one for her.

However, the court did not find ReDigi's argument persuasive. Instead, the court reasoned that the plain text of the Copyright Act made it clear that a copyright holder's right of reproduction is infringed \"when a copyrighted work is fixed in a new ''material object''.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court referred to the definition of \"sound recordings\" under Section 106(1) of the Copyright Act, which are \"works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nThe court distinguished \"sound recordings\" from \"phonorecords,\" which are the \"''material objects'' in which sounds . . . are fixed by any method now known or later developed\" (emphasis in original).<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court reasoned that the reproduction right \"is the exclusive right to embody, and to prevent others from embodying, the copyrighted work (or sound recording) in a new material object[.]\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> Because it is physically impossible to transfer the original material object over the internet, \"the embodiment of a digital music file on a new hard disk is a reproduction within the meaning of the Copyright Act.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court held that reproduction occurs regardless even if the sound recording is being simultaneously deleted from the original material object, because the dictionary definition of \"reproduction\" includes \"to cause to exist . . . anew,\" not just to cause another existence.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court explained that, \"the fact that a file has moved from one material object [the user's computer] to another [the ReDigi server] means that a reproduction has occurred.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nThe court distinguished this case from cases where chemicals were used to lift images off greeting cards and placed on plaques for resale, because no new material object was created in a chemical lifting. The court explained that, in those cases, the original copyright print was physically lifted off and transferred to a ceramic tile, and no new material object was therefore created.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n===Infringement of Capitol's Distribution Rights===\nReDigi did not dispute that distribution of Capitol's works occurred on its website, only that such distributions were protected by [[fair use]] and [[first-sale doctrine|first sale]] (discussed below).<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n===Infringement of Capitol's Performance and Display Rights===\nCapitol alleged ReDigi infringed its exclusive rights because of streaming thirty-second song clips and displaying album art to potential buyers, but ReDigi countered that it acted within a licensing agreement by promptly redirecting users from the preview clips to a different source. Because there was not enough evidence on the record, the court denied Capitol's claim of performance and display rights infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n===ReDigi's Affirmative Defenses===\nBecause the court held that ReDigi legally infringed Capitol's exclusive rights of reproduction and distribution, ReDigi's only way of avoiding liability was through an [[affirmative defense]]. The court rejected all of ReDigi's defense arguments, which involved the first sale and fair use doctrines.\n\n====First-Sale Doctrine Defense====\nThe [[first-sale]] defense is a common law principle derived from ''[[Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus]]'' (1908) and codified in Section 109(a) of the Copyright Act. The first-sale doctrine provides that a copyright owner \"exhausts his exclusive statutory right to control its distribution\" once he or she has sold the copyrighted item.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> In ''ReDigi'', the court held that the first-sale defense did not apply to ReDigi because first-sale only affects the copyright holder's distribution right, not reproduction right. Since ReDigi was held to have violated Capitol's reproduction right, the court reasoned that the first-sale defense did not protect ReDigi from liability for unauthorized reproduction.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nMoreover, because ReDigi was not distributing a user's original phonorecord, but rather transmitting a new embodiment of the sound recording \"reproduced\" from the user's hard drive, the court found that ReDigi could not claim the first-sale defense. The court explained that, \"[h]ere, a ReDigi user owns the phonorecord that was created when she purchased and downloaded a song from iTunes to her hard disk. But to sell that song on ReDigi, she must produce a new phonorecord on the ReDigi server. Because it is therefore impossible for the user to sell her \u201cparticular\u201d phonorecord on ReDigi, the first-sale statute cannot provide a defense.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nIn addition, ReDigi argued that \"technological change has rendered its literal terms ambiguous, the Copyright Act must be construed in light of [its] basic purpose,\" which is designed to \"promot[e] broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court found this argument unpersuasive, reasoning that \"while technological change may have rendered Section 109(a) unsatisfactory to many contemporary observers and consumers, it has not rendered it ambiguous.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> As part of its reasoning, the court looked to a report by the [[U.S. Copyright Office]], which declined to extend first-sale protection to the distribution of digital works, because digital works compete perfectly with original copies, whereas physical copies \"degrade with time and use, making used copies less desirable than new ones.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court ultimately deferred to Congress, stating that \"[i]t is left to Congress, and not this Court, to deem [first-sale's applicability to digital works] outmoded.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n====Fair Use Doctrine Defense====\nThe court held that ReDigi's use of Capitol's works was \"well outside the fair use defense.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The four fair use factors are:\n# The ''purpose and character'' of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n# The ''nature of the copyrighted work'';\n# The ''amount and substantiality'' of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; ''and''\n# The ''effect of the use upon the potential market'' for or value of the copyrighted work.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\nBalancing each of these factors, the court held that each weighed against ReDigi (''See'' [[17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107|fair use]]). Particular judgments on each of the four factors are outlined below:\n\n'''1. Purpose and Character of Use'''\n\nAs for the first factor, the court held that \"[p]lainly, the upload, sale, and download of digital music files . . . does nothing to 'add something new, with a further purpose or different character' to the copyrighted works.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n'''2. Nature of the Copyrighted Work'''\n\nAs for the second factor, the court held that creative works such as sound recordings are \"close to the core of the intended copyright protection.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n'''3. Portion of the Work Copied'''\n\nIn terms of the third factor, the court explained that ReDigi's business depended on transmitting works in their entirety, \"negating any claim of fair use.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> (''But see'' ''[[Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley]]'', holding that the reproduction of an entire Grateful Dead poster in a book was fair use despite the appropriation of the entire work).\n\n'''4. Effect Upon the Potential Market'''\n\nAs for the fourth fair use factor, the court held that ReDigi's sales were likely to undercut the market or value of Capitol's works, because the products sold on ReDigi's market were indistinguishable from \"legitimate primary market save for its lower price.\" <ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n===Liability Analysis===\nAfter determining that infringement had occurred, the court addressed [[legal liability|liability]] separately.\n\n====Direct Infringement====\nThe court held ReDigi directly liable for infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> Direct liability requires that a defendant must have \"engaged in some volitional conduct\" showing active violation of the plaintiff's copyright.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court reasoned that since ReDigi created a system where the only music files eligible for sale were copyrighted and purchased from iTunes, and that ReDigi programmed its software to do so, there was enough of a volitional act for ReDigi to be held for direct infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n====Contributory Infringement====\nIn contrast to direct infringement, \"[c]ontributory infringement occurs where 'one . . . with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another.'\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court had \"little difficulty\" in holding that ReDigi knew or should have known its business would encourage infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> Moreover, because it found ReDigi contributorily liable, the court did not reach Capitol's inducement claim.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nThe court cited evidence from ReDigi's website, including advertisements that its service was legal, despite other published materials which warned otherwise.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> ReDigi also claimed to have researched the law on this issue, arguing that such research helped it understand whether its service would result in infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nReasoning that ReDigi provided the \"site and facilities\" for direct infringement, the court also held ReDigi materially contributed to its users' infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n=====''Sony Betamax'' Defense=====\nThe court also held that ReDigi's service did not qualify for the [[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.|Sony safe harbor]], because according to the ''Sony'' case, a service or product must be \"capable of substantial noninfringing uses,\" and ReDigi's service may only be used to infringe copyrighted works.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n====Vicarious Infringement====\nVicarious liability for copyright infringement exists where the defendant \"has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and also has a direct financial interest in such activities.\"<ref name=\"9th Circuit Opinion\">''[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/239/239.F3d.1004.00-16403.00-16401.html A&M Records, Inc. v.

However, the court did not find ReDigi's argument persuasive. Instead, the court reasoned that the plain text of the Copyright Act made it clear that a copyright holder's right of reproduction is infringed \"when a copyrighted work is fixed in a new ''material object''.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court referred to the definition of \"sound recordings\" under Section 106(1) of the Copyright Act, which are \"works that result from the fixation of a series of musical, spoken, or other sounds.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nThe court distinguished \"sound recordings\" from \"phonorecords,\" which are the \"''material objects'' in which sounds . . . are fixed by any method now known or later developed\" (emphasis in original).<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court reasoned that the reproduction right \"is the exclusive right to embody, and to prevent others from embodying, the copyrighted work (or sound recording) in a new material object[.]\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> Because it is physically impossible to transfer the original material object over the internet, \"the embodiment of a digital music file on a new hard disk is a reproduction within the meaning of the Copyright Act.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court held that reproduction occurs regardless even if the sound recording is being simultaneously deleted from the original material object, because the dictionary definition of \"reproduction\" includes \"to cause to exist . . . anew,\" not just to cause another existence.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court explained that, \"the fact that a file has moved from one material object [the user's computer] to another [the ReDigi server] means that a reproduction has occurred.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nThe court distinguished this case from cases where chemicals were used to lift images off greeting cards and placed on plaques for resale, because no new material object was created in a chemical lifting. The court explained that, in those cases, the original copyright print was physically lifted off and transferred to a ceramic tile, and no new material object was therefore created.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n===Infringement of Capitol's Distribution Rights===\nReDigi did not dispute that distribution of Capitol's works occurred on its website, only that such distributions were protected by [[fair use]] and [[first-sale doctrine|first sale]] (discussed below).<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n===Infringement of Capitol's Performance and Display Rights===\nCapitol alleged ReDigi infringed its exclusive rights because of streaming thirty-second song clips and displaying album art to potential buyers, but ReDigi countered that it acted within a licensing agreement by promptly redirecting users from the preview clips to a different source. Because there was not enough evidence on the record, the court denied Capitol's claim of performance and display rights infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n===ReDigi's Affirmative Defenses===\nBecause the court held that ReDigi legally infringed Capitol's exclusive rights of reproduction and distribution, ReDigi's only way of avoiding liability was through an [[affirmative defense]]. The court rejected all of ReDigi's defense arguments, which involved the first sale and fair use doctrines.\n\n====First-Sale Doctrine Defense====\nThe [[first-sale]] defense is a common law principle derived from ''[[Bobbs-Merrill Co. v. Straus]]'' (1908) and codified in Section 109(a) of the Copyright Act. The first-sale doctrine provides that a copyright owner \"exhausts his exclusive statutory right to control its distribution\" once he or she has sold the copyrighted item.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> In ''ReDigi'', the court held that the first-sale defense did not apply to ReDigi because first-sale only affects the copyright holder's distribution right, not reproduction right. Since ReDigi was held to have violated Capitol's reproduction right, the court reasoned that the first-sale defense did not protect ReDigi from liability for unauthorized reproduction.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nMoreover, because ReDigi was not distributing a user's original phonorecord, but rather transmitting a new embodiment of the sound recording \"reproduced\" from the user's hard drive, the court found that ReDigi could not claim the first-sale defense. The court explained that, \"[h]ere, a ReDigi user owns the phonorecord that was created when she purchased and downloaded a song from iTunes to her hard disk. But to sell that song on ReDigi, she must produce a new phonorecord on the ReDigi server. Because it is therefore impossible for the user to sell her \u201cparticular\u201d phonorecord on ReDigi, the first-sale statute cannot provide a defense.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nIn addition, ReDigi argued that \"technological change has rendered its literal terms ambiguous, the Copyright Act must be construed in light of [its] basic purpose,\" which is designed to \"promot[e] broad public availability of literature, music, and the other arts.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court found this argument unpersuasive, reasoning that \"while technological change may have rendered Section 109(a) unsatisfactory to many contemporary observers and consumers, it has not rendered it ambiguous.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> As part of its reasoning, the court looked to a report by the [[U.S. Copyright Office]], which declined to extend first-sale protection to the distribution of digital works, because digital works compete perfectly with original copies, whereas physical copies \"degrade with time and use, making used copies less desirable than new ones.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court ultimately deferred to Congress, stating that \"[i]t is left to Congress, and not this Court, to deem [first-sale's applicability to digital works] outmoded.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n====Fair Use Doctrine Defense====\nThe court held that ReDigi's use of Capitol's works was \"well outside the fair use defense.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The four fair use factors are:\n# The ''purpose and character'' of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;\n# The ''nature of the copyrighted work'';\n# The ''amount and substantiality'' of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; ''and''\n# The ''effect of the use upon the potential market'' for or value of the copyrighted work.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\nBalancing each of these factors, the court held that each weighed against ReDigi (''See'' [[17 U.S.C. \u00a7 107|fair use]]). Particular judgments on each of the four factors are outlined below:\n\n'''1. Purpose and Character of Use'''\n\nAs for the first factor, the court held that \"[p]lainly, the upload, sale, and download of digital music files . . . does nothing to 'add something new, with a further purpose or different character' to the copyrighted works.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n'''2. Nature of the Copyrighted Work'''\n\nAs for the second factor, the court held that creative works such as sound recordings are \"close to the core of the intended copyright protection.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n'''3. Portion of the Work Copied'''\n\nIn terms of the third factor, the court explained that ReDigi's business depended on transmitting works in their entirety, \"negating any claim of fair use.\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> (''But see'' ''[[Bill Graham Archives v. Dorling Kindersley]]'', holding that the reproduction of an entire Grateful Dead poster in a book was fair use despite the appropriation of the entire work).\n\n'''4. Effect Upon the Potential Market'''\n\nAs for the fourth fair use factor, the court held that ReDigi's sales were likely to undercut the market or value of Capitol's works, because the products sold on ReDigi's market were indistinguishable from \"legitimate primary market save for its lower price.\" <ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n===Liability Analysis===\nAfter determining that infringement had occurred, the court addressed [[legal liability|liability]] separately.\n\n====Direct Infringement====\nThe court held ReDigi directly liable for infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> Direct liability requires that a defendant must have \"engaged in some volitional conduct\" showing active violation of the plaintiff's copyright.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court reasoned that since ReDigi created a system where the only music files eligible for sale were copyrighted and purchased from iTunes, and that ReDigi programmed its software to do so, there was enough of a volitional act for ReDigi to be held for direct infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n====Contributory Infringement====\nIn contrast to direct infringement, \"[c]ontributory infringement occurs where 'one . . . with knowledge of the infringing activity, induces, causes or materially contributes to the infringing conduct of another.'\"<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> The court had \"little difficulty\" in holding that ReDigi knew or should have known its business would encourage infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> Moreover, because it found ReDigi contributorily liable, the court did not reach Capitol's inducement claim.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nThe court cited evidence from ReDigi's website, including advertisements that its service was legal, despite other published materials which warned otherwise.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/> ReDigi also claimed to have researched the law on this issue, arguing that such research helped it understand whether its service would result in infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\nReasoning that ReDigi provided the \"site and facilities\" for direct infringement, the court also held ReDigi materially contributed to its users' infringement.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n=====''Sony Betamax'' Defense=====\nThe court also held that ReDigi's service did not qualify for the [[Sony Corp. of America v. Universal City Studios, Inc.|Sony safe harbor]], because according to the ''Sony'' case, a service or product must be \"capable of substantial noninfringing uses,\" and ReDigi's service may only be used to infringe copyrighted works.<ref name=\"Motion for Partial Summary Judgment\"/>\n\n====Vicarious Infringement====\nVicarious liability for copyright infringement exists where the defendant \"has the right and ability to supervise the infringing activity and also has a direct financial interest in such activities.\"<ref name=\"9th Circuit Opinion\">''[http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/239/239.F3d.1004.00-16403.00-16401.html A&M Records, Inc. v.
