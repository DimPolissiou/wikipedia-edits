It is a partial [[beltway]] around [[New York City]], serving the northern half of New Jersey and the counties of [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] in New York. I-287, which is signed north\u2013south in New Jersey and east\u2013west in New York, follows a roughly horseshoe-shaped route from the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison Township, New Jersey]], clockwise to the [[New England Thruway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) in [[Rye, New York]], for {{convert|98.72|mi|km|2}}.  Through New Jersey, I-287 runs west from its southern terminus in Edison through suburban areas. In [[Bridgewater Township, New Jersey|Bridgewater Township]], the freeway takes a more northeasterly course, paralleled by [[U.S. Route 202 in New Jersey|U.S. Route&nbsp;202]] (US&nbsp;202). The northernmost part of I-287 in New Jersey passes through mountainous surroundings. After crossing into New York at [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], I-287 turns east on the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]) and runs through Rockland County. After crossing the [[Hudson River]] on the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], I-287 splits from I-87 near [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] and continues east through Westchester County on the '''Cross-Westchester Expressway''' until it reaches the New England Thruway. Within New Jersey, I-287 is maintained by the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT), and within New York, it is maintained by the [[New York State Thruway Authority]] (NYSTA).\n\nA bypass around New York City had been planned since the 1950s and would become a part of the Interstate Highway System and receive the I-287 designation. The Cross-Westchester Expressway, which was originally designated as '''Interstate&nbsp;187''', opened in 1960 as '''Interstate&nbsp;487''' before later becoming part of I-287. The New York State Thruway portion of I-287, which included a crossing of the Hudson River, opened in 1955. In New Jersey, the proposed I-287 had originally been designated as FAI Corridor 104 and incorporated what was planned as the '''Middlesex Freeway'''. The New Jersey section of I-287 between the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison and US&nbsp;202 in [[Montville, New Jersey|Montville]] opened in stages between the 1960s and 1973; the remainder was completed by 1994. The aging [[Tappan Zee Bridge (1955\u20132017)|Tappan Zee Bridge]] was replaced with a [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|new span]] which opened in stages between 2017 and 2018.\n\nA [[Long Island Sound link|proposed tunnel]] across the [[Long Island Sound]] between Rye and [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]] on [[Long Island]] would link the eastern terminus of I-287 to [[New York State Route&nbsp;25]] (NY&nbsp;25) and [[New York State Route 135|NY&nbsp;135]] in [[Syosset, New York|Syosset]].\n\n==Route description==\n{{lengths table|length_ref=<ref name=fhwa />}}\n|-\n|[[New Jersey|NJ]] || 67.54 || 108.70\n|-\n|[[New York (state)|NY]] || 31.18 || 50.18\n|-\n|'''Total''' || 98.72 || 158.87\n|}\n\n===New Jersey===\n\n====Middlesex County====\n[[File:2018-05-20 15 20 25 View south along Interstate 287 (Middlesex Freeway) at Exit 3 (Middlesex County Route 501, New Durham Road, New Durham, Metuchen) in Edison Township, Middlesex County, New Jersey.jpg|thumb|right|View south along I-287 at Exit 3 (CR 501) in Edison]]\nI-287 begins at an interchange with the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison]] in  [[Middlesex County, New Jersey]], where the freeway continues east as [[New Jersey Route 440|Route&nbsp;440]] towards [[Perth Amboy, New Jersey|Perth Amboy]] and [[Staten Island]].<ref name=sld>{{cite web|url= http://www.state.nj.us/transportation/refdata/sldiag/pdf/00000287__-.pdf|title=I-287 Straight Line Diagram|accessdate=March 17, 2020|format=PDF|publisher=[[New Jersey Department of Transportation]]}}</ref><ref name=gm>{{Google maps |url=https://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&source=s_d&saddr=40.5285,+-74.336&daddr=I-287+N+to:41.023427,-74.245605+to:interstate+287+and+interstate+95+port+chester,+ny&geocode=FXRqagIdALmR-w%3BFSCwbgIdlveP-w%3B%3BFXtwcQIdCvSb-ylpOJeJTZfCiTG1zrvna6XvQA&hl=en&mra=dpe&mrcr=0&mrsp=2&sz=9&via=1,2&sll=40.75558,-74.012146&sspn=0.867569,2.694397&ie=UTF8&t=h&z=9|title=overview of Interstate 287|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}</ref> Within Middlesex County, I-287 is called the Lt.

It is a partial [[beltway]] around [[New York City]], serving the northern half of New Jersey and the counties of [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] in New York. I-287, which is signed north\u2013south in New Jersey and east\u2013west in New York, follows a roughly horseshoe-shaped route from the [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) in [[Edison, New Jersey|Edison Township, New Jersey]], clockwise to the [[New England Thruway]] ([[Interstate 95 in New York|I-95]]) in [[Rye, New York]], for {{convert|98.72|mi|km|2}}.  Through New Jersey, I-287 runs west from its southern terminus in Edison through suburban areas. In [[Bridgewater Township, New Jersey|Bridgewater Township]], the freeway takes a more northeasterly course, paralleled by [[U.S. Route 202 in New Jersey|U.S. Route&nbsp;202]] (US&nbsp;202). The northernmost part of I-287 in New Jersey passes through mountainous surroundings. After crossing into New York at [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], I-287 turns east on the [[New York State Thruway]] ([[Interstate 87 (New York)|I-87]]) and runs though Rockland County. After crossing the [[Hudson River]] on the [[Tappan Zee Bridge (2017\u2013present)|Tappan Zee Bridge]], I-287 splits from I-87 near [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]] and continues east through Westchester County on the '''Cross-Westchester Expressway''' until it reaches the New England Thruway. Within New Jersey, I-287 is maintained by the [[New Jersey Department of Transportation]] (NJDOT), and within New York, it is maintained by the [[New York State Thruway Authority]] (NYSTA).\n\nA bypass around New York City had been planned since the 1950s and would become a part of the Interstate Highway System and receive the I-287 designation. The Cross-Westchester Expressway, which was originally designated as '''Interstate&nbsp;187''', opened in 1960 as '''Interstate&nbsp;487''' before later becoming part of I-287. The New York State Thruway portion of I-287, which included a crossing of the Hudson River, opened in 1955. In New Jersey, the proposed I-287 had originally been designated as FAI Corridor 104 and incorporated what was planned as the '''Middlesex Freeway'''. The New Jersey section of I-287 between the New Jersey Turnpike in Edison and US&nbsp;202 in [[Montville, New Jersey|Montville]] opened in stages between the 1960s and 1973; the remainder was completed by 1994.
