Generally, neckties are excluded from business casual dress, unless worn in nontraditional ways. The acceptability of blue [[jeans]] and denim cloth clothing varies \u2014 some businesses consider them to be sloppy and informal.\n\n==Education system ==\n{{Overly detailed|section|date=September 2019}}\nMany schools around the world implement dress codes in the school system to prevent students from wearing inappropriate clothing items to school and was thought to help influence a safer and more professional environment. \n\n=== United States education ===\nIn 1996, former U. S. President [[Bill Clinton]] announced his support for the idea of [[school uniform]]s by stating, \u201cSchool uniforms are one step that may help break the cycle of violence, truancy and disorder by helping young students understand what really counts is what kind of people they are.\u201d Many [[school district]]s in the United States took up the idea.<ref>{{cite web|last=Bowen|first=Sherry|title=Should Kids Wear School Uniforms?|url=http://www.eduguide.org/article/should-kids-wear-school-uniforms|publisher=EduGuide|accessdate=September 22, 2013}}</ref>\n\nEven though dress code was created to positively affect schools, a common held belief in the U.S. is that the rules actually impede on students' right to self-expression. There have been many court cases regarding school dress code, the first being the [[Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District]]. The case was held because students wore black [[armband]]s to protest the Vietnam war.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://education.findlaw.com/student-rights/school-dress-codes.html|title=School Dress Codes - FindLaw|work=Findlaw|access-date=2017-12-08}}</ref>\n\n====Dress code violations====\nNon-communicative dress code violations in public schools are violations that are without implications of hate, gang-affiliation, etc.<ref name=\"Herbon, Beth 2000\">Herbon, Beth, and Jane E.

The punishment prompted Wiggins to write an open letter to the school's assistant vice principal at Harrison Trimble High School in Moncton, New Brunswick. In the letter, Wiggins concentrated specifically on the fact that females are often blamed for the behaviour of males, saying that if a boy \"will get distracted by my upper back and shoulders then he needs to be sent home and practice self-control.\" She was then given a one-day suspension after writing and submitting the letter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/14/lauren-wiggins-haltar-top_n_7284528.html|title=High Schooler Lauren Wiggins' Letter Nails Exactly What's Wrong With School Dress Codes.

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage.

When they arrived they were told that they are not allowed to go to the seating area because Amber was too young at the time. A man at a merchandise table generously gave Amber and her mother \"All Access\" passes as long as they wouldn't go backstage. They ended up seeing the concert from the VIP area and stood next to Boris Becker. Amber remembers crying after the concert was over.\n\n===2016-present:Musical career===\nMark released her debut single \"S P A C E\" to her Soundcloud in 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/6wq9aq/who-the-hell-is-amber-mark|title=Who the Hell Is Amber Mark?|last=Taylor Bennett|first=Kim|date=April 25, 2016|work=Vice|accessdate=December 4, 2019}}</ref> In 2017 she released her first album \"3:33am\". Mark explains that it was named that because \"Three has been a really common number in my life. My mother was born in 1953, my brother was born in 1983 and I was born in 1993. Then my mum passed away on June 3, at 10:23pm in 2013. Since then, I'd see threes everywhere.

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

For \"Operation Successor\" to succeed, however, it was necessary to have a massive provocation. In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Position of the US government ==\nIn the wake of the apartment bombings president [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], secretary of defense [[William Cohen|Cohen]] and secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright|Albright]] have condemned the bombings as acts of terrorism.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Statement on the Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CHRG-106shrg61866/html/CHRG-106shrg61866.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 17, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Clinton|first1=William|title=Radio Remarks on Terrorist Attacks in Russia |url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PPP-1999-book2/html/PPP-1999-book2-doc-pg1555.htm |publisher=[[U.S. Government Publishing Office]] |date=September 18, 1999}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Hoffman |first1=David |authorlink1=David E.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

Together with a friend, he entered the storehouse to see the weapons. The friends were surprised to see that the storehouse contained sacks with the word \u201csugar\u201d on them. Pinyaev and his friend were discouraged, but didn't want to leave the storehouse empty-handed. The two paratroopers cut a hole in one of the bags and put some sugar in a plastic bag. They made tea with the sugar, but the taste of the tea was terrible. They became frightened because the substance might turn out to be saltpeter, and brought the plastic bag to a platoon commander.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.

A widespread species with a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], it is a medium-sized puffball with a round [[ascocarp (fungus)|fruit body]] tapering to a wide stalk, and dimensions of {{convert|1.5|to|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|3|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall. It is off-white with a top covered in short spiny bumps or \"jewels\", which are easily rubbed off to leave a netlike pattern on the surface. When mature it becomes brown, and a hole in the top opens to release [[spores]] in a burst when the body is compressed by touch or falling raindrops.\n\n[[File:Common puffball, releasing spores in a burst by compressing the body.webm|thumb|Common puffball, releasing spores in a burst by compressing the body]]\n\nThe puffball grows in fields, gardens, and along roadsides, as well as in grassy clearings in woods.

A widespread species with a [[cosmopolitan distribution]], it is a medium-sized puffball with a round [[ascocarp (fungus)|fruit body]] tapering to a wide stalk, and dimensions of {{convert|1.5|to|6|cm|in|1|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|3|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall. It is off-white with a top covered in short spiny bumps or \"jewels\", which are easily rubbed off to leave a netlike pattern on the surface. When mature it becomes brown, and a hole in the top opens to release [[spores]] in a burst when the body is compressed by touch or falling raindrops.\n\n[[File:Common puffball, releasing spores in a burst by compressing the body.webm|thumb|Common puffball, releasing spores in a burst by compressing the body]]\n\nThe puffball grows in fields, gardens, and along roadsides, as well as in grassy clearings in woods. It is [[edible mushroom|edible]] when young and the [[gleba|internal flesh]] is completely white, although care must be taken to avoid confusion with immature fruit bodies of [[poisonous mushroom|poisonous]] ''[[Amanita]]'' species. ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'' can usually be distinguished from other similar puffballs by differences in surface texture. Several chemical compounds have been isolated and identified from the fruit bodies of ''L.&nbsp;perlatum'', including [[sterol]] derivatives, [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] compounds that give the puffball its flavor and odor, and the unusual [[amino acid]] lycoperdic acid. [[Extract]]s of the puffball have [[antimicrobial]] and [[Antifungal medication|antifungal]] activities.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe species was first [[species description|described]] in the scientific literature in 1796 by mycologist [[Christiaan Hendrik Persoon]].<ref name=\"Persoon 1796\"/> [[Synonym (biology)|Synonyms]] include ''Lycoperdon gemmatum'' (as described by [[August Batsch]] in 1783<ref name=\"Batsch 1786\"/>); the [[variety (botany)|variety]] ''Lycoperdon gemmatum'' var.

It has a stem-like base. The outer surface of the fruit body (the [[peridium|exoperidium]]) is covered in short cone-shaped spines that are interspersed with granular warts. The spines, which are whitish, gray, or brown, can be easily rubbed off, and leave [[wikt:reticulate|reticulate]] pock marks or scars after they are removed.<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/> The base of the puffball is thick, and has internal chambers. It is initially white, but turns yellow, olive, or brownish in age.<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/> The reticulate pattern resulting from the rubbed-off spines is less evident on the base.<ref name=\"Pegler 1995\"/>\n\nIn maturity, the exoperidium at the top of the puffball sloughs away, revealing a pre-formed hole ([[ostiole]]) in the endoperidium, through which the spores can escape.<ref name=\"Miller 1988\"/> In young puffballs, the internal contents, the [[gleba]], is white and firm, but turns brown and powdery as the [[spore]]s mature.<ref name=\"Arora 1986\"/>  The gleba contains minute chambers that are lined with [[hymenium]] (the fertile, spore-bearing tissue); the chambers collapse when the spores mature.<ref name=\"Miller 1988\"/> Mature puffballs release their powdery spores through the ostiole when they are compressed by touch or falling raindrops. A study of the spore release mechanism in ''L.&nbsp;pyriforme'' using high-speed [[schlieren photography]] determined that raindrops of 1&nbsp;mm diameter or greater, including rain drips from nearby trees, were sufficient to cause spore discharge. The puffed spores are ejected from the ostiole at a velocity of about 100&nbsp;cm/second to form a centimeter-tall cloud one-hundredth of a second after impact.

{"title_page": "Carpatho-Rusyn Society", "text_new": "[[File:Large Rusyn emblem.jpg|thumb|Symbol of C-RS with motto 'manifesting Rusyn culture and history']]\nThe '''Carpatho-Rusyn Society''' ('''C-RS''') is a non-profit cultural organization located in the United States dedicated to promoting [[Rusyns|Carpatho-Rusyn]] culture and history. The world\u2019s largest exclusively cultural Carpatho-Rusyn organization, C-RS was established in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1994 and has over 1,250 members worldwide. \n\nThe Carpatho-Rusyns are a distinct [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicity who have lived since the Middle Ages in remote villages scattered along the foothills and valleys of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] of East Central Europe (located in present-day [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Romania]] as well as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]]). The name [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] identifies them as descendants, in part, of a people from the vast lands of ancient [[Rus']] who were converted to the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian Church]] in the 9th century. \n\nC-RS works to educate those of Rusyn descent as well as others about Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. \u00a0The society supports the preservation and development of Rusyn culture on both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n==Establishment==\n\nThe impetus for development of C-RS emanated from the Second World Congress of Rusyns held in [[Krynica-Zdr\u00f3j|Krynica]], Poland in 1993. The new society built upon the inclusive approaches of other American Carpatho-Rusyn organizations, particularly the Carpatho-Rusyn Research Center founded in 1978 by [[Paul Robert Magocsi]] and the Rusin Association founded by Larry Goga in 1983.\n\nFormed by largely third and fourth-generation Carpatho-Rusyn Americans, C-RS was dedicated to helping others discover their Carpatho-Rusyn heritage at a time when the designation \u2018Carpatho-Rusyn\u2019 was not widely known. Honoring a resilient, stateless people whose homeland changed hands repeatedly over the past centuries, C-RS sought to tell the remarkable story of \u2018a people from nowhere\u2019 \u2013 a proverbial phrase coined by the famous American artist of Carpatho-Rusyn ancestry, [[Andy Warhol]].\n\nThe society\u2019s logo prominently features the Carpatho-Rusyn national emblem as its symbol, a red bear facing blue and gold stripes with the motto \u201cmanifesting Rusyn culture and history\u201d. This shield was first adopted as the official emblem of the Czechoslovak province of [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Subcarpathian Rus\u2019]] on March 30, 1920. It fell into disuse after [[Nazi Germany]]\u2019s dismembering of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 but was adopted later as the official symbol of the [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Transcarpathian oblast]] of Ukraine on December 18, 1990. The emblem\u2019s left field is divided into 7 horizontal blue and gold alternating stripes representing the seven largest rivers of the land: the [[Tisza|Tysa]], [[Teresva (river)|Teresva]], [[Tereblia (river)|Tereblya]], [[Rika (river)|Rika]], [[Borzhava]], [[Latorica]] and [[Uzh River|Uzh]]. The silver background represents the rich salt mines of the area and the red bear is depicted as the king of the snowy Carpathian Mountains. \n\n==Early Years==\n\nThe society expanded rapidly from its eight original founders. This growth necessitated a newsletter for its members, [[New Rusyn Times|''The New Rusyn Times'']]''.'' In addition to promoting self-awareness of Carpatho-Rusyn identity, the mission of C-RS \u2018holds in high esteem the continuity of life which connects the living Rusyn culture to its treasured and ancient heritage\u2019. Through its growing membership, the society promoted opportunities to learn, express, and enjoy the beauty and life affirming values of a living Carpatho-Rusyn heritage.\n[[File:Carpatho-Rusyn Folk exhibit.jpg|thumb|Carpatho-Rusyn Folk Exhibit]]\nC-RS has hosted conferences on Carpatho-Rusyn history and genealogy and has managed the Carpatho-Rusyn cultural display at the [[Pittsburgh Folk Festival]]. The society co-sponsored a national Carpatho-Rusyn cultural celebration at the [[The Andy Warhol Museum|Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh and provides traveling displays of Rusyn culture for church and ethnic festivals.\n\nOne of C-RS\u2019s greatest early successes was in reestablishing relations with the European Carpatho-Rusyn community and supporting their efforts to resurrect and develop Carpatho-Rusyn culture after fifty years of [[Communism|Communist]] persecution. The society has two European funds \u2013 Humanitarian Aid and the Rusyn Homeland Fund.\n[[File:CRS Exhibition of Rusyn Art.jpg|thumb|C-RS exhibition of Carpatho-Rusyn Art]]\nThe Humanitarian Aid Fund was created in 1996 when Carpatho-Rusyn villages in the Transcarpathian oblast of Ukraine experienced an unexpected late fall flood killing 17 and leaving hundreds homeless. Through its members, C-RS worked with the [[American Red Cross]] to set up relief for the people of Subcarpathian Rus\u2019. \u00a0Since then the fund sends primarily medical supplies to healthcare professionals in Transcarpathia for those in need.\n\nThe society\u2019s Rusyn Homeland Fund provided comprehensive support to the Carpatho-Rusyn community in eastern Slovakia at a critical time before the 2001 census to heighten ethnic awareness of those of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. The fund underwrote the printing of maps showing Carpatho-Rusyn villages, a traveling display of Carpatho-Rusyn culture, and the widespread mailing of Rusyn-language newspapers and magazines to Carpatho-Rusyn households. Consequently, the number of Slovak citizens identifying as Carpatho-Rusyn increased dramatically compared with the previous census of 1991. The fund also provided financial support to help create a network of Rusyn language schools in [[Transcarpathia]], Ukraine.\n\n==Moving Forward==\n\nThe founding president of C-RS was John Righetti who served until 2012 and is now president emeritus. He was succeeded by Jim Kepchar-Kaminski (2013-2015) and Maryann Sivak (2015-present). The organization currently consists of 6 chapters and 8 branches located throughout the United States. \n\nC-RS seeks to collaborate with all Carpatho-Rusyn organizations worldwide to disseminate historical, genealogical, linguistic and ethno-cultural information. In addition to its newsletter, the society created a website, blog and e-mail bulletin, C-RS Connection. Since 2004, the Carpatho-Rusyn Society Heritage Program has broadcast Carpatho-Rusyn music and information on [[WPIT]] in the greater Pittsburgh area and worldwide via the web. The society currently hosts a genealogy forum on its website and is expanding its social media presence\n\nPrograms that have served both the Carpatho-Rusyn American and European communities include the highly successful Rusyn Heritage Tour. The society has promoted an annual two- week tour of the Carpatho-Rusyn communities in Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine. The tour experience is one of immersion in contemporary Rusyn culture as well as allowing for visits to ancestral villages and genealogical research. Since 2011, C-RS has supported and offered scholarships to the Studium Carpato-Ruthenorum, an annual international summer school for Rusyn language and culture held at [[University of Pre\u0161ov|Presov University]].\n\n'''''National Cultural Center'''''[[File:Cultural center jpg.jpg|thumb|Carpatho-Rusyn Cultural and Educational Center, Munhall, PA]]\nIn 2004, C-RS purchased the former [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral (Pittsburgh)#The%20first%20cathedral%2C%201903|St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral]] at 915 Dickson Street in [[Munhall, Pennsylvania]] and converted it into the Carpatho-Rusyn Cultural and Educational Center. The century-old building holds significance for those of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. It was designed in 1903 by Hungarian-born architect [[Titus de Bobula]] and was patterned after the Carpatho-Rusyn [[Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in [[Uzhhorod]] (the Ungv\u00e1r, [[Kingdom of Hungary]]). In 1929, the building was chosen as the cathedral for the Ruthenian (Rusyn) Greek Catholic Exarchate in America.\n[[File:Slavjane Folk Ensemble performing at C-RS 25th Anniversary.jpg|thumb|Slavjane Folk Ensemble performance at C-RS 25th Anniversary celebration]]\nIn May 2019, the society celebrated its 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary at its renovated cultural center.

The world\u2019s largest exclusively cultural Carpatho-Rusyn organization, C-RS was established in [[Pittsburgh]] in 1994 and has over 1,250 members worldwide. \n\nThe Carpatho-Rusyns are a distinct [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethnicity who have lived since the Middle Ages in remote villages scattered along the foothills and valleys of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] of East Central Europe (located in present-day [[Poland]], [[Slovakia]], [[Hungary]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Romania]] as well as [[Croatia]] and [[Serbia]]). The name [[Rusyns|Rusyn]] identifies them as descendants, in part, of a people from the vast lands of ancient [[Rus']] who were converted to the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christian Church]] in the 9th century. \n\nC-RS works to educate those of Rusyn descent as well as others about Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. \u00a0The society supports the preservation and development of Rusyn culture on both sides of the Atlantic. \n\n==Establishment==\n\nThe impetus for development of C-RS emanated from the Second World Congress of Rusyns held in [[Krynica-Zdr\u00f3j|Krynica]], Poland in 1993. The new society built upon the inclusive approaches of other American Carpatho-Rusyn organizations, particularly the Carpatho-Rusyn Research Center founded in 1978 by [[Paul Robert Magocsi]] and the Rusin Association founded by Larry Goga in 1983.\n\nFormed by largely third and fourth-generation Carpatho-Rusyn Americans, C-RS was dedicated to helping others discover their Carpatho-Rusyn heritage at a time when the designation \u2018Carpatho-Rusyn\u2019 was not widely known. Honoring a resilient, stateless people whose homeland changed hands repeatedly over the past centuries, C-RS sought to tell the remarkable story of \u2018a people from nowhere\u2019 \u2013 a proverbial phrase coined by the famous American artist of Carpatho-Rusyn ancestry, [[Andy Warhol]].\n\nThe society\u2019s logo prominently features the Carpatho-Rusyn national emblem as its symbol, a red bear facing blue and gold stripes with the motto \u201cmanifesting Rusyn culture and history\u201d. This shield was first adopted as the official emblem of the Czechoslovak province of [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Subcarpathian Rus\u2019]] on March 30, 1920. It fell into disuse after [[Nazi Germany]]\u2019s dismembering of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 but was adopted later as the official symbol of the [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Transcarpathian oblast]] of Ukraine on December 18, 1990. The emblem\u2019s left field is divided into 7 horizontal blue and gold alternating stripes representing the seven largest rivers of the land: the [[Tisza|Tysa]], [[Teresva (river)|Teresva]], [[Tereblia (river)|Tereblya]], [[Rika (river)|Rika]], [[Borzhava]], [[Latorica]] and [[Uzh River|Uzh]]. The silver background represents the rich salt mines of the area and the red bear is depicted as the king of the snowy Carpathian Mountains. \n\n==Early Years==\n\nThe society expanded rapidly from its eight original founders. This growth necessitated a newsletter for its members, [[New Rusyn Times|''The New Rusyn Times'']]''.'' In addition to promoting self-awareness of Carpatho-Rusyn identity, the mission of C-RS \u2018holds in high esteem the continuity of life which connects the living Rusyn culture to its treasured and ancient heritage\u2019. Through its growing membership, the society promoted opportunities to learn, express, and enjoy the beauty and life affirming values of a living Carpatho-Rusyn heritage.\n[[File:Carpatho-Rusyn Folk exhibit.jpg|thumb|Carpatho-Rusyn Folk Exhibit]]\nC-RS has hosted conferences on Carpatho-Rusyn history and genealogy and has managed the Carpatho-Rusyn cultural display at the [[Pittsburgh Folk Festival]]. The society co-sponsored a national Carpatho-Rusyn cultural celebration at the [[The Andy Warhol Museum|Andy Warhol Museum]] in Pittsburgh and provides traveling displays of Rusyn culture for church and ethnic festivals.\n\nOne of C-RS\u2019s greatest early successes was in reestablishing relations with the European Carpatho-Rusyn community and supporting their efforts to resurrect and develop Carpatho-Rusyn culture after fifty years of [[Communism|Communist]] persecution. The society has two European funds \u2013 Humanitarian Aid and the Rusyn Homeland Fund.\n[[File:CRS Exhibition of Rusyn Art.jpg|thumb|C-RS exhibition of Carpatho-Rusyn Art]]\nThe Humanitarian Aid Fund was created in 1996 when Carpatho-Rusyn villages in the Transcarpathian oblast of Ukraine experienced an unexpected late fall flood killing 17 and leaving hundreds homeless. Through its members, C-RS worked with the [[American Red Cross]] to set up relief for the people of Subcarpathian Rus\u2019. \u00a0Since then the fund sends primarily medical supplies to healthcare professionals in Transcarpathia for those in need.\n\nThe society\u2019s Rusyn Homeland Fund provided comprehensive support to the Carpatho-Rusyn community in eastern Slovakia at a critical time before the 2001 census to heighten ethnic awareness of those of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. The fund underwrote the printing of maps showing Carpatho-Rusyn villages, a traveling display of Carpatho-Rusyn culture, and the widespread mailing of Rusyn-language newspapers and magazines to Carpatho-Rusyn households. Consequently, the number of Slovak citizens identifying as Carpatho-Rusyn increased dramatically compared with the previous census of 1991. The fund also provided financial support to help create a network of Rusyn language schools in [[Transcarpathia]], Ukraine.\n\n==Moving Forward==\n\nThe founding president of C-RS was John Righetti who served until 2012 and is now president emeritus. He was succeeded by Jim Kepchar-Kaminski (2013-2015) and Maryann Sivak (2015-present). The organization currently consists of 6 chapters and 8 branches located throughout the United States. \n\nC-RS seeks to collaborate with all Carpatho-Rusyn organizations worldwide to disseminate historical, genealogical, linguistic and ethno-cultural information. In addition to its newsletter, the society created a website, blog and e-mail bulletin, C-RS Connection. Since 2004, the Carpatho-Rusyn Society Heritage Program has broadcast Carpatho-Rusyn music and information on [[WPIT]] in the greater Pittsburgh area and worldwide via the web. The society currently hosts a genealogy forum on its website and is expanding its social media presence\n\nPrograms that have served both the Carpatho-Rusyn American and European communities include the highly successful Rusyn Heritage Tour. The society has promoted an annual two- week tour of the Carpatho-Rusyn communities in Poland, Slovakia and Ukraine. The tour experience is one of immersion in contemporary Rusyn culture as well as allowing for visits to ancestral villages and genealogical research. Since 2011, C-RS has supported and offered scholarships to the Studium Carpato-Ruthenorum, an annual international summer school for Rusyn language and culture held at [[University of Pre\u0161ov|Presov University]].\n\n'''''IV. National Cultural Center'''''\n[[File:Cultural center jpg.jpg|thumb|Carpatho-Rusyn Cultural and Educational Center, Munhall, PA]]\nIn 2004, C-RS purchased the former [[St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral (Pittsburgh)#The%20first%20cathedral%2C%201903|St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral]] at 915 Dickson Street in [[Munhall, Pennsylvania]] and converted it into the Carpatho-Rusyn Cultural and Educational Center. The century-old building holds significance for those of Carpatho-Rusyn heritage. It was designed in 1903 by Hungarian-born architect [[Titus de Bobula]] and was patterned after the Carpatho-Rusyn [[Greek Catholic Church|Greek Catholic]] Cathedral of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross in [[Uzhhorod]] (the Ungv\u00e1r, [[Kingdom of Hungary]]). In 1929, the building was chosen as the cathedral for the Ruthenian (Rusyn) Greek Catholic Exarchate in America.\n[[File:Slavjane Folk Ensemble performing at C-RS 25th Anniversary.jpg|thumb|Slavjane Folk Ensemble performance at C-RS 25th Anniversary celebration]]\nIn May 2019, the society celebrated its 25<sup>th</sup> Anniversary at its renovated cultural center. Professor [[Paul Robert Magocsi]], the world\u2019s foremost authority on Carpatho-Rusyns, gave the keynote address and received the society\u2019s highest honor, the [[Michael Strank]] Award, named after the Carpatho-Rusyn-American Marine sergeant who helped raise the US flag at the [[Battle of Iwo Jima]].
