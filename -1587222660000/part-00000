She represents the [[Rajas]] Guna, and the [[Iccha-shakti]].\n\nThe image, icons, and sculptures of Lakshmi are represented with symbolism. Her name is derived from Sanskrit root words for knowing the goal and understanding the objective.<ref name=carol/> Her four arms are symbolic of the four goals of humanity that are considered good in Hinduism \u2013 dharma (pursuit of ethical, moral life), artha (pursuit of wealth, means of life), kama (pursuit of love, emotional fulfillment) and moksha (pursuit of self-knowledge, liberation).<ref name=ttgov/><ref name=apara>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 57\u201359</ref>\n\nIn Lakshmi's iconography, she is either sitting or standing on a lotus and typically carrying a lotus in one or two hands. The lotus carries symbolic meanings in Hinduism and other Indian traditions. It symbolises knowledge, self-realisation, and liberation in Vedic context, and represents reality, consciousness and karma (work, deed) in the Tantra ([[Sahasrara]]) context.<ref name=parasarthy>A Parasarthy (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, pages 91\u201392, 160\u2013162</ref> The lotus, a flower that blossoms in clean or dirty water, also symbolises purity regardless of the good or bad circumstances in which it grows.

As a bird reputedly blinded by daylight, the owl also serves as a symbolic reminder to refrain from blindness and greed after knowledge and wealth has been acquired.<ref>Ajnatanama (1983), ''Symbolism in Hinduism'', Chinmaya Mission Publication, {{ISBN|978-8175971493}}, page 317-318</ref>\n[[File:Gaja Lakshmi.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Manuscript painting of Gaja-Lakshmi, ca 1780 AD.]]\n\nIn some representations, wealth either symbolically pours out from one of her hands or she simply holds a jar of money. This symbolism has a dual meaning: wealth manifested through Lakshmi means both materials as well as spiritual wealth.<ref name=parasarthy/> Her face and open hands are in a mudra that signifies compassion, giving or ''daana''(charity).<ref name=apara/>\n\nLakshmi typically wears a red dress embroidered with golden threads, symbolizes fortune and wealth. She, goddess of wealth and prosperity, is often represented with her husband Vishnu, the god who maintains human life filled with justice and peace. This symbolism implies wealth and prosperity is coupled with maintenance of life, justice, and peace.<ref name=parasarthy/>\n\nIn Japan, where Lakshmi is known as ''[[Kissh\u014dten]]'', she is commonly depicted with the [[Cintamani#Nomenclature.2C orthography and etymology|Nyoih\u014dju gem (\u5982\u610f\u5b9d\u73e0)]] in her hand.\n\n==Names==\n[[File:Lakshmi (Banteay Srei, Angkor) (6843511981).jpg|thumb|Gaja Lakshmi, Cambodia, ca. 944-968]]\n\nLakshmi has numerous names and numerous ancient [[Stotram]] and [[Sutra]]s of Hinduism recite her various names:<ref name=rhodes>Constantina Rhodes (2011), Invoking Lakshmi: The Goddess of Wealth in Song and Ceremony, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-1438433202}}</ref><ref name=vkumara>Vijaya Kumara, 108 Names of Lakshmi, Sterling Publishers, {{ISBN|9788120720282}}</ref>\n\n*''Padm\u0101'': She of the [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] (she who is mounted upon or dwelling in a lotus)\n*''Kamal\u0101'': She of the lotus\n*''Padmapriy\u0101'': Lotus-lover\n*''Padmam\u0101l\u0101dh\u0101ra Dev\u012b'': Goddess bearing a garland of lotuses\n*''Padmamukh\u012b'': Lotus-faced (she whose face is as like as a lotus)\n*''Padm\u0101k\u1e63\u012b'': Lotus-eyed (she whose eyes are as beautiful as a lotus)\n*''Padmahasta'': Lotus-hand (she whose hand is holding (a) lotus(es))\n*''Padmasundar\u012b'': She who is as beautiful as a lotus\n*''Sri'': Radiance, eminence, splendor, wealth \n*''\u015ar\u012bj\u0101'': Jatika of Sri\n*''Vi\u1e63\u1e47upriy\u0101'': Lover of Vishnu (she who is the beloved of Vishnu)\n*''Ul\u016bkav\u0101hin\u012b'': Owl-mounted (she who is riding an owl)\n*''Nandika '': The one who gives pleasure , vessel made up of clay and Vishnupriya (she who is the beloved of Vishnu)\nHer other names include:<ref name=rhodes/> Manushri, Chakrika, Kamalika, Aishwarya, Lalima, Indira, Kalyani, Nandika, Nandini, [[Vaishnavi (Matrika goddess)|Vaishnavi]], Samruddhi, Bhargavi, Sridevi, Bhudevi, Nila Devi, [[Chanchala]], Jalaja, Madhavi, Sujata, Shreeya, Prachi, Haripriya, Madhu, Parama, Janamodini, Ketki, Malti, Vidya, Vasuda, Vedavati, Tilottama, Devi, Kriyalakshmi, Viroopa, Apara, Aruna, Akhila, Bala, Kuhu, Purnima, Anumati, Anagha, Avashya, Sita, Radha,  Satyabhama, Rukmini, Jambhavati, Tulasi, Ramaa, Taruni, Jyotsna, Jyoti, Nimeshika, Atibha, Swarna Kamala, Smriti.<ref name=vkumara/>\n\n==Ancient literature on Lakshmi==\n\n===Upanishads===\nShakta [[Upanishad]]s are dedicated to the Trinity ([[Tridevi]]) of goddesses \u2013 Lakshmi, [[Saraswati]] and [[Parvati]].

[[Amrita]], the divine nectar that grants immortality, could only be obtained by churning Kshirasagar ([[Ocean of Milk]]). The devas and asuras both sought immortality and decided to churn the Kshirasagar with Mount Mandhara. The [[samudra manthan]] commenced with the devas on one side and the asuras on the other. [[Vishnu]] incarnated as Kurma, the tortoise and a mountain was placed on the tortoise as a churning pole. [[Vasuki (snake)|Vasuki]], the great venom-spewing serpent-god, was wrapped around the mountain and used to churn the ocean. A host of divine celestial objects came up during the churning. Along with them emerged the goddess Lakshmi. In some versions, she is said to be daughter of the sea god since she emerged from the sea.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}\n\nIn [[Garuda Purana]], [[Linga Purana]] and [[Padma Purana]], Lakshmi is said to have been born as daughter of the divine sage [[Bhrigu]] and his wife Khyati and was named ''Bhargavi''. According to Vishnu Purana, the universe was created when the ''Devas''(god) and ''Asuras''(evil) churn the cosmic ocean of milk([[Ksheera Sagara]]). Lakshmi came out of the ocean bearing lotus, along with divine cow [[Kamadhenu]], [[Varuni]], [[Parijat]] tree, [[Apsaras]], [[Chandra]](the moon) and [[Dhanvantari]] with [[Amrita]](nectar of immortality). When she appeared, she had a choice to go to Devas or Asuras. She chose Devas' side and among thirty deities, she chose to be with Vishnu. Thereafter, in all three worlds, the lotus-bearing goddess was celebrated.<ref name=buitenen>J. A.

However, as more students came he began to teach more advanced levels. He explained that in order to develop full flexibility, the student must restore his own primal nature, through several Taoist yoga practices, as follows: yin ''asanas''\u2014mostly sitting or lying postures; yang ''asanas''\u2014more active, strenuous postures; Taoist Flow yoga\u2014both yin and yang yoga postures practiced in continuous, smooth and circular motions; ''[[Chi Kung]]''\u2014involving simple and gentle movement and breathing techniques; and Taoist alchemy\u2014based, supposedly, upon the Taoist theory of the five elements used in [[Chinese medicine]]. Taoist alchemy purports to embody the energetic attributes of various animals and to enliven the five alchemical elements believed to be contained in the body's energetic field, namely Earth, Metal, Water, Wood, and Fire.

{"title_page": "History of institutions for deaf education", "text_new": "The establishment of '''schools and institutions specializing in deaf education''' has a history spanning back across multiple centuries. They utilized a variety of instructional approaches and philosophies. The manner in which the language barrier is handled between the hearing and the deaf remains a topic of great controversy.

Students were also educated in various vocational trades popular during the era. The school's primary focus was on the acquisition of language. The approach made popular by \u00c9p\u00e9e was dubbed ''signes m\u00e9thodiques'' or [[Manually coded language|Methodical Sign]]. This consisted of translating French Sign Language and converting it to \u00c9p\u00e9e's French Manual alphabet. This was composed of individual hand shapes and signs used to represent specific counterparts of the written and spoken French language in a direct word for word translation. This form of methodical sign is also referred to as [[Manualism|manual sign]], or in this case [[Signed French]]. This differs explicitly from [[French Sign Language]], which is a separate language in its own right. Such methods of manual language translation remain popular today, especially in hearing-based educational approaches to deaf education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onlineexhibits.library.yale.edu/s/deaf-culture/page/manual-systems|title=Manually Coded Language and Alternate Sign Systems \u00b7 Yale University Library Online Exhibitions|website=onlineexhibits.library.yale.edu|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n \n=== Influences and Survival of Institution ===\n\nOn July 29, 1791 the school was renamed the [[Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris]], which it remains and is active to this day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.injs-paris.fr/page/educatif|title=Educatif|date=2013-02-28|website=INJS Paris|language=fr|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> However, today the institution uses French Sign Language in its educational practices, as opposed to Manual French.

Braidwood's input into the development and application of a signed language has been credited as a one of the most significant influencers of what would become British Sign Language. [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) was recognized as an official language in 2003. The success of his students helped create much publicity for the school and Braidwood's methods. His use of oral methods to teach his students articulation and speech were considered impressive to the public.<ref name=\":4\" /> \n\nMany of his students, such as Charles Shireff, went on to pursue successful careers in various fields.

In 1778, Heinicke opened the first German public school for the education of the deaf. The school for deaf children established by Samuel Heinicke in Leipzig, Germany was originally called \"Electoral Saxon Institute for Mutes and Other Persons Afflicted with Speech Defects.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/heinicke-samuel.htm|title=Samuel Heinicke / American Sign Language (ASL)|website=www.lifeprint.com|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Development and expansion ===\nLike \u00c9p\u00e9e's school in France, Heinicke's institution was opened publicly to serve underprivileged deaf youth. However, unlike \u00c9p\u00e9e, Heinicke resolutely opposed the dependence on sign language and, in 1780, published a book attacking the Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e's use of sign language in the education of deaf students. He ardently advocated the oral method of deaf education made popular throughout Europe by other prominent contributors to the field, such as Johann Konrad Amman. Amman theorized that, \"The breath of life resides in the voice, transmitting enlightenment through it. The voice is the interpreter of our hearts and expresses its affections and desires.\" Like Amman, Heinicke believed a spoken language to be an indispensable aspect of a proper education. <ref name=\":3\" />  \n\n=== Instructional methodology ===\n\nHeinicke's institution in Leipzig capitalized on teaching deaf children to [[Lip reading|lipread]] and produce speech. Slight augmentations of oralist techniques cultivated by Heinicke were self-proclaimed his own \"German system\". Certain well-guarded aspects of this system utilized techniques which would remain unshared with the greater educational community until after his death. His [[Will and testament|Last Will and Testament]] revealed one of his techniques to be a method of using the [[Taste|gustatory]] and [[Olfaction|olfactory]] senses to stimulate mental associations for speech development in deaf pupils. To this approach, Heinicke asserted that, \"Sight and touch were not enough to learn the vowels; a third sense must be brought into play.\" Sugar water, olive oil, vinegar, absinthe, and pure water, were among flavors frequently paired with specific vowel sounds in attempts to create more lasting associations in his students.\n\nAlthough Heinicke alleged that his methods were of his own creation, an earlier treatise by a deaf linguist in France had been published prior to Heinicke's claims. In his autobiographical letter, [https://liblists.wrlc.org/biographies/52911 Saboureux de Fontenay] previously asserted that, \"Easily discriminable tastes can represent the sounds of letters and we can put them in the mouth as a means of getting ideas into the mind.\" <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Influences and survival of institution ===\nMany other teachers across Germany were sent by their local governments to acquire training under Heinicke at his Leipzig establishment. A young priest named Hemeling was sent by the duke of Baden, Charles Frederick to learn from Heinicke. Frederick then opened a school for the deaf in Karlsruhe, Germany. Three son-in-laws of Heinicke also played integral roles in the survival and expansion of the school in Leipzig. His first son-in-law, Ernst Adolf Eschke, established a complementary site in Berlin, before assuming directorship of Leipzig after Heinicke's death. However, Eschke turned away from the oralist methods of his father-in-law in preference of \u00c9p\u00e9e and Sicards manual sign language philosophies.<ref>{{Citation|last=G\u00fcnther|first=Klaus-B|title=Trends and Developments in Deaf Education in Germany|date=2009-01-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260120189_Trends_and_Developments_in_Deaf_Education_in_Germany|work=Deaf People Around the World: Educational and Social Perspectives|pages=178\u2013193|access-date=2020-04-01|last2=Hennies|first2=Johannes|last3=Hintermair|first3=Manfred}}</ref> The legacy in deaf education was further carried on by two more of Heinicke's son-in-laws, August Friedrich Petschke and [[:de:Carl_Gottlob_Reich|Carl Gottlob Reich]], respectively.

Among the primary influencers of this ideology was 18th century physician [[Mason Fitch Cogswell|Dr. Mason Fitch Cogswell]]. It was he who employed Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, his neighbor at the time, to pursue knowledge of deaf educational in Europe. Gaulladet initially traveled to England wherein he attempted to gain insight on oral methods from an unwilling Thomas Braidwood. He then traveled to France where he became acquainted with a system derived from French Sign Language made popular by abb\u00e9s \u00c9p\u00e9e and Sicard. He later returned to the United States, accompanied by deaf educator, [[Laurent Clerc]]. \n\nThomas Hopkins Gallaudet and the school that would become his namesake, abandoned the original pursuit to bring oralism back to America at the time. As a result, the sign language used by the French Deaf community, as well as the system of manual French, were introduced into the United States. Over time, these evolved into what is now officially recognized as its own language: [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL).]]\n\nThe preference for a sign language based modality had been adapted by the school's founders and began to root in Deaf communities across the country.  However, oral methods would eventually make their way to the US, as well. In similar controversy, Edward Miner Gallaudet would later assert that oral instruction is usually of little value to the [[Hearing loss|congenitally deaf]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dawnsign.com/news-detail/history-of-american-sign-language|title=History of American Sign Language {{!}} DawnSignPress|website=www.dawnsign.com|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Influences and Survival of Institution ===\nToday, [[Gallaudet University]] is known with prestige for being the first institute of higher learning for deaf education.

Students were also educated in various vocational trades popular during the era. The school's primary focus was on the acquisition of language. The approach made popular by \u00c9p\u00e9e was dubbed ''signes m\u00e9thodiques'' or [[Manually coded language|Methodical Sign]]. This consisted of translating French Sign Language and converting it to \u00c9p\u00e9e's French Manual alphabet. This was composed of individual hand shapes and signs used to represent specific counterparts of the written and spoken French language in a direct word for word translation. This form of methodical sign is also referred to as [[Manualism|manual sign]], or in this case [[Signed French]]. This differs explicitly from [[French Sign Language]], which is a separate language in its own right. Such methods of manual language translation remain popular today, especially in hearing-based educational approaches to deaf education.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://onlineexhibits.library.yale.edu/s/deaf-culture/page/manual-systems|title=Manually Coded Language and Alternate Sign Systems \u00b7 Yale University Library Online Exhibitions|website=onlineexhibits.library.yale.edu|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n \n=== Influences and Survival of Institution ===\n\nOn July 29, 1791 the school was renamed the [[Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris]], which it remains and is active to this day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.injs-paris.fr/page/educatif|title=Educatif|date=2013-02-28|website=INJS Paris|language=fr|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref> However, today the institution uses French Sign Language in its educational practices, as opposed to Manual French.

In 1778, Heinicke opened the first German public school for the education of the deaf. The school for deaf children established by Samuel Heinicke in Leipzig, Germany was originally called \"Electoral Saxon Institute for Mutes and Other Persons Afflicted with Speech Defects.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lifeprint.com/asl101/pages-layout/heinicke-samuel.htm|title=Samuel Heinicke / American Sign Language (ASL)|website=www.lifeprint.com|access-date=2020-03-28}}</ref>\n\n=== Development and expansion ===\nLike \u00c9p\u00e9e's school in France, Heinicke's institution was opened publicly to serve underprivileged deaf youth. However, unlike \u00c9p\u00e9e, Heinicke resolutely opposed the dependence on sign language and, in 1780, published a book attacking the Abb\u00e9 de l'\u00c9p\u00e9e's use of sign language in the education of deaf students. He ardently advocated the oral method of deaf education made popular throughout Europe by other prominent contributors to the field, such as Johann Konrad Amman. Amman theorized that, \"The breath of life resides in the voice, transmitting enlightenment through it. The voice is the interpreter of our hearts and expresses its affections and desires.\" Like Amman, Heinicke believed a spoken language to be an indispensable aspect of a proper education. <ref name=\":3\" />  \n\n=== Instructional methodology ===\n\nHeinicke's institution in Leipzig capitalized on teaching deaf children to [[Lip reading|lipread]] and produce speech. Slight augmentations of oralist techniques cultivated by Heinicke were self-proclaimed his own \"German system\". Certain well-guarded aspects of this system utilized techniques which would remain unshared with the greater educational community until after his death. His [[Will and testament|Last Will and Testament]] revealed one of his techniques to be a method of using the [[Taste|gustatory]] and [[Olfaction|olfactory]] senses to stimulate mental associations for speech development in deaf pupils. To this approach, Heinicke asserted that, \"Sight and touch were not enough to learn the vowels; a third sense must be brought into play.\" Sugar water, olive oil, vinegar, absinthe, and pure water, were among flavors frequently paired with specific vowel sounds in attempts to create more lasting associations in his students.\n\nAlthough Heinicke alleged that his methods were of his own creation, an earlier treatise by a deaf linguist in France had been published prior to Heinicke's claims. In his autobiographical letter, [https://liblists.wrlc.org/biographies/52911 Saboureux de Fontenay] previously asserted that, \"Easily discriminable tastes can represent the sounds of letters and we can put them in the mouth as a means of getting ideas into the mind.\" <ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Influences and survival of institution ===\nMany other teachers across Germany were sent by their local governments to acquire training under Heinicke at his Leipzig establishment. A young priest named Hemeling was sent by the duke of Baden, Charles Frederick to learn from Heinicke. Frederick then opened a school for the deaf in Karlsruhe, Germany. Three son-in-laws of Heinicke also played integral roles in the survival and expansion of the school in Leipzig. His first son-in-law, Ernst Adolf Eschke, established a complementary site in Berlin, before assuming directorship of Leipzig after Heinicke's death. However, Eschke turned away from the oralist methods of his father-in-law in preference of \u00c9p\u00e9e and Sicards manual sign language philosophies.<ref>{{Citation|last=G\u00fcnther|first=Klaus-B|title=Trends and Developments in Deaf Education in Germany|date=2009-01-01|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/260120189_Trends_and_Developments_in_Deaf_Education_in_Germany|work=Deaf People Around the World: Educational and Social Perspectives|pages=178\u2013193|access-date=2020-04-01|last2=Hennies|first2=Johannes|last3=Hintermair|first3=Manfred}}</ref> The legacy in deaf education was further carried on by two more of Heinicke's son-in-laws, August Friedrich Petschke and [[:de:Carl_Gottlob_Reich|Carl Gottlob Reich]], respectively.

Among the primary influencers of this ideology was 18th century physician [[Mason Fitch Cogswell|Dr. Mason Fitch Cogswell]]. It was he who employed Thomas Hopkins Gallaudet, his neighbor at the time, to pursue knowledge of deaf educational in Europe. Gaulladet initially traveled to England wherein he attempted to gain insight on oral methods from an unwilling Thomas Braidwood. He then traveled to France where he became acquainted with a system derived from French Sign Language made popular by abb\u00e9s \u00c9p\u00e9e and Sicard. He later returned to the United States, accompanied by deaf educator, [[Laurent Clerc]]. \n\nThomas Hopkins Gallaudet and the school that would become his namesake, abandoned the original pursuit to bring oralism back to America at the time. As a result, the sign language used by the French Deaf community, as well as the system of manual French, were introduced into the United States. Over time, these evolved into what is now officially recognized as its own language: [[American Sign Language|American Sign Language (ASL).]]\n\nThe preference for a sign language based modality had been adapted by the school's founders and began to root in Deaf communities across the country.  However, oral methods would eventually make their way to the US, as well. In similar controversy, Edward Miner Gallaudet would later assert that oral instruction is usually of little value to the [[Hearing loss|congenitally deaf]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.dawnsign.com/news-detail/history-of-american-sign-language|title=History of American Sign Language {{!}} DawnSignPress|website=www.dawnsign.com|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n=== Influences and Survival of Institution ===\nToday, [[Gallaudet University]] is known with prestige for being the first institute of higher learning for deaf education.

Together with his early climbing partner, [[Don Whillans]], he was one of a new breed of British post-war climbers who came from working-class backgrounds in contrast to the [[upper class|upper]] and [[middle class]] professionals who had dominated the sport up to the [[Second World War]]. Some of his climbs were televised and he assisted with mountaineering scenes in several films. Brown died on 15 April 2020 at the age of 89.\n\n==Early life==\nBrown was born the seventh and last child of a family in [[Ardwick]], [[Manchester]], England.<ref name=BMC /> His father was a builder and [[Merchant navy|merchant seaman]] who died in 1931 when Brown was eight months old. Brown's mother was forced to take in washing before she began work as a cleaner. In his autobiography, ''The Hard Years'', Brown remembered being banned from the [[Scouting|Scouts]] for refusing to go on a church parade and recalled how he began exploring the countryside \u2013 camping out, playing and climbing in old quarries. At around the age of 16 he came to [[River Kinder#Kinder Downfall|Kinder Downfall]] and, having read [[Colin Kirkus]]' ''Let's Go Climbing'', he decided to begin climbing. He reputedly borrowed his mother's old washing line to use as a rope, but Brown himself explained that, in fact, he stolen rope that had been placed around roadworks.<ref name=BMC /><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.livefortheoutdoors.com/outdoorfeatures/2016/9/30/ogrmbzbm5omiqhkmsk13ji057r7zog | title=Mountain Legends Part 2: Joe Brown | last=Ingram|first=Simon | publisher=Trail Magazine | date=2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter leaving school he trained as an apprentice plumber and general builder, working for a plumber and\ngeneral builder called Archie.<ref name=\"Joe Brown Biography 2012\">[https://web.archive.org/web/20120512003631/http://www.joe-brown.com/docman/joe-brown/joe-browns-biography/download.html \"Joe Brown Biography\"] Joe-Brown.com.</ref> In 1949\u201350, he was [[Conscription in the United Kingdom#After 1945|enlisted]] for 18 months in the [[Royal Army Ordnance Corps]], where he spent his free time climbing with friends.
