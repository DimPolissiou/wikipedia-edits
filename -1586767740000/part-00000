He was the last king of the [[House of York]] and the last of the [[Plantagenet dynasty]]. His defeat and death at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], the last decisive battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]], marked the end of the [[Middle Ages in England]]. He is the protagonist of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', one of [[William Shakespeare]]'s history plays.\n\nWhen his brother [[Edward IV]] died in April 1483, Richard was named [[Lord Protector]] of the realm for Edward's eldest son and successor, the 12-year-old [[Edward V]]. Arrangements were made for Edward's coronation on 22 June 1483. Before the king could be crowned, the marriage of his parents was declared [[bigamous]] and therefore invalid. Now officially illegitimate, their children were barred from inheriting the throne. On 25 June, an assembly of lords and commoners endorsed a declaration to this effect and proclaimed Richard as the rightful king. He was crowned on 6 July 1483. The [[Princes in the Tower|young princes]], Edward and his younger brother [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], were not seen in public after August and accusations circulated that they had been murdered on Richard's orders.\n\nThere were two major rebellions against Richard during his reign. In October 1483, an unsuccessful revolt was led by staunch allies of Edward IV and Richard's former ally, [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]]. Then in August 1485, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] and his uncle, [[Jasper Tudor]], landed in southern [[Wales]] with a contingent of French troops and marched through [[Pembrokeshire]], recruiting soldiers. Henry's forces defeated Richard's army near the [[Leicestershire]] town of [[Market Bosworth]]. Richard was slain, making him the last English king to die in battle. Henry Tudor then ascended the throne as Henry VII.\n\nRichard's corpse was taken to the nearby town of [[Leicester]] and buried without pomp. His original tomb monument is believed to have been removed during the [[English Reformation]], and his remains were lost, as they were believed to have been thrown into the [[River Soar]]. In 2012, [[Exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England|an archaeological excavation]] was commissioned by the [[Richard III Society]] on the site previously occupied by [[Greyfriars, Leicester|Greyfriars Priory Church]]. The [[University of Leicester]] identified the skeleton found in the excavation as that of Richard III as a result of [[radiocarbon dating]], comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance, and comparison of his [[mitochondrial DNA]] with that of two matrilineal descendants of his eldest sister, [[Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter]]. He was reburied in [[Leicester Cathedral]] on 26 March 2015.\n\n==Early life==\nRichard was born on 2 October 1452 at [[Fotheringhay Castle]] in [[Northamptonshire]], the eleventh of the twelve children of [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and [[Cecily Neville]], and the youngest to survive infancy.{{sfn|Baldwin|2013|p=}} His childhood coincided with the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the '[[Wars of the Roses]]', a period of political instability and periodic open civil war in [[England in the Middle Ages|England]] during the second half of the fifteenth century,{{sfnp|Pollard|2000|p=15}} between the [[House of York|Yorkists]], who supported Richard's father (a potential claimant to the throne of [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] from birth),{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=3\u20135}} and opposed the regime of Henry VI and his wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]],{{sfnp|Pollard|2008}} and the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]], who were loyal to the crown.{{sfnp|Griffiths|2008}} In 1459, his father and the Yorkists were forced to flee England, whereupon Richard and his older brother [[George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence|George]] were placed in the custody of their aunt [[Anne Neville, Duchess of Buckingham|the Duchess of Buckingham]], and possibly of the [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Archbishop of Canterbury]].{{sfn|Horrox|2013}}\n\nWhen their father and elder brother [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], were killed at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] on 30 December 1460, Richard and George were sent by their mother to the [[Low Countries]].{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|pp=41\u201342}} They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the [[Battle of Towton]]. They participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]] on 28 June 1461, when Richard was named [[Duke of Gloucester]] and made both a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] and a [[Order of the Bath#Knights of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]]. Edward appointed him the sole [[Commissioner of Array]] for the Western Counties in 1464 when he was 11. By the age of 17, he had an independent command.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|p=40}}\n\n[[File:MiddlehamCJW.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the twelfth-century castle at [[Middleham Castle|Middleham]] in [[Wensleydale]] where Richard was raised]]\n\nRichard spent several years during his childhood at [[Middleham Castle]] in [[Wensleydale]], Yorkshire, under the tutelage of his cousin the [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], later known as 'the Kingmaker' because of his role in the Wars of the Roses. Warwick supervised Richard's training as a [[knight]]; in the autumn of 1465 Edward IV granted Warwick \u00a31000 for the expenses of his younger brother's tutelage.{{sfnp|Scofield|2016|loc=p. 216, n.6|ps=, quoting Tellers' Roll, Mich. 5 Edw.

It may have been partly to appease Warwick's injured feelings towards the rising influence of the king's new Woodville in-laws that he was given the honour of taking Richard into his household to complete his education, probably at some time in 1465\".{{sfnp|Baldwin|2013|pp=36\u201337, 240}}|group=note}} While at Warwick's estate, it is likely that he met both [[Francis Lovell, Viscount Lovell|Francis Lovell]], who would be his firm supporter later in his life, and Warwick's younger daughter, his future wife [[Anne Neville]].{{sfnp|Ross|1974|p=9}}\n\nIt is possible that even at this early stage Warwick was considering the king's brothers as strategic matches for his daughters, [[Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence|Isabel]] and Anne: young aristocrats were often sent to be raised in the households of their intended future partners,{{sfnp|Licence|2013|p=63}} as had been the case for the young dukes' father, Richard of York.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|pp=16\u201317}} As the relationship between the king and Warwick became strained, Edward IV opposed the match.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|p=68}} During Warwick's lifetime, George was the only royal brother to marry one of his daughters, the eldest, Isabel, on 12 July 1469, without the king's permission. George joined his father-in-law's revolt against the king,{{sfnp|Hicks|1980|p=45}} while Richard remained loyal to Edward, even though rumour coupled Richard's name with Anne Neville until August 1469.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|p=522}}{{refn|1=As late as 1469 rumours were still linking Richard's name with Anne Neville's. In August of that year, by which time Clarence had married Isabel, an Italian observer in London mistakenly reported that Warwick had married his two daughters to the King's brothers (''Cal. Milanese Papers, I'', pp. 118\u2013120).|group=note}}\n\nRichard and Edward were forced to flee to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] in October 1470 after Warwick defected to the side of the former Lancastrian queen Margaret of Anjou. In 1468, Richard's sister [[Margaret of York|Margaret]] had married [[Charles the Bold]], the Duke of Burgundy, and the brothers could expect a welcome there. Edward was restored to the throne in the spring of 1471, following the battles of [[Battle of Barnet|Barnet]] and [[Battle of Tewkesbury|Tewkesbury]], in both of which the eighteen-year-old Richard played a crucial role.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|pp=87\u201389}}\n\nDuring his adolescence, and due to a cause that is unknown, Richard developed a [[Scoliosis|sideways curvature of the spine]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Spine |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/spine.html |website=The Discovery of Richard III |publisher=[[University of Leicester]] |accessdate=5 February 2013 |quote=A very pronounced curve in the spine was visible when the body was first uncovered, evidence of scoliosis which may have meant that Richard's right shoulder was noticeably higher than his left....The type of scoliosis seen here is known as idiopathic adolescent onset scoliosis.

The East Anglian Paston family have left historians a rich source of historical information for the lives of the English gentry of the period in a large collection of surviving letters.}} The reason was the inheritance Anne shared with her elder sister Isabel, whom George had married in 1469. It was not only the earldom that was at stake; Richard Neville had inherited it as a result of his marriage to [[Anne Neville, 16th Countess of Warwick|Anne Beauchamp]], who was still alive (and outlived both her daughters) and was technically the owner of the substantial Beauchamp estates, her own father having left no male heirs.{{sfnp|Hicks|2009|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThe [[Croyland Chronicle]] records that Richard agreed to a prenuptial contract in the following terms: \"the marriage of the Duke of Gloucester with Anne before-named was to take place, and he was to have such and so much of the earl's lands as should be agreed upon between them through the mediation of arbitrators; while all the rest were to remain in the possession of the Duke of Clarence\".{{sfnp|Riley|1908|p=470}}\n\nThe date of Paston's letter suggests the marriage was still being negotiated in February 1472. In order to win his brother George's final consent to the marriage, Richard renounced most of Warwick's land and property including the earldoms of Warwick (which the Kingmaker had held in his wife's right) and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956}} Richard retained Neville's forfeit estates he had already been granted in the summer of 1471:{{sfnp|Baldwin|2013|p=58}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Properties and Influence |url=http://richardiii-ipup.org.uk/riii/46 |website=Richard III: Rumour and Reality |publisher=[[Institute for the Public Understanding of the Past]], [[University of York]] |at=CPR 1467\u201377, p. 260|accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> Penrith, Sheriff Hutton and Middleham, where he later established his marital household.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|p=128}}\n\n[[File:King Richard III and Queen Anne.jpg|thumb|[[Stained glass]] depiction of Richard and Anne Neville in [[Cardiff Castle]]]]\n\nThe requisite Papal dispensation was obtained dated 22 April 1472.{{sfnp|Clarke|2005|p=1023|ps=. \"In fact, [Richard and Anne] had sought a dispensation to marry from the penitentiary in early 1472, for it was granted on 22 April that year, and they probably married shortly afterwards.\"}} [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] has suggested that the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel.{{sfnp|Hicks|2006}} First-degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon.

Neither the birth dates nor the names of the mothers of either of the children is known. Katherine was old enough to be wedded in 1484, when the age of consent was twelve, and John was knighted in September 1483 in [[York Minster]], and so most historians agree that they were both fathered when Richard was a teenager.{{sfnp|Ashdown-Hill|2013}}{{sfnp|Baldwin|2013|p=42}} There is no evidence of infidelity on Richard's part after his marriage to Anne Neville in 1472 when he was around 20.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|p=387}} This has led to a suggestion by the historian [[A.

Richard visited Pontefract from 1471, in April and October 1473, and in early March 1474, for a week. On 1 March 1474, he granted Alice Burgh \u00a320 a year for life \"for certain special causes and considerations\".

All these characteristics are repeated by Shakespeare, who portrays him as having a hunch, a limp and a withered arm.{{sfnp|Shakespeare|n.d.|loc=''Henry VI, Part 3'', act 3, scene 2, lines 155\u2013161|ps=.{{blockindent |Why, Love forswore me in my mother's womb,<br>\nAnd, for I should not deal in her soft laws,<br>\nShe did corrupt frail nature with some bribe<br>\nTo shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;<br>\nTo make an envious mountain on my back,<br>\nWhere sits deformity to mock my body;<br>\nTo shape my legs of an unequal size;}}}}{{sfnp|Clemen|1977|p=51}} With regard to the \"hunch\", the [[List of Shakespeare plays in quarto|second quarto]] edition of ''Richard III'' (1598) used the term \"hunched-backed\" but in the [[First Folio]] edition (1623) it became \"bunch-backed\".{{sfnp|Shipley|1984|p=127}}\n\nRichard's reputation as a promoter of legal fairness persisted, however. [[William Camden]] in his ''Remains Concerning Britain'' (1605) states that Richard, \"albeit he lived wickedly, yet made good laws\".{{sfnp|Camden|1870|p=293}} [[Francis Bacon]] also states that he was \"a good lawmaker for the ease and solace of the common people\".{{sfnp|Bacon|Lumby|1885}} In 1525, Cardinal Wolsey upbraided the aldermen and Mayor of London for relying on a statute of Richard to avoid paying an extorted tax (benevolence) but received the reply 'although he did evil, yet in his time were many good acts made.'{{sfnp|Potter|1994|p=23}}{{sfnp|Baldwin|2013|p=217}}\n\nDespite this, the image of Richard as a ruthless power-grabber remained dominant in the 18th and 19th centuries. The 18th century [[philosopher]] and [[historian]] [[David Hume]] described him as a man who used dissimulation to conceal \"his fierce and savage nature\" and who had \"abandoned all principles of honour and humanity\".{{sfnp|Hume|1864|pp=345\u2013346}} Hume acknowledged that some historians have argued \"that he was well qualified for government, had he legally obtained it; and that he committed no crimes but such as were necessary to procure him possession of the crown\", but he dismissed this view on the grounds that Richard's exercise of arbitrary power encouraged instability.{{sfnp|Hume|1864|p=365}} The most important late 19th-century biographer of the king was [[James Gairdner]], who also wrote the entry on Richard in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.{{sfnp|Gairdner|1896}} Gairdner stated that he had begun to study Richard with a neutral viewpoint, but became convinced that Shakespeare and More were essentially correct in their view of the king, despite some exaggerations.{{sfnp|Gairdner|1898|p=xi}}\n\nRichard was not without his defenders, the first of whom was George Buck, a descendant of one of the king's supporters, who completed  a historical account of Richard's life in 1619. Buck attacked the \"improbable imputations and strange and spiteful scandals\" related by Tudor writers, including Richard's alleged deformities and murders. He located lost archival material, including the ''Titulus Regius'', but also claimed to have seen a letter written by Elizabeth of York, according to which Elizabeth sought to marry the king.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elizabeth of York |url=http://www.r3.org/basics/basic8.html |publisher=Richard III Society, American Branch |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408084900/http://www.r3.org:80/on-line-library-text-essays/back-to-basics-for-newcomers/elizabeth-of-york/ |archive-date=8 April 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=6 December 2018 }}</ref> Though the book was published in 1646, Elizabeth's supposed letter was never produced. Documents which later emerged from the Portuguese Royal archives show that after Queen Anne's death, Richard's ambassadors were sent on a formal errand to negotiate a double marriage between Richard and the Portuguese King's sister [[Joanna, Princess of Portugal|Joana]],{{sfn|Horrox|2013}} of Lancastrian descent,{{sfn|Williams|1983|p=139}} and between Elizabeth of York and Joana's cousin Duke [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel]] (later King of Portugal).{{sfnp|Ashdown-Hill|2013}}\n\nSignificant among Richard's defenders was [[Horace Walpole]]. In ''Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard the Third'' (1768), Walpole disputed all the alleged murders and argued that Richard may have acted in good faith. He also argued that any physical abnormality was probably no more than a minor distortion of the shoulders.{{sfnp|Walpole|1798|loc=''Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard the Third'', pp. 103\u2013184}} However, he retracted his views in 1793 after [[the Terror]], stating he now believed that Richard could have committed the crimes he was charged with,{{sfnp|Walpole|1798|loc=''Postscript to my Historic Doubts, written in February 1793'', pp. 220\u2013251}} although Pollard observes that this retraction is frequently overlooked by later admirers of Richard.{{sfnp|Pollard|1991|p=216}} Other defenders of Richard include the noted explorer [[Clements Markham]], whose ''Richard III: His Life and Character'' (1906) replied to the work of Gairdner. He argued that Henry VII killed the princes and that the bulk of evidence against Richard was nothing more than Tudor propaganda.{{sfn|Myers|1968|pp=199\u2013200}} An intermediate view was provided by Alfred Legge in ''The Unpopular King'' (1885). Legge argued that Richard's \"greatness of soul\" was eventually \"warped and dwarfed\" by the ingratitude of others.{{sfnp|Legge|1885|p=viii}}\n\nSome twentieth-century historians have been less inclined to moral judgement,{{sfnp|Myers|1968|pp=200\u2013202}} seeing Richard's actions as a product of the unstable times. In the words of [[Charles Ross (historian)|Charles Ross]], \"the later fifteenth century in England is now seen as a ruthless and violent age as concerns the upper ranks of society, full of private feuds, intimidation, land-hunger, and litigiousness, and consideration of Richard's life and career against this background has tended to remove him from the lonely pinnacle of Villainy Incarnate on which Shakespeare had placed him. Like most men, he was conditioned by the standards of his age.\"{{sfnp|Ross|1981|p=liii}} The [[Richard III Society]], founded in 1924 as \"The Fellowship of the White Boar\", is the oldest of several groups dedicated to improving his reputation.  Other contemporary historians still describe him as, a \"power-hungry and ruthless politician\" who was still most probably \"ultimately responsible for the murder of his nephews.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Hebron |first=Michael |date=15 March 2016 |title=Richard III and the Will to Power |url=https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/richard-iii-and-the-will-to-power |website=Discovering Literature: Shakespeare & Renaissance |publisher=[[British Library]] |access-date=23 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hogenboom |first=Melissa |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19572103 |title=Richard III: The people who want everyone to like the infamous king |website=[[BBC News Magazine]] |location=London |date=15 September 2012 |access-date=23 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===In culture===\n{{main|Cultural depictions of Richard III of England}}\n\n[[File:The True Tragedy of Richard the Third.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cover of the 1594 [[quarto]] of the anonymous play, ''[[The True Tragedy of Richard III]]''.]]\n\nApart from Shakespeare, Richard appears in many other works of literature.

Both portray him as a man motivated by personal ambition, who uses everyone around him to get his way.

Additionally, there was an object that appeared to be an arrowhead embedded in the spine; and there were [[wikt:perimortem|perimortem]] injuries to the skull. These included a relatively shallow orifice, which is most likely to have been caused by a [[rondel dagger]], and a scooping depression to the skull, inflicted by a bladed weapon, most probably a sword. Additionally, the bottom of the skull presented a gaping hole, where a [[halberd]] had cut away and entered it. \n\nForensic pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton stated that this injury would have left the individual's brain visible, and most certainly would have been the cause of death. Dr Jo Appleby, the osteo-archaeologist who excavated the skeleton, concurred and described the latter as \"a mortal battlefield wound in the back of the skull\". The base of the skull also presented another fatal wound in which a bladed weapon had been thrust into it, leaving behind a jagged hole. Closer examination of the interior of the skull revealed a mark opposite this wound, showing that the blade penetrated to a depth of {{convert|10.5|cm}}.<ref>{{cite web |title=Skull |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/osteologyskull.html |website=The Discovery of Richard III |publisher=[[University of Leicester]] |access-date=3 December 2014}}</ref> \n\nIn total, the skeleton presented ten wounds: four minor injuries on the top of the skull, one dagger blow on the cheekbone, one cut on the lower jaw, two fatal injuries on the base of the skull, one cut on a rib bone, and one final wound on the pelvis, most probably inflicted after death. It is generally accepted that postmortem, Richard's naked body was tied to the back of a horse, with his arms slung over one side and his legs and buttocks over the other. This presented a tempting target for onlookers, and the angle of the blow on the pelvis suggests that one of them stabbed Richard's right buttock with substantial force, as the cut extends from the back all the way to the front of the pelvic bone and was most probably an act of humiliation. It is also possible that Richard suffered other injuries which left no trace on the skeleton.<ref>{{cite web |title=Osteology |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/osteology.html |website=The Discovery of Richard III |publisher=[[University of Leicester]] |access-date=3 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= Injuries to Body |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/osteologybody.html |website=The Discovery of Richard III |publisher=[[University of Leicester]] |access-date=3 December 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Burns |first=John F. |author-link=John Fisher Burns |title=DNA could cleanse a king besmirched; tests of skeletal remains may bring re-evaluation of the reviled Richard III |url=https://www.questia.com/newspaper/1P2-36291789/dna-could-cleanse-a-king-besmirched-tests-of-skeletal |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]] |location=La D\u00e9fense, France |date=24 September 2012 |via=[[Questia Online Library|Questia]] (article excerpt)}}</ref>\n\nBritish historian John Ashdown-Hill had used [[genealogy|genealogical research]] in 2004 to trace [[matrilineality|matrilineal]] descendants of [[Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter|Anne of York]], Richard's elder sister.<ref>{{cite news |last=Kennedy |first=Maev |authorlink=Maev Kennedy |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/feb/04/richard-iii-dna-bones-king |title=Richard III: DNA confirms twisted bones belong to king |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=<!--Guardian Media Group (omitted as substantially similar to newspaper name)--> |location=London |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref><ref name=\"BBC DNA\">{{cite news |author=<!--no credited author--> |title=Richard III dig: DNA confirms bones are king |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-21063882 |website=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]] |publisher=<!--BBC (omitted as substantially similar to website name)--> |location=London |date=4 February 2013 |accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Fricker |first=Martin |date=5 February 2013 |title=Edinburgh-based writer reveals how her intuition led archaeologists to remains of King Richard III |url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/writer-reveals-intuition-led-archaeologists-1586462 |newspaper=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |publisher=Trinity Mirror |location=Glasgow |access-date=5 February 2013}}</ref> <ref>{{cite web |title=Lines of Descent |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/genealogy.html |website=The Discovery of Richard III |publisher=[[University of Leicester]] |accessdate=7 February 2013}}</ref> A British-born woman who emigrated to Canada after the [[Second World War]], Joy Ibsen ({{n\u00e9e|Brown}}), was found to be a 16th-generation great-niece of the king in the same direct maternal line.<ref>{{cite web |title=Female-Line Family Tree |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/familytree.html |website=The Discovery of Richard III |publisher=[[University of Leicester]] |access-date=4 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite episode |last1=Ashdown-Hill |first1=John |author1-link=John Ashdown-Hill |last2=Davis |first2=Evans |author2-link=Evan Davis |date=4 February 2013 |title=Richard III dig: 'It does look like him' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-21319332 |medium=Radio programme |series=Today |series-link=Today (BBC Radio 4) |network=[[BBC Radio 4]] |location=London |access-date=7 February 2013 |via=[[BBC News Online|BBC News]]}}</ref> Joy Ibsen's mitochondrial DNA was tested and belongs to [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|mitochondrial DNA haplogroup J]], which by deduction, should also be the mitochondrial DNA haplogroup of Richard III.{{sfnp|Ashdown-Hill|2013}} Joy Ibsen died in 2008.

The team concluded that it is unlikely that the king was wearing a helmet in his last moments. Soil taken from the remains was found to contain microscopic [[Ascaris lumbricoides|roundworm]] eggs. Several eggs were found in samples taken from the pelvis, where the king's intestines were, but not from the skull and only very small numbers were identified in soil surrounding the grave. The findings suggest that the higher concentration of eggs in the pelvic area probably arose from a roundworm infection the King suffered in his life, rather than from human waste dumped in the area at a later date, researchers said. The Mayor of Leicester announced that the king's skeleton would be re-interred at [[Leicester Cathedral]] in early 2014, but a judicial review of that decision delayed the reinterment for a year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Warzynski |first=Peter A. |date=23 May 2014 |title=Richard III: Leicester wins the battle of the bones |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Richard-III-Leicester-win-battle-bones/story-21132993-detail/story.html |newspaper=[[Leicester Mercury]] |publisher=Local World |location=<!--Leicester, England (omitted as given by newspaper name)--> |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524043912/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Richard-III-Leicester-win-battle-bones/story-21132993-detail/story.html |archive-date=24 May 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=23 May 2014}}</ref> A museum to Richard III was opened in July 2014 in the Victorian school buildings next to the Greyfriars grave site.<ref name=\"BBC DNA\"/><ref name=\"LU-results-announced\">{{cite web|title=Richard III DNA results announced \u2013 Leicester University reveals identity of human remains found in car park|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/LIVE-UPDATES-Richard-III-DNA-results-announced/story-18041484-detail/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421124125/http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/LIVE-UPDATES-Richard-III-DNA-results-announced/story-18041484-detail/story.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 April 2013|work=[[Leicester Mercury]] |location=<!--Leicester, England (omitted as given by newspaper name)--> |accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kriii.com/january-opening/ |title=News: January Opening |publisher=King Richard III Visitor Centre |date=29 December 2014 |accessdate=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204215709/http://kriii.com/january-opening/ |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe proposal to have King Richard buried in Leicester attracted some controversy.

and [[Lord of Ireland]] from 1483 until his death in 1485. He was the last king of the [[House of York]] and the last of the [[Plantagenet dynasty]]. His defeat and death at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]], the last decisive battle of the [[Wars of the Roses]], marked the end of the [[Middle Ages in England]]. He is the protagonist of ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]'', one of [[William Shakespeare]]'s history plays.\n\nWhen his brother [[Edward IV]] died in April 1483, Richard was named [[Lord Protector]] of the realm for Edward's eldest son and successor, the 12-year-old [[Edward V]]. Arrangements were made for Edward's coronation on 22 June 1483. Before the king could be crowned, the marriage of his parents was declared [[bigamous]] and therefore invalid. Now officially illegitimate, their children were barred from inheriting the throne. On 25 June, an assembly of lords and commoners endorsed a declaration to this effect and proclaimed Richard as the rightful king. He was crowned on 6 July 1483. The [[Princes in the Tower|young princes]], Edward and his younger brother [[Richard of Shrewsbury, 1st Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], were not seen in public after August and accusations circulated that they had been murdered on Richard's orders.\n\nThere were two major rebellions against Richard during his reign. In October 1483, an unsuccessful revolt was led by staunch allies of Edward IV and Richard's former ally, [[Henry Stafford, 2nd Duke of Buckingham]]. Then in August 1485, [[Henry VII of England|Henry Tudor]] and his uncle, [[Jasper Tudor]], landed in southern [[Wales]] with a contingent of French troops and marched through [[Pembrokeshire]], recruiting soldiers. Henry's forces defeated Richard's army near the [[Leicestershire]] town of [[Market Bosworth]]. Richard was slain, making him the last English king to die in battle. Henry Tudor then ascended the throne as Henry VII.\n\nRichard's corpse was taken to the nearby town of [[Leicester]] and buried without pomp. His original tomb monument is believed to have been removed during the [[English Reformation]], and his remains were lost, as they were believed to have been thrown into the [[River Soar]]. In 2012, [[Exhumation and reburial of Richard III of England|an archaeological excavation]] was commissioned by the [[Richard III Society]] on the site previously occupied by [[Greyfriars, Leicester|Greyfriars Priory Church]]. The [[University of Leicester]] identified the skeleton found in the excavation as that of Richard III as a result of [[radiocarbon dating]], comparison with contemporary reports of his appearance, and comparison of his [[mitochondrial DNA]] with that of two matrilineal descendants of his eldest sister, [[Anne of York, Duchess of Exeter]]. He was reburied in [[Leicester Cathedral]] on 26 March 2015.\n\n==Early life==\nRichard was born on 2 October 1452 at [[Fotheringhay Castle]] in [[Northamptonshire]], the eleventh of the twelve children of [[Richard, 3rd Duke of York|Richard, Duke of York]], and [[Cecily Neville]], and the youngest to survive infancy.{{sfn|Baldwin|2013|p=}} His childhood coincided with the beginning of what has traditionally been labelled the '[[Wars of the Roses]]', a period of political instability and periodic open civil war in [[England in the Middle Ages|England]] during the second half of the fifteenth century,{{sfnp|Pollard|2000|p=15}} between the [[House of York|Yorkists]], who supported Richard's father (a potential claimant to the throne of [[Henry VI of England|King Henry VI]] from birth),{{sfn|Ross|1974|pp=3\u20135}} and opposed the regime of Henry VI and his wife, [[Margaret of Anjou]],{{sfnp|Pollard|2008}} and the [[House of Lancaster|Lancastrians]], who were loyal to the crown.{{sfnp|Griffiths|2008}} In 1459, his father and the Yorkists were forced to flee England, whereupon Richard and his older brother [[George Plantagenet, Duke of Clarence|George]] were placed in the custody of their aunt [[Anne Neville, Duchess of Buckingham|the Duchess of Buckingham]], and possibly of the [[Thomas Bourchier (cardinal)|Archbishop of Canterbury]].{{sfn|Horrox|2013}}\n\nWhen their father and elder brother [[Edmund, Earl of Rutland]], were killed at the [[Battle of Wakefield]] on 30 December 1460, Richard and George were sent by their mother to the [[Low Countries]].{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|pp=41\u201342}} They returned to England following the defeat of the Lancastrians at the [[Battle of Towton]]. They participated in the coronation of Richard's eldest brother as [[Edward IV of England|King Edward IV]] on 28 June 1461, when Richard was named [[Duke of Gloucester]] and made both a [[Order of the Garter|Knight of the Garter]] and a [[Order of the Bath#Knights of the Bath|Knight of the Bath]]. Edward appointed him the sole [[Commissioner of Array]] for the Western Counties in 1464 when he was 11. By the age of 17, he had an independent command.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|p=40}}\n\n[[File:MiddlehamCJW.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the twelfth-century castle at [[Middleham Castle|Middleham]] in [[Wensleydale]] where Richard was raised]]\n\nRichard spent several years during his childhood at [[Middleham Castle]] in [[Wensleydale]], Yorkshire, under the tutelage of his cousin the [[Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick|Earl of Warwick]], later known as 'the Kingmaker' because of his role in the Wars of the Roses. Warwick supervised Richard's training as a [[knight]]; in the autumn of 1465 Edward IV granted Warwick \u00a31000 for the expenses of his younger brother's tutelage.{{sfnp|Scofield|2016|loc=p. 216, n.6|ps=, quoting Tellers' Roll, Mich. 5 Edw.

It may have been partly to appease Warwick's injured feelings towards the rising influence of the king's new Woodville in-laws that he was given the honour of taking Richard into his household to complete his education, probably at some time in 1465\".{{sfnp|Baldwin|2013|pp=36\u201337, 240}}|group=note}} While at Warwick's estate, it is likely that he met both [[Francis Lovell, Viscount Lovell|Francis Lovell]], who would be his firm supporter later in his life, and Warwick's younger daughter, his future wife [[Anne Neville]].{{sfnp|Ross|1974|p=9}}\n\nIt is possible that even at this early stage Warwick was considering the king's brothers as strategic matches for his daughters, [[Isabel Neville, Duchess of Clarence|Isabel]] and Anne: young aristocrats were often sent to be raised in the households of their intended future partners,{{sfnp|Licence|2013|p=63}} as had been the case for the young dukes' father, Richard of York.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|pp=16\u201317}} As the relationship between the king and Warwick became strained, Edward IV opposed the match.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|p=68}} During Warwick's lifetime, George was the only royal brother to marry one of his daughters, the eldest, Isabel, on 12 July 1469, without the king's permission. George joined his father-in-law's revolt against the king,{{sfnp|Hicks|1980|p=45}} while Richard remained loyal to Edward, even though rumour coupled Richard's name with Anne Neville until August 1469.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|p=522}}{{refn|1=As late as 1469 rumours were still linking Richard's name with Anne Neville's. In August of that year, by which time Clarence had married Isabel, an Italian observer in London mistakenly reported that Warwick had married his two daughters to the King's brothers (''Cal. Milanese Papers, I'', pp. 118\u2013120).|group=note}}\n\nRichard and Edward were forced to flee to [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] in October 1470 after Warwick defected to the side of the former Lancastrian queen Margaret of Anjou. In 1468, Richard's sister [[Margaret of York|Margaret]] had married [[Charles the Bold]], the Duke of Burgundy, and the brothers could expect a welcome there. Edward was restored to the throne in the spring of 1471, following the battles of [[Battle of Barnet|Barnet]] and [[Battle of Tewkesbury|Tewkesbury]], in both of which the eighteen-year-old Richard played a crucial role.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|pp=87\u201389}}\n\nDuring his adolescence, and due to a cause that is unknown, Richard developed a [[Scoliosis|sideways curvature of the spine]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Spine |url=http://www.le.ac.uk/richardiii/science/spine.html |website=The Discovery of Richard III |publisher=[[University of Leicester]] |accessdate=5 February 2013 |quote=A very pronounced curve in the spine was visible when the body was first uncovered, evidence of scoliosis which may have meant that Richard's right shoulder was noticeably higher than his left....The type of scoliosis seen here is known as idiopathic adolescent onset scoliosis.

The East Anglian Paston family have left historians a rich source of historical information for the lives of the English gentry of the period in a large collection of surviving letters.}} The reason was the inheritance Anne shared with her elder sister Isabel, whom George had married in 1469. It was not only the earldom that was at stake; Richard Neville had inherited it as a result of his marriage to [[Anne Neville, 16th Countess of Warwick|Anne Beauchamp]], who was still alive (and outlived both her daughters) and was technically the owner of the substantial Beauchamp estates, her own father having left no male heirs.{{sfnp|Hicks|2009|pp=81\u201382}}\n\nThe [[Croyland Chronicle]] records that Richard agreed to a prenuptial contract in the following terms: \"the marriage of the Duke of Gloucester with Anne before-named was to take place, and he was to have such and so much of the earl's lands as should be agreed upon between them through the mediation of arbitrators; while all the rest were to remain in the possession of the Duke of Clarence\".{{sfnp|Riley|1908|p=470}}\n\nThe date of Paston's letter suggests the marriage was still being negotiated in February 1472. In order to win his brother George's final consent to the marriage, Richard renounced most of Warwick's land and property including the earldoms of Warwick (which the Kingmaker had held in his wife's right) and Salisbury and surrendered to Clarence the office of Great Chamberlain of England.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956}} Richard retained Neville's forfeit estates he had already been granted in the summer of 1471:{{sfnp|Baldwin|2013|p=58}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Northern Properties and Influence |url=http://richardiii-ipup.org.uk/riii/46 |website=Richard III: Rumour and Reality |publisher=[[Institute for the Public Understanding of the Past]], [[University of York]] |at=CPR 1467\u201377, p. 260|accessdate=7 September 2014}}</ref> Penrith, Sheriff Hutton and Middleham, where he later established his marital household.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|p=128}}\n\n[[File:King Richard III and Queen Anne.jpg|thumb|[[Stained glass]] depiction of Richard and Anne Neville in [[Cardiff Castle]]]]\n\nThe requisite Papal dispensation was obtained dated 22 April 1472.{{sfnp|Clarke|2005|p=1023|ps=. \"In fact, [Richard and Anne] had sought a dispensation to marry from the penitentiary in early 1472, for it was granted on 22 April that year, and they probably married shortly afterwards.\"}} [[Michael Hicks (historian)|Michael Hicks]] has suggested that the terms of the dispensation deliberately understated the degrees of consanguinity between the couple, and the marriage was therefore illegal on the ground of first degree consanguinity following George's marriage to Anne's sister Isabel.{{sfnp|Hicks|2006}} First-degree consanguinity applied in the case of Henry VIII and his brother's widow Catherine of Aragon. In their case, the papal dispensation was obtained after Catherine declared the first marriage had not been consummated.{{sfnp|Scarisbrick|1968|p=8}} In Richard's case, there would have been first-degree consanguinity if Richard had sought to marry Isabel (in case of widowhood) after she had married his brother George, but no such consanguinity applied for Anne and Richard. Richard's marriage to Anne was never declared null, and it was public to everyone including secular and canon lawyers for 13 years.{{sfnp|Barnfield|2007|p=85}}\n\nIn June 1473, Richard persuaded his mother-in-law to leave the sanctuary and come to live under his protection at Middleham. Later in the year, under the terms of the 1473 Act of Resumption,{{sfnp|Cobbett|1807|p=431}} George lost some of the property he held under royal grant and made no secret of his displeasure. John Paston's letter of November 1473 says that the king planned to put both his younger brothers in their place by acting as \"a stifler atween them\".{{sfnp|Ross|1974|p=190}}\n\nEarly in 1474, Parliament assembled and King Edward attempted to reconcile his brothers by stating that both men, and their wives, would enjoy the Warwick inheritance just as if the Countess of Warwick \"was naturally dead\".{{sfnp|Ross|1981|p=30}} The doubts cast by Clarence on the validity of Richard and Anne's marriage were addressed by a clause protecting their rights in the event they were divorced (i.e. of their marriage being declared null and void by the Church) and then legally remarried to each other, and also protected Richard's rights while waiting for such a valid second marriage with Anne.{{sfnp|Given-Wilson|Brand|Phillips|Ormrod|2005|loc=\"Edward IV: October 1472, Second Roll\", items 20\u201324}} The following year, Richard was rewarded with all the Neville lands in the north of England, at the expense of Anne's cousin, [[George Neville, 1st Duke of Bedford|George Neville]].{{sfnp|Ross|1981|p=31}} From this point, Clarence seems to have fallen steadily out of King Edward's favour, his discontent coming to a head in 1477 when, following Isabel's death, he was denied the opportunity to marry [[Mary of Burgundy]], the stepdaughter of his sister Margaret, even though Margaret approved the proposed match.{{sfnp|Hicks|1980|p=132}} There is no evidence of Richard's involvement in George's subsequent conviction and execution on a charge of treason.{{sfnp|Hicks|1980|p=146}}\n\n==Reign of Edward IV==\n\n===Estates and titles===\nRichard was granted the Duchy of Gloucester on 1 November 1461,{{sfnp|Ross|1981|p=6}} and on 12 August the next year was awarded large estates in [[northern England]], including the lordships of [[Richmond, Yorkshire|Richmond]] in Yorkshire, and [[Pembroke, Pembrokeshire|Pembroke]] in Wales. He gained the forfeited lands of the Lancastrian [[John de Vere, 12th Earl of Oxford|John de Vere, Earl of Oxford]], in [[East Anglia]]. In 1462, on his birthday, he was made Constable of [[Gloucester Castle|Gloucester]] and [[Corfe Castle]]s and Admiral of England, Ireland and Aquitaine{{sfnp|Ross|1981|p=9}} and appointed Governor of the North, becoming the richest and most powerful noble in England. On 17 October 1469, he was made [[Constable of England]]. In November, he replaced [[William Hastings, 1st Baron Hastings]], as Chief Justice of North Wales. The following year, he was appointed Chief Steward and Chamberlain of Wales.{{sfnp|Ross|1974|p=136}} On 18 May 1471, Richard was named Great Chamberlain and [[Lord High Admiral of England]]. Other positions followed: [[High Sheriff of Cumberland]] for life, Lieutenant of the North and Commander-in-Chief against the Scots and hereditary Warden of the West March.{{sfnp|Hicks|2001|p=74}} Two months later, on 14 July, he gained the Lordships of the strongholds [[Sheriff Hutton]] and Middleham in Yorkshire and [[Penrith, Cumbria|Penrith]] in Cumberland, which had belonged to Warwick the Kingmaker.{{sfnp|Hicks|2001|p=82}} It is possible that the grant of Middleham seconded Richard's personal wishes.{{refn|Says Kendall, \"Richard had won his way back to Middleham Castle\". However, any personal attachment he may have felt to Middleham was likely mitigated in his adulthood, as surviving records demonstrate he spent less time there than at [[Barnard Castle]] and [[Pontefract Castle|Pontefract]].\" \"No great magnate or royal duke in the fifteenth century had a 'home' in the twentieth-century sense of the word.

Neither the birth dates nor the names of the mothers of either of the children is known. Katherine was old enough to be wedded in 1484, when the age of consent was twelve, and John was knighted in September 1483 in [[York Minster]], and so most historians agree that they were both fathered when Richard was a teenager.{{sfnp|Ashdown-Hill|2013}}{{sfnp|Baldwin|2013|p=42}} There is no evidence of infidelity on Richard's part after his marriage to Anne Neville in 1472 when he was around 20.{{sfnp|Kendall|1956|p=387}} This has led to a suggestion by the historian [[A.

Richard visited Pontefract from 1471, in April and October 1473, and in early March 1474, for a week. On 1 March 1474, he granted Alice Burgh \u00a320 a year for life \"for certain special causes and considerations\".

Even in the North in 1482 a man was prosecuted for offences against the Duke of Gloucester, saying he did 'nothing but grin at' the city of York.

The 18th century [[philosopher]] and [[historian]] [[David Hume]] described him as a man who used dissimulation to conceal \"his fierce and savage nature\" and who had \"abandoned all principles of honour and humanity\".{{sfnp|Hume|1864|pp=345\u2013346}} Hume acknowledged that some historians have argued \"that he was well qualified for government, had he legally obtained it; and that he committed no crimes but such as were necessary to procure him possession of the crown\", but he dismissed this view on the grounds that Richard's exercise of arbitrary power encouraged instability.{{sfnp|Hume|1864|p=365}} The most important late 19th-century biographer of the king was [[James Gairdner]], who also wrote the entry on Richard in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]''.{{sfnp|Gairdner|1896}} Gairdner stated that he had begun to study Richard with a neutral viewpoint, but became convinced that Shakespeare and More were essentially correct in their view of the king, despite some exaggerations.{{sfnp|Gairdner|1898|p=xi}}\n\nRichard was not without his defenders, the first of whom was George Buck, a descendant of one of the king's supporters, who completed  a historical account of Richard's life in 1619. Buck attacked the \"improbable imputations and strange and spiteful scandals\" related by Tudor writers, including Richard's alleged deformities and murders. He located lost archival material, including the ''Titulus Regius'', but also claimed to have seen a letter written by Elizabeth of York, according to which Elizabeth sought to marry the king.<ref>{{cite web |title=Elizabeth of York |url=http://www.r3.org/basics/basic8.html |publisher=Richard III Society, American Branch |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180408084900/http://www.r3.org:80/on-line-library-text-essays/back-to-basics-for-newcomers/elizabeth-of-york/ |archive-date=8 April 2018 |url-status=live |access-date=6 December 2018 }}</ref> Though the book was published in 1646, Elizabeth's supposed letter was never produced. Documents which later emerged from the Portuguese Royal archives show that after Queen Anne's death, Richard's ambassadors were sent on a formal errand to negotiate a double marriage between Richard and the Portuguese King's sister [[Joanna, Princess of Portugal|Joana]],{{sfn|Horrox|2013}} of Lancastrian descent,{{sfn|Williams|1983|p=139}} and between Elizabeth of York and Joana's cousin Duke [[Manuel I of Portugal|Manuel]] (later King of Portugal).{{sfnp|Ashdown-Hill|2013}}\n\nSignificant among Richard's defenders was [[Horace Walpole]]. In ''Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard the Third'' (1768), Walpole disputed all the alleged murders and argued that Richard may have acted in good faith. He also argued that any physical abnormality was probably no more than a minor distortion of the shoulders.{{sfnp|Walpole|1798|loc=''Historic Doubts on the Life and Reign of King Richard the Third'', pp. 103\u2013184}} However, he retracted his views in 1793 after [[the Terror]], stating he now believed that Richard could have committed the crimes he was charged with,{{sfnp|Walpole|1798|loc=''Postscript to my Historic Doubts, written in February 1793'', pp. 220\u2013251}} although Pollard observes that this retraction is frequently overlooked by later admirers of Richard.{{sfnp|Pollard|1991|p=216}} Other defenders of Richard include the noted explorer [[Clements Markham]], whose ''Richard III: His Life and Character'' (1906) replied to the work of Gairdner. He argued that Henry VII killed the princes and that the bulk of evidence against Richard was nothing more than Tudor propaganda.{{sfn|Myers|1968|pp=199\u2013200}} An intermediate view was provided by Alfred Legge in ''The Unpopular King'' (1885). Legge argued that Richard's \"greatness of soul\" was eventually \"warped and dwarfed\" by the ingratitude of others.{{sfnp|Legge|1885|p=viii}}\n\nSome twentieth-century historians have been less inclined to moral judgement,{{sfnp|Myers|1968|pp=200\u2013202}} seeing Richard's actions as a product of the unstable times. In the words of [[Charles Ross (historian)|Charles Ross]], \"the later fifteenth century in England is now seen as a ruthless and violent age as concerns the upper ranks of society, full of private feuds, intimidation, land-hunger, and litigiousness, and consideration of Richard's life and career against this background has tended to remove him from the lonely pinnacle of Villainy Incarnate on which Shakespeare had placed him. Like most men, he was conditioned by the standards of his age.\"{{sfnp|Ross|1981|p=liii}} The [[Richard III Society]], founded in 1924 as \"The Fellowship of the White Boar\", is the oldest of several groups dedicated to improving his reputation.  Other contemporary historians still describe him as, a \"power-hungry and ruthless politician\" who was still most probably \"ultimately responsible for the murder of his nephews.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Hebron |first=Michael |date=15 March 2016 |title=Richard III and the Will to Power |url=https://www.bl.uk/shakespeare/articles/richard-iii-and-the-will-to-power |website=Discovering Literature: Shakespeare & Renaissance |publisher=[[British Library]] |access-date=23 September 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Hogenboom |first=Melissa |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19572103 |title=Richard III: The people who want everyone to like the infamous king |website=[[BBC News Magazine]] |location=London |date=15 September 2012 |access-date=23 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n===In culture===\n{{main|Cultural depictions of Richard III of England}}\n\n[[File:The True Tragedy of Richard the Third.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Cover of the 1594 [[quarto]] of the anonymous play, ''[[The True Tragedy of Richard III]]''.]]\n\nApart from Shakespeare, Richard appears in many other works of literature.

Additionally, there was an object that appeared to be an arrowhead embedded in the spine; and there were [[wikt:perimortem|perimortem]] injuries to the skull. These included a relatively shallow orifice, which is most likely to have been caused by a [[rondel dagger]], and a scooping depression to the skull, inflicted by a bladed weapon, most probably a sword. Additionally, the bottom of the skull presented a gaping hole, where a [[halberd]] had cut away and entered it. \n\nForensic pathologist Dr Stuart Hamilton stated that this injury would have left the individual's brain visible, and most certainly would have been the cause of death. Dr Jo Appleby, the osteo-archaeologist who excavated the skeleton, concurred and described the latter as \"a mortal battlefield wound in the back of the skull\". The base of the skull also presented another fatal wound in which a bladed weapon had been thrust into it, leaving behind a jagged hole.

It is generally accepted that postmortem, Richard's naked body was tied to the back of a horse, with his arms slung over one side and his legs and buttocks over the other. This presented a tempting target for onlookers, and the angle of the blow on the pelvis suggests that one of them stabbed Richard's right buttock with substantial force, as the cut extends from the back all the way to the front of the pelvic bone and was most probably an act of humiliation.

The team concluded that it is unlikely that the king was wearing a helmet in his last moments. Soil taken from the remains was found to contain microscopic [[Ascaris lumbricoides|roundworm]] eggs. Several eggs were found in samples taken from the pelvis, where the king's intestines were, but not from the skull and only very small numbers were identified in soil surrounding the grave. The findings suggest that the higher concentration of eggs in the pelvic area probably arose from a roundworm infection the King suffered in his life, rather than from human waste dumped in the area at a later date, researchers said. The Mayor of Leicester announced that the king's skeleton would be re-interred at [[Leicester Cathedral]] in early 2014, but a judicial review of that decision delayed the reinterment for a year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Warzynski |first=Peter A. |date=23 May 2014 |title=Richard III: Leicester wins the battle of the bones |url=http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Richard-III-Leicester-win-battle-bones/story-21132993-detail/story.html |newspaper=[[Leicester Mercury]] |publisher=Local World |location=<!--Leicester, England (omitted as given by newspaper name)--> |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140524043912/http://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/Richard-III-Leicester-win-battle-bones/story-21132993-detail/story.html |archive-date=24 May 2014 |url-status=dead |access-date=23 May 2014}}</ref> A museum to Richard III was opened in July 2014 in the Victorian school buildings next to the Greyfriars grave site.<ref name=\"BBC DNA\"/><ref name=\"LU-results-announced\">{{cite web|title=Richard III DNA results announced \u2013 Leicester University reveals identity of human remains found in car park|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/LIVE-UPDATES-Richard-III-DNA-results-announced/story-18041484-detail/story.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130421124125/http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/LIVE-UPDATES-Richard-III-DNA-results-announced/story-18041484-detail/story.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 April 2013|work=[[Leicester Mercury]] |location=<!--Leicester, England (omitted as given by newspaper name)--> |accessdate=4 February 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://kriii.com/january-opening/ |title=News: January Opening |publisher=King Richard III Visitor Centre |date=29 December 2014 |accessdate=4 February 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204215709/http://kriii.com/january-opening/ |archive-date=4 February 2015 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe proposal to have King Richard buried in Leicester attracted some controversy.

It was released on April 25, 1995, by [[Loud Records]]. The album features [[guest appearance]]s by [[Nas]], [[Raekwon]], [[Ghostface Killah]], and [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]], who also contributed to its production and mixing. Most of the leftover songs from the album became bonus tracks for Mobb Deep's ''[[The Infamous Mobb Deep]]'' album (2014).\n\nUpon its release, ''The Infamous'' achieved notable commercial success, debuting at number 15 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 3 on the [[Top R&B/Hip Hop Albums]] charts. On June 26, 1995, the album was certified [[Gold album|gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA).<ref name=\"RIAA\">{{cite web |last = |first = |url = https://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp |title = Gold and Platinum Database Search at Riaa.com |format = |work = |publisher = |accessdate = December 31, 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061221102221/http://www.riaa.com/gp/database/default.asp <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 21, 2006}}</ref> The album produced four singles; \"[[Shook Ones (Part II)]]\", \"[[Survival of the Fittest (song)|Survival of the Fittest]]\", \"[[Temperature's Rising (Mobb Deep song)|Temperature's Rising]]\", \"[[Give Up the Goods (Just Step)]]\"; the first three singles achieved varying degrees of chart success, with \"Shook Ones (Part II)\" being the most successful.\n\nThe album's dark, haunting style, defined by its evocative melodies, rugged beats, and lyrics dealing with crime in [[inner city]] neighborhoods, reflected the destitute side of [[New York City|New York]]'s urban landscape in a manner that received special recognition and critical praise. Along with albums such as ''[[Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers)]]'', ''[[Illmatic]]'' and ''[[Ready to Die]]'', ''The Infamous'' is widely credited as a major contributor to the [[East Coast hip hop#Renaissance (1990s)|East Coast Renaissance]]. Furthermore, the album is credited with helping to redefine the sound of [[hardcore hip hop]], using its production style, which incorporated eerie piano [[loop (music)|loops]], distorted synthesizers, [[Eighth note|eighth-note]] [[Hi-hat (instrument)|hi-hats]], and sparse [[low-pass filter|filtered]] basslines.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Q-Tip at Commonwealth Washington, D.C. in 2008.jpg|thumb|left|165px|[[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]] played an important role in the album's production and mixing]]\nDuring the spring of 1993, while the group was still in their late teens, Mobb Deep released their first album ''[[Juvenile Hell]]'' under the [[4th & B'way Records]] label. The album included production from several revered New York-based producers, including [[Large Professor]], [[DJ Premier]], and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] affiliate Kerwin Young, and included the underground hit single \"[[Hit It from the Back]]\". Due to ''Juvenile Hell''{{'s}} failure to achieve significant commercial and critical success, the duo was dropped from their label several months after the album's release.<ref name=\"Coleman267\">Coleman, Brian, 2007. P:267</ref> [[Havoc (musician)|Havoc]] and [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] later described ''Juvenile Hell'' as a \"learning experience\".<ref name=\"Coleman267\"/>\n\nDuring the summer of 1993, [[Loud Records]] was looking for another group to sign, owing to the success of [[Wu-Tang Clan]]'s first single, \"[[Protect Ya Neck]]\", and by fall 1993, the label had signed Mobb Deep.<ref name=\"Coleman267\"/> In 1994, the group released the promotional single \"[[Shook Ones (song)|Shook Ones]]\", which served as a preview of their new sound.<ref name=\"pitchfork\"/><ref name=\"complex\"/> Unlike the duo's first album, ''The Infamous'' was mostly self-produced by Havoc and Prodigy, with outside help from Loud [[artists and repertoire|A&R]] representatives Matt Life and Schott Free, as well as [[A Tribe Called Quest]] producer [[Q-Tip (musician)|Q-Tip]], who discovered Mobb Deep in the early 1990s.<ref name=\"djbooth\">James, Andy.

Accessed on April 6, 2020.</ref> Matt Life later recalled Q-Tip's involvements, stating, \"Tip was very involved in ''The Infamous'' from early on. Probably more than people know. Tip was just a fan of theirs and I knew him from way back, so he was really helpful, giving them advice.\"<ref name=\"Coleman269\">Coleman, Brian, 2007.

MOOVMNT.com. Accessed on April 6, 2020.</ref>\n\nOn the group's decision to handle most of the production, Havoc later commented, \"We started producing because other producers was giving us shit that we didn't like, or they was just charging too much. I didn't know nothing about producing music at the time, but I learned by watching others.\"<ref>Coleman, Brian, 2007. P:266</ref>\n\n==Recording and production==\nRecording sessions for ''The Infamous'' began in 1994 and took place at Battery Studios, Platinum Island Studios, Firehouse Studios and [[Unique Recording Studios|Unique Recording]] in [[New York City]].<ref name=\"pitchfork\"/><ref name=\"Huey\"/> Havoc produced most of the beats in his [[Queensbridge Houses|Queensbridge]] apartment, with Prodigy often assisting him; earlier in their career, Prodigy taught him how to [[sampling (music)|sample]].<ref name=\"complex\">{{cite web|last1=Ahmed|first1=Insanul|last2=Callahan-Bever|first2=Noah|last3=Kondo|first3=Toshitaka|title=The Making of Mobb Deep's 'The Infamous'|url=http://www.complex.com/music/2011/04/the-making-of-mobb-deep-the-infamous|website=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]|accessdate=April 6, 2020}}</ref> Describing their minimal production setup, Prodigy said, \"Our first sampler we had was an [[Ensoniq EPS|EPS 16 plus]] &nbsp;... We had that for a little while, and when the [[Akai MPC|MPC]] came out we bought that, and that was it. A little record player, a little mixer, and that's all we needed.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\nMobb Deep initially recorded 20 songs for ''The Infamous'', but executive producers Matt Life and Schott Free worked with them to improve the music.<ref name=\"complex\"/> Matt Life recalled, \"Schott worked closely with them on how the rhymes were coming and I worked closely with them on how production was coming. The first thing that I remember is them creating a semblance of the core of the first album and me creating a rough in-house version of what the album could be and throwing a sticker on the cassette.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> The early rough version of the album contained five or six songs, including the original versions of the album's four singles. The original \"[[Temperature's Rising (Mobb Deep song)|Temperature's Rising]]\" was remade because of sample clearance issues.<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\nLater on, Q-Tip became the album's mixing engineer; Matt Life explained, \"he came in later in the sessions and said he'd help mix a couple records. And then he ended up picking a couple of records they did to re-do. Except for 'Drink Away the Pain', the songs that Tip produced were already a full song before he got to them. He liked the lyrics on those original songs, but he re-did the beats. It was the same song title, same hook, same rhymes, just new beats.\"<ref name=\"Coleman269\"/> Q-Tip also improved the [[programming (music)|drum programming]] on \"[[Survival of the Fittest (song)|Survival of the Fittest]]\", \"Up North Trip\" and \"Trife Life\".<ref name=\"complex\"/> Describing his contributions as \"a totally different sound than the Tribe stuff\", Q-Tip encouraged Mobb Deep to make their dark sound stand out, by adding [[major chord]]s to their [[minor chord|minor]] [[key (music)|key]] samples.<ref name=\"complex\"/><ref name=\"redbull\">[http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/q-tip Q-Tip] [[Red Bull Music Academy]]. Accessed on April 6, 2020.</ref> Havoc later stated, \"Q-Tip definitely bent his style a little bit to get with what we was doing. Like with 'Drink Away the Pain' you see him trying to get gangsta with it.\"<ref>Coleman, Brian 2007. P:272.</ref> Schott Free summed up Q-Tip's influence:\n\n{{quote|The album was pretty tight, but once Tip comes around he hears different things. He changes [[bass drum|kicks]], [[snare drum|snares]], whatever. Also, you get to watch Havoc implement what he had already known with a cat like Tip and Tip showing him everything he knew. Showing him a format, a formula, and even how to double on the kicks. It's just kinda ill how he just came in and just cleaned it up. His influence is mostly sonically. Playing any of those records in the club, the drums and everything is big. Tip was always a master of making a record sound huge.<ref name=\"complex\"/>}}\n\nLyrically, Mobb Deep added to the album's dark aesthetic.<ref name=\"Huey\"/> Speaking on his verse on \"Survival of the Fittest\", Havoc explained, \"We were just straight hood. It wasn't no pretty boy shit. It was like, 'Yo, let's throw on our [[The Timberland Company|Timbs]].' It didn't get more harder than that.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> On each track, they rapped about the realities of prison, murder, robbery, selling drugs and alcoholism, among other topics.<ref name=\"complex\"/> [[Big Noyd]] had a significant presence on the album, with four guest appearances; discussing the \"Just Step Prelude\", Prodigy recalled, \"That shit right there, that was a rhyme that Noyd used to kick in the projects everyday to niggas &nbsp;... He'd spit that shit that had the whole block going crazy.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> Big Noyd initially preferred to sell drugs and had no desire to be a rapper, until the group convinced him otherwise.<ref name=\"complex\"/> The remaining guest appearances happened in various ways; [[Nas]] was a childhood friend of Havoc, [[Raekwon]] and [[Ghostface Killah]] of Wu-Tang Clan were Mobb Deep's labelmates and [[Crystal Johnson (singer)|Crystal Johnson]] was an associate of Q-Tip.<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\n==Cover artwork==\nThe cover art for ''The Infamous'' was created in Queensbridge Houses, New York by photographer [[Delphine Fawundu|Delphine A. Fawundu]], who later commented about the  photography session in [[Vikki Tobak]]'s 2018 analog hip hop photography collective ''[[Contact High: A Visual History of Hip-Hop]]'' (published by [[Clarkson Potter]]), \"I was inspired by how all these elements came together, making New York hip-hop such a force at that time. It just felt so powerful and it was all happening right before my eyes, and my camera\". In 2019, images from Fawundu's photoshoot with Mobb Deep and the previously unseen contact prints were featured in a full-size museum exhibit at [[The Annenberg Space for Photography]] in Los Angeles.<ref>https://www.contacthighproject.com/blog/delphine-fawundu-on-photographing-the-infamous-mobb-deep</ref><ref>https://allhiphop.com/features/book-review-contact-high-a-visual-history-of-hip-hop-aVwNiEUMrEKfgV1hIMccug/</ref>\n\n== Reception ==\n===Commercial performance===\nThe album spent 18 weeks on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], peaking at number 15, and it also spent 34 weeks on the [[Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums]] charts, peaking at number 3.

Gangs are bound together by a code of fierce loyalty, relying wholly on one another for survival in a hopeless environment.

We had that for a little while, and when the [[Akai MPC|MPC]] came out we bought that, and that was it. A little record player, a little mixer, and that's all we needed.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\nMobb Deep initially recorded 20 songs for ''The Infamous'', but executive producers Matt Life and Schott Free worked with them to improve the music.<ref name=\"complex\"/> Matt Life recalled, \"Schott worked closely with them on how the rhymes were coming and I worked closely with them on how production was coming. The first thing that I remember is them creating a semblance of the core of the first album and me creating a rough in-house version of what the album could be and throwing a sticker on the cassette.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> The early rough version of the album contained five or six songs, including the original versions of the album's four singles. The original \"[[Temperature's Rising (Mobb Deep song)|Temperature's Rising]]\" was remade because of sample clearance issues.<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\nLater on, Q-Tip became the album's mixing engineer; Matt Life explained, \"he came in later in the sessions and said he'd help mix a couple records. And then he ended up picking a couple of records they did to re-do. Except for 'Drink Away the Pain', the songs that Tip produced were already a full song before he got to them. He liked the lyrics on those original songs, but he re-did the beats. It was the same song title, same hook, same rhymes, just new beats.\"<ref name=\"Coleman269\"/> Q-Tip also improved the [[programming (music)|drum programming]] on \"Survival of the Fittest\", \"Up North Trip\" and \"Trife Life\".<ref name=\"complex\"/> Describing his contributions as \"a totally different sound than the Tribe stuff\", Q-Tip encouraged Mobb Deep to make their dark sound stand out, by adding [[major chord]]s to their [[minor chord|minor]] [[key (music)|key]] samples.<ref name=\"complex\"/><ref name=\"redbull\">[http://www.redbullmusicacademy.com/lectures/q-tip Q-Tip] [[Red Bull Music Academy]].

Like with 'Drink Away the Pain' you see him trying to get gangsta with it.\"<ref>Coleman, Brian 2007. P:272.</ref> Schott Free summed up Q-Tip's influence:\n\n{{quote|The album was pretty tight, but once Tip comes around he hears different things. He changes [[bass drum|kicks]], [[snare drum|snares]], whatever. Also, you get to watch Havoc implement what he had already known with a cat like Tip and Tip showing him everything he knew. Showing him a format, a formula, and even how to double on the kicks. It's just kinda ill how he just came in and just cleaned it up. His influence is mostly sonically. Playing any of those records in the club, the drums and everything is big. Tip was always a master of making a record sound huge.<ref name=\"complex\"/>}}\n\nLyrically, Mobb Deep added to the album's dark aesthetic.<ref name=\"Huey\"/> Speaking on his verse on \"Survival of the Fittest\", Havoc explained, \"We were just straight hood. It wasn't no pretty boy shit. It was like, 'Yo, let's throw on our [[The Timberland Company|Timbs]].' It didn't get more harder than that.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> On each track, they rapped about the realities of prison, murder, robbery, selling drugs and alcoholism, among other topics.<ref name=\"complex\"/> [[Big Noyd]] had a significant presence on the album, with four guest appearances; discussing the \"Just Step Prelude\", Prodigy recalled, \"That shit right there, that was a rhyme that Noyd used to kick in the projects everyday to niggas &nbsp;... He'd spit that shit that had the whole block going crazy.\"<ref name=\"complex\"/> Big Noyd initially preferred to sell drugs and had no desire to be a rapper, until the group convinced him otherwise.<ref name=\"complex\"/> The remaining guest appearances happened in various ways; [[Nas]] was a childhood friend of Havoc, [[Raekwon]] and [[Ghostface Killah]] of Wu-Tang Clan were Mobb Deep's labelmates and [[Crystal Johnson (singer)|Crystal Johnson]] was an associate of Q-Tip.<ref name=\"complex\"/>\n\n==Cover artwork==\nThe cover art for ''The Infamous'' was created in Queensbridge Houses, New York by photographer [[Delphine Fawundu|Delphine A.

Similarly, there's little pleasure or relief offered in the picture of the streets Mobb Deep paints here: They inhabit a war zone where crime and paranoia hang constantly in the air.
