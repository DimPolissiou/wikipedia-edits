This service operated until 30 September 1964, the day before the Tokaido Shinkansen opened.<ref name=meikan1995>\"\u5217\u8eca\u540d\u94511995\" (Train Name Directory 1995), published August 1995 by Railway Journal</ref>\n\nWhen the Tokaido Shinkansen opened on 1 October 1964, the ''Hikari'' was the fastest train on the line, initially travelling from [[Tokyo Station]] to [[Shin-Osaka Station]] with only two stops ([[Nagoya Station|Nagoya]] and [[Kyoto Station|Kyoto]]). ''Hikari'' service was extended to the Sanyo Shinkansen later, although the ''Hikari'' trains were only slightly faster than the ''Kodama'' trains, earning them the derisive nickname \"Hidama.\"\n\nIn March 2008, the new [[N700 Series Shinkansen]] was put into service on a morning ''Hikari'' service between [[Shin-Yokohama Station|Shin-Yokohama]] and [[Hiroshima Station|Hiroshima]] stations, and a late night run between Tokyo and Nagoya.

This service operated until 30 September 1964, the day before the Tokaido Shinkansen opened.<ref name=meikan1995>\"\u5217\u8eca\u540d\u94511995\" (Train Name Directory 1995), published August 1995 by Railway Journal</ref>\n\nWhen the Tokaido Shinkansen opened on 1 October 1964, the ''Hikari'' was the fastest train on the line, initially travelling from [[Tokyo Station]] to [[Shin-Osaka Station]] with only two stops ([[Nagoya Station|Nagoya]] and [[Kyoto Station|Kyoto]]). ''Hikari'' service was extended to the Sanyo Shinkansen later, although the ''Hikari'' trains were only slightly faster than the ''Kodama'' trains, earning them the derisive nickname \"Hidama.\"\n\nIn March 2008, the new [[N700 Series Shinkansen]] was put into service on a morning ''Hikari'' service between [[Shin-Yokohama Station|Shin-Yokohama]] and [[Hiroshima Station|Hiroshima]] stations, and a late night run between Tokyo and Nagoya. A third N700 ''Hikari'' run between Nagoya and Tokyo was added in October 2008,<ref>{{cite press release|title=\u79cb\u306e\u81e8\u6642\u5217\u8eca\u306e\u304a\u77e5\u3089\u305b |publisher=JR Central |date=2008-08-22 |url=http://jr-central.co.jp/news/release/nws000167.html |accessdate=2008-08-25 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824215310/http://jr-central.co.jp/news/release/nws000167.html |archivedate=24 August 2008 }}</ref> and a few other N700 ''Hikari'' runs have since been added.\n\nFrom the start of the revised timetable on 17 March 2012, ''Hikari Rail Star'' services using [[700 Series Shinkansen|700 series]] 8-car E sets became entirely no-smoking.<ref name=\"jrwest20111216\">{{cite web|url=http://www.westjr.co.jp/press/article/items/20111216_honsya.pdf |script-title=ja:\u5e73\u621024\u6625\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u6539\u6b63\u306b\u3064\u3044\u3066 |trans-title=March 2012 Timetable Revision Details |date=16 December 2011 |work=News Release |publisher=West Japan Railway Company |location=Japan |language=Japanese |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111216172516/http://www.westjr.co.jp/press/article/items/20111216_honsya.pdf |archivedate=16 December 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAs of 2012, [[JR Central]] ''Hikari'' services operating throughout the Tokaido/Sanyo corridor primarily use 16-car [[N700 series]] and [[700 Series Shinkansen|700 series]] trains.
