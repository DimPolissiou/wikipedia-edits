Traditionally a paper-reading society, meetings sometimes continue the format of responses to a paper rather than debate on a motion.\n\nIts rooms are within the [[Graduates' Memorial Building]] (GMB) of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]], which it has shared with the [[College Historical Society]] (''the Hist'') since the building's construction in 1902, where it provides facilities for its members such as a games and a [[Graduates Memorial Building#interior|conversation room]]. The Phil shares the use of its [[Graduates Memorial Building#Second Floor|Bram Stoker Room]] with the [[College Theological Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|College Theological Society]] (''the Theo''). It holds most of its meetings in the GMB's [[Graduates Memorial Building#Interior|Debating Chamber]] with meetings having an expected audience of above two hundred being held in the larger lecture theatres of the college.\n\nThe society also hosts numerous social events, internal competitions, sporting events, blood drives and the occasional concert. It endeavours each year in providing debating workshops, developmental competitions for members and school children. Furthermore, it has a strong history in intervarsity debating competitions, at both an international and national level.\n\nThe society publishes The Philander as an annual Freshers' guide to the society.\n\n===Membership===\nMembership of the society is open to all [[Undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate]] students, as well as all staff members of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]]. It offers four year membership to students of the university. This means that should a person join in their [[Student#Ireland|Junior Freshman]] year they would still be a member for their entire time of study at the college.\n\n==History==\n[[File:William Molyneux (1656-1698).jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[William Molyneux]], founding member]]\nThe history of the University Philosophical Society spans over three centuries, several guises, identities and name changes.<ref name=\"Keenan & O'Hare\" />\n\n===Foundation in the 17th century===\nIn 1683, natural philosopher and political writer [[William Molyneux]] (b. 1656) founded the [[Dublin Philosophical Society]], with the assistance of his brother [[Sir Thomas Molyneux, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Molyneux]] and future Provost [[St George Ashe]]. They intended it to be the equivalent of the [[Royal Society]] in London (with which it maintained cultural ties) as well as the Philosophical Society at the [[University of Oxford]]. The society was traditionally a paper reading society; however it also included many demonstrations of the latest science and mathematical endeavour of that era. The first meeting on 15 October 1683<ref name=\"Wilde\">{{citation |title=Memoir of the Dublin Philosophical Society of 1683 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy |volume=3 |last=Wilde |first=W.R. |authorlink=William Wilde |page=162 |jstor=20489545 |year=1844}}</ref> was in the Provost's lodgings at [[Trinity College Dublin]], a location where members continued to meet.\n\nSometime after December 1683, Provost [[Robert Huntington]] became the society's first Senior Patron, promising protection and assistance, a role the Provost of Trinity College still holds. While at the time no particular precedent existed for Trinity College to recognise it, it can be considered {{by whom|date=September 2016}} the college's first such society.\n\nOn 1 November 1684 [[William Petty]] was elected as the first President of the society, and [[William Molyneux]] elected as its first Secretary. The current numbering takes this as the first session of the University Philosophical Society.\n\n===Reformation in the 19th century===\n[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait.jpg|thumb|left|130px| [[Oscar Wilde]], member of the society in the 19th century]]\nIn November 1842,<ref name=Thom>{{cite book|title=Thom's Directory of Ireland|year=1850|publisher=Alexander Thom|location=Dublin|page=281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6V4NAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA281}}</ref> to mark the original session date the '''Dublin Philosophical Society''' was fully reformed under its original name, traditionally meeting on Mondays, to cater for those Trinity College students too young to join other societies in Dublin. The first meeting took place in [[Marlborough Street, Dublin|Marlborough Street]].<ref name=\"Book Of TCD\">{{Cite book |last=various |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61000/61000-h/61000-h.htm |title=The Book of Trinity College, Dublin, 1591-1891 |publisher=[[Marcus Ward & Co.]] |year=1892 |via=[[Project Gutenberg]] |section=THE COLLEGE SOCIETIES}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, undergraduates were not allowed to join most College societies, such as the [[College Historical Society]]. It then became the '''Dublin University Philosophical Society''' in February 1843<ref name=\"Keenan & O'Hare\" /><ref name=Thom />  when it was recognized by the college, with then [[Provost (education)|Provost]] [[Franc Sadleir]] reassuming the traditional role of Senior Patron.\n\nDuring this time the society had its rooms in No.4 (now House 4) in [[Trinity College, Dublin#Buildings and Grounds|Parliament Square]]<ref name=Bailey>{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Kenneth Claude|title=A History of Trinity College, Dublin, 1892-1945|journal=Hermathena|date=May 1948|volume=71|page=155}}</ref>  with larger meetings taking place within the [[Trinity College, Dublin#Buildings and Grounds|Examination Hall]].\n\nIn 1860, the Dublin University Philosophical Society changed its name to the '''University Philosophical Society'''. This makes the Phil the oldest, student, paper-reading, and collegial society in the world,<ref name=\"Keenan & O'Hare\" /> as well as currently being the largest such society in Ireland.\n\n===20th Century===\nThe society suffered greatly, with the rest of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. [[Ireland]] was still part of the [[British Empire]] during the outbreak of the war and so many [[Irish people|Irish]] enlisted. However, there was a diverse mixture between members who predominantly described as being part of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and those who believed more in [[Irish republicanism]].\n[[File:1937 Reading Room (Trinity College, Dublin).jpg|thumb|right|150px|The 1937 Reading Room, [[World War I memorials|Memorial]] to members of the [[Trinity College, Dublin|college]] who died during the [[World War I|First World War]]]]\n\nThe meetings and overall strength of the society was massively diminished during the period, with there being no Inaugural Meeting from 1913 until 1919 after the end of the war.\n\nFrom 1913 (229th Session) to 1916 (231st Session) ten officers of the society resigned their positions to enlist. [[Minutes]] from the time mention that many more members of the society would go on to enlist, however their names went unrecorded.\n\nIn 1919 the names of eight past officers and members of council of the society who had been killed during the war was read aloud at the Opening Meeting.\n\n* James Austin, President 1913-1914 (229th Session).\n* AEL West, President 1915-1916 (231st Session).\n* Reverend Everard Digges La Touche, Seceratary 1907-1908 (223rd Session).\n* JHF Leland, Treasurer 1909-1910 (225th Session).\n* Walter Osborne Varian, Treasurer 1915-1916 (231st Session).\n* JS West, Registrar 1914-1915 (230th Session).\n* Francis George McGibney, Member of Council 1912-1913 (228th Session).\n* William Kee, Member of Council 1914-1915 (230th Session).\n\n{{Quotation|''Of them and those other members who gave up their lives, we can only say that while the University Philosophical Society stands they shall not be forgotten, since such men, by their deaths, have conferred on their Society, and on all connected with them, an honour that does not fade.''|Society Records| extract from the first Opening meeting of the Society in 1919. }}\n\nThe [[Irish War of Independence]] began shortly after the beginning of 1919, public and political will to remember those lost during the war was weak. This meant that the names of many more members of the society who were also killed during the [[World War I|First World War]] went unrecorded by the society.\n\nThe [[World War II|Second World War]], had a lesser effect on the society, though one notable President of the early 1940s was lawyer, Nigerian independence activist and Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Udo Udoma]].\n\n===Dublin University Elizabethan Society (\"The Eliz\")===\n[[File:DU Elizabethan Society Crest.png|thumb|right|180px| Crest of the Dublin University Elizabethan Society]]\nThe first female students were admitted to the [[Trinity College Dublin|college]] in 1904, however they were unable to join any of the student societies that existed at the time. In response to this the '''Dublin University Elizabethan Society''' (more commonly known as ''The Eliz'') was founded in 1905 by the first woman student of the university [[Isabel Marion Weir Johnston]].<ref name=\"Trinity News Nov. 1964\">{{cite news|title=Eliz. Jubilee|newspaper=Trinity News.|date=26 November 1964}}</ref>  The society was a female-only debating society, having sent teams to the [[Irish Times Debate|Irish Times National Debating Championship]] from relatively early in the competitions history. It also hosted many debates, paper discussions, group discussions and the Eliz Garden Party (within [[Trinity College Dublin#Buildings and grounds|Fellow's Square]]) which was considered one of the social highlights of [[Trinity term]] in the college. Each year the society welcomed esteemed guests to speak on topics regarding the history, the societal limitations of women and feminism. These included such guests as [[Ninette de Valois]], dancer and founder of [[The Royal Ballet]], who visited in late 1964 to celebrate the society's 60th year.<ref name=\"Trinity News Feb. 1964\">{{cite news|title=Men - no instinctive profession- de Valois|newspaper=Trinity News.|date=20 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nThe society had its rooms in No.6 (now House 6) in [[Trinity College Dublin#Buildings and grounds|Parliament Square]], housing many amenities for female students within the college, including one of only a handful of female [[Toilet (room)|toilets]] on the campus.\n\nAs mentioned in the following section, over the years there had been great debate within both the University Philosophical Society and the Dublin University Elizabethan Society regarding a merger of both societies into one. There was strong individual opposition within both societies however, with a vote in 1968<ref name=\"Trinity News Feb. 1968\">{{cite news|newspaper=Trinity News.|date=1 February 1968}}</ref>  by the Eliz rejecting a merger. However, in 1981 the Dublin University Elizabethan Society merged with the University Philosophical Society, which vastly increased female membership and increased debating within the society.\n\nToday as a symbolic gesture, the highest ranking female officer of the Phil is accorded the honorary title of '''President of the Elizabethan Society'''.\n\n====Inclusion of Women====\nIt was the 1953/54 session of the Phil that first welcomed in long overdue gender equality advances: Women were at last allowed to attend public business meetings and then also to speak at them (provided though Standing Orders were suspended!). What is more, at the end of that session, membership was actually even opened up to them. Sadly though, this final breakthrough proved short-lived as the College Board after a gap of only one term \u2013 and although it had no direct constitutional jurisdiction here \u2013 in early 1955 voted down female membership for that year pending possible reorganisation of the Major Societies.<ref name=\"Trinity News Feb. 1955\">{{cite news|date=3 February 1955|newspaper=Trinity News.}}</ref> It was an understandable decision perhaps from the Board's point of view except that even more sadly such restructuring was never led by them as announced or indeed subsequently. While reorganisations and possible mergers between the Phil and the Hist and the Phil and the Eliz and the Phil and the SRC (Student Representative Council) + the Eliz surfaced variously at periodic intervals actual plans \u2018with legs\u2019 never seemed to result. Divisions and maybe feelings of self-interest within and between the different factions, the continuing unwillingness/inability of the College for some reason to meaningfully grapple with this process and, what is more, effectively address the issue of student union type facilities that were commonplace in other institutions of higher education all seemingly presented insurmountable hurdles.\n\nIndeed, it wasn't until session 1963/64 that a further vote taken by the Phil on the admission of women, although it was lost by only 3 votes. Some advances were though made: From that session onwards, it was agreed that women could at last reply to papers read to the Society and, in 1965, Joanna Walmsley became the first woman to read her paper to the society. (It wasentitled \"Tolstoy - Realist or Moralist?\").<ref name=\"Trinity News Feb. 1965\">{{cite news|title=Jo Walmsley at the Phil|date=18 February 1965|newspaper=Trinity News.}}</ref> One of concerns held over the years had been that the Society's facilities were generally inadequate for a larger mixed membership. In session 1967/1968.<ref name=\"Trinity News April 1967\">{{cite news|title=Phiz Explodes in Bitterness|date=13 April 1967|newspaper=Trinity News.}}</ref> opposition even led then President of the Phil (Gordon Ledbetter) to resign in exasperation.<ref name=\"Trinity News April 1967\" /> It was a matter though that wasn't going to go away. At the first Council meeting and a subsequent private business in the following session (1967\u201368), this aspect again prominently featured as a concern. There were also many in the Phil who felt the way forward would be achieved through revisiting the idea of a merger with the Eliz to form a super sized Major Society.  However, even setting to one side the thorny issue of finding satisfactory accommodation for such a body, it also turned out to be the case this time - as it had previously that the Eliz just weren't sufficiently interested such a proposal. (That was of course to change some years later).\n\nWith such topics under the spotlight, a feeling though also started to emerge from the active membership that discussion was going around in circles once again. The halfway house with regards to female participation was just unsatisfactory.  For quite sincerely held reasons of equal rights and inclusivity and indeed on a practical level to revitalise our business and expand membership the Society had to try and go it alone regardless.  So a motion calling for women to quite simply be admitted as full members was proposed, debated at Private Business on 30th. November 1967...and was elatedly passed! <ref name=\"Trinity News Jan. 1968\">{{cite news|date=18 January 1968|newspaper=Trinity News}}</ref> The then President of the Phil (Geoff Goolnik) pointed out to those gathered that restrictions on female membership had in fact been a matter of convention as gender was never once mentioned in the then current Laws \u2013 unlike with those of the two other Major Societies, viz.the Eliz and the Hist (College Historical Society).\n\n At the following private business meeting held on 5th. December three women were proposed and voted in as members \u2013 including the then President of the Eliz (Elizabeth Hall) who was appropriately nominated by Goolnik and seconded by \u2018Gully\u2019 Stanford, the then Auditor of the Hist, in his capacity as an ordinary member of the Phil!  Finally, the first female member to address the Society after it had become gender free, Gr\u00e1inne Monks, was also elected on 1st. February 1968 as the first female member of Council.\n\nIn Trinity News\u2019 edition of 25th. November 1953,  an anonymous female contributor had declared that \"The bar to the admission of women to [the other] major societies ...is a real deprivation to everyone \u2013 to College women, to the members of the societies, themselves and, most important, to the University\".<ref name=\"Trinity News Nov. 1968\">{{cite news|title=*A Woman's Point of View|url=http://www.trinitynewsarchive.ie/25pdf/01-05.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2015|newspaper=Trinity News|date=25 November 1953|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519173408/http://http/|archivedate=19 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Fifteen years and five days later the Phil at least eventually, permanently and proudly righted that wrong.\n\n===21st Century===\nToday the University Philosophical Society is the largest student society within the college and Ireland.

Additionally it invites many internationally esteemed guests each year, regularly interviews with public figures, which have included [[Al Pacino]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Angela Merkel]] and [[Stephen Fry]].\n\n===Notable events===\nAmong the notable events held was the demonstration of an early [[telephone]] by Stephen Yeates in 1865.\n\n==Governance==\nThe Phil is governed by a Council elected by the members of the society each year. There are eight officers: President, Secretary, Treasurer, Registrar, Debates Convenor, Librarian, Steward, and Schools Convenor. All officers are directly elected. In addition to the officers are a fourteen Members of Council. The Members of Council serve as deputies to the officers, aid in the execution of their responsibilities and any other such work necessary for the efficient running of the society. Six are directly elected each year. One of these six is then selected by the Council to serve as Vice President of the society. The Senior Member of Council is also elected in the same manner as the officers of the society and is delegated the responsibility of co-ordinating the other Members of Council. The newly elected Council may then add up to seven further Members of Council via [[co-option]].\n\n[[File:Trinity College Dublin 4.jpg|thumb|right|The Graduates Memorial Building (G.M.B.) home to the University Philosophical Society since the beginning of the 20th century.]]\n\n==The Bram Stoker Club==\n[[File:Bram Stoker.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Bram Stoker]], former President of the Society, who presented \"Sensationalism in Fiction and Society\" as his first paper]]\nIn addition to its usual events, the society added a sub-group, the '''Bram Stoker Club''' (more commonly known as '''Bram'''), to its organization in 2011. Named after one of the Phil's most illustrious presidents ([[Bram Stoker]]), the club holds weekly afternoon paper-readings on a range of topics. These paper-readings have served to carry on the long tradition of the society, which had fallen slightly out of fashion in recent years.\n\nIn January 2013, the Club was incorporated into the official [[law]]s of the University Philosophical Society by majority vote. This was then officially recognised by the Dublin University Central Societies Committee in March of the same year.\n\nIt had its first foray outside of College in 2013, entering the winning team of John Engle and Liam Brophy in that years [[Irish Times Debate|Irish Times National Debating Championship]].<ref name=\"Irish Times\">{{cite news|last=Moriarty|first=Gerry|title=TCD Bram Stoker Club wins 'Irish Times' Debate in Queen's|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/tcd-bram-stoker-club-wins-irish-times-debate-in-queen-s-1.1314086|accessdate=22 May 2013|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=23 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 4th Session, the club welcomed three living descendants of its namesake Bram Stoker. Noel Dobbs, Robin MacCaw and [[Dacre Stoker]] met with members of the club and society at large. Each presented papers on the history of Bram Stoker and legacy of [[Dracula]] within their family. Also in attendance was distant relative and [[Seanad \u00c9ireann|Senator]] [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]]. Finally the Stoker family presented the club with portrait of Bram Stoker by Dublin artist Damian Byrne, and a plaque specifying the connection between the society and their ancestor.\n\n==Competitive debating==\nThe society endeavors each year to enable its membership to engage in competitive debating both externally and internally to the college. This includes holding workshops, regular weekly competitive debates, as well as traveling to other colleges throughout Ireland and abroad to compete in similar competitions.\n\n===External Debating Competitions===\nThe society has a strong presence and list of accomplishment on the competitive debating circuit. Having first won the [[Irish Times Debate|Irish Times National Debating Championship]] in 1961 the society has gone on to win and place in several other well known debating competitions. These include the [[John Smith Memorial Mace]], [[World Universities Debating Championship]], [[NUIG Literary and Debating Society#Activities|Irish National Law Debates]], [[UCC Philosophical Society#Competitive events|Cork IV]] and the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)#UCD Vice Presidents' Cup IV|UCD Vice Presidents' Cup IV]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n<!-- Before adding a list of achievements, consider that these should be referenced -->\n\n===Internal Debating Competitions===\nThe society runs several internal debating competitions each year.\nThese consist of:\n*The Eamon O'Coine Memorial Maiden Speaker's Competition (or \"Maidens\"); for first-time speakers in college.\n*The Jeremy Clarkson Memorial Debating Competition (or \"Clarkies\"), consisting of a series of regular weekly debates.; satirically named after TV presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]]. Formerly known as The Maggies, after former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] \n*The Elizabethan Society Memorial Pro-Am Competition (or \"Lizzies\"); a competition whereby experienced debaters (Pros) are teamed with less experienced speakers (Ams). \n* The Isabel Marion Weir Johnston Memorial (or \"Izzy's\"); is an internal competition for all members of the society. It is named in honour of the first woman to enter Trinity where she went on to found the Elizabethan Society which later merged with the Philosophical Society.\n*The J.P Mahaffy Memorial (or \"Mahaffy's\"); named after former President of the society [[John Pentland Mahaffy]] internal debating competition for [[Student#Ireland|Junior Freshman]] (\"fresher\") teams of two.\n\n===Trinity Inter-varsity===\nEach year, normally in January, the society jointly with the [[College Historical Society|Hist]] hosts the [[Trinity IV|Claire Stewart Trinity IV]]. Before 2015 this consisted of the Trinity Invitational and the [[Jonathan Swift|Dean Swift]] Intervarsity. In 2015, the Trinity Invitational was replaced with Trinity Women's Debating Competition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tcdphil.com/?page_id=2254 |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002075529/http://tcdphil.com/?page_id=2254 |archive-date=2 October 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Phil Speaks==\n[[File:Phil Speaks Logo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Phil Speaks Logo]]\n'''The Phil Speaks Debating and Public Speaking Initiative''', more commonly known as '''Phil Speaks''' is a campaign aimed at promoting, as well as developing skills in public speaking and oratory. Formed by the society in 2004 the initiative combines in-school oratory workshops, with Pro\u2013Am (Professional-Amateur) learning competitions to encourage these skills in students of all secondary [[school]]s throughout [[Ireland]].\n\nAt the end of the contest, the society hosts the Phil Speaks Competitive Weekend modelled on the format of a University Intervarsity Competition held within the [[Graduates Memorial Building]], with the grand final taking place in the [[Graduates Memorial Building#Interior|Debating Chamber]].\n\n==Awards==\nAnnually, the society internally awards the author of the best paper and the best [[Graduates Memorial Building#Interior|chamber]] speaker from its membership, medals of [[Public speaking|oratory]] and [[Composition (language)|composition]].\n\nThe society also awards the Gold Medal of Honorary Patronage and the Bram Stoker Medal to various esteemed guests each year.\n\n===Central Societies Committee of Trinity College Dublin===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe society has a strong record{{fact|date=February 2020}} of being the recipient of several awards by the internal Central Societies Committee of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} In recent years these include:{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Award\n|-\n|2019\n|''Best Event'', for 'This House Believes that Society is Failing People with Disabilities'.\n|-\n|2018\n|' 'Best Poster' ', 'Club Philth'\n|-\n|2015\n|''Best Large Society''.\n|-\n|2013 \n|''Individual of the Year'', awarded to President Lorcan Clarke (328th Session).\n|-\n|2013\n|''Best Online Web Presence''.\n|-\n|2012 \n|''Best Large Society''.\n|-\n|2011 \n|''Individual of the Year'', awarded to President Declan Meehan (326th Session).\n|-\n|2010 \n|''Best Event'', for the Oscar Wilde Festival (jointly awarded to [[List of Trinity College, Dublin student organisations#Dublin University Players|DU Players]]).\n|-\n|}\n\n===Board of Irish College Societies===\nThe Board of Irish College Societies (BICS) is a national organisation, constituted in 1995, dedicated to providing a national forum for the societies in Ireland's Universities, Colleges and Institutes of Education. The Board is responsible for the promotion of interest in the activities of Irish college societies and of contact and co-operation between them.\n\nThe University Philosophical Society has formidable history of achievement:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Award\n|-\n|2013\n|''Best individual (Large Society)'', awarded to 328th Session President Lorcan Clarke.\n|-\n|2009\n|''Best Event (Large Society)'', awarded for The Trials of Oscar Wilde.\n|-\n|}\n\n==Honorary patrons==\nThrough its years in college, the Society has recorded the presence of many notable guests, the most distinguished of whom are named honorary patrons of the society. Included amongst these are multiple [[Nobel Prize]] laureates, both before and after their receipt of the Prize, such as [[W. B. Yeats]], Heads of State and of Government, notable actors and musicians, as well as well-known intellectuals. Guests have also included all [[Taoiseach|Taoisigh]] since [[Charles Haughey]].\n\n[[File:John Mearsheimer.jpg|thumb|right|120px| [[John Mearsheimer]], awarded the Honorary Patronage in 2012.]]\n\n==Controversies==\nMany guests which the Phil has invited over the years have courted controversy. Contributors to its debates included [[Oswald Mosley]] during his residence in Ireland. In 1988, the Society invited then\u2013[[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] [[David Irving]] to speak. A large protest by students, staff, Jewish groups, socialists, and anti-Nazi activists resulted in the meeting being relocated to a hotel conference room and held in the small hours of the morning. The traditional vote of thanks to Mr Irving for his paper was defeated, which is rare in the society's history.\n[[File:David irving.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Irving was a highly controversial guest speaker who caused protests during his visit.]]\n\nThe address of [[Austria]]n politician [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] to the society in late 2002 led to a protest by self-described anti-fascist activists, which continued through the debate, with noise being made outside the chamber and interjections in the society's proceedings within. An invitation to [[British National Party]] (BNP) official Tony Wentworth was revoked after threats of physical action by leftist groups.\n\nAnother guest to generate controversy was [[Islamist]] [[Anjem Choudary]], who hailed the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] terrorists as martyrs. Former Taoiseach [[John Bruton]] threatened to withdraw from a Phil debate later that year over this invitation, which was not withdrawn. Mr Bruton later became an Honorary Patron of the Society, and Anjem Choudary has been invited to speak at the Phil's lectern several times.\n\nIn 2011, the Phil encountered controversy when it invited [[British National Party|BNP]] leader [[Nick Griffin]] to speak at a Thursday night debate on immigration. After raging protests, talks with college officials and physical threats made to the members and council the invitation was reluctantly withdrawn by the President of the 327th session, Eoin O'Liathain. In a press statement the Phil said that \"it is unfortunate that circumstances have arisen under which the planned debate can no longer go ahead without compromising the safety of staff and students\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=5211|title=Phil statement on the withdrawal of the invitation to BNP leader Nick Griffin|website=www.universitytimes.ie}}</ref> Despite these challenges the session would go on to be voted Best Society in Trinity College that year.\n\nIn 2015, members of the Phil were asked by the President to collect copies of ''[[The University Times]]'' after the newspaper printed details of confidential correspondence that had been supplied to the newspaper in the understanding that it would not be referred to in an article. While ''The University Times'' subsequently agreed to withdraw the edition of the paper in question from circulation, ''[[Trinity News]]'' reported that members of council had discussed calling a motion to impeach the president as a result of the society's actions in collecting the newspapers.<ref>http://trinitynews.ie/ut-withdrawn-phil-removes-papers/</ref> A motion of confidence in the president was later passed at a general meeting of the society.<ref>http://trinitynews.ie/editorial-stand-by-peers/</ref> The incident was cited as one of the factors leading to Samuel Riggs, then the editor of ''The University Times'', agreeing to take a permanent leave of absence from his position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/2015/03/samuel-riggs-to-take-leave-of-absence-from-position-as-editor/|title=Samuel Riggs to Take Leave of Absence from Position as Editor|website=www.universitytimes.ie}}</ref>\n\n==Notable members==\n[[File:Samuel Beckett, 1977.jpeg|thumb|150px| [[Samuel Beckett]], former member of the society]]\n\n===Academia===\n* [[Robert Stawell Ball]], [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|ex-Sch.]], Royal Astronomer of Ireland and [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].

Traditionally a paper-reading society, meetings sometimes continue the format of responses to a paper rather than debate on a motion.\n\nIts rooms are within the [[Graduates' Memorial Building]] (GMB) of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]], which it has shared with the [[College Historical Society]] (''the Hist'') since the building's construction in 1902, where it provides facilities for its members such as a games and a [[Graduates Memorial Building#interior|conversation room]]. The Phil shares the use of its [[Graduates Memorial Building#Second Floor|Bram Stoker Room]] with the [[College Theological Society (Trinity College, Dublin)|College Theological Society]] (''the Theo''). It holds most of its meetings in the GMB's [[Graduates Memorial Building#Interior|Debating Chamber]] with meetings having an expected audience of above two hundred being held in the larger lecture theatres of the college.\n\nThe society also hosts numerous social events, internal competitions, sporting events, blood drives and the occasional concert. It endeavours each year in providing debating workshops, developmental competitions for members and school children. Furthermore, it has a strong history in intervarsity debating competitions, at both an international and national level.\n\nThe society publishes The Philander as an annual Freshers' guide to the society.\n\n===Membership===\nMembership of the society is open to all [[Undergraduate]] and [[Postgraduate]] students, as well as all staff members of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]]. It offers four year membership to students of the university. This means that should a person join in their [[Student#Ireland|Junior Freshman]] year they would still be a member for their entire time of study at the college.\n\n==History==\n[[File:William Molyneux (1656-1698).jpg|thumb|right|130px|[[William Molyneux]], founding member]]\nThe history of the University Philosophical Society spans over three centuries, several guises, identities and name changes.<ref name=\"Keenan & O'Hare\" />\n\n===Foundation in the 17th century===\nIn 1683, natural philosopher and political writer [[William Molyneux]] (b. 1656) founded the [[Dublin Philosophical Society]], with the assistance of his brother [[Sir Thomas Molyneux, 1st Baronet|Sir Thomas Molyneux]] and future Provost [[St George Ashe]]. They intended it to be the equivalent of the [[Royal Society]] in London (with which it maintained cultural ties) as well as the Philosophical Society at the [[University of Oxford]]. The society was traditionally a paper reading society; however it also included many demonstrations of the latest science and mathematical endeavour of that era. The first meeting on 15 October 1683<ref name=\"Wilde\">{{citation |title=Memoir of the Dublin Philosophical Society of 1683 |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy |volume=3 |last=Wilde |first=W.R. |authorlink=William Wilde |page=162 |jstor=20489545 |year=1844}}</ref> was in the Provost's lodgings at [[Trinity College Dublin]], a location where members continued to meet.\n\nSometime after December 1683, Provost [[Robert Huntington]] became the society's first Senior Patron, promising protection and assistance, a role the Provost of Trinity College still holds. While at the time no particular precedent existed for Trinity College to recognise it, it can be considered {{by whom|date=September 2016}} the college's first such society.\n\nOn 1 November 1684 [[William Petty]] was elected as the first President of the society, and [[William Molyneux]] elected as its first Secretary. The current numbering takes this as the first session of the University Philosophical Society.\n\n===Reformation in the 19th century===\n[[File:Oscar Wilde portrait.jpg|thumb|left|130px| [[Oscar Wilde]], member of the society in the 19th century]]\nIn November 1842,<ref name=Thom>{{cite book|title=Thom's Directory of Ireland|year=1850|publisher=Alexander Thom|location=Dublin|page=281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6V4NAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA281}}</ref> to mark the original session date the '''Dublin Philosophical Society''' was fully reformed under its original name, traditionally meeting on Mondays, to cater for those Trinity College students too young to join other societies in Dublin. The first meeting took place in [[Marlborough Street, Dublin|Marlborough Street]].<ref name=\"Book Of TCD\">{{Cite book |last=various |url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/61000/61000-h/61000-h.htm |title=The Book of Trinity College, Dublin, 1591-1891 |publisher=[[Marcus Ward & Co.]] |year=1892 |via=[[Project Gutenberg]] |section=THE COLLEGE SOCIETIES}}</ref>\n\nAt the time, undergraduates were not allowed to join most College societies, such as the [[College Historical Society]]. It then became the '''Dublin University Philosophical Society''' in February 1843<ref name=\"Keenan & O'Hare\" /><ref name=Thom />  when it was recognized by the college, with then [[Provost (education)|Provost]] [[Franc Sadleir]] reassuming the traditional role of Senior Patron.\n\nDuring this time the society had its rooms in No.4 (now House 4) in [[Trinity College, Dublin#Buildings and Grounds|Parliament Square]]<ref name=Bailey>{{cite journal|last=Bailey|first=Kenneth Claude|title=A History of Trinity College, Dublin, 1892-1945|journal=Hermathena|date=May 1948|volume=71|page=155}}</ref>  with larger meetings taking place within the [[Trinity College, Dublin#Buildings and Grounds|Examination Hall]].\n\nIn 1860, the Dublin University Philosophical Society changed its name to the '''University Philosophical Society'''. This makes the Phil the oldest, student, paper-reading, and collegial society in the world,<ref name=\"Keenan & O'Hare\" /> as well as currently being the largest such society in Ireland.\n\n===20th Century===\nThe society suffered greatly, with the rest of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]] during the [[World War I|First World War]]. [[Ireland]] was still part of the [[British Empire]] during the outbreak of the war and so many [[Irish people|Irish]] enlisted. However, there was a diverse mixture between members who predominantly described as being part of the [[Protestant Ascendancy]] and those who believed more in [[Irish republicanism]].\n[[File:1937 Reading Room (Trinity College, Dublin).jpg|thumb|right|150px|The 1937 Reading Room, [[World War I memorials|Memorial]] to members of the [[Trinity College, Dublin|college]] who died during the [[World War I|First World War]]]]\n\nThe meetings and overall strength of the society was massively diminished during the period, with there being no Inaugural Meeting from 1913 until 1919 after the end of the war.\n\nFrom 1913 (229th Session) to 1916 (231st Session) ten officers of the society resigned their positions to enlist. [[Minutes]] from the time mention that many more members of the society would go on to enlist, however their names went unrecorded.\n\nIn 1919 the names of eight past officers and members of council of the society who had been killed during the war was read aloud at the Opening Meeting.\n\n* James Austin, President 1913-1914 (229th Session).\n* AEL West, President 1915-1916 (231st Session).\n* Reverend Everard Digges La Touche, Seceratary 1907-1908 (223rd Session).\n* JHF Leland, Treasurer 1909-1910 (225th Session).\n* Walter Osborne Varian, Treasurer 1915-1916 (231st Session).\n* JS West, Registrar 1914-1915 (230th Session).\n* Francis George McGibney, Member of Council 1912-1913 (228th Session).\n* William Kee, Member of Council 1914-1915 (230th Session).\n\n{{Quotation|''Of them and those other members who gave up their lives, we can only say that while the University Philosophical Society stands they shall not be forgotten, since such men, by their deaths, have conferred on their Society, and on all connected with them, an honour that does not fade.''|Society Records| extract from the first Opening meeting of the Society in 1919. }}\n\nThe [[Irish War of Independence]] began shortly after the beginning of 1919, public and political will to remember those lost during the war was weak. This meant that the names of many more members of the society who were also killed during the [[World War I|First World War]] went unrecorded by the society.\n\nThe [[World War II|Second World War]], had a lesser effect on the society, though one notable President of the early 1940s was lawyer, Nigerian independence activist and Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Udo Udoma]].\n\n===Dublin University Elizabethan Society (\"The Eliz\")===\n[[File:DU Elizabethan Society Crest.png|thumb|right|180px| Crest of the Dublin University Elizabethan Society]]\nThe first female students were admitted to the [[Trinity College Dublin|college]] in 1904, however they were unable to join any of the student societies that existed at the time. In response to this the '''Dublin University Elizabethan Society''' (more commonly known as ''The Eliz'') was founded in 1905 by the first woman student of the university [[Isabel Marion Weir Johnston]].<ref name=\"Trinity News Nov. 1964\">{{cite news|title=Eliz. Jubilee|newspaper=Trinity News.|date=26 November 1964}}</ref>  The society was a female-only debating society, having sent teams to the [[Irish Times Debate|Irish Times National Debating Championship]] from relatively early in the competitions history. It also hosted many debates, paper discussions, group discussions and the Eliz Garden Party (within [[Trinity College Dublin#Buildings and grounds|Fellow's Square]]) which was considered one of the social highlights of [[Trinity term]] in the college. Each year the society welcomed esteemed guests to speak on topics regarding the history, the societal limitations of women and feminism. These included such guests as [[Ninette de Valois]], dancer and founder of [[The Royal Ballet]], who visited in late 1964 to celebrate the society's 60th year.<ref name=\"Trinity News Feb. 1964\">{{cite news|title=Men - no instinctive profession- de Valois|newspaper=Trinity News.|date=20 February 1964}}</ref>\n\nThe society had its rooms in No.6 (now House 6) in [[Trinity College Dublin#Buildings and grounds|Parliament Square]], housing many amenities for female students within the college, including one of only a handful of female [[Toilet (room)|toilets]] on the campus.\n\nAs mentioned in the following section, over the years there had been great debate within both the University Philosophical Society and the Dublin University Elizabethan Society regarding a merger of both societies into one. There was strong individual opposition within both societies however, with a vote in 1968<ref name=\"Trinity News Feb. 1968\">{{cite news|newspaper=Trinity News.|date=1 February 1968}}</ref>  by the Eliz rejecting a merger. However, in 1981 the Dublin University Elizabethan Society merged with the University Philosophical Society, which vastly increased female membership and increased debating within the society.\n\nToday as a symbolic gesture, the highest ranking female officer of the Phil is accorded the honorary title of '''President of the Elizabethan Society'''.\n\n====Inclusion of Women====\nIt was the 1953/54 session of the Phil that first welcomed in long overdue gender equality advances: Women were at last allowed to attend public business meetings and then also to speak at them (provided though Standing Orders were suspended!). What is more, at the end of that session, membership was actually even opened up to them. Sadly though, this final breakthrough proved short-lived as the College Board after a gap of only one term \u2013 and although it had no direct constitutional jurisdiction here \u2013 in early 1955 voted down female membership for that year pending possible reorganisation of the Major Societies.<ref name=\"Trinity News Feb. 1955\">{{cite news|date=3 February 1955|newspaper=Trinity News.}}</ref> It was an understandable decision perhaps from the Board's point of view except that even more sadly such restructuring was never led by them as announced or indeed subsequently. While reorganisations and possible mergers between the Phil and the Hist and the Phil and the Eliz and the Phil and the SRC (Student Representative Council) + the Eliz surfaced variously at periodic intervals actual plans \u2018with legs\u2019 never seemed to result. Divisions and maybe feelings of self-interest within and between the different factions, the continuing unwillingness/inability of the College for some reason to meaningfully grapple with this process and, what is more, effectively address the issue of student union type facilities that were commonplace in other institutions of higher education all seemingly presented insurmountable hurdles.\n\nIndeed, it wasn't until session 1963/64 that a further vote taken by the Phil on the admission of women, although it was lost by only 3 votes. Some advances were though made: From that session onwards, it was agreed that women could at last reply to papers read to the Society and, in 1965, Joanna Walmsley became the first woman to read her paper to the society. (It wasentitled \"Tolstoy - Realist or Moralist?\").<ref name=\"Trinity News Feb. 1965\">{{cite news|title=Jo Walmsley at the Phil|date=18 February 1965|newspaper=Trinity News.}}</ref> One of concerns held over the years had been that the Society's facilities were generally inadequate for a larger mixed membership. In session 1967/1968.<ref name=\"Trinity News April 1967\">{{cite news|title=Phiz Explodes in Bitterness|date=13 April 1967|newspaper=Trinity News.}}</ref> opposition even led then President of the Phil (Gordon Ledbetter) to resign in exasperation.<ref name=\"Trinity News April 1967\" /> It was a matter though that wasn't going to go away. At the first Council meeting and a subsequent private business in the following session (1967\u201368), this aspect again prominently featured as a concern. There were also many in the Phil who felt the way forward would be achieved through revisiting the idea of a merger with the Eliz to form a super sized Major Society.  However, even setting to one side the thorny issue of finding satisfactory accommodation for such a body, it also turned out to be the case this time - as it had previously that the Eliz just weren't sufficiently interested such a proposal. (That was of course to change some years later).\n\nWith such topics under the spotlight, a feeling though also started to emerge from the active membership that discussion was going around in circles once again. The halfway house with regards to female participation was just unsatisfactory.  For quite sincerely held reasons of equal rights and inclusivity and indeed on a practical level to revitalise our business and expand membership the Society had to try and go it alone regardless.  So a motion calling for women to quite simply be admitted as full members was proposed, debated at Private Business on 30th. November 1967...and was elatedly passed! <ref name=\"Trinity News Jan. 1968\">{{cite news|date=18 January 1968|newspaper=Trinity News}}</ref> The then President of the Phil (Geoff Goolnik) pointed out to those gathered that restrictions on female membership had in fact been a matter of convention as gender was never once mentioned in the then current Laws \u2013 unlike with those of the two other Major Societies, viz.the Eliz and the Hist (College Historical Society).\n\n At the following private business meeting held on 5th. December three women were proposed and voted in as members \u2013 including the then President of the Eliz (Elizabeth Hall) who was appropriately nominated by Goolnik and seconded by \u2018Gully\u2019 Stanford, the then Auditor of the Hist, in his capacity as an ordinary member of the Phil!  Finally, the first female member to address the Society after it had become gender free, Gr\u00e1inne Monks, was also elected on 1st. February 1968 as the first female member of Council.\n\nIn Trinity News\u2019 edition of 25th. November 1953,  an anonymous female contributor had declared that \"The bar to the admission of women to [the other] major societies ...is a real deprivation to everyone \u2013 to College women, to the members of the societies, themselves and, most important, to the University\".<ref name=\"Trinity News Nov. 1968\">{{cite news|title=*A Woman's Point of View|url=http://www.trinitynewsarchive.ie/25pdf/01-05.pdf|accessdate=12 March 2015|newspaper=Trinity News|date=25 November 1953|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519173408/http://http/|archivedate=19 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Fifteen years and five days later the Phil at least eventually, permanently and proudly righted that wrong.\n\n===21st Century===\nToday the University Philosophical Society is the largest student society within the college and Ireland. Its meetings include weekly paper readings and debates. Additionally it invites many internationally esteemed guests each year, regularly interviews with public figures, which have included [[Al Pacino]], [[Desmond Tutu]], [[Angela Merkel]] and [[Stephen Fry]].\n\n===Notable events===\nAmong the notable events held was the demonstration of an early [[telephone]] by Stephen Yeates in 1865.\n\n==Governance==\nThe Phil is governed by a Council elected by the members of the society each year. There are eight officers: President, Secretary, Treasurer, Registrar, Debates Convenor, Librarian, Steward, and Schools Convenor. All officers are directly elected. In addition to the officers are a fourteen Members of Council. The Members of Council serve as deputies to the officers, aid in the execution of their responsibilities and any other such work necessary for the efficient running of the society. Six are directly elected each year. One of these six is then selected by the Council to serve as Vice President of the society. The Senior Member of Council is also elected in the same manner as the officers of the society and is delegated the responsibility of co-ordinating the other Members of Council. The newly elected Council may then add up to seven further Members of Council via [[co-option]].\n\n[[File:Trinity College Dublin 4.jpg|thumb|right|The Graduates Memorial Building (G.M.B.) home to the University Philosophical Society since the beginning of the 20th century.]]\n\n==The Bram Stoker Club==\n[[File:Bram Stoker.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Bram Stoker]], former President of the Society, who presented \"Sensationalism in Fiction and Society\" as his first paper]]\nIn addition to its usual events, the society added a sub-group, the '''Bram Stoker Club''' (more commonly known as '''Bram'''), to its organization in 2011. Named after one of the Phil's most illustrious presidents ([[Bram Stoker]]), the club holds weekly afternoon paper-readings on a range of topics. These paper-readings have served to carry on the long tradition of the society, which had fallen slightly out of fashion in recent years.\n\nIn January 2013, the Club was incorporated into the official [[law]]s of the University Philosophical Society by majority vote. This was then officially recognised by the Dublin University Central Societies Committee in March of the same year.\n\nIt had its first foray outside of College in 2013, entering the winning team of John Engle and Liam Brophy in that years [[Irish Times Debate|Irish Times National Debating Championship]].<ref name=\"Irish Times\">{{cite news|last=Moriarty|first=Gerry|title=TCD Bram Stoker Club wins 'Irish Times' Debate in Queen's|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/tcd-bram-stoker-club-wins-irish-times-debate-in-queen-s-1.1314086|accessdate=22 May 2013|newspaper=The Irish Times|date=23 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 4th Session, the club welcomed three living descendants of its namesake Bram Stoker. Noel Dobbs, Robin MacCaw and [[Dacre Stoker]] met with members of the club and society at large. Each presented papers on the history of Bram Stoker and legacy of [[Dracula]] within their family. Also in attendance was distant relative and [[Seanad \u00c9ireann|Senator]] [[David Norris (politician)|David Norris]]. Finally the Stoker family presented the club with portrait of Bram Stoker by Dublin artist Damian Byrne, and a plaque specifying the connection between the society and their ancestor.\n\n==Competitive debating==\nThe society endeavors each year to enable its membership to engage in competitive debating both externally and internally to the college. This includes holding workshops, regular weekly competitive debates, as well as traveling to other colleges throughout Ireland and abroad to compete in similar competitions.\n\n===External Debating Competitions===\nThe society has a strong presence and list of accomplishment on the competitive debating circuit. Having first won the [[Irish Times Debate|Irish Times National Debating Championship]] in 1961 the society has gone on to win and place in several other well known debating competitions. These include the [[John Smith Memorial Mace]], [[World Universities Debating Championship]], [[NUIG Literary and Debating Society#Activities|Irish National Law Debates]], [[UCC Philosophical Society#Competitive events|Cork IV]] and the [[Literary and Historical Society (University College Dublin)#UCD Vice Presidents' Cup IV|UCD Vice Presidents' Cup IV]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n<!-- Before adding a list of achievements, consider that these should be referenced -->\n\n===Internal Debating Competitions===\nThe society runs several internal debating competitions each year.\nThese consist of:\n*The Eamon O'Coine Memorial Maiden Speaker's Competition (or \"Maidens\"); for first-time speakers in college.\n*The Jeremy Clarkson Memorial Debating Competition (or \"Clarkies\"), consisting of a series of regular weekly debates.; satirically named after TV presenter [[Jeremy Clarkson]]. Formerly known as The Maggies, after former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] \n*The Elizabethan Society Memorial Pro-Am Competition (or \"Lizzies\"); a competition whereby experienced debaters (Pros) are teamed with less experienced speakers (Ams). \n* The Isabel Marion Weir Johnston Memorial (or \"Izzy's\"); is an internal competition for all members of the society. It is named in honour of the first woman to enter Trinity where she went on to found the Elizabethan Society which later merged with the Philosophical Society.\n*The J.P Mahaffy Memorial (or \"Mahaffy's\"); named after former President of the society [[John Pentland Mahaffy]] internal debating competition for [[Student#Ireland|Junior Freshman]] (\"fresher\") teams of two.\n\n===Trinity Inter-varsity===\nEach year, normally in January, the society jointly with the [[College Historical Society|Hist]] hosts the [[Trinity IV|Claire Stewart Trinity IV]]. Before 2015 this consisted of the Trinity Invitational and the [[Jonathan Swift|Dean Swift]] Intervarsity. In 2015, the Trinity Invitational was replaced with Trinity Women's Debating Competition.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tcdphil.com/?page_id=2254 |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161002075529/http://tcdphil.com/?page_id=2254 |archive-date=2 October 2016 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Phil Speaks==\n[[File:Phil Speaks Logo.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Phil Speaks Logo]]\n'''The Phil Speaks Debating and Public Speaking Initiative''', more commonly known as '''Phil Speaks''' is a campaign aimed at promoting, as well as developing skills in public speaking and oratory. Formed by the society in 2004 the initiative combines in-school oratory workshops, with Pro\u2013Am (Professional-Amateur) learning competitions to encourage these skills in students of all secondary [[school]]s throughout [[Ireland]].\n\nAt the end of the contest, the society hosts the Phil Speaks Competitive Weekend modelled on the format of a University Intervarsity Competition held within the [[Graduates Memorial Building]], with the grand final taking place in the [[Graduates Memorial Building#Interior|Debating Chamber]].\n\n==Awards==\nAnnually, the society internally awards the author of the best paper and the best [[Graduates Memorial Building#Interior|chamber]] speaker from its membership, medals of [[Public speaking|oratory]] and [[Composition (language)|composition]].\n\nThe society also awards the Gold Medal of Honorary Patronage and the Bram Stoker Medal to various esteemed guests each year.\n\n===Central Societies Committee of Trinity College Dublin===\n{{unreferenced section|date=February 2020}}\nThe society has a strong record{{fact|date=February 2020}} of being the recipient of several awards by the internal Central Societies Committee of [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]].{{fact|date=February 2020}} In recent years these include:{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Award\n|-\n|2019\n|''Best Event'', for 'This House Believes that Society is Failing People with Disabilities'.\n|-\n|2018\n|' 'Best Poster' ', 'Club Philth'\n|-\n|2015\n|''Best Large Society''.\n|-\n|2013 \n|''Individual of the Year'', awarded to President Lorcan Clarke (328th Session).\n|-\n|2013\n|''Best Online Web Presence''.\n|-\n|2012 \n|''Best Large Society''.\n|-\n|2011 \n|''Individual of the Year'', awarded to President Declan Meehan (326th Session).\n|-\n|2010 \n|''Best Event'', for the Oscar Wilde Festival (jointly awarded to [[List of Trinity College, Dublin student organisations#Dublin University Players|DU Players]]).\n|-\n|}\n\n===Board of Irish College Societies===\nThe Board of Irish College Societies (BICS) is a national organisation, constituted in 1995, dedicated to providing a national forum for the societies in Ireland's Universities, Colleges and Institutes of Education. The Board is responsible for the promotion of interest in the activities of Irish college societies and of contact and co-operation between them.\n\nThe University Philosophical Society has formidable history of achievement:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|-\n!Year\n!Award\n|-\n|2013\n|''Best individual (Large Society)'', awarded to 328th Session President Lorcan Clarke.\n|-\n|2009\n|''Best Event (Large Society)'', awarded for The Trials of Oscar Wilde.\n|-\n|}\n\n==Honorary patrons==\nThrough its years in college, the Society has recorded the presence of many notable guests, the most distinguished of whom are named honorary patrons of the society. Included amongst these are multiple [[Nobel Prize]] laureates, both before and after their receipt of the Prize, such as [[W. B. Yeats]], Heads of State and of Government, notable actors and musicians, as well as well-known intellectuals. Guests have also included all [[Taoiseach|Taoisigh]] since [[Charles Haughey]].\n\n[[File:John Mearsheimer.jpg|thumb|right|120px| [[John Mearsheimer]], awarded the Honorary Patronage in 2012.]]\n\n==Controversies==\nMany guests which the Phil has invited over the years have courted controversy. Contributors to its debates included [[Oswald Mosley]] during his residence in Ireland. In 1988, the Society invited then\u2013[[Holocaust denial|Holocaust denier]] [[David Irving]] to speak. A large protest by students, staff, Jewish groups, socialists, and anti-Nazi activists resulted in the meeting being relocated to a hotel conference room and held in the small hours of the morning. The traditional vote of thanks to Mr Irving for his paper was defeated, which is rare in the society's history.\n[[File:David irving.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Irving was a highly controversial guest speaker who caused protests during his visit.]]\n\nThe address of [[Austria]]n politician [[J\u00f6rg Haider]] to the society in late 2002 led to a protest by self-described anti-fascist activists, which continued through the debate, with noise being made outside the chamber and interjections in the society's proceedings within. An invitation to [[British National Party]] (BNP) official Tony Wentworth was revoked after threats of physical action by leftist groups.\n\nAnother guest to generate controversy was [[Islamist]] [[Anjem Choudary]], who hailed the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|9/11]] terrorists as martyrs. Former Taoiseach [[John Bruton]] threatened to withdraw from a Phil debate later that year over this invitation, which was not withdrawn. Mr Bruton later became an Honorary Patron of the Society, and Anjem Choudary has been invited to speak at the Phil's lectern several times.\n\nIn 2011, the Phil encountered controversy when it invited [[British National Party|BNP]] leader [[Nick Griffin]] to speak at a Thursday night debate on immigration. After raging protests, talks with college officials and physical threats made to the members and council the invitation was reluctantly withdrawn by the President of the 327th session, Eoin O'Liathain. In a press statement the Phil said that \"it is unfortunate that circumstances have arisen under which the planned debate can no longer go ahead without compromising the safety of staff and students\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/?p=5211|title=Phil statement on the withdrawal of the invitation to BNP leader Nick Griffin|website=www.universitytimes.ie}}</ref> Despite these challenges the session would go on to be voted Best Society in Trinity College that year.\n\nIn 2015, members of the Phil were asked by the President to collect copies of ''[[The University Times]]'' after the newspaper printed details of confidential correspondence that had been supplied to the newspaper in the understanding that it would not be referred to in an article. While ''The University Times'' subsequently agreed to withdraw the edition of the paper in question from circulation, ''[[Trinity News]]'' reported that members of council had discussed calling a motion to impeach the president as a result of the society's actions in collecting the newspapers.<ref>http://trinitynews.ie/ut-withdrawn-phil-removes-papers/</ref> A motion of confidence in the president was later passed at a general meeting of the society.<ref>http://trinitynews.ie/editorial-stand-by-peers/</ref> The incident was cited as one of the factors leading to Samuel Riggs, then the editor of ''The University Times'', agreeing to take a permanent leave of absence from his position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.universitytimes.ie/2015/03/samuel-riggs-to-take-leave-of-absence-from-position-as-editor/|title=Samuel Riggs to Take Leave of Absence from Position as Editor|website=www.universitytimes.ie}}</ref>\n\n==Notable members==\n[[File:Samuel Beckett, 1977.jpeg|thumb|150px| [[Samuel Beckett]], former member of the society]]\n\n===Academia===\n* [[Robert Stawell Ball]], [[List of Scholars of Trinity College Dublin|ex-Sch.]], Royal Astronomer of Ireland and [[Lowndean Professor of Astronomy and Geometry]] at the [[University of Cambridge]].

Because the First Nations people did most of the work of beaver hunting, the company needed few French employees. But the severely underpopulated New France almost fell completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In 1660, settler [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]] led a Canadian and Huron [[militia]] against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, but they succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion. In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement. In 1663, New France finally became more secure when [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] made it a royal province, taking control away from the [[Company of One Hundred Associates]].

In 1665, [[Jean Talon]] was sent by Minister of the Marine [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] to New France as the first Intendant. These reforms limited the power of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]], who had held the greatest amount of power after the death of Champlain.\n\nThe [[1666 census of New France]] was conducted by France's intendant, Jean Talon, in the winter of 1665\u201366.

Approximately 800 arrived during 1663\u20131673. The King's Daughters found husbands among the male settlers within a year or two, as well as a new life for themselves. They came on their own choice, many because they could not make a favorable marriage in the social hierarchy in France. They were from commoner families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France.

It achieved this in great part due to its particular location along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. From here a new economy emerged, one of size and density that provided increased economic opportunities for the inhabitants of New France. In December 1627 the [[Company of New France]] was recognized and given commercial rights to the gathering and export of [[furs]] from French territories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=E.

As a result, it was able to set specific price points for furs and other valuable goods, often doing so to protect its economic hegemony over other trading partners and other areas of the economy.\n\nThe fur trade itself was based on a [[commodity]] of small bulk but yet high value. Because of this it managed to attract increased attention and/or input capital that would otherwise be intended for other areas of the economy. The Montreal area witnessed a stagnant agricultural sector; it remained for the most part subsistence orientated with little or no trade purposes outside of the French [[colony]]. This was a prime example of the handicapping effect the [[fur trade]] had on its neighbouring areas of the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Innis |first=H.A. |title=Significant Factors in Canadian Economic Development |journal=Canadian Historical Review |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=374\u2013384 |date=1937 |doi=10.3138/CHR-018-04-02}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, by the beginning of the 1700s the economic prosperity the fur trade stimulated slowly transformed Montreal. Economically, it was no longer a town of small traders or of fur fairs but rather a city of merchants and of bright lights. The primary sector of the [[fur trade]], the act of acquiring and the selling of the furs, quickly promoted the growth of complementary second and tertiary sectors of the economy. For instance a small number of tanneries was established in Montreal as well as a larger number of inns, taverns and markets that would support the growing number of inhabitants whose livelihood depended on the fur trade. Already by 1683 there were well over 140 families and there may have been as many as 900 people living in Montreal.\n\nThe founding of the [[Compagnie des Indes]] in 1718, once again highlighted the economic importance of the fur trade.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wien |first=Thomas |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/1990/v1/n1/031021ar.pdf |title=Selling Beaver Skins in North America and Europe, 1720\u20131760: The Uses of Fur-Trade Imperialism |journal=Journal of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=1990 |pp=293\u2013317 |doi=10.7202/031021ar}}</ref> This merchant association, like its predecessor the Compagnie des Cent Associes, regulated the fur trade to the best of its abilities imposing price points, supporting government sale taxes and combating black market practices.

This eventually resulted in the repeal of the 25 percent sales tax that had previously aimed at curbing the administrative costs New France had accumulated. In addition, dwindling supply increased black market trading. A greater number of indigenous groups and fur traders began circumventing [[Montreal]] and New France altogether; many began trading with either [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchants to the south.<ref name = \"illegalfurtrade\"/>\n\nBy the end of French rule in New France in 1763, the fur trade had significantly lost its importance as the key stable good that supported much of New France's economy for more than the last century. Even so, it did serve as the fundamental force behind the establishment and vast growth of Montreal and the French colony.\n\n===Coureurs des bois and voyageurs===\n[[File:Arrival of Radisson in an Indian camp 1660 Charles William Jefferys.jpg|thumb|The arrival of [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] in an Amerindian camp in 1660]]\nThe [[coureurs des bois]] were responsible for starting the flow of trade from [[Montreal]], carrying [[France|French]] goods into upper territories while indigenous people were bringing down their [[furs]]. The coureurs traveled with intermediate trading tribes, and found that they were anxious to prevent French access to the more distant fur-hunting tribes. Still, the coureurs kept thrusting outwards using the [[Ottawa River]] as their initial step upon the journey and keeping Montreal as their starting point.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/> The Ottawa River was significant because it offered a route that was practical for Europeans, by taking the traders northward out of the territory dominated by the [[Iroquois]]. It was for this reason that Montreal and the Ottawa River was a central location of indigenous warfare and rivalry.\n\nMontreal faced difficulties by having too many coureurs out in the woods. The furs coming down were causing an oversupply on the markets of [[Europe]]. This challenged the coureurs trade because they so easily evaded controls, monopolies, and taxation, and additionally because the coureurs trade was held to debauch both French and various indigenous groups. The coureur debauched Frenchmen by accustoming them to fully live with indigenous, and indigenous by trading on their desire for alcohol.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nThe issues caused a great rift in the [[colony]], and in 1678, it was confirmed by a General Assembly that the trade was to be made in public so as to better assure the safety of the indigenous population. It was also forbidden to take spirits inland to trade with indigenous groups. However these restrictions on the coureurs, for a variety of reasons, never worked. The [[fur trade]] remained dependent on spirits, and increasingly in the hands of the coureurs who journeyed north in search of furs.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nAs time passed, the Coureurs des bois were partially replaced by licensed fur trading endeavors, and the main canoe travel workers of those endeavors were called [[voyageurs]].\n\n===Indigenous peoples===\n[[File:Woodlands Shirt, c. 1720-1750.jpg|thumb|Leather Shirt, c. 1720-1750.

Made of antelope hide, the interlocking abstract painted designs probably represent the sacred [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]].]]\nThe [[French people|French]] were interested in exploiting the land through the fur trade as well as the timber trade later on. Despite having tools and guns, the French settlers were dependent on Indigenous people to survive in the difficult climate in this part of North America. Many settlers did not know how to survive through the winter; the Indigenous people showed them how to survive in the New World. They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months.<ref>{{cite book |last=Friders |first=James S. |title=Native Peoples in Canada: Contemporary Conflicts |location=Scarborough: Ontario |publisher=Prentice-Hall Canada |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-1301-2204-9}}</ref>\n\nAs the fur trade became the dominant economy in the New World, French voyageurs, trappers and hunters often married or formed relationships with Indigenous women. This allowed the French to develop relations with their wives' Indigenous nations, which in turn provided protection and access to their hunting and trapping grounds.\n\nThe fur trade benefited Indigenous people as well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Tools such as knives, pots and kettles, nets, firearms and hatchets improved the general welfare of indigenous peoples. At the same time, while everyday life became easier, some traditional ways of doing things were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar, sometimes with deleterious effect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |last2=Lewis |first2=Frank D. |title=Commerce by Frozen Sea: Native Americans and the European Fur Trade |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0812204827 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjc34n1z8pYC&pg=PP1}}</ref>\n\n===Formal entry of England in New France area fur trade===\n[[File:Claude Bernou Carte de lAmerique septentrionale.jpg|thumb|1681 French map of the New World above the equator: New France and the [[Great Lakes]] in the north, with a dark line as the [[Mississippi River]] to the west in the [[Illinois Country]] and the mouth of the river (and future New Orleans) then ''[[terra incognita]]'']]\n\nSince [[Henry Hudson]] had claimed [[Hudson Bay]], and the surrounding lands for England in 1611, English colonists had begun expanding their boundaries across what is now the [[Canada|Canadian]] north beyond the French-held territory of New France.

The French forces went on the attack first in a failed attempt to capture [[Annapolis Royal]], the capital of the British Nova Scotia. In 1745, [[William Shirley]], governor of [[Massachusetts]], led a counterattack on Louisbourg. Both France and New France were unable to relieve the siege, and Louisbourg fell to the British. With the famed [[Duc d'Anville Expedition]], France attempted to retake Acadia and the fortress in 1746 but failed. The fortress was returned to France under the [[Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748)|Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle]], but the peace treaty, which restored all colonial borders to their pre-war status, did little to end the lingering enmity between France, Britain, and their respective colonies, nor did it resolve any territorial disputes.\n\n===Father Le Loutre's War===\n{{Main|Father Le Loutre's War}}\n\nWithin Acadia and Nova Scotia, [[Father Le Loutre's War]] (1749\u20131755) began with the British founding of [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax]].

A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here, but a French force under [[Claude-Pierre P\u00e9caudy de Contrec\u0153ur]] drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony, and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the indigenous peoples of the area.\n\nIn 1755, General [[Edward Braddock]] led [[Braddock Expedition|an expedition]] against Fort Duquesne, and although they were numerically superior to the French militia and their Indian allies, Braddock's army was routed and Braddock was killed.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9580/ |title=The Battle of the Monongahela |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1755 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> Later that same year at the Battle of Lake George, the British General William Johnson with a force of 1700 American and Iroquois troops defeated a French force of 2800 French and Canadians and 700 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] led by Baron Dieskau (Military commander of New France).\n\nThe fight for control over Ohio Country led to the [[French and Indian War]], which began as the North American phase of the [[Seven Years' War]] (which did not technically begin in Europe until 1756). The war began with the defeat of a Virginia militia contingent led by Colonel [[George Washington]] by the French [[troupes de la marine]] in the [[Ohio Country|Ohio valley]]. As a result of that defeat, the British decided to prepare the conquest of Quebec City, the capital of New France. The British defeated France in Acadia in the [[Battle of Fort Beausejour]] (1755) and then [[\u00cele Royale (New France)|\u00cele Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]) (which also administered \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]].\n\nThroughout the war, the British forcibly removed the Acadians from their lands, which the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias resisted. The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]] continued from 1755 to 1764.\n\nThese British military successes were resisted, with successes by the French and Native Americans. In 1756, a large force of French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by Marquis de Montcalm launched an attack against the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7200 French and Canadians and 2400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. But many of the Native Americans were hungry for scalps and loot, so when the British force with civilians were three miles from the fort they massacred about 1100 of the 1500 strong force.\n\nThe following year the French had one victory and one defeat. The defeat was at the French fortress city of Louisbourg. The victory was at the strip of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George at the French fortress of Fort Carillon. The British force sent to capture Fort Carillon (held by just 3400 French regulars and marines with almost no militia or indigenous support) was the largest ever seen in America at that time: 16,200 British, American, and Iroquois troops under the command of General James Abercrombie. This battle cost the British 2200 troops, several artillery pieces against French losses of around 200 killed or wounded.\n\nWhile the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710, the French continued to remain a significant force in the region with [[Fort Beausejour]] and [[Fortress Louisbourg]]. The dominant population in the region remained Acadian, that is to say, not British. In 1755, the British were successful in the [[Battle of Beausejour]] and immediately after began the [[expulsion of the Acadians]]. \n\nIn the meantime the French continued to explore westwards and expand their trade alliances with indigenous peoples. [[Fort de la Corne]] was built in 1753, by [[Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne]] just east of the [[Saskatchewan River Forks]] in what is today the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]]. This was the furthest westward outpost of the French Empire in North America to be established before its fall.\n\n==Treaties of cession==\n{{further|Conquest of New France (1758-1760)}}\nIn 1758, British forces again [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|captured Louisbourg]], allowing them to blockade the entrance to the St. Lawrence River. This proved decisive in the war. In 1759, the British besieged Quebec by sea, and an army under General [[James Wolfe]] defeated the French under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in September. The garrison in Quebec surrendered on 18 September, and by the next year New France had been conquered by the British after [[Montreal Campaign|the attack on Montreal]], which had refused to acknowledge the fall of Canada. The last French governor-general of New France, [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal]], surrendered to British Major General [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] on 8 September 1760.

The [[Louisiana Territory]], under [[Spain|Spanish]] control since the end of the Seven Years' War, remained off-limits to settlement from the thirteen American colonies.\n\nTwelve years after the British defeated the French, the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in the Thirteen Colonies. Many French Canadians would take part in the war, including Major [[Cl\u00e9ment Gosselin]] and Admiral [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil]]. After the British surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]] in 1781, the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] gave all former British claims in New France below the [[Great Lakes]] into the possession of the nascent [[United States]]. A Franco-Spanish alliance treaty returned Louisiana to France in 1801, but French leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold it to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, ending French colonial efforts in North America.\n\nThe portions of the former New France that remained under British rule were administered as [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], 1791\u20131841, and then those regions were merged as the [[Province of Canada]] during 1841\u20131867, when the passage of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act of 1867]] instituted [[home rule]] for most of British North America and established French-speaking Quebec (the former Lower Canada) as one of the original provinces of the [[Confederation of Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. The former French colony of Acadia was first designated the [[Colony of Nova Scotia]] but shortly thereafter the [[Colony of New Brunswick]], which then included Prince Edward Island, was split off from it.\n\nIn Canada, the legacy of New France can be seen in the enduring [[Canadian identity#French Canadians and Identity in English Canada|Francophone identity]] of its descendants, which has led to [[Bilingualism in Canada|institutional bilingualism]] in Canada as a whole.\n\nThe only remnant of the former colonial territory of New France that remains under French control to this day is the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] (French: Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), consisting of a group of small islands {{convert|25|km|mi nmi}} off the coast of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Canada.\n\n==Political divisions of New France==\n[[File:Constitution-of-new-france-1759.png|thumb|A chart showing the political organization of New France, c. 1759]]\nThe territory of New France was divided into five colonies, each with its own administration: [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], Hudson's Bay, [[Acadia]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|(Plaisance)]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=Francis2009 /><ref name=Territoire /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=canada_new_france |title=Canada at the Time of New France  |date=2004  |author=University of Ottawa |accessdate= March 24, 2017}}</ref> The Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of [[Cape Breton Island|\u00cele Royale]], now called Cape Breton Island, where the French built the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]].<ref name=Johnston2001 /><ref name=Louisbourg /> Acadia had a difficult history, with the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]], remembered on [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|July 28]] each year since 2003. The [[Acadians|descendants]] are dispersed in the Maritime Provinces of Canada, in Maine and Louisiana in the United States, with small populations in [[Ch\u00e9ticamp, Nova Scotia]] and the [[Magdalen Islands#History|Magdalen Islands]].\n\nIn terms of 21st century political divisions and nations, New France included Acadia (eastern Quebec, the coastal territories, and claims to New England as far as Philadelphia, Canada (modern eastern Canada and the Canadian plains in central Canada to the edge of modern-day Alberta), and Louisiana (a vast territory stretching across much of the east half of modern Midwestern United States).\n\n* [[Acadia|Province of Acadia]]\n* [[Canada (New France)|Canada]]\n** [[Illinois Country]] (before 1717)\n* [[French Louisiana]]\n** Illinois Country (after 1717)\n\n==Historiography==\nThe Conquest (referring to the fall of New France to the British, and specifically the events of 1759-60) has always been a central and contested theme of Canadian memory. Some Anglophone historians portray the Conquest as a victory for \"British military, political and economic superiority\" and argue that it ultimately brought benefits to the French settlers.<ref name=Jaenen/> However, Cornelius Jaenen notes that French-Canadian historians remain strongly divided on the subject. One group sees it as a highly negative economic, political and ideological disaster that threatened a way of life with materialism and Protestantism. At the other pole are those historians who see the positive benefit of enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule.<ref name=Jaenen>{{cite book |last=Jaenen |first=Cornelius J. |title=Canada during the French regime |editor-last=Muise |editor-first=D.A. |work=A Reader's Guide to Canadian History: Volume 1: Beginnings to Confederation |year=1982 |page=[https://archive.org/details/readersguidetoca0000unse/page/40 40] |isbn=978-0-8020-6442-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/readersguidetoca0000unse/page/40 }}</ref> French-Canadian debates have escalated since the 1960s, as the conquest is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Qu\u00e9bec's nationalism. Francophone historian Jocelyn L\u00e9tourneau suggested in 2009, that today, \"1759 does not belong primarily to a past that we might wish to study and understand, but, rather, to a present and a future that we might wish to shape and control.\"<ref>{{cite book |first=Jocelyn |last=L\u00e9tourneau |title=What is to be done with 1759? |editor-first1=Phillip |editor-last1=Buckner |editor-last2=Reid |editor-first2=John G. |work=Remembering 1759: The Conquest of Canada in Historical Memory |publisher=University of Toronto Press |year=2012 |page=279 |isbn=978-1-4426-9924-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yiOOuORbGpAC&pg=PA279}}</ref>\n\nThe enduring contestation of the legacy of the Conquest can be exemplified by an episode in 2009, when an attempt to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the battle of the Plains of Abraham was cancelled. The explanation for the cancellation was that it was over security concerns, but activist Sylvain Rocheleau stated, \"[I think] they had to cancel the event because it was insulting a majority of Francophones.

Because the First Nations people did most of the work of beaver hunting, the company needed few French employees. But the severely underpopulated New France almost fell completely to hostile Iroquois forces. In 1660, settler [[Adam Dollard des Ormeaux]] led a Canadian and Huron [[militia]] against a much larger Iroquois force; none of the Canadians survived, but they succeeded in turning back the Iroquois invasion. In 1627, Quebec had only eighty-five French colonists and was easily overwhelmed two years later when three English privateers plundered the settlement.

In 1665, [[Jean Talon]] was sent by Minister of the Marine [[Jean-Baptiste Colbert]] to New France as the first Intendant. These reforms limited the power of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Quebec|Bishop of Quebec]], who had held the greatest amount of power after the death of Champlain.\n\nThe [[1666 census of New France]] was conducted by France's intendant, Jean Talon, in the winter of 1665\u201366.

Approximately 800 arrived during 1663\u20131673. The King's Daughters found husbands among the male settlers within a year or two, as well as a new life for themselves. They came on their own choice, many because they could not make a favorable marriage in the social hierarchy in France. They were from commoner families in the Paris area, Normandy and the central-western regions of France.

During the 16th and early 17th centuries New France's economy was heavily centered on its [[Atlantic]] fisheries. This would change in the later half of the 17th and 18th centuries as [[France|French]] settlement penetrated further into the continental interior.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Watkins |first=Melville H. |title=A Staple Theory of Economic Growth |journal=The Canadian Journal of Economics and Political Science |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=141\u2013158 |date=May 1963 |jstor=139461 |doi=10.2307/139461}}</ref> Here French economic interests would shift and concentrate itself on the development of the [[North American fur trade]].

It achieved this in great part due to its particular location along the [[St. Lawrence River]]. From here a new economy emerged, one of size and density that provided increased economic opportunities for the inhabitants of New France. In December 1627 the [[Company of New France]] was recognized and given commercial rights to the gathering and export of [[furs]] from French territories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Adair |first=E. R. |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ram/1942/v21/n1/300228ar.pdf |title=The Evolution of Montreal under the French Regime |journal=Report of the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=21 |issue=1 |date=1942 |pp=20\u201341 |doi=10.7202/300228ar}}</ref> By trading with various indigenous populations and securing the main markets its power grew steadily for the next decade. As a result, it was able to set specific price points for furs and other valuable goods, often doing so to protect its economic hegemony over other trading partners and other areas of the economy.\n\nThe fur trade itself was based on a [[commodity]] of small bulk but yet high value. Because of this it managed to attract increased attention and/or input capital that would otherwise be intended for other areas of the economy. The Montreal area witnessed a stagnant agricultural sector; it remained for the most part subsistence orientated with little or no trade purposes outside of the French [[colony]]. This was a prime example of the handicapping effect the [[fur trade]] had on its neighbouring areas of the [[economy]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Innis |first=H.A. |title=Significant Factors in Canadian Economic Development |journal=Canadian Historical Review |volume=18 |issue=4 |pages=374\u2013384 |date=1937 |doi=10.3138/CHR-018-04-02}}</ref>\n\nNonetheless, by the beginning of the 1700s the economic prosperity the fur trade stimulated slowly transformed Montreal. Economically, it was no longer a town of small traders or of fur fairs but rather a city of merchants and of bright lights. The primary sector of the [[fur trade]], the act of acquiring and the selling of the furs, quickly promoted the growth of complementary second and tertiary sectors of the economy. For instance a small number of tanneries was established in Montreal as well as a larger number of inns, taverns and markets that would support the growing number of inhabitants whose livelihood depended on the fur trade. Already by 1683 there were well over 140 families and there may have been as many as 900 people living in Montreal.\n\nThe founding of the [[Compagnie des Indes]] in 1718, once again highlighted the economic importance of the fur trade.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Wien |first=Thomas |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/jcha/1990/v1/n1/031021ar.pdf |title=Selling Beaver Skins in North America and Europe, 1720\u20131760: The Uses of Fur-Trade Imperialism |journal=Journal of the Canadian Historical Association |volume=1 |issue=1 |date=1990 |pp=293\u2013317 |doi=10.7202/031021ar}}</ref> This merchant association, like its predecessor the Compagnie des Cent Associes, regulated the fur trade to the best of its abilities imposing price points, supporting government sale taxes and combating black market practices. However, by the middle half of the 18th century the [[fur trade]] was in a slow decline.<ref name = \"illegalfurtrade\">{{cite journal |last=Lunn |first=Jean |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/ram/1939/v18/n1/300187ar.pdf |title=The Illegal Fur Trade out of New France, 1713\u201360 |journal=Report of the Annual Meeting of the Canadian Historical Association / Rapports Annuels de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Historique du Canada |volume=18 |number=1 |year=1939 |pages=61\u201376 |issn=0317-0594 |accessdate=20 February 2012 |doi=10.7202/300187ar}}</ref>\n\nThe natural abundance of furs had passed and it could no longer meet market demand. This eventually resulted in the repeal of the 25 percent sales tax that had previously aimed at curbing the administrative costs New France had accumulated. In addition, dwindling supply increased black market trading. A greater number of indigenous groups and fur traders began circumventing [[Montreal]] and New France altogether; many began trading with either [[United Kingdom|British]] or [[Netherlands|Dutch]] merchants to the south.<ref name = \"illegalfurtrade\"/>\n\nBy the end of French rule in New France in 1763, the fur trade had significantly lost its importance as the key stable good that supported much of New France's economy for more than the last century. Even so, it did serve as the fundamental force behind the establishment and vast growth of Montreal and the French colony.\n\n===Coureurs des bois and voyageurs===\n[[File:Arrival of Radisson in an Indian camp 1660 Charles William Jefferys.jpg|thumb|The arrival of [[Pierre-Esprit Radisson|Radisson]] in an Amerindian camp in 1660]]\nThe [[coureurs des bois]] were responsible for starting the flow of trade from [[Montreal]], carrying [[France|French]] goods into upper territories while indigenous people were bringing down their [[furs]]. The coureurs traveled with intermediate trading tribes, and found that they were anxious to prevent French access to the more distant fur-hunting tribes. Still, the coureurs kept thrusting outwards using the [[Ottawa River]] as their initial step upon the journey and keeping Montreal as their starting point.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/> The Ottawa River was significant because it offered a route that was practical for Europeans, by taking the traders northward out of the territory dominated by the [[Iroquois]]. It was for this reason that Montreal and the Ottawa River was a central location of indigenous warfare and rivalry.\n\nMontreal faced difficulties by having too many coureurs out in the woods. The furs coming down were causing an oversupply on the markets of [[Europe]]. This challenged the coureurs trade because they so easily evaded controls, monopolies, and taxation, and additionally because the coureurs trade was held to debauch both French and various indigenous groups. The coureur debauched Frenchmen by accustoming them to fully live with indigenous, and indigenous by trading on their desire for alcohol.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nThe issues caused a great rift in the [[colony]], and in 1678, it was confirmed by a General Assembly that the trade was to be made in public so as to better assure the safety of the indigenous population. It was also forbidden to take spirits inland to trade with indigenous groups. However these restrictions on the coureurs, for a variety of reasons, never worked. The [[fur trade]] remained dependent on spirits, and increasingly in the hands of the coureurs who journeyed north in search of furs.<ref name=\"Rich, E. E. 1966\"/>\n\nAs time passed, the Coureurs des bois were partially replaced by licensed fur trading endeavors, and the main canoe travel workers of those endeavors were called [[voyageurs]].\n\n===Indigenous peoples===\n[[File:Woodlands Shirt, c. 1720-1750.jpg|thumb|Leather Shirt, c. 1720-1750.

Made of antelope hide, the interlocking abstract painted designs probably represent the sacred [[Thunderbird (mythology)|Thunderbird]].]]\nThe [[French people|French]] were interested in exploiting the land through the fur trade as well as the timber trade later on. Despite having tools and guns, the French settlers were dependent on Indigenous people to survive in the difficult climate in this part of North America. Many settlers did not know how to survive through the winter; the Indigenous people showed them how to survive in the New World. They showed the settlers how to hunt for food and to use the furs for clothing that would protect them during the winter months.<ref>{{cite book |last=Friders |first=James S. |title=Native Peoples in Canada: Contemporary Conflicts |location=Scarborough: Ontario |publisher=Prentice-Hall Canada |date=1993 |isbn=978-0-1301-2204-9}}</ref>\n\nAs the fur trade became the dominant economy in the New World, French voyageurs, trappers and hunters often married or formed relationships with Indigenous women. This allowed the French to develop relations with their wives' Indigenous nations, which in turn provided protection and access to their hunting and trapping grounds.\n\nThe fur trade benefited Indigenous people as well. They traded furs for metal tools and other European made items that made their lives easier. Tools such as knives, pots and kettles, nets, firearms and hatchets improved the general welfare of indigenous peoples. At the same time, while everyday life became easier, some traditional ways of doing things were abandoned or altered, and while Indigenous people embraced many of these implements and tools, they also were exposed to less vital trade goods, such as alcohol and sugar, sometimes with deleterious effect.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Carlos |first1=Ann M. |last2=Lewis |first2=Frank D. |title=Commerce by Frozen Sea: Native Americans and the European Fur Trade |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |year=2010 |isbn=978-0812204827 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wjc34n1z8pYC&pg=PP1}}</ref>\n\n===Formal entry of England in New France area fur trade===\n[[File:Claude Bernou Carte de lAmerique septentrionale.jpg|thumb|1681 French map of the New World above the equator: New France and the [[Great Lakes]] in the north, with a dark line as the [[Mississippi River]] to the west in the [[Illinois Country]] and the mouth of the river (and future New Orleans) then ''[[terra incognita]]'']]\n\nSince [[Henry Hudson]] had claimed [[Hudson Bay]], and the surrounding lands for England in 1611, English colonists had begun expanding their boundaries across what is now the [[Canada|Canadian]] north beyond the French-held territory of New France.

Canada was divided into three districts: the district of Quebec City, the district of [[Trois-Rivi\u00e8res]], and the district of [[Montreal]].{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=247}} Each district had its own separate jurisdiction with a judge appointed by the Crown, known as the civil and criminal lieutenants general.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=247}} They were responsible for all legal matters, civil and criminal, in each of the districts.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=247}}\n\nIn addition to the royal judges, there were other judicial officers in each district.

The Sovereign Council effectively acted as the functional equivalent of a Council of State (''Conseil d'\u00c9tat'') for New France, having the authority to hand down verdicts on final appeal.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} Initially, the Council convened once every week, and the quorum of the Sovereign Council was seven for criminal matters, or five for civil cases.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} The Council's practices evolved over time.

All royal judges and king's attorneys in New France had to be thoroughly familiar with this compilation of rules.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=248}} The Custom governed various civil aspects of the daily life in New France, including property, marriage, inheritance, and so on.\n\n=====Montreal Island: transition from feudal justice to royal justice=====\nThe [[Island of Montreal]] was a special case because its judiciary had been previously held by the Society of St-Sulpice. In 1663, Governor-General of New France [[Augustin de Saffray de M\u00e9sy]] originally considered appointing [[Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve]] the Governor of the Island of Montreal and consolidating a royal jurisdiction on the island, but the plan garnered the [[Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice|St-Sulpicians]]' disapproval, who held the Island as its own [[fief]]dom and effectively acted as the island's governor.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=253}} In other words, the [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]] had not been able to seize effective control over the legal matters of the Island; instead, the [[Society of Priests of Saint Sulpice|St-Sulpicians]] administered justice on the island.\n\nIt was not until 16 September 1666, that the St-Sulpicians finally handed over the justice of the Island of Montreal to the Intendant of New France.{{sfnp|Lareau|1881|page=254}} In 1693, the French king commanded the replacement of the ecclesiastical courts in Montreal with a royal court composed of one royal judge, with appeals going to the [[Sovereign Council of New France|Sovereign Council]].

A small colonial force from Virginia began a fort here, but a French force under [[Claude-Pierre P\u00e9caudy de Contrec\u0153ur]] drove them off in April 1754. New France claimed this as part of their colony, and the French were anxious to keep the British from encroaching on it. The French built Fort Duquesne here to serve as a military stronghold and as a base for developing trade and strengthening military alliances with the indigenous peoples of the area.\n\nIn 1755, General [[Edward Braddock]] led [[Braddock Expedition|an expedition]] against Fort Duquesne, and although they were numerically superior to the French militia and their Indian allies, Braddock's army was routed and Braddock was killed.<ref name=\"WDL\">{{cite web |url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/9580/ |title=The Battle of the Monongahela |website=[[World Digital Library]] |date=1755 |accessdate=22 February 2016}}</ref> Later that same year at the Battle of Lake George, the British General William Johnson with a force of 1700 American and Iroquois troops defeated a French force of 2800 French and Canadians and 700 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] led by Baron Dieskau (Military commander of New France).\n\nThe fight for control over Ohio Country led to the [[French and Indian War]], which began as the North American phase of the [[Seven Years' War]] (which did not technically begin in Europe until 1756). The war began with the defeat of a Virginia militia contingent led by Colonel [[George Washington]] by the French [[troupes de la marine]] in the [[Ohio Country|Ohio valley]]. As a result of that defeat, the British decided to prepare the conquest of Quebec City, the capital of New France. The British defeated France in Acadia in the [[Battle of Fort Beausejour]] (1755) and then [[\u00cele Royale (New France)|\u00cele Royale]] ([[Cape Breton Island]]) (which also administered \u00cele Saint-Jean ([[Prince Edward Island]]) with the [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)]].\n\nThroughout the war, the British forcibly removed the Acadians from their lands, which the Mi'kmaq and Acadian militias resisted. The [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]] continued from 1755 to 1764.\n\nThese British military successes were resisted, with successes by the French and Native Americans. In 1756, a large force of French, Canadians, and their Native American allies led by Marquis de Montcalm launched an attack against the key British post at Fort Oswego on Lake Ontario from Fort Frontenac and forced the garrison to surrender. The following year Montcalm with a huge force of 7200 French and Canadians and 2400 Native Americans laid siege to Fort William Henry on the southern shores of Lake George, and after three weeks of fighting the British commander Monroe surrendered. Montcalm gave him honorable terms to return to England and not to fight for 18 months. But many of the Native Americans were hungry for scalps and loot, so when the British force with civilians were three miles from the fort they massacred about 1100 of the 1500 strong force.\n\nThe following year the French had one victory and one defeat. The defeat was at the French fortress city of Louisbourg. The victory was at the strip of land between Lake Champlain and Lake George at the French fortress of Fort Carillon. The British force sent to capture Fort Carillon (held by just 3400 French regulars and marines with almost no militia or indigenous support) was the largest ever seen in America at that time: 16,200 British, American, and Iroquois troops under the command of General James Abercrombie. This battle cost the British 2200 troops, several artillery pieces against French losses of around 200 killed or wounded.\n\nWhile the British [[Siege of Port Royal (1710)|Conquest of Acadia]] happened in 1710, the French continued to remain a significant force in the region with [[Fort Beausejour]] and [[Fortress Louisbourg]]. The dominant population in the region remained Acadian, that is to say, not British. In 1755, the British were successful in the [[Battle of Beausejour]] and immediately after began the [[expulsion of the Acadians]]. \n\nIn the meantime the French continued to explore westwards and expand their trade alliances with indigenous peoples. [[Fort de la Corne]] was built in 1753, by [[Louis de la Corne, Chevalier de la Corne]] just east of the [[Saskatchewan River Forks]] in what is today the Canadian province of [[Saskatchewan]]. This was the furthest westward outpost of the French Empire in North America to be established before its fall.\n\n==Treaties of cession==\n{{further|Conquest of New France (1758-1760)}}\nIn 1758, British forces again [[Siege of Louisbourg (1758)|captured Louisbourg]], allowing them to blockade the entrance to the St. Lawrence River. This proved decisive in the war. In 1759, the British besieged Quebec by sea, and an army under General [[James Wolfe]] defeated the French under General [[Louis-Joseph de Montcalm]] at the [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham]] in September. The garrison in Quebec surrendered on 18 September, and by the next year New France had been conquered by the British after [[Montreal Campaign|the attack on Montreal]], which had refused to acknowledge the fall of Canada. The last French governor-general of New France, [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil-Cavagnal]], surrendered to British Major General [[Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst|Jeffery Amherst]] on 8 September 1760.

The [[Louisiana Territory]], under [[Spain|Spanish]] control since the end of the Seven Years' War, remained off-limits to settlement from the thirteen American colonies.\n\nTwelve years after the British defeated the French, the [[American Revolutionary War]] broke out in the Thirteen Colonies. Many French Canadians would take part in the war, including Major [[Cl\u00e9ment Gosselin]] and Admiral [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil]]. After the British surrender at [[Battle of Yorktown (1781)|Yorktown]] in 1781, the [[Treaty of Versailles (1783)|Treaty of Versailles]] gave all former British claims in New France below the [[Great Lakes]] into the possession of the nascent [[United States]]. A Franco-Spanish alliance treaty returned Louisiana to France in 1801, but French leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] sold it to the United States in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] in 1803, ending French colonial efforts in North America.\n\nThe portions of the former New France that remained under British rule were administered as [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]], 1791\u20131841, and then those regions were merged as the [[Province of Canada]] during 1841\u20131867, when the passage of the [[Constitution Act, 1867|British North America Act of 1867]] instituted [[home rule]] for most of British North America and established French-speaking Quebec (the former Lower Canada) as one of the original provinces of the [[Confederation of Canada|Dominion of Canada]]. The former French colony of Acadia was first designated the [[Colony of Nova Scotia]] but shortly thereafter the [[Colony of New Brunswick]], which then included Prince Edward Island, was split off from it.\n\nIn Canada, the legacy of New France can be seen in the enduring [[Canadian identity#French Canadians and Identity in English Canada|Francophone identity]] of its descendants, which has led to [[Bilingualism in Canada|institutional bilingualism]] in Canada as a whole.\n\nThe only remnant of the former colonial territory of New France that remains under French control to this day is the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]] (French: Collectivit\u00e9 territoriale de Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon), consisting of a group of small islands {{convert|25|km|mi nmi}} off the coast of [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], Canada.\n\n==Political divisions of New France==\n[[File:Constitution-of-new-france-1759.png|thumb|A chart showing the political organization of New France, c. 1759]]\nThe territory of New France was divided into five colonies, each with its own administration: [[Canada (New France)|Canada]], Hudson's Bay, [[Acadia]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] [[Placentia, Newfoundland and Labrador|(Plaisance)]], and [[Louisiana (New France)|Louisiana]].<ref name=Francis2009 /><ref name=Territoire /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://slmc.uottawa.ca/?q=canada_new_france |title=Canada at the Time of New France  |date=2004  |author=University of Ottawa |accessdate= March 24, 2017}}</ref> The Treaty of Utrecht resulted in the relinquishing of French claims to mainland Acadia, the Hudson Bay and Newfoundland, and the establishment of the colony of [[Cape Breton Island|\u00cele Royale]], now called Cape Breton Island, where the French built the [[Fortress of Louisbourg]].<ref name=Johnston2001 /><ref name=Louisbourg /> Acadia had a difficult history, with the [[Expulsion of the Acadians|Great Upheaval]], remembered on [[Royal Proclamation of 2003|July 28]] each year since 2003.

Some Anglophone historians portray the Conquest as a victory for \"British military, political and economic superiority\" and argue that it ultimately brought benefits to the French settlers.<ref name=Jaenen/> However, Cornelius Jaenen notes that French-Canadian historians remain strongly divided on the subject. One group sees it as a highly negative economic, political and ideological disaster that threatened a way of life with materialism and Protestantism. At the other pole are those historians who see the positive benefit of enabling the preservation of language, and religion and traditional customs under British rule.<ref name=Jaenen>{{cite book |last=Jaenen |first=Cornelius J. |title=Canada during the French regime |editor-last=Muise |editor-first=D.A. |work=A Reader's Guide to Canadian History: Volume 1: Beginnings to Confederation |year=1982 |page=[https://archive.org/details/readersguidetoca0000unse/page/40 40] |isbn=978-0-8020-6442-4 |url=https://archive.org/details/readersguidetoca0000unse/page/40 }}</ref> French-Canadian debates have escalated since the 1960s, as the conquest is seen as a pivotal moment in the history of Qu\u00e9bec's nationalism.
