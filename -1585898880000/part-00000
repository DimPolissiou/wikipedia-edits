The show was a humorous presentation on the importance of the human brain.\n\nThe show's script was written by Jenny Tripp, a staff writer in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Feature Animation]], and directed by [[Jerry Rees]], who in addition to many other Disney film-based attractions, directed ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]''. The pre-show itself was the first directing effort of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], famous for later directing ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nIt premiered on October 19, 1989; as of January 4, 2004 it began to operate seasonally, closing permanently on January 1, 2007. During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.{{facts|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Preshow==\n[[File:Cranium Command (358808645).jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee featuring Buzzy (top) and General Knowledge (bottom).]] From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\">{{cite web|title=Cranium Command|url=http://www.yesterland.com/cranium.html|website=Yesterland}}</ref>\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge ([[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Corey Burton]])<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]|developer=Mindsai Productions|developer2=[[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]]|publisher=Disney Interactive|date=1996|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]]|version=1.0|scene=Cranium Command - Trivia slideshow|level= |language= |quote='''General Knowledge''': \"The voice of General Knowledge ''(begins to change to Burton's natural voice)'' was played by Corey Burton.\" / '''Burton''': \"''(chuckles)'' That's me.\"}}</ref> briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of [[Albert Einstein]], as the example of a person who used his brain and [[Ernest P. Worrell]] (a popular fictional character played by [[Jim Varney]], who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"''Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!'' Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\n==Show==\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an [[Audio-Animatronic]] on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain ([[Charles Grodin]]), the wacky Right Brain ([[Jon Lovitz]]), the hungry Stomach ([[George Wendt]]), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" ([[Jeff Doucette]], in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles ([[Dana Carvey]] and [[Kevin Nealon]], reprising their [[Hans and Franz]] roles from [[Saturday Night Live]]). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by [[Kirk Wise]]), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by [[Natalie Gregory]]), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a [[food fight]] at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/>\n\n==Orgins==\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer [[Rolly Crump]], the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to [[emotion]], [[intellect]] and [[the nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|title=The Wonders of the Wonders of Life|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/07/31/the-wonders-of-the-wonders-of-life/|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion and the [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] finally secured [[MetLife]] to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"[[Wonders of Life]]\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 [[Walt Disney]]-produced animated propaganda film [[Reason and Emotion]], they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the [[Star Trek]] franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the [[Starship Enterprise]]. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a [[Mr. Spock]] type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.<ref name=\"Steve Kirk\">WDW Radio interview with Steve Kirk http://www.wdwradio.com/2008/02/interview-with-former-disney-imagineer-steve-kirk/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Ride Through the Human Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cranium+command+captain+cortex&source=bl&ots=ndKiBE7aC2&sig=Ga3ewuo3N1TaW78Dy-5kkABfEMc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI3dG-wq_MAhVMRiYKHR_ZBxIQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to [[Colossal Pictures]], who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"[[Magic Journeys]]\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted.  Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending.  No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance.  And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story,  their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"<ref name=\"Steve Moore\">{{cite web |url= http://flipanimation.blogspot.com/2013/08/remembering-epcots-cranium-command-both.html|title= Remembering EPCOT's Cranium Command - Both Versions|last= Moore|first= Steve|date= August 28, 2013|website= Flip Animation blog|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], (at the time) president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Marty Sklar]] and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\">{{cite web |url= http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-making-of-cranium-command.html|title= The Making of Cranium Command|last= |first= |date= |website= The Disney Project|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> \n\n===Animation===\nRees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Tom Sito]]. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on [[R. Lee Ermey]]'s character from ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. [[Rob Minkoff]] was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the [[Roger Rabbit]] short \"[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.<ref name=\"Steve Moore\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nWhile work on the animation commenced at the newly built animation wing at [[Disney-MGM Studios]], Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: \u201cEverything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut [[point-of-view shot]]s which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears,{{clarify|date=April 2016}} he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\n===Programming the Animatronics===\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\"/> For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\n===Music===\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] starring [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Robin Williams]]) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple [[leitmotifs]] more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.<ref name=\"Tammy Tucker\">The Tiara Talk Show: Interview with David Newman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDqnqA2Wsc</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Wonders of Life Cranium Command Entrance.jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee formerly stood behind where a seminar stage stands now.]]''Cranium Command'''s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride [[Body Wars]]. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\"<ref name=\"Bob Sehlinger\">Touring Plans -- Cranium Command Unofficial Guide historical reference entry https://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/cranium-command#</ref> It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/> Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\"/>\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remainseatedplease.com/2015/throwback-thursday-cranium-command-at-epcot/ |title= Throwback Thursday - Cranium Command at EPCOT!|author=David|date= March 12, 2015|website= Remain Seated Please|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.<ref name=>{{cite web |url=http://vinylmationkingdom.com/2014/07/22/vinylmation-park-series-14-twin-pack-cranium-command-details/ |title=Vinylmation Park Series 14 Twin Pack Cranium Command Details |author=rogpalmeruk |date= July 22, 2014|website= VinylMation Kingdom|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}} </ref>\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.<ref name=\"Unknown admin\">Lost Epcot \"Cranium Command\" photos http://www.lostepcot.com/craniumcommand.html</ref>\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], who were major players on turning the troubled ''Cranium Command'' project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which ''Beast'' desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making ''Beauty and the Beast'' one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">Looking Back on \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- Part II http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/06/09/188.aspx</ref>\n\nAnother connection was that [[Pete Docter]] wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at [[Pixar]]. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.<ref name=\"Drew Taylor\">Oh My Disney \"Go Inside Pete Docter's Mind\" article https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/06/16/go-inside-pete-docters-mind-5-disney-classics-that-inspired-inside-out/</ref>\n\nThe Disney short ''Inner Workings'', which debuted with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' also shares similar themes. Directed by Leo Matsuda, the short \"is the story of the internal struggle between a man\u2019s Brain\u2014a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart\u2014a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.\" ''Cranium Command'', along with the [[World War II]] propaganda short ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' is cited as one of the main inspirations for the short.<ref name=\"Angie Han\">/Film article \"Disney\u2019s Next Short Film \u2018Inner Workings\u2019 to Debut at Annecy; Will Play With \u2018Moana\u2019\" http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-inner-workings-short/</ref>\n\n==Status after ride closure==\nAfter shutting down in 2007, the attraction was left intact but closed to public access. In 2017, Matt Sonswa, an urban explorer, posted an exploration video on YouTube of the show building showing the pre-show, theater, and animatronics to be in good condition. A number of animatronic elements including Buzzy were marked by the Walt Disney archives for preservation.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sonswa |first1=Matt |title=Disney Cranium Command Epcot |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrOPmotqGCY&t |website=YouTube |publisher=MattSonswa |accessdate= 3 February 2019}}</ref> Cranium Command subsequently became an increasingly popular destination for urban explorers.\n\nOn February 21, 2019, Disney announced that the Wonders of Life pavilion, including the Cranium Command show building, will be repurposed as a new pavilion entitled [[Play!]].

The show was a humorous presentation on the importance of the human brain.\n\nThe show's script was written by Jenny Tripp, a staff writer in [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney Feature Animation]], and directed by [[Jerry Rees]], who in addition to many other Disney film-based attractions, directed ''[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]''. The pre-show itself was the first directing effort of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], famous for later directing ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' and ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]''.\n\nIt premiered on October 19, 1989; as of January 4, 2004 it began to operate seasonally, closing permanently on January 1, 2007. During the 2007 International Food & Wine Festival, the entrance was used as a wine presentation. The pavilion has continued to be used for various Epcot festival events.{{facts|date=July 2019}}\n\n==Preshow==\n[[File:Cranium Command (358808645).jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee featuring Buzzy (top) and General Knowledge (bottom).]] From the entrance at the back of the pavilion, guests walked into a very basic, sparsely themed holding room with a digital counter reading the time until the next show. On the walls hung propaganda posters encouraging guests to enlist in the \"Cranium Command\" (similar signage could be seen advertising the show around the Wonders of Life pavilion). Also there was signage including brain teasers and humorous gags and puns, setting the stage for both the concept and tone. Guests were then led into a narrow, tall room with brightly colored carpeted walls. Facing the guests was a plain movie screen, and closed automatic doors to their left.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\">{{cite web|title=Cranium Command|url=http://www.yesterland.com/cranium.html|website=Yesterland}}</ref>\n\nThe movie screen would soon illuminate showing an animated segment featuring the boisterous and loud General Knowledge ([[voice actor|voiced]] by [[Corey Burton]])<ref>{{cite video game|title=[[The Walt Disney World Explorer]]|developer=Mindsai Productions|developer2=[[Disney Interactive Studios|Disney Interactive]]|publisher=Disney Interactive|date=1996|platform=[[Microsoft Windows]], [[Classic Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]]|version=1.0|scene=Cranium Command - Trivia slideshow|level= |language= |quote='''General Knowledge''': \"The voice of General Knowledge ''(begins to change to Burton's natural voice)'' was played by Corey Burton.\" / '''Burton''': \"''(chuckles)'' That's me.\"}}</ref> briefing his \"Cranium Commando\" troops on their mission: to pilot human brains and keep the people they're in out of trouble. A bumbling little soldier named Buzzy (Scott Curtis) had been given one of the most difficult missions of all: piloting a twelve-year-old boy.\n\nWhen General Knowledge spoke in the pre-show and was explaining that they were different kinds of brains, he showed a picture of [[Albert Einstein]], as the example of a person who used his brain and [[Ernest P. Worrell]] (a popular fictional character played by [[Jim Varney]], who was appearing in series of feature films produced by Disney at the time), as an example of the opposite. At the end of the preshow, General Knowledge asked the guests, \"''Hey, you Goldbricks! This ain't no Spectator Sport! Where do you think you are, Disney World?!'' Get your strollers in line and hustle!\", pointing towards the theater as the automatic doors swung open.\n\n==Show==\nThe main show was presented in a 200-seat, dimly-lit theater designed to represent the inside of a human head; the outside world seen on video displays where the eyes would be. Buzzy was now presented as an [[Audio-Animatronic]] on an articulated seat so that he could move around during the performance. Helping him pilot the twelve-year-old named Bobby (also acted by Scott Curtis), via appearances on other video screens, were the logical Left Brain ([[Charles Grodin]]), the wacky Right Brain ([[Jon Lovitz]]), the hungry Stomach ([[George Wendt]]), the panicky Bladder who is also referred to as \"Elimination\" ([[Jeff Doucette]], in an uncredited role), the Adrenal Gland ([[Bobcat Goldthwait]]) who was prone to overreacting, and the heart's Right and Left Ventricles ([[Dana Carvey]] and [[Kevin Nealon]], reprising their [[Hans and Franz]] roles from [[Saturday Night Live]]). The monotone Hypothalamus (voiced by [[Kirk Wise]]), which regulated autonomic bodily functions, was represented via Audio-Animatronics as a robot.\n\nThe show took Buzzy's host through a typical day: getting up, skipping breakfast, running to school after missing the bus, meeting and falling for a cute new girl (Annie, played by [[Natalie Gregory]]), protecting her from bullies, getting involved in a [[food fight]] at lunch, getting sent to the principal (Kenneth Kimmins), and being thanked by the girl, then kissed after asking her out. At each point in the day, the various organs of the body talked to Buzzy, explained the problems they were facing, and in many cases argued over how Buzzy should deal with the situation. In the end, Buzzy (via help of General Knowledge's advice) eventually learned how to effectively balance the needs of his body crew in order to combat potential stressful situations.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/>\n\n==Orgins==\nThe attraction was the only fully surviving element from the original 1978 plans for EPCOT Center's \"Life and Health\" pavilion. Titled \"The Head Trip\", it was to share a theatre space with a dentistry-themed show called \"Tooth Follies\". Designed by legendary Imagineer [[Rolly Crump]], the stage and concept would be similar to the final incarnation, but with three animatronics dedicated to [[emotion]], [[intellect]] and [[the nervous system]].<ref>{{cite web|website=Oh My Disney|title=The Wonders of the Wonders of Life|url=https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/07/31/the-wonders-of-the-wonders-of-life/|date=July 31, 2015}}</ref> When Disney was unable to find a sponsor to host the pavilion, the construction of Life and Health was delayed indefinitely. However, an expansion pad between the [[Universe of Energy]] pavilion and the [[Horizons (Epcot)|Horizons]] pavilion was kept as Disney still planned to build it.\n\nIn the mid-1980s, then Disney CEO [[Michael Eisner]] finally secured [[MetLife]] to sponsor the Life and Health pavilion, now renamed \"[[Wonders of Life]]\" and restarted development. Imagineer Steve Kirk replaced Crump on the project, and worked with Barry Braveman to flesh out the idea of \"The Head Trip\" into its own full attraction. Partially inspired by the 1943 [[Walt Disney]]-produced animated propaganda film [[Reason and Emotion]], they explored the idea of transforming the concept into a parody of the [[Star Trek]] franchise. The human head was to be represented as a bridge on a spaceship much like the [[Starship Enterprise]]. Kirk explains: \"...there was one character with a supporting cast on film for different parts of the body. Originally there was a captain, a [[Mr. Spock]] type, several ensigns at each of the senses, there was an officer for reason, there was an officer for emotion... so there was a little cast of these little characters about, maybe, 2 feet tall in this pretty big theatre that was a pretty involved bridge of a ship, which was, again, inside the human head.\" Eventually, the budget was reduced to only be able to include one audio-animatronic figure and a robot, eventually becoming the Hypothalamus. Kirk hoped that the show would have been reprogrammed over the years to include different versions of the show in order to discuss a variety of health-related topics, but that idea never came to be.<ref name=\"Steve Kirk\">WDW Radio interview with Steve Kirk http://www.wdwradio.com/2008/02/interview-with-former-disney-imagineer-steve-kirk/</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWith the budget reduction also came a new take on the concept along with its final name. Now titled \"Cranium Command\", the show featured a military theme wherein \"brain pilots\" take control of a mechanized human head. The main audio-animatronic character was dubbed \"Captain Cortex\"<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=Popular Mechanics|title=Ride Through the Human Body|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G-MDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=cranium+command+captain+cortex&source=bl&ots=ndKiBE7aC2&sig=Ga3ewuo3N1TaW78Dy-5kkABfEMc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjI3dG-wq_MAhVMRiYKHR_ZBxIQ6AEITzAL#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> and ran the body, now that of a young boy, much like one would a military craft. He reports under his commanding officer \"General Knowledge\", who lectured the audience during the pre-show and then to Cortex in the main show. With time and resources running low, Imagineering outsourced production of the animated and live-action film portions to [[Colossal Pictures]], who had previously worked with them on the 3D show \"[[Magic Journeys]]\". However, halfway into production Disney executives killed this version of the project to have it retooled by their own Feature Animation department. Animator Steve Moore, who worked on both versions, recalled, \"They were doing more of a Fred Crippen, Roger Ramjet style, which was fun, but not winning points with the clients. Storytelling was Colossal's Achilles heel ...they took the story given to them by Imagineering and followed it, thinking they were giving their client what they wanted.  Unfortunately, it was written like an educational film from the '40s - very dry and condescending.  No amount of style could make up for the lack of substance.  And even though Colossal was executing Imagineering's story,  their inability to interpret the story into something workable sunk them.\"<ref name=\"Steve Moore\">{{cite web |url= http://flipanimation.blogspot.com/2013/08/remembering-epcots-cranium-command-both.html|title= Remembering EPCOT's Cranium Command - Both Versions|last= Moore|first= Steve|date= August 28, 2013|website= Flip Animation blog|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn May 1989, director Jerry Rees was approached by [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]], (at the time) president of [[Walt Disney Feature Animation]], to speak with several Disney brass members including Eisner, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]], [[Marty Sklar]] and Tom Fitzgerald. They all unanimously loathed Colossal Pictures' take on \"Cranium Command\" and sought him out to fix it. After a brief review, Rees cited the various issues and recommended that the project be rewritten from scratch. The executives gave Rees full creative freedom aside from needing to keep General Knowledge and the overall stress-management theme, per the sponsor's request. Unfortunately they only had five months to complete the project, as they had to reach the October deadline.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\">{{cite web |url= http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-making-of-cranium-command.html|title= The Making of Cranium Command|last= |first= |date= |website= The Disney Project|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> \n\n===Animation===\nRees rounded up as many animators from Feature Animation as he could, including [[Gary Trousdale]], [[Kirk Wise]] and [[Tom Sito]]. The latter three along with Rees crafted an entirely new storyline in under a week with Jenny Tripp penning the script. One of the largest changes was the personality of General Knowledge, now based on [[R. Lee Ermey]]'s character from ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]''. Per Wise, \"We thought it would be funny if the character who was supposed to teach you how to manage your stress screamed at you incessantly like a psychotic drill sergeant.\" They also changed the pilot's name from Captain Cortex to Buzzy, a bumbling young recruit. [[Rob Minkoff]] was slated to direct the animated preshow as Rees needed to focus on the live-action heavy main show, but dropped out to take over the [[Roger Rabbit]] short \"[[Roller Coaster Rabbit]]\". Schneider desperately asked the unproven Trousdale and Wise duo to step in as directors. Wise claims, \"Saying \"yes\" turned out to be the smartest thing Gary and I ever did.\" In addition, the pre-show of \"Cranium Command\" was the very last project at Disney Feature Animation to be traditionally inked and painted on cels.<ref name=\"Steve Moore\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nWhile work on the animation commenced at the newly built animation wing at [[Disney-MGM Studios]], Rees flew to Los Angeles to begin filming the live-action main show elements. Eventually he would end up directing nearly all of the show elements, per him: \u201cEverything that you see and hear from the 8 screens, 2 Audio-Animatronic figures, and the 10 discreet channels of sound.\" The complexity of creating the seemingly uncut [[point-of-view shot]]s which had to interact with several other pieces of media was a \"wild\" task for the ambitious director. Without optical or digital assistance, he used camera tricks and matching blur frames to stitch together the POV footage to seem like one continuous shot. In addition, Rees took the cinematographer and camera operators to the filming locations prior to shooting. When there, they would do tests to figure out how to make the camera express behavior and emotion such as shyness, love, anger, fear, panic and worry. This was essential to the intended immersion that you were inside a boy's head, looking out his eyes as he experienced life and reacted to it.\n\nAfter the POV filming was complete, Rees took to a soundstage to film the live-action scenes involving the \"body crew\". Wanting to turn audience members' expectations on their ears,{{clarify|date=April 2016}} he cast various famous comedians of the time to play the roles in zany sets.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} The project's complexities continued to dominate, as Rees had to put one eye on the filming and one eye on a monitor playing the POV video in order to cue up the footage accordingly. Finally, he reached post-production by first mocking the eight screens of the theatre in Los Angeles and editing all the various film items together along with the animatronic dialogue, which bewildered executives such as Katzenberg when reviewing the production.\n\n===Programming the Animatronics===\nOnce editing was complete, Rees came back to Orlando and spent the remaining time with Imagineering in the finished theatre putting all the pieces together. While Rees himself articulated the audio-animatronic of Buzzy, animator Rebecca Rees (Jerry's wife) took control of the live-animation of the droning Hypothalamus robot, as she was the one who came up with the idea behind the character. In an uncredited role, Kirk Wise voiced the Hypothalamus.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck\"/> For the animation of the Buzzy animatronic, Rees used the concept of the articulated arm the character sits on to create the illusion of centrifugal force. For example, when the boy's head turned right (simulated through the POV eye footage), Buzzy's platform and chair would swing to the left. This was yet another device to immerse the audience into the experience to feel like they were riding inside a human head even though the bench seating in the theatre did not move.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\">The Disney Project podcast episode 8 \"Welcome to Jerry Rees Month\" http://www.thedisneyproject.com/2013/06/the-disney-project-podcast-episode-8.html</ref>\n===Music===\nComposer David Newman, who had previously worked with Rees on \"[[The Brave Little Toaster (film)|The Brave Little Toaster]]\" and \"Back to Neverland\" (a short about animation at [[Disney-MGM Studios]] starring [[Walter Cronkite]] and [[Robin Williams]]) wrote the show's music score. The pre-show's score evokes the tone of military marching music, but becomes more orchestral in the main show. Unlike most music created for theme park attractions, there are multiple [[leitmotifs]] more in common with a fuller film score. In an interview, Newman briefly cited that it was a lot of fun, much like his other projects with Rees.<ref name=\"Tammy Tucker\">The Tiara Talk Show: Interview with David Newman https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZXDqnqA2Wsc</ref>\n\n==Reception and legacy==\n[[File:Wonders of Life Cranium Command Entrance.jpg|thumb|The attraction marquee formerly stood behind where a seminar stage stands now.]]''Cranium Command'''s opening was largely overshadowed by its sister attraction in Wonders of Life, the flight simulator thrill ride [[Body Wars]]. (Epcot's first) It also happened to have a poor location, tucked away in the back obscured by many other exhibits. Still, the attraction was regarded then and for almost the entire pavilion's lifespan as its \"hidden gem\" for its wit, charm, self-aware humor and fast-paced nature. The \"Unofficial Guide to Walt Disney World\" book series even termed the attraction as \"Epcot's hidden gem\", stating \"Epcot and Walt Disney World could use a lot more of this type of humor.\"<ref name=\"Bob Sehlinger\">Touring Plans -- Cranium Command Unofficial Guide historical reference entry https://touringplans.com/epcot/attractions/cranium-command#</ref> It remains beloved by many Disney fans a decade after its closure.<ref name=\"Werner Weiss\"/> Jerry Rees even stated that out of the record-setting 13 theme park attractions he helmed for Disney, Cranium Command was at the top of the list of the ones he most loved working on, so much so that for years afterward he unsuccessfully tried to get a feature film made shot entirely from a man's point-of-view.<ref name=\"Keith Gluck  /\"/>\n\nA \"Cranium Command\" trading pin featuring Buzzy was released in 2012 in tribute of Epcot's 30th anniversary<ref>{{cite web |url=http://remainseatedplease.com/2015/throwback-thursday-cranium-command-at-epcot/ |title= Throwback Thursday - Cranium Command at EPCOT!|first=David|date= March 12, 2015|website= Remain Seated Please|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref> and a Vinylmation twin pack featuring Buzzy and General Knowledge was released in 2014.<ref name=>{{cite web |url=http://vinylmationkingdom.com/2014/07/22/vinylmation-park-series-14-twin-pack-cranium-command-details/ |title=Vinylmation Park Series 14 Twin Pack Cranium Command Details |author=rogpalmeruk |date= July 22, 2014|website= VinylMation Kingdom|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}} </ref>\n\nThe attraction never changed over the course of its 17-year lifespan, aside from the entrance marquee. Upon opening, the entrance advertised the famous live-action comedians featured in the show but did not stick out much. In the mid-90s, it was remodeled to a much more theatrical appearance, focusing more on the militaristic and animated portions of the show, proudly featuring General Knowledge and Buzzy.<ref name=\"Unknown admin\">Lost Epcot \"Cranium Command\" photos http://www.lostepcot.com/craniumcommand.html</ref>\n\nThe show has a number of ties to important Disney history as well. At the grand opening, [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] was so impressed by the pre-show that he claimed it was almost more entertaining than the main show itself. When he got back to Glendale, he found himself needing to assign a new director to ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' after firing Richard Purdum from the project due to creative differences. Immediately he thought of [[Gary Trousdale]] and [[Kirk Wise]], who were major players on turning the troubled ''Cranium Command'' project around in record time, and giving it a great sense of humor which ''Beast'' desperately needed at the moment. Katzenberg quickly hired the duo who in turn ended up making ''Beauty and the Beast'' one of the most critically acclaimed animated films of all-time, and one of Disney's largest hits.<ref name=\"Jim Hill\">Looking Back on \"Beauty and the Beast\" -- Part II http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2004/06/09/188.aspx</ref>\n\nAnother connection was that [[Pete Docter]] wound up as an animator on the project (one of his first jobs), who would later become a director at [[Pixar]]. Coincidentally, Docter's third feature ''[[Inside Out (2015 film)|Inside Out]]'' had a very similar premise (exploring the mind of an 11-year-old girl) and he admitted the attraction played a part inspiring its development.<ref name=\"Drew Taylor\">Oh My Disney \"Go Inside Pete Docter's Mind\" article https://ohmy.disney.com/insider/2015/06/16/go-inside-pete-docters-mind-5-disney-classics-that-inspired-inside-out/</ref>\n\nThe Disney short ''Inner Workings'', which debuted with [[Walt Disney Animation Studios]]' ''[[Moana (2016 film)|Moana]]'' also shares similar themes. Directed by Leo Matsuda, the short \"is the story of the internal struggle between a man\u2019s Brain\u2014a pragmatic protector who calculates his every move, and his Heart\u2014a free-spirited adventurer who wants to let loose.\" ''Cranium Command'', along with the [[World War II]] propaganda short ''[[Reason and Emotion]]'' is cited as one of the main inspirations for the short.<ref name=\"Angie Han\">/Film article \"Disney\u2019s Next Short Film \u2018Inner Workings\u2019 to Debut at Annecy; Will Play With \u2018Moana\u2019\" http://www.slashfilm.com/disney-inner-workings-short/</ref>\n\n==Status after ride closure==\nAfter shutting down in 2007, the attraction was left intact but closed to public access.

Although there were many [[Muslim]]s among meyhane attendants, the authorities could, at times, prosecute them.{{Original research inline|date=July 2014}} With the relatively liberal atmosphere of the [[Tanzimat]] period (1839\u20131876), meyhane attendance among Muslims rose considerably, and raki became a favorite among [[meyhane]]-goers. By the end of the century, raki took its current standard form and its consumption surpassed that of [[wine]].\n\nDuring this period, rak\u0131 was produced by distillation of grapes [[pomace]] (''cibre'') obtained during wine fermentation. When the amount of pomace was not sufficient, alcohol imported from Europe would be added. If aniseed was not added, it would take the name ''d\u00fcz rak\u0131'' (\"straight rak\u0131\"), whereas rak\u0131 prepared with the addition of [[Mastic (plant resin)|gum mastic]] was named ''sak\u0131z rak\u0131s\u0131'' (gum rak\u0131) or ''mastikha''.\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the establishment of the modern-day [[Republic of Turkey]], grape-based rak\u0131 began to be distilled by the state-owned spirits monopoly [[Tekel]], with the first factory production taking place in 1944 in [[Izmir]]. With increasing [[sugar beet]] production, Tekel also began to distill the alcohol from [[molasses]], and a new brand of raki made from sugar-beet alcohol was introduced under the name ''Yeni Rak\u0131'' (\"New Rak\u0131\"). Molasses gave ''Yeni Rak\u0131'' a distinctive bitter taste and helped increase the drink's popularity.\n\nToday, with increased competition from the private sector, and the privatization of Tekel in 2004, several new brands and types of raki have emerged, each with its own distinct composition and production method, although the overall qualities of the drink have generally been kept consistent. These include ''Efe Rak\u0131'', ''\u00c7ilingir Rak\u0131'', ''Mercan Rak\u0131'', ''Fas\u0131l Rak\u0131'', ''Burgaz Rak\u0131'', ''Ata Rak\u0131'', and ''Anadolu Rak\u0131''. ''Sar\u0131 Zeybek Rak\u0131s\u0131'', another recent brand, is aged in [[oak]] [[ageing barrel|casks]], which gives it a distinctive golden colour.\n\n== Production ==\nRaki is traditionally produced from raisin/grape spirit called ''suma'' that is distilled to a maximum of 94.55% abv, This spirit is not highly rectified spirit and unlike other flavored spirits Raki producers consider that the ''suma'' has an important role to play in the flavor of Raki itself.\n\nThe ''suma'', or ''suma'' mixed with highly rectified spirit, is diluted with water re-distilled with aniseed and the spirit is collected at around 79-80% ''abv''. The flavored distillate is diluted and sweetened and rested for minimum of 30 days prior to sale in order to allow the flavors to harmonize.\n\n== Serving and drinking ==\n[[File:Rak\u0131 toasting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Toasting with rak\u0131, in typical rak\u0131 glasses]]\nIn [[Turkey]], rak\u0131 is the  national drink and is traditionally consumed with chilled water on the side or partly mixed with chilled water, according to personal preference. Rak\u0131 is rarely consumed without the addition of water. Ice cubes are often added. Dilution with water causes rak\u0131 to turn a milky-white colour, similar to the [[Ouzo effect|louche]] of [[absinthe]]. This phenomenon has resulted in the drink being popularly referred to ''aslan s\u00fct\u00fc'' (\"lion's milk\").<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Get Cooking, Fine Living Fans!|url=http://www.fineliving.com/fine/thirsty_traveler/episode/0,1663,FINE_10176_43295,00.html|publisher=Cooking channel|date=|accessdate=2011-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912011414/http://www.fineliving.com/fine/thirsty_traveler/episode/0,1663,FINE_10176_43295,00.html |archive-date=2009-09-12}}</ref> Since ''aslan'' (\"lion\") is a Turkish colloquial metaphor for a strong, courageous man, this gives the term a meaning close to \"the milk for the strong\".\n\nRak\u0131 is commonly consumed alongside [[meze]], a selection of hot and cold appetizers, as well as at a ''rak\u0131 sofras\u0131'' (\"rak\u0131 table\"), either before a full dinner or instead of it. It is especially popular with seafood, together with fresh [[arugula]], [[beyaz peynir]] and melon. It is an equally popular complement to various red meat dishes like [[kebab]]s, where it is sometimes served with a glass of [[\u015falgam]].\n\nThe founder and first President of the [[Republic of Turkey]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], was very fond of rak\u0131, and his late-night ''rak\u0131 sofras\u0131'' sessions were his favorite place to debate issues with his closest friends and advisors.<ref>G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston, Bruce Alan Masters, ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'', 2008, {{ISBN|0-8160-6259-5}}, p. 60</ref><ref>Geoffrey L. Lewis, ''The Turkish language reform: a catastrophic success'', 1999, {{ISBN|0-19-823856-8}}, p. 42</ref>\n\n== Types and brands ==\n[[File:Kreta Raki PL.JPG|thumb|150px|left|A bottle of Greek ''Rak\u0131''.]]\nStandard rak\u0131 is a [[grape]] product, though it may be produced from [[ficus|fig]]s as well. Rak\u0131 produced from figs, particularly popular in the southern provinces of Turkey, is called ''incir bo\u011fmas\u0131'', ''incir rak\u0131s\u0131'' (\"fig rak\u0131\"), or in Arabic, ''tini''. Tekel ceased producing fig rak\u0131 in 1947.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThere are two methods of Turkish rak\u0131 production. One method uses raisins and other grapes. ''Yeni Rak\u0131'' is produced from raisins and ''Tekirda\u011f Rak\u0131s\u0131'' is produced from grapes. Fresh grape rak\u0131 is like [[ouzo]] but has a higher alcohol content.\n\nSuma rak\u0131, i.e. distilled rak\u0131 prior to the addition of aniseed, is generally produced from [[raisins]] but raki factories around established wine-producing areas like [[Tekirda\u011f]], [[Nev\u015fehir]], and [[\u0130zmir]] may also use fresh grapes for higher quality. Recently, ''ya\u015f \u00fcz\u00fcm rak\u0131s\u0131'' (\"fresh-grape raki\") has become more popular in Turkey. The maker of a recent brand, ''Efe Rak\u0131'', was the first company to produce raki exclusively of fresh grape suma, called ''Efe Ya\u015f \u00dcz\u00fcm Rak\u0131s\u0131'' (Efe Fresh Grape Raki). ''Tekirda\u011f Alt\u0131n Seri'' (Tekirda\u011f Golden Series) followed the trend and many others have been produced by other companies.\n\nThe best-known and popular brands of rak\u0131, however, remain ''Yeni Rak\u0131'', originally produced by Tekel, which transferred production rights to Mey Alkol upon the 2004 privatization of Tekel, and ''Tekirda\u011f Rak\u0131s\u0131'' from the region of [[Tekirda\u011f]], which is famous for its characteristic flavour, believed to be due to the [[wikt:artesian|artesian]] waters of [[\u00c7orlu]] used in its production. ''Yeni Rak\u0131'' has an [[ethanol|alcohol]] content of 45% and 1.5 [[gram]]s of aniseed per [[litre|liter]]; ''Tekirda\u011f Rak\u0131s\u0131'' is 45% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] and has 1.7&nbsp;grams of aniseed per liter. There are also two top-quality brands called ''Kul\u00fcp Rak\u0131s\u0131'' and ''Alt\u0131nba\u015f'', each with 50% ABV.\n\n''Dip rak\u0131s\u0131'' (\"bottom rak\u0131\") is the rak\u0131 that remains in the bottom of the tanks during production. Bottom rak\u0131 is thought to best capture the dense aroma and flavour of the spirit, and is also called ''\u00f6zel rak\u0131'' (\"special raki\"). It is not generally available commercially; instead, rak\u0131 factories reserve it as a prestigious gift for large clients.\n\n==Events==\nAniseed-flavoured Rak\u0131, has been celebrated as a festival in [[Adana]] and [[Northern Cyprus]] since 2010. [[World Rak\u0131 Festival]] in Adana, emerged from a hundred-year tradition of enjoying [[Adana kebab]], with liver, [[\u015falgam]] and rak\u0131. The event turned into a nationwide popular street festival, street musicians playing drums and [[zurna]], entertain visitors all night long at the second Saturday night of every December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/haber/turkiye/rakicilar-bir-kez-daha-dunya-raki-gunune-hazirlaniyor|title=Rak\u0131c\u0131lar bir kez daha \"D\u00fcnya Rak\u0131 G\u00fcn\u00fc\"nde bulu\u015fuyor|website=CNN T\u00fcrk |language=tr |date=27 November 2014}}</ref> '''North Cyprus Rak\u0131 Festival''' is a week long festival taking place in  [[Girne]], [[Lefko\u015fa]] and [[Gazi Ma\u011fusa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kibrisrakifestivali.com/hakkinda.html|title=K\u0131br\u0131s Rak\u0131 Festivali|website=www.kibrisrakifestivali.com |language=tr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823184555/http://www.kibrisrakifestivali.com/hakkinda.html |archive-date=2018-08-23}}</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\nIn [[Crete]] ''[[tsikoudia]]'' is a [[pomace brandy]] that is sometimes called ''rak\u0131'' but made from grapes.

Although there were many [[Muslim]]s among meyhane attendants, the authorities could, at times, prosecute them.{{Original research inline|date=July 2014}} With the relatively liberal atmosphere of the [[Tanzimat]] period (1839\u20131876), meyhane attendance among Muslims rose considerably, and raki became a favorite among [[meyhane]]-goers. By the end of the century, raki took its current standard form and its consumption surpassed that of [[wine]].\n\nDuring this period, rak\u0131 was produced by distillation of grapes [[pomace]] (''cibre'') obtained during wine fermentation. When the amount of pomace was not sufficient, alcohol imported from Europe would be added. If aniseed was not added, it would take the name ''d\u00fcz rak\u0131'' (\"straight rak\u0131\"), whereas rak\u0131 prepared with the addition of [[Mastic (plant resin)|gum mastic]] was named ''sak\u0131z rak\u0131s\u0131'' (gum rak\u0131) or ''mastikha''.\n\nWith the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the establishment of the modern-day [[Republic of Turkey]], grape-based rak\u0131 began to be distilled by the state-owned spirits monopoly [[Tekel]], with the first factory production taking place in 1944 in [[Izmir]]. With increasing [[sugar beet]] production, Tekel also began to distill the alcohol from [[molasses]], and a new brand of raki made from sugar-beet alcohol was introduced under the name ''Yeni Rak\u0131'' (\"New Rak\u0131\"). Molasses gave ''Yeni Rak\u0131'' a distinctive bitter taste and helped increase the drink's popularity.\n\nToday, with increased competition from the private sector, and the privatization of Tekel in 2004, several new brands and types of raki have emerged, each with its own distinct composition and production method, although the overall qualities of the drink have generally been kept consistent. These include ''Efe Rak\u0131'', ''\u00c7ilingir Rak\u0131'', ''Mercan Rak\u0131'', ''Fas\u0131l Rak\u0131'', ''Burgaz Rak\u0131'', ''Ata Rak\u0131'', and ''Anadolu Rak\u0131''. ''Sar\u0131 Zeybek Rak\u0131s\u0131'', another recent brand, is aged in [[oak]] [[ageing barrel|casks]], which gives it a distinctive golden colour.\n\n== Production ==\nRaki is traditionally produced from raisin/grape spirit called ''suma'' that is distilled to a maximum of 94.55% abv, This spirit is not highly rectified spirit and unlike other flavored spirits Raki producers consider that the ''suma'' has an important role to play in the flavor of Raki itself.\n\nThe ''suma'', or ''suma'' mixed with highly rectified spirit, is diluted with water re-distilled with aniseed and the spirit is collected at around 79-80% ''abv''. The flavored distillate is diluted and sweetened and rested for minimum of 30 days prior to sale in order to allow the flavors to harmonize.\n\n== Serving and drinking ==\n[[File:Rak\u0131 toasting.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Toasting with rak\u0131, in typical rak\u0131 glasses]]\nIn [[Turkey]], rak\u0131 is the  national drink and is traditionally consumed with chilled water on the side or partly mixed with chilled water, according to personal preference. Rak\u0131 is rarely consumed without the addition of water. Ice cubes are often added. Dilution with water causes rak\u0131 to turn a milky-white colour, similar to the [[Ouzo effect|louche]] of [[absinthe]]. This phenomenon has resulted in the drink being popularly referred to ''aslan s\u00fct\u00fc'' (\"lion's milk\").<ref>{{cite web|author=|title=Get Cooking, Fine Living Fans!|url=http://www.fineliving.com/fine/thirsty_traveler/episode/0,1663,FINE_10176_43295,00.html|publisher=Cooking channel|date=|accessdate=2011-07-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090912011414/http://www.fineliving.com/fine/thirsty_traveler/episode/0,1663,FINE_10176_43295,00.html |archive-date=2009-09-12}}</ref> Since ''aslan'' (\"lion\") is a Turkish colloquial metaphor for a strong, courageous man, this gives the term a meaning close to \"the milk for the strong\".\n\nRak\u0131 is commonly consumed alongside [[meze]], a selection of hot and cold appetizers, as well as at a ''rak\u0131 sofras\u0131'' (\"rak\u0131 table\"), either before a full dinner or instead of it. It is especially popular with seafood, together with fresh [[arugula]], [[beyaz peynir]] and melon. It is an equally popular complement to various red meat dishes like [[kebab]]s, where it is sometimes served with a glass of [[\u015falgam]].\n\nThe founder and first President of the [[Republic of Turkey]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], was very fond of rak\u0131, and his late-night ''rak\u0131 sofras\u0131'' sessions were his favorite place to debate issues with his closest friends and advisors.<ref>G\u00e1bor \u00c1goston, Bruce Alan Masters, ''Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire'', 2008, {{ISBN|0-8160-6259-5}}, p. 60</ref><ref>Geoffrey L. Lewis, ''The Turkish language reform: a catastrophic success'', 1999, {{ISBN|0-19-823856-8}}, p. 42</ref>\n\n== Types and brands ==\n[[File:Kreta Raki PL.JPG|thumb|150px|left|A bottle of Greek ''Rak\u0131''.]]\nStandard rak\u0131 is a [[grape]] product, though it may be produced from [[ficus|fig]]s as well. Rak\u0131 produced from figs, particularly popular in the southern provinces of Turkey, is called ''incir bo\u011fmas\u0131'', ''incir rak\u0131s\u0131'' (\"fig rak\u0131\"), or in Arabic, ''tini''. Tekel ceased producing fig rak\u0131 in 1947.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}\n\nThere are two methods of Turkish rak\u0131 production. One method uses raisins and other grapes. ''Yeni Rak\u0131'' is produced from raisins and ''Tekirda\u011f Rak\u0131s\u0131'' is produced from grapes. Fresh grape rak\u0131 is like [[ouzo]] but has a higher alcohol content.\n\nSuma rak\u0131, i.e. distilled rak\u0131 prior to the addition of aniseed, is generally produced from [[raisins]] but raki factories around established wine-producing areas like [[Tekirda\u011f]], [[Nev\u015fehir]], and [[\u0130zmir]] may also use fresh grapes for higher quality. Recently, ''ya\u015f \u00fcz\u00fcm rak\u0131s\u0131'' (\"fresh-grape raki\") has become more popular in Turkey. The maker of a recent brand, ''Efe Rak\u0131'', was the first company to produce raki exclusively of fresh grape suma, called ''Efe Ya\u015f \u00dcz\u00fcm Rak\u0131s\u0131'' (Efe Fresh Grape Raki). ''Tekirda\u011f Alt\u0131n Seri'' (Tekirda\u011f Golden Series) followed the trend and many others have been produced by other companies.\n\nThe best-known and popular brands of rak\u0131, however, remain ''Yeni Rak\u0131'', originally produced by Tekel, which transferred production rights to Mey Alkol upon the 2004 privatization of Tekel, and ''Tekirda\u011f Rak\u0131s\u0131'' from the region of [[Tekirda\u011f]], which is famous for its characteristic flavour, believed to be due to the [[wikt:artesian|artesian]] waters of [[\u00c7orlu]] used in its production. ''Yeni Rak\u0131'' has an [[ethanol|alcohol]] content of 45% and 1.5 [[gram]]s of aniseed per [[litre|liter]]; ''Tekirda\u011f Rak\u0131s\u0131'' is 45% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]] and has 1.7&nbsp;grams of aniseed per liter. There are also two top-quality brands called ''Kul\u00fcp Rak\u0131s\u0131'' and ''Alt\u0131nba\u015f'', each with 50% ABV.\n\n''Dip rak\u0131s\u0131'' (\"bottom rak\u0131\") is the rak\u0131 that remains in the bottom of the tanks during production. Bottom rak\u0131 is thought to best capture the dense aroma and flavour of the spirit, and is also called ''\u00f6zel rak\u0131'' (\"special raki\"). It is not generally available commercially; instead, rak\u0131 factories reserve it as a prestigious gift for large clients.\n\n==Events==\nAniseed-flavoured Rak\u0131, has been celebrated as a festival in [[Adana]] and [[Northern Cyprus]] since 2010. [[World Rak\u0131 Festival]] in Adana, emerged from a hundred-year tradition of enjoying [[Adana kebab]], with liver, [[\u015falgam]] and rak\u0131. The event turned into a nationwide popular street festival, street musicians playing drums and [[zurna]], entertain visitors all night long at the second Saturday night of every December.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/haber/turkiye/rakicilar-bir-kez-daha-dunya-raki-gunune-hazirlaniyor|title=Rak\u0131c\u0131lar bir kez daha \"D\u00fcnya Rak\u0131 G\u00fcn\u00fc\"nde bulu\u015fuyor|website=CNN T\u00fcrk |language=tr |date=27 November 2014}}</ref> '''North Cyprus Rak\u0131 Festival''' is a week long festival taking place in  [[Girne]], [[Lefko\u015fa]] and [[Gazi Ma\u011fusa]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kibrisrakifestivali.com/hakkinda.html|title=K\u0131br\u0131s Rak\u0131 Festivali|website=www.kibrisrakifestivali.com |language=tr |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180823184555/http://www.kibrisrakifestivali.com/hakkinda.html |archive-date=2018-08-23}}</ref>\n\n==Other uses==\nIn [[Crete]] ''[[tsikoudia]]'' is a [[pomace brandy]] that is sometimes called ''rak\u0131'' but made from grapes.

Before entering the junior ranks in Ontario, he grew up playing minor hockey in his hometown. As a 15-year-old, he was identified through the Ontario U-17 program and signed with the [[Stratford Cullitons]] Jr. B (OHA) club for the 1990\u201391 season. One of his defence partners in Stratford was future NHLer [[Greg de Vries]].\n\nIn May 1991, Pronger indicated he was going to join his older brother [[Sean Pronger|Sean]] at [[Bowling Green State University]] to play in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] instead of opting to play in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL). Regardless of his pre-draft indications, the [[Peterborough Petes]] selected Pronger in the sixth round in the OHL Priority Selection. Contrary to his initial intentions, Pronger reported to Peterborough.\n\nAfter two stand-out seasons with Peterborough, and because of being highly regarded for his rare combination of imposing size, speed, offensive skill (particularly on the power play) and physicality, Pronger was selected second overall by the [[Hartford Whalers]] in the [[1993 NHL Entry Draft]], behind [[Alexandre Daigle]], who made the infamous statement, \"I'm glad I got drafted first, because no one remembers number two.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Alexandre wasn't all that great|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/02/sports/sp-briefing2|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2008-07-13|date=2007-06-02|last=Foster|first=Chris}}</ref>\n\n===Hartford Whalers===\nPronger made his debut in the [[1993\u201394 NHL season]], playing 81 games for the Whalers and earning a spot on the [[NHL All-Rookie Team]]. However, he was one of multiple Whalers that season with off-ice issues, being one of six players arrested for a barroom brawl in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] in late March (the brawl also involved a Whalers assistant coach), and then being arrested for [[drunk driving]] in Ohio three days after his rookie season ended, leading some to consider Pronger impatient and immature.<ref name=\"Immature\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/columns/wigge/pronger060906.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012041943/http://www.nhl.com/columns/wigge/pronger060906.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-10-12 |title=Pronger twists, turns into champion |accessdate=2007-02-26 |publisher=NHL.com |year=2006 |author=Wigge, Larry }}</ref> On his rookie season, then-teammate [[Kelly Chase]] said, \"You could see [Pronger] had talent, but it was a ho-hum thing.

Late in his first season in St. Louis, the acquisition of [[Wayne Gretzky]] took pressure off Pronger which, combined with Keenan's practices, allowed Pronger to concentrate on improving his defensive play.<ref name=IM2/>\n\nIn his third season with St. Louis and first as team captain, Pronger was again named to the All-Star team. That year, he also had a brief cardiac arrest during the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs]] when he was hit in the chest with a puck in a game against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/talent/danpatrick/s/2001/0307/1136701.html Dan Patrick:Outtakes: Chris Pronger (uncut)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Prior to this, he played for the Canadian Olympic team in [[1998 Olympics|Nagano]]. In [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000]], Pronger recorded a career-high 62 points and a +52 rating. His efforts won him the [[Norris Trophy|Norris]] and Hart trophies at the end of the season. Pronger beat [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]] winner [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr]] by just one point in Hart Trophy voting, which was, at the time, the smallest margin of victory in the history of the award. (Two years later, [[Jarome Iginla]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Th\u00e9odore]] tied in overall voting; Th\u00e9odore won with more first-place votes.)<ref>{{cite book |editor=Smith, Cheryl M |title=FaceOff 2001 NHL Yearbook |year=2000 |publisher=Worldsport Properties, Inc. |location=Toronto |pages=5}}</ref>  Pronger was also named to the [[NHL All-Star Team|First All-Star Team]].\n\nPronger scored 47 points the next season, but appeared in only 51 games due to injury problems. In February 2002, he won a gold medal with the Team Canada at the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]]. That same year in the NHL, he had another fine season and played in the All-Star Game once again. But injuries became a problem again in 2002\u201303, limiting him to just five games played, during which time [[Al MacInnis]] replaced him as captain. Pronger bounced back with another quality season in [[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304]]. Following the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout]] and the imposition of an NHL [[salary cap]], the Blues traded Pronger to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for defencemen [[Eric Brewer]], [[Jeff Woywitka]] and [[Doug Lynch (ice hockey)|Doug Lynch]]. While the Blues needed to reduce team salaries to make it easier to sell the team, the Oilers were able to sign Pronger to a five-year, $31.25&nbsp;million contract.\n\n===Edmonton Oilers===\nPronger was selected to play for Team Canada at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], marking his third consecutive Olympic Games. The Oilers went to the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] that same year. On June 5, 2006, in Game 1 of the [[2006 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], Pronger became the first player in NHL history to score a [[penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]] goal in a Stanley Cup Final game. The Oilers lost in Game 7, with Pronger scoring a team-high 21 points (5 goals and 16 assists) in 24 playoff games, as well as a team leading plus/minus rating of +10 during the playoffs.\n\nOn June 23, 2006, Pronger requested a trade through his agent, Pat Morris, from the Edmonton Oilers.

A playoff run marked by an upset of the [[New Jersey Devils]], a historic comeback against the [[Boston Bruins]] from down three games to none in the series and a five-game win over the [[Montreal Canadiens]] culminated in the Flyers playing the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in the [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals]]. Although the Flyers lost the series four games to two, Pronger had a strong playoff performance and led a team that traded for him to the Finals for the third time in a row. Conversely, no team that traded Pronger away qualified for the playoffs the following year.\n\nFollowing the playoffs, Pronger underwent [[Arthroscopy|arthroscopic knee surgery]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arthroscopic knee surgery successful for Pronger|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=535440|accessdate=2010-09-13|publisher=NHL.com}}</ref> Pronger missed the first two games of the {{NHL Year|2010}} season. Various other injuries would limit Pronger to just 50 games, marking the first time that Pronger missed significant time since the {{NHL Year|2002}} season, when he missed 77 games. On September 16, 2011, Pronger was named the 18th captain in Flyers history, replacing [[Mike Richards]], who was traded to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] just prior to the [[2011 NHL Entry Draft]]. However, multiple hits resulting in [[post-concussion syndrome]] (the last being a collision with [[Martin Hanzal]], who, like Pronger, is 6'6\") limited Pronger to 13 games before Pronger was shut down for the season in mid-December, with [[post-concussion syndrome]] placing Pronger's playing career in jeopardy. Pronger also had problems in his right eye after being struck by the stick of [[Mikhail Grabovski]] in October 2011.<ref name=\"thehockeynews.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/53795-The-Magazine-Chris-Pronger-still-at-large.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219035150/http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/53795-The-Magazine-Chris-Pronger-still-at-large.html# |archive-date=2013-12-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith a resumption of his playing career looking unlikely, Pronger stepped down as team captain and was succeeded by [[Claude Giroux]] on January 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=650546 |title=Claude Giroux named Captain of the Flyers |publisher=Philadelphia Flyers |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref> However, Pronger did not officially retire from the NHL because his contract ran through to the 2016\u201317 season. Under the terms of the NHL collective bargaining agreement, because he was at least 35 years old before the contract began, the Flyers were on the hook for the $4.9&nbsp;million cost against the salary cap each season, though they were able to receive relief by placing Pronger on long-term injured reserve at the start of each season. Had Pronger formally retired, the Flyers would lose that ability and his contract amount would have counted in full against the cap and he would not receive the remainder of the amounts owed to him under the contract ($12.15&nbsp;million at the start of the 2013\u201314 season). \n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=686848 |title=Flyers' Pronger 'never going to play again' |publisher=NHL |date= October 15, 2013 |accessdate= October 15, 2013}}</ref> While no longer playing, Pronger remained with the Flyers organization helping to scout and interview prospects.<ref name=\"thehockeynews.com\"/>\n\n===Arizona Coyotes===\nOn June 27, 2015, the Philadelphia Flyers traded Pronger's playing rights (alongside [[Nicklas Grossmann]]) to the [[Arizona Coyotes]] in exchange for [[Sam Gagner]] and a conditional draft pick. The deal was made to the benefit of salary cap implications to each club, as Pronger never played for Arizona. Three days later, on June 30, 2015, he was named to the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]; because the Hall only counts games played as its criteria for the minimum waiting period, Pronger was eligible for induction even though he was still technically an active player, as he had not played a game in three full seasons at the time of his induction.<ref name=\"hhof-announcement\" />\n\n==Post-playing career==\nAfter his contract finally expired following the [[2017 NHL Entry Draft]], on June 22, Pronger signed with the [[Florida Panthers]] to become the organization's senior advisor of hockey operations.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=Tim|title=Chris Pronger joins Florida Panthers' front office|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/chris-pronger-panthers-front-office-1.4172961|website=CBC|accessdate=February 1, 2018|date=June 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nPronger married his wife Lauren in 1999, and together the couple have three children.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://downloads.ducks.nhl.com/other/ANAplayoffguide09.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714180431/http://downloads.ducks.nhl.com/other/ANAplayoffguide09.pdf# |archive-date=2011-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php?ci_id=11737&la_id=1&ss_id=22222&player_id=12378 | title=The Official Website of Hockey Canada &#124; Minor Hockey, Team Canada, National Championships and more}}</ref> He lived in [[Irvine, California]], while playing for the Anaheim Ducks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lansner.freedomblogging.com/2007/12/06/shady-canyons-last-lot-is-sold/ | author=Lansner, Jon | title=Shady Canyon's last lot goes for $1.9 million | date=2007-12-06 | publisher=[[Orange County Register]] | accessdate=2008-05-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222153602/http://lansner.freedomblogging.com/2007/12/06/shady-canyons-last-lot-is-sold/ | archivedate=2007-12-22 }}</ref> and in [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]], while playing for the Philadelphia Flyers.

He was captain of the Blues, Ducks and Flyers. He has appeared in the [[Stanley Cup]] finals with three different teams (Edmonton, Anaheim and Philadelphia), winning the Cup with the Ducks in 2007.

Before entering the junior ranks in Ontario, he grew up playing minor hockey in his hometown. As a 15-year-old, he was identified through the Ontario U-17 program and signed with the [[Stratford Cullitons]] Jr. B (OHA) club for the 1990\u201391 season. One of his defence partners in Stratford was future NHLer [[Greg de Vries]].\n\nIn May 1991, Pronger indicated he was going to join his older brother [[Sean Pronger|Sean]] at [[Bowling Green State University]] to play in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] instead of opting to play in the [[Ontario Hockey League]] (OHL). Regardless of his pre-draft indications, the [[Peterborough Petes]] selected Pronger in the sixth round in the OHL Priority Selection. Contrary to his initial intentions, Pronger reported to Peterborough.\n\nAfter two stand-out seasons with Peterborough, and because of being highly regarded for his rare combination of imposing size, speed, offensive skill (particularly on the power play) and physicality, Pronger was selected second overall by the [[Hartford Whalers]] in the [[1993 NHL Entry Draft]], behind [[Alexandre Daigle]], who made the infamous statement, \"I'm glad I got drafted first, because no one remembers number two.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Alexandre wasn't all that great|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/02/sports/sp-briefing2|publisher=LA Times|accessdate=2008-07-13|date=2007-06-02|last=Foster|first=Chris}}</ref>\n\n===Hartford Whalers===\nPronger made his debut in the [[1993\u201394 NHL season]], playing 81 games for the Whalers and earning a spot on the [[NHL All-Rookie Team]]. However, he was one of multiple Whalers that season with off-ice issues, being one of six players arrested for a barroom brawl in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] in late March (the brawl also involved a Whalers assistant coach), and then being arrested for [[drunk driving]] in Ohio three days after his rookie season ended, leading some to consider Pronger impatient and immature.<ref name=\"Immature\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/columns/wigge/pronger060906.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081012041943/http://www.nhl.com/columns/wigge/pronger060906.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-10-12 |title=Pronger twists, turns into champion |accessdate=2007-02-26 |publisher=NHL.com |year=2006 |author=Wigge, Larry }}</ref> On his rookie season, then-teammate [[Kelly Chase]] said, \"You could see [Pronger] had talent, but it was a ho-hum thing.

Of course that team wasn't exactly overloaded with players who knew how to win\" (the Whalers finished second-last in the Eastern Conference that season).<ref name=IM2>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1011730/index.htm|title=Looming Large = Arrests, brawls and boozing were on Chris Pronger's resume before he grew up to be a soaring presence for the Blues|author=Farber, Michael|publisher=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=1999-12-29|accessdate=2012-07-21}}</ref> After a second season in Hartford, on July 27, 1995, he was traded to the [[St. Louis Blues]] in exchange for star forward [[Brendan Shanahan]].\n\n===St. Louis Blues===\nIn the early years of his St. Louis career, Pronger played under coach and general manager [[Mike Keenan]], who insisted he improve his conditioning and reduce his mistakes. Late in his first season in St. Louis, the acquisition of [[Wayne Gretzky]] took pressure off Pronger which, combined with Keenan's practices, allowed Pronger to concentrate on improving his defensive play.<ref name=IM2/>\n\nIn his third season with St. Louis and first as team captain, Pronger was again named to the All-Star team. That year, he also had a brief cardiac arrest during the [[1998 Stanley Cup playoffs]] when he was hit in the chest with a puck in a game against the [[Detroit Red Wings]].<ref>[http://espn.go.com/talent/danpatrick/s/2001/0307/1136701.html Dan Patrick:Outtakes: Chris Pronger (uncut)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Prior to this, he played for the Canadian Olympic team in [[1998 Olympics|Nagano]]. In [[1999\u20132000 NHL season|1999\u20132000]], Pronger recorded a career-high 62 points and a +52 rating. His efforts won him the [[Norris Trophy|Norris]] and Hart trophies at the end of the season. Pronger beat [[Art Ross Trophy|Art Ross]] winner [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr]] by just one point in Hart Trophy voting, which was, at the time, the smallest margin of victory in the history of the award. (Two years later, [[Jarome Iginla]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Th\u00e9odore]] tied in overall voting; Th\u00e9odore won with more first-place votes.)<ref>{{cite book |editor=Smith, Cheryl M |title=FaceOff 2001 NHL Yearbook |year=2000 |publisher=Worldsport Properties, Inc. |location=Toronto |pages=5}}</ref>  Pronger was also named to the [[NHL All-Star Team|First All-Star Team]].\n\nPronger scored 47 points the next season, but appeared in only 51 games due to injury problems. In February 2002, he won a gold medal with the Team Canada at the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City]]. That same year in the NHL, he had another fine season and played in the All-Star Game once again. But injuries became a problem again in 2002\u201303, limiting him to just five games played, during which time [[Al MacInnis]] replaced him as captain. Pronger bounced back with another quality season in [[2003\u201304 NHL season|2003\u201304]]. Following the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout]] and the imposition of an NHL [[salary cap]], the Blues traded Pronger to the Edmonton Oilers in exchange for defencemen [[Eric Brewer]], [[Jeff Woywitka]] and [[Doug Lynch (ice hockey)|Doug Lynch]]. While the Blues needed to reduce team salaries to make it easier to sell the team, the Oilers were able to sign Pronger to a five-year, $31.25&nbsp;million contract.\n\n===Edmonton Oilers===\nPronger was selected to play for Team Canada at the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], marking his third consecutive Olympic Games. The Oilers went to the [[Stanley Cup Finals]] that same year. On June 5, 2006, in Game 1 of the [[2006 Stanley Cup Finals|Stanley Cup Finals]] against the [[Carolina Hurricanes]], Pronger became the first player in NHL history to score a [[penalty shot (ice hockey)|penalty shot]] goal in a Stanley Cup Final game. The Oilers lost in Game 7, with Pronger scoring a team-high 21 points (5 goals and 16 assists) in 24 playoff games, as well as a team leading plus/minus rating of +10 during the playoffs.\n\nOn June 23, 2006, Pronger requested a trade through his agent, Pat Morris, from the Edmonton Oilers.

However, upon new video evidence which provided a better angle, the NHL again reviewed the incident and issued Pronger an eight-game suspension.

Pronger had 2 goals and 8 assists in 13 playoff games.\n\n===Philadelphia Flyers===\n [[File:Chris Pronger 2010-03-27.JPG|thumb|right|Pronger with the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in 2010]]\nOn June 27, 2009, Pronger (along with forward Ryan Dingle) was traded to the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] in exchange for Joffrey Lupul (earlier traded to Edmonton for Pronger in 2006), defenceman [[Luca Sbisa]], two first-round draft picks and a conditional third-round draft pick. Ten days later, Pronger signed a seven-year contract extension.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2009/07/07/pronger_extension_flyers/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2009-07-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002213025/http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/2009/07/07/pronger_extension_flyers/# |archive-date=2009-10-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Nearly a month after signing, the NHL announced they had launched an investigation on Pronger's contract to determine whether it circumvented the [[NHL collective bargaining agreement]]'s [[salary cap]]. Because the contract was front-loaded, with annual salaries of just $525,000 in the final two years and was set to expire when Pronger turned 42, the investigation was launched with the focus on the potential for negotiations between Pronger and the Flyers to retire before the contract expired.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sources:NHL investigates Marian Hossa, Chris Pronger contracts|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nhl/news/story?id=4369897|accessdate=2009-10-16|date=2009-08-01|publisher=[[ESPN]]}}</ref> However, as Pronger's contract took effect after his 35th birthday, under the terms of the current collective bargaining agreement, his over-35 contract cannot be deleted from the Flyers' cap space unless he is placed on long-term injured reserve, and even then it would come back on the team's cap space during the off-season.\n\nOn December 30, 2009, Pronger was selected to play for Team Canada at the 2010 Winter Olympics in [[Vancouver]]. He served as one of the team's alternate captains, along with [[Sidney Crosby]] and [[Jarome Iginla]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Canadian Olympic Hockey Team: 2010 Roster Released|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/30/canadian-olympic-hockey-t_n_407458.html|accessdate=2009-12-30|work=The Huffington Post|first=Craig|last=Kanalley|date=December 30, 2009}}</ref> The team won the gold medal that year. After playing in his 25th Olympic game for Canada on February 28, 2010, Pronger became Canada's all-time leader in Olympic games played.\n\nIn the NHL regular season, the Flyers qualified for the [[2010 Stanley Cup playoffs|2010 playoffs]] on the last day of the season with a shootout win against the [[New York Rangers]]. A playoff run marked by an upset of the [[New Jersey Devils]], a historic comeback against the [[Boston Bruins]] from down three games to none in the series and a five-game win over the [[Montreal Canadiens]] culminated in the Flyers playing the [[Chicago Blackhawks]] in the [[2010 Stanley Cup Finals]]. Although the Flyers lost the series four games to two, Pronger had a strong playoff performance and led a team that traded for him to the Finals for the third time in a row. Conversely, no team that traded Pronger away qualified for the playoffs the following year.\n\nFollowing the playoffs, Pronger underwent [[Arthroscopy|arthroscopic knee surgery]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Arthroscopic knee surgery successful for Pronger|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=535440|accessdate=2010-09-13|publisher=NHL.com}}</ref> Pronger missed the first two games of the {{NHL Year|2010}} season. Various other injuries would limit Pronger to just 50 games, marking the first time that Pronger missed significant time since the {{NHL Year|2002}} season, when he missed 77 games. On September 16, 2011, Pronger was named the 18th captain in Flyers history, replacing [[Mike Richards]], who was traded to the [[Los Angeles Kings]] just prior to the [[2011 NHL Entry Draft]]. However, multiple hits resulting in [[post-concussion syndrome]] (the last being a collision with [[Martin Hanzal]], who, like Pronger, is 6'6\") limited Pronger to 13 games before Pronger was shut down for the season in mid-December, with [[post-concussion syndrome]] placing Pronger's playing career in jeopardy. Pronger also had problems in his right eye after being struck by the stick of [[Mikhail Grabovski]] in October 2011.<ref name=\"thehockeynews.com\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/53795-The-Magazine-Chris-Pronger-still-at-large.html# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2013-11-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219035150/http://www.thehockeynews.com/articles/53795-The-Magazine-Chris-Pronger-still-at-large.html# |archive-date=2013-12-19 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nWith a resumption of his playing career looking unlikely, Pronger stepped down as team captain and was succeeded by [[Claude Giroux]] on January 15, 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=650546 |title=Claude Giroux named Captain of the Flyers |publisher=Philadelphia Flyers |date=January 15, 2013 |accessdate=January 15, 2013}}</ref> However, Pronger did not officially retire from the NHL because his contract ran through to the 2016\u201317 season. Under the terms of the NHL collective bargaining agreement, because he was at least 35 years old before the contract began, so the Flyers were on the hook for the $4.9&nbsp;million cost against the salary cap each season, though they were able to receive relief by placing Pronger on long-term injured reserve at the start of each season. Had Pronger formally retired, the Flyers would lose that ability and his contract amount would have counted in full against the cap and he would not receive the remainder of the amounts owed to him under the contract ($12.15&nbsp;million at the start of the 2013\u201314 season). \n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/ice/news.htm?id=686848 |title=Flyers' Pronger 'never going to play again' |publisher=NHL |date= October 15, 2013 |accessdate= October 15, 2013}}</ref> While no longer playing, Pronger remained with the Flyers organization helping to scout and interview prospects.<ref name=\"thehockeynews.com\"/>\n\n===Arizona Coyotes===\nOn June 27, 2015, the Philadelphia Flyers traded Pronger's playing rights (alongside [[Nicklas Grossmann]]) to the [[Arizona Coyotes]] in exchange for [[Sam Gagner]] and a conditional draft pick. The deal was made to the benefit of salary cap implications to each club, as Pronger never played for Arizona. Three days later, on June 30, 2015, he was named to the [[Hockey Hall of Fame]]; because the Hall only counts games played as its criteria for the minimum waiting period, Pronger was eligible for induction even though he was still technically an active player, as he had not played a game in three full seasons at the time of his induction.<ref name=\"hhof-announcement\" />\n\n==Post-playing career==\nAfter his contract finally expired following the [[2017 NHL Entry Draft]], on June 22, Pronger signed with the [[Florida Panthers]] to become the organization's senior advisor of hockey operations.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Reynolds|first1=Tim|title=Chris Pronger joins Florida Panthers' front office|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/hockey/nhl/chris-pronger-panthers-front-office-1.4172961|website=CBC|accessdate=February 1, 2018|date=June 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nPronger married his wife Lauren in 1999, and together the couple have three children.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://downloads.ducks.nhl.com/other/ANAplayoffguide09.pdf# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-11-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714180431/http://downloads.ducks.nhl.com/other/ANAplayoffguide09.pdf# |archive-date=2011-07-14 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hockeycanada.ca/index.php?ci_id=11737&la_id=1&ss_id=22222&player_id=12378 | title=The Official Website of Hockey Canada &#124; Minor Hockey, Team Canada, National Championships and more}}</ref> He lived in [[Irvine, California]], while playing for the Anaheim Ducks.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://lansner.freedomblogging.com/2007/12/06/shady-canyons-last-lot-is-sold/ | author=Lansner, Jon | title=Shady Canyon's last lot goes for $1.9 million | date=2007-12-06 | publisher=[[Orange County Register]] | accessdate=2008-05-08 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222153602/http://lansner.freedomblogging.com/2007/12/06/shady-canyons-last-lot-is-sold/ | archivedate=2007-12-22 }}</ref> and in [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]], while playing for the Philadelphia Flyers.
