Deforestation can be attributed to population growth, change in household dynamics, and resource management.

The battle was fought on 6 July 1782.<ref name=\"Castex269\">[[#Castex|Castex (2004)]], pp. 269\u2013272</ref> The battle was indecisive but Suffren was thwarted in his goal by Hughes and withdrew to [[Cuddalore]], while the British remained in control of Negapatam.<ref name=\"Fredriksen176\"/><ref name=\"Sweetman176\"/>\n\n== Background ==\nFrance had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1778, and Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] in late 1780, after the Dutch refused to stop trading in military supplies with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process. [[Negapatam]] was [[Siege of Negapatam|sieged and taken]] by [[Hector Munro, 8th laird of Novar|Sir Hector Munro]] in November 1781.\n\nThe French admiral the Bailli de Suffren was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in [[India]]. He arrived in February 1782, and immediately engaged the British fleet of Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in the inconclusive [[Battle of Sadras]]. After both fleets spent time in port repairing, refitting, and re-provisioning, they met again in the April [[Battle of Providien]], south of the [[Ceylon]]ese port of [[Trincomalee]], that was ended by a storm and then nightfall. Hughes put into Trincomalee, a formerly Dutch port the British [[Capture of Trincomalee|had captured]] in January, for repairs, while Suffren went to the Dutch-controlled port of [[Batticaloa]].\n\nWhile at Batticaloa, Suffren received dispatches from the \u00cele de France (now [[Mauritius]]) that ordered him to return there to escort additional French troops to India. He chose not to do so, citing the parity between the two fleets, and the need to defend French troops already on the ground in India against the movements of the British fleet.\n\nThe French, with about 2,000 effective troops under the command of Comte du Chemin, had captured [[Cuddalore]] on 6 May. [[Hyder Ali]], the ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], originally wanted the French to take the more important port of Negapatam. The French joined with Hyder's army of 60,000 to lay siege to the British at [[Vandavasi]]. When the British sent an army of 12,000 toward Vandavasi to relieve the siege, du Chemin, against the wishes of Hyder, refused to engage in a battle that the Franco-Mysorean force would probably have won (which would have significantly reduced the British military presence in India). As a result, Hyder lifted the siege and retreated to the vicinity of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]].\n\nHyder Ali learned of Suffren's actions in the first two battles with Hughes, and sent a message to Suffren to arrange a meeting. Suffren had in the meantime sailed from Batticaloa to do the job that du Chemin would not: capture Negapatam. He stopped at Cuddalore on 20 June to take on troops and supplies for the attack, which he hoped to do by surprise. When he was ready to sail he learned that Hughes had sailed past, apparently also en route to Negapatam. As his fleet had grown by captured prizes and arrivals from \u00cele de France (it was now twelve [[ships of the line]] and four frigates), Suffren gave chase and caught up with Hughes, who had anchored off Negapatam, on 5 July.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:SouthIndia1794.jpeg|thumb|right|Detail of a 1794 map of south India and Ceylon. Batticaloa is north of the southeastern point of Ceylon]]\n\nSuffren was in the process of forming his battle line around 3&nbsp;pm when a [[squall]] took down the main and mizzen top masts of ''Ajax'', forcing her to drop out of his line. When the squall calmed, the breeze was to Hughes' advantage so he sailed from his anchorage at the harbour of Negapatam. The two fleets spent the night anchored two cannonshots apart.\n\nThe next morning, Suffren was infuriated to learn that repairs had not been made to ''Ajax'', and that her captain wanted to retreat. Given that battle was imminent, Suffren refused. He then ordered his line to bear down on the British line for close action. As they began to move, ''Ajax'' stood away and did not join the action. At 9:30&nbsp;am on 6 July, the fleets opened fire on each other, first at long range. ''Flamand'' engaged ''Hero'' and ''Exeter'', ''Annibal'' engaged ''Isis'', ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' faced ''Burford'', and ''Brillant'' opposed ''Sultan'' while the two flagships, ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Superb'', did battle with each other. The remainder of the British line was not able to directly line up against the French, resulting in an angle in their line where ''Sphinx'' and ''Monarca'' battled that minimized the action between the ships at the end of the line. ''Flamand'' took significant damage, but was able to return the favour to its opponents. ''Brillant'' began to suffer under the fire of ''Sultan'', but Suffren managed to detach from ''H\u00e9ros'' to come to her rescue.\n\nThe battle proceeded with vigour until about 1&nbsp;pm, when the wind suddenly changed, throwing both lines into confusion. With the wind head-on to the two parallel lines of ships, some ships turned to starboard and some to port.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556>[[#Clowes|Clowes (Vol.III)]], p.556</ref> The majority turned away from the engagement but six ships, four British and two French, turned in towards one another. The four British ships were the fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth in line, respectively ''Burford'', ''Sultan'', ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle''; the two French were ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' (third in line) and towards the rear of the line ''Brillant'', which was dismasted by this stage. ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' was engaged by ''Sultan'' and \"two other ships\", and escaped through the arrival of Suffren in his flagship and the filling of her sails as she fell off to starboard, while ''Brillant'' was fired on by ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle'', and was also rescued by the approach of Suffren's ship, though not before the loss of over a third of her complement dead or wounded.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556/>\n\nWith occasional meetings between two ships, Hughes attempted to reform his line around 2&nbsp;pm, but neither fleet was in a state to adopt battle positions easily, so Suffren decided to draw away downwind, to the north, toward Cuddalore. One British observer noted that \"our fleet was utterly incapable of preventing or pursuing them\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moir |first1=John |title=Transactions in India |date=1786 |publisher=John Debrett |page=[https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog/page/n477 470] |url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSuffren had been thwarted in his efforts to take to Negapatam<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> &ndash; he stripped M. Bouvet, the captain of ''Ajax'', of his command, and arrested three others for a variety of transgressions in this battle and the previous two. One of those arrested, M. de Cillart, commander of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'', had started to [[striking the colors|strike his colors]] during one of the post-squall engagements, but his subordinates prevented the act.<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> Suffren then sailed for Cuddalore to effect repairs. Hughes spent the next two weeks at sea, only returning to [[Chennai|Madras]] for repairs on 20 July. Negapatam would remain in British hands until the end of the war.

The battle was fought on 6 July 1782.<ref name=\"Castex269\">[[#Castex|Castex (2004)]], pp. 269\u2013272</ref> The battle was indecisive but Suffren was thwarted in his goal by Hughes and withdrew to [[Cuddalore]], while the British remained in control of Negapatam.<ref name=\"Fredriksen176\"/><ref name=\"Sweetman176\"/>\n\n== Background ==\nFrance had entered the [[American Revolutionary War]] in 1778, and Britain declared war on the [[Dutch Republic]] in late 1780, after the Dutch refused to stop trading in military supplies with the French and the Americans. The British had rapidly gained control over most French and Dutch outposts in India when news of these events reached India, spawning the [[Second Anglo-Mysore War]] in the process. [[Negapatam]] was [[Siege of Negapatam|sieged and taken]] by [[Hector Munro, 8th laird of Novar|Sir Hector Munro]] in November 1781.\n\nThe French admiral the Bailli de Suffren was dispatched on a mission to provide military assistance to French colonies in [[India]]. He arrived in February 1782, and immediately engaged the British fleet of Vice-Admiral Sir Edward Hughes in the inconclusive [[Battle of Sadras]]. After both fleets spent time in port repairing, refitting, and re-provisioning, they met again in the April [[Battle of Providien]], south of the [[Ceylon]]ese port of [[Trincomalee]], that was ended by a storm and then nightfall. Hughes put into Trincomalee, a formerly Dutch port the British [[Capture of Trincomalee|had captured]] in January, for repairs, while Suffren went to the Dutch-controlled port of [[Batticaloa]].\n\nWhile at Batticaloa, Suffren received dispatches from the \u00cele de France (now [[Mauritius]]) that ordered him to return there to escort additional French troops to India. He chose not to do so, citing the parity between the two fleets, and the need to defend French troops already on the ground in India against the movements of the British fleet.\n\nThe French, with about 2,000 effective troops under the command of Comte du Chemin, had captured [[Cuddalore]] on 6 May. [[Hyder Ali]], the ruler of [[Kingdom of Mysore|Mysore]], originally wanted the French to take the more important port of Negapatam. The French joined with Hyder's army of 60,000 to lay siege to the British at [[Vandavasi]]. When the British sent an army of 12,000 toward Vandavasi to relieve the siege, du Chemin, against the wishes of Hyder, refused to engage in a battle that the Franco-Mysorean force would probably have won (which would have significantly reduced the British military presence in India). As a result, Hyder lifted the siege and retreated to the vicinity of [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]].\n\nHyder Ali learned of Suffren's actions in the first two battles with Hughes, and sent a message to Suffren to arrange a meeting. Suffren had in the meantime sailed from Batticaloa to do the job that du Chemin would not: capture Negapatam. He stopped at Cuddalore on 20 June to take on troops and supplies for the attack, which he hoped to do by surprise. When he was ready to sail he learned that Hughes had sailed past, apparently also en route to Negapatam. As his fleet had grown by captured prizes and arrivals from \u00cele de France (it was now twelve [[ships of the line]] and four frigates), Suffren gave chase and caught up with Hughes, who had anchored off Negapatam, on 5 July.\n\n== Battle ==\n[[File:SouthIndia1794.jpeg|thumb|right|Detail of a 1794 map of south India and Ceylon. Batticaloa is north of the southeastern point of Ceylon]]\n\nSuffren was in the process of forming his battle line around 3&nbsp;pm when a [[squall]] took down the main and mizzen top masts of ''Ajax'', forcing her to drop out of his line. When the squall calmed, the breeze was to Hughes' advantage so he sailed from his anchorage at the harbour of Negapatam. The two fleets spent the night anchored two cannonshots apart.\n\nThe next morning, Suffren was infuriated to learn that repairs had not been made to ''Ajax'', and that her captain wanted to retreat. Given that battle was imminent, Suffren refused. He then ordered his line to bear down on the British line for close action. As they began to move, ''Ajax'' stood away and did not join the action. At 9:30&nbsp;am on 6 July, the fleets opened fire on each other, first at long range. ''Flamand'' engaged ''Hero'' and ''Exeter'', ''Annibal'' engaged ''Isis'', ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' faced ''Burford'', and ''Brillant'' opposed ''Sultan'' while the two flagships, ''H\u00e9ros'' and ''Superb'', did battle with each other. The remainder of the British line was not able to directly line up against the French, resulting in an angle in their line where ''Sphinx'' and ''Monarca'' battled that minimized the action between the ships at the end of the line. ''Flamand'' took significant damage, but was able to return the favour to its opponents. ''Brillant'' began to suffer under the fire of ''Sultan'', but Suffren managed to detach from ''H\u00e9ros'' to come to her rescue.\n\nThe battle proceeded with vigour until about 1&nbsp;pm, when the wind suddenly changed, throwing both lines into confusion. With the wind head-on to the two parallel lines of ships, some ships turned to starboard and some to port.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556>[[#Clowes|Clowes (Vol.III)]], p.556</ref> The majority turned away from the engagement but six ships, four British and two French, turned in towards one another. The four British ships were the fourth, fifth, eighth and tenth in line, respectively ''Burford'', ''Sultan'', ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle''; the two French were ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' (third in line) and towards the rear of the line ''Brillant'', which was dismasted by this stage. ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'' was engaged by ''Sultan'' and \"two other ships\", and escaped through the arrival of Suffren in his flagship and the filling of her sails as she fell off to starboard, while ''Brillant'' was fired on by ''Worcester'' and ''Eagle'', and was also rescued by the approach of Suffren's ship, though not before the loss of over a third of her complement dead or wounded.<ref name=ClowesIIIp556/>\n\nWith occasional meetings between two ships, Hughes attempted to reform his line around 2&nbsp;pm, but neither fleet was in a state to adopt battle positions easily, so Suffren decided to draw away downwind, to the north, toward Cuddalore. One British observer noted that \"our fleet was utterly incapable of preventing or pursuing them\".<ref>{{cite book |last1=Moir |first1=John |title=Transactions in India |date=1786 |publisher=John Debrett |page=[https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog/page/n477 470] |url=https://archive.org/details/transactionsini01moirgoog |accessdate=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n== Aftermath ==\nSuffren had been thwarted in his efforts to take to Negapatam<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> &ndash; he stripped M. Bouvet, the captain of ''Ajax'', of his command, and arrested three others for a variety of transgressions in this battle and the previous two. One of those arrested, M. de Cillart, commander of ''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'', had started to [[striking the colors|strike his colors]] during one of the post-squall engagements, but his subordinates prevented the act.<ref name=\"Thomas153\"/> Suffren then sailed for Cuddalore to effect repairs. Hughes spent the next two weeks at sea, only returning to [[Chennai|Madras]] for repairs on 20 July. Negapatam would remain in British hands until the end of the war. At the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)]] the Dutch Republic would cede Negapatam to Britain.\n\n== Order of battle ==\n<ref name=cunat169>Cunat, p.169</ref>\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== Great Britain ===\n* {{HMS|Superb|1760|2}}, 74\n* {{HMS|Hero|1759|2}}, 74\n* {{HMS|Sultan|1775|2}}, 74\n* {{HMS|Burford|1757|2}}, 70\n* {{HMS|Monarca|1780|2}}, 70\n* {{HMS|Eagle|1774|2}}, 64\n* {{HMS|Exeter|1763|2}}, 64\n* {{HMS|Magnanime|1780|2}} 64\n* {{HMS|Monmouth|1772|2}}, 64\n* {{HMS|Worcester|1769|2}}, 64\n* {{HMS|Isis|1774|2}}, 50\n{{col-2}}\n\n=== France ===\n* [[French ship H\u00e9ros (1778)|''H\u00e9ros'']], 74\n* [[French ship Annibal (1779)|''Annibal'']], 74\n* [[French ship Orient (1756)|''Orient'']], 74\n* [[French ship Art\u00e9sien|''Art\u00e9sien'']], 64\n* [[French ship Brillant (1774)|''Brillant'']], 64\n* [[French ship Bizarre (1751)|''Bizarre'']], 64\n* [[French ship S\u00e9v\u00e8re (1778)|''S\u00e9v\u00e8re'']], 64\n* [[French ship Sphinx (1776)|''Sphinx'']], 64\n* [[French ship Vengeur (1765)|''Vengeur'']], 64\n* [[French ship Flamand (1764)|''Flamand'']], 50\n* [[HMS Hannibal (1779)|''Annibal'']], 50\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Notes, citations, and references ==\n\n'''Notes'''\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n'''Citations'''\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n'''References'''\n* {{cite book|title=Dictionnaire des batailles navales franco-anglaises|first=Jean-Claude|last=Castex|author-link =|publisher=Presses Universit\u00e9 Laval|year=2004|isbn=978-2-7637-8061-0|ref=Castex|location=|oclc=|url=|volume=}}\n* {{cite book|title=Warfare and armed conflicts: a statistical reference to casualty and other figures, 1500-2000|first=Micheal|last=Clodfelter|author-link=|publisher=McFarland|year=2002|isbn=978-0-7864-1204-4|ref=Clodfelter|location=|oclc=|url=|volume=}}\n* {{cite book|last = Clowes|first = William Laird|year = 1996|origyear= 1900|title = The Royal Navy, A History from the Earliest Times to 1900, Volume III|publisher = Chatham Publishing|location = London|isbn = 1-86176-012-4|ref=Clowes}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Cunat |first1=Charles |authorlink1=Charles Cunat|title=Histoire du Bailli de Suffren |date=1852 |publisher=A.

Produced by [[Daniel Lanois]], it was written for the [[Music of Red Dead Redemption 2|original soundtrack]] to the 2018 video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''. It was released as a digital single on January 4, 2019, through [[RCA Records]]. It was D'Angelo's first piece of new music released since his third studio album, ''[[Black Messiah (album)|Black Messiah]]'', released in December 2014. Following its official release, the song reached number 6 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Billboard charts#R&B/Hip-Hop|R&B Digital Song Sales]] chart.\n\n==Background==\nPrior to the release of \"Unshaken\", the last piece of music that D'Angelo put out was his third studio album, ''[[Black Messiah (album)|Black Messiah]]'', in December 2014, which acted as his first studio album in 14 years. In an interview with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' published in June 2015, he revealed that he was working on a \"companion piece\" to ''Black Messiah''.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/the-second-coming-of-dangelo-49555/ |title=The Second Coming of D'Angelo |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |date=June 15, 2015 |website=[[Rolling Stone]] |access-date=April 21, 2020}}</ref> Some time after the release of that album, D'Angelo discovered that [[Rockstar Games]] was developing a sequel to ''[[Red Dead Redemption]]'' (2010), a video game that he was a big fan of. He then became a [[playtest]]er for ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' and was impressed by it to the point where he was consistently playing it. Ivan Pavlovich, the director of music and audio at Rockstar, recalled that D'Angelo would come to Rockstar's office in New York City around midnight and be playing the game for several hours, adding that \"each time he was just like, 'it\u2019s incredible.' It just [blew] his mind.

Produced by [[Daniel Lanois]], it was written for the [[Music of Red Dead Redemption 2|original soundtrack]] to the 2018 video game ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]''. It was released as a digital single on January 4, 2019, through [[RCA Records]]. It was D'Angelo's first piece of new music released since his third studio album, ''[[Black Messiah (album)|Black Messiah]]'', released in December 2014.

He then became a [[playtest]]er for ''[[Red Dead Redemption 2]]'' and was impressed by it to the point where he was consistently playing it. Ivan Pavlovich, the director of music and audio at Rockstar, recalled that D'Angelo would come to Rockstar's office in New York City around midnight and be playing the game for several hours, adding that \"each time he was just like, 'it\u2019s incredible.' It just [blew] his mind.

It branches north from the [[Main Line (LIRR)|Main Line]] at [[Winfield Junction (LIRR station)|Winfield Junction]], just east of the [[Woodside (LIRR)|Woodside]] station in the [[New York City]] [[Borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Queens]], and runs roughly parallel to [[Northern Boulevard]] past Mets-Willets Point ([[Citi Field]]), [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Murray Hill, Queens|Murray Hill]], Broadway, [[Auburndale, Queens|Auburndale]], [[Bayside, Queens|Bayside]], [[Douglaston, Queens|Douglaston]], [[Little Neck, Queens|Little Neck]], and then crosses into [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]] for stops in [[Great Neck Plaza, New York|Great Neck]], [[Manhasset, New York|Manhasset]], and [[Plandome, New York|Plandome]] before terminating at [[Port Washington, New York|Port Washington]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mta.info/lirr/Timetable/lirrmap.htm|title=MTA LIRR - LIRR Map|work=mta.info}}</ref><ref>[http://mta.info/lirr/Timetable/Branch/PortWashingtonBranch.pdf LIRR Port Washington Branch Timetable]</ref>\n\nThe Port Washington Branch is the only LIRR branch to not serve [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica]], a major LIRR transportation hub, as it branches off the Main Line several miles northwest of that station.\n\n==Route description==\n[[Image:Port Washington Station - Main Street & Haven Avenue.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Port Washington Station from the corner of Main Street and Haven Avenue in [[Port Washington, New York]].]]\nThe line has two tracks from Woodside to Great Neck and one track from east of Great Neck past [[Manhasset (LIRR station)|Manhasset]] and [[Plandome (LIRR station)|Plandome]] stations to Port Washington. This often causes slight delays during two-way rush hour operations. A second track cannot be added through Manhasset and Plandome due to the proximity of businesses to the narrow right-of-way in Manhasset, and the fact that the trestle between Great Neck and Manhasset (the Manhasset viaduct, constructed 1898) has only one track.<ref>[http://www.forgotten-ny.com/SUBWAYS/pwbranch2/LIRRmanhassetbridge1.jpg Image of single track across Manhasset Viaduct]</ref>\n\nTo reduce delays on the heavily used line, most peak-hour east-bound trains (weekday afternoons/evenings) are either local from Penn Station to [[Great Neck (LIRR station)|Great Neck]] (making all stops in between the two) or express from Penn Station to [[Port Washington (LIRR station)|Port Washington]] (making stops only at Great Neck, Manhasset, Plandome, and Port Washington, although some trains make their first stop at [[Bayside (LIRR station)|Bayside]]). A mix of local and express peak-hour trains go west on weekday mornings.\n\nExtra service is offered during the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] tennis tournament and for [[New York Mets]] home games, both of which are held in [[Flushing Meadows-Corona Park|Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park]]. These trains stop at a special [[Mets\u2013Willets Point (LIRR station)|Mets\u2013Willets Point]] station between Woodside and [[Flushing Main Street (LIRR station)|Flushing Main Street]].\n\nThe route also runs along a high train trestle over the marshes at the southern end of Manhasset Bay. The bridge stands {{convert|81|ft|m}} tall and runs {{convert|678|ft|m}} across the bay, offering a view of the Manhasset Bay. Scenes from the silent film serial \"The Perils of Pauline\" are said to have been shot on the trestle.<ref>[http://www.kingbridgeco.com/manhasset_viaduct.htm King Bridge Company] Manhasset viaduct</ref>\n\n[[File:Winfield Junction jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Winfield Junction]]\n[[File:Manhasset Valley trestle spruce jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Manhasset Valley bridge, viewed from East Shore Road]]\n[[File:Manhasset LIRR viaduct.jpg|thumb|left|Manhasset Valley bridge, viewed from below]]\nThere is only one grade crossing, Little Neck Parkway at [[Little Neck (LIRR station)|Little Neck Station]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== 19th century ===\nThe Port Washington Branch was built by the [[Flushing Railroad]], in 1854 from [[Hunters Point, Queens|Hunters Point]] in [[Long Island City, NY|Long Island City]] to [[Flushing, NY|Flushing]], before the LIRR opened its line to Long Island City. It was the first non-LIRR line on Long Island. The company was reorganized in 1859 as the [[New York and Flushing Railroad]], and established a subsidiary known as the North Shore Railroad to extend the line from Flushing to [[Great Neck, NY|Great Neck]] in 1866. \n\nOriginally intending to run further east to [[Roslyn, NY|Roslyn]], [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]], and even [[Huntington (CDP), New York|Huntington]], the NY&F's plans were thwarted by the LIRR who reached those destination first, as well as poor service and competition with the 1868-established [[Flushing and North Side Railroad]]. In 1869, the [[New York State Legislature]] authorized the Flushing and North Side to buy the New York and Flushing east of the LIRR crossing at [[Winfield Junction (LIRR station)|Winfield Station]], while the segment between Hunters Point and Winfield was acquired by the [[South Side Railroad of Long Island]] until it was abandoned for passenger service east of what was to become the former [[Laurel Hill (LIRR station)|Laurel Hill Station]] in 1875.

This often causes slight delays during two-way rush hour operations. A second track cannot be added through Manhasset and Plandome due to the proximity of businesses to the narrow right-of-way in Manhasset, and the fact that the trestle between Great Neck and Manhasset (the Manhasset viaduct, constructed 1898) has only one track.<ref>[http://www.forgotten-ny.com/SUBWAYS/pwbranch2/LIRRmanhassetbridge1.jpg Image of single track across Manhasset Viaduct]</ref>\n\nTo reduce delays on the heavily used line, most peak-hour east-bound trains (weekday afternoons/evenings) are either local from Penn Station to [[Great Neck (LIRR station)|Great Neck]] (making all stops in between the two) or express from Penn Station to [[Port Washington (LIRR station)|Port Washington]] (making stops only at Great Neck, Manhasset, Plandome, and Port Washington, although some trains make their first stop at [[Bayside (LIRR station)|Bayside]]). A mix of local and express peak-hour trains go west on weekday mornings.\n\nExtra service is offered during the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] tennis tournament and for [[New York Mets]] home games, both of which are held in [[Flushing Meadows-Corona Park|Flushing Meadows\u2013Corona Park]]. These trains stop at a special [[Mets\u2013Willets Point (LIRR station)|Mets\u2013Willets Point]] station between Woodside and [[Flushing Main Street (LIRR station)|Flushing Main Street]].\n\nThe route also runs along a high train trestle over the marshes at the southern end of Manhasset Bay. The bridge stands {{convert|81|ft|m}} tall and runs {{convert|678|ft|m}} across the bay, offering a view of the Manhasset Bay. Scenes from the silent film serial \"The Perils of Pauline\" are said to have been shot on the trestle.<ref>[http://www.kingbridgeco.com/manhasset_viaduct.htm King Bridge Company] Manhasset viaduct</ref>\n\n[[File:Winfield Junction jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Winfield Junction]]\n[[File:Manhasset Valley trestle spruce jeh.jpg|thumb|left|Manhasset Valley bridge, viewed from East Shore Road]]\n[[File:Manhasset LIRR viaduct.jpg|thumb|left|Manhasset Valley bridge, viewed from below]]\nThere is only one grade crossing, Little Neck Parkway at [[Little Neck (LIRR station)|Little Neck Station]].\n\n==History==\n\n=== 19th century ===\nThe Port Washington Branch was built by the [[Flushing Railroad]], in 1854 from [[Hunters Point, Queens|Hunters Point]] in [[Long Island City, NY|Long Island City]] to [[Flushing, NY|Flushing]], before the LIRR opened its line to Long Island City. It was the first non-LIRR line on Long Island. The company was reorganized in 1859 as the [[New York and Flushing Railroad]], and established a subsidiary known as the North Shore Railroad to extend the line from Flushing to [[Great Neck, NY|Great Neck]] in 1866. \n\nOriginally intending to run further east to [[Roslyn, NY|Roslyn]], [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]], and even [[Huntington (CDP), New York|Huntington]], the NY&F's plans were thwarted by the LIRR who reached those destination first, as well as poor service and competition with the 1868-established [[Flushing and North Side Railroad]]. In 1869, the [[New York State Legislature]] authorized the Flushing and North Side to buy the New York and Flushing east of the LIRR crossing at [[Winfield Junction (LIRR station)|Winfield Station]], while the segment between Hunters Point and Winfield was acquired by the [[South Side Railroad of Long Island]] until it was abandoned for passenger service east of what was to become the former [[Laurel Hill (LIRR station)|Laurel Hill Station]] in 1875. Part of the right-of-way ran through what is today the [[Mount Zion Cemetery (New York City)|Mount Zion Jewish Cemetery]] in [[Maspeth, Queens|Maspeth]].<ref>[http://www.arrts-arrchives.com/images2/nyfrrbp1.jpg 1924 Long Island Railroad Corporate Blueprint (Arrt's Arrchives)]</ref> \n\nBy 1874, all branches of the Flushing and North Side Railroad, including the Main Line to Great Neck were incorporated into the '''Flushing, North Shore and Central Railroad''', which included the [[Central Railroad of Long Island]].

The branch splits from the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] just east of [[Hicksville (LIRR station)|Hicksville]] and runs northeast and east to [[Port Jefferson (LIRR station)|Port Jefferson]]. Several stations on the Main Line west of Hicksville are served primarily by trains bound to/from the Port Jefferson branch, so LIRR maps and schedules for the public include that part of the Main Line in the \"Port Jefferson Branch\" service.\n\nThe Port Jefferson Branch is one of the busiest branches of the LIRR, with frequent [[electric (rail)|electric]] service to [[Huntington (LIRR station)|Huntington]] where electrification ends, and diesel service east of Huntington continues to Port Jefferson. The MTA also refers to the line as the \"Huntington/Port Jefferson Branch\" or \"Huntington Branch\".\n\n==Service==\nPort Jefferson Branch service (as distinct from the piece of railroad called the Port Jefferson Branch) extends east from Floral Park, where the Hempstead Branch separates from the Main Line. The line west of Huntington is electrified and double tracked. Electrification extends to a point east of Huntington before [[Greenlawn (LIRR station)|Greenlawn]] station on a layup track for electric trains. East of there the line is single track with passing sidings at Greenlawn, east of [[Northport (LIRR station)|East Northport]], [[Kings Park (LIRR station)|Kings Park]], [[Smithtown (LIRR station)|Smithtown]] and [[Stony Brook (LIRR station)|Stony Brook]] allowing trains traveling in opposite directions to pass each other.\n\nElectric trains on the branch operate between Penn Station and Huntington, providing local service on the branch; additional weekday service operates between Penn Station and Hicksville. Trains to the [[Ronkonkoma Branch]] provide supplemental service; these usually run express, stopping only at Mineola and/or Hicksville. Additional service to Mineola is provided by [[Oyster Bay Branch]] trains, and a handful of [[Montauk Branch]] trains also stop at Mineola and Hicksville on weekdays; one [[Montauk (LIRR station)|Montauk]]-bound train makes a stop at Hicksville overnight, though the vast majority of [[Montauk Branch]] trains that run on the branch do not stop. Service on the unelectrified portion of the branch between Port Jefferson and Huntington is usually provided by diesel shuttles running between Port Jefferson and either Huntington or Hicksville, where customers transfer to electric trains for service to New York City. During rush hours, the branch sees extra service, including direct electric service to [[Atlantic Terminal]], service to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] that bypasses [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica]], and direct service to [[Hunterspoint Avenue (LIRR station)|Hunterspoint Avenue]], [[Long Island City (LIRR station)|Long Island City]], or Penn Station from stations east of Huntington.\n\nStations on the electrified portion that have the heaviest traffic include [[Mineola (LIRR station)|Mineola]], [[Hicksville (LIRR station)|Hicksville]], and [[Huntington (LIRR station)|Huntington]]. On the non-electrified portion, the heaviest traffic tends to be to the Stony Brook station where [[Stony Brook University]] is located.\n\n==Infrastructure improvements==\n===New Electric Yard===\nThe branch has no yard to store electric trains; east of Huntington, a single layup track with room for three trainsets is used for storage. Because of this lack of space, electric trains must [[dead mileage|deadhead]] from as far away as the [[West Side Yard]] in [[Manhattan]], around {{convert|37|mi|km}} away from Huntington, for rush-hour service.\n\nConstruction of a new electric yard would rectify this issue and allow the LIRR to increase branch service when [[East Side Access]] is completed and service to [[Grand Central Terminal]] begins. In the early 2000s, the MTA performed [[Environmental Impact Statement|environmental studies]] evaluating over a dozen sites between [[Huntington (LIRR station)|Huntington]] and [[Smithtown (LIRR station)|Smithtown]] for usage as a yard.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20051219110814/http://www.mta.info/mta/planning/portj/scope.pdf</ref> Electrification of the line would have to be extended if a site beyond Huntington was chosen; a site near Huntington would eliminate this need. Communities near the sites opposed the MTA's efforts to advance work on a new yard, arguing that the MTA was too secretive and that the increased train service and train movements would hurt their communities and decrease their quality of life. One commenter asserted that a yard would turn the communities along the line into the MTA's \"storage closet\" for [[East Side Access]]. Some opponents of the plan also argued that the MTA should extend electrification to Port Jefferson to utilize the existing diesel rail yard there, but a full electrification of the line would add more expenses to the project.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/27/nyregion/lirr-expansion-the-other-shoe-drops.html?pagewanted=all|title=L.I.R.R.

For 15 years from Amott Interlocking east of Syosset Station to west of Huntington it was single-tracked. In 1985, the LIRR constructed a second electrified track in that area to avoid the single track bottle neck, this included Cold Spring Harbor adding a second platform.\n\n===Electrification===\nIn 1970, [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] was extended from [[Mineola (LIRR station)|Mineola]] to [[Huntington (LIRR station)|Huntington]], the eastern limit of electrification on the branch. Since then, the LIRR has aspired to extend electrification beyond Huntington. In the 1980s, the railroad prepared to extend electrification to at least [[Northport (LIRR station)|Northport]], or [[Smithtown (LIRR station)|Smithtown]], although electrification of the [[Ronkonkoma Branch]] on the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] was seen as a higher priority, in part because the Main Line's central location in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] would benefit a larger number of people.\n\nIn December 1983, the LIRR announced that it was taking steps in the electrification of the branch, with the first step being the addition of a second electrified track between Huntington and Syosset. The second built along the south side of the existing track.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/02/nyregion/l-letters-to-the-long-island-editor-lirr-s-plans-for-electrification-165060.html|title=Letters to the Long Island Editor; L.I.R.R.'s Plans For Electrification|last=|first=|date=September 2, 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 27, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The second track was expected to be open in 1986. In August 1983, [[Long Island Lighting Company]] started relocating its power line along the right-of-way between these points. The following month a contract to prepare the site and to construct the roadbed for the track was awarded for $9.5 million. In December 1983, grading and construction work was expected to begin that month, and track installation was scheduled to be completed by the end of 1985. As part of the project, the {{Convert|800|feet|meters|abbr=}} south platform was to be extended to accommodate 12-car trains. The design of the project to Northport was completed, and preliminary designs were expected to be completed by early 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/04/nyregion/amount-of-lirr-fare-rise-weighed.html|title=Amount of L.I.R.R.

He argued that the limited funds the railroad had set aside for electrification would be better spent on other improvements, such as signal and [[West Side Yard|yard]] upgrades near Penn Station. Financial constraints acted as another obstacle to electrification to Northport.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/nyregion/pulling-the-plug-on-electrification.html|title=Pulling the Plug on Electrification|author=McQuiston|first=John T.|date=November 24, 1985|issn=0362-4331|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}</ref> McIver also did not want to electrify the branch in a piecemeal fashion and wanted to wait until the railroad had the funds to electrify from Huntington to Port Jefferson all at once. In anticipation of electrification, from late 1985 to early 1986, the LIRR built full-length high-level platforms at all stations between Huntington and Port Jefferson. Because electrification has not occurred, these 12-car platforms are unique in the LIRR's diesel territory; the high-level platforms along the [[Montauk Branch|Montauk]], [[Ronkonkoma Branch|Greenport]] and [[Oyster Bay Branch|Oyster Bay]] diesel branches are all much shorter. Work to install centralized traffic control between Smithtown and Port Jefferson started in fall 1974 and was completed in March 1975. This project was intended to improve safety and to increase train speed. The change allowed trains to run in more than one direction at a time in single-track territory with the use of passing sidings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://derekstadler.wordpress.com/portfolio-2/collections-photography/suffolk/port-jefferson-blues-the-smithtown-commuter-saga/|title=\"Port Jefferson Blues\": The Smithtown Commuter Saga|last=Stadler|first=Derek|date=August 16, 2016|website=Derek Stadler|language=en-US|access-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn June 9, 1986, the double-tracking of the line between Syosset and Huntington was completed, and seven additional trains were added to the schedule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/47232880031/in/dateposted-public/|title=Port Jefferson Branch Timetable Effective June 9, 1986|date=February 27, 2019|website=Flickr|publisher=Long Island Rail Road|access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref> The second track speeded some trips by up to 15 minutes.

The project took five years and cost $85 million. Work continued for a year to widen the overpass to allow for a future third track.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/nyregion/16-years-after-death-of-9-teen-agers-rail-bridge-opens.html|title=16 Years After Death of 9 Teen-Agers, Rail Bridge Opens|last=Draffen|first=Duayne|date=April 28, 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 8, 2015|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nOther crossings eliminated along the branch include Mineola Boulevard in Mineola (1930), crossings within Hicksville when the station was elevated in the early 1960s, and Charlotte Avenue in Hicksville (1973). Ten years later Roslyn Road also in Mineola was eliminated in the same fashion. Several hazardous crossings still exist west of Huntington, including Robbins Lane and Jackson Avenue in Syosset; School Street in Westbury; Willis Avenue and Main Street in Mineola; then New Hyde Park Road, and 12th Street in New Hyde Park.

On the weekend of July 20\u201321, 2019, the trestle that will carry the three tracks was installed at Urban Avenue. After construction of retaining walls, pedestrian walkway, and the repaving of the road, Urban Avenue was officially reopened on September 5, 2019. Covert Avenue underwent the installation of a three-track trestle on August 24\u201325 and reopened on October 12th, 2019.

[[New York (state)|New York]]. The branch splits from the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] just east of [[Hicksville (LIRR station)|Hicksville]] and runs northeast and east to [[Port Jefferson (LIRR station)|Port Jefferson]]. Several stations on the Main Line west of Hicksville are served primarily by trains bound to/from the Port Jefferson branch, so LIRR maps and schedules for the public include that part of the Main Line in the \"Port Jefferson Branch\" service.\n\nThe Port Jefferson Branch is one of the busiest branches of the LIRR, with frequent [[electric (rail)|electric]] service to [[Huntington (LIRR station)|Huntington]] where electrification ends, and diesel service east of Huntington continues to Port Jefferson. The MTA also refers to the line as the \"Huntington/Port Jefferson Branch\" or \"Huntington Branch\".\n\n==Service==\nPort Jefferson Branch service (as distinct from the piece of railroad called the Port Jefferson Branch) extends east from Floral Park, where the Hempstead Branch separates from the Main Line. The line west of Huntington is electrified and double tracked. Electrification extends to a point east of Huntington before [[Greenlawn (LIRR station)|Greenlawn]] station on a layup track for electric trains. East of there the line is single track with passing sidings at Greenlawn, east of [[Northport (LIRR station)|East Northport]], [[Kings Park (LIRR station)|Kings Park]], [[Smithtown (LIRR station)|Smithtown]] and [[Stony Brook (LIRR station)|Stony Brook]] allowing trains traveling in opposite directions to pass each other.\n\nElectric trains on the branch operate between Penn Station and Huntington, providing local service on the branch; additional weekday service operates between Penn Station and Hicksville. Trains to the [[Ronkonkoma Branch]] provide supplemental service; these usually run express, stopping only at Mineola and/or Hicksville. Additional service to Mineola is provided by [[Oyster Bay Branch]] trains, and a handful of [[Montauk Branch]] trains also stop at Mineola and Hicksville on weekdays; one [[Montauk (LIRR station)|Montauk]]-bound train makes a stop at Hicksville overnight, though the vast majority of [[Montauk Branch]] trains that run on the branch do not stop. Service on the unelectrified portion of the branch between Port Jefferson and Huntington is usually provided by diesel shuttles running between Port Jefferson and either Huntington or Hicksville, where customers transfer to electric trains for service to New York City. During rush hours, the branch sees extra service, including direct electric service to [[Atlantic Terminal]], service to [[Pennsylvania Station (New York City)|Penn Station]] that bypasses [[Jamaica (LIRR station)|Jamaica]], and direct service to [[Hunterspoint Avenue (LIRR station)|Hunterspoint Avenue]], [[Long Island City (LIRR station)|Long Island City]], or Penn Station from stations east of Huntington.\n\nStations on the electrified portion that have the heaviest traffic include [[Mineola (LIRR station)|Mineola]], [[Hicksville (LIRR station)|Hicksville]], and [[Huntington (LIRR station)|Huntington]]. On the non-electrified portion, the heaviest traffic tends to be to the Stony Brook station where [[Stony Brook University]] is located.\n\n==Infrastructure improvements==\n===New Electric Yard===\nThe branch has no yard to store electric trains; east of Huntington, a single layup track with room for three trainsets is used for storage. Because of this lack of space, electric trains must [[dead mileage|deadhead]] from as far away as the [[West Side Yard]] in [[Manhattan]], around {{convert|37|mi|km}} away from Huntington, for rush-hour service.\n\nConstruction of a new electric yard would rectify this issue and allow the LIRR to increase branch service when [[East Side Access]] is completed and service to [[Grand Central Terminal]] begins. In the early 2000s, the MTA performed [[Environmental Impact Statement|environmental studies]] evaluating over a dozen sites between [[Huntington (LIRR station)|Huntington]] and [[Smithtown (LIRR station)|Smithtown]] for usage as a yard.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20051219110814/http://www.mta.info/mta/planning/portj/scope.pdf</ref> Electrification of the line would have to be extended if a site beyond Huntington was chosen; a site near Huntington would eliminate this need. Communities near the sites opposed the MTA's efforts to advance work on a new yard, arguing that the MTA was too secretive and that the increased train service and train movements would hurt their communities and decrease their quality of life. One commenter asserted that a yard would turn the communities along the line into the MTA's \"storage closet\" for [[East Side Access]]. Some opponents of the plan also argued that the MTA should extend electrification to Port Jefferson to utilize the existing diesel rail yard there, but a full electrification of the line would add more expenses to the project.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/27/nyregion/lirr-expansion-the-other-shoe-drops.html?pagewanted=all|title=L.I.R.R.

For 15 years from Amott Interlocking east of Syosset Station to west of Huntington it was single-tracked. In 1985, the LIRR constructed a second electrified track in that area to avoid the single track bottle neck, this included Cold Spring Harbor adding a second platform.\n\n===Electrification===\nIn 1970, [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] was extended from [[Mineola (LIRR station)|Mineola]] to [[Huntington (LIRR station)|Huntington]], the eastern limit of electrification on the branch. Since then, the LIRR has aspired to extend electrification beyond Huntington. In the 1980s, the railroad prepared to extend electrification to at least [[Northport (LIRR station)|Northport]], or [[Smithtown (LIRR station)|Smithtown]], although electrification of the [[Ronkonkoma Branch]] on the [[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]] was seen as a higher priority, in part because the Main Line's central location in [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]] would benefit a larger number of people.\n\nIn December 1983, the LIRR announced that it was taking steps in the electrification of the branch, with the first step being the addition of a second electrified track between Huntington and Syosset. The second built along the south side of the existing track.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/09/02/nyregion/l-letters-to-the-long-island-editor-lirr-s-plans-for-electrification-165060.html|title=Letters to the Long Island Editor; L.I.R.R.'s Plans For Electrification|last=|first=|date=September 2, 1984|work=The New York Times|access-date=February 27, 2019|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref> The second track was expected to be open in 1986. In August 1983, [[Long Island Lighting Company]] started relocating its power line along the right-of-way between these points. The following month a contract to prepare the site and to construct the roadbed for the track was awarded for $9.5 million. In December 1983, grading and construction work was expected to begin that month, and track installation was scheduled to be completed by the end of 1985. As part of the project, the {{Convert|800|feet|meters|abbr=}} south platform was to be extended to accommodate 12-car trains. The design of the project to Northport was completed, and preliminary designs were expected to be completed by early 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/04/nyregion/amount-of-lirr-fare-rise-weighed.html|title=Amount of L.I.R.R.

He argued that the limited funds the railroad had set aside for electrification would be better spent on other improvements, such as signal and [[West Side Yard|yard]] upgrades near Penn Station. Financial constraints acted as another obstacle to electrification to Northport.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/11/24/nyregion/pulling-the-plug-on-electrification.html|title=Pulling the Plug on Electrification|author=McQuiston|first=John T.|date=November 24, 1985|issn=0362-4331|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=January 5, 2016}}</ref> McIver also did not want to electrify the branch in a piecemeal fashion and wanted to wait until the railroad had the funds to electrify from Huntington to Port Jefferson all at once. In anticipation of electrification, from late 1985 to early 1986, the LIRR built full-length high-level platforms at all stations between Huntington and Port Jefferson. Because electrification has not occurred, these 12-car platforms are unique in the LIRR's diesel territory; the high-level platforms along the [[Montauk Branch|Montauk]], [[Ronkonkoma Branch|Greenport]] and [[Oyster Bay Branch|Oyster Bay]] diesel branches are all much shorter. Work to install centralized traffic control between Smithtown and Port Jefferson started in fall 1974 and was completed in March 1975. This project was intended to improve safety and to increase train speed. The change allowed trains to run in more than one direction at a time in single-track territory with the use of passing sidings.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://derekstadler.wordpress.com/portfolio-2/collections-photography/suffolk/port-jefferson-blues-the-smithtown-commuter-saga/|title=\"Port Jefferson Blues\": The Smithtown Commuter Saga|last=Stadler|first=Derek|date=August 16, 2016|website=Derek Stadler|language=en-US|access-date=May 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nOn June 9, 1986, the double-tracking of the line between Syosset and Huntington was completed, and seven additional trains were added to the schedule.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/127872292@N06/47232880031/in/dateposted-public/|title=Port Jefferson Branch Timetable Effective June 9, 1986|date=February 27, 2019|website=Flickr|publisher=Long Island Rail Road|access-date=February 27, 2019}}</ref> The second track speeded some trips by up to 15 minutes.

The project took five years and cost $85 million. Work continued for a year to widen the overpass to allow for a future third track.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/28/nyregion/16-years-after-death-of-9-teen-agers-rail-bridge-opens.html|title=16 Years After Death of 9 Teen-Agers, Rail Bridge Opens|last=Draffen|first=Duayne|date=April 28, 1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=May 8, 2015|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nOther crossings eliminated along the branch include Mineola Boulevard in Mineola (1930), crossings within Hicksville when the station was elevated in the early 1960s, and Charlotte Avenue in Hicksville (1973). Ten years later Roslyn Road also in Mineola was eliminated in the same fashion. Several hazardous crossings still exist west of Huntington, including Robbins Lane and Jackson Avenue in Syosset; School Street in Westbury; Willis Avenue and Main Street in Mineola; then New Hyde Park Road, and 12th Street in New Hyde Park. East of Huntington, [[New York State Route 25A|Main Street]] in Port Jefferson is considered quite hazardous.\n\nThe Third Track project is expected to close seven grade crossings, namely those in Westbury, Mineola, and New Hyde Park.<ref>{{cite web | title=Long Island's & NYC's News Source - Newsday | website=Newsday | url=https://www.newsday.com/long-island/transportation/lirr-third-track-1.19363853 | access-date=April 21, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=Governor Cuomo Announces Groundbreaking of Historic Long Island Rail Road Third Track | website=Governor Andrew M.
