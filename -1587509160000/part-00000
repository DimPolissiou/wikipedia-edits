The landing team also finds the mysterious cylinder device. [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)|Sharon \"Athena\" Agathon]] tries to access the Basestar's computer system to no avail.  She then speaks with a Cylon copy of herself who calls her a traitor. Apollo requests permission to finish off the Cylons.  However, at [[Karl Agathon|Captain Helo's]] suggestion, [[William Adama|Admiral Adama]] orders the prisoners to be brought back to ''Galactica'' for interrogation.\n\n[[Gaius Baltar]] is confronted by [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Three]] and [[Number Six (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Six]], who ask why he didn't reveal the existence of the device he found on the Basestar. Baltar feigns ignorance at first but then confesses that he did know about the device.  Three and Six believe that he knows more about the device that he's letting on. They have two Centurions take him away for interrogation.\n\nThe Cylon prisoners, along with Apollo's boarding party, are placed under quarantine by [[Doctor Cottle]]. Later, he determines the virus to be a strain of [[Encephalitis|Lymphocytic Encephalitis]], one that has caused the Cylon's brains to swell and other symptoms like high fever, stupor, and disorientation.\n\nCottle reports to Adama and [[Laura Roslin|President Roslin]] that he can create a serum that will suppress the virus and keep the Cylons alive, without ever curing them; the Cylons will have to be given periodic injections to keep them alive.  A Cylon copy of [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Simon]] is brought before Adama and Roslin. In exchange for the serum, Simon explains the Cylons' plans to find Earth. He reveals that Baltar is with the Cylon fleet and is showing them the way to Earth. Simon further explains about the probe, and how the contaminated Basestar was abandoned by the rest of the Cylon fleet.\n\nApollo realizes that the human race now has a way to exterminate the Cylons once and for all. All they need do is execute their Cylon prisoners within range of a Cylon Resurrection Ship. Captain Helo objects to this plan, arguing that exterminating an entire race would be a \"crime against humanity\" and make the humans no better than the Cylons. Apollo argues that the Cylons are not human and they should be wiped out. Helo retorts saying that [[Number Eight (Battlestar Galactica)#Sharon .22Athena.22 Agathon|Sharon (\"Athena\")]], his wife and a Galactica officer, has proved her loyalty, risking her neck time and again to help the human survivors and believes there may be more Cylons that think as she does.\n\nAdama meets with Roslin on ''Colonial One'' to discuss the proposal to wipe out the Cylons. Roslin is in favor of the plan, but Adama is uneasy, pointing out that he needs a Presidential Order to use biological weapons. Roslin sees through this as Adama's way of \"passing the buck\", a point that Adama readily concedes. Roslin takes the responsibility, and orders Adama to carry out the plan to destroy the Cylons with the virus.\n\nBaltar continues to be tortured by Number Three who demands he tell her what he knows. Gaius's mind, however, drifts in and out between the torture room and the beach with Six, who begins to make love to him. In between intense pain and erotic pleasure, Baltar talks of religion and faith, a monologue that makes little sense to Three because Gaius is actually talking to the Six in his head. He tells Six he loves her but Three doesn't realize who he is talking to, and she ends the torture with a look of pity on her face.\n\nGalactica jumps away from the Colonial fleet and appears in a location within the Cylons' detection range. A Cylon fleet, complete with Resurrection Ship, duly appears. Adama orders Apollo to execute the Cylon prisoners, but when Apollo arrives at their cell, he discovers that the Cylons are already dead. Adama immediately recalls the Galactica's fighters and the Galactica jumps away.\n\nThe Cylons were in fact killed by Helo, who had secretly sabotaged the air handlers to remove the oxygen from their cell. Expecting to be arrested at any moment, Helo confesses his actions to Athena. He tells Athena that he believes he has made the right decision. However, the dreaded knock at the door of his quarters never comes. \n\nAdama tells Roslin that the Cylons were killed before they had a chance to download to the Resurrection Ship, and that the plan to infect the Cylons with the virus has failed. Roslin believes there are only two possible suspects and asks what Adama is going to do about an investigation.  Adama believes the device was a marker, and that they are definitely on the right track to finding Earth. Roslin agrees with this, but points out that if the humans are on the right track to Earth, then the Cylons must be too.\n\n==Emmy Award consideration==\n[[James Callis]] submitted this episode for consideration in the category of \"[[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor - Drama Series|Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Drama Series]]\" on his behalf for the [[59th Primetime Emmy Awards|2007 Emmy Awards]].<ref name=\"EMMY07\">{{cite web|title=2007 Emmys CONFIRMED Episode Submissions |url=http://goldderbyforums.latimes.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/1106078764/m/53610293 |publisher=The Envelope Forum, [[Los Angeles Times]] |accessdate=2007-06-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626120429/http://goldderbyforums.latimes.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/1106078764/m/53610293 |archivedate=26 June 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [[BattlestarWiki:A Measure of Salvation|\"A Measure of Salvation\"]] at the Battlestar Wiki\n* [http://www.syfy.com/battlestar/episodes/season/3/episode/307/a_measure_of_salvation \"A Measure of Salvation\"] at [[Syfy|Syfy.com]]\n* {{IMDb episode|0870871}}\n* {{tv.com episode|battlestar-galactica/a-measure-of-salvation-2-822590}}\n\n{{Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Measure Of Salvation, A}}\n[[Category:2006 American television episodes]]\n[[Category:Battlestar Galactica (season 3) episodes]]\n\n[[fr:Saison 3 de Battlestar Galactica#La Balise]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox television episode\n| title = A Measure of Salvation\n| image = BattlestarGalactica -- 3x07 - A Measure of Salvation.jpg\n| image_size = 250px\n| caption = One of ''Galactica'''s prisoners, a Leoben Conoy model, lies dead in his holding cell.\n| series = Battlestar Galactica\n| season = 3\n| episode = 7\n| airdate = November 10, 2006\n| production =\n| writer = [[Michael Angeli]]\n| guests = \n*[[Lucy Lawless]] as [[Number Three (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Three]]\n*[[Rick Worthy]] as [[Number Four (Battlestar Galactica)|Simon]]\n*[[Callum Keith Rennie]] as [[Leoben Conoy]]\n*[[Matthew Bennett]] as [[Number Five (Battlestar Galactica)|Number Five]]\n*[[Luciana Carro]] as [[Louanne Katraine|Louanne \"Kat\" Katraine]]\n*[[Donnelly Rhodes]] as [[Sherman Cottle|Cottle]]\n*[[Bodie Olmos]] as [[List of Battlestar Galactica characters#Hot Dog|Hot Dog]] \n*[[Leah Cairns]] as [[Margaret Edmonson|Margaret \"Racetrack\" Edmondson]]\n| director = [[Bill Eagles]]\n| season_article = Battlestar Galactica (season 3)\n| episode_list = List of Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series) episodes\n| prev = [[Torn (Battlestar Galactica)|Torn]]\n| next = [[Hero (Battlestar Galactica)|Hero]] \n}}\n\"'''A Measure of Salvation'''\" is the seventh episode of the third season from the science fiction television series ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Lee Adama|Major Apollo]] leads a boarding team inside the ship finding most of the Cylons are dead, however, a small group is found barely alive on the bridge.

It borders [[Slovenia]] to the northwest, [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, sharing a [[maritime border]] with [[Italy]]. Its capital, [[Zagreb]], forms one of the country's [[administrative divisions of Croatia|primary subdivisions]], along with [[twenty counties]]. Croatia has an area of {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and a population of 4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Roman Catholics]].\n\nCroatia has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Age]]. The [[Croats]] arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into [[Duchy of Croatia|two duchies]] by the 9th century. Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]]. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|kingdom]], which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended, Croatia [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|entered]] a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]], the Croatian Parliament elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, in the final days of [[World War I]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 it was [[Creation of Yugoslavia|merged into]] the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]<ref name=\"Stuart Foster and Keith Crawford, \u2018Introduction: The Critical Importance of History Textbook Research\u2019, in: What Shall We Tell the Children? : International Perspectives on School History Textbooks, eds.

In response,  a [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia|resistance movement]] developed. This led to the creation of the [[Federal State of Croatia]], which after the war became a founding member and constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 25 June 1991, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]], which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully for four years following the declaration.\n\nA [[sovereign state]], Croatia is a [[republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2008\u20132009 term. Since 2000, the [[Croatian government]] has constantly invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]].\n\nCroatia is classified by the World Bank as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] country and ranked 46th on the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2019 |publisher=UNDP|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref> The [[Croatia's economy|economy]] is dominated by [[service sector|service]], [[industrial sector]]s and agriculture.

It borders [[Slovenia]] to the northwest, [[Hungary]] to the northeast, [[Serbia]] to the east, [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, sharing a [[maritime border]] with [[Italy]]. Its capital, [[Zagreb]], forms one of the country's [[administrative divisions of Croatia|primary subdivisions]], along with [[twenty counties]]. Croatia has an area of {{convert|56594|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=off}} and a population of 4.28&nbsp;million, most of whom are [[Roman Catholics]].\n\nCroatia has been inhabited since the [[Paleolithic Age]]. The [[Croats]] arrived in the area in the 6th century and organised the territory into [[Duchy of Croatia|two duchies]] by the 9th century. Croatia was first internationally recognized as an independent state on 7 June 879 during the reign of duke [[Branimir of Croatia|Branimir]]. [[Tomislav of Croatia|Tomislav]] became the first king by 925, elevating Croatia to the status of a [[Kingdom of Croatia (925\u20131102)|kingdom]], which retained its sovereignty for nearly two centuries. During the succession crisis after the Trpimirovi\u0107 dynasty ended, Croatia [[Croatia in the union with Hungary|entered]] a [[personal union]] with [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]] in 1102. In 1527, faced with [[Hundred Years' Croatian\u2013Ottoman War|Ottoman conquest]], the Croatian Parliament elected [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I of Austria]] to the Croatian throne. In October 1918, in the final days of [[World War I]], the [[State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs]], independent from Austria-Hungary, was proclaimed in Zagreb, and in December 1918 it was [[Creation of Yugoslavia|merged into]] the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]<ref name=\"Stuart Foster and Keith Crawford, \u2018Introduction: The Critical Importance of History Textbook Research\u2019, in: What Shall We Tell the Children? : International Perspectives on School History Textbooks, eds.

In response,  a [[National Liberation Movement in Croatia|resistance movement]] developed. This led to the creation of the [[Federal State of Croatia]], which after the war became a founding member and constituent of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]]. On 25 June 1991, Croatia [[Independence of Croatia|declared independence]], which came wholly into effect on 8 October of the same year. The [[Croatian War of Independence]] was fought successfully for four years following the declaration.\n\nA [[sovereign state]], Croatia is a [[republic]] governed under a [[parliamentary system]]. It is a member of the [[European Union]] (EU), the [[United Nations]] (UN), the [[Council of Europe]], [[NATO]], the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO), and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean]]. As an active participant in the [[UN peacekeeping forces]], Croatia has contributed troops to the [[NATO-led mission in Afghanistan]] and took a non-permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]] for the 2008\u20132009 term. Since 2000, the [[Croatian government]] has constantly invested in infrastructure, especially [[Transport in Croatia|transport routes and facilities]] along the [[Pan-European corridors]].\n\nCroatia is classified by the World Bank as a [[World Bank high-income economy|high-income]] country and ranked 46th on the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|Human Development Index]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/hdr2019.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2019 |publisher=UNDP|accessdate=1 October 2019}}</ref> The [[Croatia's economy|economy]] is dominated by [[service sector|service]], [[industrial sector]]s and agriculture.

The film stars [[Salman Khan]], [[Ayesha Takia]], [[Prakash Raj]], [[Vinod Khanna]] and [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] in the lead roles. The film was released on September 18, 2009 and is an official remake of the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film  ''[[Pokiri]]'', which was remade in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[Pokkiri]]'' by Deva in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nRadhe ([[Salman Khan]]), a gangster with a mysterious past, kills others for money. He meets Jhanvi ([[Ayesha Takia]]) while she's doing fitness training and instantly falls in love with her. Even though their first meeting leads Jhanvi to think negatively about Radhe, she later begins to reciprocate his feelings. However, Talpade ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]), a selfish and perverted Inspector, lusts after Jhanvi and tells her to marry him with the threat that he would rape Jhanvi's mother ([[Prateeksha Lonkar]]) if she decides to go against his decision. Talpade is tipped off about Radhe's existence by Jhanvi's landlord. He tries to threaten Radhe but ends up getting frightened of him after getting outsmarted by him.\n\nGani Bhai ([[Prakash Raj]]), an international don, arrives in India for assassination and hires Radhe. Gani Bhai operates his gang from outside of India. Golden Bhai ([[Aseem Merchant]]) is the gang leader of Gani Bhai's gang. Two gangs, Datta Pawle's ([[Raju Mavani]]) and Gani Bhai's, fight for the biggest part of Mumbai. Due to this, Commissioner Ashraf Taufiq Khan ([[Govind Namdeo]]) decides to make Mumbai free of crime. He arrests Gani Bhai, who makes various attempts to contact Radhe, however, in vain. Ashraf is blackmailed to release Gani Bhai after his men release an explicit video of his daughter online after kidnapping her. Under the influence of drugs, his daughter reveals a mission that involves an IPS officer, Rajveer Singh Shekhawat, murdering Gani Bhai. Since Rajveer Shekhawat's identity is difficult to decipher, Gani Bhai holds his father, Shrikant Shekhawat ([[Vinod Khanna]]), captive. Shrikant proudly tells him about his son, without revealing his true identity. Gani Bhai mistakes Ajay ([[Inder Kumar]]), Rajveer's adopted brother, for Rajveer Shekhawat and kills him. Gani Bhai realises his mistake and pressures Shrikant to reveal Rajveer's identity. Shrikant is murdered by Gani Bhai after he refuses to tell him. His son, Rajveer Shekhawat, who is revealed to be Radhe, arrives at the place of his father's death. Radhe is infuriated and decides to avenge the deaths of his father and brother. Through threatening Talpade, he locates Gani Bhai. After intense combat, Radhe finally manages to kill Gani Bhai and his co-conspirator Talpade.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Salman Khan]] as IPS Rajveer Shekhawat/[[Radhe]]\n* [[Vinod Khanna]] as Shrikant Shekhawat, Radhe's father\n* [[Inder Kumar]] as Ajay Shekhawat\n* [[Ayesha Takia]] as Jhanvi, Radhe's love interest\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Shamsuddin Ashgar Ghani or Ghani Bhai\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Inspector Talpade\n* [[Mahek Chahal]] as Shaina\n* [[Govind Namdeo]] as Police Commissioner Ashraf Khan\n* [[Aseem Merchant]] as Golden Bhai\n* Hary Josh as Jankiz, Golden Bhai's henchman\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Sonu Gates\n* [[Sarfaraz Khan (actor)|Sarfaraz Khan]] as Aslam, Radhe's friend\n* [[Sajid-Wajid|Sajid Ali]] (Sajid-Wajid) as Radhe's friend\n* [[Raju Mavani]] as Datta Pawle, who plans to kill the local MLA\n* [[G.

The film stars [[Salman Khan]], [[Ayesha Takia]], [[Prakash Raj]], [[Vinod Khanna]] and [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] in the lead roles. The film was released on September 18, 2009 and is an official remake of the [[Telugu language|Telugu]] film  ''[[Pokiri]]'', which was remade in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] as ''[[Pokkiri]]'' by Deva in 2007.\n\n==Plot==\nRadhe ([[Salman Khan]]), a gangster with a mysterious past, kills others for money. He meets Jhanvi ([[Ayesha Takia]]) while she's doing fitness training and instantly falls in love with her. Even though their first meeting leads Jhanvi to think negatively about Radhe, she later begins to reciprocate his feelings. However, Talpade ([[Mahesh Manjrekar]]), a selfish and perverted Inspector, lusts after Jhanvi and tells her to marry him with the threat that he would rape Jhanvi's mother ([[Prateeksha Lonkar]]) if she decides to go against his decision. Talpade is tipped off about Radhe's existence by Jhanvi's landlord. He tries to threaten Radhe but ends up getting frightened of him after getting outsmarted by him.\n\nGani Bhai ([[Prakash Raj]]), an international don, arrives in India for assassination and hires Radhe. Gani Bhai operates his gang from outside of India. Golden Bhai ([[Aseem Merchant]]) is the gang leader of Gani Bhai's gang. Two gangs, Datta Pawle's ([[Raju Mavani]]) and Gani Bhai's, fight for the biggest part of Mumbai. Due to this, Commissioner Ashraf Taufiq Khan ([[Govind Namdeo]]) decides to make Mumbai free of crime. He arrests Gani Bhai, who makes various attempts to contact Radhe, however, in vain. Ashraf is blackmailed to release Gani Bhai after his men release an explicit video of his daughter online after kidnapping her. Under the influence of drugs, his daughter reveals a mission that involves an IPS officer, Rajveer Singh Shekhawat, murdering Gani Bhai. Since Rajveer Shekhawat's identity is difficult to decipher, Gani Bhai holds his father, Shrikant Shekhawat ([[Vinod Khanna]]), captive. Shrikant proudly tells him about his son, without revealing his true identity. Gani Bhai mistakes Ajay ([[Inder Kumar]]), Rajveer's adopted brother, for Rajveer Shekhawat and kills him. Gani Bhai realises his mistake and pressures Shrikant to reveal Rajveer's identity. Shrikant is murdered by Gani Bhai after he refuses to tell him. His son, Rajveer Shekhawat, who is revealed to be Radhe, arrives at the place of his father's death. Radhe is infuriated and decides to avenge the deaths of his father and brother. Through threatening Talpade, he locates Gani Bhai. After intense combat, Radhe finally manages to kill Gani Bhai and his co-conspirator Talpade.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Salman Khan]] as IPS Rajveer Shekhawat/[[Radhe]]\n* [[Vinod Khanna]] as Shrikant Shekhawat, Radhe's father\n* [[Inder Kumar]] as Ajay Shekhawat\n* [[Ayesha Takia]] as Jhanvi, Radhe's love interest\n* [[Prakash Raj]] as Shamsuddin Ashgar Ghani or Ghani Bhai\n* [[Mahesh Manjrekar]] as Inspector Talpade\n* [[Mahek Chahal]] as Shaina\n* [[Govind Namdeo]] as Police Commissioner Ashraf Khan\n* [[Aseem Merchant]] as Golden Bhai\n* Hary Josh as Jankiz, Golden Bhai's henchman\n* [[Manoj Pahwa]] as Sonu Gates\n* [[Sarfaraz Khan (actor)|Sarfaraz Khan]] as Aslam, Radhe's friend\n* [[Sajid-Wajid|Sajid Ali]] (Sajid-Wajid) as Radhe's friend\n* [[Raju Mavani]] as Datta Pawle, who plans to kill the local MLA\n* [[G.

He was questioned about the investigation into his father's disappearance, which had taken place on the morning of Sunday, June 24, 1855. Newsom described how, after he had joined the search party, \"some bones were found a short distance from [Celia's] cabin along a path,\" and how he and his sister, Virginia Wainscott had collected the bone fragments they had found in a box, which they then left with \"Mr. Bentley, the circuit court clerk.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Trial Testimony of Harry Newsom|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/celia/newsomtranscript.html|accessdate=21 November 2016|date=10 October 1855}}</ref>\n\n===Virginia Wainscott===\nNext the prosecution called Virginia Wainscott, Robert Newsom's oldest daughter, to the stand. When questioned about the investigation into her father's disappearance, Wainscott described how she had \"hunted on all of the paths and walks and every place for him\" before she \"learned where the bones were put\" on the evening of June 24, 1855.

He testified that had been \"up in the cherry tree early in the morning grandpa was missing,\" and that Celia had offered him \"two dozen walnuts\" if he would carry the ashes out of her cabin. Coffee testified that he had agreed to Celia's offer and taken the ashes and spread them along the side of the path, where he later witnessed the search party \"picking bones up out of the ashes.\"<ref name=\"Coffee Testimony\" /> In their cross-examination of Coffee Wainscott, the defense questioned him about his grandfather's sleeping arrangements on the night of his murder, much like they had questioned his mother, Virginia Wainscott. Coffee provided the defense with little information, other than the fact that his four-year-old brother, Billy, had been sleeping in the same room as their grandfather that night.<ref name=\"Coffee Testimony\" />\n\n===William Powell===\nNext, the prosecution called Robert Newsom's neighbor William Powell to the stand. Powell had led the investigation into Newsom's disappearance, and, when questioned by the prosecution, he simply recounted how and where Newsom's bones had been discovered by the search party.<ref name=\"TRIAL TESTIMONY WILLIAM POWELL\" /> In their cross-examination of William Powell, Celia's defense team questioned him about his interrogation with Celia on the day of the investigation, June 23, 1855.<ref name=\"William Powell Statement\" /> Powell revealed in his testimony that Celia had only confessed to Newsom's murder after he had threatened her repeatedly, telling her \"that it would be better for her to tell - that her children would not be taken away from her if she would tell, and that [he] had rope fashioned for her if she would not tell.\"<ref name=\"TRIAL TESTIMONY WILLIAM POWELL\">{{cite web|title=Trial Testimony of William Powell|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/celia/powelltranscript.html|accessdate=21 November 2016|date=10 October 1855}}</ref> He also testified that Celia had told him that she had \"threatened to hurt him [Newsom] if he did not quit forcing her while she was sick\" and that \"she did not want to kill him, struck him but did not want to kill him.\"<ref name=\"TRIAL TESTIMONY WILLIAM POWELL\" />\n\n===Dr. Smith and Dr. Young===\nFinally, the prosecution called Dr. Smith and Dr. Young to the stand to examine the bones that had been collected from the ashes in and around Celia's cabin.

Martin, a physician. The defense posed to Dr. Martin a series of questions designed to establish doubt in the minds of the jurors that Celia, unassisted, could have killed Newsom and disposed of his body in the manner described by the prosecution. The defense asked: \"Could the body of a human being be destroyed by burning in a common fireplace from 10 o'clock pm to 4 o'clock am?\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Trial Testimony of Dr. James Martin|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/celia/martintranscript.html|accessdate=21 November 2016|date=10 October 1855}}</ref> The prosecution objected to this question, and Judge Hall sustained the objection. Twice the defense attempted to rephrase the question, but the prosecution objected each time, and Judge Hall sustained each objection, forcing the defense to abandon this line of questioning.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaurin|title=Celia, a Slave: A True Story|url=https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla|url-access=registration|date=1991|pages=[https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla/page/100 100]\u2013101}}</ref>\n\n===Thomas Shoatman===\nNext the defense called Thomas Shoatman to the stand. Shoatman had been present when Celia had been questioned by Jefferson Jones in July, after her arrest. The defense questioned Shoatman about the reasons Celia had given for striking Newsom the first and second times. Shoatman testified that Celia had said that she struck Newsom the first time \"only to hurt him, to keep him from having sexual intercourse with her\" (although the phrase \"to keep him from having sexual intercourse with her\" was stricken from the record after an objection from the prosecution),<ref name=\"McLaurin - SHOATMAN\">{{cite book|last1=McLaurin|title=Celia, a Slave: A True Story|url=https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla|url-access=registration|date=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla/page/101 101]}}</ref> and that she had struck the second blow because \"he threw his hands up, that she was afraid he would catch her.\"<ref name=\"Shoatman Trial Testimony\">{{cite web|title=Trial Testimony of Thomas Shoatman|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/celia/shoatmantranscript.html|accessdate=21 November 2016|date=10 October 1855}}</ref> With Thomas Shoatman's testimony, the defense attempted to convince the jurors that Celia had been acting in self-defense when she had killed Newsom.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaurin|title=Celia, a Slave: A True Story|url=https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla|url-access=registration|date=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla/page/102 102]}}</ref>\n\n==Decision==\n\n===Jury Instructions===\nBoth the defense and the prosecution were allowed to submit proposed jury instructions to Judge Hall, which he could choose to either accept or reject.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaurin|title=Celia, a Slave: A True Story|url=https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla|url-access=registration|date=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla/page/n119 104]}}</ref> Celia's defense team submitted several instructions to Judge Hall requesting that the jury acquit Celia if they believed that she had been justifiably resisting sexual assault when she had killed Robert Newsom.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaurin|title=Celia, a Slave: A True Story|url=https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla|url-access=registration|date=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla/page/n121 106]}}</ref> In the state of Missouri, at the time of Celia's trial, it was a crime \"to take any woman unlawfully against her will and by force, menace or duress, compel her to be defiled,\" and resistance of such an offense would have been considered a justifiable excuse for a woman to kill a man. The defense requested that the jury be instructed that the words \"any woman\" included enslaved women, and that Celia should not be convicted if they believed that she had been attempting to resist rape when she had killed Newsom.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaurin|title=Celia, a Slave: A True Story|url=https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla|url-access=registration|date=1991|pages=[https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla/page/n122 107]\u2013108}}</ref> Judge Hall did not accept these proposed instructions, and they were not delivered to the jury. The instructions that were actually given to the jury did not address the motive for Celia's crime at all, or allow for an acquittal based on the idea that she would have been justified in using physical force to resist sexual assault at the hands of her master.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaurin|title=Celia, a Slave: A True Story|url=https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla|url-access=registration|date=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla/page/n125 110]}}</ref>\n\n===Verdict===\nOn October 10, 1855, the jury found Celia guilty of murder in the first degree.<ref name=\"Verdict\" />\n\n===Aftermath===\nThe day after the jury reached their verdict, Celia's defense team requested that the court \"set aside the verdict of the jury...and grant a new trial.\"<ref name=\"motion to grant new trial\">{{cite web|title=Motion to Set Aside Verdict and Grant New Trial|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/celia/newtrialmotion.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2016|date=11 October 1855}}</ref> Judge Hall denied their request and sentenced Celia to be \"hanged by the neck until dead on the sixteenth day of November 1855.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaurin|title=Celia, a Slave: A True Story|url=https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla|url-access=registration|date=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla/page/n135 120]}}</ref> Celia's defense team then requested for an appeal to be heard by the Supreme Court of Missouri.

After her return, Celia's defense team wrote a letter to Judge Abiel Leonard of the Supreme Court of Missouri, explaining that Celia had been \"taken out by someone\" and that they felt \"more than ordinary interest in behalf of the girl Celia, believing that she did the act (of slaying Newsom) to prevent a forced sexual assault.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaurin|title=Celia, a Slave: A True Story|url=https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla|url-access=registration|date=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla/page/n139 124]}}</ref> They also included a record of Celia's case, which they asked the Supreme Court to review, and requested that a stay of execution order be issued to ensure that Celia would not be executed before the Supreme Court had a chance to review her case.<ref>{{cite book|last1=McLaurin|title=Celia, a Slave: A True Story|url=https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla|url-access=registration|date=1991|page=[https://archive.org/details/celiaslave00mcla/page/n140 125]}}</ref> The Supreme Court responded on December 14, 1855, stating \"upon an examination of the record and proceedings of the Circuit Court of Callaway County in the above case, it is thought proper to refuse the prayer of the petitioner...It is therefore ordered by the Court, that an order for the Stay of the execution in this case be refused.\"<ref name=\"denying stay of execution\">{{cite web|title=Supreme Court order denying Celia's petition for a stay of execution pending appeal|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/celia/Stayofexecutiondenial.pdf|accessdate=22 November 2016|date=14 December 1855}}</ref>\n\nCelia was hanged on December 21, 1855, at 2:30&nbsp;p.m.<ref name=\"Hanging a Negress\">{{cite news|title=Hanging a Negress|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1856/01/16/76451883.pdf|accessdate=20 November 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=16 January 1856}}</ref>\n\n==Historical significance==\nCelia's trial took place at a time when slavery was an extremely contentious issue in America, and the verdict had important implications for the legal status of enslaved persons, particularly black women.

The character of Clark Kent, first created for [[comic book]]s by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] in 1938 as the alternate identity of [[Superman]], was adapted to television in 2001 by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]]. This is the fourth time the character has been adapted to a [[live-action]] television series. Clark Kent has been played continually by [[Tom Welling]], with various other actors portraying Clark as a child. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the ''Smallville'' series, all of which are completely independent of the television episodes. As of 2011, ''Smallville''{{'}}s Clark Kent has appeared in eighteen [[young adult novels]].\n\nIn the series, Clark Kent attempts to live the life of a normal human being, and struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In ''Smallville'', Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all of them at the start of the show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until [[Smallville (season 2)|season two]] and [[Smallville (season 6)|six]], respectively.\n\nWhen developing ''Smallville''{{'s}} version of Clark Kent, the producers decided to strip him down to the \"bare essence\" of Superman;<ref name=\"genesis\"/> he is also fallible, which allows the audience to see his humanity, but that he is also \"... good to the core\".<ref name=\"Core\"/> In the series, he has been seen by critics, and intentionally portrayed by the filmmakers, as a symbolic representation of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Tom Welling has been nominated for multiple [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice]] and [[Saturn Award]]s for his portrayal of Clark Kent since the show's [[Smallville (season 1)|first season]].\n\n==Role in ''Smallville''==\n[[Clark Kent]] first appears in the pilot episode of ''Smallville'' as a teen with superhuman abilities that he uses to help others. Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] and [[Annette O'Toole]]) as an infant, when he crash lands on Earth on the day of the Smallville meteor shower in 1989. Twelve years later, trying to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father, Clark saves the life of [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]), the son of billionaire [[Lionel Luthor]] ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]), and the pair become quick friends.<ref name=\"Pilot ep\">{{cite episode|title=Pilot|series=Smallville|credits=[[Alfred Gough]], [[Miles Millar]] (writers) & [[David Nutter]] (director)|network=The WB|airdate=October 16, 2001|season=1|number=1|minutes=42}}</ref> During season one, Clark struggles with the burden of keeping his powers a secret from those close to him.

When he asked about Welling, the casting director said Welling's manager did not want him to do the role because it could hurt his feature film career. After a conversation with Welling's manager, Nutter got Welling to read the script for the pilot, which convinced him to do the part.<ref name=\"pilcom\">{{cite video|title=\"Pilot\" commentary by Al Gough, Miles Millar and David Nutter|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

While waiting for his turn, he realized that the character is one thing above all else: \"... a high school kid ....\" To Welling, simply acting like he was a normal teenager, instead of like a super hero, was the perfect way to embody the character. Welling realized that by doing that, the special effects and other production elements would fill in the holes and perfect the character on screen.<ref name=\"TW1\"/> For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene with Kristin Kreuk (the first actor to be cast for the show), and the network thought they had \"... great chemistry\".<ref name=\"genesis\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion) pp.8\u201317</ref>\n{{Quote box\n|style=background:#c6dbf7;width:25em;max-width:40%;\n|quote= \"Honestly, I don't really have too much time to worry about the future.

According to Welling, he wanted to learn about Clark's heritage simultaneously to Clark learning about it on ''Smallville''. Welling believed that it was important for him to learn with the character, to help him be the Clark Kent envisioned by Al Gough and Miles Millar.<ref name=\"TW1\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.112-115</ref> The actor believed his lack of knowledge of the Superman mythology helped his performance, because Gough and Millar set up the series so that the previous mythology was not as important.<ref name=\"Tom\"/> Welling also enjoyed that he was in the same predicament as Clark with neither knowing the future of the character, beyond the fact that he will be Superman. When Welling landed the role of Clark Kent he was sent various Superman-related gifts, including books and toys, which Welling planned to leave unopened until the show was over.<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Welling was adamant from the beginning that he had not signed on to play Superman, but rather Clark Kent on his journey to becoming Superman, and as such had no intention of wearing the costume.<ref name=\"TW4\"/> When asked about the decision to not wear the suit in the series finale, Welling started \u201cWe jumped onto this idea that at the end of the show, the idea is that Clark becomes Superman and he\u2019s out there, and we know he\u2019s out there, but we can\u2019t go with him, but that we know and we feel good that he\u2019s out there doing good. That was what we strove for, and I think we hit it. I liked the ending of the series, because it\u2019s like, \u2018Yes, he did it!\u2019 I hope the audience didn't feel like we didn't show them something that they needed to see.

This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nEarly in the series, Clark was still learning how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was to fit in with his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, \"He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, \u2018Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play.\" Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers \"... alienate[s] him from others\".<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Welling reasoned that by the end of season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run.<ref name=\"TW2\"/> Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:<blockquote>\"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain\u2014and everyone else so much pain\u2014and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run.\"<ref name=\"TW3\">{{cite book|author=Simpson, Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 3|publisher=Titan Books|date=September 1, 2005|pages=116\u2013119|isbn=1-84023-952-2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA significant moment in the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict between him and his father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a \"... callback to [Hothead] ...\" in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow.<ref name=\"TW4\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 4 Companion) pp.&nbsp; 112\u2013115</ref> Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, \"... [Clark] learned a little bit more about what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has.\"<ref name=\"TW5\"/> The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 66</ref> Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 132</ref>\n\nWriter Holly Harold noted that the introduction of [[Green Arrow]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark was able to see how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark to start thinking about things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as \"... soon-to-be Man of Steel\".<ref name=\"TW6\">{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 6|publisher=Titan Books|date=March 2008|pages=112\u2013115|location=London|isbn=1-84576-656-3}}</ref> Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] ([[Alan Ritchson]]) and [[Acrata|Andrea Rojas]] ([[Denise Qui\u00f1ones]]), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes at the end of the episode \"Justice\". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward the day that he would put on the cape and become Superman.<ref name=\"TW6\"/>\n\n===Characterization===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nThe idea Gough and Millar came up with for their show's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his \"... bare essence ...\", discovering the reasons why Clark became Superman.<ref name=\"genesis\"/> In ''Smallville'', Clark is fallible, as Gough explains: <blockquote>The thing that we've tried to portray...is that Clark doesn't always make the right decisions, and by not making the right decisions, he brings further consequences on himself. Whether it's running away from Jor-El at the end of season two, or choosing humanity over some sort of Kryptonian mission, those decisions get him in more trouble, and cause more people to suffer, or in Jonathan Kent's case, to die.</blockquote> Welling agreed with Gough's opinion of Clark's fallibility, stating that the mistakes Clark made showed his humanity.<ref name=\"TW5\"/>\n[[File:clarkjesus.jpg|thumb|left|'''Above:''' The imagery used in the pilot episode, where Clark is strung to a scarecrow pole, drew early comparisons to Jesus Christ and his crucifixion.<br>]]\nEven though Clark could make the wrong choices, season five's \"Aqua\" helped illustrate the concept that Clark was \"... good to the core\". The episode showed how protective he could be over someone, even when that person annoyed him. In this case, he was trying to warn Lois that Arthur Curry may not have been the man she believed him to be.<ref name=\"Core\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg.124</ref> This concept was echoed by the ''[[Seattle Times]]''' Julia Waterhous, who noted that Clark, despite all his flaws, always put others before himself.<ref name=\"Waterhouse\"/> Welling's fellow actors also had their own insights into the character. Kristin Kreuk saw Clark as a kindred spirit who was sad, lonely, but also endearing;<ref>Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.116</ref> whereas John Schneider classified Clark as a [[special needs]] child.<ref>Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.140</ref>\n\nJust like his comic book counterpart, ''Smallville'''s Clark Kent was a symbolic representation of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Established early on, the pilot episode contained a moment when Clark was crucified on a scarecrow post during a high school hazing.<ref name=\"Byun\">{{cite news|author=Judge Bryan Byun |url=https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |title=Season 1 DVD review |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=November 24, 2003 |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704144317/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}</ref> The [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'s [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, \"Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?\"<ref name=\"Owen 3\">{{cite news|author=Rob Owen|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011014smallvilletv2.asp|title=Superman revisited in \"Smallville\"|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=October 14, 2001|accessdate=July 8, 2007|authorlink=Rob Owen (journalist)}}</ref> Echoing Owen, Judge Byun identified the same symbolism: \"Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good of humanity, and ''Smallville'' shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role.\"<ref name=\"Byun\"/>\n\nThis was extended to the end of season nine, where Clark sacrificed his own life in the finale, in order to send General Zod and the rest of the Kandorians to their own world. In doing so, Clark fell off a building \"... in full crucifixion pose, driving home the point that he is sacrificing himself for the good of the planet\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Carlos Delgado |url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=4071 |title=TV Review: Smallville&nbsp;\u2014 Season Nine Finale - 'Salvation' |publisher=ifMagazine |date=May 15, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519115041/http://www.ifmagazine.com/Review.asp?article=4071 |archivedate=May 19, 2010 }}</ref> To this point, [[Cinefantastique]]'s Tom Powers suggested that these images and metaphorical emphasis through dialogue exchanges came across so heavy-handed that a very devout individual might have found them offensive.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Powers|url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/05/smallvillesalvation-%e2%80%94-review/|title=Smallville:Salvation&nbsp;\u2014 Review|publisher=[[Cinefantastique|CinefantastiqueOnline]]|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and camera movements to create their own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.<ref name=\"MemCom\"/>\n\n===Relationships===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nClark's relationships with the other characters evolved over the course of the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a [[yin and yang]] type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite.<ref name=\"metcom\">{{cite video|title=\"Metamorphosis\" commentary by Al Gough and Miles Millar|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|year=2002}}</ref> His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.<ref name=\"TW1\"/>\n\nHis relationship with Lana Lang was one of ''Smallville'''s central relationships. When Clark and Lana met in the cemetery, Clark realized that he had found someone who understood him, who he could talk to, even though it was not in as strong a way as he would have liked. Although Clark felt close to Lana, his fear that she would \"... kick him out of her life ...\" if she learned his secret&nbsp;\u2014 that he came in the meteor shower that killed her parents&nbsp;\u2014 was strong enough to keep him from becoming as close to her as he wished. The lack of honesty caused issues between them.<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Judge Byun wondered how this Clark Kent would have room in his heart for Lois Lane later in life, as he had bounced back and forth between Lana and Chloe in the first season.<ref name=\"Byun\"/>\n\nWith Lana's boyfriend gone by season two, the door opened for Clark, but Welling stated he understood why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart, even after Whitney's departure: \"There's the clich\u00e9 that television shows with a main love interest fail once they get it together.\"<ref name=\"TW2\"/> After briefly being together at the beginning of the fifth season, Clark's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five. Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand in her way, but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana's safety in jeopardy. Apart from that, Clark had learned to walk the lonely road of a hero.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> His inability to cope with Lana moving on with Lex was carried over to season six. This season was the time the writers put Clark through an emotional wringer when they had Lana accept Lex's marriage proposal. For writer Kelly Souders, this presented Clark's worst fear: the woman he loved was marrying his worst enemy.<ref name=\"TW6\"/>\n\nApart from Lana, Clark had a growing [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|relationship with Lois]]. Season five saw the melting of the ice between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, and the fact that both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp.124-127</ref> In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a \"brother and sister friendship\" label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 6 Companion) pp. 124-127</ref> By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rachel Thomas|url=http://tvdramas.about.com/od/smallville/a/ericaduranceint.htm|title=Interview with Erica Durance (Lois, 'Smallville')|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=September 2008|accessdate=October 18, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922134458/http://tvdramas.about.com/od/smallville/a/ericaduranceint.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2015}}</ref> His relationship with Lois was included in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of the best TV couples of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Couples Pictures, Smallville Photos&nbsp;\u2014 Photo Gallery: The Best TV Couples of All Time|url=https://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/Best-TV-Couples-1026715/1026726|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Costume===\n[[File:Tomwelling smallville 500.jpg|thumb|upright|In season nine, Clark began wearing a black costume while fighting crime in Metropolis.]]\n\nFor most of the series, Clark did not wear any sort of costume when in his superhero persona.

The character of Clark Kent, first created for [[comic book]]s by [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] in 1938 as the alternate identity of [[Superman]], was adapted to television in 2001 by [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]]. This is the fourth time the character has been adapted to a [[live-action]] television series. Clark Kent has been played continually by [[Tom Welling]], with various other actors portraying Clark as a child. The character has also appeared in various literature based on the ''Smallville'' series, all of which are completely independent of the television episodes. As of 2011, ''Smallville''{{'}}s Clark Kent has appeared in eighteen [[young adult novels]].\n\nIn the series, Clark Kent attempts to live the life of a normal human being, and struggles with keeping the secret of his alien heritage from his friends. He has an [[on-again, off-again relationship]] with Lana Lang through the first seven seasons, the trials of which are based on his lack of honesty about his secret. In contrast to previous incarnations of the character, this Clark Kent starts out best friends with Lex Luthor, whom he meets after saving the latter's life. The pair's friendship eventually deteriorates into hatred for one another. In ''Smallville'', Clark's powers appear over time, as he is not aware of all of them at the start of the show; for instance, his heat vision and super breath do not develop until [[Smallville (season 2)|season two]] and [[Smallville (season 6)|six]], respectively.\n\nWhen developing ''Smallville''{{'s}} version of Clark Kent, the producers decided to strip him down to the \"bare essence\" of Superman;<ref name=\"genesis\"/> he is also fallible, which allows the audience to see his humanity, but that he is also \"... good to the core\".<ref name=\"Core\"/> In the series, he has been seen by critics, and intentionally portrayed by the filmmakers, as a symbolic representation of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Tom Welling has been nominated for multiple [[Teen Choice Awards|Teen Choice]] and [[Saturn Award]]s for his portrayal of Clark Kent since the show's [[Smallville (season 1)|first season]].\n\n==Role in ''Smallville''==\n[[Clark Kent]] first appears in the pilot episode of ''Smallville'' as a teen with superhuman abilities that he uses to help others. Clark is adopted by Jonathan and Martha Kent ([[John Schneider (screen actor)|John Schneider]] and [[Annette O'Toole]]) as an infant, when he crash lands on Earth on the day of the Smallville meteor shower in 1989. Twelve years later, trying to find his place in life after being told he is an alien by his adoptive father, Clark saves the life of [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] ([[Michael Rosenbaum]]), the son of billionaire [[Lionel Luthor]] ([[John Glover (actor)|John Glover]]), and the pair become quick friends.<ref name=\"Pilot ep\">{{cite episode|title=Pilot|series=Smallville|credits=[[Alfred Gough]], [[Miles Millar]] (writers) & [[David Nutter]] (director)|network=The WB|airdate=October 16, 2001|season=1|number=1|minutes=42}}</ref> During season one, Clark struggles with the burden of keeping his powers a secret from those close to him. In particular, he is afraid to open up to [[Lana Lang (Smallville)|Lana Lang]] ([[Kristin Kreuk]]) for fear that she would not accept him if she learned of his extraterrestrial origins.<ref name=\"Tom\">{{cite book|last=Simpson|first=Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 1|year=2004|publisher=[[Titan Books]]|location=London|pages=8\u201317|isbn=1-84023-795-3}}</ref>\n\nIn the season two episode \"Rosetta\", Clark learns of his [[Kryptonian]] heritage, including his native language, his birth name (Kal-El), and his birth father's [[Jor-El]] ([[Terence Stamp]]) plan for him to rule the world.<ref name=\"Rosetta ep\">{{cite episode|title=Rosetta|series=Smallville|credits=Alfred Gough, Miles Millar (writers) & [[James Marshall (director)|James Marshall]] (director)|network=The WB|airdate=February 25, 2003|season=2|number=17|minutes=42}}</ref> Fearful that he will not be able to control his own destiny, Clark runs away to Metropolis in the season two finale, leaving behind Lana, with whom he had started to develop a romantic relationship.<ref name=\"Exodus ep\">{{cite episode|title=Exodus|series=Smallville|credits=Alfred Gough, Miles Millar (writers) & Greg Beeman (director)|network=The WB|airdate=May 20, 2003|season=2|number=23|minutes=42}}</ref> In the season three premiere, three months later, Clark is brought home by Jonathan,<ref name=\"Phoenix ep\">{{cite episode|title=Phoenix|series=Smallville|credits=Kelly Souders, Brian Peterson (writers) & James Marshall (director)|network=The WB|airdate=October 3, 2003|season=3|number=2|minutes=42}}</ref> who has agreed to allow Jor-El to take Clark at an undetermined time in the future. In the season three finale, a girl calling herself Kara arrives at the Kent farm and claims to be from Krypton.

When he asked about Welling, the casting director said Welling's manager did not want him to do the role because it could hurt his feature film career. After a conversation with Welling's manager, Nutter got Welling to read the script for the pilot, which convinced him to do the part.<ref name=\"pilcom\">{{cite video|title=\"Pilot\" commentary by Al Gough, Miles Millar and David Nutter|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros.

While waiting for his turn, he realized that the character is one thing above all else: \"... a high school kid ....\" To Welling, simply acting like he was a normal teenager, instead of like a super hero, was the perfect way to embody the character. Welling realized that by doing that, the special effects and other production elements would fill in the holes and perfect the character on screen.<ref name=\"TW1\"/> For one of his auditions, he read the graveyard scene with Kristin Kreuk (the first actor to be cast for the show), and the network thought they had \"... great chemistry\".<ref name=\"genesis\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion) pp.8\u201317</ref>\n{{Quote box\n|style=background:#c6dbf7;width:25em;max-width:40%;\n|quote= \"Honestly, I don't really have too much time to worry about the future.

According to Welling, he wanted to learn about Clark's heritage simultaneously to Clark learning about it on ''Smallville''. Welling believed that it was important for him to learn with the character, to help him be the Clark Kent envisioned by Al Gough and Miles Millar.<ref name=\"TW1\">Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pp.112-115</ref> The actor believed his lack of knowledge of the Superman mythology helped his performance, because Gough and Millar set up the series so that the previous mythology was not as important.<ref name=\"Tom\"/> Welling also enjoyed that he was in the same predicament as Clark with neither knowing the future of the character, beyond the fact that he will be Superman. When Welling landed the role of Clark Kent he was sent various Superman-related gifts, including books and toys, which Welling planned to leave unopened until the show was over.<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Welling was adamant from the beginning that he had not signed on to play Superman, but rather Clark Kent on his journey to becoming Superman, and as such had no intention of wearing the costume.<ref name=\"TW4\"/> When asked about the decision to not wear the suit in the series finale, Welling started \u201cWe jumped onto this idea that at the end of the show, the idea is that Clark becomes Superman and he\u2019s out there, and we know he\u2019s out there, but we can\u2019t go with him, but that we know and we feel good that he\u2019s out there doing good. That was what we strove for, and I think we hit it. I liked the ending of the series, because it\u2019s like, \u2018Yes, he did it!\u2019 I hope the audience didn't feel like we didn't show them something that they needed to see.

These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nEarly in the series, Clark was still learning how to handle his life, by learning to control his powers and find the best solution for everyone. His main priority was to fit in with his friends at school and be an average guy. Initially, Clark's biggest problem was the fact that he could not share his secret with anyone he cared about. According to Welling, \"He is burdened with a lot of responsibility. He hasn't been able to choose whether or not he has these abilities. All this responsibility has just been thrust on him, and he has to deal with it. There have got to be times when he goes home and thinks to himself, \u2018Why me?' He wishes it could all go away and he could just be normal. That's part of the character dilemma which makes him interesting to play.\" Welling noted that the show was not about Clark always saving the day, but more about how using his powers \"... alienate[s] him from others\".<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Welling reasoned that by the end of season three, Clark had decided that leaving Smallville and going with Jor-El was something that would save everyone a lot of pain in the long run.<ref name=\"TW2\"/> Welling described why Clark finally gave in to Jor-El at the end of season three:<blockquote>\"If you can't fight them, you might as well join them [...] he was choosing the lesser of two evils to go with Jor-El. I think a combination of those two things would probably sum it up. A lot of times in your life, you get to a point where you go, 'I just can't fight this anymore. There's nothing I can do about it, so I better get up out of bed and go to work!' And in a sense, that's what Clark had to do. Somehow he had to try to face what it was that was causing him so much pain\u2014and everyone else so much pain\u2014and maybe he reasoned that by causing everyone else a little bit of pain, he could save them a lot of pain in the long run.\"<ref name=\"TW3\">{{cite book|author=Simpson, Paul|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 3|publisher=Titan Books|date=September 1, 2005|pages=116\u2013119|isbn=1-84023-952-2}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nA significant moment in the character's story came when Clark decided to play football in season four, providing conflict between him and his father. Writer Darren Swimmer refers to this moment as a \"... callback to [Hothead] ...\" in season one. To him, when Clark defies Jonathan and joins the team anyway, it signified the moment where Jonathan finally decided that he can trust Clark to not hurt anyone. Writer Todd Slavkin viewed it as Clark finally emerging from his father's shadow.<ref name=\"TW4\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 4 Companion) pp.&nbsp; 112\u2013115</ref> Two more significant moments came during the following season. First, Clark lost his powers when he failed to return to Jor-El to finish his training; leaving him human and vulnerable. According to Welling, \"... [Clark] learned a little bit more about what it's like to be human, physically. Emotionally, he's pretty close to trying to understand that. It added more weight to his abilities once he got them back, and it made him realize his responsibilities for what he has.\"<ref name=\"TW5\"/> The second moment came in the show's 100th episode, with the death of Clark's adoptive father. The decision to kill Jonathan was made so that Clark could finally step into his destiny, allowing Clark the boy to become Clark the man, as explained by Gough. In order to do that he needed his mentor to die, so that no one would buffer him from the world any longer.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 66</ref> Welling saw the series' 100th episode as the chance for his character to evolve and grow.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> John Schneider saw the same catalyst for Clark's evolution. According to Schneider, Jonathan's death inspired Clark to make the move toward his eventual destiny. Jonathan provided such an example of sacrifice that it leaves a void in Clark. To fill that void Clark would have to become Superman. It was Schneider's contention that had Jonathan not been the man he was, when the time came that the world needed Superman, Clark would have been unable to take on that persona, because he would not realize that the world needed him.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg. 132</ref>\n\nWriter Holly Harold noted that the introduction of [[Green Arrow]] ([[Justin Hartley]]) allowed Clark to mature more in the sixth season. Clark was able to see how others achieved the same goals, but used alternative routes that perhaps crossed moral lines. This taught Clark to start thinking about things from his opponents' perspectives. Ultimately, in season six Clark learned it would be his human side that allowed him to become the hero he needed to be, summed up by writer Turi Meyer as \"... soon-to-be Man of Steel\".<ref name=\"TW6\">{{cite book|author=Byrne, Craig|title=Smallville: The Official Companion Season 6|publisher=Titan Books|date=March 2008|pages=112\u2013115|location=London|isbn=1-84576-656-3}}</ref> Each season, Clark gained insight into how not to misuse his abilities from the kryptonite-mutated villains that used them for crime. In later seasons, Clark saw how even those that used their abilities for good might still have questionable actions, specifically [[Aquaman|Arthur Curry]] ([[Alan Ritchson]]) and [[Acrata|Andrea Rojas]] ([[Denise Qui\u00f1ones]]), though Clark did help them take the high road. Those episodes reiterated the effect Clark's parents had on how he used his abilities.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> Clark also learned that he cannot do everything alone, even though he chose not to join Oliver's team of superheroes at the end of the episode \"Justice\". For Meyer, season six showed that Clark was still struggling to accept his destiny, but did take steps toward the day that he would put on the cape and become Superman.<ref name=\"TW6\"/>\n\n===Characterization===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nThe idea Gough and Millar came up with for their show's version of Clark Kent was to strip him down to his \"... bare essence ...\", discovering the reasons why Clark became Superman.<ref name=\"genesis\"/> In ''Smallville'', Clark is fallible, as Gough explains: <blockquote>The thing that we've tried to portray...is that Clark doesn't always make the right decisions, and by not making the right decisions, he brings further consequences on himself. Whether it's running away from Jor-El at the end of season two, or choosing humanity over some sort of Kryptonian mission, those decisions get him in more trouble, and cause more people to suffer, or in Jonathan Kent's case, to die.</blockquote> Welling agreed with Gough's opinion of Clark's fallibility, stating that the mistakes Clark made showed his humanity.<ref name=\"TW5\"/>\n[[File:clarkjesus.jpg|thumb|left|'''Above:''' The imagery used in the pilot episode, where Clark is strung to a scarecrow pole, drew early comparisons to Jesus Christ and his crucifixion.<br>]]\nEven though Clark could make the wrong choices, season five's \"Aqua\" helped illustrate the concept that Clark was \"... good to the core\". The episode showed how protective he could be over someone, even when that person annoyed him. In this case, he was trying to warn Lois that Arthur Curry may not have been the man she believed him to be.<ref name=\"Core\">Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pg.124</ref> This concept was echoed by the ''[[Seattle Times]]''' Julia Waterhous, who noted that Clark, despite all his flaws, always put others before himself.<ref name=\"Waterhouse\"/> Welling's fellow actors also had their own insights into the character. Kristin Kreuk saw Clark as a kindred spirit who was sad, lonely, but also endearing;<ref>Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.116</ref> whereas John Schneider classified Clark as a [[special needs]] child.<ref>Simpson, Paul, (Season 1 Companion), pg.140</ref>\n\nJust like his comic book counterpart, ''Smallville'''s Clark Kent was a symbolic representation of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]. Established early on, the pilot episode contained a moment when Clark was crucified on a scarecrow post during a high school hazing.<ref name=\"Byun\">{{cite news|author=Judge Bryan Byun |url=https://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |title=Season 1 DVD review |publisher=DVD Verdict |date=November 24, 2003 |accessdate=August 20, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704144317/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/smallvilleseason1.php |archivedate=July 4, 2008 }}</ref> The [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'s [[Rob Owen (journalist)|Rob Owen]] noted the Christ-like imagery of the scene, stating, \"Is it any wonder Clark gets tied up there since Superman, too, was 'sent to save us'?\"<ref name=\"Owen 3\">{{cite news|author=Rob Owen|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/tv/20011014smallvilletv2.asp|title=Superman revisited in \"Smallville\"|publisher=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=October 14, 2001|accessdate=July 8, 2007|authorlink=Rob Owen (journalist)}}</ref> Echoing Owen, Judge Byun identified the same symbolism: \"Superman is, in a way, the secular pop culture stand-in for Jesus Christ, a messiah figure for our generation. The series makes this theme explicit in its pilot episode, in which Clark is symbolically 'crucified' in a cornfield. That striking bit of symbolism becomes the central preoccupation of the series; Clark is the savior who sacrifices all for the greater good of humanity, and ''Smallville'' shows us how he comes to accept and embrace that role.\"<ref name=\"Byun\"/>\n\nThis was extended to the end of season nine, where Clark sacrificed his own life in the finale, in order to send General Zod and the rest of the Kandorians to their own world. In doing so, Clark fell off a building \"... in full crucifixion pose, driving home the point that he is sacrificing himself for the good of the planet\".<ref>{{cite web|author=Carlos Delgado |url=http://www.ifmagazine.com/review.asp?article=4071 |title=TV Review: Smallville&nbsp;\u2014 Season Nine Finale - 'Salvation' |publisher=ifMagazine |date=May 15, 2010 |accessdate=September 26, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100519115041/http://www.ifmagazine.com/Review.asp?article=4071 |archivedate=May 19, 2010 }}</ref> To this point, [[Cinefantastique]]'s Tom Powers suggested that these images and metaphorical emphasis through dialogue exchanges came across so heavy-handed that a very devout individual might have found them offensive.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tom Powers|url=http://cinefantastiqueonline.com/2010/05/smallvillesalvation-%e2%80%94-review/|title=Smallville:Salvation&nbsp;\u2014 Review|publisher=[[Cinefantastique|CinefantastiqueOnline]]|date=May 14, 2010|accessdate=September 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to religious allusions, the crew used color schemes and camera movements to create their own themes for the characters. Since the show was told from Clark's point of view, particular visual elements were utilized to illustrate a particular characteristic. When he was safe at home the colors used to illustrate the environment were warm and gentle, with an earth tone, while the camera movement was gentle as well. When Clark was keeping his secret, but there was no danger around, the lighting was more neutral, with greater camera movement. When there was danger, the lighting became colder with more grays and blues, and the camera shifted to a handheld, allowing more extreme angles.<ref name=\"MemCom\"/>\n\n===Relationships===\n<!--STOP! These sections are for real world content ONLY. This is not the place to discuss general plot info, but where analysis of plot, relationships, and characterization is given by REAL PEOPLE.!-->\n\nClark's relationships with the other characters evolved over the course of the show. Clark's relationship with Lex Luthor was symbolic, as the two shared a [[yin and yang]] type of relationship. In the pilot, Clark first saved Lex from drowning after a car accident; at the end of the episode, Lex saved Clark when he was strung up in the cornfield and immobilized by kryptonite.<ref name=\"metcom\">{{cite video|title=\"Metamorphosis\" commentary by Al Gough and Miles Millar|medium=DVD|publisher=[[Warner Bros. Television]]|year=2002}}</ref> His relationship with Lex was tested by his lack of honesty, just like it was with Lana for the first six seasons; the same could be said for Lex's dishonesty with Clark. Both characters wanted to be completely honest with each other, but knew they could not, which inhibited their friendship.<ref name=\"TW1\"/>\n\nHis relationship with Lana Lang was one of ''Smallville'''s central relationships. When Clark and Lana met in the cemetery, Clark realized that he had found someone who understood him, who he could talk to, even though it was not in as strong a way as he would have liked. Although Clark felt close to Lana, his fear that she would \"... kick him out of her life ...\" if she learned his secret&nbsp;\u2014 that he came in the meteor shower that killed her parents&nbsp;\u2014 was strong enough to keep him from becoming as close to her as he wished. The lack of honesty caused issues between them.<ref name=\"TW1\"/> Judge Byun wondered how this Clark Kent would have room in his heart for Lois Lane later in life, as he had bounced back and forth between Lana and Chloe in the first season.<ref name=\"Byun\"/>\n\nWith Lana's boyfriend gone by season two, the door opened for Clark, but Welling stated he understood why the producers continued to keep Clark and Lana apart, even after Whitney's departure: \"There's the clich\u00e9 that television shows with a main love interest fail once they get it together.\"<ref name=\"TW2\"/> After briefly being together at the beginning of the fifth season, Clark's upbringing was not enough to help him cope with the loss of Lana to Lex toward the end of season five. Welling admits that Clark had learned to let Lana make her own choices and not stand in her way, but his problem with her relationship with Lex was that Lex is a dangerous individual and it put Lana's safety in jeopardy. Apart from that, Clark had learned to walk the lonely road of a hero.<ref name=\"TW5\"/> His inability to cope with Lana moving on with Lex was carried over to season six. This season was the time the writers put Clark through an emotional wringer when they had Lana accept Lex's marriage proposal. For writer Kelly Souders, this presented Clark's worst fear: the woman he loved was marrying his worst enemy.<ref name=\"TW6\"/>\n\nApart from Lana, Clark had a growing [[Relationship of Clark Kent and Lois Lane|relationship with Lois]]. Season five saw the melting of the ice between the two characters, who continued to butt heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, and the fact that both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 5 Companion) pp.124-127</ref> In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a \"brother and sister friendship\" label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels.<ref>Byrne, Craig, (Season 6 Companion) pp. 124-127</ref> By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rachel Thomas|url=http://tvdramas.about.com/od/smallville/a/ericaduranceint.htm|title=Interview with Erica Durance (Lois, 'Smallville')|publisher=[[About.com]]|date=September 2008|accessdate=October 18, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922134458/http://tvdramas.about.com/od/smallville/a/ericaduranceint.htm|archivedate=September 22, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> His relationship with Lois was included in ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s list of the best TV couples of all time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Couples Pictures, Smallville Photos&nbsp;\u2014 Photo Gallery: The Best TV Couples of All Time|url=https://www.tvguide.com/PhotoGallery/Best-TV-Couples-1026715/1026726|work=[[TV Guide]]|accessdate=June 25, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Costume===\n[[File:Tomwelling smallville 500.jpg|thumb|upright|In season nine, Clark began wearing a black costume while fighting crime in Metropolis.]]\n\nFor most of the series, Clark did not wear any sort of costume when in his superhero persona.

They split from the [[Soviet Union national football team]] after independence in 1991 and joined the [[Asian Football Confederation]]'s [[Central Asian Football Federation]]. After failing to qualify for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]s, they joined [[UEFA]], but are yet to qualify for a [[FIFA World Cup]] or a [[UEFA European Championship]].\n\n==History==\n===AFC Member (1992\u20132002)===\nThe country of Kazakhstan declared independence from the [[Soviet Union]] on December 16, 1991. Its national team then split from the [[Soviet Union national football team]] (a [[UEFA]] member) and joined the [[Asian Football Confederation]]. At the time, they were one of strongest teams in Central Asia, and one of the most improving teams in Asia.\n\nThe team played their first match against another former-Soviet debutant, [[Turkmenistan national football team|Turkmenistan]], on June 1, 1992, as part of a Central Asian tournament. Kazakhstan won 1\u20130. The tournament also saw the footballing debuts of [[Uzbekistan national football team|Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan national football team|Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan national football team|Tajikistan]]. After beating [[Libya national football team|Libya]] in a friendly in [[North Korea]] on July 3, Kazakhstan played the remainder of its Central Asian fixtures and avoided defeat in all of them. They beat Uzbekistan 1\u20130 at home on July 16, then drew 1\u20131 away in Turkmenistan on September 14, in Kyrgyzstan on September 26 and Uzbekistan on October 14. The final match was a 2\u20130 home victory over Kyrgyzstan on October 25.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher= The Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|title=Kazakhstan \u2013 List of International Matches|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kaz-intres.html|accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nKazakhstan entered qualification for the first time in the attempt to reach the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. In the first round they were placed in Group 9 alongside [[Pakistan national football team|Pakistan]] and [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]]. Kazakhstan's first qualifying match was won 3\u20130 at home in [[Almaty]] on May 11, 1997, against Pakistan. On June 6 they travelled to [[Baghdad]] to face Iraq and won 2\u20131, then five days later won an away match against Pakistan, 7\u20130 in [[Lahore]]. The result remains Kazakhstan's biggest-ever international win. They retained their 100% start to World Cup football by beating Iraq at home 3\u20131 on June 29.\n\nIn the second and final round of qualification, Kazakhstan came last in the group. Their only victory was on October 18, 1997, when they beat the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] 3\u20130 at home. Kazakhstan drew three other games&nbsp;\u2013 all at home (versus Uzbekistan, [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]).\n\nIn the first round of Asian qualifying, Kazakhstan were placed in Group 6 alongside [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]], [[Nepal national football team|Nepal]] and [[Macau national football team|Macau]]. All games in the group were to be held in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan, after Nepal failed to organise matches in [[Kathmandu]] in March 2001. After an Iraqi protest, the first three games for each team were moved to [[Baghdad]], Iraq.\n\nKazakhstan started off well in Baghdad by beating Nepal 6\u20130 with two goals by [[Oleg Litvinenko]] on April 12, and Macau 3\u20130 two days later. On April 16 they held Iraq to a 1\u20131 draw in front of 50,000. [[Ruslan Baltiev]] put the Kazakhs in front in the 6th minute and [[Abdul-Wahab Abu Al-Hail]] equalised with a penalty in the 31st.\n\nIn [[Almaty Central Stadium]], Kazakhstan beat Nepal 3\u20130 with two goals by [[Maksim Igorevich Shevchenko]] on April 21. Two days later they beat Macau 5\u20130, [[Dmitriy Byakov]] and [[Igor Avdeyev]] scored two each after a goalless first half. The final game on April 25 saw a 1\u20131 draw against Iraq in front of 25,000. Litvinenko put Kazakhstan ahead in the 32nd but Iraq equalised ten minutes later. Despite being level on points, Iraq advanced on goal difference mainly due to a 9\u20131 victory over Nepal.\n\n===UEFA Member (2002\u2013present)===\nBeing a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental country]], Kazakhstan joined [[UEFA]] in 2002. They had to wait until the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] finished on June 30 before making the switch, as they had entered the tournament as an AFC member. Kazakhstan therefore could not enter qualification for [[UEFA Euro 2004]], as the draw had been made on 25 January 2002. Since joining UEFA, Kazakhstan has been a relatively minnow force in the continent, with most of their qualifications being unsuccessful and often finish near dead last or bottom.\n\nIn the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2006 FIFA World Cup qualification]], now as members of UEFA, Kazakhstan was placed in the last drawing pot with [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407120638/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com:80/releases/uefa_draw_procedure_en.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=7 April 2005|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> being placed in Group 2 alongside [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], future [[UEFA Euro 2004]] winners [[Greece national football team|Greece]], [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] and [[Albania national football team|Albania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/matches/preliminaries/europe/index.html|title=2006 FIFA World Cup Germany \u2122 \u2013 Qualifiers \u2013 Europe|first=|last=FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com}}</ref>\n\nTheir first official UEFA match was on 8 September 2004 and ended in a home defeat by 2\u20131 against Ukraine. Kazakhstan lost their next 9 matches, including a 6\u20130 home defeat against Turkey, their tied-biggest defeat up to 2018 and conceding a home defeat to Greece into four minutes of the stoppage time. Their sole point of the qualifying came in the next match, on 8 October 2005, in a 0\u20130 away draw against Georgia played behind closed doors, before losing the last match at home against Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/2006q.html|title=World Cup 2006 Qualifying|website=www.rsssf.com}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying]], Kazakhstan was once again placed in the last drawing pot. Their campaign started with two away draws against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] (0\u20130) and [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] (1\u20131). They lost the next three matches before getting their first official win as UEFA members in a 2\u20131 home triumph against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] with goals from [[Kairat Ashirbekov]] and [[Nurbol Zhumaskaliyev]]. After a home loss against [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]], Kazakhstan got their sixth and seventh points after drawing again with Azerbaijan (1\u20131) and Belgium (2\u20132), both at home. Losses against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] were followed by their second win, this time away from home, with [[Sergei Ostapenko]] scoring the winning goal against Armenia. Their last match was a delayed game against Serbia, ending in defeat. In the end, Kazakhstan finished with 10 points and in 6th out of the 8 Group A teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2008/standings/round=2241/group=2630/index.html|title=UEFA EURO 2008 \u2013 History \u2013 Standings|first=|last=uefa.com|website=UEFA.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] had Kazakhstan in the 5th of 6 drawing pots, drawn in Group 6 with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], [[England national football team|England]], Ukraine, [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] and [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.today/7OR5l|title=TheFA.com \u2013 Qualifying fixtures agreed|date=13 May 2008|website=archive.vn}}</ref> They started the campaign with a 3\u20130 home win against Andorra on 20 August 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=250471/match=300040546/report.html|title=2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 \u2013 Matches \u2013 Kazakhstan-Andorra|first=|last=FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com}}</ref> However, that was the only opponent they managed to get points from, after they won the reverse fixture 3\u20131 on 9 September 2009 and losing all the other group matches.

They lost their next three games before ending the qualifying with a goalless home draw against [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. They ended in the last place with 4 points, three behind Azerbaijan.<ref>[[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group A]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n\nFollowing recent unimpressive qualifying campaigns, Kazakhstan was once again in the last drawing pot for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]]. Their campaign in Group C started with two defeats before getting their first point in a goalless home draw against Austria on 12 October 2012. Losses to Austria and twice to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] were followed by their first and only win of the qualification by 2\u20131 against [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]] on 6 September 2013. They still got a fifth point in a 1\u20131 away drawn against the same opponents. Kazakhstan finished in 5th place, ahead only of the Faroese.\n\nThe [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] had Kazakhstan once more in the last drawing pot. Their first match was a home 0\u20130 draw against [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] on 9 September 2014, followed by six consecutive losses before another goalless draw, away from home, against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]. After their seventh defeat of the qualifying, Kazakhstan ended the campaign with a 1\u20130 away win against Latvia on 13 October 2015. The goal scored by [[Islambek Kuat]] got the Kazakhs the 5th place, tied in points with the Latvians, but with a better head-to-head record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/standings/round=2000446/group=2002428/index.html|title=UEFA EURO 2016 \u2013 History \u2013 Standings|first=|last=uefa.com|website=UEFA.com}}</ref>\n\nOnce again in the last drawing pot, Kazakhstan had an unimpressive [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign, failing to win a single match. After two home draws against Poland and [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in their first three matches, Kazakhstan lost their following six matches, ending the qualifying with a 1\u20131 home draw against Armenia and finishing last in Group E.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/index.html|title=2018 FIFA World Cup Russia\u2122 \u2013 Qualifiers \u2013 Europe|first=|last=FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League]], Kazakhstan was in Pot 3 of [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League D|League D]], the fourth and lowest division of the [[UEFA Nations League]]. Drawn in Group 1 with Georgia, Latvia and Andorra, their campaign started with a 2\u20130 home loss against group winners Georgia. Away draws against Andorra and Latvia had Georgia with 9 points after the three first matches, with all the other teams tied with 2 points. Kazakhstan defeated Andorra by 4\u20130 on 16 October, but the Georgia win against Latvia got the Georgians promoted to League C with two matches still to be played.

This has remained in interests for many Kazakhs, due to its inferiority in the UEFA qualification stages contrast to their previous strong image in the AFC competitions.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Association football}}\n* [[Football in Kazakhstan]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n\n{{Commons category|Kazakhstan national football team}}\n* [http://www.kff.kz/ Official website]\n\n{{Kazakhstan NFT results}}\n{{Football in Kazakhstan}}\n{{UEFA teams}}\n{{AFC teams}}\n{{National sports teams of Kazakhstan}}\n\n[[Category:European national association football teams]]\n[[Category:Asian national association football teams]]\n[[Category:Kazakhstan national football team| ]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the men's team|the women's team|Kazakhstan women's national football team}}\n\n{{Infobox national football team\n| Name = Kazakhstan\n| Nickname = \u049a\u0430\u0440\u0448\u044b\u0493\u0430\u043b\u0430\u0440 (The Hawks)\n| Badge = Kazakhstan Football Federation logo.svg\n| Badge_size = 200px\n| Association = [[Kazakhstan Football Federation]] (KFF)\n| Confederation = [[UEFA]] (Europe)\n| Coach = [[Michal B\u00edlek]]\n| Captain = [[Bauyrzhan Islamkhan]]\n| Most caps = [[Samat Smakov]] (76)\n| Top scorer = [[Ruslan Baltiev]] (13)\n| Home Stadium = [[Astana Arena]]\n| FIFA Trigramme = KAZ\n| FIFA Rank = {{FIFA World Rankings|KAZ}}\n| FIFA max = 83\n| FIFA max date = September 2016\n| FIFA min = 166\n| FIFA min date = May 1996\n| Elo Rank = {{World Football Elo Ratings|Kazakhstan}}\n| Elo max = 70\n| Elo max date = 18 October 1997\n| Elo min = 136\n| Elo min date = September 2005\n| pattern_la1 = _kaz18h\n| pattern_b1 =_kaz18h\n| pattern_ra1 =_kaz18h\n| pattern_sh1 =_kaz18h\n| pattern_so1 =_kaz18h\n| leftarm1 = ffff00\n| body1 = ffff00\n| rightarm1 = ffff00\n| short1 = ffff00\n| socks1 = ffff00\n| pattern_la2 = _kaz18a\n| pattern_b2 = _kaz18a\n| pattern_ra2 = _kaz18a\n| pattern_sh2 = _kaz18a\n| pattern_so2 = _kaz18a\n| leftarm2 = 49c1f5\n| body2 = 49c1f5\n| rightarm2 = 49c1f5\n| shorts2 = 49c1f5\n| socks2 = 49c1f5\n| First game = {{flagicon|KAZ|1991}} '''Kazakhstan''' 1\u20130 {{fb-rt|TKM|1992}} <br> ([[Almaty]], Kazakhstan; June 1, 1992)\n| Largest win = {{fb|PAK}} 0\u20137 {{fb-rt|KAZ}} <br> ([[Lahore]], Pakistan; June 11, 1997)\n<br> {{fb|KAZ}} 7\u20131 {{fb-rt|KGZ}} <br> ([[Astana]], Kazakhstan; September 5, 2014)\n| Largest loss = {{fb|KAZ}} 0\u20136 {{fb-rt|TUR}} <br> ([[Almaty]], Kazakhstan; June 8, 2005) <br> {{Fb|RUS}} 6\u20130 {{fb-rt|KAZ}} <br> ([[Moscow]], Russia; May 23, 2008)\n| Regional name      = [[WAFF Championship]]\n| Regional cup apps  = 1\n| Regional cup first = [[2000 WAFF Championship|2000]]\n| Regional cup best  = Group stage (1 times) \n}}\nThe '''Kazakhstan national football team''' ({{lang-kk|\u049a\u0430\u0437\u0430\u049b\u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d \u04b0\u043b\u0442\u0442\u044b\u049b \u0444\u0443\u0442\u0431\u043e\u043b \u049b\u04b1\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0441\u044b}}, ''Qazaqstan Ulttyq F\u00fdtbol Kuramasy'') represents [[Kazakhstan]] in men's international [[association football|football]] and it's governed by the [[Football Federation of Kazakhstan]]. They split from the [[Soviet Union national football team]] after independence in 1991 and joined the [[Asian Football Confederation]]'s [[Central Asian Football Federation]]. After failing to qualify for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] and [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]s, they joined [[UEFA]], but are yet to qualify for a [[FIFA World Cup]] or a [[UEFA European Championship]].\n\n==History==\n===AFC Member (1992\u20132002)===\nThe country of Kazakhstan declared independence from the [[Soviet Union]] on December 16, 1991. Its national team then split from the [[Soviet Union national football team]] (a [[UEFA]] member) and joined the [[Asian Football Confederation]]. At the time, they were one of strongest teams in Central Asia, and one of the most improving teams in Asia.\n\nThe team played their first match against another former-Soviet debutant, [[Turkmenistan national football team|Turkmenistan]], on June 1, 1992, as part of a Central Asian tournament. Kazakhstan won 1\u20130. The tournament also saw the footballing debuts of [[Uzbekistan national football team|Uzbekistan]], [[Kyrgyzstan national football team|Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Tajikistan national football team|Tajikistan]]. After beating [[Libya national football team|Libya]] in a friendly in [[North Korea]] on July 3, Kazakhstan played the remainder of its Central Asian fixtures and avoided defeat in all of them. They beat Uzbekistan 1\u20130 at home on July 16, then drew 1\u20131 away in Turkmenistan on September 14, in Kyrgyzstan on September 26 and Uzbekistan on October 14. The final match was a 2\u20130 home victory over Kyrgyzstan on October 25.<ref>{{Cite web|publisher= The Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|title=Kazakhstan \u2013 List of International Matches|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesk/kaz-intres.html|accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nKazakhstan entered qualification for the first time in the attempt to reach the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]. In the first round they were placed in Group 9 alongside [[Pakistan national football team|Pakistan]] and [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]]. Kazakhstan's first qualifying match was won 3\u20130 at home in [[Almaty]] on May 11, 1997, against Pakistan. On June 6 they travelled to [[Baghdad]] to face Iraq and won 2\u20131, then five days later won an away match against Pakistan, 7\u20130 in [[Lahore]]. The result remains Kazakhstan's biggest-ever international win. They retained their 100% start to World Cup football by beating Iraq at home 3\u20131 on June 29.\n\nIn the second and final round of qualification, Kazakhstan came last in the group. Their only victory was on October 18, 1997, when they beat the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]] 3\u20130 at home. Kazakhstan drew three other games&nbsp;\u2013 all at home (versus Uzbekistan, [[Japan national football team|Japan]] and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]]).\n\nIn the first round of Asian qualifying, Kazakhstan were placed in Group 6 alongside [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]], [[Nepal national football team|Nepal]] and [[Macau national football team|Macau]]. All games in the group were to be held in [[Almaty]], Kazakhstan, after Nepal failed to organise matches in [[Kathmandu]] in March 2001. After an Iraqi protest, the first three games for each team were moved to [[Baghdad]], Iraq.\n\nKazakhstan started off well in Baghdad by beating Nepal 6\u20130 with two goals by [[Oleg Litvinenko]] on April 12, and Macau 3\u20130 two days later. On April 16 they held Iraq to a 1\u20131 draw in front of 50,000. [[Ruslan Baltiev]] put the Kazakhs in front in the 6th minute and [[Abdul-Wahab Abu Al-Hail]] equalised with a penalty in the 31st.\n\nIn [[Almaty Central Stadium]], Kazakhstan beat Nepal 3\u20130 with two goals by [[Maksim Igorevich Shevchenko]] on April 21. Two days later they beat Macau 5\u20130, [[Dmitriy Byakov]] and [[Igor Avdeyev]] scored two each after a goalless first half. The final game on April 25 saw a 1\u20131 draw against Iraq in front of 25,000. Litvinenko put Kazakhstan ahead in the 32nd but Iraq equalised ten minutes later. Despite being level on points, Iraq advanced on goal difference mainly due to a 9\u20131 victory over Nepal.\n\n===UEFA Member (2002\u2013present)===\nBeing a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental country]], Kazakhstan joined [[UEFA]] in 2002. They had to wait until the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] finished on June 30 before making the switch, as they had entered the tournament as an AFC member. Kazakhstan therefore could not enter qualification for [[UEFA Euro 2004]], as the draw had been made on January 25, 2002. Since joining the UEFA, Kazakhstan has been a relatively minnow force in the continent, with most of their qualifications being unsuccessful and often finish near dead last or bottom.\n\nIn the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2006 FIFA World Cup qualification]], now as members of UEFA, Kazakhstan was placed in the last drawing pot with [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]] and [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050407120638/http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com:80/releases/uefa_draw_procedure_en.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=7 April 2005|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> being placed in Group 2 alongside [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], future [[UEFA Euro 2004]] winners [[Greece national football team|Greece]], [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]] and [[Albania national football team|Albania]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/matches/preliminaries/europe/index.html|title=2006 FIFA World Cup Germany \u2122 \u2013 Qualifiers \u2013 Europe|first=|last=FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com}}</ref>\n\nTheir first official UEFA match was on 8 September 2004 and ended in a home defeat by 2\u20131 against Ukraine. Kazakhstan lost their next 9 matches, including a 6\u20130 home defeat against Turkey, their tied-biggest defeat up to 2018 and conceding a home defeat to Greece into four minutes of the stoppage time. Their sole point of the qualifying came in the next match, on 8 October 2005, in a 0\u20130 away draw against Georgia played behind closed doors, before losing the last match at home against Denmark.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tables/2006q.html|title=World Cup 2006 Qualifying|website=www.rsssf.com}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying]], Kazakhstan was once again placed in the last drawing pot. Their campaign started with two away draws against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] (0\u20130) and [[Azerbaijan national football team|Azerbaijan]] (1\u20131). They lost the next three matches before getting their first official win as UEFA members in a 2\u20131 home triumph against [[Serbia national football team|Serbia]] with goals from [[Kairat Ashirbekov]] and [[Nurbol Zhumaskaliyev]]. After a home loss against [[Armenia national football team|Armenia]], Kazakhstan got their sixth and seventh points after drawing again with Azerbaijan (1\u20131) and Belgium (2\u20132), both at home. Losses against [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] were followed by their second win, this time away from home, with [[Sergei Ostapenko]] scoring the winning goal against Armenia. Their last match was a delayed game against Serbia, ending in defeat. In the end, Kazakhstan finished with 10 points and in 6th out of the 8 Group A teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2008/standings/round=2241/group=2630/index.html|title=UEFA EURO 2008 \u2013 History \u2013 Standings|first=|last=uefa.com|website=UEFA.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 FIFA World Cup qualification]] had Kazakhstan in the 5th of 6 drawing pots, drawn in Group 6 with [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]], [[England national football team|England]], Ukraine, [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]] and [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.today/7OR5l|title=TheFA.com \u2013 Qualifying fixtures agreed|date=13 May 2008|website=archive.vn}}</ref> They started the campaign with a 3\u20130 home win against Andorra on 20 August 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=250471/match=300040546/report.html|title=2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa\u2122 \u2013 Matches \u2013 Kazakhstan-Andorra|first=|last=FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com}}</ref> However, that was the only opponent they managed to get points from, after they won the reverse fixture 3\u20131 on 9 September 2009 and losing all the other group matches.

They lost their next three games before ending the qualifying with a goalless home draw against [[Austria national football team|Austria]]. They ended in the last place with 4 points, three behind Azerbaijan.<ref>[[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group A]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n\nFollowing recent unimpressive qualifying campaigns, Kazakhstan was once again in the last drawing pot for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualification]]. Their campaign in Group C started with two defeats before getting their first point in a goalless home draw against Austria on 12 October 2012. Losses to Austria and twice to [[Germany national football team|Germany]] were followed by their first and only win of the qualification by 2\u20131 against [[Faroe Islands national football team|Faroe Islands]] on 6 September 2013. They still got a fifth point in a 1\u20131 away drawn against the same opponents. Kazakhstan finished in 5th place, ahead only of the Faroese.\n\nThe [[UEFA Euro 2016 qualifying]] had Kazakhstan once more in the last drawing pot. Their first match was a home 0\u20130 draw against [[Latvia national football team|Latvia]] on 9 September 2014, followed by six consecutive losses before another goalless draw, away from home, against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]]. After their seventh defeat of the qualifying, Kazakhstan ended the campaign with a 1\u20130 away win against Latvia on 13 October 2015. The goal scored by [[Islambek Kuat]] got the Kazakhs the 5th place, tied in points with the Latvians, but with a better head-to-head record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2016/standings/round=2000446/group=2002428/index.html|title=UEFA EURO 2016 \u2013 History \u2013 Standings|first=|last=uefa.com|website=UEFA.com}}</ref>\n\nOnce again in the last drawing pot, Kazakhstan had an unimpressive [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]] campaign, failing to win a single match. After two home draws against Poland and [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in their first three matches, Kazakhstan lost their following six matches, ending the qualifying with a 1\u20131 home draw against Armenia and finishing last in Group E.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/europe/index.html|title=2018 FIFA World Cup Russia\u2122 \u2013 Qualifiers \u2013 Europe|first=|last=FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com}}</ref>\n\nFor the [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League]], Kazakhstan was in Pot 3 of [[2018\u201319 UEFA Nations League D|League D]], the fourth and lowest division of the [[UEFA Nations League]]. Drawn in Group 1 with Georgia, Latvia and Andorra, their campaign started with a 2\u20130 home loss against group winners Georgia. Away draws against Andorra and Latvia had Georgia with 9 points after the three first matches, with all the other teams tied with 2 points. Kazakhstan defeated Andorra by 4\u20130 on 16 October, but the Georgia win against Latvia got the Georgians promoted to League C with two matches still to be played. Their sixth and last point came in a 1\u20131 home draw against Latvia, before being defeated by Georgia in the last group match and finishing in the second place of the group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefanationsleague/standings/|title=UEFA Nations League \u2013 Standings|first=|last=UEFA.com|website=UEFA.com}}</ref>\n\nThe [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying]] for Kazakhstan once again was unsuccessful, with the team continued to fail in the qualification due to being inferior to Russia and Belgium. However, Kazakhstan won ten points in the qualification, its best performance up to date in any Euro qualifications, including a shock 3\u20130 home win over [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47564455|title=Kazakhstan 3-0 Scotland: Alex McLeish's side humiliated in Euro 2020 opener|date=March 21,

Until the 20th century it was thought to depict [[Ludovico Sforza]], a [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]] and employer of Leonardo. During a 1904\u20131905 restoration, the removal of overpainting revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]], indicated that the sitter may be a musician.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary records of its [[commission (art)|commission]] exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars believe it was likely completed by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait contains the dark background portrait typical of Leonardo's time in Milan. ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' and ''[[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]]'' are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has been housed at the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672. Over the centuries, many Italian musicians and politicians to have been proposed as the sitter. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} It is, with the exception of the face, largely unfinished and depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position whose his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' and ''[[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]]'', from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}\n\n===The musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail of the musical score]]The man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint]]ed brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} According to Laure Fagnart, these colors are due to poor conservation and some repainting and are likely not the original colors. The doublet was probably originally dark red and the stole bright yellow.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defend Leonardo, claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=239}}\n\n===The musical score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This has not stopped some scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} The notes are also undoubtedly in [[mensural notation]] and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} Drawings from [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]] with Leonardo's own music notational style do not share a resemblance to the music in the painting.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} Suggesting that the music is not by him, which leaves the composer and the significance of the music, unknown.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and date===\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Kemp|2003}} This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].{{sfn|Wallace}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}} But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}}\n\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and ''[[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]]'' respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}} The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' and ''[[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]]''.{{sfn|Kemp|2003}} The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later ''Lady with an Ermine'' from 1489-1490, is representative of this newly gained dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}}{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to remain in Milan, and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before are unknown but it was listed with a description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]], but at the time was thought to be a Leonardo portrait of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\nThese assumptions were taken without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding a [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}} Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Possible subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano]]'s drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|National Gallery|2011|p=5}} However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], a priest, music theorist and  court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=31}} Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This may be to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}}|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\nThe theory has been disproven from the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C. Marani's theory in 2000,{{sfn|Marani|2000|p=165}} [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[lute|lutist]], actor, lyricist and singer, has been the most widely accepted identity of the musician.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} In 1482, Migliarotti and Leonardo left [[Florence]] together for [[Milan]] to serve in the court of [[Ludovico Sforza]], the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} Furthermore, Leonardo is thought to have taught Migliarotti the [[lute]] and [[lyre]] and known to be friends.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|Harr\u00e1n|2001}} During the painting's conception, Migliarotti would have been in his late teens or early twenties, making him a fitting candidate to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, in a 1482 inventory from the [[Codex Atlanticus]]{{#tag:ref|Folio 888 recto (ex 324 recto) to be exact.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}} Leonardo listed \"a portrait of Atalante with his face raised.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{#tag:ref|Alternatively translated as: \"a portrait of Atalante with his upturned face.\"{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} or \"a head portrayed from Atalante who raises his face.\"{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}|group=n}} This has been considered by many to have been some kind of study or start of the later ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}\n\nThe only issues with this theory are that the subject's face is not raised, as Leonardo wrote in his notes, and this note was written 3 years prior to the earliest estimated date of completion{{#tag:ref||group=n|name=date}} for the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} However, these are by no means outstanding issues, as Leonardo was known to make numerous revisions and often took many years to complete a painting.{{sfn|Kalb|2019}}{{sfn|Selvaggio|2018}}{{#tag:ref|Often, like ''The Portrait of a Musician'', not even finishing his paintings.{{sfn|Cotter|2019}}|group=n}} Therefore, since the widespread rejection of Franchinus Gaffurius as the leading candidate, Migliarotti is now considered the most likely.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}\n\n===Josquin des Prez===\nIn 1972, [[Josquin des Prez]], French singer and composer, was suggested as the subject by [[Belgian]] musicologist, Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Josquin worked in the service of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] during various periods of the 1480s,{{sfn|Macey|2001}} consequently working at the same time as Leonardo.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune proposed that the words on the [[sheet music|musical score]] where the abbreviations of \"Cont,\" \"Cantuz,\" and \"A Z\" appear in reference to the words \"[[Contratenor]],\" \"Cantuz\" and [[Alto|Altuz]]. She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}{{#tag:ref|An example is Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix''.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}}\n\nThis theory has been strongly discredited as the notation in the painting being largely illegible, while many composers of the time were writing the same forms in this manner.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues as those of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making the young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]] unlikely to be Josquin.{{sfn|Macey|2001}}\n\n===Gaspar van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested in 2019 that the sitter's identity is [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, and they likely knew each other due to their shared employer.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to definitely link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n===Others===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}} [[Francesco Canova da Milano]], an Italian [[lute]]nist and composer, has been suggested as the subject since he was an important musician also working in [[Milan]] when Leonardo was there.{{sfn|Wallace}} Additionally, Italian painter [[Leonardo da Pistoia]] has been suggested,{{sfn|Russell|2014}} however, there is no strong evidence to support either of these claims.{{sfn|Wallace}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} Dutch illustrator [[Siegfried Woldhek]] proposed that ''Portrait of a Musician'' is one of three self portraits by Leonardo,{{sfn|Woldhek|2008}} although this theory is considered highly improbable.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nGiven the lack of contemporary records, scholars have proposed various theories. A number believed that the tension in the subject's face is due to intense thought on music that was either just performed, about to be performed or being performed.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} The painting has also been proposed as representative of Leonardo's self proclaimed ideology in the superiority of painting over other art forms like [[poetry]], [[sculpture]] and [[music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}} Leonardo famously declared in the beginning of his uncompleted ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Libro de pittura]]'', \n\n{{Quote\n|text=How Music Ought to be Called the Sister and Junior to Painting. Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a harmony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-1492)\n}}\n\nThese words seemingly disapprove of music for its ephemeral nature, and positions painting as having a materiel, permanent physical quality. This theory suggests that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}}\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was simply moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, it was made as a personal gift for a close friend.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commission a portrait himself.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |authorlink1=Kenneth Clark |last2=Kemp |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Kemp (art historian) |year=1989\n |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |language=English |location=City of Westminster, London, England |isbn=978-0140169829 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXifCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PR99&dq=martin%20kemp%20%22portrait%20of%20a%20musician%22&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref={{sfnRef|Clark|1989}}}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last2=Kolb |editor-first2=Paul |year=2019\n |chapter=Gaspar Depicted?

Until the 20th century it was thought to depict [[Ludovico Sforza]], a [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]] and employer of Leonardo. During a 1904\u20131905 restoration, the removal of overpainting revealed a hand holding [[sheet music]], indicated that the sitter may be a musician.\n\nThe painting has attracted much intrigue and mystery as no contemporary records of its [[commission (art)|commission]] exist. Strong stylistic similarities to other works by Leonardo have secured him at least a partial attribution. The hesitation for a universal consensus in attribution is due to the stiff, rigid and lifeless qualities of the figure's body. While the unfinished nature of the painting may explain this, scholars believe it was likely completed by a [[Leonardeschi| student of Leonardo's]].\n\nThe portrait contains the dark background portrait typical of Leonardo's time in Milan. ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' and ''[[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]]'' are other examples of this, but the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is the only one to still reside in Milan, where it has been housed at the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] since at least 1672. Over the centuries, many Italian musicians and politicians to have been proposed as the sitter. [[Franchinus Gaffurius]] was the most convincing suggestion throughout the 20th century, but scholarly opinion has shifted to [[Atalante Migliorotti]], who has been the leading candidate throughout the 21st century. Other notable suggestions include [[Josquin des Prez]] and [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]] but there is no decisive evidence to confirm any claims.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\nThis painting was made with [[oil painting|oils]] on a [[Juglans#Wood|walnut]] wood panel, a medium which Leonardo had begun to favor at the time of the painting's creation.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} It is, with the exception of the face, largely unfinished and depicts a young man in a bust length, three-quarter position whose his right hand holds a folded [[sheet music|musical score]] of some kind.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} It is reminiscent of his other portraits from his time in [[Milan]], such as the ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' and ''[[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]]'', from their shared black background, while also differing in the angled, rather than profile view.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}\n\n===The musician===\n[[File:Ritratto di musico 02.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Detail of the musical score]]The man has curly shoulder length hair, sporting a red hat on his mostly finished face that intently stares at something outside the spectator's field of vision.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} He wears a tight white undershirt with an unfinished black [[doublet (clothing)|doublet]] and only an [[underpaint]]ed brownish-orange [[Academic stole|stole]].{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} According to Laure Fagnart, these colors are due to poor conservation and some repainting and are likely not the original colors. The doublet was probably originally dark red and the stole bright yellow.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The mouth hints at the start of a smile or suggests that perhaps the man is about to sing or has just sung.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}} A notable feature of the musician's face is the effect on his eyes from the light outside the frame. The light causes both eyes to be dilated but the left eye to a far greater extent than the right, something that is not humanly possible. Some defend Leonardo, claiming that this is simply for dramatic effect, so the viewer feels a sense of motion from the musician's left to right side of his face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=239}}\n\n===The musical score===\nThe stiffly folded piece of paper is held in an odd and delicate manner and is at least one part of a [[sheet music|musical score]], with [[musical notes]] and letters written on it.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} Due to the poor [[art conservation|conservation]] of the lower part of the painting, the notes and letters are largely illegible.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} This has not stopped various scholars from hypothesizing as to what the letters say, often using their interpretations to support their theory of the musician's identity.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} The notes on the other hand have offered little clarity into the painting, other than strongly suggesting the subject to be a musician.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} The notes are also undoubtedly in [[mensural notation]] and therefore likely representative of [[polyphonic music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=73}} Drawings from [[Royal Library, Windsor|Royal Library of Windsor]] with Leonardo's own music notational style do not share a resemblance to the music in the painting.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}} Suggesting that the music is not by him, which leaves the composer and the significance of the music, unknown.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}\n\n==History==\n===Attribution and date===\n[[File:Portrait of a Lady - Ambrogio de Predis.png|thumb|upright=1.0|''Portrait of a Lady'' by [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]]. Originally thought to also be by Leonardo and paired with ''Portrait of a Musician'']]\t\nWhile once controversial, modern scholars generally agree that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is by Leonardo da Vinci.{{sfn|Brown|1983|p=105}}{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Kemp|2003}} This controversy stemmed from the rigid and stoicness of the painting,{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}} something which scholars address by proposing that the clothing and torso were done by a [[Leonardeschi| student of his]], perhaps [[Giovanni Antonio Boltraffio]] or [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]].{{sfn|Wallace}}{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}} But it is universally agreed that if Leonardo did not create the whole painting, then he at least painted the face.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}}\n\nWhile no recording of a [[commission (art)|commission]] exists,{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=237}} this attribution comes from various stylistic similarities to Leonardo's other works, notably the angel and St. Jerome's face from ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and ''[[Saint Jerome in the Wilderness]]'' respectively, as well as the portrait having hair reminiscent of that in [[Ginevra de' Benci]].{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}} The dark background of the portrait, a style popularized by Leonardo, furthers this attribution as it appears in other portraits from his time in Milan, such as ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' and ''[[La Belle Ferronni\u00e8re]]''.{{sfn|Kemp|2003}} The shared quality of these portraits suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' was likely done in Milan as well, meaning after 1482, the year he arrived there. Leonardo's lack of anatomical detail suggests that the ''Portrait of a Musician'' is from before 1490, the year where he would engage in a study of the [[anatomy|human body structure]], especially the [[skull]]. In fact, the later ''Lady with an Ermine'' from 1489-1490, is representative of this newly gained dedication to accuracy in painting the human form, further suggesting the painting to be from before 1490. It can be further narrowed down due to the similarity in treatment of [[chiaroscuro]] from works in the mid 1840s, such ''[[Virgin of the Rocks]]'' and sketches for a [[Leonardo's horse|bronze horse sculpture]] making the painting safe to date to 1895-1890.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}}{{sfn|Clark|1989|p=99}}\n\n===Ambrosiana===\nThis is Leonardo's only portrait to remain in Milan, and was catalogued into the [[Pinacoteca Ambrosiana]] in 1672. Its whereabouts before are unknown but it was listed with a description of being \"the face of the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]], with such elegance, that perhaps the living Duke would have wanted it for himself,\" which implied the subject to be [[Ludovico Sforza]], the duke at the time.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} The theory was that it was a counterpart to the ''Portrait of a Lady'', now attributed to [[Giovanni Ambrogio de Predis]], but at the time was thought to be a Leonardo portrait of [[Beatrix d'Este|Beatrice d'Este]], Ludovico's wife.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\nThese assumptions were taken without question until [[Luigi Cavenaghi]]'s 1904\u20131905 [[Conservation and restoration of paintings|restoration]] removed a layer of black paint and revealed a hand holding a [[sheet music|musical score]],{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=74}} which led to the identification of the subject as a musician.{{sfn|Z\u00f6llner|2015|p=45}} Since this discovery, numerous candidates have been proposed as the sitter.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Possible subjects==\n{{multiple image|total_width=300\n|image1=Portrait of a Youth in Profile - Francesco Napoletano.jpg\n|image2=Bust of a Youth in Profile - Leonardo da Vinci.jpg\n|footer=Two drawings, thought to depict the same person as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.

Scholars at the [[National Gallery]] have suggested that [[Francesco Napoletano]]'s drawing of ''Portrait of a Youth in Profile'' and Leonardo's drawing of a ''Bust of a Youth in Profile'' depict the same figure as the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|National Gallery|2011|p=5}} However the identity of the sitter himself remains unknown and not only have various candidates been proposed but even the idea that the subject is simply anonymous has also been explored.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n===Franchinus Gaffurius===\nThroughout the 20th century, the leading candidate, suggested by [[Luca Beltrami]] in 1906, was [[Franchinus Gaffurius]], a priest, music theorist and  court musician for [[Ludovico Sforza]] and ''[[maestro di cappella]]'' of [[Milan Cathedral]].{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} Gaffurius and Leonardo were known to have been friends, both entering the Duke's service only a year or two apart from each other. In fact, Gaffurius' celebrated 1496 music treatise, ''Practica Musica'', contains various [[woodcuts]] by Leonardo.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=31}} Additionally, the letters \"Cant\" and \"Ang\" have been deciphered on the sheet music which could by an abbreviation for Cantum Angelicum. This may be to be in reference to ''Angelicum ac divinum opus'', a music treatise published in 1508.{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}}\n\n<imagemap>\nImage:Portrait of a Musician Candidates.jpg|thumb|left|alt=''Portrait of a Musician'' and four proposed candidates of the subject.|Sforza, Gaffurius, Josquin and Galeazzo.{{#tag:ref|This portrait, by [[Andrea Solari]], has often been suggested to be [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin|Galeazzo di Sanseverino]], another candidate for the sitter in Leonardo's painting.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}}|group=n}} (Left to right, ''Portrait of a Musician'' center) have each been proposed as the subject. <small>''(Clickable image\u2014use cursor to identify.)''</small>\npoly 10 10 218 10 218 192 150 192 149 278 10 278 [[Ludovico Sforza]]\npoly 220 10 424 10 424 278 284 278 284 192 220 192 [[Franchinus Gaffurius]]\nrect 150 192 284 372[[Portrait of a Musician]]\npoly 10 282 149 282 149 380 218 380 218 554 10 554 [[Josquin des Prez]]\npoly 284 282 424 282 424 554 220 554 220 380 284 372 [[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]]\n</imagemap>\nThe theory has been disproven from the treatise being published at least 18 years after the painting's creation and no physical descriptions from Gaffurius' lifetime matching the ''Portrait of a Musician.''{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Also, the issues of Gaffurius, a priest, not being depicted in [[Clerical clothing|clerical robe]] and that Gaffurius would have been in his mid thirties at the time, make him likely too old to be the young man of the painting.{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|pp=31\u201332}}\n\n===Atalante Migliorotti===\nSince Pietro C. Marani's theory in 2000,{{sfn|Marani|2000|p=165}} [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a [[Tuscany|Tuscan]] [[lute|lutist]], actor, lyricist and singer, has been the most widely accepted identity of the musician.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} In 1482, Migliarotti and Leonardo left [[Florence]] together for [[Milan]] to serve in the court of [[Ludovico Sforza]], the [[List of rulers of Milan|Duke of Milan]].{{sfn|Silvestri|2009|p=26}} Furthermore, Leonardo is thought to have taught Migliarotti the [[lute]] and [[lyre]] and known to be friends.{{sfn|Palmer|2018|p=122}}{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}{{sfn|Harr\u00e1n|2001}} During the painting's conception, Migliarotti would have been in his late teens or early twenties, making him a fitting candidate to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, in a 1482 inventory from the [[Codex Atlanticus]]{{#tag:ref|Folio 888 recto (ex 324 recto) to be exact.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}} Leonardo listed \"a portrait of Atalante with his face raised.\"{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{#tag:ref|Alternatively translated as: \"a portrait of Atalante with his upturned face.\"{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|pp=75\u201376}} or \"a head portrayed from Atalante who raises his face.\"{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}|group=n}} This has been considered by many to have been some kind of study or start of the later ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}\n\nThe only issues with this theory are that the subject's face is not raised, as Leonardo wrote in his notes, and this note was written 3 years prior to the earliest estimated date of completion{{#tag:ref||group=n|name=date}} for the ''Portrait of a Musician''.{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} However, these are by no means outstanding issues, as Leonardo was known to make numerous revisions and often took many years to complete a painting.{{sfn|Kalb|2019}}{{sfn|Selvaggio|2018}}{{#tag:ref|Often, like ''The Portrait of a Musician'', not even finishing his paintings.{{sfn|Cotter|2019}}|group=n}} Therefore, since the widespread rejection of Franchinus Gaffurius as the leading candidate, Migliarotti is now considered the most likely.{{sfn|Bambach|2012|p=83}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}}{{sfn|Blackburn|2001}}\n\n===Josquin des Prez===\nIn 1972, [[Josquin des Prez]], French singer and composer, was suggested as the subject by [[Belgian]] musicologist, Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Josquin worked in the service of the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] during various periods of the 1480s,{{sfn|Macey|2001}} consequently working at the same time as Leonardo.{{sfn|Pinacoteca Ambrosiana}} Suzanne Clercx-Lejeune proposed that the words on the [[sheet music|musical score]] where the abbreviations of \"Cont,\" \"Cantuz,\" and \"A Z\" appear in reference to the words \"[[Contratenor]],\" \"Cantuz\" and [[Alto|Altuz]]. She claimed that this meant they were associated with a song with a descending melodic line, such as [[Mass (music)|masses]], [[motets]] and songs by Josquin.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}{{#tag:ref|An example is Josquin's motet ''Illibata Dei Virgo nutrix''.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}|group=n}}\n\nThis theory has been strongly discredited as the notation in the painting being largely illegible, while many composers of the time were writing the same forms in this manner.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} Additionally, this theory runs into the same issues as those of Gaffurius', in that Josquin was also a priest in his mid 30s at the time, making the young man depicted without [[Clerical clothing|clerical robes]] unlikely to be Josquin.{{sfn|Macey|2001}}\n\n===Gaspar van Weerbeke===\nLaure Fagnart suggested in 2019 that the sitter's identity is [[Gaspar van Weerbeke]], a [[Netherlandish]] composer and singer. Gaspar worked for the [[House of Sforza|Sforza family]] at the same time as Leonardo, and they likely knew each other due to their shared employer.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} This theory cites letters from [[Galeazzo Maria Sforza]] to Gotardo Panigarola concerning the attire of musicians for the court, with one stating, \"Gotardo. To Gaspar, our singer, we would like to give a dark velvet robe, such as you have given to the Abbot [Antonio Guinati] and to Cordier, both of them also our sing-ers.\" As Fagnart points out, this letter is too vague to definitely link Gaspar to the portrait, additionally, Gaspar runs into the same issue as Gaffurius and Josquin, as he would have also been in his 30s and probably too old to be the young man in the painting.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}}\n\n===Others===\n[[Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin]] has been suggested as the sitter, since Leonardo lived with him while in Milan. Not only is there no direct evidence to support this, but the uncovering of the musical score makes this very unlikely as Gal\u00e9as de Saint-S\u00e9verin was not known to be a musician.{{sfn|Shephard|2019}} [[Francesco Canova da Milano]], an Italian [[lute]]nist and composer, has been suggested as the subject since he was an important musician also working in [[Milan]] when Leonardo was there.{{sfn|Wallace}} Additionally, Italian painter [[Leonardo da Pistoia]] has been suggested,{{sfn|Russell|2014}} however, there is no strong evidence to support either of these claims.{{sfn|Wallace}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=76}} Dutch illustrator [[Siegfried Woldhek]] proposed that ''Portrait of a Musician'' is one of three self portraits by Leonardo,{{sfn|Woldhek|2008}} although this theory is considered highly improbable.{{sfn|Pooler|2014|p=32}}\n\n==Interpretation==\nGiven the lack of contemporary records, scholars have proposed various theories. A number believed that the tension in the subject's face is due to intense thought on music that was either just performed, about to be performed or being performed.{{sfn|Pedretti|1982|p=68}}{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}} The painting has also been proposed as representative of Leonardo's self proclaimed ideology in the superiority of painting over other art forms like [[poetry]], [[sculpture]] and [[music]].{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}} Leonardo famously declared in the beginning of his uncompleted ''[[A Treatise on Painting|Libro de pittura]]'', \n\n{{Quote\n|text=How Music Ought to be Called the Sister and Junior to Painting. Music is to be re-garded none other than the sitter of painting since it is subject to hearing, a sense second to the eye, and since it composes harmony from the conjunction of its proportional parts operating at the same time. [These parts] are constrained to arise and to die in one or more harmonic tempos which surround a proportionality by its members; such a harmony is composed not differently from the circumferential lines which generate human beauty by its [respective] members. Yet painting excels and rules over music, because it does not immediately die after its creation the way unfortunately music does. To the contrary, painting stays in existence, and will show you as being alive what is, in fact, on a single surface. \n|author=Leonardo da Vinci\n|source=''[[A Treatise on Painting]]'' (1490-1492)\n}}\n\nThese words seemingly disapprove of music for its ephemeral nature, and positions painting as having a materiel, permanent physical quality. This theory suggests that the sadness in the young man's eyes is due to this proposed idea that music simply disappears after a finished performance.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=77}}\n\nAnother interpretation is that Leonardo was simply moved to depict the a young man's beauty and curly hair. But more likely, due to the odd and seemingly intimate aesthetic of the painting, it was made as a personal gift for a close friend.{{sfn|Kemp|2019|p=92}}{{sfn|Isaacson|2017|p=238}} This would fit with a lot of the proposed subjects, especially [[Atalante Migliorotti]], a close friend of Leonardo's and one likely not financially able to commission a portrait himself.{{sfn|Fagnart|2019|p=75}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|group=n|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''Books'''\n*{{cite book |last1=Clark |first1=Kenneth |authorlink1=Kenneth Clark |last2=Kemp |first2=Martin |authorlink2=Martin Kemp (art historian) |year=1989\n |title=Leonardo da Vinci: Revised Edition |edition=2nd |publisher=[[Penguin Books|Penguin]] |language=English |location=City of Westminster, London, England |isbn=978-0140169829 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fXifCgAAQBAJ&lpg=PR99&dq=martin%20kemp%20%22portrait%20of%20a%20musician%22&pg=PP1#v=onepage&q&f=false |ref={{sfnRef|Clark|1989}}}}\n\n*{{cite book |last=Fagnart |first=Laure |editor-last1=Lindmayr-Brandl |editor-first1=Andrea |editor-last2=Kolb |editor-first2=Paul |year=2019\n |chapter=Gaspar Depicted?

It is based on the 2008 novel [[The Hunger Games (novel)|of the same name]] by Collins. The film is the first installment in [[The Hunger Games (film series)|''The Hunger Games'' film series]]. It stars [[Jennifer Lawrence]], [[Josh Hutcherson]], [[Liam Hemsworth]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Elizabeth Banks]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Stanley Tucci]], and [[Donald Sutherland]].<ref name=\"TobyJones\">{{cite web | url= https://www.deadline.com/2011/05/toby-jones-in-the-hunger-games/ | title=Toby Jones In 'The Hunger Games' | last=Fleming | first=Mike | website=[[Deadline Hollywood]] | date=May 24, 2011 | accessdate=May 24, 2011}}</ref> The story takes place in a dystopian [[Apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction|post-apocalyptic]] future in the nation of [[Panem]], where a boy and a girl from each of the nation's 12 Districts are chosen annually as \"tributes\" and forced to compete in The Hunger Games, an elaborate televised fight to the death. [[Katniss Everdeen]] ([[Jennifer Lawrence]]) volunteers to take her younger sister's place, and with her district's male tribute, [[Peeta Mellark]] ([[Josh Hutcherson]]), travels to the Capitol to train and compete in the games.\n\nDevelopment of ''The Hunger Games'' began in March 2009 when [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]] entered into a co-production agreement with [[Color Force]], which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier. Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay. The screenplay expanded the character of [[Seneca Crane]] to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and [[Coriolanus Snow]]. The main characters were cast between March and May 2011. Principal photography began in May 2011 and ended in September 2011, with filming taking place in [[North Carolina]].\n\nThe film was released on March 21, 2012, in some European countries<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=145083.html?nopub=1 |title=Hunger Games \u2013 released |publisher=[[AlloCin\u00e9]].fr|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}</ref> and in the US and UK on March 23, 2012,<ref>{{cite news|first=Karen|last=Valby|url= http://insidemovies.ew.com/2011/01/25/hunger-games-release-date/|title=The Hunger Games' gets a release date |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=January 25, 2011|accessdate=April 6, 2011}}</ref> in both conventional theaters and digital [[IMAX]] theaters.<ref>{{cite web|first=Matt|last=Goldberg|url= https://collider.com/the-hunger-games-imax/142402/|title=The Hunger Games Will Get a One-Week IMAX Run|website = Collider |date=February 2, 2012|accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref> Japan received it last, on September 28.

The film's soundtrack featured the song \"[[Safe & Sound (Taylor Swift song)|Safe & Sound]]\", which was sung by [[Taylor Swift]] featuring [[The Civil Wars]]; it won a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Song Written for Visual Media|Best Song Written for Visual Media]] and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]].

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. Primrose gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only Games winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker Jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta.\n\nCrane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked in a room with nightlock berries.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2015.jpg|thumb|198px|[[Jennifer Lawrence]] wore a dark brown wig to play Katniss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/43990-hows-jennifer-lawrences-wig-in-mockingjay-holding-up-lets-see-here-photos|title=How's J Law's 'Mockingjay' Wig Holding Up?|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n<!--Reordered to match billing of primary source: the film -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/jennifer-lawrence-gets-lead-role-hunger-games-25482 | title=Jennifer Lawrence Gets Lead Role in 'The Hunger Games' | author=Joshua L.

The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross and [[visual effects supervisor]] Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal [[dei ex machina]] Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie?

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, 16-year old [[Katniss Everdeen]] volunteers to take her place. Primrose gives Katniss a mockingjay pin. She and fellow tribute [[Peeta Mellark]] are then escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only Games winner from District 12. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide potentially life-saving gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n\nAt the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of [[The Hunger Games universe#Tracker Jackers|tracker jackers]], genetically modified poisonous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws off the branch holding the nest, causing it to fall on the Careers sleeping below; Glimmer dies, but the others escape. Katniss becomes disoriented from being stung a few times. Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n\nRue helps Katniss recover, and they become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a trap, but Marvel throws a spear at Katniss which impales Rue. Katniss kills him with an arrow. She comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest.\n\nHaymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's vehement opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but she is ambushed and overpowered by Clove, who gloats about Rue's death and prepares to kill her. [[List of The Hunger Games characters#Thresh|Thresh]], District 11's male tribute, overhears and kills Clove. He spares Katniss once, for Rue's sake. The medicine heals Peeta overnight.\n\nWhile hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta, who has unwittingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute, dead from eating what she assumed were edible berries from watching Peeta.\n\nCrane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta, and Cato - the last three survivors - onto the Cornucopia's roof. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n\nCrane then revokes the rule change allowing two victors to win. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him to eat nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked in a room with nightlock berries.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Jennifer Lawrence SDCC 2015.jpg|thumb|198px|[[Jennifer Lawrence]] wore a dark brown wig to play Katniss.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/43990-hows-jennifer-lawrences-wig-in-mockingjay-holding-up-lets-see-here-photos|title=How's J Law's 'Mockingjay' Wig Holding Up?|website=Bustle|language=en|access-date=2020-03-08}}</ref>]]\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games characters}}\n{{See also|List of The Hunger Games cast members}}\n<!--Reordered to match billing of primary source: the film -->\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Jennifer Lawrence]] as [[Katniss Everdeen]]<ref>{{cite news | url= https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/jennifer-lawrence-gets-lead-role-hunger-games-25482 | title=Jennifer Lawrence Gets Lead Role in 'The Hunger Games' | author=Joshua L.

The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\"<ref name=\"nyt-qanda\" /> Ross and [[visual effects supervisor]] Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal [[dei ex machina]] Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie?

Composed with lyrics in the [[Bengali language]], Bengali music spans a wide variety of styles.\n\nThe [[Bengal region]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] is currently split between [[Bangladesh]] and the Indian state of [[West Bengal]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest music in Bengal was influenced by [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] chants, and evolved under the influence of [[Vaishnav]] poetry such as the 13th-century ''[[Gitagovindam]]'' by [[Jayadeva]], whose work continues to be sung in many eastern [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temples. The Middle Ages saw a mixture of Hindu and Islamic trends when the musical tradition was formalized under the patronage of [[Sultan and Nawab]]s and the powerful landlords ''[[Baro Bhuiyans|baro bhuiyans]]''.\n\nMuch of the early canon is devotional, as in the Hindu devotional songs of [[Ramprasad Sen]] a [[bhakti|bhakta]] who captures the Bengali ethos in his poetic, rustic, and ecstatic vision of the Hindu goddess of time and destruction in her motherly incarnation, Ma [[Kali]]. Another writer of the time was Vidyapati. Notable in this devotional poetry is an earthiness that does not distinguish between love in its carnal and devotional forms; some see connections between this and [[Tantra]], which originated sometime in the middle of the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]].\n\n==Forms==\n\n===Bishnupur Gharana===\n{{Main|Bishnupur Gharana}}\n\nThe Bishnupur Gharana is the sole Classical (Drupad) gharana of Bengal. It originated in Bishnupur, Bankura by the court musicians of the Malla Kings. Bahadur Khan of Delhi, a descendant of the Tansen, was the father of Bishnupur Gharana. Bahadur Khan was brought to Bishnupur by Malla King Raghunath Singha II.\n\n===Baul===\n{{Main|Baul}}\n\nThe [[Baul]]s (meaning \"divinely inspired insanity\") are a group of mystic minstrels (Muslim Sufis and Hindu Baishnos) from the Bengal region, who sang primarily in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are thought to have been influenced greatly by the Hindu tantric sect of the [[Kartabhaja]]s as well as by Muslim [[Sufi]] philosophers. Bauls traveled and sang in search of the internal ideal, ''[[Moner Manush]]'' (''Man of the Heart'' or the ''inner being''), and described \"superfluous\" differences between religions. [[Lalon Fakir]], alternatively known as Lalon Shah, who lived in the 19th century in and around [[Kushtia]], is considered to be the greatest of all bauls.\n\n===Rabindra Sangeet===\n{{Main|Rabindra Sangeet}}\n\nThe leading proponent of Bengali music is [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (known in Bengali as ''Robi Thakur'' and ''Gurudeb'', the latter meaning \"Respected Teacher\" (in the Bengal of that time, the suffix 'deb' was an honorific, ascribed to people who enjoyed immense respect, but this title was primarily used by his students at Santiniketan, though many others did use the address/<ref>{{cite book|last1=Devi|first1=Maitreyi|authorlink=Maitreyi Devi|title=Na Hanyate|date=May 1983|publisher=Upama Sengupta; Prima Publications|location=Kolkata|pages=1, 23, 59|edition=First Edition, Seventh Reprint}}</ref>) Tagore was a prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit.<ref name=\"DasguptaGuha2013\">{{cite book|author1=Sanjukta Dasgupta|author2=Chinmoy Guha|title=Tagore-At Home in the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zfX4llLjyUC|date=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-1084-2|page=254}}</ref> His songs are known as ''[[Rabindra Sangeet|rabindrasangit]]'' (\"Tagore Song\"), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which\u2014poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike\u2014were lyricised. Influenced by the ''[[thumri]]'' style of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani music]], they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta |Robinson|1997|p=94}} They emulated the tonal colour of classical ''[[raga]]s'' to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different ''ragas''.<ref name=\"dasgupta2001\">{{Citation|last=Dasgupta |first=Anirban|publication-date=15 July 2001|year=2001|title=Rabindra-Sangeet as a Resource for Indian Classical ''Bandishes''|periodical=Parabaas|url=http://www.parabaas.com/rabindranath/articles/pAnirban1.html|accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref> Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not ''bhanga gaan'', the body of tunes revamped with \"fresh value\" from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours \"external\" to Tagore's own ancestral culture.<ref name=\"ghosh2011\">{{Citation|last=Ghosh |first=Bhaswati|title=Inside the World of Tagore's Music|periodical=Parabaas|publication-date=August 2011|year=2011|url=http://www.parabaas.com/rabindranath/articles/pBhaswati2.html|accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref> His music is an exemplary instance of 'kavya-geeti', a style of composition that later found widespread use in the music industries at Bombay and Calcutta.\n\nIn 1971, ''[[Amar Shonar Bangla]]'' became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was written \u2014 ironically \u2014 to protest the [[1905 Partition of Bengal]] along communal lines: cutting off the Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a cunning plan to stop the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]], and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' was written in ''[[shadhu-bhasha]]'', a Sanskritised form of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of the Brahmo hymn ''[[Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata]]'' that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the [[Indian National Congress]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Tagore and Jana Gana Mana|url=http://www.countercurrents.org/comm-chatterjee310803.htm|publisher=countercurrents.org|author=Monish R. Chatterjee|date=13 August 2003}}</ref> and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.\n\nFor Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that the ''Modern Review'' observed that \"[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs\".{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=359}} Tagore influenced ''sitar'' maestro [[Vilayat Khan]] and ''[[sarod]]iyas'' [[Buddhadev Dasgupta]] and [[Amjad Ali Khan]].<ref name=\"dasgupta2001\" />\n\nMost of his musical poems are detailed in two series of books \u2013 the ''[[Gitabitan]]'' (that only has the texts of the poems) and the ''Swarabitan'' (that has the poems and their musical notation). However, there exist several poems of his that are set to music, and yet find no mention in either of the above. These are handed down from his students to their students and so on.\n\nSome of the notable exponents of Rabindrasangeet are [[Shantideb Ghosh]],  [[Debabrata Biswas]], [[Pankaj Kumar Mullick]], [[Kalim Sharafi]], [[Kanika Bandyopadhyay]], [[Rajeshwari Datta]], [[Malati Ghoshal]], [[Nilima Sen]], [[Suchitra Mitra]], [[Aditi Mohsin]], [[Rezwana Choudhury Bannya]], [[Subinoy Roy]], [[Chinmoy Chattopadhyay|Chinmoy Chatterjee]], [[Hemanta Kumar Mukhopadhyay|Hemanta Mukhopadhyay]], [[Dwijen Mukhopadhyay]], [[Sagar Sen]], [[Santosh Thakur]], [[Purabi Mukhopadhyay]], [[Kabir Suman]],  [[Banani Ghosh]], [[Mita Haque]],  [[Indrani Sen]], [[Srikanto Acharya]], [[ Shreya Guhathakurta]] [[Sahana Bajpaie]] and [[Mohan Singh]].\n\n===Nazrul Geeti===\n{{Main|Nazrul Geeti}}\n\nAnother influential body of work is that of [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], which constitutes what is known as [[Complete Works of Kazi Nazrul Islam|Nazrul geeti]].Some of the notable Nazrulgeeti singers from India include Suprova Sircar, Dhirendra Chandra Mitra, [[Manabendra Mukhopadhyay]], Dr. Anjali Mukhopadhyay, Dhiren Bose, Adhir Bagchi, Purabi Dutta, [[Firoza Begum (singer)|Firoza Begum]], [[Anup Ghoshal]], and, Bangladeshi singer [[Sohrab Hossain]].\n\n===Shyama Sangeet===\n{{Main|Shyama Sangeet}}\n\nShyama Sangeet is a genre of Bengali devotional songs dedicated to the Hindu goddess Shyama or [[Kali]] which is a form of supreme universal mother-goddess Durga or parvati. It is also known as Shaktagiti or Durgastuti. Shyama Sangeet appeals to the common man because it is a musical representation of the relationship of eternal and sublime love and care between the mother and her child. It is free of the common rituals of worship and also the esoteric practice of the Tantra. A notable singer is [[Pannalal Bhattacharya]].\n\n===Dwijendrageeti===\n{{Main|Dwijendralal Ray}}\n\nDwijendralal Ray's Dwijendrageeti (the Songs of Dwijendralal), which number over 500, create a separate subgenre of Bengali music. Two of Dwijendralal Ray's most famous compositions are Dhana Dhanya Pushpa Bhara and Banga Amar Janani Amar. Ray is regarded as one of the most important figures in early modern Bengali literature.\n\n===Atulprasadi===\n{{Main|Atul Prasad Sen}}\n\nAtulprasadi, one of the major lyricist and composers of early-modern period, is also widely popular\nin Paschimbanga.  Atul Prasad is credited with introducing the Thumri style in Bengali music. His songs centred on three broad subjects: patriotism, devotion and love.\n\n===Prabhat Samgiita===\n{{Main|Prabhat Samgiita}}\n\nPrabh\u00e1t Sa\u1e3fgiita also known as Songs of a New Dawn and Prabhat Songs, are songs composed by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar. Sarkar composed a total of 5,018 songs including the lyrics and the tune, in a period of eight years from 1982 until his death in 1990, making using of eight different languages: Bengali, Hindi, English, Sanskrit, Urdu, Magahi, Maithili and Angika.\n\n===Other===\n\n*[[Bhatiali]]\n*[[Bhawaiya]]\n*[[Dhamail]]\n*[[Gombhira]]\n*[[Kavigan]], poems sung with simple music usually presented on stage as a musical battle between poets.\n*[[Jatra (Bengal)|Jatra]] Pala, songs associated exclusively with plays (performed on-stage). Usually involves colourful presentations of historical themes.\n\nNumerous other poets and composers had laid the foundation for the rich repertoire of Bengali music in the 19th century and early 20th century. Some stalwarts of this ear include Ramnidhi Gupta (commonly known as [[Nidhu Babu]]), [[Lalon Fakir]], [[Atulprasad Sen]], [[Dwijendralal Ray]], [[Rajanikanta Sen]] and a large canon of patriotic songs from India's Independence movement.<ref name=\"ch\">Chatterjee, Gita.

Composed with lyrics in the [[Bengali language]], Bengali music spans a wide variety of styles.\n\nThe [[Bengal region]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]] is currently split between [[Bangladesh]] and the Indian state of [[West Bengal]].\n\n== History ==\n\nThe earliest music in Bengal was influenced by [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]] chants, and evolved under the influence of [[Vaishnav]] poetry such as the 13th-century ''[[Gitagovindam]]'' by [[Jayadeva]], whose work continues to be sung in many eastern [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temples. The Middle Ages saw a mixture of Hindu and Islamic trends when the musical tradition was formalized under the patronage of [[Sultan and Nawab]]s and the powerful landlords ''[[Baro Bhuiyans|baro bhuiyans]]''.\n\nMuch of the early canon is devotional, as in the Hindu devotional songs of [[Ramprasad Sen]] a [[bhakti|bhakta]] who captures the Bengali ethos in his poetic, rustic, and ecstatic vision of the Hindu goddess of time and destruction in her motherly incarnation, Ma [[Kali]]. Another writer of the time was Vidyapati. Notable in this devotional poetry is an earthiness that does not distinguish between love in its carnal and devotional forms; some see connections between this and [[Tantra]], which originated sometime in the middle of the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]].\n\n==Forms==\n\n===Bishnupur Gharana===\n{{Main|Bishnupur Gharana}}\n\nThe Bishnupur Gharana is the sole Classical (Drupad) gharana of Bengal. It originated in Bishnupur, Bankura by the court musicians of the Malla Kings. Bahadur Khan of Delhi, a descendant of the Tansen, was the father of Bishnupur Gharana. Bahadur Khan was brought to Bishnupur by Malla King Raghunath Singha II.\n\n===Baul===\n{{Main|Baul}}\n\nThe [[Baul]]s (meaning \"divinely inspired insanity\") are a group of mystic minstrels (Muslim Sufis and Hindu Baishnos) from the Bengal region, who sang primarily in the 17th and 18th centuries. They are thought to have been influenced greatly by the Hindu tantric sect of the [[Kartabhaja]]s as well as by Muslim [[Sufi]] philosophers. Bauls traveled and sang in search of the internal ideal, ''[[Moner Manush]]'' (''Man of the Heart'' or the ''inner being''), and described \"superfluous\" differences between religions. [[Lalon Fakir]], alternatively known as Lalon Shah, who lived in the 19th century in and around [[Kushtia]], is considered to be the greatest of all bauls.\n\n===Rabindra Sangeet===\n{{Main|Rabindra Sangeet}}\n\nThe leading proponent of Bengali music is [[Rabindranath Tagore]] (known in Bengali as ''Robi Thakur'' and ''Gurudeb'', the latter meaning \"Respected Teacher\" (in the Bengal of that time, the suffix 'deb' was an honorific, ascribed to people who enjoyed immense respect, but this title was primarily used by his students at Santiniketan, though many others did use the address/<ref>{{cite book|last1=Devi|first1=Maitreyi|authorlink=Maitreyi Devi|title=Na Hanyate|date=May 1983|publisher=Upama Sengupta; Prima Publications|location=Kolkata|pages=1, 23, 59|edition=First Edition, Seventh Reprint}}</ref>) Tagore was a prolific composer with around 2,230 songs to his credit.<ref name=\"DasguptaGuha2013\">{{cite book|author1=Sanjukta Dasgupta|author2=Chinmoy Guha|title=Tagore-At Home in the World|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8zfX4llLjyUC|date=2013|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-81-321-1084-2|page=254}}</ref> His songs are known as ''[[Rabindra Sangeet|rabindrasangit]]'' (\"Tagore Song\"), which merges fluidly into his literature, most of which\u2014poems or parts of novels, stories, or plays alike\u2014were lyricised. Influenced by the ''[[thumri]]'' style of [[Hindustani classical music|Hindustani music]], they ran the entire gamut of human emotion, ranging from his early dirge-like Brahmo devotional hymns to quasi-erotic compositions.{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta |Robinson|1997|p=94}} They emulated the tonal colour of classical ''[[raga]]s'' to varying extents. Some songs mimicked a given raga's melody and rhythm faithfully; others newly blended elements of different ''ragas''.<ref name=\"dasgupta2001\">{{Citation|last=Dasgupta |first=Anirban|publication-date=15 July 2001|year=2001|title=Rabindra-Sangeet as a Resource for Indian Classical ''Bandishes''|periodical=Parabaas|url=http://www.parabaas.com/rabindranath/articles/pAnirban1.html|accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref> Yet about nine-tenths of his work was not ''bhanga gaan'', the body of tunes revamped with \"fresh value\" from select Western, Hindustani, Bengali folk and other regional flavours \"external\" to Tagore's own ancestral culture.<ref name=\"ghosh2011\">{{Citation|last=Ghosh |first=Bhaswati|title=Inside the World of Tagore's Music|periodical=Parabaas|publication-date=August 2011|year=2011|url=http://www.parabaas.com/rabindranath/articles/pBhaswati2.html|accessdate=17 September 2011}}</ref> His music is an exemplary instance of 'kavya-geeti', a style of composition that later found widespread use in the music industries at Bombay and Calcutta.\n\nIn 1971, ''[[Amar Shonar Bangla]]'' became the national anthem of Bangladesh. It was written \u2014 ironically \u2014 to protest the [[1905 Partition of Bengal]] along communal lines: cutting off the Muslim-majority East Bengal from Hindu-dominated West Bengal was to avert a regional bloodbath. Tagore saw the partition as a cunning plan to stop the [[Indian independence movement|independence movement]], and he aimed to rekindle Bengali unity and tar communalism. ''[[Jana Gana Mana]]'' was written in ''[[shadhu-bhasha]]'', a Sanskritised form of Bengali, and is the first of five stanzas of the Brahmo hymn ''[[Bharot Bhagyo Bidhata]]'' that Tagore composed. It was first sung in 1911 at a Calcutta session of the [[Indian National Congress]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Tagore and Jana Gana Mana|url=http://www.countercurrents.org/comm-chatterjee310803.htm|publisher=countercurrents.org|author=Monish R. Chatterjee|date=13 August 2003}}</ref> and was adopted in 1950 by the Constituent Assembly of the Republic of India as its national anthem.\n\nFor Bengalis, the songs' appeal, stemming from the combination of emotive strength and beauty described as surpassing even Tagore's poetry, was such that the ''Modern Review'' observed that \"[t]here is in Bengal no cultured home where Rabindranath's songs are not sung or at least attempted to be sung... Even illiterate villagers sing his songs\".{{Sfn|Tagore|Dutta|Robinson|1997|p=359}} Tagore influenced ''sitar'' maestro [[Vilayat Khan]] and ''[[sarod]]iyas'' [[Buddhadev Dasgupta]] and [[Amjad Ali Khan]].<ref name=\"dasgupta2001\" />\n\nMost of his musical poems are detailed in two series of books \u2013 the ''[[Gitabitan]]'' (that only has the texts of the poems) and the ''Swarabitan'' (that has the poems and their musical notation). However, there exist several poems of his that are set to music, and yet find no mention in either of the above. These are handed down from his students to their students and so on.\n\nSome of the notable exponents of Rabindrasangeet are [[Shantideb Ghosh]],  [[Debabrata Biswas]], [[Pankaj Kumar Mullick]], [[Kalim Sharafi]], [[Kanika Bandyopadhyay]], [[Rajeshwari Datta]], [[Malati Ghoshal]], [[Nilima Sen]], [[Suchitra Mitra]], [[Aditi Mohsin]], [[Rezwana Choudhury Bannya]], [[Subinoy Roy]], [[Chinmoy Chattopadhyay|Chinmoy Chatterjee]], [[Hemanta Kumar Mukhopadhyay|Hemanta Mukhopadhyay]], [[Dwijen Mukhopadhyay]], [[Sagar Sen]], [[Santosh Thakur]], [[Purabi Mukhopadhyay]], [[Kabir Suman]],  [[Banani Ghosh]], [[Mita Haque]],  [[Indrani Sen]], [[Srikanto Acharya]], [[ Shreya Guhathakurta]] [[Sahana Bajpaie]] and [[Mohan Singh]].\n\n===Nazrul Geeti===\n{{Main|Nazrul Geeti}}\n\nAnother influential body of work is that of [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]], which constitutes what is known as [[Complete Works of Kazi Nazrul Islam|Nazrul geeti]].Some of the notable Nazrulgeeti singers from India include Suprova Sircar, Dhirendra Chandra Mitra, [[Manabendra Mukhopadhyay]], Dr. Anjali Mukhopadhyay, Dhiren Bose, Adhir Bagchi, Purabi Dutta, [[Firoza Begum (singer)|Firoza Begum]], [[Anup Ghoshal]], and, Bangladeshi singer [[Sohrab Hossain]].\n\n===Shyama Sangeet===\n{{Main|Shyama Sangeet}}\n\nShyama Sangeet is a genre of Bengali devotional songs dedicated to the Hindu goddess Shyama or [[Kali]] which is a form of supreme universal mother-goddess Durga or parvati. It is also known as Shaktagiti or Durgastuti. Shyama Sangeet appeals to the common man because it is a musical representation of the relationship of eternal and sublime love and care between the mother and her child. It is free of the common rituals of worship and also the esoteric practice of the Tantra. A notable singer is [[Pannalal Bhattacharya]].\n\n===Dwijendrageeti===\n{{Main|Dwijendralal Ray}}\n\nDwijendralal Ray's Dwijendrageeti (the Songs of Dwijendralal), which number over 500, create a separate subgenre of Bengali music. Two of Dwijendralal Ray's most famous compositions are Dhana Dhanya Pushpa Bhara and Banga Amar Janani Amar. Ray is regarded as one of the most important figures in early modern Bengali literature.\n\n===Atulprasadi===\n{{Main|Atul Prasad Sen}}\n\nAtulprasadi, one of the major lyricist and composers of early-modern period, is also widely popular\nin Paschimbanga.  Atul Prasad is credited with introducing the Thumri style in Bengali music. His songs centred on three broad subjects: patriotism, devotion and love.\n\n===Prabhat Samgiita===\n{{Main|Prabhat Samgiita}}\n\nPrabh\u00e1t Sa\u1e3fgiita also known as Songs of a New Dawn and Prabhat Songs, are songs composed by Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar. Sarkar composed a total of 5,018 songs including the lyrics and the tune, in a period of eight years from 1982 until his death in 1990, making using of eight different languages: Bengali, Hindi, English, Sanskrit, Urdu, Magahi, Maithili and Angika.\n\n===Other===\n\n*[[Bhatiali]]\n*[[Bhawaiya]]\n*[[Dhamail]]\n*[[Gombhira]]\n*[[Kavigan]], poems sung with simple music usually presented on stage as a musical battle between poets.\n*[[Jatra (Bengal)|Jatra]] Pala, songs associated exclusively with plays (performed on-stage). Usually involves colourful presentations of historical themes.\n\nNumerous other poets and composers had laid the foundation for the rich repertoire of Bengali music in the 19th century and early 20th century. Some stalwarts of this ear include Ramnidhi Gupta (commonly known as [[Nidhu Babu]]), [[Lalon Fakir]], [[Atulprasad Sen]], [[Dwijendralal Ray]], [[Rajanikanta Sen]] and a large canon of patriotic songs from India's Independence movement.<ref name=\"ch\">Chatterjee, Gita.
