Gmail's design for the pile of poo emoji lacked a face and was circled above by animated flies. When deciding which emoji to include, Takeshi Kishimoto, Google's Japanese product manager, went directly to the manager of Gmail and convinced him that the pile of poo emoji was the \"most useful\" emoji. This was corroborated by a statistical analysis undertaken by Google to determine which emoji were the most popular among Japanese users. According to Google software engineer Darren Lewis the pile of poo emoji was \"way up there\" in terms of popularity. Design for the emoji was left to [[Google Doodle]] artists Ryan Germick and Susie Sahim, who sought to put a \"Google spin\" on the existing emojis.

When deciding which emoji to include, Takeshi Kishimoto, Google's Japanese product manager, went directly to the manager of Gmail and convinced him that the pile of poo emoji was the \"most useful\" emoji. This was corroborated by a statistical analysis undertaken by Google to determine which emoji were the most popular among Japanese users. According to Google software engineer Darren Lewis the pile of poo emoji was \"way up there\" in terms of popularity. Design for the emoji was left to [[Google Doodle]] artists Ryan Germick and Susie Sahim, who sought to put a \"Google spin\" on the existing emojis.

He correctly deduced that these resources were being extracted from the population by force and began to campaign to expose the abuses. In collaboration with [[Roger Casement]], Morel led a campaign against slavery in the [[Congo Free State]], founding the [[Congo Reform Association]] and running the ''West African Mail''. With the help of celebrities such as [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[Mark Twain]], the movement successfully pressured the Belgian King [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] to sell the Congo Free State to the Belgian government, ending some of the human rights abuses perpetrated under his rule.\n \t\t \t\nMorel played a significant role in the British [[pacifism|pacifist]] movement during the [[First World War]], participating in the foundation of and becoming secretary of the [[Union of Democratic Control]], at which point he broke with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. In 1917, he was jailed for six months for his antiwar activism, which had a permanent effect on his health. After the war, he edited the journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', through which he sharply criticized what he considered French aggression and mistreatment of the defeated [[Central Powers]]. As part of his campaign against the French, he became the most important English proponent of the racist [[Black shame|Black Shame]] campaign, which accused black French troops of outrages against the population of the occupied [[Rhineland]].\n\nMorel was elected to Parliament in 1922 as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate, defeating the incumbent [[Winston Churchill]] for his seat, and was reelected in 1924, dying in office. Morel collaborated closely with future prime minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and was considered for the post of [[Foreign Secretary]], though he ultimately acted only as an unofficial adviser to MacDonald's government.\n\n==Background==\nMorel was born in the [[Avenue d'Eylau]], Paris. His father, Edmond Pierre Marie Morel de Ville, was a French civil servant; his mother, Eliza Emmeline de Horne, was from an English [[Quaker]] family.  Edmond died when the boy was four, leaving no pension,<ref>Hochschild, Adam. ''King Leopold's Ghost''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1998. p. 177.</ref> and Emmeline subsequently fell out with her late husband's family. As a consequence, Emmeline changed her name to Deville and raised her son on her own. To remove her son from the family's influence, she worked as a teacher so that she could send him to boarding school at both Madras House school in [[Eastbourne]] and later at [[Bedford Modern School]].\n\nWhen Emmeline Deville fell ill in 1888, the money for school fees was no longer available and Edmund was forced to return to Paris to work as a bank clerk.<ref>Hochschild, p. 177.</ref> He was able to move his mother back to Britain in 1891. Five years later he successfully applied for naturalisation as a British subject and [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] his name. He married Mary Richardson that same year; they had five children. His daughter Stella married the Polish political advisor [[Joseph Retinger]] in 1926; they had two daughters.\n\n==Congo activism==\n{{further|Atrocities in the Congo Free State}}\n\n===Discoveries at Elder Dempster===\n[[File:Red rubber frontpage.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Red Rubber'': \"The Story of the Rubber Slave Trade Flourishing on the Congo in the Year of Grace, 1906\"]]\nIn 1891, Morel obtained a clerkship with [[Elder Dempster]], a [[Liverpool]] shipping firm.<ref name=Dorward>Dorward, David.

Eds. Melvin Eugene Page and Penny M. Sonnenburg. ABC-CLIO, 2003. p. 392.</ref>  To increase his income and support his family, from 1893 Morel began writing articles against French [[protectionism]], which was damaging Elder Dempster's business. He came to be critical of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] for not supporting the rights of Africans under colonial rule. His vision of Africa was influenced by the books of [[Mary Kingsley]], an English traveller and writer, which showed sympathy for African peoples and a respect for different cultures that was very rare amongst [[White people|Europeans]] at the time.<ref>Hochschild, p. 188.</ref> Groups such as the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]] had already begun a campaign against alleged atrocities in Congo.<ref>Hochschild, p. 173.</ref>\n\nElder Dempster had a shipping contract with the [[Congo Free State]] for the connection between [[Antwerp]] and [[Boma, Kongo Central|Boma]]. Due to his knowledge of French, Morel was often sent to [[Belgium]], where he was able to view the internal accounts of the Congo Free State held by Elder Dempster. The knowledge that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried only guns, chains, ordnance and explosives, but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the colony came back full of valuable products such as raw rubber and [[ivory]], led him to the conclusion that Belgian [[King Leopold II]]'s policy was exploitative and a type of slavery.<ref>Hochschild, pp. 178-180.</ref> According to author [[Adam Hochschild]], Morel's conclusions were correct\u2014the value of the goods coming from the Congo Free State was five times that of the goods coming from Europe, and the difference was being extracted from the Congolese population through force and mass atrocities.<ref>Hochschild, p. 180.</ref>\n\nMorel discussed the discrepancies with the head of the Elder Dempster line, who responded coldly and dismissively. The company soon offered Morel an overseas promotion and then a [[sinecure]] consultancy in return for a guarantee of his silence. Morel refused both offers, and left the company in 1901 to become a full-time journalist.<ref>Hochschild, pp. 185-186.</ref>\n\n===Journalism and Congo Reform Association===\nIn 1900, Morel put new life into the campaign against Congo misrule (begun a decade before by the American [[George Washington Williams]]) with a series of articles detailing his discoveries about the Congo Free State trade imbalances.<ref name = Dorward /> His inside information made him a powerful voice against the exploitation, as previous activists had lacked his access to precise figures about the trade.<ref>Hochschild, p. 185.</ref> In 1903, he founded his own magazine, the ''West African Mail'', with the collaboration of [[John Holt (businessman)|John Holt]], a businessman and friend of [[Mary Kingsley]], who feared that the system of the Congo Free State would be applied upon the rest of the West African colonies. The ''Mail'' was an \"illustrated weekly journal founded to meet the rapidly growing interest in west and central African questions\".<ref>Hochschild 1998, p.&nbsp;186</ref> The paper also received initial financial backing from Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]], Morel's former employer at Elder Dempster, apparently in a final attempt to moderate Morel's criticism of the company, but Jones soon discontinued his support.<ref>Hochschild, p. 213.</ref> Morel published several pamphlets and his first book, ''Affairs of West Africa'', a collection of his essays.<ref>Olusanya, G.O.

Morel before WWI]]\n\n===Foreign policy===\nDuring the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911, Morel was entirely in sympathy with Germany and opposed to what he regarded as bellicosity by the United Kingdom and France, as well as secret diplomacy between the states involved.<ref>Rodriguez, J. (2011). Slavery in the Modern World: A History of Political, Social, and Economic Oppression. ABC-CLIO. p. 405.</ref> He wrote ''[[Morocco in Diplomacy (book)|Morocco in Diplomacy]]'' (1912) to express his views on the issue. At this time he was also selected by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] as a prospective House of Commons candidate for [[Birkenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Birkenhead]].\n\n===Pacifism and formation of Union of Democratic Control===\nAs the tension grew in the run-up to [[World War I]], Morel was again sympathetic to Germany, disinclined to stand by Belgium under German pressure, and opposed to the United Kingdom and France getting involved in war. He campaigned for neutrality but on the outbreak of war accepted that the fight was lost, and with [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]], [[Norman Angell]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]], formed the [[Union of Democratic Control]] to press for a more responsive foreign policy (he also resigned his candidature at this time). He was Secretary of the UDC until his death. The main demands of the UDC were: (1) that in future to prevent secret diplomacy there should be parliamentary control over foreign policy; (2) there should be negotiations after the war with other democratic European countries in an attempt to form an organisation to help prevent future conflicts; (3) that at the end of the war the terms of peace should neither humiliate the defeated nation nor artificially rearrange frontiers, as this might provide a cause for future wars.\n\nThe Union of Democratic Control became the most important of all the anti-war organisations in Britain, with membership reaching 650,000 by 1917. His political courage was praised by people such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and the writer [[Romain Rolland]], but his leading role in the pacifist movement exposed him to violent attacks led by the pro-war press. He was pictured as an agent of Germany in the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a newspaper that also listed details of future UDC meetings and encouraged its readers to attend and break them up. The accusation gained some credibility when Roger Casement, who was known as a friend and supporter of Morel, was hanged for [[treason]] (he had contacted the Germans seeking support for Irish nationalism). Morel was even the victim of occasional physical assaults.'''''\n\n===Imprisonment===\nOn 22 August 1917 Morel's house was searched and evidence was discovered that he had sent a UDC pamphlet to [[Romain Rolland]] in Switzerland, a neutral country; this was a breach of the [[Defence of the Realm Act]]. Morel was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, which he served in [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville Prison]]. Although, along with other pacifists, he was placed in the 'second division', allowing some privileges over the majority of prisoners, conditions were very hard, and Morel's health was seriously damaged. Bertrand Russell described his condition at his release:\n\n:His hair is completely white (there was hardly a tinge of white before) when he first came out, he collapsed completely, physically and mentally, largely as the result of insufficient food. He says one only gets three quarters of an hour reading in the whole day \u2013 the rest of the time is spent on prison work, etc.\n\nHe was released in January 1918.<ref name=\"IEWWI\">{{cite web|title=Morel, Edmund Dene|url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/morel_edmund_dene|website=International Encyclopedia of the First World War|publisher=International Encyclopedia of the First World War|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Independent Labour Party membership===\nIn April 1918, he joined the [[Independent Labour Party]], and began to feed his views into the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to which it was affiliated and which adopted his critical view of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Morel explained his decision to join the Independent Labour Party to a friend:\n \n:I have long been gravitating towards the Socialist position \u2014 of course there is Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, it seems to me that I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings \u2014 the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.\n\n==Post-war activism==\n\n===Treaty of Versailles===\nMorel was severely critical of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], warning that it would lead to another war. He particularly opposed the assignment of \"war guilt\" exclusively to the [[Central Powers]] and the mandate system for former German colonies. The latter theme became the focus of his 1920 book ''[[The Black Man's Burden]]''.<ref name = Dorward />\n\nHe did not give up his career as a journalist, becoming director of the magazine ''Foreign Affairs''.<ref name=Orzuff>Orzuff, Andrea.

In it, Morel wrote that France is \"thrusting her black savages into the heart of Germany\", saying that these \"primitive African savages, the carriers of syphilis, have become a horror and a terror\" to the Rhinelanders.<ref name=Reinders/> In his article, Morel claimed that the Senegalese soldiers serving in the French Army were \"primitive African barbarians\" who \"stuffed their haversacks with eye-balls, ears and heads of the foe\".<ref name=Campbell>Campbell, Peter. \"The 'Black Horror on the Rhine': Idealism, Pacifism, and Racism in Feminism and the Left in the Aftermath of the First World War.\" ''Social History'', Volume XLVII, Issue 94.

''The 'Black Horror on the Rhine': Intersections of Race, Nation, Gender and Class in 1920s Germany.'' London: Macmillan, 2017. p. 60.</ref>\n\nThe German sociologist Iris Wigger wrote that Morel's \"Black Horror on the Rhine\" campaign has caused much embarrassment to Morel's admirers today who would rather remember the man who campaigned against the Congo Free State, but in fact both campaigns were manifestations of the same racism as Morel believed that all black people were innately stupid and inferior to white people in all respects.<ref name=W5253 /> Through Morel had been very forceful in condemning the cruel exploitation of the Congo Free State, Morel believed in a liberal imperialism, just not the cruel exploitative imperialism of the Congo Company, writing it was the duty of whites to serve as the \"trustees\" for blacks and the \"great white father\" who would protect the \"basic human rights\" of Africans while at the same time accepting the \"infantile\" nature of black people who not the equal in any way of whites.<ref>Wigger, p. 54.</ref> Morel himself did not see his campaign as racist and he always presented himself as a friend to black people. In France, a French Socialist [[Charles Gide]] wrote about Morel's claims to be a protector of Africans that: \"''le genre de protection de M. Morel rappelle un peu le precepte que fait afficher la Society protectrice des animaux: 'Soyez bons pour les betes'''\" (Mr. Morel's kind of protection is a little reminiscent of the precepts of the Society for the Protection of Animals: 'Be good to the animals').<ref>Reinders, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIn particular, Morel believed that Africans, lacking the self-discipline of whites, had an uncontrolled sexuality, a subject which he had often written about.<ref name=W5253>Wigger, pp. 52-53.</ref> Morel believed that because of the high infant mortality in the tropics that Africans had evolved in such a way as to be obsessed with sex to the exclusion of everything else as they needed a high birth rate to maintain their numbers.<ref name=W5253/> Precisely because Morel believed in the uncontrolled sexuality of blacks, it was self-evident to him that the \"sexually uncontrolled and uncontrollable\" Senegalese would run amok in the Rhineland, raping every German female in sight.<ref>Wigger, p. 57.</ref> Two contemporaries challenged Morel on this: [[Claude McKay]], the Jamaican poet and labour activist, and [[Norman Leys]], the British Africanist. Leys stated that such allegations constituted \u201cone of the great sources of race hatred\u201d and \u201cshould never be repeated by any honest man or honest newspaper.\u201d<ref name=\"Donlon\">{{cite journal |last1=Donlon |first1=Anne |title=\"A Black Man Replies\": Claude McKay's Challenge to the British Left |journal=Lateral |date=May 2016 |volume=5 |issue=1 |doi=10.25158/L5.1.2 |url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:15618/datastreams/CONTENT/content |accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nMorel was very anti-French not only because of his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, but because of the nature of France's ''mission civilisatrice'' (\"civilizing mission\") in Africa (whereby any African who was willing to embrace the French language and culture would become French and theoretically the equal of whites) threatened to upend Morel's beliefs in the essential biological inferiority of blacks.<ref name=W5556>Wigger, pp. 55-56.</ref> Morel believed that the Africans were committing outrageous crimes against Germans in the Rhineland because the French had empowered them by least theoretically making them into black Frenchmen who were just as much citizens of the republic as anyone else.<ref name=W5556/>\n\n==Parliament==\nIn the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]], which followed the retirement of an incumbent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament, [[Alexander Wilkie]], Morel fought the two-member [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]] constituency as a sole Labour candidate. Although he gained fewer votes than [[Edwin Scrymgeour]] of the [[Scottish Prohibition Party]], he won the second seat, in the process defeating one of the outgoing Members \u2013 [[Winston Churchill]], standing as a National Liberal.

For many years, the conventional answer was yes ... but the truth is more somber. Some of the worst abuses in the Congo, such as the kidnapping of hostages, did stop as a result of the publicity. But the near-genocidal death rate in the territory continued for more than a decade under Belgian rule.<ref name=Africana>Hochschild, Adam.

The movement's other great achievement is that, among its supporters, it kept alive a tradition, a way of seeing the world, a human capacity for being outraged because pain is being inflicted on another human being, even when that pain is inflicted on someone of another color, in another country ...

He correctly deduced that these resources were being extracted from the population by force and began to campaign to expose the abuses. In collaboration with [[Roger Casement]], Morel led a campaign against slavery in the [[Congo Free State]], founding the [[Congo Reform Association]] and running the ''West African Mail''. With the help of celebrities such as [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[Mark Twain]], the movement successfully pressured the Belgian King [[Leopold II of Belgium|Leopold II]] to sell the Congo Free State to the Belgian government, ending some of the human rights abuses perpetrated under his rule.\n \t\t \t\nMorel played a significant role in the British [[pacifism|pacifist]] movement during the [[First World War]], participating in the foundation of and becoming secretary of the [[Union of Democratic Control]], at which point he broke with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]. In 1917, he was jailed for six months for his antiwar activism, which had a permanent effect on his health. After the war, he edited the journal ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', through which he sharply criticized what he considered French aggression and mistreatment of the defeated [[Central Powers]]. As part of his campaign against the French, he became the most important English proponent of the racist [[Black shame|Black Shame]] campaign, which accused black French troops of outrages against the population of the occupied [[Rhineland]].\n\nMorel was elected to Parliament in 1922 as a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] candidate, defeating the incumbent [[Winston Churchill]] for his seat, and was reelected in 1924, dying in office. Morel collaborated closely with future prime minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] and was considered for the post of [[Foreign Secretary]], though he ultimately acted only as an unofficial adviser to MacDonald's government.\n\n==Background==\nMorel was born in the [[Avenue d'Eylau]], Paris. His father, Edmond Pierre Marie Morel de Ville, was a French civil servant; his mother, Eliza Emmeline de Horne, was from an English [[Quaker]] family.  Edmond died when the boy was four, leaving no pension,<ref>Hochschild, Adam. ''King Leopold's Ghost''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin Company, 1998. p. 177.</ref> and Emmeline subsequently fell out with her late husband's family. As a consequence, Emmeline changed her name to Deville and raised her son on her own. To remove her son from the family's influence, she worked as a teacher so that she could send him to boarding school at both Madras House school in [[Eastbourne]] and later at [[Bedford Modern School]].\n\nWhen Emmeline Deville fell ill in 1888, the money for school fees was no longer available and Edmund was forced to return to Paris to work as a bank clerk.<ref>Hochschild, p. 177.</ref> He was able to move his mother back to Britain in 1891. Five years later he successfully applied for naturalisation as a British subject and [[Anglicisation|anglicised]] his name. He married Mary Richardson that same year; they had five children. His daughter Stella married the Polish political advisor [[Joseph Retinger]] in 1926; they had two daughters.\n\n==Congo activism==\n{{further|Atrocities in the Congo Free State}}\n\n===Discoveries at Elder Dempster===\n[[File:Red rubber frontpage.jpg|right|thumb|250px|''Red Rubber'': \"The Story of the Rubber Slave Trade Flourishing on the Congo in the Year of Grace, 1906\"]]\nIn 1891, Morel obtained a clerkship with [[Elder Dempster]], a [[Liverpool]] shipping firm.<ref name=Dorward>Dorward, David.

Eds. Melvin Eugene Page and Penny M. Sonnenburg. ABC-CLIO, 2003. p. 392.</ref>  To increase his income and support his family, from 1893 Morel began writing articles against French [[protectionism]], which was damaging Elder Dempster's business. He came to be critical of the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] for not supporting the rights of Africans under colonial rule. His vision of Africa was influenced by the books of [[Mary Kingsley]], an English traveller and writer, which showed sympathy for African peoples and a respect for different cultures that was very rare amongst [[White people|Europeans]] at the time.<ref>Hochschild, p. 188.</ref> Groups such as the [[Aborigines' Protection Society]] had already begun a campaign against alleged atrocities in Congo.<ref>Hochschild, p. 173.</ref>\n\nElder Dempster had a shipping contract with the [[Congo Free State]] for the connection between [[Antwerp]] and [[Boma, Kongo Central|Boma]]. Due to his knowledge of French, Morel was often sent to [[Belgium]], where he was able to view the internal accounts of the Congo Free State held by Elder Dempster. The knowledge that the ships leaving Belgium for the Congo carried only guns, chains, ordnance and explosives, but no commercial goods, while ships arriving from the colony came back full of valuable products such as raw rubber and [[ivory]], led him to the conclusion that Belgian [[King Leopold II]]'s policy was exploitative and a type of slavery.<ref>Hochschild, pp. 178-180.</ref> According to author [[Adam Hochschild]], Morel's conclusions were correct\u2014the value of the goods coming from the Congo Free State was five times that of the goods coming from Europe, and the difference was being extracted from the Congolese population through force and mass atrocities.<ref>Hochschild, p. 180.</ref>\n\nMorel discussed the discrepancies with the head of the Elder Dempster line, who responded coldly and dismissively. The company soon offered Morel an overseas promotion and then a [[sinecure]] consultancy in return for a guarantee of his silence. Morel refused both offers, and left the company in 1901 to become a full-time journalist.<ref>Hochschild, pp. 185-186.</ref>\n\n===Journalism and Congo Reform Association===\nIn 1900, Morel put new life into the campaign against Congo misrule (begun a decade before by the American [[George Washington Williams]]) with a series of articles detailing his discoveries about the Congo Free State trade imbalances.<ref name = Dorward /> His inside information made him a powerful voice against the exploitation, as previous activists had lacked his access to precise figures about the trade.<ref>Hochschild, p. 185.</ref> In 1903, he founded his own magazine, the ''West African Mail'', with the collaboration of [[John Holt (businessman)|John Holt]], a businessman and friend of [[Mary Kingsley]], who feared that the system of the Congo Free State would be applied upon the rest of the West African colonies. The ''Mail'' was an \"illustrated weekly journal founded to meet the rapidly growing interest in west and central African questions\".<ref>Hochschild 1998, p.&nbsp;186</ref> The paper also received initial financial backing from Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]], Morel's former employer at Elder Dempster, apparently in a final attempt to moderate Morel's criticism of the company, but Jones soon discontinued his support.<ref>Hochschild, p. 213.</ref> Morel published several pamphlets and his first book, ''Affairs of West Africa'', a collection of his essays.<ref>Olusanya, G.O.

Even the [[Church of England]] and American religious groups backed him.\n\nIn 1905 the movement won a victory when a Commission of Enquiry, instituted (under external pressure) by King L\u00e9opold II himself, substantially confirmed the accusations made about the colonial administration.<ref>Hochschild, p. 251.</ref> In the face of mounting public and diplomatic pressure, in 1908 the Congo was annexed to the Belgian government and put under its sovereignty.<ref>Hochschild, pp. 257-259.</ref> Despite this, Morel refused to declare an end to the campaign until 1913 because he wanted to see actual changes in the situation of the country. The Congo Reform Association ended operations in 1913.<ref>Hochschild, pp. 271-273.</ref>\n\n==World War I activism==\n[[File:E.D. Morel.jpg|thumb|E.D. Morel before WWI]]\n\n===Foreign policy===\nDuring the [[Agadir Crisis]] of 1911, Morel was entirely in sympathy with Germany and opposed to what he regarded as bellicosity by the United Kingdom and France, as well as secret diplomacy between the states involved.<ref>Rodriguez, J. (2011). Slavery in the Modern World: A History of Political, Social, and Economic Oppression. ABC-CLIO. p. 405.</ref> He wrote ''[[Morocco in Diplomacy (book)|Morocco in Diplomacy]]'' (1912) to express his views on the issue. At this time he was also selected by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] as a prospective House of Commons candidate for [[Birkenhead (UK Parliament constituency)|Birkenhead]].\n\n===Pacifism and formation of Union of Democratic Control===\nAs the tension grew in the run-up to [[World War I]], Morel was again sympathetic to Germany, disinclined to stand by Belgium under German pressure, and opposed to the United Kingdom and France getting involved in war. He campaigned for neutrality but on the outbreak of war accepted that the fight was lost, and with [[Sir Charles Trevelyan, 3rd Baronet|Charles Trevelyan]], [[Norman Angell]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]], formed the [[Union of Democratic Control]] to press for a more responsive foreign policy (he also resigned his candidature at this time). He was Secretary of the UDC until his death. The main demands of the UDC were: (1) that in future to prevent secret diplomacy there should be parliamentary control over foreign policy; (2) there should be negotiations after the war with other democratic European countries in an attempt to form an organisation to help prevent future conflicts; (3) that at the end of the war the terms of peace should neither humiliate the defeated nation nor artificially rearrange frontiers, as this might provide a cause for future wars.\n\nThe Union of Democratic Control became the most important of all the anti-war organisations in Britain, with membership reaching 650,000 by 1917. His political courage was praised by people such as [[Bertrand Russell]] and the writer [[Romain Rolland]], but his leading role in the pacifist movement exposed him to violent attacks led by the pro-war press. He was pictured as an agent of Germany in the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a newspaper that also listed details of future UDC meetings and encouraged its readers to attend and break them up. The accusation gained some credibility when Roger Casement, who was known as a friend and supporter of Morel, was hanged for [[treason]] (he had contacted the Germans seeking support for Irish nationalism). Morel was even the victim of occasional physical assaults.'''''\n\n===Imprisonment===\nOn 22 August 1917 Morel's house was searched and evidence was discovered that he had sent a UDC pamphlet to [[Romain Rolland]] in Switzerland, a neutral country; this was a breach of the [[Defence of the Realm Act]]. Morel was sentenced to six months' imprisonment, which he served in [[Pentonville (HM Prison)|Pentonville Prison]]. Although, along with other pacifists, he was placed in the 'second division', allowing some privileges over the majority of prisoners, conditions were very hard, and Morel's health was seriously damaged. Bertrand Russell described his condition at his release:\n\n:His hair is completely white (there was hardly a tinge of white before) when he first came out, he collapsed completely, physically and mentally, largely as the result of insufficient food. He says one only gets three quarters of an hour reading in the whole day \u2013 the rest of the time is spent on prison work, etc.\n\nHe was released in January 1918.<ref name=\"IEWWI\">{{cite web|title=Morel, Edmund Dene|url=https://encyclopedia.1914-1918-online.net/article/morel_edmund_dene|website=International Encyclopedia of the First World War|publisher=International Encyclopedia of the First World War|accessdate=15 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Independent Labour Party membership===\nIn April 1918, he joined the [[Independent Labour Party]], and began to feed his views into the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] to which it was affiliated and which adopted his critical view of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Morel explained his decision to join the Independent Labour Party to a friend:\n \n:I have long been gravitating towards the Socialist position \u2014 of course there is Socialism and Socialism, and mine is of the reasonable and moderate kind. When I look over my public efforts through the years, it seems to me that I have been a Socialist all my life. So far as any Party can express what appears to me to be the country's needs, the ILP approximates nearer to my outlook that any other, although I still look forward to and hope for the day when all really progressive forces can unite under the title of the Democratic Party. But Liberalism as represented by both wings \u2014 the Lloyd George wing, and the Asquith wing, is right outside my outlook now.\n\n==Post-war activism==\n\n===Treaty of Versailles===\nMorel was severely critical of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], warning that it would lead to another war. He particularly opposed the assignment of \"war guilt\" exclusively to the [[Central Powers]] and the mandate system for former German colonies. The latter theme became the focus of his 1920 book ''[[The Black Man's Burden]]''.<ref name = Dorward />\n\nHe did not give up his career as a journalist, becoming director of the magazine ''Foreign Affairs''.<ref name=Orzuff>Orzuff, Andrea.

In France, a French Socialist [[Charles Gide]] wrote about Morel's claims to be a protector of Africans that: \"''le genre de protection de M. Morel rappelle un peu le precepte que fait afficher la Society protectrice des animaux: 'Soyez bons pour les betes'''\" (Mr. Morel's kind of protection is a little reminiscent of the precepts of the Society for the Protection of Animals: 'Be good to the animals').<ref>Reinders, p. 19.</ref>\n\nIn particular, Morel believed that Africans, lacking the self-discipline of whites, had an uncontrolled sexuality, a subject which he had often written about.<ref name=W5253>Wigger, pp. 52-53.</ref> Morel believed that because of the high infant mortality in the tropics that Africans had evolved in such a way as to be obsessed with sex to the exclusion of everything else as they needed a high birth rate to maintain their numbers.<ref name=W5253/> Precisely because Morel believed in the uncontrolled sexuality of blacks, it was self-evident to him that the \"sexually uncontrolled and uncontrollable\" Senegalese would run amok in the Rhineland, raping every German female in sight.<ref>Wigger, p. 57.</ref> Two contemporaries challenged Morel on this: [[Claude McKay]], the Jamaican poet and labour activist, and [[Norman Leys]], the British Africanist. Leys stated that such allegations constituted \u201cone of the great sources of race hatred\u201d and \u201cshould never be repeated by any honest man or honest newspaper.\u201d<ref name=\"Donlon\">{{cite journal |last1=Donlon |first1=Anne |title=\"A Black Man Replies\": Claude McKay's Challenge to the British Left |journal=Lateral |date=May 2016 |volume=5 |issue=1 |doi=10.25158/L5.1.2 |url=https://hcommons.org/deposits/objects/hc:15618/datastreams/CONTENT/content |accessdate=25 August 2018}}</ref>\n\nMorel was very anti-French not only because of his opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, but because of the nature of France's ''mission civilisatrice'' (\"civilizing mission\") in Africa (whereby any African who was willing to embrace the French language and culture would become French and theoretically the equal of whites) threatened to upend Morel's beliefs in the essential biological inferiority of blacks.<ref name=W5556>Wigger, pp. 55-56.</ref> Morel believed that the Africans were committing outrageous crimes against Germans in the Rhineland because the French had empowered them by least theoretically making them into black Frenchmen who were just as much citizens of the republic as anyone else.<ref name=W5556/>\n\n==Parliament==\nIn the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 general election]], which followed the retirement of an incumbent [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament, [[Alexander Wilkie]], Morel fought the two-member [[Dundee (UK Parliament constituency)|Dundee]] constituency as a sole Labour candidate. Although he gained fewer votes than [[Edwin Scrymgeour]] of the [[Scottish Prohibition Party]], he won the second seat, in the process defeating one of the outgoing Members \u2013 [[Winston Churchill]], standing as a National Liberal.

For many years, the conventional answer was yes ... but the truth is more somber. Some of the worst abuses in the Congo, such as the kidnapping of hostages, did stop as a result of the publicity. But the near-genocidal death rate in the territory continued for more than a decade under Belgian rule.<ref name=Africana>Hochschild, Adam.

The movement's other great achievement is that, among its supporters, it kept alive a tradition, a way of seeing the world, a human capacity for being outraged because pain is being inflicted on another human being, even when that pain is inflicted on someone of another color, in another country ... It is this spirit that underlies organisations like Amnesty International ... and M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res.<ref name=Africana /></blockquote>\n\n==Books published==\n* ''Affairs of West Africa'' (1902)\n* ''The British Case in French Congo''\n* ''King Leopold's Rule in Africa'' (1904)\n* ''Red Rubber \u2013 The story of the rubber slave trade that flourished in Congo in the year of grace 1906'' (1906)\n* ''Great Britain and the Congo''\n* ''Nigeria ''\n* ''Morocco and Diplomacy'' (1912) (reissued as ''Ten Years of Secret Diplomacy'' in 1915)\n* ''Truth and the War'' (1916)\n* ''Africa and the Peace of Europe ''\n* ''[[m:wikisource:The Black Man's Burden|The Black Man's Burden]]'' (1920)\n* ''Thoughts on the War''\n* ''The Peace, and Prison ''\n* ''Pre-War Diplomacy''\n* ''Diplomacy Revealed''\n* ''The Horror on the Rhine'' (1921)\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Alexander, Nathan G.
