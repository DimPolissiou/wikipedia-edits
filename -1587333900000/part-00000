He was succeeded by his top assistant, [[Wimp Sanderson]].  He had been at Alabama since 1960 as a graduate assistant to Newton's predecessor, [[Hayden Riley]]; he was named a full-fledged assistant in 1961.  In 12 years as head coach his teams averaged 21.8 wins a year, with a 267\u2013119 record, and they won 4 SEC tournaments. They played in one NIT and eight NCAA tournaments making the \"Sweet 16\" five times. Sanderson is the only coach in Alabama history to win 200 or more games in his first 10 years. He was the SEC Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and was the National Coach of the Year in 1987.<ref name=\"ashof\" >{{cite web |title=''Wimp Sanderson'' |work=Alabama Sports Hall of Fame |url=http://www.ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&view=company&srctype=display&back=company&id=230&category=Basketball&submenu=Inductees&pos=0,15,14&PHPSESSID=4558f07a5692c8f5eb8069936dd5870d |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>\n\nSanderson was best known for wearing garish [[Tartan|plaid]] [[sports jacket]]s on the sidelines.  At one point, [[Coleman Coliseum]] was known as the \"Plaid Palace\", and the mid-court logo was painted in a crimson-and-white plaid pattern.\n\n===David Hobbs===\nHobbs was hired at Alabama as an assistant coach for Wimp Sanderson in 1985 and spent seven years as an assistant in Tuscaloosa helping the Crimson Tide win one SEC Championship and four SEC Tournament crowns while the Tide made four appearances in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. As an assistant, he had the opportunity to coach such All-SEC performers as [[Robert Horry]], [[James Robinson (basketball)|James \"Hollywood\" Robinson]] and [[Latrell Sprewell]].\n\nWhen Sanderson left Alabama following the 1992 season, Hobbs was named head coach. In his first season, the Tide finished 16\u201313 and advanced to the NIT. In 1994 and 1995, Alabama recorded 20-win seasons and advanced to the NCAA Tournament behind the play of future NBA All-Star [[Antonio McDyess]]. In 1996, Hobbs led UA to a 19\u201313 mark and a berth in the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] Final Four. He resigned his post following the 1998 season after compiling a 110\u201376 (.594) career record and producing nine All-SEC players.\n\n===Mark Gottfried===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; font-size:85%; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; background:#9e1b32; color:white;\"| '''Mark Gottfried (1998\u20132009)'''\n|-\n!

He was hired by Alabama in March 1998 after coaching at [[Murray State]] for three seasons.\n\nThe Crimson Tide achieved the highest pinnacle ever for the school in both the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Championship Tournament]] and the [[AP Poll|Associated Press Poll]] reaching the Elite Eight in the tournament in 2004 and reaching the No. 1 spot in the nation in the AP poll in 2002, both under Mark Gottfried's command.\n\nGottfried led the Tide to its only SEC Championship under his watch during the 2001\u201302 season, although the team never won a conference tournament championship during his tenure. For his efforts in 2002, Gottfried was named SEC Coach of the Year by both the Associated Press and his fellow Southeastern Conference coaches. Perhaps his biggest accomplishment as coach at Alabama was leading the Crimson Tide to five consecutive NCAA tournaments from 2002\u20132006, another first for the school that occurred under his watch.\n\nGottfried resigned on January 26, 2009 with 11 regular season games still remaining on the team's schedule.

The program was notable as a regular conference basketball contender in the 1980s and early 1990s under the direction of coach [[Wimp Sanderson]] and in the 1970s under coach [[C. M. Newton]]. Alabama has eight NCAA Tournament Sweet 16 appearances.

He was succeeded by his top assistant, [[Wimp Sanderson]].  He had been at Alabama since 1960 as a graduate assistant to Newton's predecessor, [[Hayden Riley]]; he was named a full-fledged assistant in 1961.  In 12 years as head coach his teams averaged 21.8 wins a year, with a 267\u2013119 record, and they won 4 SEC tournaments. They played in one NIT and eight NCAA tournaments making the \"Sweet 16\" five times. Sanderson is the only coach in Alabama history to win 200 or more games in his first 10 years. He was the SEC Coach of the Year in 1987, 1989 and 1990, and was the National Coach of the Year in 1987.<ref name=\"ashof\" >{{cite web |title=''Wimp Sanderson'' |work=Alabama Sports Hall of Fame |url=http://www.ashof.org/index.php?src=directory&view=company&srctype=display&back=company&id=230&category=Basketball&submenu=Inductees&pos=0,15,14&PHPSESSID=4558f07a5692c8f5eb8069936dd5870d |accessdate=2007-02-25}}</ref>\n\nSanderson was best known for wearing garish [[Tartan|plaid]] [[sports jacket]]s on the sidelines.  At one point, [[Coleman Coliseum]] was known as the \"Plaid Palace\", and the mid-court logo was painted in a crimson-and-white plaid pattern.\n\n===David Hobbs===\nHobbs was hired at Alabama as an assistant coach for Wimp Sanderson in 1985 and spent seven years as an assistant in Tuscaloosa helping the Crimson Tide win one SEC Championship and four SEC Tournament crowns while the Tide made four appearances in the NCAA Tournament's Sweet 16. As an assistant, he had the opportunity to coach such All-SEC performers as [[Robert Horry]], [[James Robinson (basketball)|James \"Hollywood\" Robinson]] and [[Latrell Sprewell]].\n\nWhen Sanderson left Alabama following the 1992 season, Hobbs was named head coach. In his first season, the Tide finished 16\u201313 and advanced to the NIT. In 1994 and 1995, Alabama recorded 20-win seasons and advanced to the NCAA Tournament behind the play of future NBA All-Star [[Antonio McDyess]]. In 1996, Hobbs led UA to a 19\u201313 mark and a berth in the [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] Final Four. He resigned his post following the 1998 season after compiling a 110\u201376 (.594) career record and producing nine All-SEC players.\n\n===Mark Gottfried===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"  style=\"float:right; font-size:85%; clear:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"4\"  style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%; background:#9e1b32; color:white;\"| '''Mark Gottfried (1998\u20132009)'''\n|-\n!

He was hired by Alabama in March 1998 after coaching at [[Murray State]] for three seasons.\n\nThe Crimson Tide achieved the highest pinnacle ever for the school in both the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Championship Tournament]] and the [[AP Poll|Associated Press Poll]] reaching the Elite Eight in the tournament in 2004 and reaching the No. 1 spot in the nation in the AP poll in 2002, both under Mark Gottfried's command.\n\nGottfried led the Tide to its only SEC Championship under his watch during the 2001\u201302 season, although the team never won a conference tournament championship during his tenure. For his efforts in 2002, Gottfried was named SEC Coach of the Year by both the Associated Press and his fellow Southeastern Conference coaches. Perhaps his biggest accomplishment as coach at Alabama was leading the Crimson Tide to five consecutive NCAA tournaments from 2002\u20132006, another first for the school that occurred under his watch.\n\nGottfried resigned on January 26, 2009 with 11 regular season games still remaining on the team's schedule.

During the run, more than three hundred programmes, featuring original [[television play]]s, and adaptations of stage plays and novels, were transmitted. The individual episodes were between fifty and a hundred minutes in duration. A handful of these plays, including ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', subsequently became television series in their own right.\n\n==History==\nThe strand was a successor to ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'', the 1960s anthology series, the title being changed when the day of transmission became variable. Some works screened in anthology series' on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], like [[Willy Russell]]'s ''[[Our Day Out]]'' (1977), were repeated on BBC1 in the series. The producers of ''The Wednesday Play'', [[Graeme MacDonald]] and [[Irene Shubik]], transferred to the new series. Shubik continued with the series until 1973<ref>Irene Shubik [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/05/theatre \"Letters: Eclectic roster on Play for Today\",] ''The Guardian'', 5 April 2008</ref> while MacDonald remained with the series until 1977 when he was promoted. Later producers included Margaret Matheson and [[Richard Eyre]] (1978\u201380).\n\nPlays covered all genres. In its time, ''Play for Today'' featured contemporary [[social realism|social realist dramas]], historical pieces, fantasies, biopics and occasionally science-fiction<ref>Richard Hewett [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/714453/index.html ''Flipside of Dominick Hide, The (1980)''], BFI screenonline</ref> (''[[The Flipside of Dominick Hide]]'', 1980). Most pieces were written directly for television, but there were also occasional adaptations from other narrative forms, such as novels and stage plays.\n\nWriters who contributed plays to the series included [[Ian McEwan]], [[John Osborne]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Stephen Poliakoff]], [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], [[Willy Russell]], [[Alan Bleasdale]], [[Arthur Hopcraft]], [[Alan Plater]], [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]], [[David Storey]], [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], [[Rhys Adrian]] and [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. Several prominent directors also featured, including [[Stephen Frears]], [[Alan Clarke]], [[Michael Apted]], [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], [[Roland Joffe]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Mike Leigh]]. Some of the best remembered plays broadcast in the strand include ''[[Edna, the Inebriate Woman]]'' (1971), ''[[The Foxtrot]]'' (1971), ''[[Home (play)|Home]]'' (1972), ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' (1976), ''[[Abigail's Party]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Remembered Hills]]'' (1979) and ''[[Just a Boys' Game]]'' (1979). Certain other well known plays, including ''[[Penda's Fen]]'' (1974), ''[[Nuts in May]]'' (1976), were commissioned by [[David Rose (producer)|David Rose]] of the BBC's English Regions Drama department based in [[Pebble Mill Studios|Birmingham]].\n\nSome installments in the series were spun off into full-blown series. Probably the two best-remembered examples of this are ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey#Origins: Play for Today|Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', which was produced as a one-off in the ''Play for Today'' strand in 1975 and three years later became a series for [[Thames Television]], again with [[Leo McKern]]. [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''The Black Stuff'', was a single play broadcast on BBC2 in January 1980, which was developed into ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. It was never part of the ''Play For Today'' strand, although it was repeated on BBC1 later that year as a single play.<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6dd53e1faa6844c1a56cd4c5e049db68</ref><ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c95d68d870274ab1941362fb1649c953</ref> Other offshoots were ''[[Gangsters (TV series)|Gangsters]]'', and a single series of science fiction-based plays styled as ''[[Play for Tomorrow]]''. Towards the end of the run, three plays set in Northern Ireland were written by [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]]. Known as the Billy Plays, they starred [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Billy Martin in his first acting role following his graduation from [[RADA]].\n\nThere were also some groups of plays transmitted that \u2014 for various reasons \u2014 did not go out under the ''Play for Today'' banner, but which were funded from the same department, used much the same production team and are generally regarded in episode guides and analysis as being part of the ''Play for Today'' 'canon'.\n\nSeveral plays were BAFTA award winners. [[John Le Mesurier]] and [[Patricia Hayes]] were named Best Actor & Actress respectively for their roles in the 1971 series ''Traitor'' and ''Edna, The Inebriate Woman'', the latter also being named Best Drama Production. [[Celia Johnson]] was named Best Actress for ''Mrs. Palfrey At The Claremont'', broadcast in 1973. ''Stocker's Copper (1972)'', ''Kisses At Fifty (1973)'', ''Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976)'', ''Spend, Spend, Spend! (1977)'', ''Licking Hitler (1978)'' and ''Blue Remembered Hills (1979)'' were all named Best Single Play by BAFTA.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nTwo plays were controversially pulled from transmission shortly before broadcast due to concerns over their content: these were Dennis Potter's ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]'' in 1976 and Roy Minton's ''[[Scum (television play)|Scum]]'' the following year. In the case of ''Brimstone and Treacle'' it was due to concerns over the play's depiction of a disabled woman's rape at the hands of a man who may or may not be the [[devil]], and with ''Scum'' the worry was its supposed sensationalism of life in a young offenders' institution (then still known as a [[borstal]]). ''Scum'' and ''Brimstone and Treacle'' were eventually transmitted, although in the meantime both had circumvented their withdrawal by being re-made as cinema films.\n\nThe series as a whole was viewed with suspicion by rightwing commentators and critics as many of the issues tackled were the subject of political controversy. Of particular note was the criticism of the public expenditure on the Queen's Silver Jubilee in the plays ''[[The Price of Coal]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Spongers]]'' (1978).\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n\nAfter fourteen seasons and numerous repeats of individual productions, the programme officially ended in 1984, although there was one further series not broadcast in its original name but in its replacement name ''[[Screen One]]'' and ''[[Screen Two]]'' in 1985. The general trend in 1980s television production was away from one-off plays and towards a greater concentration on series and serials. When one-offs were produced, such as [[Film4 Productions|Film on Four]] on [[Channel 4]], they tended to be made with a cinematic approach rather than betraying television drama's roots in the theatre that ''Play for Today'' and earlier series on both the BBC and  ITV had often demonstrated.\n\nNonetheless, the series is generally remembered as a benchmark of high-quality British television drama, and has become a byword for what many continue to argue was a golden age of British television. In 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] produced a poll of industry professionals to determine the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, and five of the programmes included in the final tally were from ''Play for Today''.\n\nA new programme publicised as a return of ''Play for Today'', but under the working title of ''The Evening Play'', was announced at the beginning of March 2006,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Gibson\n  | first =Owen\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = BBC to revive the drama slot that helped Loach and Leigh to fame\n  | work =[[The Guardian]]\n  | date =1 March 2006\n  | url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1720525,00.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =31 March 2008}}</ref> but nothing has been heard from it since.

During the run, more than three hundred programmes, featuring original [[television play]]s, and adaptations of stage plays and novels, were transmitted. The individual episodes were between fifty and a hundred minutes in duration. A handful of these plays, including ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', subsequently became television series in their own right.\n\n==History==\nThe strand was a successor to ''[[The Wednesday Play]]'', the 1960s anthology series, the title being changed when the day of transmission became variable. Some works screened in anthology series' on [[BBC Two|BBC2]], like [[Willy Russell]]'s ''[[Our Day Out]]'' (1977), were repeated on BBC1 in the series. The producers of ''The Wednesday Play'', [[Graeme MacDonald]] and [[Irene Shubik]], transferred to the new series. Shubik continued with the series until 1973<ref>Irene Shubik [https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2008/apr/05/theatre \"Letters: Eclectic roster on Play for Today\",] ''The Guardian'', 5 April 2008</ref> while MacDonald remained with the series until 1977 when he was promoted. Later producers included Margaret Matheson and [[Richard Eyre]] (1978\u201380).\n\nPlays covered all genres. In its time, ''Play for Today'' featured contemporary [[social realism|social realist dramas]], historical pieces, fantasies, biopics and occasionally science-fiction<ref>Richard Hewett [http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/714453/index.html ''Flipside of Dominick Hide, The (1980)''], BFI screenonline</ref> (''[[The Flipside of Dominick Hide]]'', 1980). Most pieces were written directly for television, but there were also occasional adaptations from other narrative forms, such as novels and stage plays.\n\nWriters who contributed plays to the series included [[Ian McEwan]], [[John Osborne]], [[Dennis Potter]], [[Stephen Poliakoff]], [[David Hare (dramatist)|David Hare]], [[Willy Russell]], [[Alan Bleasdale]], [[Arthur Hopcraft]], [[Alan Plater]], [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]], [[David Storey]], [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]], [[Rhys Adrian]] and [[John Hopkins (writer)|John Hopkins]]. Several prominent directors also featured, including [[Stephen Frears]], [[Alan Clarke]], [[Michael Apted]], [[Mike Newell (director)|Mike Newell]], [[Roland Joffe]], [[Ken Loach]], [[Lindsay Anderson]], and [[Mike Leigh]]. Some of the best remembered plays broadcast in the strand include ''[[Edna, the Inebriate Woman]]'' (1971), ''[[The Foxtrot]]'' (1971), ''[[Home (play)|Home]]'' (1972), ''[[Bar Mitzvah Boy]]'' (1976), ''[[Abigail's Party]]'' (1977), ''[[Blue Remembered Hills]]'' (1979) and ''[[Just a Boys' Game]]'' (1979). Certain other well known plays, including ''[[Penda's Fen]]'' (1974), ''[[Nuts in May]]'' (1976), were commissioned by [[David Rose (producer)|David Rose]] of the BBC's English Regions Drama department based in [[Pebble Mill Studios|Birmingham]].\n\nSome installments in the series were spun off into full-blown series. Probably the two best-remembered examples of this are ''[[Rumpole of the Bailey#Origins: Play for Today|Rumpole of the Bailey]]'', which was produced as a one-off in the ''Play for Today'' strand in 1975 and three years later became a series for [[Thames Television]], again with [[Leo McKern]]. [[Alan Bleasdale]]'s ''The Black Stuff'', was a single play broadcast on BBC2 in January 1980, which was developed into ''[[Boys from the Blackstuff]]''. It was never part of the ''Play For Today'' strand, although it was repeated on BBC1 later that year as a single play.<ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/6dd53e1faa6844c1a56cd4c5e049db68</ref><ref>https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/c95d68d870274ab1941362fb1649c953</ref> Other offshoots were ''[[Gangsters (TV series)|Gangsters]]'', and a single series of science fiction-based plays styled as ''[[Play for Tomorrow]]''. Towards the end of the run, three plays set in Northern Ireland were written by [[Graham Reid (writer)|Graham Reid]]. Known as the Billy Plays, they starred [[Kenneth Branagh]] as Billy Martin in his first acting role following his graduation from [[RADA]].\n\nThere were also some groups of plays transmitted that \u2014 for various reasons \u2014 did not go out under the ''Play for Today'' banner, but which were funded from the same department, used much the same production team and are generally regarded in episode guides and analysis as being part of the ''Play for Today'' 'canon'.\n\nSeveral plays were BAFTA award winners. [[John Le Mesurier]] and [[Patricia Hayes]] were named Best Actor & Actress respectively for their roles in the 1971 series ''Traitor'' and ''Edna, The Inebriate Woman'', the latter also being named Best Drama Production. [[Celia Johnson]] was named Best Actress for ''Mrs. Palfrey At The Claremont'', broadcast in 1973. ''Stocker's Copper (1972)'', ''Kisses At Fifty (1973)'', ''Bar Mitzvah Boy (1976)'', ''Spend, Spend, Spend! (1977)'', ''Licking Hitler (1978)'' and ''Blue Remembered Hills (1979)'' were all named Best Single Play by BAFTA.\n\n==Controversies==\n\nTwo plays were controversially pulled from transmission shortly before broadcast due to concerns over their content: these were Dennis Potter's ''[[Brimstone and Treacle]]'' in 1976 and Roy Minton's ''[[Scum (television play)|Scum]]'' the following year. In the case of ''Brimstone and Treacle'' it was due to concerns over the play's depiction of a disabled woman's rape at the hands of a man who may or may not be the [[devil]], and with ''Scum'' the worry was its supposed sensationalism of life in a young offenders' institution (then still known as a [[borstal]]). ''Scum'' and ''Brimstone and Treacle'' were eventually transmitted, although in the meantime both had circumvented their withdrawal by being re-made as cinema films.\n\nThe series as a whole was viewed with suspicion by rightwing commentators and critics as many of the issues tackled were the subject of political controversy. Of particular note was the criticism of the public expenditure on the Queen's Silver Jubilee in the plays ''[[The Price of Coal]]'' (1977) and ''[[The Spongers]]'' (1978).\n\n==Demise and legacy==\n\nAfter fourteen seasons and numerous repeats of individual productions, the programme officially ended in 1984, although there was one further series not broadcast in its original name but in its replacement name ''[[Screen One]]'' and ''[[Screen Two]]'' in 1985. The general trend in 1980s television production was away from one-off plays and towards a greater concentration on series and serials. When one-offs were produced, such as [[Film4 Productions|Film on Four]] on [[Channel 4]], they tended to be made with a cinematic approach rather than betraying television drama's roots in the theatre that ''Play for Today'' and earlier series on both the BBC and  ITV had often demonstrated.\n\nNonetheless, the series is generally remembered as a benchmark of high-quality British television drama, and has become a byword for what many continue to argue was a golden age of British television. In 2000, the [[British Film Institute]] produced a poll of industry professionals to determine the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] of the 20th century, and five of the programmes included in the final tally were from ''Play for Today''.\n\nA new programme publicised as a return of ''Play for Today'', but under the working title of ''The Evening Play'', was announced at the beginning of March 2006,<ref>{{cite news\n  | last =Gibson\n  | first =Owen\n  | authorlink =\n  | coauthors =\n  | title = BBC to revive the drama slot that helped Loach and Leigh to fame\n  | work =[[The Guardian]]\n  | date =1 March 2006\n  | url= http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/story/0,,1720525,00.html\n  | doi =\n  | accessdate =31 March 2008}}</ref> but nothing has been heard from it since.

The election was the last general election to use the [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system, with all members elected from single-member [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]].\n\nThe election saw the governing [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], led by [[Jim Bolger]], win a second term in office, despite a major swing away from National in both seats and votes. The opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], despite a slight drop in their support, managed to make gains in terms of seats. The new [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]] and [[New Zealand First]] parties gained significant shares of the vote, but won few seats. \n\n==Background==\nBefore the election, the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] governed with 64 seats, while the opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] held only 29. The [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 election]] had been a major victory for the National Party, with the unpopular Fourth Labour Government being decisively defeated. The Labour Party had become unpopular for its ongoing economic reforms, which were based around [[liberalisation]], [[privatisation]], and the removal of [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]]. The National Party was somewhat divided as to the merits of the reforms, with conservatives generally opposed and neoliberals generally in favour. The party had fought the 1990 election saying that the Labour government's program was too radical, and was being carried out without any thought of the social consequences \u2013 [[Jim Bolger]] spoke about \"the Decent Society\", promising a return to a more moderate and balanced platform. Once in government, however, the key [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] role was taken not by a moderate but by [[Ruth Richardson]], who wished to expand, not end, the economic reforms. Many of the voters who had felt betrayed by Labour's reforms now felt betrayed by the National Party as well, a fact which contributed to the rise of minor parties.\n\nThe [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]], the largest \"third party\", was a broad coalition of five smaller groups \u2013 the [[NewLabour Party (New Zealand)|NewLabour Party]] (a Labour splinter), the [[Democratic Party of New Zealand|Democrats]] (a [[social credit]] party), the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]] (an [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] party), [[Mana Motuhake (political party)|Mana Motuhake]] (a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] party), and the [[New Zealand Liberal Party (1992)|Liberal Party]] (a National splinter). The Alliance held three seats in Parliament \u2013 one belonged to [[Jim Anderton]], who had been re-elected under a NewLabour banner in the seat he had formerly held for Labour, while the other two belonged to the National MPs who formed the Liberal Party. In its first electoral test, the [[1992 Tamaki by-election|1992 by-election in Tamaki]], the Alliance had performed well, taking second place. Another smaller group was [[New Zealand First]], a party established by former National MP [[Winston Peters]]. Peters had broken with his party after a number of policy disputes with its leadership, and resigned from parliament to contest his seat as an independent. After being overwhelmingly re-elected, Peters established New Zealand First to promote his views. Peters was the party's sole MP.\n\nAnother consequence of dissatisfaction with both major parties was the referendum conducted alongside the 1993 election. The culmination of the larger decade-long [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|New Zealand electoral reform]] process, the referendum was held following the September 1992 indicative referendum, which saw 85% of voters voting for change from the existing First Past The Post (FPP) system, and 70% choosing the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) as its preferred replacement: a [[proportional representation|proportional]] system which would make it easier for smaller parties to win seats. It asked voters to choose whether to keep the existing FPP system or change to MMP, with 53.9% of voters opting to change to MMP.\n\nWhile  [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] usually stood candidates in every seat, National was one candidate short as their [[Southern Maori]] candidate apparently did not apply in time.\n\n==The election==\nThe election was held on 6 November. 2,321,664 people were registered to vote, and 85.2% turned out. This turnout was almost exactly the same as for the previous election, although slightly less than what would be seen for the following one.\n\n==Summary of results==\nPreliminary results based on election night counts saw the country facing its first [[hung parliament]] since 1931, with no party gaining the 50 seats required for a majority. The National Party won 49 seats, a drop of 15 from before the election, and Labour had won 46 seats, with the balance of power held with the Alliance and New Zealand First, which won two seats each.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-11-08/news/9311080410_1_new-zealand-zealand-first-party-seat |title= A Hung Parliament Seems Likely For New Zealand |publisher= Orlando Sentinel |date= 8 November 1993 |accessdate= 25 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"nathistory\">{{cite web |url= http://www.national.org.nz/About/history.aspx |title= History of the National Party |publisher= [[New Zealand National Party]] |accessdate= 25 October 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140416120337/http://www.national.org.nz/About/history.aspx |archivedate= 16 April 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> This led to [[Jim Bolger]] saying on public television, \"bugger the pollsters\" as he had been led to expect a comfortable National victory by the polls showing that National would win easily.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/327947/pollsters,-prophets-and-politics-on-the-ball-or-off-the-mark|title=Pollsters, prophets and politics: On the ball or off the mark?|first=Craig|last=McCulloch|date=2 April 2017|publisher=Radio New Zealand}}</ref> Labour leader [[Mike Moore (New Zealand politician)|Mike Moore]] delivered a speech later described by political scientist Jack Vowles as \"damaging\" and \"more appropriate for a decisive Labour win than a narrow defeat.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vowles |first1=Jack |title=Voters' Victory?: New Zealand's First Election under Proportional Representation |date=2013 |publisher=Auckland University Press |isbn=9781869407131 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEFeAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT29&lpg=PT29&dq=mike+moore+1993+election+night+speech&source=bl&ots=JbFCzmBQRU&sig=ACfU3U0_esPZlepSWugS8Z1zI1NjoYlAjA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEqMb57JTkAhWo8HMBHdFHAb4Q6AEwEHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=mike%20moore%201993%20election%20night%20speech&f=false}}</ref>\n\nOn election night result with the two major parties tied, the Governor-General Dame [[Catherine Tizard]] asked Sir [[David Beattie]] to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as prime minister.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Governors: New Zealand's Governors and Governors-General|first=Gavin|last=McLean|publisher=Otago University Press|isbn=1-877372-25-0|date=2006}}</ref> However National won one more seat and was returned to power when the official count saw the seat of [[Waitaki (New Zealand electorate)|Waitaki]] swing from Labour to National, giving National 50 seats and Labour 45 seats.

[[44th New Zealand Parliament]]. Voters elected 99 members to the [[House of Representatives (New Zealand)|House of Representatives]], up from 97 members at the 1990 election. The election was the last general election to use the [[first-past-the-post]] electoral system, with all members elected from single-member [[New Zealand electorates|electorates]].\n\nThe election saw the governing [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]], led by [[Jim Bolger]], win a second term in office, despite a major swing away from National in both seats and votes. The opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]], despite a slight drop in their support, managed to make gains in terms of seats. The new [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]] and [[New Zealand First]] parties gained significant shares of the vote, but won few seats. \n\n==Background==\nBefore the election, the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] governed with 64 seats, while the opposition [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] held only 29. The [[1990 New Zealand general election|1990 election]] had been a major victory for the National Party, with the unpopular Fourth Labour Government being decisively defeated. The Labour Party had become unpopular for its ongoing economic reforms, which were based around [[liberalisation]], [[privatisation]], and the removal of [[tariff]]s and [[subsidy|subsidies]]. The National Party was somewhat divided as to the merits of the reforms, with conservatives generally opposed and neoliberals generally in favour. The party had fought the 1990 election saying that the Labour government's program was too radical, and was being carried out without any thought of the social consequences \u2013 [[Jim Bolger]] spoke about \"the Decent Society\", promising a return to a more moderate and balanced platform. Once in government, however, the key [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]] role was taken not by a moderate but by [[Ruth Richardson]], who wished to expand, not end, the economic reforms. Many of the voters who had felt betrayed by Labour's reforms now felt betrayed by the National Party as well, a fact which contributed to the rise of minor parties.\n\nThe [[Alliance (New Zealand political party)|Alliance]], the largest \"third party\", was a broad coalition of five smaller groups \u2013 the [[NewLabour Party (New Zealand)|NewLabour Party]] (a Labour splinter), the [[Democratic Party of New Zealand|Democrats]] (a [[social credit]] party), the [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Greens]] (an [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] party), [[Mana Motuhake (political party)|Mana Motuhake]] (a [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] party), and the [[New Zealand Liberal Party (1992)|Liberal Party]] (a National splinter). The Alliance held three seats in Parliament \u2013 one belonged to [[Jim Anderton]], who had been re-elected under a NewLabour banner in the seat he had formerly held for Labour, while the other two belonged to the National MPs who formed the Liberal Party. In its first electoral test, the [[1992 Tamaki by-election|1992 by-election in Tamaki]], the Alliance had performed well, taking second place. Another smaller group was [[New Zealand First]], a party established by former National MP [[Winston Peters]]. Peters had broken with his party after a number of policy disputes with its leadership, and resigned from parliament to contest his seat as an independent. After being overwhelmingly re-elected, Peters established New Zealand First to promote his views. Peters was the party's sole MP.\n\nAnother consequence of dissatisfaction with both major parties was the referendum conducted alongside the 1993 election. The culmination of the larger decade-long [[Electoral reform in New Zealand|New Zealand electoral reform]] process, the referendum was held following the September 1992 indicative referendum, which saw 85% of voters voting for change from the existing First Past The Post (FPP) system, and 70% choosing the [[Mixed-member proportional representation|Mixed Member Proportional]] (MMP) as its preferred replacement: a [[proportional representation|proportional]] system which would make it easier for smaller parties to win seats. It asked voters to choose whether to keep the existing FPP system or change to MMP, with 53.9% of voters opting to change to MMP.\n\nWhile  [[New Zealand National Party|National]] and [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]] usually stood candidates in every seat, National was one candidate short as their [[Southern Maori]] candidate apparently did not apply in time.\n\n==The election==\nThe election was held on 6 November. 2,321,664 people were registered to vote, and 85.2% turned out. This turnout was almost exactly the same as for the previous election, although slightly less than what would be seen for the following one.\n\n==Summary of results==\nPreliminary results based on election night counts saw the country facing its first [[hung parliament]] since 1931, with no party gaining the 50 seats required for a majority. The National Party won 49 seats, a drop of 15 from before the election, and Labour had won 46 seats, with the balance of power held with the Alliance and New Zealand First, which won two seats each.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1993-11-08/news/9311080410_1_new-zealand-zealand-first-party-seat |title= A Hung Parliament Seems Likely For New Zealand |publisher= Orlando Sentinel |date= 8 November 1993 |accessdate= 25 October 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"nathistory\">{{cite web |url= http://www.national.org.nz/About/history.aspx |title= History of the National Party |publisher= [[New Zealand National Party]] |accessdate= 25 October 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140416120337/http://www.national.org.nz/About/history.aspx |archivedate= 16 April 2014 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> This led to [[Jim Bolger]] saying on public television, \"bugger the pollsters\" as he had been led to expect a comfortable National victory by the polls showing that National would win easily.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/political/327947/pollsters,-prophets-and-politics-on-the-ball-or-off-the-mark|title=Pollsters, prophets and politics: On the ball or off the mark?|first=Craig|last=McCulloch|date=2 April 2017|publisher=Radio New Zealand}}</ref> Labour leader, [[Mike Moore (New Zealand politician)|Mike Moore]] delivered a speech later described by political scientist Jack Vowles as \"damaging\" and \"more appropriate for a decisive Labour win than a narrow defeat.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Vowles |first1=Jack |title=Voters' Victory?: New Zealand's First Election under Proportional Representation |date=2013 |publisher=Auckland University Press |isbn=9781869407131 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PEFeAwAAQBAJ&pg=PT29&lpg=PT29&dq=mike+moore+1993+election+night+speech&source=bl&ots=JbFCzmBQRU&sig=ACfU3U0_esPZlepSWugS8Z1zI1NjoYlAjA&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiEqMb57JTkAhWo8HMBHdFHAb4Q6AEwEHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=mike%20moore%201993%20election%20night%20speech&f=false}}</ref>\n\nOn election night result with the two major parties tied, the Governor-General Dame [[Catherine Tizard]] asked Sir [[David Beattie]] to form a committee, along with three retired appeal court judges, to decide whom to appoint as prime minister.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Governors: New Zealand's Governors and Governors-General|first=Gavin|last=McLean|publisher=Otago University Press|isbn=1-877372-25-0|date=2006}}</ref> However National won one more seat and was returned to power when the official count saw the seat of [[Waitaki (New Zealand electorate)|Waitaki]] swing from Labour to National, giving National 50 seats and Labour 45 seats.
