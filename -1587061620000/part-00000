It was released in North America in June 1991, and in [[PAL regions]] and Japan the following month. The game features an [[anthropomorphic]] hedgehog named [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] in a quest to defeat [[Dr. Robotnik]], a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the powerful [[Chaos Emeralds]]. The gameplay involves collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] as a form of [[health (gaming)|health]], and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.\n\nDevelopment began in 1990 when Sega ordered [[List of Sega software development studios|its developers]] to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog and named themselves \"Sonic Team\" to match their character. ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by ''[[Super Mario]]'' series creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a [[Technology demonstration#Computers and gaming|tech demo]] created by programmer [[Yuji Naka]].\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit era]] and allowing it to compete with [[Nintendo]] and their [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. The game has been [[Porting#Porting of video games|ported]] a number of times, and inspired several [[video game clone|clones]], a successful [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|franchise]], and adaptations into other media. It is often cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]].\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:MD Sonic the Hedgehog.png|thumb|left|A typical in-game screenshot, taken from the first [[level (video gaming)|level]], [[Green Hill Zone]]]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling]]\u2013[[platform video game]]. The gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and [[vertical loop]]s.<ref name=\"alive\" /> The levels are populated with hazards in the form of robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals.  Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game.<ref name=\"allgame\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1709&tab=overview|publisher=[[Allgame]]|title=Sonic the Hedgehog|last=Mariott|first=Scott Alan|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref> The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents.<ref name=\"cvg\" /> Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision. This may be performed by jumping or by rolling on the ground.<ref name=\"Official player's guide 12\">Official player's guide, p. 12.</ref>\n\nAt the start of the game, the player is given three lives, each of which may be lost if Sonic collides with hazardous enemies or objects while in possession of no rings, falls to the bottom of the level screen, or exceeds an act's ten-minute time limit.

Each main zone has its own visual style, and while some enemies appear throughout, each zone has unique enemies and obstacles.<ref>Certain Victory Guide Book, pp. 3,4.</ref> Each main zone is split into three acts,<ref name=\"alive\" /><ref name=\"cvg\" /> all of which must be completed. At the end of each main zone's third act, the player confronts Dr. Robotnik for a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fight]].  For most of the fights, Robotnik's vehicle is fitted with different weapons.<ref>Official player's guide, pp. 20,28,36,44,52.</ref> After completing the sixth zone, the player continues directly to the single-level \"Final Zone\" for a last encounter with Robotnik inside a large machine environment.<ref name=\"game\" />  Destroying Robotnik's machine ends the game.  A brief animation shows Sonic's return to the first zone, with animals liberated from Dr. Robotnik.\n\nOptionally, if Sonic reaches the end of any zone's Act 1 or Act 2 while holding at least 50 rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a \"[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Special Stages|special stage]]\". In the Special Stages, Sonic is continually curled up in his Spin Attack animation, and bounces off the bumpers and walls of a fully rotating maze. In these levels, the player earns a number of [[Continue (video gaming)|continues]] for each multiple of 50 rings collected, but the main goal is to obtain the Chaos Emerald hidden within the maze.  Colliding with any of the blocks marked \"GOAL\" ends the level.<ref name=\"cvg\" /><ref>Official player's guide, p. 61.</ref>\n\n===Plot===\nIn an attempt to steal the six<!--This game features six Chaos Emeralds, not the seven that appear in the sequels--> Chaos Emeralds and harness their power, the evil [[Dr. Ivo Robotnik]]{{efn|Known as Dr. Eggman in the Japanese version}} has trapped the animal inhabitants of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules.

He was working with Naka with a prototype game, and Ohshima was thinking of design ideas with the toy and stationery department. Before Sonic was chosen, other characters, including a rabbit and a bearded man who would ultimately become Dr. Robotnik, were created. One summer, Ohshima went on vacation to New York, taking sketches with him. He went to [[Central Park]] and asked locals for their opinions on them, and Sonic was the favorite. Ohshima explained that this was because he wanted support for his ideas.\n\nSonic was originally teal-colored,<ref name=\"retro\" /> then a light shade of blue, but he was changed to dark blue so he would stand out against certain backgrounds<ref>{{cite web|last=Horowitz|first=Ken|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2006/12/interview-mark-cerny/|title=Interview: Mark Cerny|publisher=Sega-16|date=December 5, 2006|accessdate=October 12, 2014|quote='''Mark Cerny:''' Sonic had been a lighter blue, but he was very hard to see against the ocean backgrounds, so his color was darkened at the last moment.}}</ref> and to match the Sega logo.

Catching items and throwing them caused the action's rhythm to break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]] came onto the team to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments visual complexity, with particular focus on the colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up.<ref name=\"Zone1\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Les Editions Pix'n Love|title=The History Of Sonic the Hedgehog|date=2013|publisher=UDON Entertainment Corp|location=Ontario|isbn=978-1-926778-96-9|pages=20\u201333|chapter=Zone 1 Genesis}}</ref>\n\nDue to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, it was slowed down.<ref name=\"Zone1\" />\n\nThe gameplay originated with a tech demo by Naka, who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a [[dot matrix]]. Naka's prototype was a platform game with a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long, winding tube, and this concept was fleshed out with Ohshima's character designs and levels by Yasuhara.<ref name=\"Yasuhara\">{{cite magazine|author=GI Staff|title=Sonic's Architect: GI Interviews Hirokazu Yasuhara|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issue=124|volume=13|date=August 2003|pages=114\u2013116}}</ref> Yasuhara originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the [[Gulf War]], but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year.<ref name=\"Yasuhara\" /><ref name=\"Birth\">{{cite magazine|last=Thomason|first=Steve|title=Birth of a Hedgehog|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|issue=211|volume=20|date=January 2007|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|page=72}}</ref> His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design.<ref name=\"retro\" /> The color scheme was influenced by the work of [[pop art]]ist Eizin Suzuki, and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of [[California]].<ref name=\"retro\" />\n\nIn designing the gameplay, Naka was inspired by ''Mario'' creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a [[D-pad|directional pad]] for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more [[action game|action]]-oriented than the ''Mario'' series;<ref name=\"edge\" /> while playing ''Super Mario Bros.'', he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.<ref name=\"retro\" />\n\nNaka, Ohshima, and Yasuhara worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months.<ref name=\"Yasuhara\" /> Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis' technological prowess, the game underwent extensive testing and redesign, which took over six months. According to Naka, the game had the fastest-ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that had been considered impossible on the console.<ref name=\"edge\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|issue=101|title=The Making of&nbsp;...

A two-player mode appeared in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992), whereby the second player controls Sonic's sidekick [[Tails (character)|Miles \"Tails\" Prower]].<ref name=\"retro\" /> Sonic Team also intended to include a [[sound test]] with animations of Sonic [[breakdancing]] to a band of animal characters; including a crocodile keyboardist who was later introduced into the series as [[Vector the Crocodile]] in ''[[Knuckles' Chaotix]]'' in 1995.<ref name=\"soundtest\">{{cite web|url=http://xbox.gamespy.com/articles/654/654750p5.html|title=Sega's Yuji Naka Talks!|last=Kemps|first=Heidi|date=September 30, 2005|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=September 23, 2004}}</ref> The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the \"''Se-ga!''\" chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound.<ref name=\"soundtest\" />\n\nNaka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code.<ref name=\"facts\" /> Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch.<ref name=NakaInt /><ref name=\"Zone1\" /> He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\".<ref name=NakaInt /> Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards.<ref name=NakaIntHist /> The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on [[Humpty Dumpty]].<ref name=OhshimaInt>{{cite interview||subject=Naoto Ohshima|work=Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Collected Works|year=2014|pages=328,329|publisher=Read-Only Memory|isbn=978-0-9575768-1-0|title=Naoto Ohshima Visual Designer}}</ref>\n\nYasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer [[Yu Suzuki]], who used this technique with ''[[Space Harrier (video game)|Space Harrier]]''. The team read ''[[Famitsu Magazine|Famitsu]]'' to stay informed of what their rivals were doing so they could avoid their mistakes.<ref name=\"Zone1\" />\n\n=== Music ===\nSega director Fujio Minegishi had connections to the music industry, and suggested his friend [[Y\u016bz\u014d Kayama]] write the ''Sonic'' score.

It was released in North America in June 1991, and in [[PAL regions]] and Japan the following month. The game features an [[anthropomorphic]] hedgehog named [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] in a quest to defeat [[Dr. Robotnik]], a scientist who has imprisoned animals in robots and stolen the powerful [[Chaos Emeralds]]. The gameplay involves collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] as a form of [[health (gaming)|health]], and a simple control scheme, with jumping and attacking controlled by a single button.\n\nDevelopment began in 1990 when Sega ordered [[List of Sega software development studios|its developers]] to create a game featuring a mascot for the company. After considering a number of suggestions, the developers decided on a blue hedgehog and named themselves \"Sonic Team\" to match their character. ''Sonic the Hedgehog'', designed for fast gameplay, was influenced by games by ''[[Super Mario]]'' series creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]]. ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' uses a novel technique that allows Sonic's [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] to roll along curved scenery, which originated in a [[Technology demonstration#Computers and gaming|tech demo]] created by programmer [[Yuji Naka]].\n\n''Sonic the Hedgehog'' was well received by critics, who praised its visuals, audio, and gameplay. It was also commercially successful, establishing the Genesis as a key player in the [[Fourth generation of video game consoles|16-bit era]] and allowing it to compete with [[Nintendo]] and their [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] console. The game has been [[Porting#Porting of video games|ported]] a number of times, and inspired several [[video game clone|clones]], a successful [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|franchise]], and adaptations into other media.

The gameplay centers around Sonic's ability to run at high speed through levels that include springs, slopes, bottomless pits, and [[vertical loop]]s.<ref name=\"alive\" /> The levels are populated with hazards in the form of robots inside which Dr. Robotnik has trapped animals.  Destroying a robot frees the creature, but is not necessary to complete the game.<ref name=\"allgame\">{{cite web|url=http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1709&tab=overview|publisher=[[Allgame]]|title=Sonic the Hedgehog|last=Mariott|first=Scott Alan|accessdate=February 6, 2014}}</ref> The player must also avoid touching spikes, falling into bottomless pits, and being crushed by moving walls or platforms, as well as drowning, which may be prevented by breathing air bubbles from vents.<ref name=\"cvg\" /> Sonic's main means of attack is the Spin Attack, in which he curls into a ball and rapidly spins his body, damaging enemies and certain obstacles upon collision.

A brief animation shows Sonic's return to the first zone, with animals liberated from Dr. Robotnik.\n\nOptionally, if Sonic reaches the end of any zone's Act 1 or Act 2 while holding at least 50 rings, a large ring appears through which he can jump to enter a \"[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Special Stages|special stage]]\". In the Special Stages, Sonic is continually curled up in his Spin Attack animation, and bounces off the bumpers and walls of a fully rotating maze.

Before Sonic was chosen, other characters, including a rabbit and a bearded man who would ultimately become Dr. Robotnik, were created. One summer, Ohshima went on vacation to New York, taking sketches with him. He went to [[Central Park]] and asked locals for their opinions on them, and Sonic was the favorite.

Catching items and throwing them caused the action's rhythm to break. Naka stated that the rabbit was not suitable for his game engine, and he also wanted the game to be playable with only one button. [[Hirokazu Yasuhara]] came onto the team to supervise Naka and Ohshima and develop levels. He became the lead designer due to his greater experience, and found the way to make the game playable with only one button by having Sonic do damage by jumping. The trio came up with the idea of him rolling into a ball. After the hedgehog character was chosen, many characters were redrawn, and the team agreed on the environments visual complexity, with particular focus on the colors. After this, four people came onto the team to speed development up.<ref name=\"Zone1\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Les Editions Pix'n Love|title=The History Of Sonic the Hedgehog|date=2013|publisher=UDON Entertainment Corp|location=Ontario|isbn=978-1-926778-96-9|pages=20\u201333|chapter=Zone 1 Genesis}}</ref>\n\nDue to the popularity of Mario, Naka wanted Sonic to take over the American market. Sonic's default speed was set to that of Mario while running. Tests were run using the Genesis' tool library, and problems such as flickering, slow frame rates, and shaky animation soon became apparent. Increasing Sonic's speed caused animation problems. Naka solved the problem by developing an algorithm that enabled the animation to retain fluidity. Sonic was able to cross levels quickly without the animation slowing down, and all that was left was the optimization of the game's speed to adhere to the staff's expectations. The team noticed that different people had different perceptions of the game's speed: some believed it was too fast, which caused disagreements. As a result, it was slowed down.<ref name=\"Zone1\" />\n\nThe gameplay originated with a tech demo by Naka, who developed an algorithm allowing a sprite to move smoothly on a curve by determining its position with a [[dot matrix]]. Naka's prototype was a platform game with a fast-moving character rolling in a ball through a long, winding tube, and this concept was fleshed out with Ohshima's character designs and levels by Yasuhara.<ref name=\"Yasuhara\">{{cite magazine|author=GI Staff|title=Sonic's Architect: GI Interviews Hirokazu Yasuhara|magazine=[[Game Informer]]|issue=124|volume=13|date=August 2003|pages=114\u2013116}}</ref> Yasuhara originally intended to work on the game for three months due to the delay of his planned move to the United States by the outbreak of the [[Gulf War]], but was engrossed in the project for nearly a year.<ref name=\"Yasuhara\" /><ref name=\"Birth\">{{cite magazine|last=Thomason|first=Steve|title=Birth of a Hedgehog|magazine=[[Nintendo Power]]|issue=211|volume=20|date=January 2007|publisher=[[Future Publishing]]|page=72}}</ref> His designs for levels were intended to attract both hardcore and casual gamers by integrating occasional challenging set pieces into the mostly accessible level design.<ref name=\"retro\" /> The color scheme was influenced by the work of [[pop art]]ist Eizin Suzuki, and the aesthetics of Green Hill were influenced by the geography of [[California]].<ref name=\"retro\" />\n\nIn designing the gameplay, Naka was inspired by ''Mario'' creator [[Shigeru Miyamoto]], whose games he had enjoyed playing years earlier. Admiring the simplicity of Miyamoto's mechanics in complex environments, Naka decided that Sonic would be controlled with only a [[D-pad|directional pad]] for movement and a single button for jumping. He also wanted his creation to be more [[action game|action]]-oriented than the ''Mario'' series;<ref name=\"edge\" /> while playing ''Super Mario Bros.'', he had wondered why the levels could not be cleared more quickly.<ref name=\"retro\" />\n\nNaka, Ohshima, and Yasuhara worked 19 hours a day on the project for several months.<ref name=\"Yasuhara\" /> Due to the need to demonstrate the Genesis' technological prowess, the game underwent extensive testing and redesign, which took over six months. According to Naka, the game had the fastest-ever character speed in a video game and a rotation effect in the special stages that had been considered impossible on the console.<ref name=\"edge\">{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]|issue=101|title=The Making of&nbsp;...

A two-player mode appeared in ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992), whereby the second player controls Sonic's sidekick [[Tails (character)|Miles \"Tails\" Prower]].<ref name=\"retro\" /> Sonic Team also intended to include a [[sound test]] with animations of Sonic [[breakdancing]] to a band of animal characters; including a crocodile keyboardist who was later introduced into the series as [[Vector the Crocodile]] in ''[[Knuckles' Chaotix]]'' in 1995.<ref name=\"soundtest\">{{cite web|url=http://xbox.gamespy.com/articles/654/654750p5.html|title=Sega's Yuji Naka Talks!|last=Kemps|first=Heidi|date=September 30, 2005|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|accessdate=September 23, 2004}}</ref> The sound test was scrapped for time reasons and Naka used the freed up memory to add the \"''Se-ga!''\" chant used in TV commercials as a startup sound.<ref name=\"soundtest\" />\n\nNaka's relationship with Sega was tenuous during this time, and he received little credit for his work. He left the company shortly after the game's release, although Sega of America hired him later. Before leaving, however, he defied Sega's prohibition of developer credits by displaying a few names in black text on a black background, identifiable only by looking at the code.<ref name=\"facts\" /> Naka stated that level design was a major challenge: he created maps much wider than normal and tried to ensure players would not get lost. It took him around eight months to develop Green Hill Zone as he kept restarting from scratch.<ref name=NakaInt /><ref name=\"Zone1\" /> He stated that he found the process \"very interesting\".<ref name=NakaInt /> Naka also stated that the team was trying to create smooth maps, and that implementing looping structures was a challenge because Sonic would break through them instead of running around them. The backgrounds were also a challenge, as the game's speed created the impression of going backwards.<ref name=NakaIntHist /> The zones were based on designs by Naka and Ohshima, with the goal of creating the world's fastest action game. According to Ohshima, Robotnik was based on [[Humpty Dumpty]].<ref name=OhshimaInt>{{cite interview||subject=Naoto Ohshima|work=Sega Mega Drive/Genesis Collected Works|year=2014|pages=328,329|publisher=Read-Only Memory|isbn=978-0-9575768-1-0|title=Naoto Ohshima Visual Designer}}</ref>\n\nYasuhara wanted the game to appeal to both Japanese and American players, which was why Green Hill Zone was redesigned many times. Sonic Team wanted the level to portray the character correctly. Its checkered ground was inspired by 3D image rendering from computers, an idea Naka obtained from Sega developer [[Yu Suzuki]], who used this technique with ''[[Space Harrier (video game)|Space Harrier]]''.

The college was established in 1869 by [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] as the first [[women's college]] in Cambridge. In 1948, it was granted full college status by the university, marking the official admittance of women to the university. In 1976, it was the first Cambridge women's college to become [[mixed-sex education|coeducational]].\n\nThe main College site, situated on the outskirts of the village of [[Girton, Cambridgeshire|Girton]], about 2.5&nbsp;miles (4&nbsp;km) northwest of the university town, comprises {{convert|33|acre|ha|1}} of land. In a typical [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] red brick design, most was built by architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] between 1872 and 1887. It provides extensive sports facilities, an indoor swimming pool, an award-winning library and a chapel with two organs. There is an accommodation annexe, known as Swirles Court, situated in the Eddington neighborhood of the [[North West Cambridge development]]. Swirles opened in 2017 and provides up to 325 en-suite single rooms for graduates, and for second-year undergraduates and above.\n\nThe College has several equal-access admittance schemes.

No one likes us, but we don't care''!, in imitation of the [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] fans' famous song: ''[[No one likes us, we don't care]]''. The reference to ''no one likes us'' is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison to many of the other colleges. In 2016 the Casual Choir performed ''Long Way to Girton College'', an adaptation of ''[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]'', written and arranged by two choir members.\n\nThe college song ''I love to go a-bicycling'', sung with the tune of'' I love to go a-wandering'' also alludes to Girton's 2.5 miles distance from the town centre. It has been sung since the 1960s.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> For example, the second stanza reads:\n<blockquote><poem>But when I climb up Castle Hill\nIn the wind and squall\nA strong desire does then me fill\nTo be-e at [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|New Hall]].\n\n''Chorus:''\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra,\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra-a-a-a-\n.... To be-e at New Hall.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother song, composed in 1972 by [[Common Room (university)|JCR]] president Anna Cocconi,<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> is called ''Song to Wolfson Court''. The annexe of the college was opened in that year. Students often found fault with the modern architecture of the building, which was less spacious and elegant than the main site. The first two stanzas go as follows:\n<blockquote><poem> In a wheat field, west of Cambridge,\nOff a lane called Clarkson Road,\nWolfson Court is standing proudly;\nLet its story now be told\n\nHundred rooms with running water,\nCould you ever ask for more?\nNot unless you choose a boy-friend,\nMeas\u2019ring over five foot four!<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Girton College Boat Club]]\n* [[:Category:Alumni of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n* [[:Category:Fellows of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n\n===Eponymous institutions===\n*[[Girton Grammar School]], [[Bendigo, Victoria]], [[Australia]]\n*[[Girton Hall]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]\n\n===Official College Website===\n*[http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/ Girton College]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Books\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |title=Life at Girton College |last=a Girton student |author-link= |year=1882 |publisher=(no publisher) |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |access-date=}}\n*{{cite book |title = 'That Infidel Place'.

The college was established in 1869 by [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] as the first [[women's college]] in Cambridge. In 1948, it was granted full college status by the university, marking the official admittance of women to the university. In 1976, it was the first Cambridge women's college to become [[mixed-sex education|coeducational]].\n\nThe main College site, situated on the outskirts of the village of [[Girton, Cambridgeshire|Girton]], about 2.5&nbsp;miles (4&nbsp;km) northwest of the university town, comprises {{convert|33|acre|ha|1}} of land. In a typical [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] red brick design, most was built by architect [[Alfred Waterhouse]] between 1872 and 1887. It provides extensive sports facilities, an indoor swimming pool, an award-winning library and a chapel with two organs. There is an accommodation annexe, known as Swirles Court, situated in the Eddington neighborhood of the [[North West Cambridge development]]. Swirles opened in 2017 and provides up to 325 en-suite single rooms for graduates, and for second-year undergraduates and above.\n\nThe College has several equal-access admittance schemes. It has a reputation for musical talent. Several art collections are held on the main site, including ''People's Portraits'', the millennial exhibition of the [[Royal Society of Portrait Painters]], and an Egyptian collection containing the world's most reproduced [[Fayum mummy portraits|portrait mummy]].\n\nAmong Girton's notable alumni are Queen [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], [[President of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|UK Supreme Court President]] [[Brenda Hale, Baroness Hale of Richmond|Lady Hale]], ''[[HuffPost]]'' co-founder [[Arianna Huffington]], the comedian/author [[Sandi Toksvig]], the comedian/broadcaster/GP [[Phil Hammond (comedian)|Phil Hammond]], the economist [[Joan Robinson]], and the anthropologist [[Marilyn Strathern]], also Mistress from 1998 to 2009.\n\nIts [[sister college]] is [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], one of the first two women's colleges of [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Cambridge - Girton College Main Gate - June 2018.jpg|thumb|Main gate with porter's lodge]]\n\n===1869 to 1976: Pioneering for women's education===\nThe early feminist movement began to argue for the improvement of women's education in the 1860s<!--Mary Lyon opened Mount Holyoke for that purpose in 1837-->: [[Emily Davies]] and [[Barbara Bodichon]] met through their activism at the [[Society for Promoting the Employment of Women|Society for the Employment of Women]] and the [[Englishwoman's Review]].<ref>Stephen 1933, p.6</ref> They shared the aim of securing women's admission to university.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.7</ref> In particular, they wanted to determine whether girls could be admitted at Oxford or Cambridge to sit the Senior and Junior Local Examinations.<ref>Megson and Lindsay 1961, pp.1\u20132</ref> Davies and Bodichon set up a committee to that effect in 1862. In 1865, with the help of Henry Tomkinson, [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] alumnus and owner of an insurance company with good contacts within the University,<ref>Bradbrook 1969, p.7</ref> 91 female students entered the Cambridge Local Examination.<ref>Megson and Lindsay 1961, p.2</ref> This first concession to women's educational rights met relatively little resistance, as admission to the examination did not imply residence of women at the university site.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.10</ref>\n\n[[File:Girton College Water Colour.jpg|thumb|Water colour by the architect of Girton College Alfred Waterhouse]]\nAt that time, students had the option of doing a Pass degree, which consisted of \"a disorderly collection of fragmented learning\",<ref>Brooke p.209</ref> or an [[Honours degree]], which at that time meant the Mathematics [[Tripos]], classics, natural or moral sciences. An Honours degree was considered more challenging than the Pass degree. In 1869, [[Henry Sidgwick]] helped institute the Examinations for Women, which was designed to be of intermediate difficulty.<ref>Winstanley 1977 p.154</ref> This idea was heavily opposed by Emily Davies, as she demanded admittance to the Tripos examinations.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.23</ref>\n\nThe college was established on 16 October 1869 under the name of the '''College for Women at Benslow House''' in [[Hitchin]], Hertfordshire, which was considered to be a convenient distance from Cambridge and London.<ref>Jones 1913, pp.16\u201317</ref> It was thought to be less \"risky\" and less controversial to locate the college away from Cambridge in the beginning.<ref>Stephen 1933, p.25</ref> The college was one of [[England]]'s first residential colleges for women. ([[Whitelands College]], now part of the [[University of Roehampton]], was established as a college of higher education for women earlier, in 1841.)

In 1884, Hospital Wing was completed, and Orchard Wing, Stanley Library and the Old Kitchens added. At that time, Girton had 80 students. By 1902, Tower Wing, Chapel Wing and Woodlands Wing as well as the Chapel and the Hall were finished, which allowed the college to accommodate 180 students.<ref name=\"Bradbrook 1969, p.161\" />\n\nIn 1921, a committee was appointed to draft a charter for the college.

Girton and [[Newnham College, Cambridge|Newnham]] were classed as \"recognised institutions for the higher education for women\", not colleges of the university. On 27 April 1948, women were admitted to full membership of the University of Cambridge, and Girton College received the status of a college of the university.\n\n===1976 to present: Pioneering for sexual equality===\nSocial and cultural changes in the [[Aftermath of World War II|post-war period]] led to an increasing number of British universities to become co-educational.

Only one all-female corridor in which rooms were reserved exclusively for women remained. Upon the arrival of male undergraduates, [[Common Room (university)|JCR and MCR]] social facilities had to be enlarged. The college bar was opened in 1979 as well as rugby, cricket and soccer pitches provided from 1982 onwards.<ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.73</ref><ref>Horsler and Strathern 2005, p.40</ref>\n\nIn the 22-year period from 1997 to 2019, the [[Tompkins Table]] annual ranking of Cambridge colleges by undergraduate academic performance ranked Girton College an average of 20 out of the 29 colleges researched.

Tomkinson, [[Barbara Bodichon|Madame Bodichon (n\u00e9e Leigh Smith)]], [[Henrietta Stanley, Baroness Stanley of Alderley]] (daughter of the [[Henry Dillon, 13th Viscount Dillon|13th Viscount Dillon]]), and Miss [[Emily Davies]] who did not have arms and was instead represented by the [[Flag of Wales|Welsh colours]], [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]] and [[argent]]. The Rev. [[Edward Earle Dorling]] submitted a great variety of designs to the council, however the task was not easy. \"A patch-work of elaborate charges and many colours was to be avoided. Mr Tomkinson's fascinating martlets and Lady Stanley's lion had to be abandoned with regret, as was also a design of green and silver chequers which would have given more prominence to Miss [[Emily Davies|Davies]].\"<ref>Girton Review, Michaelmas 1928, pp. 2\u20134</ref>\n\nFinally in 1928 the design was accepted by all and the College was granted the following:\n\n<blockquote>We \u2026 grant and assign unto The [[Mistress (college)|Mistress]] and Governors of Girton College the Arms following that is to say: Quarterly [[Vert (heraldry)|Vert]] and [[Argent]] a [[cross flory]] countercharged a [[Roundel (heraldry)|Roundel]] [[Ermine (heraldry)|Ermine]] and in the second and third quarters a [[Crescent]] [[Gules]], \u2026 to be borne and used for ever, hereafter by the Mistress and Governors of Girton College and by their Successors upon Seals Shields or otherwise according to the Laws of Arms.<ref>{{cite journal | last = K\u00f3czy| first = L\u00e1szl\u00f3 \u00c1.| authorlink = | title = Girton College and its Arms| journal = The Escutcheon| volume = 2| issue = 3| pages =| publisher = [[Cambridge University Heraldic and Genealogical Society]]| location = Cambridge| year = 1997|url = http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cuhags/escutcheon/1996-97/ar_girtn.htm| doi =|accessdate=27 June 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314010013/http://www.societies.cam.ac.uk/cuhags/escutcheon/1996-97/ar_girtn.htm|archivedate=2012-03-14}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n===Gown===\n\nThe college gown has the standard pattern of an [[Academic dress of the University of Cambridge|undergraduate gown at the University of Cambridge]], with the sleeves sewn up for a length of eight inches from the shoulder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/students/guide/academic-matters |title=Academic matters |author=Girton College |year=2010 |website= |accessdate=22 June 2011}}</ref> The proper dress of the gown and cap was observed at the first honorary degree to a woman, given to the [[Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon|Queen]], an [[Doctor of Laws|LL.D]]. on 21 October 1948. As [[Academic dress of the University of Cambridge|academic dress]], gowns were adopted with little changes (the sleeves had to be closed so that even in the summer, when women wear short-sleeved dresses their bare shoulders do not show), and square caps were chosen as head-dress. However, to remember the time when women were not allowed to obtain degrees of the University of Cambridge, no gowns are worn during the college feast, when students in their final year are celebrated.\n\n===Graces===\nGirton College has a traditional two-word grace and a more recent full grace, both in Latin.  On regular formal occasions, such as [[Formal (university)|Formal Halls]], the two-word graces are spoken, ''Benedictus benedicat'' (May the blessed one give blessing) at the start of the meal, and ''Benedictus benedicatur'' (May praise be given to the blessed one) at the end of the meal. There is evidence that the two-word grace was used in 1926, and it is thought the two-word grace <!-- is that grace, singular, or graces, plural? what exactly does Freeman refer to? --> was used from the foundation of the college onwards.<ref>{{cite book |title=Alma Mater: Memoirs of Girton College 1926\u20131929 |last=Freeman |first=Gwendolen |authorlink= |year=1993 |publisher=David and Charles |location=Devon |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |accessdate= |asin=}}</ref>\n\nThe words and the music of the full grace were composed in 1950 by Alison Duke and Jill Vlasto respectively.<ref name=\"Wheeler 2002\">{{cite journal | last = Wheeler| first = Graham| authorlink = | title = Dining graces at Cambridge colleges| journal =| volume = | issue = | pages =| publisher = paper presented to the Interdisciplinary Seminar, Faculty of Classics| location = Cambridge| year = 2002|url =| doi =}}</ref> The grace came after the admission of women to full membership of the university so as to bring Girton in line with the other colleges.<ref name=\"Wheeler 2002\"/> It is used on the most formal occasions, such as the Foundation Dinner, and it is sung once a year at the College Feast, which all final year students attend.\n\nFull grace (in Latin):\n\n<blockquote><poem>''Benedic Domine, nobis et omnibus huius collegii alumnis,\ndonisque tuis quae de munificentia tua sumus iam sumpturi;\net illis salubriter nutriti debitas tibi gratias pie reddamus.\nCustodi, quaesumus, Domine, filios et filias\net consule necessitatibus animarum et corporum,\nhoc ipso momento et in aeternum.''</poem></blockquote>\n\nFull grace (English translation):\n<blockquote><poem>Bless us, O Lord, and all members of this college,\nand also thy gifts, which of thy bounty we are about to receive;\nand having been wholesomely nourished by the same let us dutifully render to thee the thanks that are owed.\nProtect, we beseech thee, O Lord, thy sons and daughters and provide for the needs both of our souls and bodies,\nat this present time and for evermore.</poem></blockquote>\n\n===Songs===\n[[File:The Girton Pioneers.jpg|thumb|right|''The Girton Pioneers'' (tune of [[The British Grenadiers]]) honours the first three women to sit the [[Tripos|Tripos exams]]]]\nThe oldest college song, ''The Girton Pioneers'', was composed by several students in Hitchin in 1873.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> Its purpose was to celebrate the first three students who sat the Tripos examinations in 1871.<ref name=\"Jones 1913 p.28f\">Jones 1913 p.28f.</ref> It is sung with the tune of ''[[The British Grenadiers]]''. This is the first stanza:\n\n<blockquote><poem>Some talk of Senior Wranglers,\nAnd some of Double Firsts,\nAnd truly of their species\nThese are not the worst;\nBut of all the Cambridge heroes\nThere\u2019s none that can compare\nWith Woodhead, Cook and Lumsden,\nThe Girton Pioneers.<ref name=\"Jones 1913 p.28f\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\nMore recently, Girtonians have become known for their chant of ''We are Girton \u2013 super Girton! No one likes us, but we don't care''!, in imitation of the [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] fans' famous song: ''[[No one likes us, we don't care]]''. The reference to ''no one likes us'' is supposedly due to the relative distance of Girton in comparison to many of the other colleges. In 2016 the Casual Choir performed ''Long Way to Girton College'', an adaptation of ''[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]'', written and arranged by two choir members.\n\nThe college song ''I love to go a-bicycling'', sung with the tune of'' I love to go a-wandering'' also alludes to Girton's 2.5 miles distance from the town centre. It has been sung since the 1960s.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> For example, the second stanza reads:\n<blockquote><poem>But when I climb up Castle Hill\nIn the wind and squall\nA strong desire does then me fill\nTo be-e at [[Murray Edwards College, Cambridge|New Hall]].\n\n''Chorus:''\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra,\nFol-de-re, Fol-de-ra-a-a-a-\n.... To be-e at New Hall.<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\nAnother song, composed in 1972 by [[Common Room (university)|JCR]] president Anna Cocconi,<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/> is called ''Song to Wolfson Court''. The annexe of the college was opened in that year. Students often found fault with the modern architecture of the building, which was less spacious and elegant than the main site. The first two stanzas go as follows:\n<blockquote><poem> In a wheat field, west of Cambridge,\nOff a lane called Clarkson Road,\nWolfson Court is standing proudly;\nLet its story now be told\n\nHundred rooms with running water,\nCould you ever ask for more?\nNot unless you choose a boy-friend,\nMeas\u2019ring over five foot four!<ref name=\"College songs GC 2010\"/></poem></blockquote>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Girton College Boat Club]]\n* [[:Category:Alumni of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n* [[:Category:Fellows of Girton College, Cambridge]]\n\n===Eponymous institutions===\n*[[Girton Grammar School]], [[Bendigo, Victoria]], [[Australia]]\n*[[Girton Hall]], [[University of California, Berkeley]]\n\n===Official College Website===\n*[http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/ Girton College]\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n; Books\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite book |title=Life at Girton College |last=a Girton student |author-link= |year=1882 |publisher=(no publisher) |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url= |access-date=}}\n*{{cite book |title = 'That Infidel Place'.
