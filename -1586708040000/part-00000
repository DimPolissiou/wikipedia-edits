The mating is very brief with the male flapping his wings to maintain balance on top of the female.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n===Nesting===\nAbandoned buildings are favorite nesting areas. Mass nesting is common as pigeons are a community flocking bird; often, dozens of birds share a building. Loose tiles and broken windows provide access, and pigeons are adept at spotting new access points, for example following property damage caused by strong winds.\n\n[[File:few_hours_old_squab.ogg|thumb|left|Newly hatched squab on the base of a bathroom's ventilator window]]\nNests and droppings tend to stay clustered and remain dry when out of the weather. Pigeons are particularly fond of roof spaces. These often contain water tanks. Any water tank or cistern on a roof must, therefore, be secured and sealed off to keep the pigeons out of them. The popularity of a nesting area does not seem to be affected by the pigeons' population density.\n\n[[File:Portrait of Molting Feral Pigeon.jpg|thumb|right|Pigeon squab in nest]]\nOn undamaged property, the gutters, window [[air conditioners]] and empty air conditioner containers, chimney pots, and external ledges are used as nesting sites. Many building owners try to limit roosting by using [[bird control spike]]s and netting to cover ledges and potential nesting places on buildings. This has little effect on the size of the pigeon population, but it can reduce the accumulation of droppings on and around a particular building location.\n\nIn the UK, only the larger and more wary [[common wood pigeon]], which often shares the same territory and food supply, builds nests in trees, usually close to roads.\n\n===Cooing===\nIn Wendell Levi's ''The Pigeon'', he describes the crowing/cooing of pigeons as mostly being associated with strutting and fighting in male birds.<ref name=\"Levi\"/> Hens also coo, but this is noticeably less guttural than the cooing of the cock. Cooing is also more frequent between couples during mating and nesting.\n\nBoth parents participate in the incubation of the eggs.\n\n===Food===\n[[File:Rock Pigeon Columba livia 3264px.jpg|thumb|right|Perched in [[Central Park]]]]\nPigeons breed when the food supply is abundant enough to support embryonic egg development, which in cities, can be any time of the year. Laying of eggs can take place up to six times per year.\n\nPigeons are often found in pairs during the breeding season, but usually the pigeons are [[gregarious]], living in flocks of 50 to 500 birds (dependent on the food supply).<ref>{{cite book| last =Gibbs | first =David | authorlink = | first2 = Eustace | last2 = Barnes | first3 = John | last3 = Cox | title =Pigeons and Doves: A Guide to the Pigeons and Doves of the World | publisher =Pica Press | location =United Kingdom | page =624 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=aeZXAAAACAAJ&dq=Pigeons+and+Doves:+A+Guide+to+the+Pigeons+and+Doves+of+the+World\n| doi = | id = | isbn =978-1-873403-60-0 | year =2001 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Pigeons Eating.ogv|thumb|right|Video showing pigeons eating seeds]]\nFeral pigeons can be seen eating grass [[seed]]s and [[berries]] in parks and gardens in the spring, but plentiful sources exist throughout the year from scavenging (e.g., remnants left inside of dropped fast-food cartons) and they also take [[insect]]s and [[spider]]s.

When pigeons are poisoned, surviving birds do not leave the area. On the contrary, they are left with more food per bird than before.

Mass nesting is common as pigeons are a community flocking bird; often, dozens of birds share a building. Loose tiles and broken windows provide access, and pigeons are adept at spotting new access points, for example following property damage caused by strong winds.\n\n[[File:few_hours_old_squab.ogg|thumb|left|Newly hatched squab on the base of a bathroom's ventilator window]]\nNests and droppings tend to stay clustered and remain dry when out of the weather. Pigeons are particularly fond of roof spaces. These often contain water tanks. Any water tank or cistern on a roof must, therefore, be secured and sealed off to keep the pigeons out of them. The popularity of a nesting area does not seem to be affected by the pigeons' population density.\n\n[[File:Portrait of Molting Feral Pigeon.jpg|thumb|right|Pigeon squab in nest]]\nOn undamaged property, the gutters, window [[air conditioners]] and empty air conditioner containers, chimney pots, and external ledges are used as nesting sites. Many building owners try to limit roosting by using [[bird control spike]]s and netting to cover ledges and potential nesting places on buildings. This has little effect on the size of the pigeon population, but it can reduce the accumulation of droppings on and around a particular building location.\n\nIn the UK, only the larger and more wary [[common wood pigeon]], which often shares the same territory and food supply, builds nests in trees, usually close to roads.\n\n===Cooing===\nIn Wendell Levi's ''The Pigeon'', he describes the crowing/cooing of pigeons as mostly being associated with strutting and fighting in male birds.<ref name=\"Levi\"/> Hens also coo, but this is noticeably less guttural than the cooing of the cock. Cooing is also more frequent between couples during mating and nesting.\n\nBoth parents participate in the incubation of the eggs.\n\n===Food===\n[[File:Rock Pigeon Columba livia 3264px.jpg|thumb|right|Perched in [[Central Park]]]]\nPigeons breed when the food supply is abundant enough to support embryonic egg development, which in cities, can be any time of the year.

When pigeons are poisoned, surviving birds do not leave the area. On the contrary, they are left with more food per bird than before.

His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] era only to be [[Suppression of monasteries|suppressed]] in favor of the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]] during the [[Qin dynasty]]. Following the victory of [[Han dynasty|Han]] over [[Chu-Han Contention|Chu]] after the collapse of Qin, Confucius's thoughts received official sanction in the new government and were further developed into a system known in the West as [[Neo-Confucianism]], and later [[New Confucianism|New Confucianism (Modern Neo-Confucianism)]].\n\nConfucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the [[Chinese classics|Chinese classic texts]] including all of the [[Five Classics]], but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. [[Aphorism]]s concerning his teachings were compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', but only many years after his death.\n\nConfucius's principles have commonality with Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong family loyalty, [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]], and respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives, recommending family as a basis for ideal government. He espoused the well-known principle \"Do not do unto others what you do not want done to yourself\", the [[Golden Rule]]. He is also a traditional deity in [[Daoism]].\n\nConfucius is widely considered as one of the most important and influential individuals in shaping human history. His teaching and philosophy greatly impacted people around the world and remains influential today.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Life and Significance of Confucius|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/confucius.htm|website=www.sjsu.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=China Confucianism: Life of Confucius, Influences, Development|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/religion/confucianism/|website=www.travelchinaguide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\n{{anchor|Etymology|Name|Titles}}\nThe name \"Confucius\" is a [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] \"K\u01d2ng F\u016bz\u01d0\" ({{lang|zh|\u5b54\u592b\u5b50}}, meaning \"Master K\u01d2ng\"), and was coined in the late 16th century by the early [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries to China]].{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=752}} Confucius's clan name<!-- NOT surname, as they had not yet been invented--> was \"[[Kong (surname)|K\u01d2ng]]\" ({{lang|zh|\u5b54}}; [[Old Chinese]]: {{Old Chinese|[k]\u02b0\u02e4o\u014b\u0294}}), and his given name was \"Qi\u016b\" ({{lang|zh|\u4e18}}; OC: {{Old Chinese|[k]\u02b7\u02b0\u0259}}).

family\u2014rose up in rebellion and seized power from the Ji family.<ref name=dubs49-275>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275}}.</ref> However, by the summer of 501 BC, the three hereditary families had succeeded in expelling Yang Hu from Lu.<ref name=dubs49-275 /> By then, Confucius had built up a considerable reputation through his teachings, while the families came to see the value of proper conduct and righteousness, so they could achieve loyalty to a legitimate government.<ref name=dubs49-275-6>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275\u2013276}}.</ref> Thus, that year (501 BC), Confucius came to be appointed to the minor position of governor of a town.<ref name=dubs49-275-6 /> Eventually, he rose to the position of Minister of Crime.<ref name=dubs49-275-6 />\n\nConfucius desired to return the authority of the state to the duke by dismantling the fortifications of the city\u2014strongholds belonging to the three families.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> This way, he could establish a centralized government.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> However, Confucius relied solely on diplomacy as he had no military authority himself.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> In 500 BC, Hou Fan\u2014the governor of Hou\u2014revolted against his lord of the Shu family.<ref name=dubs49-277>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277}}.</ref> Although the Meng and Shu families unsuccessfully besieged Hou, a loyalist official rose up with the people of Hou and forced Hou Fan to flee to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]].<ref name=dubs49-277 /> The situation may have been in favor for Confucius as this likely made it possible for Confucius and his disciples to convince the aristocratic families to dismantle the fortifications of their cities.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> Eventually, after a year and a half, Confucius and his disciples succeeded in convincing the Shu family to raze the walls of Hou, the Ji family in razing the walls of Bi, and the Meng family in razing the walls of Cheng.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> First, the Shu family led an army towards their city Hou and tore down its walls in 498 BC.<ref name=dubs49-277 />\n\nSoon thereafter, Gongshan Furao (also known as Gongshan Buniu), a retainer of the Ji family, revolted and took control of the forces at Bi.<ref name=creel49-35-6>{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35\u201336}}.</ref><ref name=duuuu46-277-8 /> He immediately launched an attack and entered the capital Lu.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> Earlier, Gongshan had approached Confucius to join him, which Confucius considered as he wanted the opportunity to put his principles into practice but he gave up on the idea in the end.<ref name=creel49-35-6 /> Confucius disapproved the use of a violent revolution by principle, even though the Ji family dominated the Lu state by force for generations and had exiled the previous duke.<ref name=creel49-35-6 /> Creel (1949) states that, unlike the rebel Yang Hu before him, Gongshan may have sought to destroy the three hereditary families and restore the power of the duke.<ref name=creel49-35>{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35}}.</ref> However, Dubs (1946) is of the view that Gongshan was encouraged by Viscount Ji Huan to invade the Lu capital in an attempt to avoid dismantling the Bi fortified walls.<ref name=duuuu46-277-8>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277\u2013278}}.</ref> Whatever the situation may have been, Gongshan was considered an upright man who continued to defend the state of Lu, even after he was forced to flee.<ref name=creel49-35 /><ref name=dubs49-278 />\n\nDuring the revolt by Gongshan, [[Zhong You]] had managed to keep the duke and the three viscounts together at the court.<ref name=dubs49-278>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278}}.</ref> Zhong You was one of the disciples of Confucius and Confucius had arranged for him to be given the position of governor by the Ji family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278\u2013279}}.</ref> When Confucius heard of the raid, he requested that Viscount Ji Huan allow the duke and his court to retreat to a stronghold on his palace grounds.<ref name=dubs49-279>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=279}}.</ref> Thereafter, the heads of the three families and the duke retreated to the Ji's palace complex and ascended the Wuzi Terrace.<ref name=chin07-30>{{Harvnb|Chin|2007|loc=30}}.</ref> Confucius ordered two officers to lead an assault against the rebels.<ref name=chin07-30 /> At least one of the two officers was a retainer of the Ji family, but they were unable to refuse the orders while in the presence of the duke, viscounts, and court.<ref name=dubs49-279 /> The rebels were pursued and defeated at Gu.<ref name=chin07-30 /> Immediately after the revolt was defeated, the Ji family razed the Bi city walls to the ground.<ref name=chin07-30 />\n\nThe attackers retreated after realizing that they would have to become rebels against the state and their lord.<ref name=dubs49-279 /> Through Confucius' actions, the Bi officials had inadvertently revolted against their own lord, thus forcing Viscount Ji Huan's hand in having to dismantle the walls of Bi (as it could have harbored such rebels) or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official.<ref name=dubs49-279 /> Dubs (1949) suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius' foresight, practical political ability, and insight into human character.<ref name=dubs49-279 />\n\nWhen it was time to dismantle the city walls of the Meng family, the governor was reluctant to have his city walls torn down and convinced the head of the Meng family not to do so.<ref name=chin07-30 /> The ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' recalls that the governor advised against razing the walls to the ground as he said that it made Cheng vulnerable to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] and cause the destruction of the Meng family.<ref name=\"dubs49-279\" /> Even though Viscount Meng Yi gave his word not to interfere with an attempt, he went back on his earlier promise to dismantle the walls.<ref name=\"dubs49-279\" />\n\nLater in 498 BC, Duke Ding personally went with an army to lay siege to Cheng in an attempt to raze its walls to the ground, but he did not succeed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280}}.</ref> Thus, Confucius could not achieve the idealistic reforms that he wanted including restoration of the legitimate rule of the duke.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280\u2013281}}.</ref> He had made powerful enemies within the state, especially with Viscount Ji Huan, due to his successes so far.<ref name=dubs46-281>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=281}}.</ref> According to accounts in the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' and ''[[Shiji]]'', Confucius departed his homeland in 497 BC after his support for the failed attempt of dismantling the fortified city walls of the powerful Ji, Meng, and Shu families.<ref>{{Harvnb|Riegel|1986|loc=13}}.</ref> He left the state of Lu without resigning, remaining in self-exile and unable to return as long as Viscount Ji Huan was alive.<ref name=dubs46-281 />\n\n===Exile===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Journey of Confucius.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the journey of Confucius to various states between 497 BC and 484 BC.]]\nThe ''[[Shiji]]'' stated that the neighboring [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] was worried that Lu was becoming too powerful while Confucius was involved in the government of the Lu state. According to this account, Qi decided to sabotage Lu's reforms by sending 100 good horses and 80 beautiful dancing girls to the duke of Lu. The duke indulged himself in pleasure and did not attend to official duties for three days. Confucius was disappointed and resolved to leave Lu and seek better opportunities, yet to leave at once would expose the misbehavior of the duke and therefore bring public humiliation to the ruler Confucius was serving. Confucius therefore waited for the duke to make a lesser mistake. Soon after, the duke neglected to send to Confucius a portion of the sacrificial meat that was his due according to custom, and Confucius seized upon this pretext to leave both his post and the Lu state.\n\nAfter Confucius's resignation, he began a long journey or set of journeys around the [[ancient Chinese states|principality states]] of north-east and central China including [[Wei (Spring and Autumn Period)|Wey]], [[Song (state)|Song]], [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], [[Cao (state)|Cao]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], [[Chen (state)|Chen]], and [[Cai (state)|Cai]] (and a failed attempt to go to [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]]). At the courts of these states, he expounded his political beliefs but did not see them implemented.\n\n===Return home===\n[[File:Confuciustombqufu.jpg|thumb|200px|Tomb of Confucius in [[Cemetery of Confucius|Kong Lin cemetery]], [[Qufu]], [[Shandong Province]]]]\n\nAccording to the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'', Confucius returned home to his native Lu when he was 68, after he was invited to do so by Ji Kangzi, the chief minister of Lu.<ref name=return>{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yong|title=Confucius: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2013|publisher=A&C Black|pages=27\u201328|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=confucius+return+68+lu#v=onepage&q=confucius%20return%2068%20lu&f=false|accessdate=August 13, 2015|isbn=978-1-4411-9653-8}}</ref> The ''Analects'' depict him spending his last years teaching 72 or 77 [[disciples of Confucius|disciples]] and transmitting the old wisdom via a set of texts called the [[Five Classics]].\n\nDuring his return, Confucius sometimes acted as an advisor to several government officials in Lu, including Ji Kangzi, on matters including governance and crime.<ref name=return/>\n\nBurdened by the loss of both his son and his favorite disciples, he died at the age of 71 or 72. He died from natural causes.

Proponents argue, however, that despite the secular nature of Confucianism's teachings, it is based on a worldview that is religious.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Berger|first=Peter|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|title=Is Confucianism a Religion?|magazine=The American Interest|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817062142/http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|archivedate=August 17, 2015}}</ref> Confucianism discusses elements of the [[Diyu|afterlife]] and views concerning [[Tian|Heaven]], but it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought, such as the nature of [[Chinese soul|souls]]. However, Confucius is said to have believed in astrology, saying: \"Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly\".<ref name=\"Parkers\">[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Rongo Analects 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Analects]] of Confucius]]\n\nIn the ''[[Analects]]'', Confucius presents himself as a \"transmitter who invented nothing\". He puts the greatest emphasis on the importance of study, and it is the [[Chinese character]] for study ({{linktext|\u5b78}}) that opens the text. Far from trying to build a systematic or [[Religious formalism|formalist]] theory, he wanted his disciples to master and internalize older classics, so that their deep thought and thorough study would allow them to relate the moral problems of the present to past political events (as recorded in the ''Annals'') or the past expressions of commoners' feelings and noblemen's reflections (as in the poems of the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Odes]]'').\n\n===Ethics===\nOne of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules. Confucian ethics may, therefore, be considered a type of [[virtue ethics]]. His teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument, and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed indirectly, through [[allusion]], [[innuendo]], and even [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]. His teachings require examination and context to be understood. A good example is found in this famous anecdote:\n\n::{{lang|zh|\u5ec4\u711a\u3002\u5b50\u9000\u671d\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u50b7\u4eba\u4e4e\uff1f\u201d \u4e0d\u554f\u99ac\u3002}}\n::''When the stables were burnt down, on returning from court Confucius said, \"Was anyone hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses.''\n:::::::''Analects'' X.11 (tr. [[Arthur Waley|Waley]]), 10\u201313 (tr. [[James Legge|Legge]]), or X-17 (tr. [[D.C. Lau|Lau]])\n\nBy not asking about the horses, Confucius demonstrates that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of [[humanism]].\n\nOne of his teachings was a variant of the [[Golden Rule]], sometimes called the \"[[Silver Rule]]\" owing to its negative form:\n\n::{{lang|zh|\u5df1\u6240\u4e0d\u6b32\uff0c\u52ff\u65bd\u65bc\u4eba\u3002}}\n::''\"What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.\"''\n\n::{{lang|zh|\u5b50\u8ca2\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u6709\u4e00\u8a00\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7d42\u8eab\u884c\u4e4b\u8005\u4e4e\uff1f\u201d\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u5176\u6055\u4e4e\uff01\u5df1\u6240\u4e0d\u6b32\u3001\u52ff\u65bd\u65bc\u4eba\u3002\u201d}}\n::''Zi Gong [a disciple] asked: \"Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?\" <br />The Master replied: \"How about 'reciprocity'! Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself.\"''\n:::::::''Analects'' XV.24, tr. David Hinton\n\nOften overlooked in Confucian ethics are the virtues to the self: sincerity and the cultivation of knowledge. Virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought, which begins with knowledge. A virtuous disposition without knowledge is susceptible to corruption, and virtuous action without sincerity is not true righteousness. Cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for one's own sake; the superior person loves learning for the sake of learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness.\n\nThe Confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in ''[[Li (Confucian)|l\u01d0]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u79ae}}) is based on three important conceptual aspects of life: (a) ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types, (b) social and political institutions, and (c) the etiquette of daily behavior. It was believed by some that ''l\u01d0'' originated from the heavens, but Confucius stressed the development of ''l\u01d0'' through the actions of sage leaders in human history. His discussions of ''l\u01d0'' seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society, rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony.\n\nIn the early Confucian tradition, ''l\u01d0'' was doing the proper thing at the proper time, balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric, and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good. Training in the ''l\u01d0'' of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when ''l\u01d0'' must be adapted in light of situational contexts.\n\nIn Confucianism, the concept of ''li'' is closely related to ''y\u00ec'' ({{lang|zh|\u7fa9}}), which is based upon the idea of reciprocity. ''Y\u00ec'' can be translated as [[righteousness]], though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context. The term contrasts with action done out of [[selfishness|self-interest]]. While pursuing one's own self-interest is not necessarily bad, one would be a better, more righteous person if one's life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good. Thus an outcome of ''y\u00ec'' is doing the right thing for the right reason.\n\nJust as action according to ''[[Li (Confucian)|l\u01d0]]'' should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to ''y\u00ec'', so ''y\u00ec'' is linked to the core value of ''r\u00e9n'' ({{lang|zh|\u4ec1}}).''[[Ren (Confucianism)|R\u00e9n]]'' consists of five basic virtues: seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence and kindness.<ref name=\"Bonevac09-40\">{{Harvnb|Bonevac|Phillips|2009|loc=40}}.</ref> ''R\u00e9n'' is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others, most often translated as \"benevolence\" or \"humaneness\"; translator [[Arthur Waley]] calls it \"Goodness\" (with a capital ''G''), and other translations that have been put forth include \"authoritativeness\" and \"selflessness.\" Confucius's moral system was based upon [[empathy]] and understanding others, rather than divinely ordained rules. To develop one's spontaneous responses of ''r\u00e9n'' so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of ''y\u00ec''. Confucius asserts that virtue is a mean between extremes. For example, the properly generous person gives the right amount\u2014not too much and not too little.<ref name=\"Bonevac09-40\" />\n\n===Politics===\nConfucius's political thought is based upon his ethical thought. He argued that the best government is one that rules through \"rites\" (''l\u01d0'') and people's [[natural morality]], and ''not'' by using bribery and coercion. He explained that this is one of the most important analects: \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good.\" (Translated by [[James Legge]]) in the [[Great Learning]] ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u5b78}}). This \"sense of shame\" is an internalisation of [[duty]], where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].\n\nConfucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days, and urged the Chinese, particularly those with political power, to model themselves on earlier examples. In times of division, chaos, and endless wars between feudal states, he wanted to restore the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u547d}}) that could unify the \"world\" ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u4e0b}}, \"all under Heaven\") and bestow peace and prosperity on the people. Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times, Confucius is often considered a great proponent of [[conservatism]], but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used (and perhaps twisted) past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own: a revival of a unified royal state, whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage. These would be rulers devoted to their people, striving for personal and social [[perfection]], and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules.\n\nConfucius did not believe in the concept of \"[[democracy]]\", which is itself an [[Athens|Athenian]] concept unknown in ancient China, but could be interpreted by Confucius's principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them, or that anyone is capable of self-government. He expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves, and that, in his view, since not everyone is created equal, not everyone has a right of self-government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schuman|first1=Michael|title=Confucius: And the World He Created|date=2015|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wb6DBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT123&lpg=PT123&dq=confucius+everyone+equal#v=onepage&q=confucius%20everyone%20equal&f=false|isbn =978-0-465-04057-5|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile he supported the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing [[truth]] in language, and [[honesty]] was of paramount importance. Even in [[facial expression]], truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing the relationship between a king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Violatti|first=Cristian|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|title=Confucianism|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818150049/http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|archivedate=August 18, 2015|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}\nConfucius's teachings were later turned into an elaborate set of rules and practices by his numerous disciples and followers, who organized his teachings into the Analects.{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shih|2010|p=645}}{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|p=25}} Confucius's disciples and his only grandson, [[Zisi]], continued his philosophical school after his death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Focusing the Familiar: A Translation and Philosophical Interpretation of the Zhongyong|author=Ames, Roger T. and David L.

In the centuries after his death, [[Mencius]] ({{lang|zh|\u5b5f\u5b50}}) and [[Xun Zi]] ({{lang|zh|\u8340\u5b50}}) both composed important teachings elaborating in different ways on the fundamental ideas associated with Confucius. [[Mencius]] (4th century BC) articulated the innate goodness in human beings as a source of the ethical intuitions that guide people towards ''r\u00e9n'', ''y\u00ec'', and ''l\u01d0'', while [[Xun Zi]] (3rd century BC) underscored the realistic and materialistic aspects of Confucian thought, stressing that morality was inculcated in society through tradition and in individuals through training. In time, their writings, together with the ''Analects'' and other core texts came to constitute the philosophical corpus of Confucianism.\n\nThis realignment in Confucian thought was parallel to the development of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which saw filial piety as self-interest and not a useful tool for a ruler to create an effective state. A disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 BC when the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] conquered all of China. [[Li Si]], Prime Minister of the [[Qin dynasty]], convinced [[Qin Shi Huang]] to abandon the Confucians' recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] before them which he saw as being against to the Legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler. When the Confucian advisers pressed their point, Li Si had many Confucian scholars killed and their books burned\u2014considered a huge blow to the philosophy and Chinese scholarship.\n\nUnder the succeeding [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. Under [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]], the works of Confucius were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil service examinations in 140 BC which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th century. As [[Mohism]] lost support by the time of the Han,  the main philosophical contenders were Legalism, which Confucian thought somewhat absorbed, the teachings of [[Laozi]], whose focus on more spiritual ideas kept it from direct conflict with Confucianism, and the new [[Buddhist]] religion, which gained acceptance during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era. Both Confucian ideas and Confucian-trained officials were relied upon in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and even the [[Yuan Dynasty]], although Kublai Khan distrusted handing over provincial control to them.\n\nDuring the [[Song dynasty]], the scholar [[Zhu Xi]] (AD 1130\u20131200) added ideas from [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death, his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different and call his way of thinking ''[[Neo-Confucianism]]''.

His disciples and the early Confucian community they formed became the most influential intellectual force in the [[Warring States period]].{{sfnp|Shen|2013|p=86}} The [[Han dynasty]] historian [[Sima Qian]] dedicated a chapter in his ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' to the biographies of Confucius's disciples, accounting for the influence they exerted in their time and afterward.

Carvings often depict his legendary meeting with [[Laozi]]. Since that time there have been many portraits of Confucius as the ideal philosopher. The oldest known portrait of Confucius has been unearthed in the tomb of the [[Han dynasty]] ruler [[Marquis of Haihun]] (died 59 BC). The picture was painted on the wooden frame to a polished bronze mirror.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0221/57185.html |title=Confucius depicted on mirror |date= |language=English |website=The Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences |accessdate=22 February 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170222200723/http://www.kaogu.cn/en/News/New_discoveries/2017/0221/57185.html |archivedate=22 February 2017 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn former times, it was customary to have a portrait in [[Temple of Confucius|Confucius Temples]]; however, during the reign of [[Hongwu Emperor]] (Taizu) of the [[Ming dynasty]], it was decided that the only proper portrait of Confucius should be in the [[Temple of Confucius, Qufu|temple]] in his home town, [[Qufu]] in Shandong. In other temples, Confucius is represented by a memorial tablet. In 2006, the China Confucius Foundation commissioned a standard portrait of Confucius based on the [[Tang dynasty]] portrait by [[Wu Daozi]].\n\nThe South Wall [[Frieze]] in the courtroom of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] depicts Confucius as a teacher of harmony, learning, and virtue.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/northandsouthwalls.pdf|title=US Supreme Court Courtroom Friezes|accessdate=19 February 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Fictional portrayals===\nThere have been two film adaptations of Confucius' life: [[Confucius (1940 film)|''Confucius'' (1940)]] starring Tang Huaiqiu, and [[Confucius (2010 film)|''Confucius'' (2010)]] starring [[Chow Yun-fat]].\n\nIn music, [[Tori Amos]] imagines Confucius as working on a [[crossword puzzle]] in her [[1992]] song \"Happy Phantom.\"\n\n===Memorials===\n[[File:First Entrance Gate of the Temple of Confucius, Ching-hai.jpg|thumb|left|First entrance gate of the [[Temple of Confucius]] in [[Zhenhai]]]]\n\nSoon after Confucius's death, [[Qufu]], his home town, became a place of devotion and remembrance. The [[Han dynasty]] ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' records that it had already become a place of pilgrimage for ministers. It is still a major destination for cultural tourism, and many people visit his grave and the surrounding temples. In Sinic cultures, there are many temples where representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Laozi]], and Confucius are found together. There are also many [[Temple of Confucius|temples]] dedicated to him, which have been used for Confucian ceremonies.\n\nFollowers of Confucianism have a tradition of holding spectacular memorial ceremonies of Confucius ({{lang|zh|\u796d\u5b54}}) every year, using ceremonies that supposedly derived from Zhou Li ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u79ae}}) as recorded by Confucius, on the date of Confucius's birth. In the 20th century, this tradition was interrupted for several decades in mainland China, where the official stance of the Communist Party and the State was that Confucius and Confucianism represented reactionary [[Feudalism|feudalist]] beliefs which held that the subservience of the people to the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] is a part of the natural order. All such ceremonies and rites were therefore banned. Only after the 1990s did the ceremony resume. As it is now considered a veneration of Chinese history and tradition, even Communist Party members may be found in attendance.\n\nIn Taiwan, where the Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) strongly promoted Confucian beliefs in ethics and behavior, the tradition of the memorial ceremony of Confucius (\u796d\u5b54) is supported by the government and has continued without interruption. While not a national holiday, it does appear on all printed calendars, much as [[Father's Day]] or [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] do in the Western world.\n\nIn [[South Korea]], a grand-scale memorial ceremony called [[Seokjeon Daeje]] is held twice a year on Confucius's birthday and the anniversary of his death, at [[Hyanggyo|Confucian academies]] across the country and [[Sungkyunkwan]] in Seoul.\n\n===Descendants===\n{{See also|Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent}}\n\nConfucius's descendants were repeatedly identified and honored by successive imperial governments with titles of nobility and official posts. They were honored with the rank of a [[marquess|marquis]] 35 times since [[Gaozu of Han|Gaozu]] of the [[Han dynasty]], and they were promoted to the rank of [[duke]] 42 times from the [[Tang dynasty]] to the [[Qing dynasty]]. [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] first bestowed the title of \"Duke Wenxuan\" on Kong Suizhi of the 35th generation. In 1055, [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] first bestowed the title of \"[[Duke Yansheng]]\" on Kong Zongyuan of the 46th generation.\n\nDuring the [[Southern Song dynasty]], the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to [[Quzhou]] in Zhejiang, while the newly established [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)]] in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/hotnews/9910seminar/download/en/B10.pdf |title=Descendants and Portraits of Confucius in the Early Southern Song  |accessdate=2016-05-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913134503/http://www.npm.gov.tw/hotnews/9910seminar/download/en/B10.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-13 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aas2.asian-studies.org/absts/1995abst/china/csess45.htm |title=AAS Abstracts: China Session 45 |first=B.

His followers competed successfully with many other schools during the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] era only to be [[Suppression of monasteries|suppressed]] in favor of the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]] during the [[Qin dynasty]]. Following the victory of [[Han dynasty|Han]] over [[Chu-Han Contention|Chu]] after the collapse of Qin, Confucius's thoughts received official sanction in the new government and were further developed into a system known in the West as [[Neo-Confucianism]], and later [[New Confucianism|New Confucianism (Modern Neo-Confucianism)]].\n\nConfucius is traditionally credited with having authored or edited many of the [[Chinese classics|Chinese classic texts]] including all of the [[Five Classics]], but modern scholars are cautious of attributing specific assertions to Confucius himself. [[Aphorism]]s concerning his teachings were compiled in the ''[[Analects]]'', but only many years after his death.\n\nConfucius's principles have commonality with Chinese tradition and belief. He championed strong family loyalty, [[Ancestor veneration in China|ancestor veneration]], and respect of elders by their children and of husbands by their wives, recommending family as a basis for ideal government. He espoused the well-known principle \"Do not do unto others what you do not want done to yourself\", the [[Golden Rule]]. He is also a traditional deity in [[Daoism]].\n\nConfucius is widely considered as one of the most important and influential individuals in shaping human history. His teaching and philosophy greatly impacted people around the world and remains influential today.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Life and Significance of Confucius|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/confucius.htm|website=www.sjsu.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=China Confucianism: Life of Confucius, Influences, Development|url=https://www.travelchinaguide.com/intro/religion/confucianism/|website=www.travelchinaguide.com}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\n{{anchor|Etymology|Name|Titles}}\nThe name \"Confucius\" is a [[Latin]]ized form of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] \"K\u01d2ng F\u016bz\u01d0\" ({{lang|zh|\u5b54\u592b\u5b50}}, meaning \"Master K\u01d2ng\"), and was coined in the late 16th century by the early [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries to China]].{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=752}} Confucius's clan name<!-- NOT surname, as they had not yet been invented--> was \"[[Kong (surname)|K\u01d2ng]]\" ({{lang|zh|\u5b54}}; [[Old Chinese]]: {{Old Chinese|[k]\u02b0\u02e4o\u014b\u0294}}), and his given name was \"Qi\u016b\" ({{lang|zh|\u4e18}}; OC: {{Old Chinese|[k]\u02b7\u02b0\u0259}}).

state of [[Lu (state)|Lu]] was headed by a ruling ducal house.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=274\u2013275}}.</ref> Under the duke were [[Three Huan|three aristocratic families]], whose heads bore the title of viscount and held hereditary positions in the Lu bureaucracy.<ref name=dubs49-275 /> The Ji family held the position \"Minister over the Masses\", who was also the \"Prime Minister\"; the Meng family held the position \"Minister of Works\"; and the Shu family held the position \"Minister of War\".<ref name=dubs49-275 /> In the winter of 505 BC, Yang Hu\u2014a retainer of the Ji family\u2014rose up in rebellion and seized power from the Ji family.<ref name=dubs49-275>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275}}.</ref> However, by the summer of 501 BC, the three hereditary families had succeeded in expelling Yang Hu from Lu.<ref name=dubs49-275 /> By then, Confucius had built up a considerable reputation through his teachings, while the families came to see the value of proper conduct and righteousness, so they could achieve loyalty to a legitimate government.<ref name=dubs49-275-6>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=275\u2013276}}.</ref> Thus, that year (501 BC), Confucius came to be appointed to the minor position of governor of a town.<ref name=dubs49-275-6 /> Eventually, he rose to the position of Minister of Crime.<ref name=dubs49-275-6 />\n\nConfucius desired to return the authority of the state to the duke by dismantling the fortifications of the city\u2014strongholds belonging to the three families.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> This way, he could establish a centralized government.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> However, Confucius relied solely on diplomacy as he had no military authority himself.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> In 500 BC, Hou Fan\u2014the governor of Hou\u2014revolted against his lord of the Shu family.<ref name=dubs49-277>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277}}.</ref> Although the Meng and Shu families unsuccessfully besieged Hou, a loyalist official rose up with the people of Hou and forced Hou Fan to flee to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]].<ref name=dubs49-277 /> The situation may have been in favor for Confucius as this likely made it possible for Confucius and his disciples to convince the aristocratic families to dismantle the fortifications of their cities.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> Eventually, after a year and a half, Confucius and his disciples succeeded in convincing the Shu family to raze the walls of Hou, the Ji family in razing the walls of Bi, and the Meng family in razing the walls of Cheng.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> First, the Shu family led an army towards their city Hou and tore down its walls in 498 BC.<ref name=dubs49-277 />\n\nSoon thereafter, Gongshan Furao (also known as Gongshan Buniu), a retainer of the Ji family, revolted and took control of the forces at Bi.<ref name=creel49-35-6>{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35\u201336}}.</ref><ref name=duuuu46-277-8 /> He immediately launched an attack and entered the capital Lu.<ref name=dubs49-277 /> Earlier, Gongshan had approached Confucius to join him, which Confucius considered as he wanted the opportunity to put his principles into practice but he gave up on the idea in the end.<ref name=creel49-35-6 /> Confucius disapproved the use of a violent revolution by principle, even though the Ji family dominated the Lu state by force for generations and had exiled the previous duke.<ref name=creel49-35-6 /> Creel (1949) states that, unlike the rebel Yang Hu before him, Gongshan may have sought to destroy the three hereditary families and restore the power of the duke.<ref name=creel49-35>{{Harvnb|Creel|1949|loc=35}}.</ref> However, Dubs (1946) is of the view that Gongshan was encouraged by Viscount Ji Huan to invade the Lu capital in an attempt to avoid dismantling the Bi fortified walls.<ref name=duuuu46-277-8>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=277\u2013278}}.</ref> Whatever the situation may have been, Gongshan was considered an upright man who continued to defend the state of Lu, even after he was forced to flee.<ref name=creel49-35 /><ref name=dubs49-278 />\n\nDuring the revolt by Gongshan, [[Zhong You]] had managed to keep the duke and the three viscounts together at the court.<ref name=dubs49-278>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278}}.</ref> Zhong You was one of the disciples of Confucius and Confucius had arranged for him to be given the position of governor by the Ji family.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=278\u2013279}}.</ref> When Confucius heard of the raid, he requested that Viscount Ji Huan allow the duke and his court to retreat to a stronghold on his palace grounds.<ref name=dubs49-279>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=279}}.</ref> Thereafter, the heads of the three families and the duke retreated to the Ji's palace complex and ascended the Wuzi Terrace.<ref name=chin07-30>{{Harvnb|Chin|2007|loc=30}}.</ref> Confucius ordered two officers to lead an assault against the rebels.<ref name=chin07-30 /> At least one of the two officers was a retainer of the Ji family, but they were unable to refuse the orders while in the presence of the duke, viscounts, and court.<ref name=dubs49-279 /> The rebels were pursued and defeated at Gu.<ref name=chin07-30 /> Immediately after the revolt was defeated, the Ji family razed the Bi city walls to the ground.<ref name=chin07-30 />\n\nThe attackers retreated after realizing that they would have to become rebels against the state and their lord.<ref name=dubs49-279 /> Through Confucius' actions, the Bi officials had inadvertently revolted against their own lord, thus forcing Viscount Ji Huan's hand in having to dismantle the walls of Bi (as it could have harbored such rebels) or confess to instigating the event by going against proper conduct and righteousness as an official.<ref name=dubs49-279 /> Dubs (1949) suggests that the incident brought to light Confucius' foresight, practical political ability, and insight into human character.<ref name=dubs49-279 />\n\nWhen it was time to dismantle the city walls of the Meng family, the governor was reluctant to have his city walls torn down and convinced the head of the Meng family not to do so.<ref name=chin07-30 /> The ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' recalls that the governor advised against razing the walls to the ground as he said that it made Cheng vulnerable to the [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] and cause the destruction of the Meng family.<ref name=\"dubs49-279\" /> Even though Viscount Meng Yi gave his word not to interfere with an attempt, he went back on his earlier promise to dismantle the walls.<ref name=\"dubs49-279\" />\n\nLater in 498 BC, Duke Ding personally went with an army to lay siege to Cheng in an attempt to raze its walls to the ground, but he did not succeed.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280}}.</ref> Thus, Confucius could not achieve the idealistic reforms that he wanted including restoration of the legitimate rule of the duke.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=280\u2013281}}.</ref> He had made powerful enemies within the state, especially with Viscount Ji Huan, due to his successes so far.<ref name=dubs46-281>{{Harvnb|Dubs|1946|loc=281}}.</ref> According to accounts in the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'' and ''[[Shiji]]'', Confucius departed his homeland in 497 BC after his support for the failed attempt of dismantling the fortified city walls of the powerful Ji, Meng, and Shu families.<ref>{{Harvnb|Riegel|1986|loc=13}}.</ref> He left the state of Lu without resigning, remaining in self-exile and unable to return as long as Viscount Ji Huan was alive.<ref name=dubs46-281 />\n\n===Exile===\n{{unreferenced section|date=September 2017}}\n[[File:Journey of Confucius.png|thumb|450px|Map showing the journey of Confucius to various states between 497 BC and 484 BC.]]\nThe ''[[Shiji]]'' stated that the neighboring [[Qi (state)|Qi state]] was worried that Lu was becoming too powerful while Confucius was involved in the government of the Lu state. According to this account, Qi decided to sabotage Lu's reforms by sending 100 good horses and 80 beautiful dancing girls to the duke of Lu. The duke indulged himself in pleasure and did not attend to official duties for three days. Confucius was disappointed and resolved to leave Lu and seek better opportunities, yet to leave at once would expose the misbehavior of the duke and therefore bring public humiliation to the ruler Confucius was serving. Confucius therefore waited for the duke to make a lesser mistake. Soon after, the duke neglected to send to Confucius a portion of the sacrificial meat that was his due according to custom, and Confucius seized upon this pretext to leave both his post and the Lu state.\n\nAfter Confucius's resignation, he began a long journey or set of journeys around the [[ancient Chinese states|principality states]] of north-east and central China including [[Wei (Spring and Autumn Period)|Wey]], [[Song (state)|Song]], [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], [[Cao (state)|Cao]], [[Chu (state)|Chu]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]], [[Chen (state)|Chen]], and [[Cai (state)|Cai]] (and a failed attempt to go to [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]]). At the courts of these states, he expounded his political beliefs but did not see them implemented.\n\n===Return home===\n[[File:Confuciustombqufu.jpg|thumb|200px|Tomb of Confucius in [[Cemetery of Confucius|Kong Lin cemetery]], [[Qufu]], [[Shandong Province]]]]\n\nAccording to the ''[[Zuozhuan]]'', Confucius returned home to his native Lu when he was 68, after he was invited to do so by Ji Kangzi, the chief minister of Lu.<ref name=return>{{cite book|last1=Huang|first1=Yong|title=Confucius: A Guide for the Perplexed|date=2013|publisher=A&C Black|pages=27\u201328|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1R9MAQAAQBAJ&pg=PA28&lpg=PA28&dq=confucius+return+68+lu#v=onepage&q=confucius%20return%2068%20lu&f=false|accessdate=August 13, 2015|isbn=978-1-4411-9653-8}}</ref> The ''Analects'' depict him spending his last years teaching 72 or 77 [[disciples of Confucius|disciples]] and transmitting the old wisdom via a set of texts called the [[Five Classics]].\n\nDuring his return, Confucius sometimes acted as an advisor to several government officials in Lu, including Ji Kangzi, on matters including governance and crime.<ref name=return/>\n\nBurdened by the loss of both his son and his favorite disciples, he died at the age of 71 or 72.

Proponents argue, however, that despite the secular nature of Confucianism's teachings, it is based on a worldview that is religious.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Berger|first=Peter|url=http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|title=Is Confucianism a Religion?|magazine=The American Interest|date=February 15, 2012|accessdate=August 13, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817062142/http://www.the-american-interest.com/2012/02/15/is-confucianism-a-religion/|archivedate=August 17, 2015}}</ref> Confucianism discusses elements of the [[Diyu|afterlife]] and views concerning [[Tian|Heaven]], but it is relatively unconcerned with some spiritual matters often considered essential to religious thought, such as the nature of [[Chinese soul|souls]]. However, Confucius is said to have believed in astrology, saying: \"Heaven sends down its good or evil symbols and wise men act accordingly\".<ref name=\"Parkers\">[[#Reference-Parkers|Parkers (1983)]]</ref>\n\n[[File:Rongo Analects 02.jpg|thumb|The [[Analects]] of Confucius]]\n\nIn the ''[[Analects]]'', Confucius presents himself as a \"transmitter who invented nothing\". He puts the greatest emphasis on the importance of study, and it is the [[Chinese character]] for study ({{linktext|\u5b78}}) that opens the text. Far from trying to build a systematic or [[Religious formalism|formalist]] theory, he wanted his disciples to master and internalize older classics, so that their deep thought and thorough study would allow them to relate the moral problems of the present to past political events (as recorded in the ''Annals'') or the past expressions of commoners' feelings and noblemen's reflections (as in the poems of the ''[[Shi Jing|Book of Odes]]'').\n\n===Ethics===\nOne of the deepest teachings of Confucius may have been the superiority of personal exemplification over explicit rules of behavior. His moral teachings emphasized self-cultivation, emulation of moral exemplars, and the attainment of skilled judgment rather than knowledge of rules. Confucian ethics may, therefore, be considered a type of [[virtue ethics]]. His teachings rarely rely on reasoned argument, and ethical ideals and methods are conveyed indirectly, through [[allusion]], [[innuendo]], and even [[tautology (rhetoric)|tautology]]. His teachings require examination and context to be understood. A good example is found in this famous anecdote:\n\n::{{lang|zh|\u5ec4\u711a\u3002\u5b50\u9000\u671d\uff0c\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u50b7\u4eba\u4e4e\uff1f\u201d \u4e0d\u554f\u99ac\u3002}}\n::''When the stables were burnt down, on returning from court Confucius said, \"Was anyone hurt?\" He did not ask about the horses.''\n:::::::''Analects'' X.11 (tr. [[Arthur Waley|Waley]]), 10\u201313 (tr. [[James Legge|Legge]]), or X-17 (tr. [[D.C. Lau|Lau]])\n\nBy not asking about the horses, Confucius demonstrates that the sage values human beings over property; readers are led to reflect on whether their response would follow Confucius's and to pursue self-improvement if it would not have. Confucius serves not as an all-powerful deity or a universally true set of abstract principles, but rather the ultimate model for others. For these reasons, according to many commentators, Confucius's teachings may be considered a Chinese example of [[humanism]].\n\nOne of his teachings was a variant of the [[Golden Rule]], sometimes called the \"[[Silver Rule]]\" owing to its negative form:\n\n::{{lang|zh|\u5df1\u6240\u4e0d\u6b32\uff0c\u52ff\u65bd\u65bc\u4eba\u3002}}\n::''\"What you do not wish for yourself, do not do to others.\"''\n\n::{{lang|zh|\u5b50\u8ca2\u554f\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u6709\u4e00\u8a00\u800c\u53ef\u4ee5\u7d42\u8eab\u884c\u4e4b\u8005\u4e4e\uff1f\u201d\u5b50\u66f0\uff1a\u201c\u5176\u6055\u4e4e\uff01\u5df1\u6240\u4e0d\u6b32\u3001\u52ff\u65bd\u65bc\u4eba\u3002\u201d}}\n::''Zi Gong [a disciple] asked: \"Is there any one word that could guide a person throughout life?\" <br />The Master replied: \"How about 'reciprocity'! Never impose on others what you would not choose for yourself.\"''\n:::::::''Analects'' XV.24, tr. David Hinton\n\nOften overlooked in Confucian ethics are the virtues to the self: sincerity and the cultivation of knowledge. Virtuous action towards others begins with virtuous and sincere thought, which begins with knowledge. A virtuous disposition without knowledge is susceptible to corruption, and virtuous action without sincerity is not true righteousness. Cultivating knowledge and sincerity is also important for one's own sake; the superior person loves learning for the sake of learning and righteousness for the sake of righteousness.\n\nThe Confucian theory of ethics as exemplified in ''[[Li (Confucian)|l\u01d0]]'' ({{lang|zh|\u79ae}}) is based on three important conceptual aspects of life: (a) ceremonies associated with sacrifice to ancestors and deities of various types, (b) social and political institutions, and (c) the etiquette of daily behavior. It was believed by some that ''l\u01d0'' originated from the heavens, but Confucius stressed the development of ''l\u01d0'' through the actions of sage leaders in human history. His discussions of ''l\u01d0'' seem to redefine the term to refer to all actions committed by a person to build the ideal society, rather than those simply conforming with canonical standards of ceremony.\n\nIn the early Confucian tradition, ''l\u01d0'' was doing the proper thing at the proper time, balancing between maintaining existing norms to perpetuate an ethical social fabric, and violating them in order to accomplish ethical good. Training in the ''l\u01d0'' of past sages cultivates in people virtues that include ethical judgment about when ''l\u01d0'' must be adapted in light of situational contexts.\n\nIn Confucianism, the concept of ''li'' is closely related to ''y\u00ec'' ({{lang|zh|\u7fa9}}), which is based upon the idea of reciprocity. ''Y\u00ec'' can be translated as [[righteousness]], though it may simply mean what is ethically best to do in a certain context. The term contrasts with action done out of [[selfishness|self-interest]]. While pursuing one's own self-interest is not necessarily bad, one would be a better, more righteous person if one's life was based upon following a path designed to enhance the greater good. Thus an outcome of ''y\u00ec'' is doing the right thing for the right reason.\n\nJust as action according to ''[[Li (Confucian)|l\u01d0]]'' should be adapted to conform to the aspiration of adhering to ''y\u00ec'', so ''y\u00ec'' is linked to the core value of ''r\u00e9n'' ({{lang|zh|\u4ec1}}).''[[Ren (Confucianism)|R\u00e9n]]'' consists of five basic virtues: seriousness, generosity, sincerity, diligence and kindness.<ref name=\"Bonevac09-40\">{{Harvnb|Bonevac|Phillips|2009|loc=40}}.</ref> ''R\u00e9n'' is the virtue of perfectly fulfilling one's responsibilities toward others, most often translated as \"benevolence\" or \"humaneness\"; translator [[Arthur Waley]] calls it \"Goodness\" (with a capital ''G''), and other translations that have been put forth include \"authoritativeness\" and \"selflessness.\" Confucius's moral system was based upon [[empathy]] and understanding others, rather than divinely ordained rules. To develop one's spontaneous responses of ''r\u00e9n'' so that these could guide action intuitively was even better than living by the rules of ''y\u00ec''. Confucius asserts that virtue is a mean between extremes. For example, the properly generous person gives the right amount\u2014not too much and not too little.<ref name=\"Bonevac09-40\" />\n\n===Politics===\nConfucius's political thought is based upon his ethical thought. He argued that the best government is one that rules through \"rites\" (''l\u01d0'') and people's [[natural morality]], and ''not'' by using bribery and coercion. He explained that this is one of the most important analects: \"If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishment, but have no sense of shame. If they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of the shame, and moreover will become good.\" (Translated by [[James Legge]]) in the [[Great Learning]] ({{lang|zh|\u5927\u5b78}}). This \"sense of shame\" is an internalisation of [[duty]], where the punishment precedes the evil action, instead of following it in the form of laws as in [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]].\n\nConfucius looked nostalgically upon earlier days, and urged the Chinese, particularly those with political power, to model themselves on earlier examples. In times of division, chaos, and endless wars between feudal states, he wanted to restore the [[Mandate of Heaven]] ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u547d}}) that could unify the \"world\" ({{lang|zh|\u5929\u4e0b}}, \"all under Heaven\") and bestow peace and prosperity on the people. Because his vision of personal and social perfections was framed as a revival of the ordered society of earlier times, Confucius is often considered a great proponent of [[conservatism]], but a closer look at what he proposes often shows that he used (and perhaps twisted) past institutions and rites to push a new political agenda of his own: a revival of a unified royal state, whose rulers would succeed to power on the basis of their moral merits instead of lineage. These would be rulers devoted to their people, striving for personal and social [[perfection]], and such a ruler would spread his own virtues to the people instead of imposing proper behavior with laws and rules.\n\nConfucius did not believe in the concept of \"[[democracy]]\", which is itself an [[Athens|Athenian]] concept unknown in ancient China, but could be interpreted by Confucius's principles recommending against individuals electing their own political leaders to govern them, or that anyone is capable of self-government. He expressed fears that the masses lacked the intellect to make decisions for themselves, and that, in his view, since not everyone is created equal, not everyone has a right of self-government.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Schuman|first1=Michael|title=Confucius: And the World He Created|date=2015|publisher=Basic Books|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wb6DBQAAQBAJ&pg=PT123&lpg=PT123&dq=confucius+everyone+equal#v=onepage&q=confucius%20everyone%20equal&f=false|isbn =978-0-465-04057-5|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWhile he supported the idea of government ruling by a virtuous king, his ideas contained a number of elements to limit the power of rulers. He argued for representing [[truth]] in language, and [[honesty]] was of paramount importance. Even in [[facial expression]], truth must always be represented. Confucius believed that if a ruler is to lead correctly, by action, that orders would be unnecessary in that others will follow the proper actions of their ruler. In discussing the relationship between a king and his subject (or a father and his son), he underlined the need to give due respect to superiors. This demanded that the subordinates must advise their superiors if the superiors are considered to be taking a course of action that is wrong. Confucius believed in ruling by example, if you lead correctly, orders by force or punishment are not necessary.<ref>{{cite web|last=Violatti|first=Cristian|url=http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|title=Confucianism|publisher=Ancient History Encyclopedia|date=August 31, 2013|accessdate=August 17, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150818150049/http://www.ancient.eu/Confucianism/|archivedate=August 18, 2015|df=}}</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2018}}\nConfucius's teachings were later turned into an elaborate set of rules and practices by his numerous disciples and followers, who organized his teachings into the Analects.{{sfnp|Knechtges|Shih|2010|p=645}}{{sfnp|Kim|Csikszentmihalyi|2010|p=25}} Confucius's disciples and his only grandson, [[Zisi]], continued his philosophical school after his death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Focusing the Familiar: A Translation and Philosophical Interpretation of the Zhongyong|author=Ames, Roger T. and David L.

In the centuries after his death, [[Mencius]] ({{lang|zh|\u5b5f\u5b50}}) and [[Xun Zi]] ({{lang|zh|\u8340\u5b50}}) both composed important teachings elaborating in different ways on the fundamental ideas associated with Confucius. [[Mencius]] (4th century BC) articulated the innate goodness in human beings as a source of the ethical intuitions that guide people towards ''r\u00e9n'', ''y\u00ec'', and ''l\u01d0'', while [[Xun Zi]] (3rd century BC) underscored the realistic and materialistic aspects of Confucian thought, stressing that morality was inculcated in society through tradition and in individuals through training. In time, their writings, together with the ''Analects'' and other core texts came to constitute the philosophical corpus of Confucianism.\n\nThis realignment in Confucian thought was parallel to the development of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], which saw filial piety as self-interest and not a useful tool for a ruler to create an effective state. A disagreement between these two political philosophies came to a head in 223 BC when the [[Qin (state)|Qin state]] conquered all of China. [[Li Si]], Prime Minister of the [[Qin dynasty]], convinced [[Qin Shi Huang]] to abandon the Confucians' recommendation of awarding fiefs akin to the [[Zhou Dynasty]] before them which he saw as being against to the Legalist idea of centralizing the state around the ruler. When the Confucian advisers pressed their point, Li Si had many Confucian scholars killed and their books burned\u2014considered a huge blow to the philosophy and Chinese scholarship.\n\nUnder the succeeding [[Han dynasty|Han]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] dynasties, Confucian ideas gained even more widespread prominence. Under [[Emperor Wu of Han|Wudi]], the works of Confucius were made the official imperial philosophy and required reading for civil service examinations in 140 BC which was continued nearly unbroken until the end of the 19th century. As [[Mohism]] lost support by the time of the Han,  the main philosophical contenders were Legalism, which Confucian thought somewhat absorbed, the teachings of [[Laozi]], whose focus on more spiritual ideas kept it from direct conflict with Confucianism, and the new [[Buddhist]] religion, which gained acceptance during the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]] era. Both Confucian ideas and Confucian-trained officials were relied upon in the [[Ming Dynasty]] and even the [[Yuan Dynasty]], although Kublai Khan distrusted handing over provincial control to them.\n\nDuring the [[Song dynasty]], the scholar [[Zhu Xi]] (AD 1130\u20131200) added ideas from [[Daoism]] and [[Buddhism]] into Confucianism. In his life, Zhu Xi was largely ignored, but not long after his death, his ideas became the new orthodox view of what Confucian texts actually meant. Modern historians view Zhu Xi as having created something rather different and call his way of thinking ''[[Neo-Confucianism]]''. Neo-Confucianism held sway in China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam until the 19th century.\n\n[[File:LifeAndWorksOfConfucius1687.jpg|thumb|''Confucius, Philosopher of the Chinese'', published by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] at Paris in 1687.]]\nThe works of Confucius were first translated into European languages by [[Jesuit China missions|Jesuit missionaries]] in the 16th century during the late [[Ming dynasty]].

The [[Han dynasty]] ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'' records that it had already become a place of pilgrimage for ministers. It is still a major destination for cultural tourism, and many people visit his grave and the surrounding temples. In Sinic cultures, there are many temples where representations of the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Laozi]], and Confucius are found together. There are also many [[Temple of Confucius|temples]] dedicated to him, which have been used for Confucian ceremonies.\n\nFollowers of Confucianism have a tradition of holding spectacular memorial ceremonies of Confucius ({{lang|zh|\u796d\u5b54}}) every year, using ceremonies that supposedly derived from Zhou Li ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u79ae}}) as recorded by Confucius, on the date of Confucius's birth. In the 20th century, this tradition was interrupted for several decades in mainland China, where the official stance of the Communist Party and the State was that Confucius and Confucianism represented reactionary [[Feudalism|feudalist]] beliefs which held that the subservience of the people to the [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocracy]] is a part of the natural order. All such ceremonies and rites were therefore banned. Only after the 1990s did the ceremony resume. As it is now considered a veneration of Chinese history and tradition, even Communist Party members may be found in attendance.\n\nIn Taiwan, where the Nationalist Party ([[Kuomintang]]) strongly promoted Confucian beliefs in ethics and behavior, the tradition of the memorial ceremony of Confucius (\u796d\u5b54) is supported by the government and has continued without interruption. While not a national holiday, it does appear on all printed calendars, much as [[Father's Day]] or [[Christmas|Christmas Day]] do in the Western world.\n\nIn [[South Korea]], a grand-scale memorial ceremony called [[Seokjeon Daeje]] is held twice a year on Confucius's birthday and the anniversary of his death, at [[Hyanggyo|Confucian academies]] across the country and [[Sungkyunkwan]] in Seoul.\n\n===Descendants===\n{{See also|Family tree of Confucius in the main line of descent}}\n\nConfucius's descendants were repeatedly identified and honored by successive imperial governments with titles of nobility and official posts. They were honored with the rank of a [[marquess|marquis]] 35 times since [[Gaozu of Han|Gaozu]] of the [[Han dynasty]], and they were promoted to the rank of [[duke]] 42 times from the [[Tang dynasty]] to the [[Qing dynasty]]. [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] first bestowed the title of \"Duke Wenxuan\" on Kong Suizhi of the 35th generation. In 1055, [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] first bestowed the title of \"[[Duke Yansheng]]\" on Kong Zongyuan of the 46th generation.\n\nDuring the [[Southern Song dynasty]], the Duke Yansheng Kong Duanyou fled south with the Song Emperor to [[Quzhou]] in Zhejiang, while the newly established [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)]] in the north appointed Kong Duanyou's brother Kong Duancao who remained in Qufu as Duke Yansheng.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.npm.gov.tw/hotnews/9910seminar/download/en/B10.pdf |title=Descendants and Portraits of Confucius in the Early Southern Song  |accessdate=2016-05-03 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160913134503/http://www.npm.gov.tw/hotnews/9910seminar/download/en/B10.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-13 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://aas2.asian-studies.org/absts/1995abst/china/csess45.htm |title=AAS Abstracts: China Session 45 |first=B.

Mueller specializes in research on the human brain and obsessively conducts experiments on brain tissue, believing that a human brain can be maintained even after a man's death. He also believes that the knowledge contained in a deceased person's brain can be transferred to another person.\n\nMueller is assisted in his attempts to prove his theory by another scientist, Patrick Cory (Richard Arlen), and his young Czechoslovakian-American ward, Janice Farrell (Vera Ralston).\n\nMueller is painfully aware of the fact that his assistants Cory and Janice are attracted to each other, but since Mueller himself is in love with Janice he does everything in his power, including abusing his powers as a boss to assign Cory to additional late night work and use the fact that the young man is far too devoted to his work, to keep the two love-birds apart and improve his own chances. When a plane crashes in the desert close to the laboratory one night, Mueller is asked by the rangers investigating the crash cause to take care of the only surviving man until a physician arrives. The man dies before the doctor gets there and is declared dead. The physician, Dr. Martin, reassures Mueller that someone will come to take care of the body the next day, but while waiting for that person, Mueller decides to test his theory about brain maintenance. With the help of his instruments Mueller is able to decide that the man's brain is still alive enough to use. Before the body is reclaimed he and Cory remove the brain. They are also able to determine, from searching through the dead man's clothes, that the body belongs to an infamous investment banker named William H. Donovan.\n\nIn the morning the wife of the late banker, Mrs. Chloe Donovan (Helen Vinson), arrives with the family lawyer, Eugene Fulton (Sidney Blackmer), to transport the remains from the castle. Upon arrival the lawyer inquires Mueller about the late Donovan's last words and Mueller tells him that there were none, since the man died without regaining his conscience after the crash. Not believing that Mueller is entirely truthful, Fulton remains in the nearby area to further investigate the last hours of Donovan's life before he was declared dead. Despite Janice's pleading Cory insists on staying at the castle to finish the experiment with the brain. Through spying on the castle Fulton finds out that Donovan's brain is still intact in a container, but he doesn't act to retrieve it from the scientists, but lets them continue the experiment, well aware of that Donovan didn't leave a penny for his wife in his will. Fulton has his own interest in the matter, since he is Mrs. Donovan's lover, and he secretly hopes that the scientist succeed in making the brain work, so he can extract information about where Mr. Donovan has hidden away his fortune.\n\nWhen Mueller and Cory treat the brain with plasma, it gains the ability to communicate with the world through telepathy. The brain tells Cory that he must go to the Los Angeles Federal Prison. The plasma stimulation continues with higher and higher doses, even though Janice tries to interrupt the treatment, and soon Cory's brain is hijacked by late Mr. Donovan's brain entirely. Completely under the influence of Mr. Donovan's brain, Cory leaves for Los Angeles Federal Prison and manages to withdraw cash from one of Donovan's hidden accounts. He also manages to convince the police to re-open the investigation against a convicted murderer by the name of Roger Collins (William Henry). Still under the influence of Mr. Donovan, Cory visits Roger Collins in the prison.\n\nDonovan's brain continues to keep complete influence over Cory. Through Cory it tries to force Fulton to help release Collins from prison, but Fulton refuses, claiming that there is too overwhelming evidence against him. A teenager named Mary Lou (Juanita Quigley) has witnessed the crime and as long as she sticks to her story the case is too strong. In an attempt to free Cory from the influence of Donovan's brain, Janice finds out from an investigator named Grimes (Charles Cane), hired by Mrs. Donovan and Fulton, that Cory is trying to bribe the witnesses to withdraw their statements. Grimes has knowledge of Donovan's dirty business and believes that there might be a connection between Collins and Donovan's earlier attempts to get rid of reluctant business counterparts. He also suspects that Donovan will try to get rid of Mary Lou in the same way, using Cory's body. It turns out he is right in his suspicion, as Cory forces Janice to go with him in the car when he tries to run Mary Lou over. When she stops him he tries to kill her instead.\n\nIn a sting of jealousy, Mueller's housekeeper and mistress-wannabe (Mary Nash) feeds sedatives to the brain and it loses its control over Cory, who regains his consciousness. The awakened Cory tells Janice that Collins in fact is Donovan's unknown son, and that Donovan was the one who committed the murder that Collins was convicted for. Having returned to the castle in Arizona Cory tries to abort the experiment, but is hindered by Mueller. They struggle and Mueller end up being shot by the housekeeper, and the brain is smashed to the floor. Cory goes on to help free Collins, and Janice waits for him to complete a short prison sentence for his involvement in the brain experiment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/80606/The-Lady-and-the-Monster/ |title=The Lady and the Monster (1944) - Overview |website=TCM.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-29}}</ref>\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Vera Ralston]] as Janice Farrell\n* [[Richard Arlen]] as Dr. Patrick Cory\n* [[Erich von Stroheim]] as Prof. Franz Mueller\n* [[Helen Vinson]] as Chloe Donovan\n* [[Mary Nash]] as Mrs. Fame, the housekeeper\n* [[Sidney Blackmer]] as Eugene Fulton\n* [[Janet Martin]] as the caf\u00e9 singer\n* [[William Henry (actor)|William Henry]] as Roger Collins\n* Charles Cane as Mr. Grimes\n* [[Juanita Quigley]] as Mary Lou\n* [[Josephine Dillon]] as Mary Lou's grandmother\n* Antonio Triana as himself\n* [[Lola Montes (dancer)|Lola Montes]] as herself\n==Reception==\n{{expand section|date=March 2018}}\nAuthor and film critic [[Leonard Maltin]] awarded the film his usual two and a half out of four stars, his most frequently used rating, calling it \"[a] Pretty good chiller\".<ref name=\"MaltinGreen2010\">{{cite book|author1=Leonard Maltin|author2=Spencer Green|author3=Rob Edelman|title=Leonard Maltin's Classic Movie Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hLtaAAAAYAAJ|date=January 2010|publisher=Plume|isbn=978-0-452-29577-3|page=355}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of American films of 1944]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==See also==\n*''[[Donovan's Brain (film)|Donovan's Brain]]'' (1953) and ''[[The Brain (1962 film)|The Brain]]'' (1962), other film adaptations of the novel\n*''[[The Brain That Wouldn't Die]]'' (1962), a film occasionally confused with ''The Brain''\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n* {{IMDb title|0036999|The Lady and the Monster}}\n* {{Amg movie|98452|The Lady and the Monster}}\n* {{tcmdb title|80606}}\n\n{{George Sherman}}\n{{Donovan's Brain}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Lady and the Monster, The}}\n[[Category:1944 films]]\n[[Category:1944 horror films]]\n[[Category:1940s monster movies]]\n[[Category:1940s science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:American monster movies]]\n[[Category:American science fiction horror films]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films based on American novels]]\n[[Category:Films based on horror novels]]\n[[Category:Films directed by George Sherman]]\n[[Category:Films scored by Walter Scharf]]\n[[Category:Films set in Arizona]]\n[[Category:Mad scientist films]]\n[[Category:Republic Pictures films]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=February 2016}}\n{{All plot|date=May 2015}}\n{{Missing information|the film's production, and theatrical/home media releases|date=May 2015}}}}\n{{Infobox film\n| name           = The Lady and the Monster\n| image          = Lady-and-monster.jpg\n| caption        =\n| director       = [[George Sherman]]\n| producer       = [[George Sherman]]\n| writer         = [[Curt Siodmak]] (novel ''[[Donovan's Brain]]'')\n| screenplay     = [[Frederick Kohner]]<br>Dane Lussier\n| starring       = [[Vera Ralston]]<br>[[Richard Arlen]]<br>[[Erich von Stroheim]]\n| music          = [[Walter Scharf]]<br>[[Marlin Skiles]]\n| cinematography = [[John Alton]]\n| editing        = [[Arthur Roberts (editor)|Arthur Roberts]]\n| studio         = Republic Pictures \n| distributor    = [[Republic Pictures]]\n| released       = {{Film date|1944|04|17|United States}} \n| runtime        = 86 minutes \n| country        = United States\n| language       = English\n| budget         =\n}}\n\n'''''The Lady and the Monster''''' is a 1944 American [[science fiction]] [[horror film]] from Republic Pictures,  directed by [[George Sherman]], and starring [[Vera Ralston]], [[Richard Arlen]], and [[Erich von Stroheim]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036999/fullcredits?ref_=tt_ov_wr#writers|title=The Lady and the Doctor (1944) : Full Cast & Crew|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2016-02-29}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\nThe film is about the attempts to keep alive the brain of a multimillionaire after his death, only to create a telepathic monster.

The film was partially shot on sets at [[Universal Studios Lot]] in California, which were reused at night for the filming of ''[[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]]'', a concurrently produced Spanish-language version of the story also by Universal. \n\n''Dracula'' was a commercial and critical success upon release, and led to several [[sequel]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s. It has had a notable influence on popular culture, and Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula established the character as a [[cultural icon]], as well as the archetypal vampire in later works of fiction. In 2000, the film was selected by the United States [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Renfield]] ([[Dwight Frye]]) is a solicitor traveling to Count Dracula's ([[Bela Lugosi]]) castle in [[Transylvania]] on a business matter. The people in the local village fear that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the inn and asks his carriage driver to take him to the [[Borgo Pass]]. Renfield is driven to the castle by Dracula's coach, with Dracula disguised as the driver. En route, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver to slow down, but sees the driver has disappeared; a bat leads the horses.\n\nRenfield enters the castle welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who, unbeknownst to Renfield, is a [[vampire]]. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax [[Abbey]] in [[London]], where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. Renfield faints as a bat appears and Dracula's three wives close in on him. Dracula waves them away, then attacks Renfield himself.\n\nAboard the [[schooner]] ''Vesta'', Renfield is a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who hides in a coffin and feeds on the ship's crew. When the ship reaches England, Renfield is discovered to be the only living person. Renfield is sent to [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]'s [[sanatorium]] adjoining Carfax Abbey.\n\nAt a London theatre, Dracula meets Seward ([[Herbert Bunston]]). Seward introduces his daughter [[Mina Harker|Mina]] ([[Helen Chandler]]), her fianc\u00e9 [[Jonathan Harker|John Harker]] ([[David Manners]]) and the family friend [[Lucy Westenra|Lucy Weston]] ([[Frances Dade]]). Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula. That night, Dracula enters her room and feasts on her blood while she sleeps. Lucy dies the next day after a string of transfusions.\n\nRenfield is obsessed with eating flies and spiders. [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Van Helsing]] ([[Edward Van Sloan]]) analyzes Renfield's blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon Renfield begs Seward to send him away, claiming his nightly cries may disturb Mina's dreams. When Dracula calls Renfield with wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him [[Aconitum|wolfsbane]], which Van Helsing says is used for protection from vampires.\n\nDracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her. The next evening, Dracula enters for a visit and Van Helsing and Harker notice that he does not have a reflection. When Van Helsing reveals this to Dracula, he smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies.\n\nMina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he attacks her. She is found by the maid. Newspapers report that a woman in white is luring children from the park and biting them. Mina recognizes the lady as Lucy, risen as a vampire. Harker wants to take Mina to London for safety, but is convinced to leave Mina with Van Helsing. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs ([[Joan Standing]]) to take care of Mina when she sleeps, and not to remove the wreath of wolfsbane from her neck.\n\nRenfield escapes from his cell and listens to the men discuss vampires. Before his attendant takes Renfield back to his cell, Renfield relates to them how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanitorium by promising him thousands of rats with blood and life in them. Dracula enters the Seward parlour and talks with Van Helsing. Dracula states that Mina now belongs to him, and warns Van Helsing to return to [[Netherlands|his home country]]. Van Helsing swears to excavate Carfax Abbey and destroy Dracula. Dracula attempts to hypnotize Van Helsing, but the latter's resolve proves stronger. As Dracula lunges at Van Helsing, he withdraws a crucifix from his coat, forcing Dracula to retreat.\n\nHarker visits Mina on a terrace, and she speaks of how much she loves \"nights and fogs\". A bat flies above them and squeaks to Mina. She then attacks Harker but Van Helsing and Seward save him. Mina confesses what Dracula has done to her, and tells Harker their love is finished.\n\nDracula hypnotizes Briggs into removing the wolfsbane from Mina's neck and opening the windows. Van Helsing and Harker see Renfield heading for Carfax Abbey. They see Dracula with Mina in the abbey. When Harker shouts to Mina, Dracula thinks Renfield has led them there. Renfield pleads for his life, but Dracula kills him. Dracula is hunted by Van Helsing and Harker, who know that Dracula is forced to sleep in his coffin during daylight, and the sun is rising.

W. Murnau]]. Bram Stoker's widow sued for [[plagiarism]] and [[copyright infringement]], and the courts decided in her favor, essentially ordering that all [[release print|prints]] of ''Nosferatu'' be destroyed.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Enthusiastic young Hollywood producer [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] also saw the box office potential in Stoker's gothic chiller, and he legally acquired the novel's film rights. Initially, he wanted ''Dracula'' to be a spectacle on a scale with the lavish silent films ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).\n\nAlready a huge hit on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], the Deane/Balderston ''Dracula'' play would become the blueprint as the production gained momentum. The screenwriters carefully studied the silent, unauthorized version, [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu]]'', for inspiration. Lifted directly from a nearly identical scene in ''Nosferatu'' that does not appear in Stoker's novel, was the early scene at the Count's castle when Renfield accidentally pricks his finger on a paper clip and it starts to bleed. Dracula creeps toward him with glee, only to be repelled when the crucifix falls in front of the bleeding finger.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Dracula1931BelaLugosiColor.png|thumb|Colorized still of [[Bela Lugosi]] as Dracula and [[Edward Van Sloan]] as Van Helsing]]\nDecision on casting the title role proved problematic.

Dracula's transition from bat to person is always done off-camera. The film also employs extended periods of silence and character close-ups for dramatic effect, and employs two expository  [[intertitles]] and a closeup of a newspaper article to advance the story, a seeming holdover from [[silent film]]s;  a point made by online [[film critic]] [[James Berardinelli]]<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/dracula31.html Review (2000)] by [[James Berardinelli]] at ReelViews.net</ref> is that the actors' performance style seems to belong to the silent era. Director [[Tod Browning]] had a solid reputation as a silent film director, having made them since 1915, but he never felt completely at ease with sound films.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> He only directed six more films over an eight-year period, the best known being the notorious ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'', a horror movie with [[Olga Baclanova|Baclanova]] and a cast of actual carnival freaks that was yanked from distribution immediately. Browning directed his last film in 1939.\n\n== Music ==\nOwing to the costs of adding an original musical score to a film's soundtrack, no score had ever been composed specifically for the film.<ref name=ebert /> The music heard during the opening credits, an excerpt from Act II of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', was re-used in 1932 for another Universal horror film, ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]''. During the theatre scene where Dracula meets Dr. Seward, Harker, Mina, and Lucy, the end of the overture to [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'' can also be heard as well as the dark opening of [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Schubert's \"Unfinished Symphony\" in B minor]].\n\n=== 1998 score ===\nIn 1998, composer [[Philip Glass]] was commissioned to compose a musical score for the classic film. The score was performed by the [[Kronos Quartet]]<ref name=ebert /> under the direction of Michael Reisman, Glass's usual conductor.\n\nOf the project, Glass said: \"The film is considered a classic. I felt the score needed to evoke the feeling of the world of the 19th century \u2014 for that reason I decided a string quartet would be the most evocative and effective. I wanted to stay away from the obvious effects associated with horror films. With [the Kronos Quartet] we were able to add depth to the emotional layers of the film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-aug-26-ca-3726-story.html|title=Lugosi's 'Dracula' and 'Living Dead' Get a Jump on Halloween|last=King|first=Susan|date=August 26, 1999|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film, with this new score, was released by [[Universal Studios]] in 1999 in the [[VHS]] format.

In spite of the literary credentials of the source material, it was uncertain if an American audience was prepared for a serious full length supernatural chiller. Though American audiences had been exposed to other chillers before, such as ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1927), this was a horror story with no comic relief or trick ending that downplayed the supernatural. Despite this, ''Dracula'' proved to be a box office success.\n\nWhen the film finally premiered at the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in New York City on February 12, 1931 (released two days later throughout the U.S.),<ref name=\"Sin42\" /> newspapers reported that members of the audiences fainted in shock at the horror on screen. This publicity, shrewdly orchestrated by the film studio, helped ensure people came to see the film, if for no other reason than curiosity. Within 48 hours of its opening at New York's Roxy Theatre, it had sold 50,000 tickets,<ref name=\"Sin42\" /> building a momentum that culminated in a $700,000 profit, the largest of Universal's 1931 releases.{{sfn|Vieira|2003|p=35}}\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe film was generally well received by critics upon its release.

Universal in particular would become the forefront of early horror cinema, with a canon of films including ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932), ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933), ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), and ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941).\n\nIn 1936, five years after release, Universal released ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'', a direct [[sequel]] that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' starring [[Lon Chaney Jr.]], followed in 1943. The Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: 1944's ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'', 1945's ''[[House of Dracula]]'' and 1948's comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. Universal would only cast Lugosi as Dracula in one more film, the aforesaid [[Abbott and Costello]] vehicle,{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1977|p=60}} giving the role to [[John Carradine]] for the mid-1940s \"monster rally\" films, although Carradine admittedly more closely resembled Stoker's physical description from the book. Many of the familiar images of Dracula are from stills of the older Lugosi made during the filming of the 1948 comedy, so there remain two confusingly distinct incarnations of Lugosi as Dracula, seventeen years apart in age. As Lugosi played a vampire in three other movies during his career,{{efn|Lugosi played vampires in ''[[Mark of the Vampire]]'' (1935), ''[[The Return of the Vampire]]'' (1943) and ''[[Mother Riley Meets the Vampire]]'' (1952).{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1977|p=60}}}} this contributed to the public misconception that he portrayed Dracula on film many times.\n\nSince its release, ''Dracula'' has become widely regarded as a classic of the era and of its genre. In 2000, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> It was also ranked 79th on [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s countdown of ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2948-100-scariest-movie-moments?page=2|title=Parhaat Netticasinot ja esittelyt \u2013 Tutustu ja lunasta suosituimmat casinobonukset!|website=Parhaat Netticasinot ja esittelyt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104053809/http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2948-100-scariest-movie-moments?page=2|archive-date=November 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTo many film lovers and critics alike, Lugosi's portrayal is widely regarded as the definitive Dracula. Lugosi had a powerful presence and authority on-screen. The slow, deliberate pacing of his performance (\"I bid you\u2026 welcome!\" and \"I never drink\u2026 wine!\") gave his Dracula the air of a walking, talking corpse, which terrified the movie audiences at the time, compelling with no dialogue, and the many close-ups of Lugosi's face in icy silence jumped off the screen. With this mesmerizing performance, Dracula became Bela Lugosi's signature role, his Dracula a [[cultural icon]], and he himself a legend in the classic [[Universal Horror]] film series.\n\nHowever, Dracula would ultimately become a role which would prove to be both a blessing and a curse. Despite his earlier stage successes in a variety of roles, from the moment Lugosi donned the cape on screen, it would forever see him [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as the Count.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bela Lugosi in Person|last1=Kaffenberger|first1=William M., Jr. |last2=Rhodes|first2=Gary D.|last3=Croft|first3=Ann|date=May 25, 2015|publisher=BearManor Media|isbn=978-1-59393-805-5|location=Albany, GA|language=English}}</ref>\n\nBrowning would go on to direct Lugosi once more in another vampire thriller, ''[[Mark of the Vampire]]'', a 1935 remake of his lost silent film ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]'' (1927).\n\nAlso, the film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2001: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills]] \u2013 #85<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/thrills100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date= |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>\n* 2003: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains]]:\n** [[Count Dracula]] \u2013 #33 Villain<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/handv100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date= |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>\n* 2005: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]:\n** Count Dracula: \"Listen to them.

Balderston|Balderston]], contributed much of Dracula's popular [[iconography]], much of which vastly differs from Stoker's novel. In the novel and in the German silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), Dracula's appearance is repulsive; Lugosi portrays the Count as a handsome, charming [[Nobility|nobleman]]. The Deane-Balderston play and this film also introduced the now iconic images of Dracula entering his victims' bedrooms through French doors/windows, wrapping his satin-lined cape around victims, and more emphasis on Dracula transforming into a bat. In the Stoker novel, he variously transformed into a bat or a wolf,<ref name=\"DVD\" /> [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/345/345-h/345-h.htm#CHAPTER_XVIII a mist or \"elemental dust.\"]\n\nThe now classic Dracula line, \"I never drink ... wine\", is original to this film. It did not appear in Stoker's novel or the original production of the play. When the play was revived on Broadway in 1977 starring [[Frank Langella]], the line was added to the script.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n== Home media ==\nIn the 1990s, [[MCA/Universal Home Video]] released ''Dracula'' on [[VHS]] as part of the \"Universal Monsters Classic Collection\", a series of releases of [[Universal Classic Monsters]] films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/6300181278/|title=Dracula (Universal Monsters Classic Collection) [VHS]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> The film was also released on [[LaserDisc]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/43957/23001/Dracula:-The-Restored-Version|title=Dracula: The Restored Version|website=LaserDisc Database|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Universal released ''Dracula'' on VHS and [[DVD]] as part of the \"Classic Monster Collection\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-VHS-Bela-Lugosi/dp/B00000JPHD/|title=Dracula (Classic Monster Collection) [VHS]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Universal-Studios-Classic-Collection/dp/B000035Z3K/|title=Dracula (Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection) [DVD]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/1252/dracula-1931/|title=Dracula-1931|last=Arrington|first=Chuck|date=November 7, 2000|website=[[DVD Talk]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> In 2004, Universal released ''Dracula: The Legacy Collection'' on DVD as part of the \"Universal Legacy Collection\".<ref name=amazon2004>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Collection-Spanish-Draculas-Daughter/dp/B0001CNRLG/|title=Dracula -

It is based on the 1924 stage play ''[[Dracula (1924 play)|Dracula]]'' by [[Hamilton Deane]] and [[John L.

The film was partially shot on sets at [[Universal Studios Lot]] in California, which were reused at night for the filming of ''[[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]]'', a concurrently produced Spanish-language version of the story also by Universal. \n\n''Dracula'' was a commercial and critical success upon release, and led to several [[sequel]]s and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s. It has had a notable influence on popular culture, and Lugosi's portrayal of Dracula established the character as a [[cultural icon]], as well as the archetypal vampire in later works of fiction. In 2000, the film was selected by the United States [[Library of Congress]] for preservation in the [[National Film Registry]] as \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".\n\n== Plot ==\n[[Renfield]] ([[Dwight Frye]]) is a solicitor traveling to Count Dracula's ([[Bela Lugosi]]) castle in [[Transylvania]] on a business matter. The people in the local village fear that vampires inhabit the castle and warn Renfield not to go there. Renfield refuses to stay at the inn and asks his carriage driver to take him to the [[Borgo Pass]]. Renfield is driven to the castle by Dracula's coach, with Dracula disguised as the driver. En route, Renfield sticks his head out the window to ask the driver to slow down, but sees the driver has disappeared; a bat leads the horses.\n\nRenfield enters the castle welcomed by the charming but eccentric Count, who, unbeknownst to Renfield, is a [[vampire]]. They discuss Dracula's intention to lease Carfax [[Abbey]] in [[London]], where he intends to travel the next day. Dracula hypnotizes Renfield into opening a window. Renfield faints as a bat appears and Dracula's three wives close in on him. Dracula waves them away, then attacks Renfield himself.\n\nAboard the [[schooner]] ''Vesta'', Renfield is a raving lunatic slave to Dracula, who hides in a coffin and feeds on the ship's crew. When the ship reaches England, Renfield is discovered to be the only living person. Renfield is sent to [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]'s [[sanatorium]] adjoining Carfax Abbey.\n\nAt a London theatre, Dracula meets Seward ([[Herbert Bunston]]). Seward introduces his daughter [[Mina Harker|Mina]] ([[Helen Chandler]]), her fianc\u00e9 [[Jonathan Harker|John Harker]] ([[David Manners]]) and the family friend [[Lucy Westenra|Lucy Weston]] ([[Frances Dade]]). Lucy is fascinated by Count Dracula. That night, Dracula enters her room and feasts on her blood while she sleeps. Lucy dies the next day after a string of transfusions.\n\nRenfield is obsessed with eating flies and spiders. [[Abraham Van Helsing|Professor Van Helsing]] ([[Edward Van Sloan]]) analyzes Renfield's blood and discovers his obsession. He starts talking about vampires, and that afternoon Renfield begs Seward to send him away, claiming his nightly cries may disturb Mina's dreams. When Dracula calls Renfield with wolf howling, Renfield is disturbed by Van Helsing showing him [[Aconitum|wolfsbane]], which Van Helsing says is used for protection from vampires.\n\nDracula visits Mina, asleep in her bedroom, and bites her. The next evening, Dracula enters for a visit and Van Helsing and Harker notice that he does not have a reflection. When Van Helsing reveals this to Dracula, he smashes the mirror and leaves. Van Helsing deduces that Dracula is the vampire behind the recent tragedies.\n\nMina leaves her room and runs to Dracula in the garden, where he attacks her. She is found by the maid. Newspapers report that a woman in white is luring children from the park and biting them. Mina recognizes the lady as Lucy, risen as a vampire. Harker wants to take Mina to London for safety, but is convinced to leave Mina with Van Helsing. Van Helsing orders Nurse Briggs ([[Joan Standing]]) to take care of Mina when she sleeps, and not to remove the wreath of wolfsbane from her neck.\n\nRenfield escapes from his cell and listens to the men discuss vampires. Before his attendant takes Renfield back to his cell, Renfield relates to them how Dracula convinced Renfield to allow him to enter the sanitorium by promising him thousands of rats with blood and life in them. Dracula enters the Seward parlour and talks with Van Helsing. Dracula states that Mina now belongs to him, and warns Van Helsing to return to [[Netherlands|his home country]]. Van Helsing swears to excavate Carfax Abbey and destroy Dracula. Dracula attempts to hypnotize Van Helsing, but the latter's resolve proves stronger. As Dracula lunges at Van Helsing, he withdraws a crucifix from his coat, forcing Dracula to retreat.\n\nHarker visits Mina on a terrace, and she speaks of how much she loves \"nights and fogs\". A bat flies above them and squeaks to Mina. She then attacks Harker but Van Helsing and Seward save him. Mina confesses what Dracula has done to her, and tells Harker their love is finished.\n\nDracula hypnotizes Briggs into removing the wolfsbane from Mina's neck and opening the windows. Van Helsing and Harker see Renfield heading for Carfax Abbey. They see Dracula with Mina in the abbey. When Harker shouts to Mina, Dracula thinks Renfield has led them there. Renfield pleads for his life, but Dracula kills him. Dracula is hunted by Van Helsing and Harker, who know that Dracula is forced to sleep in his coffin during daylight, and the sun is rising. Van Helsing prepares a wooden stake while Harker searches for Mina. Van Helsing impales Dracula through the heart, killing him, and Mina returns to normal.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Bela Lugosi as Dracula, anonymous photograph from 1931, Universal Studios.jpg|right|thumb|upright|[[Bela Lugosi]] as Dracula]]\n{{Cast list |\n* [[Bela Lugosi]] as [[Count Dracula]]\n* [[Helen Chandler]] as [[Mina Harker|Mina Seward]]\n* [[David Manners]] as [[Jonathan Harker|John Harker]]\n* [[Dwight Frye]] as [[Renfield]]\n* [[Edward Van Sloan]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing|Van Helsing]]\n* [[Herbert Bunston]] as [[John Seward|Dr. Seward]]\n* [[Frances Dade]] as [[Lucy Westenra|Lucy Weston]]\n* [[Joan Standing]] as Nurse Briggs (in an error on the [[opening credits]], she is misidentified as \"Maid\")<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n* [[Charles K.

Bram Stoker's widow sued for [[plagiarism]] and [[copyright infringement]], and the courts decided in her favor, essentially ordering that all [[release print|prints]] of ''Nosferatu'' be destroyed.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> Enthusiastic young Hollywood producer [[Carl Laemmle, Jr.]] also saw the box office potential in Stoker's gothic chiller, and he legally acquired the novel's film rights. Initially, he wanted ''Dracula'' to be a spectacle on a scale with the lavish silent films ''[[The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1923 film)|The Hunchback of Notre Dame]]'' (1923) and ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' (1925).\n\nAlready a huge hit on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]], the Deane/Balderston ''Dracula'' play would become the blueprint as the production gained momentum. The screenwriters carefully studied the silent, unauthorized version, [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu]]'', for inspiration. Lifted directly from a nearly identical scene in ''Nosferatu'' that does not appear in Stoker's novel, was the early scene at the Count's castle when Renfield accidentally pricks his finger on a paper clip and it starts to bleed. Dracula creeps toward him with glee, only to be repelled when the crucifix falls in front of the bleeding finger.\n\n== Production ==\n[[File:Dracula1931BelaLugosiColor.png|thumb|Colorized still of [[Bela Lugosi]] as Dracula and [[Edward Van Sloan]] as Van Helsing]]\nDecision on casting the title role proved problematic. Initially, Laemmle was not at all interested in Lugosi, in spite of good reviews for his stage portrayal.

Dracula's transition from bat to person is always done off-camera. The film also employs extended periods of silence and character close-ups for dramatic effect, and employs two expository  [[intertitles]] and a closeup of a newspaper article to advance the story, a seeming holdover from [[silent film]]s;  a point made by online [[film critic]] [[James Berardinelli]]<ref>[http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/d/dracula31.html Review (2000)] by [[James Berardinelli]] at ReelViews.net</ref> is that the actors' performance style seems to belong to the silent era. Director [[Tod Browning]] had a solid reputation as a silent film director, having made them since 1915, but he never felt completely at ease with sound films.<ref name=\"DVD\" /> He only directed six more films over an eight-year period, the best known being the notorious ''[[Freaks (1932 film)|Freaks]]'', a horror movie with [[Olga Baclanova|Baclanova]] and a cast of actual carnival freaks that was yanked from distribution immediately. Browning directed his last film in 1939.\n\n== Music ==\nOwing to the costs of adding an original musical score to a film's soundtrack, no score had ever been composed specifically for the film.<ref name=ebert /> The music heard during the opening credits, an excerpt from Act II of [[Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Swan Lake]]'', was re-used in 1932 for another Universal horror film, ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]''. During the theatre scene where Dracula meets Dr. Seward, Harker, Mina, and Lucy, the end of the overture to [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Die Meistersinger von N\u00fcrnberg]]'' can also be heard as well as the dark opening of [[Symphony No. 8 (Schubert)|Schubert's \"Unfinished Symphony\" in B minor]].\n\n=== 1998 score ===\nIn 1998, composer [[Philip Glass]] was commissioned to compose a musical score for the classic film. The score was performed by the [[Kronos Quartet]]<ref name=ebert /> under the direction of Michael Reisman, Glass's usual conductor.\n\nOf the project, Glass said: \"The film is considered a classic. I felt the score needed to evoke the feeling of the world of the 19th century \u2014 for that reason I decided a string quartet would be the most evocative and effective. I wanted to stay away from the obvious effects associated with horror films. With [the Kronos Quartet] we were able to add depth to the emotional layers of the film.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-aug-26-ca-3726-story.html|title=Lugosi's 'Dracula' and 'Living Dead' Get a Jump on Halloween|last=King|first=Susan|date=August 26, 1999|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe film, with this new score, was released by [[Universal Studios]] in 1999 in the [[VHS]] format.

In spite of the literary credentials of the source material, it was uncertain if an American audience was prepared for a serious full length supernatural chiller. Though American audiences had been exposed to other chillers before, such as ''[[The Cat and the Canary (1927 film)|The Cat and the Canary]]'' (1927), this was a horror story with no comic relief or trick ending that downplayed the supernatural. Despite this, ''Dracula'' proved to be a box office success.\n\nWhen the film finally premiered at the [[Roxy Theatre (New York City)|Roxy Theatre]] in New York City on February 12, 1931 (released two days later throughout the U.S.),<ref name=\"Sin42\" /> newspapers reported that members of the audiences fainted in shock at the horror on screen. This publicity, shrewdly orchestrated by the film studio, helped ensure people came to see the film, if for no other reason than curiosity. Within 48 hours of its opening at New York's Roxy Theatre, it had sold 50,000 tickets,<ref name=\"Sin42\" /> building a momentum that culminated in a $700,000 profit, the largest of Universal's 1931 releases.{{sfn|Vieira|2003|p=35}}\n\n=== Critical reception ===\nThe film was generally well received by critics upon its release.

Universal in particular would become the forefront of early horror cinema, with a canon of films including ''[[The Mummy (1932 film)|The Mummy]]'' (1932), ''[[The Invisible Man (1933 film)|The Invisible Man]]'' (1933), ''[[Bride of Frankenstein]]'' (1935), and ''[[The Wolf Man (1941 film)|The Wolf Man]]'' (1941).\n\nIn 1936, five years after release, Universal released ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'', a direct [[sequel]] that starts immediately after the end of the first film. A second sequel, ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]'' starring [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], followed in 1943. The Count returned to life in three more Universal films of the mid-1940s: 1944's ''[[House of Frankenstein (1944 film)|House of Frankenstein]]'', 1945's ''[[House of Dracula]]'' and 1948's comedy ''[[Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein]]''. Universal would only cast Lugosi as Dracula in one more film, the aforesaid [[Abbott and Costello]] vehicle,{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1977|p=60}} giving the role to [[John Carradine]] for the mid-1940s \"monster rally\" films, although Carradine admittedly more closely resembled Stoker's physical description from the book. Many of the familiar images of Dracula are from stills of the older Lugosi made during the filming of the 1948 comedy, so there remain two confusingly distinct incarnations of Lugosi as Dracula, seventeen years apart in age. As Lugosi played a vampire in three other movies during his career,{{efn|Lugosi played vampires in ''[[Mark of the Vampire]]'' (1935), ''[[The Return of the Vampire]]'' (1943) and ''[[Mother Riley Meets the Vampire]]'' (1952).{{sfn|Fitzgerald|1977|p=60}}}} this contributed to the public misconception that he portrayed Dracula on film many times.\n\nSince its release, ''Dracula'' has become widely regarded as a classic of the era and of its genre. In 2000, it was selected for preservation in the U.S. [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]] as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing|publisher=[[Library of Congress]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> It was also ranked 79th on [[Bravo (U.S. TV channel)|Bravo]]'s countdown of ''[[The 100 Scariest Movie Moments]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2948-100-scariest-movie-moments?page=2|title=Parhaat Netticasinot ja esittelyt \u2013 Tutustu ja lunasta suosituimmat casinobonukset!|website=Parhaat Netticasinot ja esittelyt|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104053809/http://www.listsofbests.com/list/2948-100-scariest-movie-moments?page=2|archive-date=November 4, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nTo many film lovers and critics alike, Lugosi's portrayal is widely regarded as the definitive Dracula. Lugosi had a powerful presence and authority on-screen. The slow, deliberate pacing of his performance (\"I bid you\u2026 welcome!\" and \"I never drink\u2026 wine!\") gave his Dracula the air of a walking, talking corpse, which terrified the movie audiences at the time, compelling with no dialogue, and the many close-ups of Lugosi's face in icy silence jumped off the screen. With this mesmerizing performance, Dracula became Bela Lugosi's signature role, his Dracula a [[cultural icon]], and he himself a legend in the classic [[Universal Horror]] film series.\n\nHowever, Dracula would ultimately become a role which would prove to be both a blessing and a curse. Despite his earlier stage successes in a variety of roles, from the moment Lugosi donned the cape on screen, it would forever see him [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as the Count.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Bela Lugosi in Person|last1=Kaffenberger|first1=William M., Jr. |last2=Rhodes|first2=Gary D.|last3=Croft|first3=Ann|date=May 25, 2015|publisher=BearManor Media|isbn=978-1-59393-805-5|location=Albany, GA|language=English}}</ref>\n\nBrowning would go on to direct Lugosi once more in another vampire thriller, ''[[Mark of the Vampire]]'', a 1935 remake of his lost silent film ''[[London After Midnight (film)|London After Midnight]]'' (1927).\n\nAlso, the film is recognized by [[American Film Institute]] in these lists:\n* 2001: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills]] \u2013 #85<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/thrills100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date= |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>\n* 2003: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains]]:\n** [[Count Dracula]] \u2013 #33 Villain<ref>{{cite web|last= |first= |title=AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes & Villains |url=http://www.afi.com/Docs/100Years/handv100.pdf |publisher=[[American Film Institute]] |date= |access-date=August 20, 2016}}</ref>\n* 2005: [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes]]:\n** Count Dracula: \"Listen to them.

Balderston|Balderston]], contributed much of Dracula's popular [[iconography]], much of which vastly differs from Stoker's novel. In the novel and in the German silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922), Dracula's appearance is repulsive; Lugosi portrays the Count as a handsome, charming [[Nobility|nobleman]]. The Deane-Balderston play and this film also introduced the now iconic images of Dracula entering his victims' bedrooms through French doors/windows, wrapping his satin-lined cape around victims, and more emphasis on Dracula transforming into a bat. In the Stoker novel, he variously transformed into a bat or a wolf,<ref name=\"DVD\" /> [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/345/345-h/345-h.htm#CHAPTER_XVIII a mist or \"elemental dust.\"]\n\nThe now classic Dracula line, \"I never drink ... wine\", is original to this film. It did not appear in Stoker's novel or the original production of the play. When the play was revived on Broadway in 1977 starring [[Frank Langella]], the line was added to the script.<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n== Home media ==\nIn the 1990s, [[MCA/Universal Home Video]] released ''Dracula'' on [[VHS]] as part of the \"Universal Monsters Classic Collection\", a series of releases of [[Universal Classic Monsters]] films.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/6300181278/|title=Dracula (Universal Monsters Classic Collection) [VHS]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> The film was also released on [[LaserDisc]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lddb.com/laserdisc/43957/23001/Dracula:-The-Restored-Version|title=Dracula: The Restored Version|website=LaserDisc Database|access-date=January 19, 2020}}</ref>\n\nIn 1999, Universal released ''Dracula'' on VHS and [[DVD]] as part of the \"Classic Monster Collection\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-VHS-Bela-Lugosi/dp/B00000JPHD/|title=Dracula (Classic Monster Collection) [VHS]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Universal-Studios-Classic-Collection/dp/B000035Z3K/|title=Dracula (Universal Studios Classic Monster Collection) [DVD]|website=[[Amazon.com]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/1252/dracula-1931/|title=Dracula-1931|last=Arrington|first=Chuck|date=November 7, 2000|website=[[DVD Talk]]|access-date=January 16, 2020}}</ref> In 2004, Universal released ''Dracula: The Legacy Collection'' on DVD as part of the \"Universal Legacy Collection\".<ref name=amazon2004>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Dracula-Collection-Spanish-Draculas-Daughter/dp/B0001CNRLG/|title=Dracula -

Their only wins came against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] (5\u20131) and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (4\u20131), while they lost two games to [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]].\n\nThe national association, the [[National Autonomous Federation of Football of Honduras]] (FENAFUTH) was founded in 1935. It joined [[FIFA]] in 1946 and co-founded [[CONCACAF]] in 1961.<ref name=found>{{cite web|title=Honduras - Association Information|url=https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=HON/about.html|publisher=FIFA}}</ref>\n\n===1970 World Cup and the Football War===\nPrior to the qualification stages leading up to the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] in Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador found themselves in what was called the [[Football War]]. This nickname was given to the situation after an play-off game was played between the two countries to decide which would qualify for the Finals. This political crisis eventually turned into a war that lasted approximately 100 hours.\n\nHonduras had begun qualifying by defeating Costa Rica and Jamaica. Against Jamaica, they easily won both games, 5\u20131 on aggregate. They beat Costa Rica 1\u20130 in [[Tegucigalpa]] and drew 1\u20131 away. This set up a final match between Honduras and El Salvador, who had eliminated Guyana and the Netherlands Antilles.\n\nIn the first game against El Salvador, Honduras won 1\u20130 in Tegucigalpa on 8 June 1969. Honduras were coached by [[Carlos Padilla Vel\u00e1squez]] and the only goal of the game was scored by Leonard Welch. Honduras lost the second game 3\u20130 in [[San Salvador]], and a play-off was required in the [[Estadio Azteca|Azteca Stadium]] in Mexico City on 27 June. El Salvador won 3\u20132 to qualify and eliminate Honduras.\n\n===1982 World Cup===\n{{main|1982 FIFA World Cup}}\nHonduras won the [[1981 CONCACAF Championship]] and qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]]. Despite drawing against the hosts [[Spain national football team|Spain]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]], both 1\u20131, they were eliminated in the first round after losing their last match to [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] 1\u20130.\n{{1982 FIFA World Cup group tables|Group 5|showteam=HON}}\n\nHonduras finished second in the [[1985 CONCACAF Championship]], losing their final match 2\u20131 against [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]], who went on to qualify for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]]. Their next major accomplishment was being runners-up at the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], losing against the host nation, the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]].\n\nFor the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] eliminated Honduras at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)#Group 3 2|third round]] stage. Despite Honduras's overwhelming 11\u20133 victory against [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national football team|Saint Vincent & the Grenadines]], Jamaica defeated Mexico at [[Independence Park (Jamaica)|Independence Park, Kingston]], allowing the Reggae Boys to advance to the next round.\n\n===2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\n{{main|2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica}}\nSince 1993, [[CONMEBOL]] has invited teams from other confederations to participate in their confederation championship, the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]].

The team arrived only a few hours before the tournament's first game and with barely enough players. Despite the odds, Honduras progressed into the quarter-finals, where they defeated [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 2\u20130. In the semi-finals, [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] knocked out Honduras 2\u20130.\n\nHonduras advanced to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF final round|final round]] in the qualifying competition for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], but again failed to qualify after losing at home to [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad & Tobago]], and away against Mexico in their final two matches.

They qualified for the final round by finishing first in their group, which included [[Panama national football team|Panama]], Canada and [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. After beginning with a home defeat against Panama, Honduras recovered and beat Canada 8\u20131 in their final match, allowing them to win the group ahead of Panama.\n\nIn the final round of qualifying, the [[Hexagonal (CONCACAF)|Hexagonal]], six teams faced each other in a home-and-away format. In their first two games, Honduras defeated the United States 2\u20131 and came back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2\u20132 with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. They lost three of their next four matches before travelling to [[Mexico City]] to face Mexico in the [[Estadio Azteca|Azteca]]. Honduras again trailed but scored twice in the second half for a stunning [[Aztecazo#Honduran Aztecazo|2\u20131 win]]. They returned to Tegucigalpa, where they drew 2\u20132 against Panama, who escaped defeat with a last-minute goal by [[Roberto Chen]]. In the final two games, Honduras beat Costa Rica 1\u20130 at home and qualified with a 2\u20132 draw against Jamaica in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. {{:2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013  CONCACAF Fourth Round|showteam=HON}}\n\n{{main|2014 FIFA World Cup Group E}}\nIn the Finals in Brazil, Honduras again finished bottom of their first round group, after 3\u20130 defeats against [[France national football team|France]] and Switzerland, and a 2\u20131 defeat to [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]]. The [[2014 FIFA World Cup Group E#France vs Honduras|match against France]] featured the first use of [[goal-line technology]] to award a goal at the World Cup: an own-goal by Honduras's goalkeeper, [[Noel Valladares]]. Against Ecuador, [[Carlo Costly]] scored Honduras's first goal in the Finals for 32 years.\n{{2014 FIFA World Cup Group E table|showteam=HON}}\n\nHonduras failed to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]]. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF Fifth Round|Hexagonal stage]] they dropped into fourth place after Panama scored an 88th-minute winning goal in their last match against Costa Rica. Honduras had themselves dropped points by conceding late goals in their two previous games, against Costa Rica and the United States. They entered a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF\u2013AFC play-off)|play-off]] against [[Australia national football team|Australia]], and after a 0\u20130 draw at home, Honduras were eliminated when they lost the second leg in [[Sydney]] 3\u20131.\n\nHonduras have won the [[UNCAF Nations Cup]] four times: in [[UNCAF Nations Cup 1993|1993]], [[UNCAF Nations Cup 1995|1995]], [[2011 Copa Centroamericana|2011]] and [[2017 Copa Centroamericana|2017]].\n\n==Home stadium==\n\nHonduras plays the majority of its home games at [[Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Metropolitano]] in [[San Pedro Sula]].\n\nThe national team also plays at [[Estadio Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]] in [[Tegucigalpa]].

The team is governed by the [[National Autonomous Federation of Football of Honduras|Federaci\u00f3n Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de F\u00fatbol de Honduras]] (FENAFUTH). They are nicknamed ''Los [[Hondurans|Catracho]]s'', ''La Bicolor'' or ''La H''.\n\nHonduras has qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]  three times, in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]]. Outside of the FIFA World Cup tournament, Honduras has competed in several other international competitions, like the [[CONCACAF Championship]] which they won in [[1981 CONCACAF Championship|1981]], and the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]] which their best result was third place in [[2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica|2001]].

Their only wins came against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] (5\u20131) and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]] (4\u20131), while they lost two games to [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]] and [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]].\n\nThe national association, the [[National Autonomous Federation of Football of Honduras]] (FENAFUTH) was founded in 1935. It joined [[FIFA]] in 1946 and co-founded [[CONCACAF]] in 1961.<ref name=found>{{cite web|title=Honduras - Association Information|url=https://www.fifa.com/associations/association=HON/about.html|publisher=FIFA}}</ref>\n\n===1970 World Cup and the Football War===\nPrior to the qualification stages leading up to the [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970 World Cup]] in Mexico, Honduras and El Salvador found themselves in what was called the [[Football War]]. This nickname was given to the situation after an play-off game was played between the two countries to decide which would qualify for the Finals. This political crisis eventually turned into a war that lasted approximately 100 hours.\n\nHonduras had begun qualifying by defeating Costa Rica and Jamaica. Against Jamaica, they easily won both games, 5\u20131 on aggregate. They beat Costa Rica 1\u20130 in [[Tegucigalpa]] and drew 1\u20131 away. This set up a final match between Honduras and El Salvador, who had eliminated Guyana and the Netherlands Antilles.\n\nIn the first game against El Salvador, Honduras won 1\u20130 in Tegucigalpa on 8 June 1969. Honduras were coached by [[Carlos Padilla Vel\u00e1squez]] and the only goal of the game was scored by Leonard Welch. Honduras lost the second game 3\u20130 in [[San Salvador]], and a play-off was required in the [[Estadio Azteca|Azteca Stadium]] in Mexico City on 27 June. El Salvador won 3\u20132 to qualify and eliminate Honduras.\n\n===1982 World Cup===\n{{main|1982 FIFA World Cup}}\nHonduras won the [[1981 CONCACAF Championship]] and qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time in [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1982]].

Their next major accomplishment was being runners-up at the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], losing against the host nation, the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]].\n\nFor the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] eliminated Honduras at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)#Group 3 2|third round]] stage. Despite Honduras's overwhelming 11\u20133 victory against [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national football team|Saint Vincent & the Grenadines]], Jamaica defeated Mexico at [[Independence Park (Jamaica)|Independence Park, Kingston]], allowing the Reggae Boys to advance to the next round.\n\n===2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica===\n{{main|2001 Copa Am\u00e9rica}}\nSince 1993, [[CONMEBOL]] has invited teams from other confederations to participate in their confederation championship, the [[Copa Am\u00e9rica]].

The team arrived only a few hours before the tournament's first game and with barely enough players. Despite the odds, Honduras progressed into the quarter-finals, where they defeated [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] 2\u20130. In the semi-finals, [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] knocked out Honduras 2\u20130.\n\nHonduras advanced to the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF final round|final round]] in the qualifying competition for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], but again failed to qualify after losing at home to [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad & Tobago]], and away against Mexico in their final two matches.

They qualified for the final round by finishing first in their group, which included [[Panama national football team|Panama]], Canada and [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]]. After beginning with a home defeat against Panama, Honduras recovered and beat Canada 8\u20131 in their final match, allowing them to win the group ahead of Panama.\n\nIn the final round of qualifying, the [[Hexagonal (CONCACAF)|Hexagonal]], six teams faced each other in a home-and-away format. In their first two games, Honduras defeated the United States 2\u20131 and came back from a two-goal deficit to draw 2\u20132 with [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. They lost three of their next four matches before travelling to [[Mexico City]] to face Mexico in the in the [[Estadio Azteca|Azteca]]. Honduras again trailed but scored twice in the second half for a stunning [[Aztecazo#Honduran Aztecazo|2\u20131 win]].

In the final two games, Honduras beat Costa Rica 1\u20130 at home and qualified with a 2\u20132 draw against Jamaica in [[Kingston, Jamaica|Kingston]]. {{:2014 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013  CONCACAF Fourth Round|showteam=HON}}\n\n{{main|2014 FIFA World Cup Group E}}\nIn the Finals in Brazil, Honduras again finished bottom of their first round group, after 3\u20130 defeats against [[France national football team|France]] and Switzerland, and a 2\u20131 defeat to [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]].

Against Ecuador, [[Carlo Costly]] scored Honduras's first goal in the Finals for 32 years.\n{{2014 FIFA World Cup Group E table|showteam=HON}}\n\nHonduras failed to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]]. In the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification \u2013 CONCACAF Fifth Round|Hexagonal stage]] they dropped into fourth place after Panama scored an 88th-minute winning goal in their last match against Costa Rica. Honduras had themselves dropped points by conceding late goals in their two previous games, against Costa Rica and the United States. They entered a [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF\u2013AFC play-off)|play-off]] against [[Australia national football team|Australia]], and after a 0\u20130 draw at home, Honduras were eliminated when they lost the second leg in [[Sydney]] 3\u20131.\n\nHonduras have won the [[UNCAF Nations Cup]] four times: in [[UNCAF Nations Cup 1993|1993]], [[UNCAF Nations Cup 1995|1995]], [[2011 Copa Centroamericana|2011]] and [[2017 Copa Centroamericana|2017]].\n\n==Home stadium==\n\nHonduras plays the majority of its home games at [[Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Metropolitano]] in [[San Pedro Sula]].\n\nThe national team also plays at [[Estadio Tiburcio Car\u00edas Andino]] in [[Tegucigalpa]].
