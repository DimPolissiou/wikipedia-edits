Industrial designer David Crafoord realised the sketches as a 1:5 scale model. This model was later scaled up in order to create the base plug for the initial Koenigsegg prototype that was finished in 1996. During the next years, the prototype went through extensive testing and several new prototypes were built. The prototypes initially used an Audi V8 engine but after the engine supply contract fell through, the next candidate was the [[Flat-12 engine|Flat-12]] race engine developed by [[Motori Moderni]] for the [[Scuderia Coloni#Coloni-Subaru (1990)|Scuderia Coloni]] Formula one team, in which this engine was raced under the Subaru badge in the [[1990 Formula One World Championship|1990 season]]. These [[Subaru 1235]] engines were purchased and modified for use in the CC; this deal failed when the founder of Motori Moderni died, sending the company into bankruptcy.<ref>{{Citation|last=DRIVETRIBE|title=How Koenigsegg nearly used a Subaru F1 engine in its supercars|date=2019-06-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM_-u209ybs|access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=AMA1 With CvK - Early Years and Process |url=https://www.koenigsegg.com/ama1-with-cvk-early-years-and-process/ |website=Koenigsegg |access-date=2019-07-01 |date=2015-08-10}}</ref> Eventually Koenigsegg developed its own engine based on the Ford Modular architecture. Later on, Koenigsegg developed their own engines from scratch, including control systems and transmissions, which is very unusual for a small size Sportscar producer.\n\n===Factory history===\nChristian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian stop-motion animated movie ''[[Pinchcliffe Grand Prix]]'' in his youth.<ref name=\"Nettavisen1\">{{cite news |first=Jon Einar |last=Kolberg |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/bil/article515400.ece |title=Superbilen Koenigsegg blir norsk |trans-title=Supercar Koenigsegg becomes Norwegian |publisher=Nettavisen.no |language=Norwegian |date=2005-12-16 |accessdate=2009-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120225345/http://www.nettavisen.no/bil/article515400.ece |archive-date=2008-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He took his first steps in the world of business in his early 20s running a trading company called ''Alpraaz'' in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. Alpraaz exported food from Europe to the developing world. The success of this venture gave von Koenigsegg the necessary financial standing to launch his chosen career as a car manufacturer.\n\nInitially, Koenigsegg Automotive was based in [[Olofstr\u00f6m]]. In 1997, the company needed larger production facilities and moved to a farm, just outside \u00c4ngelholm. On 22 February 2003, one of the production facilities caught fire and was badly damaged. Koenigsegg then acquired an abandoned air field to use as his new factory building and in late 2003, one of the two large fighter-jet hangars and an office building were converted into a car factory. Since then, the company is located near the still-active \u00c4ngelholm airport, clients can arrive by private jet nearby. Koenigsegg controls and uses the former military runway for shakedown runs of production cars and high-speed testing.\n\nThe Koenigsegg badge was designed in 1994 by Jacob L\u00e5ftman, based on the heraldic coat of arms of the Koenigsegg family. The shield has been the family's [[coat of arms]] since the 12th century when a family member was knighted by the Germany-based [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n=== Ghost Badge ===\nAfter moving into the abandoned airfield, which once housed the Swedish air force's \"Johan R\u00f6d\" squadron, Koenigsegg adopted the \"ghost symbol\" that the squadron had on their planes, which were [[Saab 37 Viggen|Saab AJS37 Viggens]] aircraft (the squad also used the English phrase \"The show must go on\" on their aircraft as well) as a tribute to the squadron. The badge is seen on models built in the factory that was converted from their hangar, including the CCX, Agera, Agera R, One:1, and Regera.\n\n===Attempted purchase of Saab===\nOn 12 June 2009, the media reported that Koenigsegg Group, consisting of Koenigsegg Automotive AB, Christian von Koenigsegg, B\u00e5rd Eker and a group of investors led by Mark Bishop had signed a [[letter of intent]] with [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] to take over the brand from [[General Motors]]. General Motors confirmed on June 16 that they had chosen Koenigsegg Group as the buyer of Saab Automobile.<ref name=\"Forbes2\">{{cite news |url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/16/saab-koenigsegg-update-markets-equity-autos.html |title=Koenigsegg Offers Saab Salvation |work=Forbes.com |date=2009-06-16 |accessdate=2009-06-16 |first=Vidya |last=Ram}}</ref> The deal, set to close 30 September 2009, included {{USD|600 million}} in financing from the [[European Investment Bank]], guaranteed by the Swedish government.

The first customer took delivery of a red [[Koenigsegg CC8S|CC8S]] in 2002 at the [[Geneva Auto Show]] and four more cars were built that year. Koenigsegg was established in Asia later that year with a premiere at the Seoul Auto Show. In 2004, the new [[Koenigsegg CCR|CCR]], which was basically a high performance variant of the CC8S, was unveiled at the Geneva Auto Show; only 14 were produced.\n\nIn 2006, Koenigsegg introduced the CCX, a new model, that was created in order to meet worldwide regulations for road use. This meant the car had to go through extensive development in order to meet the latest and most stringent safety and emission standards that the world's authorities demanded; Koenigsegg had to, for example, develop their own engines and other related technologies. Furthermore, Koenigsegg is the only low-volume sports car manufacturer to pass the new European pedestrian impact tests. Just after Koenigsegg passed this test, the requirement was deemed too complicated for compliance by low-volume manufacturers, so it is now unnecessary to meet these regulations if the production volume of a given model is less than 10,000 cars annually.\n\nIn 2007, Koenigsegg premiered the CCXR, a [[biofuel]]/[[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] version of the CCX. The car features a modified engine, fuel system, and engine management system that enables the car to run on normal gasoline or ethanol, and in any mixture between these two fuels. Ethanol has a higher [[octane]] rating compared to regular fuel and has an internal cooling effect on the combustion chamber, which allows increased performance.\n\nIn 2009, Koenigsegg released information about a special edition car called the [[Koenigsegg Trevita|''Trevita'']], of which three were planned to be made but only two were finished due to technical problems. The ''Trevita'', which translates into English as \"three whites\", has a body made entirely of Koenigsegg's proprietary material consisting of diamond-coated carbon fibre. The ''Trevita'' is based on the CCXR, and therefore has a power output of {{Convert|1018|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} when running on biofuel.<ref name=\"Automoblog1\">{{citation|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/09/12/koenigsegg-trevita/|title=Koenigsegg Trevita - The Shimmering Diamond|publisher=Automoblog.net|date=2009-09-12}}</ref>\n{{Listen\n |filename     =Koenigsegg Agera.ogg\n |title        = Sound of Koenigsegg Agera\n |description  = The [[Koenigsegg Agera]] at [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] 2010\n |type         =sound\n |style        =float:right;clear:none\n}}\n\nIn 2010 Koenigsegg released information at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show about a new model called the Agera, which translates into English as \"take action/act\".

Teaser sketches were released by the company at the same time. Initially, the model was rumoured to be called \"Ragnarok\" but the public unveil of the car at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show revealed the name to be Jesko, after the founder's father Jesko Von Koenigsegg.\nThe Jesko uses a development of the 5.0-litre V8 engine used in the Agera which has a power output of {{cvt|1280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on normal gasoline and has a power output of {{cvt|1600|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|1160|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque at 5,100 rpm on [[E85|E85 biofuel]]. The engine is mated to a 9-speed multi-clutch transmission having seven clutches called the light speed gearbox by the manufacturer. The focus of this transmission is to have faster shift times. The car will come in either in a low drag or a high drag variant with the low drag variant capable of achieving claimed speeds up to {{cvt|300|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\n=== List of models ===\n* [[Koenigsegg CC]] (1996) 1 prototype<ref>{{cite web|url= http://koenigsegg.com/cc-prototype/ |title= CC Prototype |publisher = Koenigsegg |accessdate=2015-07-14}}</ref>\n* [[Koenigsegg CC8S]] (2002\u20132004) 6 units (2 right hand drive) \u2013 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0\u201362&nbsp;mph) under 3.5 sec.

Industrial designer David Crafoord realised the sketches as a 1:5 scale model. This model was later scaled up in order to create the base plug for the initial Koenigsegg prototype that was finished in 1996. During the next years, the prototype went through extensive testing and several new prototypes were built. The prototypes initially used an Audi V8 engine but after the engine supply contract fell through, the next candidate was the [[Flat-12 engine|Flat-12]] race engine developed by [[Motori Moderni]] for the [[Scuderia Coloni#Coloni-Subaru (1990)|Scuderia Coloni]] Formula one team, in which this engine was raced under the Subaru badge in the [[1990 Formula One World Championship|1990 season]]. These [[Subaru 1235]] engines were purchased and modified for use in the CC; this deal failed when the founder of Motori Moderni died, sending the company into bankruptcy.<ref>{{Citation|last=DRIVETRIBE|title=How Koenigsegg nearly used a Subaru F1 engine in its supercars|date=2019-06-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tM_-u209ybs|access-date=2019-06-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=AMA1 With CvK - Early Years and Process |url=https://www.koenigsegg.com/ama1-with-cvk-early-years-and-process/ |website=Koenigsegg |access-date=2019-07-01 |date=2015-08-10}}</ref> Eventually Koenigsegg developed its own engine based on the Ford Modular architecture. Later on, Koenigsegg developed their own engines from scratch, including control systems and transmissions, which is very unusual for a small size Sportscar producer.\n\n===Factory history===\nChristian von Koenigsegg got the idea to build his own car after watching the Norwegian stop-motion animated movie ''[[Pinchcliffe Grand Prix]]'' in his youth.<ref name=\"Nettavisen1\">{{cite news |first=Jon Einar |last=Kolberg |url=http://www.nettavisen.no/bil/article515400.ece |title=Superbilen Koenigsegg blir norsk |trans-title=Supercar Koenigsegg becomes Norwegian |publisher=Nettavisen.no |language=Norwegian |date=2005-12-16 |accessdate=2009-06-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120225345/http://www.nettavisen.no/bil/article515400.ece |archive-date=2008-11-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He took his first steps in the world of business in his early 20s running a trading company called ''Alpraaz'' in [[Stockholm]], Sweden. Alpraaz exported food from Europe to the developing world. The success of this venture gave von Koenigsegg the necessary financial standing to launch his chosen career as a car manufacturer.\n\nInitially, Koenigsegg Automotive was based in [[Olofstr\u00f6m]]. In 1997, the company needed larger production facilities and moved to a farm, just outside \u00c4ngelholm. On 22 February 2003, one of the production facilities caught fire and was badly damaged. Koenigsegg then acquired an abandoned air field to use as his new factory building and in late 2003, one of the two large fighter-jet hangars and an office building were converted into a car factory. Since then, the company is located near the still-active \u00c4ngelholm airport, clients can arrive by private jet nearby. Koenigsegg controls and uses the former military runway for shakedown runs of production cars and high-speed testing.\n\nThe Koenigsegg badge was designed in 1994 by Jacob L\u00e5ftman, based on the heraldic coat of arms of the Koenigsegg family. The shield has been the family's [[coat of arms]] since the 12th century when a family member was knighted by the Germany-based [[Holy Roman Empire]].\n\n=== Ghost Badge ===\nAfter moving into the abandoned airfield, which once housed the Swedish air force's \"Johan R\u00f6d\" squadron, Koenigsegg adopted the \"ghost symbol\" that the squadron had on their planes, which were [[Saab 37 Viggen|Saab AJS37 Viggens]] aircraft (the squad also used the English phrase \"The show must go on\" on their aircraft as well) as a tribute to the squadron. The badge is seen on models built in the factory that was converted from their hangar, including the CCX, Agera, Agera R, One:1, and Regera.\n\n===Attempted purchase of Saab===\nOn 12 June 2009, the media reported that Koenigsegg Group, consisting of Koenigsegg Automotive AB, Christian von Koenigsegg, B\u00e5rd Eker and a group of investors led by Mark Bishop had signed a [[letter of intent]] with [[Saab Automobile|Saab]] to take over the brand from [[General Motors]].

The first customer took delivery of a red [[Koenigsegg CC8S|CC8S]] in 2002 at the [[Geneva Auto Show]] and four more cars were built that year. Koenigsegg was established in Asia later that year with a premiere at the Seoul Auto Show. In 2004, the new [[Koenigsegg CCR|CCR]], which was basically a high performance variant of the CC8S, was unveiled at the Geneva Auto Show; only 14 were produced.\n\nIn 2006, Koenigsegg introduced the CCX, a new model, that was created in order to meet worldwide regulations for road use. This meant the car had to go through extensive development in order to meet the latest and most stringent safety and emission standards that the world's authorities demanded; Koenigsegg had to, for example, develop their own engines and other related technologies. Furthermore, Koenigsegg is the only low-volume sports car manufacturer to pass the new European pedestrian impact tests. Just after Koenigsegg passed this test, the requirement was deemed too complicated for compliance by low-volume manufacturers, so it is now unnecessary to meet these regulations if the production volume of a given model is less than 10,000 cars annually.\n\nIn 2007, Koenigsegg premiered the CCXR, a [[biofuel]]/[[Flexible-fuel vehicle|flex-fuel]] version of the CCX. The car features a modified engine, fuel system, and engine management system that enables the car to run on normal gasoline or ethanol, and in any mixture between these two fuels. Ethanol has a higher [[octane]] rating compared to regular fuel and has an internal cooling effect on the combustion chamber, which allows increased performance.\n\nIn 2009, Koenigsegg released information about a special edition car called the [[Koenigsegg Trevita|''Trevita'']], of which three were planned to be made but only two were finished due to technical problems. The ''Trevita'', which translates into English as \"three whites\", has a body made entirely of Koenigsegg's proprietary material consisting of diamond-coated carbon fibre. The ''Trevita'' is based on the CCXR, and therefore has a power output of {{Convert|1018|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} when running on biofuel.<ref name=\"Automoblog1\">{{citation|url=http://www.automoblog.net/2009/09/12/koenigsegg-trevita/|title=Koenigsegg Trevita - The Shimmering Diamond|publisher=Automoblog.net|date=2009-09-12}}</ref>\n{{Listen\n |filename     =Koenigsegg Agera.ogg\n |title        = Sound of Koenigsegg Agera\n |description  = The [[Koenigsegg Agera]] at [[Goodwood Festival of Speed]] 2010\n |type         =sound\n |style        =float:right;clear:none\n}}\n\nIn 2010 Koenigsegg released information at the 2010 Geneva Motor Show about a new model called the Agera, which translates into English as \"take action/act\".

The Agera's design follows a clear lineage from the previous Koenigsegg sports cars, but adds many special new features, such as a wider front track, new styling and aerodynamic features, and a new interior; including a new lighting technique called \"Ghost Light\" by the manufacturer which consists of microscopic holes to hide the interior lighting until it is turned on, which then shines through what appears to be solid aluminium.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.automoblog.net/2010/03/03/koenigsegg-agera-unleased-at-geneva/|title=Koenigsegg Agera Unleashed at Geneva| publisher=Automoblog.net|date=2010-03-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.koenigsegg.com/wp-content/uploads/Koenigsegg2012.pdf |title=Spirit of performance |publisher=koenigsegg.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710042732/http://www.koenigsegg.com/wp-content/uploads/Koenigsegg2012.pdf |archive-date=2012-07-10 }}</ref> Production of the Agera ended in July 2018 after being in production for eight years when two of the three final edition cars were presented to their customers.\n\nAt the 2015 Geneva Motor Show, Koenigsegg presented a new model named the [[Koenigsegg Regera|''Regera'']], which translates into English as to \"reign\" or \"rule\".

Teaser sketches were released by the company at the same time. Initially, the model was rumoured to be called \"Ragnarok\" but the public unveil of the car at the 2019 Geneva Motor Show revealed the name to be Jesko, after the founder's father Jesko Von Koenigsegg.\nThe Jesko uses a development of the 5.0-litre V8 engine used in the Agera which has a power output of {{cvt|1280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} on normal gasoline and has a power output of {{cvt|1600|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{cvt|1160|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque at 5,100 rpm on [[E85|E85 biofuel]]. The engine is mated to a 9-speed multi-clutch transmission having seven clutches called the light speed gearbox by the manufacturer. The focus of this transmission is to have faster shift times. The car will come in either in a low drag or a high drag variant with the low drag variant capable of achieving claimed speeds up to {{cvt|300|mph|kph|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\n=== List of models ===\n* [[Koenigsegg CC]] (1996) 1 prototype<ref>{{cite web|url= http://koenigsegg.com/cc-prototype/ |title= CC Prototype |publisher = Koenigsegg |accessdate=2015-07-14}}</ref>\n* [[Koenigsegg CC8S]] (2002\u20132004) 6 units (2 right hand drive) \u2013 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h (0\u201362&nbsp;mph) under 3.5 sec.

This unique climatic zone is only possible to objects that has an obliquity range between 45\u00b0 - 135\u00b0. Since the obliquity of Pluto envelops between a minimum of 103\u00b0 to maximum of 127\u00b0, therefore, the dwarf planet also has a tropical arctic climate zone. Due to high obliquity, most of the surface of Pluto experiences both tropical and arctic climate experiences over the 2.8 million years obliquity cycle. <ref name=\":0\" /> The tropical and arctic zones extend as close to 77\u00b0 and 13\u00b0 in both hemispheres, respectively. The tropical arctic zone overlaps between tropical and arctic zones extending between 13\u00b0N to 77\u00b0N and 13\u00b0S to 77\u00b0S. At this latitudinal range the zones cover an area of 75 percent of the total surface area and the majority of the Pluto's surface areas experiences the tropical arctic cycle.

The high obliquity induced in latitude variations in arctics zones extending down to near-equatorial regions indicates that the maximum amount of solar insolation is received (and therefore the maximum energy budget) at the poles. <ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Van Hemelrijck|first=E.|date=1982-12-01|title=The insolation at Pluto|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001910358290015X|journal=Icarus|language=en|volume=52|issue=3|pages=560\u2013564|doi=10.1016/0019-1035(82)90015-X|issn=0019-1035}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Earle|first=Alissa M.|last2=Binzel|first2=Richard P.|date=2015-04-01|title=Pluto\u2019s insolation history: Latitudinal variations and effects on atmospheric pressure|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103514007192|journal=Icarus|language=en|volume=250|pages=405\u2013412|doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2014.12.028|issn=0019-1035}}</ref>\n\n=== Diurnal ===\nThe diurnal climate zone of Pluto is defined as the latitudinal ranges where day and night cycle occur for each and every orbital rotation throughout the entire orbital year. This zone experiences continuous daily sunrise and sunset. The high mean obliquity and oscillation cycle makes the latitude ranges of 13\u00b0N and 13\u00b0S to experiences a diurnal circle. This narrow latitudinal band of 13\u00b0N and 13\u00b0S is, symmetric to equator, called permanent diurnal zone. Pluto experiences the narrowest band of diurnal zone (13\u00b0N and 13\u00b0S) when the obliquity comes down to minimum of 103\u00b0 in around ~0.8 million year ago. The permanent diurnal zone covers an area of 22 percent of the total areas of the dwarf planet. The region experiences a continuous sunrise and sunset for each and every Pluto rotation period of 6.4 days over a time period of 10 million years. <ref name=\":0\" /> The present day diurnal climate zone of Pluto spans from 30\u00b0N to 30\u00b0S, encompasses an area of 50% of the total surface area, with the axial tilt of 120\u00b0. As obliquity changes to rise from current obliquity of 120\u00b0, the diurnal zone will expand to the maximum from 37\u00b0N to 37\u00b0S (covering a total area of 60 percent of the planet) which will be reached in ~0.6 million year. The morphology of this zone is characterized by a nearly uniform width of dark equatorial bands and comprises a zone of the mostly sharply contrasting albedo. <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":5\">{{Cite journal|last=Earle|first=Alissa M.|last2=Binzel|first2=Richard P.|last3=Young|first3=Leslie A.|last4=Stern|first4=S.

This unique climatic zone is only possible to objects that has an obliquity range between 45\u00b0 - 135\u00b0. Since the obliquity of Pluto envelops between a minimum of 103\u00b0 to maximum of 127\u00b0, therefore, the dwarf planet also has a tropical arctic climate zone. Due to high obliquity, most of the surface of Pluto experiences both tropical and arctic climate experiences over the 2.8 million years obliquity cycle. <ref name=\":0\" /> The tropical and arctic zones extend as close to 77\u00b0 and 13\u00b0 in both hemispheres, respectively. The tropical arctic zone overlaps between tropical and arctic zones extending between 13\u00b0N to 77\u00b0N and 13\u00b0S to 77\u00b0S. At this latitudinal range the zones cover an area of 75 percent of the total surface area and the majority of the Pluto's surface areas experiences the tropical arctic cycle. However, like the oscillation of tropical (between 53 - 77\u00b0 latitude) and arctic (between 13 - 37\u00b0 latitude) zones, the tropical arctic zone also expands and contrast in response to the Pluto's obliquity cycles of 2.8 million year. Only the latitude range between 37\u00b0 to 57\u00b0 in each hemisphere remains stable over the period, therefore, this bands of latitudinal ranges are called the permanent tropical arctic zone of Pluto (covers 20% of the total area). <ref name=\":0\" /> The maximum extend of the tropical arctic zones spans between 13 - 77\u00b0 latitude in both southern and northern hemispheres (covers about 75% of the total surface area). With the current obliquity of 120\u00b0, the present day tropical arctic extends from 30\u00b0N to 30\u00b0S encompassing an area of 50% of the Pluto's surface. The tropical arctic zone is the area that experiences maximum cyclical extremes and optimum for long-term seasonal layering (e.g., Al-Isidis latitudes). <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Jeffrey M.|last2=McKinnon|first2=William B.|last3=Spencer|first3=John R.|last4=Howard|first4=Alan D.|last5=Schenk|first5=Paul M.|last6=Beyer|first6=Ross A.|last7=Nimmo|first7=Francis|last8=Singer|first8=Kelsi N.|last9=Umurhan|first9=Orkan M.|last10=White|first10=Oliver L.|last11=Stern|first11=S.

The polar zone has a radius of 13\u00b0 from each pole. <ref name=\":0\" /> The polar zone always experiences arctic climate and does never experiences tropical climate. The zone spans from 77\u00b0N to 90\u00b0N and from 77\u00b0S to 90\u00b0S, encompassing an area total of 3% of the planet. The regions of 77\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 latitudes of each hemisphere is called as permanent range of the polar climate zone. The polar zone is the region that consistently experiences the longest duration of arctic winter and summer during each and every orbital rotation of Pluto. <ref name=\":0\" /> However, the maximum extend of the polar zone can spans up to 53\u00b0N to 90\u00b0N and from 53\u00b0S to 90\u00b0S with an area total of 20% of the planet. At present day the polar zones extend between 60 - 90\u00b0 of both the both northern and southern hemisphere (covers an area of 13% of the planet).

The equatorial regions of Pluto predominated consist of a dark band of distinct boundaries. This equatorial dark band region is coinciding with the permanent diurnal climate zone of Pluto. The high albedo terrain of diurnal zone remains warm enough that no cold trapping is attracted for new volatile. The absence of any interval of arctic winter darkness also preclude the possibilities of volatile cold trapping in the high albedo diurnal zone areas. <ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> On the other hand, the lower albedo region in the diurnal zone has reflectivity to solar insolation. These higher albedo areas radiate away absorbed energy at night for every rotation of the planet and become a cold trap for volatile. <ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":5\" /> The temperature cycle near the equator (in the diurnal zone) maintain a sharp albedo variations between the bright and dark regions. <ref name=\":5\" />\n\nThe correlation between the surface compositional distribution of [[methane]] (CH<sub>4</sub>), [[nitrogen]] (N<sub>2</sub>) and the climate zones are somehow speculative. <ref name=\":0\" /> [[Volatiles|Volatile]] CH<sub>4</sub> is widely distributed outside the [[Tombaugh Regio]] and [[Cthulhu Macula|Cthulhu Regio]] at latitudinal bands of the northern boundary of Cthulhu. <ref name=\":3\" /> On the other hand, volatile N<sub>2</sub> is concentrated in the latitudes above 30\u00b0N coinciding the permanent arctic climate zone which spans from 37\u00b0N to the pole. <ref name=\":3\" /> Some areas on Pluto's surface experience both tropics and arctic climate since both of the climate zones oscillate in response to the obliquity cycle. A substantially large area falls under tropical arctic climate state due to the oscillation of the climate pattern. The layering of the al-Isidis Monts at 37\u00b0N latitude is speculated to be form due to the long-tern climate cycle in this latitude. <ref name=\":0\" /> The latitude of 37\u00b0N is considered as a boundary latitude involving the mixing of tropical (overhead Sun) and arctic (constant dark winter) season. <ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Pluto]]\n* [[Geology of Pluto]]\n* [[Geography of Pluto]]\n* [[Atmosphere of Pluto]]\n\n== References ==\n<references />\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguated:polar\u2192Geographical pole,eccentricity\u2192Orbital eccentricity", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_zones_on_Pluto"}

After working as a physician on reservations in South Dakota, he became increasingly active in politics and issues on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] rights, he worked to improve the lives of youths, and founded thirty-two Native American chapters<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indian History of American Institution|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNLMam3j_48C&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=thirty-two+Native+American+chapters+of+YMCA&source=bl&ots=GausWsMNA7&sig=ACfU3U13G1lTb_rUTh_G7sfP3JMIsDBV0A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx6I2f4tblAhWwGTQIHQNQAcoQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=thirty-two%20Native%20American%20chapters%20of%20YMCA&f=false|pages=}}</ref> of [[YMCA]]. He also helped found the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. He is considered the first Native American author to write American history from the Native American point of view.\n\n==Early life and education==\nEastman was named '''Hakadah''' at his birth in Minnesota; his name meant \"pitiful last\" in [[Dakota language|Dakota]]. Eastman was so named because his mother died following his birth. He was the last of five children of ''Wakantakawin,'' a [[mixed-race]] woman also known as Winona (meaning \"First-Born Daughter\" in the Dakota language) or Mary Nancy Eastman.<ref name=Ruoff/> She and Eastman's father, a Santee Dakota named Wak-anhdi Ota (Many Lightnings), lived on a Santee Dakota reservation near [[Redwood Falls, Minnesota]].\n\nWinona was the only child of [[Seth Eastman]], a U.S. Army officer and illustrator, and Wakh\u00e1\u014b In\u00e1\u017ei\u014b Wi\u014b (Stands Sacred), who married at [[Fort Snelling]] in 1830.<ref name=Ruoff>[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/studies_in_american_indian_literatures/v017/17.2ruoff.html A. LaVonne Brown Ruoff, \"Eastman's Maternal Ancestry\"], ''Studies in American Indian Literature'', Series 2, Vol. 17, No.2, Summer 2005, accessed 4 April 2011.</ref> This post later developed as [[Minneapolis]]. Stands Sacred was the fifteen-year-old daughter of [[Cloud Man]], a Santee Dakota chief of French and [[Mdewakanton]] descent.<ref name=Ruoff/> Seth Eastman was reassigned from Fort Snelling in 1832, soon after the birth of Winona. Winona was later called Wakantakawin.\n\nIn the Dakota tradition of naming to mark life passages, Hakadah was later named '''Oh\u00edye S'a''' ([[Dakota language|Dakota]]: \"always wins\"). He had three older brothers (John, David, and James) and an older sister Mary. During the [[Dakota War of 1862]], Oh\u00edye S'a was separated from his father Wak-anhdi Ota and siblings, and they were thought to have died. His maternal grandmother Stands Sacred (Wakh\u00e1\u014b In\u00e1\u017ei\u014b Wi\u014b) and her family took the boy with them as they fled from the warfare into [[North Dakota]] and [[Manitoba]], Canada.<ref name=Clark/>\n\nFifteen years later Oh\u00edyesa was reunited with his father and oldest brother John in [[South Dakota]]. The father had [[religious conversion|converted]] to Christianity, after which he took the name of Jacob Eastman. John also converted and took the surname Eastman. The Eastman family established a homestead in [[Dakota Territory]]. When Ohiyesa accepted Christianity, he took the name Charles Alexander Eastman.\n\nHis father strongly supported his sons getting an education in European-American style schools. Eastman and his older brother John attended [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] then a preparatory school, Kimball Union Academy from 1882-1883, and college. Eastman first attended [[Beloit College]] and [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox]] colleges; he graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1887. He went on to medical school at [[Boston University]], where he graduated in 1889 and was among the first Native Americans to be certified as a European-style doctor.\n\nHis older brother became a minister. Rev. John (''Ma\u021fpiyawaku Kida'') Eastman was a [[Presbyterian]] [[missionary]] at the Santee Dakota settlement of [[Flandreau, South Dakota]].\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa).jpg|350px|thumbnail|left|Dr. Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa)]]\n\nCharles Eastman worked as an agency physician for the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) [[Indian Health Service]] on the [[Pine Ridge Reservation]] and later at the [[Crow Creek Reservation]], both in [[South Dakota]]. He cared for Indians after the [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] massacre. He later established a private medical practice after being forced out of his position, but was not able to make it succeed.\n\nAs they were struggling financially, his European-American wife, [[Elaine Goodale Eastman]], encouraged him to write some of the stories of his childhood. At her suggestion (and with her editing help), he published the first two in 1893 and 1894 in ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]''. It had earlier published poetry of hers.<ref name=Alexander1/> These stories were collected in his first book.\n\nBetween 1894 and 1898, Eastman established 32 Indian groups of [[YMCA]], and established leadership programs and outdoor youth camps. In 1899, he helped recruit students for the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in [[Pennsylvania]], which had been established as the first Indian boarding school run by the federal government.\n\nIn 1902, Eastman published a memoir, ''Indian Boyhood'', recounting his first fifteen years of life among the Dakota Sioux during the later years of the nineteenth century. In the following two decades, he wrote ten more books, most concerned with his Native American culture. In the early 20th century, he was \"one of the most prolific authors and speakers on Sioux ethnohistory and American Indian affairs.\"<ref name=Ruoff/>\n\nAccording Ruth Ann Alexander, Elaine is not given enough credit although she worked intensively on Charles's stories  as way to share his life and use her literary talent as both his typist and editor.<ref name=Alexander1/> Carol Lea Clark claims that the books should be seen as a collaboration: \"Together they produced works of a public popularity that neither could produce separately.\"<ref name=Clark>Carol Lea Clark, \"Charles A. Eastman (Ohiseya) and Elaine Goodale Eastman: A Cross-Cultural Collaboration\", ''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'', 1994, {{jstor|464110}}, accessed 3 February 2011</ref> These views, however, are contested by other Eastman scholars because of their bias toward a European American influence in his publications. Some of these assumptions are based the fact that Eastman stopped publishing in the years following  the couple\u2019s separation. \n\nWhile it is plausible that Elaine may have helped Eastman edit his work, Ruth J. Heflin argues that Elaine's later claims that she actually wrote his works ring false, as she did not come forward with until after Eastman's death.<ref>Heflin, pp.&nbsp;53\u201358</ref> However, it can be more safely assumed that Elaine was her husband's typist; Eastman apparently did not learn to type, and was reported to have lost his government position because he could not type his reports. \n\nSome of Eastman's books were translated into [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and other European languages, and sold well enough to undergo regular reprints. More recently, a selection of his writings was published as ''[[The Essential Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa)]]'' (2007).\n\nInspired by his writings, [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] sought Eastman's counsel in forming the [[Woodcraft Indians]], which became a popular group for boys. [[YMCA of Greater New York|New York YMCA]] asked both Seton and Eastman to help them design YMCA Indian Scouts for urban boys, using [[Roof garden|rooftop gardens]] and city parks for their activities. In 1910, Seton invited Eastman to work with him and [[Daniel Carter Beard]], of the [[Sons of Daniel Boone]], to found the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA).<ref name=\"Essential\">{{Cite book | last = Eastman | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Eastman |author2=Michael Oren Fitzgerald | title = The essential Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa): light on the Indian world | publisher = World Wisdom | year = 2007 | pages = | url =https://books.google.com/?id=i5JZ3FAKVqcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=universal%20races%20congress&f=false |isbn = 978-1-933316-33-8}}</ref> [[Luther Gulick (physician)|Luther Gulick]] also consulted with Eastman to assist him and his wife Charlotte to develop the [[Camp Fire Girls]].\n\nWith his fame as an author and lecturer, Eastman promoted the fledgling Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls. He advised them on how to organize their summer camps, and directly managed one of the first Boy Scout camps along the shores of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. His daughter, Irene, worked as a counselor at a Camp Fire Girl camp in [[Pittsburgh]]. In 1915, the Eastman family organized their own summer camp at [[Granite Lake (New Hampshire)|Granite Lake]], [[New Hampshire]], where the whole family worked for years.<ref name=Alexander1/> Charles served as a BSA national councilman for many years.<ref name=\"Essential\" />\n\n===National spokesman===\nIn 1911, Eastman was chosen to represent the American Indian at the [[Universal Races Congress]] in London.<ref name=\"Essential\" /> Throughout his speeches and teachings, he emphasized the importance of seeking peace and living in harmony with nature.\n\nHe was active in national politics, particularly in matters dealing with [[Native American civil rights|Indian rights]]. He served as a [[Lobbying|lobbyist]] for the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] between 1894 and 1897. \n\nIn 1903, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] assigned Eastman the job of help Sioux (Dakota, Nakota, Lakota) tribal members  to choose [[English name|English legal names]] to prevent individuals and families from losing allotted lands due to confusion over cultural naming conventions and spellings. Eastman was one of the co-founders of the [[Society of American Indians]] (SAI), which pushed for freedom and [[self-determination]] for the American Indian. From 1923 to 1925, Eastman served as an appointed US Indian inspector under President [[Calvin Coolidge]].\n\nThe [[Calvin Coolidge]] administration (1923-1929) invited Eastman to the [[Committee of 100 (United States)|Committee of 100]], a reform panel examining federal institutions and activities dealing with Indian nations. The committee recommended that the government conduct an in-depth investigation into [[Indian reservation|reservation life]] (health, education, economics, justice, civil rights, etc.). This was commissioned through the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of Interior]] and conducted by the [[Brookings Institution]], resulting in the groundbreaking 1928 ''[[Meriam Report]]''. The findings and recommendations served as the basis of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration's [[New Deal]] for the Indian, including the 1934 [[Indian Reorganization Act]], which encouraged tribes to establish self-government according to constitutional models.\n\nIn 1925, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] asked Eastman to investigate the death and burial location of [[Sacagawea]], the young woman who guided and interpreted for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1805. He determined that she died of old age at the [[Wind River Indian Reservation]] in [[Wyoming]] on April 9, 1884. More recently discovered contemporary records, however, have led modern historians to believe that Sacagewea actually died in 1812 as a result of an illness following childbirth at [[Fort Lisa (North Dakota)]].<ref name=Drumm>Drumm, Stella M., ed.

''Journal of a Fur-trading Expedition on the Upper Missouri: John Luttig, 1812\u20131813'', St. Louis: Missouri Historical Society.</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1891, Eastman married the poet and Indian welfare activist [[Elaine Goodale]], who was serving as Superintendent of Indian Education for the Two Dakotas. She had first taught at [[Hampton Institute]], which then had about 100 Native American students, in addition to African Americans, and at an Indian day school in South Dakota. She supported expanding day schools on reservations for education, rather than sending Native American children away from their families to boarding schools.\n\nThe Eastmans had six children together: five daughters and a son. The marriage prospered at first, and Elaine was always interested in Indian issues. Eastman's many jobs, failure to provide financially for the family, and absences on the lecture circuit, put increasing strain on the couple.<ref name=Alexander1>[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1370&context=greatplainsquarterly Ruth Ann Alexander, \"Elaine Goodale Eastman and the Failure of the Feminist Protestant Ethic\"], ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Spring 1988, accessed 3 February 2011</ref> In 1903, at Elaine's request, they returned to [[Massachusetts]], where the family was based in Amherst.<ref name=Alexander1/>\n\nCharles was traveling extensively, and Elaine Eastman took over managing his public appearances. He lectured about twenty-five times a year across the country. These were productive years for their literary collaboration; he published eight books and she published three. She and Charles separated around 1921, following the death of their daughter Irene in 1918 from [[influenza]] during the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. They never divorced or publicly acknowledged the separation.<ref name=Alexander1/>\n\nTheodore Sargent, a recent biographer of Goodale, noted that Eastman gained acclaim for the nine books he published on Sioux life, whereas Elaine Eastman's seven books received little notice.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&context=greatplainsquarterly Ruth Ann Alexander, \"Review: Theodore D.

He wintered in Detroit, Michigan with his only son Charles, Jr., also called Ohiyesa. On January 8, 1939 the senior Eastman died from a heart attack in Detroit at age eighty. His interment was at Evergreen Cemetery.\n\nElaine Goodale Eastman was close to two daughters and families who lived in Massachusetts. Another lived in New Hampshire.

After working as a physician on reservations in South Dakota, he became increasingly active in politics and issues on [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] rights, he worked to improve the lives of youths, and founded thirty-two Native American chapters<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Indian History of American Institution|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=https://books.google.com/books?id=CNLMam3j_48C&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=thirty-two+Native+American+chapters+of+YMCA&source=bl&ots=GausWsMNA7&sig=ACfU3U13G1lTb_rUTh_G7sfP3JMIsDBV0A&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjx6I2f4tblAhWwGTQIHQNQAcoQ6AEwAXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=thirty-two%20Native%20American%20chapters%20of%20YMCA&f=false|pages=}}</ref> of [[YMCA]]. He also helped found the [[Boy Scouts of America]]. He is considered the first Native American author to write American history from the Native American point of view.\n\n==Early life and education==\nEastman was named '''Hakadah''' at his birth in Minnesota; his name meant \"pitiful last\" in [[Dakota language|Dakota]]. Eastman was so named because his mother died following his birth. He was the last of five children of ''Wakantakawin,'' a [[mixed-race]] woman also known as Winona (meaning \"First-Born Daughter\" in the Dakota language) or Mary Nancy Eastman.<ref name=Ruoff/> She and Eastman's father, a Santee Dakota named Wak-anhdi Ota (Many Lightnings), lived on a Santee Dakota reservation near [[Redwood Falls, Minnesota]].\n\nWinona was the only child of [[Seth Eastman]], a U.S. Army officer and illustrator, and Wakh\u00e1\u014b In\u00e1\u017ei\u014b Wi\u014b (Stands Sacred), who married at [[Fort Snelling]] in 1830.<ref name=Ruoff>[http://muse.jhu.edu/login?auth=0&type=summary&url=/journals/studies_in_american_indian_literatures/v017/17.2ruoff.html A. LaVonne Brown Ruoff, \"Eastman's Maternal Ancestry\"], ''Studies in American Indian Literature'', Series 2, Vol. 17, No.2, Summer 2005, accessed 4 April 2011.</ref> This post later developed as [[Minneapolis]]. Stands Sacred was the fifteen-year-old daughter of [[Cloud Man]], a Santee Dakota chief of French and [[Mdewakanton]] descent.<ref name=Ruoff/> Seth Eastman was reassigned from Fort Snelling in 1832, soon after the birth of Winona. Winona was later called Wakantakawin.\n\nIn the Dakota tradition of naming to mark life passages, Hakadah was later named '''Oh\u00edye S'a''' ([[Dakota language|Dakota]]: \"always wins\"). He had three older brothers (John, David, and James) and an older sister Mary. During the [[Dakota War of 1862]], Oh\u00edye S'a was separated from his father Wak-anhdi Ota and siblings, and they were thought to have died. His maternal grandmother Stands Sacred (Wakh\u00e1\u014b In\u00e1\u017ei\u014b Wi\u014b) and her family took the boy with them as they fled from the warfare into [[North Dakota]] and [[Manitoba]], Canada.<ref name=Clark/>\n\nFifteen years later Oh\u00edyesa was reunited with his father and oldest brother John in [[South Dakota]]. The father had [[religious conversion|converted]] to Christianity, after which he took the name of Jacob Eastman. John also converted and took the surname Eastman. The Eastman family established a homestead in [[Dakota Territory]]. When Ohiyesa accepted Christianity, he took the name Charles Alexander Eastman.\n\nHis father strongly supported his sons getting an education in European-American style schools. Eastman and his older brother John attended [[Mission (Christian)|mission]] then a preparatory school, Kimball Union Academy from 1882-1883, and college. Eastman first attended [[Beloit College]] and [[Knox College (Illinois)|Knox]] colleges; he graduated from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1887. He went on to medical school at [[Boston University]], where he graduated in 1889 and was among the first Native Americans to be certified as a European-style doctor.\n\nHis older brother became a minister. Rev. John (''Ma\u021fpiyawaku Kida'') Eastman was a [[Presbyterian]] [[missionary]] at the Santee Dakota settlement of [[Flandreau, South Dakota]].\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa).jpg|350px|thumbnail|left|Dr. Charles A. Eastman (Ohiyesa)]]\n\nCharles Eastman worked as an agency physician for the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] (BIA) [[Indian Health Service]] on the [[Pine Ridge Reservation]] and later at the [[Crow Creek Reservation]], both in [[South Dakota]]. He cared for Indians after the [[Wounded Knee Massacre|Wounded Knee]] massacre. He later established a private medical practice after being forced out of his position, but was not able to make it succeed.\n\nAs they were struggling financially, his European-American wife, [[Elaine Goodale Eastman]], encouraged him to write some of the stories of his childhood. At her suggestion (and with her editing help), he published the first two in 1893 and 1894 in ''[[St. Nicholas Magazine]]''. It had earlier published poetry of hers.<ref name=Alexander1/> These stories were collected in his first book.\n\nBetween 1894 and 1898, Eastman established 32 Indian groups of [[YMCA]], and established leadership programs and outdoor youth camps. In 1899, he helped recruit students for the [[Carlisle Indian Industrial School]] in [[Pennsylvania]], which had been established as the first Indian boarding school run by the federal government.\n\nIn 1902, Eastman published a memoir, ''Indian Boyhood'', recounting his first fifteen years of life among the Dakota Sioux during the later years of the nineteenth century. In the following two decades, he wrote ten more books, most concerned with his Native American culture. In the early 20th century, he was \"one of the most prolific authors and speakers on Sioux ethnohistory and American Indian affairs.\"<ref name=Ruoff/>\n\nAccording Ruth Ann Alexander, Elaine is not given enough credit although she worked intensively on Charles's stories  as way to share his life and use her literary talent as both his typist and editor.<ref name=Alexander1/> Carol Lea Clark claims that the books should be seen as a collaboration: \"Together they produced works of a public popularity that neither could produce separately.\"<ref name=Clark>Carol Lea Clark, \"Charles A. Eastman (Ohiseya) and Elaine Goodale Eastman: A Cross-Cultural Collaboration\", ''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'', 1994, {{jstor|464110}}, accessed 3 February 2011</ref> These views, however, are contested by other Eastman scholars because of their bias toward a European American influence in his publications. Some of these assumptions are based the fact that Eastman stopped publishing in the years following  the couple\u2019s separation. \n\nWhile it is plausible that Elaine may have helped Eastman edit his work, Ruth J. Heflin argues that Elaine's later claims that she actually wrote his works ring false, as she did not come forward with until after Eastman's death.<ref>Heflin, pp.&nbsp;53\u201358</ref> However, it can be more safely assumed that Elaine was her husband's typist; Eastman apparently did not learn to type, and was reported to have lost his government position because he could not type his reports. \n\nSome of Eastman's books were translated into [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and other European languages, and sold well enough to undergo regular reprints. More recently, a selection of his writings was published as ''[[The Essential Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa)]]'' (2007).\n\nInspired by his writings, [[Ernest Thompson Seton]] sought Eastman's counsel in forming the [[Woodcraft Indians]], which became a popular group for boys. [[YMCA of Greater New York|New York YMCA]] asked both Seton and Eastman to help them design YMCA Indian Scouts for urban boys, using [[Roof garden|rooftop gardens]] and city parks for their activities. In 1910, Seton invited Eastman to work with him and [[Daniel Carter Beard]], of the [[Sons of Daniel Boone]], to found the [[Boy Scouts of America]] (BSA).<ref name=\"Essential\">{{Cite book | last = Eastman | first = Charles | authorlink = Charles Eastman |author2=Michael Oren Fitzgerald | title = The essential Charles Eastman (Ohiyesa): light on the Indian world | publisher = World Wisdom | year = 2007 | pages = | url =https://books.google.com/?id=i5JZ3FAKVqcC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=universal%20races%20congress&f=false |isbn = 978-1-933316-33-8}}</ref> [[Luther Gulick (physician)|Luther Gulick]] also consulted with Eastman to assist him and his wife Charlotte to develop the [[Camp Fire Girls]].\n\nWith his fame as an author and lecturer, Eastman promoted the fledgling Boy Scouts and Camp Fire Girls. He advised them on how to organize their summer camps, and directly managed one of the first Boy Scout camps along the shores of the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. His daughter, Irene, worked as a counselor at a Camp Fire Girl camp in [[Pittsburgh]]. In 1915, the Eastman family organized their own summer camp at [[Granite Lake (New Hampshire)|Granite Lake]], [[New Hampshire]], where the whole family worked for years.<ref name=Alexander1/> Charles served as a BSA national councilman for many years.<ref name=\"Essential\" />\n\n===National spokesman===\nIn 1911, Eastman was chosen to represent the American Indian at the [[Universal Races Congress]] in London.<ref name=\"Essential\" /> Throughout his speeches and teachings, he emphasized the importance of seeking peace and living in harmony with nature.\n\nHe was active in national politics, particularly in matters dealing with [[Native American civil rights|Indian rights]]. He served as a [[Lobbying|lobbyist]] for the [[Dakota people|Dakota]] between 1894 and 1897. \n\nIn 1903, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] assigned Eastman the job of help Sioux (Dakota, Nakota, Lakota) tribal members  to choose [[English name|English legal names]] to prevent individuals and families from losing allotted lands due to confusion over cultural naming conventions and spellings. Eastman was one of the co-founders of the [[Society of American Indians]] (SAI), which pushed for freedom and [[self-determination]] for the American Indian. From 1923 to 1925, Eastman served as an appointed US Indian inspector under President [[Calvin Coolidge]].\n\nThe [[Calvin Coolidge]] administration (1923-1929) invited Eastman to the [[Committee of 100]], a reform panel examining federal institutions and activities dealing with Indian nations. The committee recommended that the government conduct an in-depth investigation into [[Indian reservation|reservation life]] (health, education, economics, justice, civil rights, etc.). This was commissioned through the [[Department of Interior]] and conducted by the [[Brookings Institution]], resulting in the groundbreaking 1928 ''[[Meriam Report]]''. The findings and recommendations served as the basis of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] administration's [[New Deal]] for the Indian, including the 1934 [[Indian Reorganization Act]], which encouraged tribes to establish self-government according to constitutional models.\n\nIn 1925, the [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] asked Eastman to investigate the death and burial location of [[Sacagawea]], the young woman who guided and interpreted for the [[Lewis and Clark Expedition]] in 1805. He determined that she died of old age at the [[Wind River Indian Reservation]] in [[Wyoming]] on April 9, 1884. More recently discovered contemporary records, however, have led modern historians to believe that Sacagewea actually died in 1812 as a result of an illness following childbirth at [[Fort Lisa (North Dakota)]].<ref name=Drumm>Drumm, Stella M., ed.

She had first taught at [[Hampton Institute]], which then had about 100 Native American students, in addition to African Americans, and at an Indian day school in South Dakota. She supported expanding day schools on reservations for education, rather than sending Native American children away from their families to boarding schools.\n\nThe Eastmans had six children together: five daughters and a son. The marriage prospered at first, and Elaine was always interested in Indian issues. Eastman's many jobs, failure to provide financially for the family, and absences on the lecture circuit, put increasing strain on the couple.<ref name=Alexander1>[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1370&context=greatplainsquarterly Ruth Ann Alexander, \"Elaine Goodale Eastman and the Failure of the Feminist Protestant Ethic\"], ''Great Plains Quarterly'', Spring 1988, accessed 3 February 2011</ref> In 1903, at Elaine's request, they returned to [[Massachusetts]], where the family was based in Amherst.<ref name=Alexander1/>\n\nCharles was traveling extensively, and Elaine Eastman took over managing his public appearances. He lectured about twenty-five times a year across the country. These were productive years for their literary collaboration; he published eight books and she published three. She and Charles separated around 1921, following the death of their daughter Irene in 1918 from [[influenza]] during the [[1918 flu pandemic]]. They never divorced or publicly acknowledged the separation.<ref name=Alexander1/>\n\nTheodore Sargent, a recent biographer of Goodale, noted that Eastman gained acclaim for the nine books he published on Sioux life, whereas Elaine Eastman's seven books received little notice.<ref>[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1084&context=greatplainsquarterly Ruth Ann Alexander, \"Review: Theodore D.

Although the rumor was said to have been untrue, the couple did not reconcile.<ref name=Alexander1/>\n\n==Later life==\nCharles Eastman built a cabin on the eastern shore of [[Lake Huron]], where he spent his later-year summers. He wintered in Detroit, Michigan with his only son Charles, Jr., also called Ohiyesa. On January 8, 1939 the senior Eastman died from a heart attack in Detroit at age eighty. His interment was at Evergreen Cemetery.\n\nElaine Goodale Eastman was close to two daughters and families who lived in Massachusetts. Another lived in New Hampshire. Goodale Eastman died in 1953 and was buried in Northampton.<ref name=Alexander1/>\n\n==Legacy and honors==\n* As a child, Ohiyesa had learned about herbal medicine from his grandmother.
