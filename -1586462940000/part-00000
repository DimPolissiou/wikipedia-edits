Sonia represented her homeland in Japan with the title of [[Miss Bolivia]] International 1988.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://misses-bolivia.blogspot.com/2013/07/sonia-montero-de-falcone-miss-bolivia.html|title=Sonia Montero de Falcone, miss Bolivia Internacional 1988 y hoy artista contempor\u00e1nea {{!}} Misses de Bolivia|date=2013-07-07|website=Sonia Montero de Falcone, miss Bolivia Internacional 1988 y hoy artista contempor\u00e1nea {{!}} Misses de Bolivia|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> She is an activist for health and education, a supporter and promoter of children's rights, and protector of women who suffered domestic violence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}}\n\n== Artistic career ==\nFalcone was invited as a volunteer by the [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]] Center for the Arts Museum ([[Arizona]], [[United States]]) and devoted her time to community projects related to and in support of art: improvement and maintenance of the opera, theatre, and the Museum of the city. As a member of the Board, she promoted the involvement of marginalized Latino communities to arts-related tasks. She is the founder of [[Essant\u00e9 Corporation]], a multinational entity established specifically for people seeking better health and greater opportunities in their lives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}}\n\nFalcone exhibited her work in [[La Paz]] (Nota Gallery) in July 2010{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]] (Lorca Gallery) in September 2010{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} - [[Bolivia]], in PINTA [[New York City]] (December 2010), [[Miami International Art Fair]] <ref>[http://mia-artfair.com/press_articles/releases/print/mia_release_features.pdf Press Article in mia-artfair.com ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821212926/http://mia-artfair.com/press_articles/releases/print/mia_release_features.pdf |date=2011-08-21 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/best-art-from-miami-international-art-fair-6489236|title=Best Art From Miami International Art Fair|last=McCorquodale|first=Amanda|date=2011-01-14|website=Miami New Times|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> (January 2011) and from June 6, in PINTA <ref>[http://www.undo.net/it/mostra/121216 Article in www.undu.net]</ref>[[London]] (June 2011).\n\nIn these exhibitions, Falcone manifests another phase of her personality with her most well-known work \"Windows of the Soul\", revealing elements that reflect her life experience. Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].  She has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Phoenix, [[Calvin Charles Gallery]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and \"The Gallery\" in [[Cabo

to paint.

As a member of the Board, she promoted the involvement of marginalized Latino communities to arts-related tasks. She is the founder of [[Essant\u00e9 Corporation]], a multinational entity established specifically for people seeking better health and greater opportunities in their lives.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}}\n\nFalcone exhibited her work in [[La Paz]] (Nota Gallery) in July 2010{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra|Santa Cruz]] (Lorca Gallery) in September 2010{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} - [[Bolivia]], in PINTA [[New York City]] (December 2010), [[Miami International Art Fair]] <ref>[http://mia-artfair.com/press_articles/releases/print/mia_release_features.pdf Press Article in mia-artfair.com ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110821212926/http://mia-artfair.com/press_articles/releases/print/mia_release_features.pdf |date=2011-08-21 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.miaminewtimes.com/arts/best-art-from-miami-international-art-fair-6489236|title=Best Art From Miami International Art Fair|last=McCorquodale|first=Amanda|date=2011-01-14|website=Miami New Times|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref> (January 2011) and from June 6, in PINTA <ref>[http://www.undo.net/it/mostra/121216 Article in www.undu.net]</ref>[[London]] (June 2011).\n\nIn these exhibitions, Falcone manifests another phase of her personality with her most well-known work \"Windows of the Soul\", revealing elements that reflect her life experience. Spirituality is a central element in her work. Her spiritual ideal can be found in all structures, cosmic or individual, organic or inorganic, but achieves its full expression in the human form, shown in her monumental multicolored pieces, with rainbows, snow-capped peaks of the Andes, shadows that banish sunrises, the construction of a world with llamas and fish and where, living the art of war, the sun of justice rose and the drops of blood became art and poetry.\n\nVideo Art Installation, a major piece of this artist, participated in the XVII Bienal de Arte de [[Santa Cruz de la Sierra]], where Sonia was invited to participate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.my-bolivia.com/best-video-installation-art-at-the-biennale-in-santa-cruz-bolivia-by-sonia-falcone/|title=Best Video Installation Art at the Biennale in Santa Cruz Bolivia by SONIA FALCONE|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the [[3rd millennium|third millennium]], after receiving an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from Trinity College of Graduate Studies <ref>[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Businesswoman-Philanthropist+Sonia+Falcone+to+Receive+Honorary...-a075602619 PR Newswire June 18 2001]</ref> in \"Spirituality and Psychology\", she joined her social and artistic work, viewing art as a tool that could be used not only to understand people's problems, but also to help them think.\n\n\"Passions of the Soul\", one of her most recent works, achieves a rapport between art and game, trying to reach the adult and the child within by creating metaphors that express a philosophy of life.\n\nFalcone's work has appeared in several collectives, mainly in [[Phoenix City Government Convention Center]]\u2013 Civic Plaza, invited by the [[National Hispanic Woman Corporation]].  She has had solo exhibitions at the Museum of Phoenix, [[Calvin Charles Gallery]] in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]],{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason=citation required}} and \"The Gallery\" in [[Cabo

After learning of the regular sequence discovered by the German astronomer and mathematician [[Johann Daniel Titius|J.D. Titius (1729\u20131796)]], astronomer [[Johann Elert Bode|Johann E. Bode]] urged a search for the fifth planet corresponding to a gap in the sequence. [[1 Ceres|(1)&nbsp;Ceres]], the largest [[asteroid]] in the asteroid belt (now considered a [[dwarf planet]]), was serendipitously discovered in 1801 by the Italian [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] and found to closely match the \"empty\" position in [[Titius\u2013Bode law|Titius' sequence]], which led many to believe it to be the \"missing planet\". However, in 1802 [[astronomer]] [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Heinrich W.M. Olbers]] discovered and named the asteroid [[2 Pallas|(2)&nbsp;Pallas]], a second object in roughly the same orbit as (1)&nbsp;Ceres.\n\n[[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Olbers]] proposed that these two discoveries were the fragments of a [[disrupted planet]] that had formerly orbited the Sun, and predicted that more of these pieces would be found. The discovery of the asteroid [[3 Juno|(3)&nbsp;Juno]] by [[Karl Ludwig Harding]] and [[4 Vesta|(4)&nbsp;Vesta]] by Olbers, buttressed his hypothesis.\n\nIn 1823, German linguist and retired teacher <!--[[Johann Gottlieb Radlof|-->J.G. Radlof<!--]]--> called Olbers' destroyed planet ''Pha\u00ebthon'', linking it to the [[Greek myths and legends]] about [[Phaethon]] and others.<ref>{{cite book |last=Radlof |first=Johann Gottlieb |title=Zertr\u00fcmmerung der gro\u00dfen Planeten Hesperus und Phaeton, und darauf folgenden Zerst\u00f6rungen und Ueberflutung auf der Erde |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qRI5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA59 |year=1823 |publisher=G.

This theory states that there was once a major planetary member of our [[Solar System]] circulating in the present gap between Mars and Jupiter, which was destroyed by one or more of the following hypothetical processes:\n* it veered too close to Jupiter and was torn apart by its powerful tides\n* it was struck by another large celestial body\n* it was destroyed by a hypothetical [[brown dwarf]], the companion star to the [[Sun]], known as [[Nemesis (hypothetical star)|Nemesis]]\n* it was shattered by some internal catastrophe\n\nIn 1953, Soviet Russian astronomer I. I. Putilin suggested that Phaeton was destroyed due to centrifugal forces, giving it a diameter of approximately 6 880 kilometers and a rotational speed of 2.6 hours. Eventually, the planet became so distorted that parts of it near its equator were spun off into space. [[Outgassing]] of gases once stored in Phaeton's interior caused multiple explosions, sending material into space and forming [[Asteroid family|asteroid families]]. However, his theory was not widely accepted. Two years later in 1955, [[Odessa|Odessan]] astronomer K. N. Savchenko suggested that Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta were not fragments of Phaeton, but rather its former moons. Phaeton had an additional fifth satellite, assumed to be the size of Ceres, orbiting near the planet's [[Hill sphere]], and thus more subject to gravitational perturbations from Jupiter. As a result, the fifth satellite became tidally detached and orbited the Sun for millions of years afterward, making periodic close misses with Phaeton that slowly increased its velocity. Once the escaped satellite re-entered Phaeton's Hill sphere, it collided with the planet at high speed, shattering it while Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta assumed heliocentric orbits. Simulations showed that for such a Ceres-sized body to shatter Phaeton, it would need to be travelling at nearly 20 kilometers per second.<ref name=\"originoftheasteroids\"/>\n\nThe disrupted planet hypothesis has also been supported by French-Italian mathematician and astronomer [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]];<ref>{{cite book |author=Lagrange, J.L. |year=1814 |title=Sur l'origine des com\u00e8tes-Connaissance des temps pour l'an 1814 |page=211}}</ref> Canadian geologist Reginald Daly in 1943;<ref>{{cite book |author=Dodd, Robert |year=1986 |title=Thunderstones and Shooting Stars |page=54 |publisher=Harvard U.

The hypothetical planet was named for [[Phaethon]], the son of the sun god [[Helios]] in [[Greek mythology]], who attempted to drive his father's solar chariot for a day with disastrous results and was ultimately destroyed by [[Zeus]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Pha\u00ebthon |volume=21 |page=342}}</ref>\n\n==Phaeton hypothesis==\n\n[[file:Sturz des Phaeton, Deckengem\u00e4lde von Johann Michael Franz in Eichst\u00e4tt.jpg|thumb|''Sturz des Phaeton'' (Fall of the Phaeton) by Johann Michael Franz]]\n[[file:Heinrich Wilhelm Olbers.jpg|thumb|upright|Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers, who formulated the planet Phaeton hypothesis]]\nAccording to the now-discredited [[Titius\u2013Bode law]], a planet was believed to exist between Mars and Jupiter. After learning of the regular sequence discovered by the German astronomer and mathematician [[Johann Daniel Titius|J.D. Titius (1729\u20131796)]], astronomer [[Johann Elert Bode|Johann E. Bode]] urged a search for the fifth planet corresponding to a gap in the sequence. [[1 Ceres|(1)&nbsp;Ceres]], the largest [[asteroid]] in the asteroid belt (now considered a [[dwarf planet]]), was serendipitously discovered in 1801 by the Italian [[Giuseppe Piazzi]] and found to closely match the \"empty\" position in [[Titius\u2013Bode law|Titius' sequence]], which led many to believe it to be the \"missing planet\". However, in 1802 [[astronomer]] [[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Heinrich W.M. Olbers]] discovered and named the asteroid [[2 Pallas|(2)&nbsp;Pallas]], a second object in roughly the same orbit as (1)&nbsp;Ceres.\n\n[[Heinrich Wilhelm Matth\u00e4us Olbers|Olbers]] proposed that these two discoveries were the fragments of a [[disrupted planet]] that had formerly orbited the Sun, and predicted that more of these pieces would be found. The discovery of the asteroid [[3 Juno|(3)&nbsp;Juno]] by [[Karl Ludwig Harding]] and [[4 Vesta|(4)&nbsp;Vesta]] by Olbers, buttressed his hypothesis.\n\nIn 1823, German linguist and retired teacher <!--[[Johann Gottlieb Radlof|-->J.G. Radlof<!--]]--> called Olbers' destroyed planet ''Pha\u00ebthon'', linking it to the [[Greek myths and legends]] about [[Phaethon]] and others.<ref>{{cite book |last=Radlof |first=Johann Gottlieb |title=Zertr\u00fcmmerung der gro\u00dfen Planeten Hesperus und Phaeton, und darauf folgenden Zerst\u00f6rungen und Ueberflutung auf der Erde |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qRI5AAAAcAAJ&pg=PA59 |year=1823 |publisher=G.

This theory states that there was once a major planetary member of our [[Solar System]] circulating in the present gap between Mars and Jupiter, which was destroyed by one or more of the following hypothetical processes:\n* it veered too close to Jupiter and was torn apart by its powerful tides\n* it was struck by another large celestial body\n* it was destroyed by a hypothetical [[brown dwarf]], the companion star to the [[Sun]], known as [[Nemesis (hypothetical star)|Nemesis]]\n* it was shattered by some internal catastrophe\n\nIn 1953, Soviet Russian astronomer I. I. Putilin suggested that Phaeton was destroyed due to centrifugal forces, giving it a diameter of approximately 6 880 kilometers and a rotational speed of 2.6 hours. Eventually, the planet became so distorted that parts of it near its equator were spun off into space. [[Outgassing]] of gases once stored in Phaeton's interior caused multiple explosions, sending material into space and forming [[Asteroid family|asteroid families]]. However, his theory was not widely accepted. Two years later in 1955, [[Odessa|Odessan]] astronomer K. N. Savchenko suggested that Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta were not fragments of Phaeton, but rather its former moons. Phaeton had an additional fifth satellite, assumed to be the size of Ceres, orbiting near the planet's [[Hill sphere]], and thus more subject to gravitational perturbations from Jupiter. As a result, the fifth satellite became tidally detached and orbited the Sun for millions of years afterward, making periodic close misses with Phaeton that slowly increased its velocity. Once the escaped satellite re-entered Phaeton's Hill sphere, it collided with the planet at high speed, shattering it while Ceres, Pallas, Juno, and Vesta assumed heliocentric orbits. Simulations showed that for such a Ceres-sized body to shatter Phaeton, it would need to be travelling at nearly 20 kilometers per second.<ref name=\"originoftheasteroids\"/>\n\nThe disrupted planet hypothesis has also been supported by French-Italian mathematician and astronomer [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]];<ref>{{cite book |author=Lagrange, J.L. |year=1814 |title=Sur l'origine des com\u00e8tes-Connaissance des temps pour l'an 1814 |page=211}}</ref> Canadian geologist Reginald Daly in 1943;<ref>{{cite book |author=Dodd, Robert |year=1986 |title=Thunderstones and Shooting Stars |page=54 |publisher=Harvard U.
