By 1887 the preparatory technical school that would become [[Baku Polytechnicum]] was established in Baku. By 1910 it had integrated a curriculum related to the growing oil industry. However, the ratio of [[Azeri]]s to non-Azeris was so skewed that, of the 494 students studying at the school in 1916, only 20 were Azeri. On November 14, 1920, after the invasion of the [[Red Army]] and the establishment of the fledgling [[Azerbaijan SSR]], the new government decreed that Baku Polytechnicum would close and be replaced by Baku Polytechnical Institute, a more traditional [[Institute of technology|polytechnic institute]] and the beginnings of the current incarnation. The new school focused on training engineers in a broad range of industries, from agriculture to oil. By 1923 the school graduated its first three students; by 1927 it had risen to 289 graduates.\n\nThe new school went through many name changes over the years as its emphasis changed to meet the needs of Azerbaijan. In 1923 the school changed its name to Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute. In 1929 the agriculture department was spun off into a separate Agriculture Institute and the university changed its name to the Azerbaijan Oil Institute (AOI) in 1930. However, the expanding need for engineers in areas outside oil resulted in expansion in the school's curriculum. The school changed names again in 1934, this time to the Azerbaijan Industrial Institute (Az.I.I.).\n\n[[World War II]] taxed the Soviet Union and schools like Az.I.I. struggled to stay open. At the end of the war, there was great demand for oil engineers in the Soviet Union and the school trained them in great numbers. In 1952, the government founded a separate Azerbaijan Polytechnical Institute and moved much of the non-petrochemical curricula to the new school so that Az.I.I. could focus on the oil industry. On February 12, 1959 the school was renamed the Azerbaijan Oil and Chemistry Institute (AzOCI). In the early 1960s an evening program was developed. This program developed into its own, separate public university in 1992, reusing the name Azerbaijan Industrial Institute and becoming [[Sumgait State University]]. On March 21, 1992, after the independence of Azerbaijan from the Soviet Union, the university changed its name to the current ASOIU.\n\nIn 1993 the school changed its curricula into a more Western model, with its first [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[master's degree]] candidates graduating in 1999.\n\nBy the decree of the president, the university was named the Azerbaijan State Oil and Industrial University in 2015.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://president.az/articles/16054|title=Az\u0259rbaycan Prezidentinin R\u0259smi internet s\u0259hif\u0259si - S\u018fN\u018fDL\u018fR \u00bb S\u0259r\u0259ncamlar|website=president.az|language=az|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.asoiu.edu.az/en/page/1-about-asoiu|title=About ASOIU|website=www.asoiu.edu.az|language=en|access-date=2018-10-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Shooting spree ===\n{{Main | Azerbaijan State Oil Academy shootings }}\n\nOn April 30, 2009, [[Azerbaijan State Oil Academy shootings|a shooting spree]] occurred at the academy in which thirteen people were killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8026194.stm Gun attack at Azerbaijan academy], BBC News, April 30, 2009</ref> The perpetrator was [[Farda Gadirov]], a Georgian citizen of Azerbaijani descent.\n\n== Campus ==\nThe campus is on Azadl\u0131q Prospekti (Liberty Avenue) in Baku.\n\n== Organization and administration ==\nThe university is run by a management body of [[prorector]]s, supervised by the Scientific Council and the rector [[Mustafa Babanli]].\n\n== Academic profile ==\nThe Academy has eight faculties \u2013 Geology and Exploration Faculty, Gas, Petroleum and Mining Faculty, Chemical Technologies Faculty, Petro-mechanics Faculty, Energetics Faculty, Automatization of Production Processes Faculty, Engineering Economics, International Economic Relationships and Management Faculty and the Institute for Specialization and Re-education of Workforce for Industrial Organizations.\n\nSince the breakup of the Soviet Union, ASOA has worked with a dozen Western universities to Westernize and modernize its programs, in particular with [[Georgia State University]] to develop a modern [[Master of Business Administration]] program.<ref>Gary McKillips, \"[http://www.robinson.gsu.edu/magazine/fall2001/baku.html Teach a Man to Fish] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901151104/http://www.robinson.gsu.edu/magazine/fall2001/baku.html |date=September 1, 2006 }}\", ''The State of Business'' (Georgia State University), Fall 2001, accessed on April 14, 2006</ref>\n\nASOA trains students in more than 50 fields: geological engineering, computer sciences, metallurgical engineering, hydrogeology engineering, geophysics engineering, mountain-mining engineering, petroleum and gas constructions engineering, heating energetics engineering, equipment production engineering, technology machinery and apparatus engineering, electrical engineering, electronics, communication and radiotechnics engineering, mechatronics and robotechnology engineering, mechanical engineering, information technology and systems engineering, re-manufacturing and repair engineering, metrology, standardization and certification engineering, chemical engineering, petroleum and gas engineering, automatization engineering, management, engineering economics, marketing and so on.\n\n== Awards ==\nIn 1931, the university received \u201cOrder of the Red Banner of Labor of the Azerbaijan SSR\u201d and in 1940, it received \u201cOrder of the Red Banner of Labor\u201d.<ref>Great Soviet Encyclopedia (1926-1990). {{ISBN|978-5-85270-324-8}}, {{ISBNT|978-5-85270-292-0}}</ref>\n\n== Student life ==\n\n=== Sport ===\nThe Academy has its own sports complex with swimming pool, tennis courts and all-weather football pitch.
