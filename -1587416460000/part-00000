While reading ''[[The New York Times]]'', Brian discovers that a [[self-help book]] is the highest-selling book on its [[The New York Times Best Seller list|bestseller list]], and after some persuasion by [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]], decides to write his own in order to prove that self-help books are useless. Finishing it in three hours and titling it ''Wish It, Want It, Do It'', Brian publishes the book, and it immediately becomes a commercial success. Brian decides to hire Stewie (because of his connections that helped publish the book) as his [[publicist]] when the book becomes popular, and organizes a publicity tour. Though Brian is initially skeptical of Stewie's arrogant demeanour, Brian soon follows suit and becomes an egomaniac. While reflecting on his fame during dinner, Brian notices [[Ren\u00e9e Zellweger]] at the front of the restaurant; after angrily berating Stewie for not booking their table there, he punishes him by refusing to give him a lift to their hotel. Seeking to reconcile his relationship with Brian, Stewie books him an appearance on ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'' to discuss [[separation of church and state]] with [[Bill Maher|Maher]] and [[Christopher Hitchens]].\n\nTwo hours prior to his appearance, Brian continues to bully Stewie for insignificant inconveniences, when they are informed that Hitchens cannot attend, and that [[Arianna Huffington]] and [[Dana Gould]] will serve as replacement panelists. Blaming Stewie again, Brian angrily fires him and continues on to the show's panel. While on the show, Maher, Huffington and Gould begin to criticize Brian's book, stating that it fails to meet the expectations of the public and is pretentious, repetitive, unhelpful, banal and manipulative. Brian attempts to defend it by talking down to the panelists, including pettily insulting Huffington's accent and Gould's feminine-sounding first name, but finds himself under pressure from them. In anger and desperation, he insults the panelists for having little sense in literature, but is constantly put down. He ultimately confesses that he too considers the book to be of a low standard, admitting that he wrote it in a day in the hope that it would sell. Maher loses all respect for Brian, stating that a real writer would stand by their work despite what others think. When trying to regain Maher's trust, Brian panics and urinates, prompting Maher to angrily chase him off the set with a newspaper. Humiliated, Brian returns to Quahog and half-heartedly apologizes to Stewie, during which he unsubtly and passive-aggressively continues to blame him for everything that went wrong.

However, there are exceptions to that, as previously Municipality were constituted in urban centers with population over 20,000, so all the urban bodies which were previously classified as Municipality were reclassified as Municipality even if their population was under 100,000. Under the [[Panchayati Raj]] system, it interacts directly with the state government, though it is administratively part of the district it is located in. Generally, smaller district cities and bigger towns have a Municipality. Municipality are also a form of local self-government entrusted with some duties and responsibilities, as enshrined in the [[Seventy-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India|Constitutional (74th Amendment) Act,1992]].\n*In the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], the term was used until the [[1972 Local Government Act]] came into effect in 1974 in [[England]] and [[Wales]], and until 1975 in [[Scotland]] and 1976 in [[Northern Ireland]], \"both for a city or town which is organized for self-government under a municipal corporation, and also for the governing body itself.

However, there are exceptions to that, as previously Municipality were constituted in urban centers with population over 20,000, so all the urban bodies which were previously classified as Municipality were reclassified as Municipality even if their population was under 100,000. Under the [[Panchayati Raj]] system, it interacts directly with the state government, though it is administratively part of the district it is located in. Generally, smaller district cities and bigger towns have a Municipality. Municipality are also a form of local self-government entrusted with some duties and responsibilities, as enshrined in the [[Seventy-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India|Constitutional (74th Amendment) Act,1992]].\n*In the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]], the term was used until the [[1972 Local Government Act]] came into effect in 1974 in [[England]] and [[Wales]], and until 1975 in [[Scotland]] and 1976 in [[Northern Ireland]], \"both for a city or town which is organized for self-government under a municipal corporation, and also for the governing body itself.

Selection of officers for graduate education is fully funded by their service and is based upon outstanding professional performance as an officer, promotion potential, and a strong academic background. Admission of non-Government affiliated civilians is based on academic preparation and requires U.S. citizenship. A substantial number of AFIT graduates are assigned to AFRL and NASIC upon graduation from AFIT. Many of the AFIT student thesis projects are influenced directly or indirectly by AFRL, NASIC, NRO and other Air Force and defense agencies.\n\n=== Faculty ===\nThe faculty body consists of approximately a 50\u201350 mix of military and civilian members all of whom hold a PhD in their fields.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The faculty to student ratio is typically 1 to 6 in the master's degree programs.\n\n=== Accreditation ===\nAFIT is accredited by [[the Higher Learning Commission]] of the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]], 30 North LaSalle Street, Suite 2400, Chicago, Illinois 60602-2504 to offer degrees to the doctorate level. Eight engineering programs in the Graduate School of Engineering and Management are accredited at the advanced level by the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET).\n\n=== Academic calendar ===\nThe Institute operates year-round on a quarter calendar which includes the Fall, Winter, Spring, and Summer terms. The quarters are 10 weeks in length plus a week for examinations. Typically, the Fall term begins in late September and ends in mid-December; the Winter term begins in early January and ends in mid-March; the Spring term begins in late March and ends in mid-June; and the Summer term begins in late June and ends in early-September.\n\n=== Cost ===\nThe educational expenses for full-time military students assigned to AFIT are paid by their respective uniformed service. For tuition-paying students, the approximate cost is $6,420 per quarter for full-time enrollment (based on 12 quarter hours and a tuition rate of $535 per quarter-hour). AFIT is tuition-waived for civilian employees of the Department of Defense.\n\n=== Civilian Institution Programs ===\nThrough its Civilian Institution Programs, AFIT also manages the educational programs of officers enrolled in civilian universities, research centers, hospitals, and industrial organizations. Air Force students attending civilian institutions have earned more than 12,000 undergraduate and graduate degrees in the past twenty years.\n\n== Notable AFIT alumni ==\n* [[George Abbey|George W.S.

Each of these featured a special badge with an identification number mounted next to the gear selector, and were finished with a white exterior, wheels, and interior.<ref name=\"Standard Catalog of Corvette\" /> In 1990, the ZR1 option Corvette was introduced with the LT5 engine designed by Lotus and built in the Mercury Marine plant in Stillwater, Oklahoma. The LT5 engine was a 4 cam (DOHC) design producing 375&nbsp;hp (280&nbsp;kW) when at \"open throttle\". The C4 ZR1 ran from 1990 thru 1995 model years. In 1991, all Corvettes received updates to the body, interior, and wheels. The convex rear fascia that set the 1990 ZR-1 apart from the base model was now included on L98 Corvettes, making the styling of the expensive ZR-1 even closer to that of the base cars. The most obvious difference remaining between the base and ZR-1 models besides the wider rear wheels was the location of the CHMSL, which was integrated into the new rear fascia used on the base model, but remained at the top of the rear-hatch on the ZR-1's.<ref name=\"Corvette Black\" />\n\n[[File:92 Corvette ZR1.jpg|thumb|left|1992 Corvette ZR-1]]\n\nFor the 1992 model year, the {{convert|300|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} [[GM LT engine|LT1]] engine was introduced, an increase of {{convert|50|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} over 1991's L98 engine. This engine featured [[Reverse-flow cylinder head|reverse-flow cooling]] (the heads were cooled before the block), which allowed for a higher compression ratio of 10.5:1. A new distributor was also debuted. Called \"Optispark\", the distributor was driven directly off the front of the camshaft and mounted in front of the timing cover, just above the crankshaft and harmonic balancer.<ref name=\"Corvette Black\" /> Also new for 1992 was Acceleration Slip Regulation (ASR), a form of traction control which utilized the Corvette's brakes, spark retard, and throttle close-down to prevent excessive rear wheel spin and possible loss of control.

Production of the C5 Corvette actually began in 1996 but quality/manufacturing issues saw its release to the public in mass delayed until 1997, and continuing through the 2004 model year.  The C5 was a completely new design that featured many new concepts and manufacturing breakthroughs that would be carried forward to the C6 & C7.  It had a top speed of {{convert|176|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and was judged by the automotive press as a breakthrough with vastly improved dynamics in nearly every area over the previous C4 design.  Innovations included a 0.29 drag coefficient, near 50/50 weight distribution, active handling (the first ever stability control for a Corvette), and electronic power steering assistance.  It also weighed less than the C4.\n\nAn all new LS1 aluminum engine (Gen III small block) featured individual ignition coils for each cylinder, and aluminum block and pistons. It was initially rated at {{convert|345|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}}, but was increased to {{convert|350|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} in the 2001 edition.

One concept for the FRC was for it to be a stripped-down model with a possible V6 engine (nicknamed in-house as the \"Billy Bob\").<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=Richard|title=Corvette C5 performance projects|year=2006|publisher=MBI Pub. |isbn=978-0760320815|page=8}}</ref> By 2000, FRC plans laid the groundwork for the return in 2001 of the Z06, an RPO option not seen since Zora's 1963 race-ready Corvette.<ref>Schefter, pp. 96, 105, 108.</ref>\n\nThe Z06 model replaced the FRC model as the highest performance C5 Corvette. Instead of a heavier double-overhead cam engine like the ZR-1 of the C4 generation, the Z06 used an LS6, a {{convert|385|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} derivative of the standard LS1 engine. Using the much more rigid fixed roof design allowed the Z06 unprecedented handling thanks to upgraded brakes and less body flex.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mueller|first=Mike|title=Essential musclecars|year=2004|publisher=Motorbooks International|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0760319666}}</ref> Those characteristics, along with the use of materials such as a titanium exhaust system and a carbon fiber hood in the 2004 model year, led to further weight savings and performance gains for the C5 Z06. The LS6 was later upgraded to {{convert|405|bhp|kW|abbr=on}}for 2002\u20132004. Although the Z06's rated power output equal to that of the C4 ZR-1, the improved rigidity, suspension, brakes, and reduced weight of the C5 produced a car quicker than C4 ZR-1.<ref>{{cite book|last=Endres|first=Christopher P.|title=Chevy LS1/LS6 performance : high performance modifications for street and racing : covers Chevy LS1 and LS6 engines, 1997 and up |year=1996 |publisher=HP Books|location=New York |isbn=978-1557884077|edition=1st}}</ref>\n\n=== Sixth generation (C6; 2005\u20132013) ===\n{{Main|Chevrolet Corvette (C6)}}\n[[File:Chevrolet Corvette Coup\u00e9 Luxury (C6) \u2013 Frontansicht, 16.

The public immediately saw through the marketing ploy and GM's use of \"simply changing the part numbers\" despite a large number of the parts being interchangeable between the C5 & C6. Car & Driver, along with Motor Trend, quickly noticed the inaccuracy, noting that the C6 was more an \"evolution of the C5, instead of a complete redo\".  This even led C&D to term the C6 as the \"C5 and 11/16ths\". \nTo highlight the new generation, Chevrolet gave the C6 a face lift; reducing the exterior body overhangs for a noticeably overall reduction in outward dimension.  The front headlights were also redone, deleting the traditional \"pop-up\" headlights, opting for a more modern look. Beyond that, the majority of the changes focused on improving the quality of the interior. \nThe C6 has a slightly longer wheelbase than the C5, a change necessitated by the use of a different automatic transmission which resulted in the rear linkage points being relocated; thus presenting a \"longer\" wheelbase.\n\nThe C6 brought a new and improved interior compared to the C5. As a result of the upgraded interior, the C6 had a slight increase in passenger hip room.  It also sported an updated LS1/LS6 engine now called the LS2.  This engine was primarily an LS1/LS6 with a bump in displacement from 5.7L to 6.0 liters. The increased displacement of the 6.0 bumped the LS2's horsepower up by 50 BHP over its LS1 progenitor, although still 5 BHP less than the upgraded LS6 engine found in the previous C5 Z06.  Thus the LS2 was now at 364 cu in, and it produced {{convert|400|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} at 6000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|400|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 4400&nbsp;rpm, giving the vehicle a 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time of under 4.2 seconds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Phil|title=Corvette C6|year=2004|publisher=Motorbooks International|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0760318652}}</ref> Its top speed was {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe C6 generation did not match the previous generation's relatively good [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], despite its relatively low 0.28 [[drag coefficient]] and low curb weight, achieving 16/26 mpg (city/highway) equipped with automatic or manual transmissions; like all manual transmission Corvettes since 1989, it is fitted with Computer Aided Gear Selection (CAGS) to improve fuel economy by requiring drivers to shift from 1st gear directly to 4th in low-speed/low-throttle conditions.

A near-identical body in [[aluminum alloy]] was constructed and became the XP-895 \"Reynolds Aluminum Car.\" Duntov and Mitchell responded with two [[Chevrolet Vega]] (stillborn) [[Wankel engine|Wankel]] 2-rotor engines joined together as a 4-rotor {{convert|420|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine which was used to power the XP-895.

The public immediately saw through the marketing ploy and GM's use of \"simply changing the part numbers\" despite a large number of the parts being interchangeable between the C5 & C6. Car & Driver, along with Motor Trend, quickly noticed the inaccuracy, noting that the C6 was more an \"evolution of the C5, instead of a complete redo\".  This even led C&D to term the C6 as the \"C5 and 11/16ths\". \nTo highlight the new generation, Chevrolet gave the C6 a face lift; reducing the exterior body overhangs for a noticeably overall reduction in outward dimension.  The front headlights were also redone, deleting the traditional \"pop-up\" headlights, opting for a more modern look. Beyond that, the majority of the changes focused on improving the quality of the interior. \nThe C6 has a slightly longer wheelbase than the C5, a change necessitated by the use of a different automatic transmission which resulted in the rear linkage points being relocated; thus presenting a \"longer\" wheelbase.\n\nThe C6 brought a new and improved interior compared to the C5. As a result of the upgraded interior, the C6 had an slight increase in passenger hip room.  It also sported an updated LS1/LS6 engine now called the LS2.  This engine was primarily an LS1/LS6 with a bump in displacement from 5.7L to 6.0 liters. The increased displacement of the 6.0 bumped the LS2's horsepower up by 50 BHP over its LS1 progenitor, although still 5 BHP less than the upgraded LS6 engine found in the previous C5 Z06.  Thus the LS2 was now at 364 cu in, and it produced {{convert|400|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} at 6000&nbsp;rpm and {{convert|400|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 4400&nbsp;rpm, giving the vehicle a 0\u201360&nbsp;mph time of under 4.2 seconds.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berg|first=Phil|title=Corvette C6|year=2004|publisher=Motorbooks International|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=978-0760318652}}</ref> Its top speed was {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe C6 generation did not match the previous generation's relatively good [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]], despite its relatively low 0.28 [[drag coefficient]] and low curb weight, achieving 16/26 mpg (city/highway) equipped with automatic or manual transmissions; like all manual transmission Corvettes since 1989, it is fitted with Computer Aided Gear Selection (CAGS) to improve fuel economy by requiring drivers to shift from 1st gear directly to 4th in low-speed/low-throttle conditions.

It was brought to production in six months with only minor changes.\n\n[[File:1966 Chevrolet Ad-Mako shark II.jpg|thumb|[[Corvette Mako Shark (concept car)|Mako Shark]] II advertisement (1966)]]\n\nHarley Earl's successor, [[Bill Mitchell (designer)|Bill Mitchell]] was the man behind most of the Corvette concepts of the 1960s and 1970s. The second-generation (C2) of 1963 was his, and its design first appeared on the [[Corvette Stingray (concept car)|Stingray Racer]] of 1959. It made its public debut at Maryland's Marlborough Raceway on April 18, 1959, powered by a {{convert|283|cuin|L|abbr=on}} V8 with experimental 11:1 compression aluminum cylinder heads and took fourth place.

In keeping with the name, the streamlining, pointed snout, and other detailing was partly inspired by the look of that very [[Mako shark|fast fish]]. The 1961 Corvette tail was given two additional tail lights (six total) for the concept car. The body inspired the 1963 production Sting Ray.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nIn 1965 Mitchell removed the original concept body and redesigned it as the Mako Shark II. Chevrolet actually created two of them, only one of which was fully functional. The original Mako Shark was then retroactively called the Mako Shark I. The Mako Shark II debuted in 1965 as a show car and this concept influenced Mitchell's redesigned Corvette of 1968.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nThe [[Chevrolet Aerovette|Aerovette]] has a [[mid-engine]] configuration using a [[Transverse engine|transverse]] mounting of its V-8 engine. [[Zora Arkus-Duntov]]'s engineers originally built two XP-882s during 1969. [[John DeLorean]], Chevy general manager, ordered one for display at the 1970 [[New York Auto Show]]. In 1972, DeLorean authorized further work on the XP-882. A near-identical body in [[aluminum alloy]] was constructed and became the XP-895 \"Reynolds Aluminum Car.\" Duntov and Mitchell responded with two [[Chevrolet Vega]] (stillborn) [[Wankel engine|Wankel]] 2-rotor engines joined together as a 4-rotor {{convert|420|hp|kW|abbr=on}} engine which was used to power the XP-895. It was first shown in late 1973. The 4-rotor show car was outfitted with a {{convert|400|cuin|L|abbr=on}} small-block V8 in 1977 and rechristened Aerovette. GM chairman [[Thomas Murphy (chairman)|Thomas Murphy]] approved the Aerovette for 1980 production, but Mitchell's retirement that year, combined with then Corvette chief engineer [[Dave McLellan]]'s lack of enthusiasm for the mid-engine design and slow-selling data on mid-engined cars killed the last hope for a mid-engine Corvette.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nA [[Corvette Stingray (concept car)#2009 Stingray Concept|Corvette Stingray Anniversary]] concept car was unveiled at the 2009 [[Detroit Auto Show]], fifty years after the Sting Ray racer-concept of 1959.<ref>{{cite book|title=Friends magazine-published by Chevrolet for Corvette owners|publisher=Chevrolet}}</ref> The vehicle was based on a combination of the 1963 Sting Ray and the 1968 Stingray.

Griphook agrees in exchange for the [[Sword of Gryffindor]]. Wandmaker [[Ollivander]] tells Harry that two wands taken from [[Malfoy Manor]] belonged to Bellatrix and [[Draco Malfoy]], though Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry.\n\nIn the vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux is [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of [[Lord Voldemort]] killing goblins including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at [[Hogwarts]] somehow connected to [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]. The trio [[apparate]] into [[Hogsmeade]], where [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] reluctantly instructs the [[Portrait (Harry Potter)|portrait]] of his deceased younger sister [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] to fetch [[Neville Longbottom]], who leads the trio through a secret passageway into Hogwarts.\n\n[[Severus Snape]] hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of punishment for aiding Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees after [[Minerva McGonagall]] challenges him to a duel. Voldemort then arrives with the Death Eaters, demanding Harry is given over to him; McGonagall gathers the Hogwarts community for battle. At [[Luna Lovegood]]'s insistence, Harry speaks to [[Helena Ravenclaw]]'s ghost, who reveals that Voldemort performed \"dark magic\" on her mother's diadem, located in the [[Room of Requirement]]. In the [[Chamber of Secrets]], Hermione destroys the Horcrux cup with a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|Basilisk]] fang. In the Room of Requirement, Draco, [[Blaise Zabini]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts a Fiendfyre curse; unable to control it, he is burned to death while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang, and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement to be destroyed. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] is the final Horcrux. After entering the boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; he then orders Nagini to kill Snape. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the [[Pensieve]]. Meanwhile, [[Fred Weasley]], [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] are killed in the chaos at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry learns from Snape's memories that while Snape despised Harry's late father [[James Potter (character)|James]], who bullied him, he loved his late mother [[Lily Potter|Lily]]. Following her death, Snape worked with [[Albus Dumbledore]] to protect Harry from Voldemort due to his love for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and wished for Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword was conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him; he must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within himself. Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Voldemort casts the [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] upon Harry, who finds himself in [[limbo]]. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's curse. Harry returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort.\n\nVoldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the sword from the [[Sorting Hat]], Harry reveals he is still alive; the Malfoys and many [[Death Eaters]] abandon Voldemort. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, [[Molly Weasley]] kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, making Voldemort mortal. Harry and Voldemort's fight ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand recognised him as its true master after he disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore. Harry destroys the Elder Wand rather than claim it.\n\nNineteen years later, Harry and [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron and Hermione, and Draco proudly watch their children leave for Hogwarts at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], one of Harry's best friends.\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]], Harry's other best friend, and the brain of the trio.\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], a [[Death Eater]] and [[Sirius Black]]'s cousin and murderer.\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]], Harry's half-giant friend and a former member of the staff of [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as [[Filius Flitwick]], the Charms master and Head of the [[Ravenclaw]] house at Hogwarts; and [[Griphook]], a [[Goblins (Harry Potter)|goblin]] and former employee at [[Gringotts]] Bank.\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Lord Voldemort]], a twisted, evil, power-hungry, powerful wizard, and the founder and supreme leader of the [[Death Eater]]s.\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Albus Dumbledore]], the late headmaster of [[Hogwarts]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Mr. Ollivander]], a wandmaker abducted by the Death Eaters.\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Lucius Malfoy]], Draco Malfoy's father and a disgraced [[Death Eater]].\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Sirius Black]], Harry's late godfather.\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Severus Snape]], former Head of the [[Slytherin]] House and Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher and the new headmaster of [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Minerva McGonagall]], the Transfiguration teacher and the Head of the [[Gryffindor]] house at [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Remus Lupin]], a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] and a former Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Julie Walters]] as [[Molly Weasley]], the Weasley matriarch\n<!---Credited as the main cast in film credits--->\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Casting===\nThe roles of several minor characters were recast or replaced for this film.

Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, \"our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That was part of the fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble.\" About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, \"We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. [[John Richardson (special effects designer)|John Richardson]], the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |title=Inside Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Production designer Stuart Craig gives AD an exclusive look at the sets of the upcoming film |first=Elizabeth |last=Stamp |work=Architectural Digest |accessdate=23 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120201728/http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |archivedate=20 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nCraig spoke about the Battle of Hogwarts to ''Art Insights Magazine'', saying that \"the great challenge is the destruction of Hogwarts.

A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really&nbsp;\u2013 maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely.\" When asked about the King's Cross scene near the end of the film, Craig said, \"We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white&nbsp;\u2013 so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |title=Stuart Craig Interview Transcript |work=Art Insights Magazine |accessdate=23 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913153753/http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |archive-date=13 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects supervisor Tim Burke said that \"It was such a major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, and we had to do it in different stages of production.

We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down.

Griphook agrees in exchange for the [[Sword of Gryffindor]]. Wandmaker [[Ollivander]] tells Harry that two wands taken from [[Malfoy Manor]] belonged to Bellatrix and [[Draco Malfoy]], though Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry.\n\nIn the vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux is [[Helga Hufflepuff]]'s cup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of [[Lord Voldemort]] killing goblins including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at [[Hogwarts]] somehow connected to [[Rowena Ravenclaw]]. The trio [[apparate]] into [[Hogsmeade]], where [[Aberforth Dumbledore]] reluctantly instructs the [[Portrait (Harry Potter)|portrait]] of his deceased younger sister [[Ariana Dumbledore|Ariana]] to fetch [[Neville Longbottom]], who leads the trio through a secret passageway into Hogwarts.\n\n[[Severus Snape]] hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of punishment for aiding Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees after [[Minerva McGonagall]] challenges him to a duel. Voldemort then arrives with the Death Eaters, demanding Harry is given over to him; McGonagall gathers the Hogwarts community for battle. At [[Luna Lovegood]]'s insistence, Harry speaks to [[Helena Ravenclaw]]'s ghost, who reveals that Voldemort performed \"dark magic\" on her mother's diadem, located in the [[Room of Requirement]]. In the [[Chamber of Secrets]], Hermione destroys the Horcrux cup with a [[Basilisk (Harry Potter)|Basilisk]] fang. In the Room of Requirement, Draco, [[Blaise Zabini]] and [[Gregory Goyle]] attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts a Fiendfyre curse; unable to control it, he is burned to death while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang, and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement to be destroyed. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake [[Nagini (Harry Potter)|Nagini]] is the final Horcrux. After entering the boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; he then orders Nagini to kill Snape. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the [[Pensieve]]. Meanwhile, [[Fred Weasley]], [[Remus Lupin]], and [[Nymphadora Tonks]] are killed in the chaos at Hogwarts.\n\nHarry learns from Snape's memories that while Snape despised Harry's late father [[James Potter (character)|James]], who bullied him, he loved his late mother [[Lily Potter|Lily]]. Following her death, Snape worked with [[Albus Dumbledore]] to protect Harry from Voldemort due to his love for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and wished for Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword was conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him; he must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within himself. Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the [[Hogwarts#Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]]. Voldemort casts the [[Avada Kedavra|Killing Curse]] upon Harry, who finds himself in [[limbo]]. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's curse. Harry returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort.\n\nVoldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the sword from the [[Sorting Hat]], Harry reveals he is still alive; the Malfoys and many [[Death Eaters]] abandon Voldemort. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, [[Molly Weasley]] kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, making Voldemort mortal. Harry and Voldemort's fight ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand recognised him as its true master after he disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore. Harry destroys the Elder Wand rather than claim it.\n\nNineteen years later, Harry and [[Ginny Weasley]], Ron and Hermione, and Draco proudly watch their children leave for Hogwarts at [[London King's Cross railway station|King's Cross station]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{further|List of Harry Potter cast members}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Daniel Radcliffe]] as [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]\n* [[Rupert Grint]] as [[Ron Weasley]], one of Harry's best friends.\n* [[Emma Watson]] as [[Hermione Granger]], Harry's other best friend, and the brain of the trio.\n* [[Helena Bonham Carter]] as [[Bellatrix Lestrange]], a [[Death Eater]] and [[Sirius Black]]'s cousin and murderer.\n* [[Robbie Coltrane]] as [[Rubeus Hagrid]], Harry's half-giant friend and a former member of the staff of [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Warwick Davis]] as [[Filius Flitwick]], the Charms master and Head of the [[Ravenclaw]] house at Hogwarts; and [[Griphook]], a [[Goblins (Harry Potter)|goblin]] and former employee at [[Gringotts]] Bank.\n* [[Ralph Fiennes]] as [[Lord Voldemort]], a twisted, evil, power-hungry, powerful wizard, and the founder and supreme leader of the [[Death Eater]]s.\n* [[Michael Gambon]] as [[Albus Dumbledore]], the late headmaster of [[Hogwarts]]\n* [[John Hurt]] as [[Mr. Ollivander]], a wandmaker abducted by the Death Eaters.\n* [[Jason Isaacs]] as [[Lucius Malfoy]], Draco Malfoy's father and a disgraced [[Death Eater]].\n* [[Gary Oldman]] as [[Sirius Black]], Harry's late godfather.\n* [[Alan Rickman]] as [[Severus Snape]], former Head of the [[Slytherin]] House and Potions and Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher and the new headmaster of [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Maggie Smith]] as [[Minerva McGonagall]], the Transfiguration teacher and the Head of the [[Gryffindor]] house at [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[David Thewlis]] as [[Remus Lupin]], a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]] and a former Defence Against the Dark Arts teacher at [[Hogwarts]].\n* [[Julie Walters]] as [[Molly Weasley]], the Weasley matriarch\n<!---Credited as the main cast in film credits--->\n{{div col end}}\n\n===Casting===\nThe roles of several minor characters were recast or replaced for this film.

Of the Gringotts Wizarding Bank, he said, \"our banking hall, like any other, is made of marble and big marble columns. And it has great strength. The fact that the goblins are the bankers and tellers at the counter helps that feeling of grandeur and solidity and the big proportions. That was part of the fun of the set: we exaggerated the size of it, we exaggerated the weight of it, and we even exaggerated the shine of the marble.\" About the multiplication of treasure in one of the bank's vaults, he noted, \"We made literally thousands of pieces for it and vacuum metallised them to be shiny gold and silver. [[John Richardson (special effects designer)|John Richardson]], the special effects supervisor, made a floor that was capable of rising on different levels, so there was kind of a physical swelling of the treasure on it.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |title=Inside Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, Production designer Stuart Craig gives AD an exclusive look at the sets of the upcoming film |first=Elizabeth |last=Stamp |work=Architectural Digest |accessdate=23 June 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120201728/http://www.architecturaldigest.com/resources/features/2011/07/harry-potter-set-design-slideshow |archivedate=20 January 2012}}</ref>\n\nCraig spoke about the Battle of Hogwarts to ''Art Insights Magazine'', saying that \"the great challenge is the destruction of Hogwarts. The sun rising behind the smoke ... the massive remains of destroyed walls, the entrance hall, the entrance of the Great Hall, part of the roof of the Great Hall completely gone, so yeah. A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really&nbsp;\u2013 maybe it helped me and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely.\" When asked about the King's Cross scene near the end of the film, Craig said, \"We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white&nbsp;\u2013 so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |title=Stuart Craig Interview Transcript |work=Art Insights Magazine |accessdate=23 June 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110913153753/http://www.artinsightsmagazine.com/ArtInsights_magazine/Stuart_Craig_Interview.html |archive-date=13 September 2011 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Visual effects===\nVisual effects supervisor Tim Burke said that \"It was such a major job to stage the Battle of Hogwarts, and we had to do it in different stages of production. We had shots with complex linking camera moves from wide overviews, to flying into windows and interior spaces. So, we took the plunge at the end of 2008, and started rebuilding the school digitally with Double Negative.\" He went on to say that \"It's taken two years&nbsp;\u2013 getting renders out, texturing every facet of the building, constructing interiors to see through windows, building a destruction version of the school. We can design shots with the knowledge that we have this brilliant digital miniature that we can do anything with. With a practical Hogwarts, we would have shot it last summer and been so tied down. Instead, as David Yates finds the flow and structure, we are able to handle new concepts and ideas.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/movies/785760/harry_potter_and_the_deathly_hallows_part_2_making_the_hogwarts_battle.html |title=Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 2: making the Hogwarts battle |publisher=Den of Greek |date=24 February 2011 |accessdate=20 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn the quality of 3D in film, Burke told ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', \"I think it's good, actually. I think people are going to be really pleased. I know everyone's a little nervous and sceptical of 3D these days, but the work has been done very, very well. We've done over 200 shots in 3D and in the visual effects as well, because so much of it is CG, so the results are very, very good. I think everyone's going to be really impressed with it, actually.\" Producer [[David Heyman]] spoke to ''SFX'' magazine about the [[2D to 3D conversion|3D conversion]], saying that \"The way David Yates is approaching 3D is he's trying to approach it from a character and story point of view. Trying to use the sense of isolation, of separation that sometimes 3D gives you, to heighten that at appropriate moments. So we're approaching it in a storytelling way.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |title=Deathly Hallows producer David Heyman explains why the 3D for the final Potter movie is more than just a gimmick |magazine=[[SFX (magazine)|SFX]] |edition=210 |date=26 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/2011/06/28/harry-potter-visual-effects-wizard-tim-burke-says-3D-is-very-very-good-in-final-film/ |title='Harry Potter': Visual effects wizard Tim Burke says 3D is 'very, very good' in final film |work=Los Angeles Times |date=28 June 2011 |accessdate=29 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 2012, the visual effects in the film were nominated for an Oscar.

The NCAA has officially recorded rebounding statistics since it first sponsored women's basketball. Whereas 3-point field goals were officially instituted by the NCAA for women's play in the 1987\u201388 season.\n\n[[Sabrina Ionescu]], whose career at [[Oregon Ducks women's basketball|Oregon]] was between 2016\u20132020, also holds an unique NCAA basketball record with 2,562 points, 1,040 rebounds and 1,091 assists; the only NCAA player, both men and women, to record a 2,000/1,000/1,000. [[Courtney Paris]], who recorded 2,729 points and 2,034 rebounds at [[Oklahoma Sooners women's basketball|Oklahoma]] between 2005\u20132009, is the only women with more than 2,000/2,000 and only player, both men and women, with more than 2,500/2,000. \n\n==Key==\n{{col-start}}{{col-break|width=50%}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n|'''Pos.'''||G||F||C||'''Ref.'''\n|-\n|[[Basketball position|Position]]||[[Basketball position#Back court|Guard]]||[[Basketball position#Frontcourt (forwards and center)|Forward]]||[[Center (basketball)|Center]]||References\n|-\n|}\n{{col-break}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#CFECEC; width:6em\"|^\n| Player still active in NCAA Division I\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#E0CEF2; width:6em\"|\u2020\n|Elected to the [[Women's Basketball Hall of Fame]]\n|-\n| style=\"background-color:#FFFF99; width:6em\"|*\n| Elected to the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]\n|-\n|}\n{{col-end}}\n\n==List==\n[[File:Sabrina Ionescu 2019 Pac 12 Tourney 2019-03-08 (cropped).jpg|thumb|200px|right|Ionescu at the 2019 Pac-12 Tournament]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"; style=\"text-align:center\";\n!

Since then, it had a short spell in the [[Belgian Second Division|Second Division]] between [[1993\u201394 in Belgian football|1993\u201394]] and [[1995\u201396 in Belgian football|1995\u201396]]. Lokeren had its most successful period in the 1980s, achieving second place in the league in [[1980\u201381 Belgian First Division|1980\u201381]] as well as a [[Belgian Cup]] final the same year. Its best European result was reaching the quarter-final of the [[1980\u201381 UEFA Cup]]. In the year 2000, the club merged with [[K. Sint-Niklase S.K.E.|K Sint-Niklase SKE]] They are registered to the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]] with the [[matricule|matricule number]] 282. Lokeren's colours are white, black and yellow. They play their home games at the [[Daknamstadion]].\n\nIn 2012, Sporting Lokeren won the Belgian Cup, the club's first-ever honours, after beating KV Kortrijk in the Cup Final. They won their 2nd Cup just two years later in 2014, after beating [[S.V. Zulte Waregem|Zulte Waregem]] 1\u20130.\n\n==History==\nThe matricule n\u00b0282 was given in [[1920 in football (soccer)|1920]] to a club named Football Club Racing Club Lokeren (nicknamed Racing FC), but the team stopped its activity the next year. In [[1923 in football (soccer)|22 January 1923]] Racing Club Lokeren was founded.  Between [[1945 in football (soccer)|1945]] and [[1951 in football (soccer)|1951]], it had a slight name change (to Racing Athletiek- en Football Club Lokeren) and the new name since 1951 was Koninklijke Racing Club Lokeren. Due to financial problems, the fusion with the other team from the town (Koninklijke Standaard FC Lokeren) became necessary in [[1970 in football (soccer)|1970]]. The new club was then named Koninklijke Sporting Club Lokeren.\n\nIn 2000, the club merged with Koninklijke Sint-Niklaas SKE to form Sporting Lokeren Sint-Niklaas Waasland. The latest name change occurred in [[2003 in football (soccer)|2003]], with the province name added to the club name.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn 2018 Sporting Lokeren were relegated to the Proximus League, Belgium's Second Tier of football.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2019/03/04/anderlecht-back-in-the-top-6-lokeren-relegated/|title=Anderlecht back in the Top 6, Lokeren relegated|date=4 March 2019|publisher=vrt.be}}</ref> In 2019, the club was taken over by a group led by Louis de Vries and Alexander Janssen, taking the positions of president and CEO respectively, however, on the 20th of April 2020 the club was declared bankrupt.<ref name=\"hln\"/>\n\n==Honours==\n*'''[[Belgian First Division]]:'''\n**'''Runners-up (1):''' 1980\u201381\n*'''[[Belgian Second Division]]:'''\n**'''Winners (1):''' 1995\u201396\n*'''[[Belgian Cup]]:'''\n**'''Winners (2):''' [[2011\u201312 Belgian Cup|2011\u201312]], [[2013\u201314 Belgian Cup|2013\u201314]]\n**'''Runners-up (1):''' 1980\u201381\n*'''[[Belgian Super Cup]]:'''\n**'''Runners-up (2):''' [[2012 Belgian Super Cup|2012]], [[2014 Belgian Super Cup|2014]]\n\n==European record==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Since then, it had a short spell in the [[Belgian Second Division|Second Division]] between [[1993\u201394 in Belgian football|1993\u201394]] and [[1995\u201396 in Belgian football|1995\u201396]]. Lokeren had its most successful period in the 1980s, achieving second place in the league in [[1980\u201381 Belgian First Division|1980\u201381]] as well as a [[Belgian Cup]] final the same year. Its best European result was reaching the quarter-final of the [[1980\u201381 UEFA Cup]]. In the year 2000, the club merged with [[K. Sint-Niklase S.K.E.|K Sint-Niklase SKE]] They are registered to the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]] with the [[matricule|matricule number]] 282. Lokeren's colors are white, black and yellow. They play their home games at the [[Daknamstadion]].\n\nIn 2012, Sporting Lokeren won the Belgian Cup, the club's first-ever honors, after beating KV Kortrijk in the Cup Final. They won their 2nd Cup just two years later in 2014, after beating [[S.V. Zulte Waregem|Zulte Waregem]] 1\u20130.\n\n==History==\nThe matricule n\u00b0282 was given in [[1920 in football (soccer)|1920]] to a club named Football Club Racing Club Lokeren (nicknamed Racing FC), but the team stopped its activity the next year. In [[1923 in football (soccer)|22 January 1923]] Racing Club Lokeren was founded.  Between [[1945 in football (soccer)|1945]] and [[1951 in football (soccer)|1951]], it had a slight name change (to Racing Athletiek- en Football Club Lokeren) and the new name since 1951 was Koninklijke Racing Club Lokeren. Due to financial problems, the fusion with the other team from the town (Koninklijke Standaard FC Lokeren) became necessary in [[1970 in football (soccer)|1970]]. The new club was then named Koninklijke Sporting Club Lokeren.\n\nIn 2000, the club merged with Koninklijke Sint-Niklaas SKE to form Sporting Lokeren Sint-Niklaas Waasland. The latest name change occurred in [[2003 in football (soccer)|2003]], with the province name added to the club name.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn 2018 Sporting Lokeren were relegated to the Proximus League, Belgium's Second Tier of football.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.vrt.be/vrtnws/en/2019/03/04/anderlecht-back-in-the-top-6-lokeren-relegated/|title=Anderlecht back in the Top 6, Lokeren relegated|date=4 March 2019|publisher=vrt.be}}</ref> In 2019, the club was taken over by a group led by Louis de Vries and Alexander Janssen, taking the positions of president and CEO respectively, however, on the 20th of April 2020 the club was declared bankrupt.<ref name=\"hln\"/>\n\n==Honours==\n*'''[[Belgian First Division]]:'''\n**'''Runners-up (1):''' 1980\u201381\n*'''[[Belgian Second Division]]:'''\n**'''Winners (1):''' 1995\u201396\n*'''[[Belgian Cup]]:'''\n**'''Winners (2):''' [[2011\u201312 Belgian Cup|2011\u201312]], [[2013\u201314 Belgian Cup|2013\u201314]]\n**'''Runners-up (1):''' 1980\u201381\n*'''[[Belgian Super Cup]]:'''\n**'''Runners-up (2):''' [[2012 Belgian Super Cup|2012]], [[2014 Belgian Super Cup|2014]]\n\n==European record==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Detective Bruce Kenner ([[Ethan Hawke]]) investigates the case of John Gray ([[David Dencik]]), who admits to sexually abusing his 17-year-old daughter Angela ([[Emma Watson]]) but has no recollection of the abuse. They seek the help of Professor Kenneth Raines ([[David Thewlis]]) to use [[recovered-memory therapy]] on John Gray to retrieve his memories, and come to suspect that their colleague Detective George Nesbitt ([[Aaron Ashmore]]) is involved. They detain him but fail to find evidence against him. Detectives suspect a [[Satanism|satanic cult]] is involved because of Angela's testimony, in which Angela says that she was abused by people in masks and someone took pictures of it.\n\nBruce and Kenneth meet Angela's estranged brother Roy Gray ([[Devon Bostick]]) to inquire about why he left the house. Using the regression technique on him, he recalls hooded figures entering his room while he was young. Bruce and Kenneth suspect Roy's grandmother, Rose Gray ([[Dale Dickey]]), has some involvement but find nothing after a search of her house.\n\nMeanwhile, Bruce begins having nightmares involving satanic rituals. Angela tells him that the cult is out to kill her as she has shown her demonic mark to him and that he is in danger as well. She tells him that her mother received miscellaneous calls and saw strange figures staring at her in the street before she met with an accident. Bruce starts to experience the same things and his nightmares increase in intensity.\n\nRose jumps from the window of her house after seeing ghostly figures, injuring herself. Bruce meets Angela in the church's cemetery to reassure her and after an emotional outburst, she kisses him. Shocked, Bruce leaves her there and returns to his home. He sees a soup advertisement on the street and recognizes the woman in it as the one he sees in his nightmares. He concludes that his imagination has run away with him. He tells Kenneth that all these past memories are induced by therapy and the whole situation is just the result of mass hysteria. Though the professor is initially resistant to the idea, he too comes to suspect that these memories were not real.\n\nBruce is attacked by two hooded figures who finally reveal themselves as George and their colleague, Farrell ([[Aaron Abrams]]). George was seeking revenge after Bruce detained him as a child molester and ruined his career. Bruce offers to forget the whole situation if George tells him everything he knows. After George reveals things, Bruce confronts Angela about her abuse and she insists she told the truth. Finally Bruce concludes that she was fabricating everything from the beginning as she wanted to escape from her family, whom she thinks are responsible for her mother's death. She wanted to elope with George, as they had a sexual relationship for some time, but he refused to elope with a minor. Angela accused her father in order to escape the house. When Bruce confronts her, she tells him that no one is going to believe him, especially if she tells them that they kissed in the cemetery. Bruce tells John everything but John decides to take the blame and pleads guilty in order to rescue Angela and hopes that she will forgive him one day for being a bad father.\n\nThe film ends with a statement that many cases like this were reported before the [[satanic abuse hysteria]] faded.\n\nEmma Watson as Angela gray. Also the sexiest women ever! Wish I cpuld be the one kissing her\n\n==Production==\nOn October 31, 2013, it was announced that [[Ethan Hawke]] would star in the thriller film ''Regression''.

Detective Bruce Kenner ([[Ethan Hawke]]) investigates the case of John Gray ([[David Dencik]]), who admits to sexually abusing his 17-year-old daughter Angela ([[Emma Watson]]) but has no recollection of the abuse. They seek the help of Professor Kenneth Raines ([[David Thewlis]]) to use [[recovered-memory therapy]] on John Gray to retrieve his memories, and come to suspect that their colleague Detective George Nesbitt ([[Aaron Ashmore]]) is involved. They detain him but fail to find evidence against him. Detectives suspect a [[Satanism|satanic cult]] is involved because of Angela's testimony, in which Angela says that she was abused by people in masks and someone took pictures of it.\n\nBruce and Kenneth meet Angela's estranged brother Roy Gray ([[Devon Bostick]]) to inquire about why he left the house. Using the regression technique on him, he recalls hooded figures entering his room while he was young. Bruce and Kenneth suspect Roy's grandmother, Rose Gray ([[Dale Dickey]]), has some involvement but find nothing after a search of her house.\n\nMeanwhile, Bruce begins having nightmares involving satanic rituals. Angela tells him that the cult is out to kill her as she has shown her demonic mark to him and that he is in danger as well. She tells him that her mother received miscellaneous calls and saw strange figures staring at her in the street before she met with an accident. Bruce starts to experience the same things and his nightmares increase in intensity.\n\nRose jumps from the window of her house after seeing ghostly figures, injuring herself. Bruce meets Angela in the church's cemetery to reassure her and after an emotional outburst, she kisses him. Shocked, Bruce leaves her there and returns to his home. He sees a soup advertisement on the street and recognizes the woman in it as the one he sees in his nightmares. He concludes that his imagination has run away with him. He tells Kenneth that all these past memories are induced by therapy and the whole situation is just the result of mass hysteria. Though the professor is initially resistant to the idea, he too comes to suspect that these memories were not real.\n\nBruce is attacked by two hooded figures who finally reveal themselves as George and their colleague, Farrell ([[Aaron Abrams]]). George was seeking revenge after Bruce detained him as a child molester and ruined his career. Bruce offers to forget the whole situation if George tells him everything he knows. After George reveals things, Bruce confronts Angela about her abuse and she insists she told the truth. Finally Bruce concludes that she was fabricating everything from the beginning as she wanted to escape from her family, whom she thinks are responsible for her mother's death. She wanted to elope with George, as they had a sexual relationship for some time, but he refused to elope with a minor. Angela accused her father in order to escape the house. When Bruce confronts her, she tells him that no one is going to believe him, especially if she tells them that they kissed in the cemetery. Bruce tells John everything but John decides to take the blame and pleads guilty in order to rescue Angela and hopes that she will forgive him one day for being a bad father.\n\nThe film ends with a statement that many cases like this were reported before the [[satanic abuse hysteria]] faded.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Ethan Hawke]]<ref name=\"Ethan\" /> as Detective Bruce Kenner\n* [[Emma Watson]]<ref name=\"Emma\" /> as Angela Gray\n* [[David Thewlis]] as Professor Kenneth Raines\n* [[Lothaire Bluteau]] as Reverend Murray\n* [[Dale Dickey]] as Rose Gray, Angela's grandmother.\n* [[David Dencik]]<ref name=\"David\" /> as John Gray, Angela's father.\n* [[Peter MacNeill]] as Police Chief Cleveland\n* [[Devon Bostick]]<ref name=\"Devon\" /> as Roy Gray, Angela's brother.\n* [[Aaron Ashmore]] as Detective George Nesbitt\n* [[Adam Butcher]] as Brody\n* [[Kristian Bruun]] as Andrew\n* [[Aaron Abrams]] as Farrell\n* [[Julian Richings]] as Tom\n* [[Wendy Lyon]] as Norma\n* [[Janet Porter]] as S.

{"title_page": "Quantum Hall effect", "text_new": "{{short description|quantum-mechanical version of the Hall effect}}\nThe '''quantum Hall effect''' (or '''integer quantum Hall effect''') is a [[quantum mechanics|quantum-mechanical]] version of the [[Hall effect]], observed in [[2DEG|two-dimensional electron systems]] subjected to low [[temperature]]s and strong [[magnetic field]]s, in which the Hall [[Electrical resistance and conductance|conductance]] {{math|''\u03c3''}} undergoes [[quantum Hall transitions]] to take on the quantized values\n\n:<math> \\sigma = \\frac{I_\\text{channel}}{V_\\text{Hall}} = \\nu \\frac{e^2}{h}, </math>\n\nwhere {{math|''I''<sub>channel</sub>}} is the channel [[electric current|current]], {{math|''V''<sub>Hall</sub>}} is the [[Hall effect|Hall voltage]], {{math|''e''}} is the [[elementary charge]] and {{math|''h''}} is [[Planck's constant]]. The prefactor {{math|[[Nu (letter)|''\u03bd'']]}} is known as the filling factor, and can take on either integer ({{math|''\u03bd'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3,...}}) or fractional ({{math|''\u03bd'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|2|5}}, {{sfrac|3|7}}, {{sfrac|2|3}}, {{sfrac|3|5}}, {{sfrac|1|5}}, {{sfrac|2|9}}, {{sfrac|3|13}}, {{sfrac|5|2}}, {{sfrac|12|5}},...}}) values. The quantum Hall effect is referred to as the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect depending on whether {{math|''\u03bd''}} is an integer or fraction, respectively.\n\nThe striking feature of the integer quantum Hall effect is the persistence of the quantization (i.e. the Hall plateau) as the electron density is varied. Since the electron density remains constant when the Fermi level is in a clean spectral gap, this situation corresponds to one where the Fermi level is an energy with a finite density of states, though these states are localized (see [[Anderson localization]]).\n\nThe [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] is more complicated, as its existence relies fundamentally on electron\u2013electron interactions. The fractional quantum Hall effect is also understood as an integer quantum Hall effect, although not of electrons but of charge-flux composites known as [[composite fermions]]. In 1988, it was proposed that there was quantum Hall effect without [[Landau quantization|Landau levels]].<ref name=Haldane:1988 /> This quantum Hall effect is referred to as the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect. There is also a new concept of the [[quantum spin Hall effect]] which is an analogue of the quantum Hall effect, where spin currents flow instead of charge currents.<ref>{{cite book | first=Zyun F. | last=Ezawa | title=Quantum Hall Effects: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Developments | edition=3rd | publisher=World Scientific | year=2013 | isbn=978-981-4360-75-3}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe quantization of the Hall conductance has the important property of being exceedingly precise. Actual measurements of the Hall conductance have been found to be integer or fractional multiples of {{math|{{sfrac|''e''<sup>2</sup>|''h''}}}} to nearly one part in a billion. This phenomenon, referred to as ''exact quantization'', has been shown to be a subtle manifestation of the principle of [[gauge invariance]].<ref name=Laughlin:1981 /> It has allowed for the definition of a new practical [[physical unit|standard]] for [[electrical resistance]], based on the resistance quantum given by the von Klitzing constant {{math|''R''<sub>K</sub>}}.

The Landau Levels spread out with increasing field. Between the levels the quantum hall effect is seen.]]\nIn two dimensions, when classical electrons are subjected to a magnetic field they follow circular cyclotron orbits. When the system is treated quantum mechanically, these orbits are quantized. The energy levels of these quantized orbitals take on discrete values:\n:<math>E_n = \\hbar \\omega_\\text{c} \\left(n+\\tfrac12\\right),</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03c9''<sub>c</sub> {{=}} {{sfrac|''eB''|''m''}}}} is the cyclotron frequency.

For strong magnetic fields, each Landau level is highly degenerate (i.e. there are many single particle states which have the same energy {{math|''E<sub>n</sub>''}}). Specifically, for a sample of area {{math|''A''}}, in magnetic field {{math|''B''}}, the degeneracy of each Landau level is\n:<math>N = g_\\text{s} \\frac{BA}{\\phi_0},</math>\n\nwhere {{math|''g''<sub>s</sub>}} represents a factor of 2 for spin degeneracy, and {{math|''\u03d5''<sub>0</sub> \u2248 {{val|2|e=-15|ul=Wb}}}} is the [[magnetic flux quantum]]. For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, each Landau level may have so many states that all of the free electrons in the system sit in only a few Landau levels; it is in this regime where one observes the quantum Hall effect.\n\n== Photonic Quantum Hall ==\n[[File:Hofstadter's_butterfly.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hofstadter's_butterfly.png|thumb|[[Hofstadter's butterfly]]]]\nThe Quantum Hall effect, in addition to being observed in [[2DEG|two-dimensional electron systems]], can be observed in photons. [[Photon]]s do not posses inherent [[electric charge]], but through the manipulation of discrete optical resonators and [[Quantum phases|quantum mechanical phase]], therein creates an artificial [[magnetic field]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schine|first=Nathan|last2=Ryou|first2=Albert|last3=Gromov|first3=Andrey|last4=Sommer|first4=Ariel|last5=Simon|first5=Jonathan|date=June 2016|title=Synthetic Landau levels for photons|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature17943|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=534|issue=7609|pages=671\u2013675|doi=10.1038/nature17943|issn=0028-0836}}</ref> This process can be expressed through a metaphor of photons bouncing between multiple mirrors. By shooting the light across multiple mirrors, the photons are routed and gain additional phase proportional to their [[Angular momentum operator|angular momentum]]. This creates an effect like they are in a [[magnetic field]].\n\n==Mathematics==\n[[Image:Hofstadter's butterfly.png|thumb|[[Hofstadter's butterfly]]]]\nThe integers that appear in the Hall effect are examples of [[topological quantum number]]s. They are known in mathematics as the first [[Chern class#Chern numbers|Chern numbers]] and are closely related to [[Geometric phase|Berry's phase]]. A striking model of much interest in this context is the Azbel\u2013Harper\u2013Hofstadter model whose quantum phase diagram is the [[Hofstadter butterfly]] shown in the figure. The vertical axis is the strength of the [[magnetic field]] and the horizontal axis is the [[chemical potential]], which fixes the electron density. The colors represent the integer Hall conductances. Warm colors represent positive integers and cold colors negative integers. Note, however, that the density of states in these regions of quantized Hall conductance is zero; hence, they cannot produce the plateaus observed in the experiments. The phase diagram is fractal and has structure on all scales. In the figure there is an obvious [[self-similarity]]. In the presence of disorder, which is the source of the plateaus seen in the experiments, this diagram is very different and the fractal structure is mostly washed away.\n\nConcerning physical mechanisms, impurities and/or particular states (e.g., edge currents) are important for both the 'integer' and 'fractional' effects. In addition, Coulomb interaction is also essential in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. The observed strong similarity between integer and fractional quantum Hall effects is explained by the tendency of electrons to form bound states with an even number of magnetic flux quanta, called ''[[composite fermions]]''.\n\n==The Bohr atom interpretation of the von Klitzing constant==\n\nThe value of the von Klitzing constant may be obtained already on the level of a single atom within the [[Bohr model]] while looking at it as a single-electron Hall effect. While during the [[cyclotron|cyclotron motion]] on a circular orbit the centrifugal force is balanced by the [[Lorentz force]] responsible for the transverse induced voltage and the Hall effect one may look at the Coulomb potential difference in the Bohr atom as the induced single atom Hall voltage and the periodic electron motion on a circle a Hall current. Defining the single atom Hall current as a rate a single electron charge <math>e</math> is making Kepler revolutions with angular frequency <math>\\omega</math>\n\n:<math>I = \\frac{\\omega e}{2\\pi},</math>\n\nand the induced Hall voltage as a difference between the hydrogen nucleus Coulomb potential at the electron orbital point and at infinity:\n\n:<math>U=V_\\text{C}(\\infty) - V_\\text{C}(r) = 0 - V_\\text{C}(r) = \\frac{e}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}</math>\n\nOne obtains the quantization of the defined Bohr orbit Hall resistance in steps of the von Klitzing constant as\n\n:<math>R_\\text{Bohr}(n) = \\frac{U}{I} = n\\frac{h}{e^2}</math>\n\nwhich for the Bohr atom is linear but not inverse in the integer ''n''.\n\n==Relativistic analogs==\n\nRelativistic examples of the integer quantum Hall effect and [[quantum spin Hall effect]] arise in the context of [[lattice gauge theory]].<ref name=Kaplan:1992 /><ref name=Golterman:1993 />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Quantum Hall transitions]]\n*[[Fractional quantum Hall effect]]\n*[[Quantum anomalous Hall effect]]\n*[[Quantum cellular automata]]\n*[[Composite fermions]]\n*[[Conductance quantum|Conductance Quantum]]\n*[[Hall effect]]\n*[[Hall probe]]\n*[[Graphene]]\n*[[Quantum spin Hall effect]]\n*[[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange#Coulomb potential between two current loops embedded in a magnetic field|Coulomb potential between two current loops embedded in a magnetic field]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Laughlin:1981>\n{{cite journal\n |author=R.

The prefactor {{math|[[Nu (letter)|''\u03bd'']]}} is known as the filling factor, and can take on either integer ({{math|''\u03bd'' {{=}} 1, 2, 3,...}}) or fractional ({{math|''\u03bd'' {{=}} {{sfrac|1|3}}, {{sfrac|2|5}}, {{sfrac|3|7}}, {{sfrac|2|3}}, {{sfrac|3|5}}, {{sfrac|1|5}}, {{sfrac|2|9}}, {{sfrac|3|13}}, {{sfrac|5|2}}, {{sfrac|12|5}},...}}) values. The quantum Hall effect is referred to as the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect depending on whether {{math|''\u03bd''}} is an integer or fraction, respectively.\n\nThe striking feature of the integer quantum Hall effect is the persistence of the quantization (i.e. the Hall plateau) as the electron density is varied. Since the electron density remains constant when the Fermi level is in a clean spectral gap, this situation corresponds to one where the Fermi level is an energy with a finite density of states, though these states are localized (see [[Anderson localization]]).\n\nThe [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] is more complicated, as its existence relies fundamentally on electron\u2013electron interactions. The fractional quantum Hall effect is also understood as an integer quantum Hall effect, although not of electrons but of charge-flux composites known as [[composite fermions]]. In 1988, it was proposed that there was quantum Hall effect without [[Landau quantization|Landau levels]].<ref name=Haldane:1988 /> This quantum Hall effect is referred to as the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect. There is also a new concept of the [[quantum spin Hall effect]] which is an analogue of the quantum Hall effect, where spin currents flow instead of charge currents.<ref>{{cite book | first=Zyun F. | last=Ezawa | title=Quantum Hall Effects: Recent Theoretical and Experimental Developments | edition=3rd | publisher=World Scientific | year=2013 | isbn=978-981-4360-75-3}}</ref>\n\n==Applications==\nThe quantization of the Hall conductance has the important property of being exceedingly precise. Actual measurements of the Hall conductance have been found to be integer or fractional multiples of {{math|{{sfrac|''e''<sup>2</sup>|''h''}}}} to nearly one part in a billion. This phenomenon, referred to as ''exact quantization'', has been shown to be a subtle manifestation of the principle of [[gauge invariance]].<ref name=Laughlin:1981 /> It has allowed for the definition of a new practical [[physical unit|standard]] for [[electrical resistance]], based on the resistance quantum given by the von Klitzing constant {{math|''R''<sub>K</sub>}}.

For sufficiently strong magnetic fields, each Landau level may have so many states that all of the free electrons in the system sit in only a few Landau levels; it is in this regime where one observes the quantum Hall effect.\n\n== Photonic Quantum Hall ==\n[[File:Hofstadter's_butterfly.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hofstadter's_butterfly.png|thumb|[[Hofstadter's butterfly]]]]\nThe Quantum Hall effect, in addition to being observed in [[2DEG|two-dimensional electron systems]], can be observed in photons. [[Photon]]s do not posses inherent [[electric charge]], but through the manipulation of discrete optical resonators and [[Quantum phases|quantum mechanical phase]], therein creates an artificial [[magnetic field]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schine|first=Nathan|last2=Ryou|first2=Albert|last3=Gromov|first3=Andrey|last4=Sommer|first4=Ariel|last5=Simon|first5=Jonathan|date=June 2016|title=Synthetic Landau levels for photons|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature17943|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=534|issue=7609|pages=671\u2013675|doi=10.1038/nature17943|issn=0028-0836}}</ref> This process can be expressed through a metaphor of photons bouncing between multiple mirrors. By shooting the light across multiple mirrors, the photons are routed and gain additional phase proportional to their [[Angular momentum operator|angular momentum]]. This creates an effect like they are in a [[magnetic field]].\n\n==Mathematics==\n[[Image:Hofstadter's butterfly.png|thumb|[[Hofstadter's butterfly]]]]\nThe integers that appear in the Hall effect are examples of [[topological quantum number]]s. They are known in mathematics as the first [[Chern class#Chern numbers|Chern numbers]] and are closely related to [[Geometric phase|Berry's phase]]. A striking model of much interest in this context is the Azbel\u2013Harper\u2013Hofstadter model whose quantum phase diagram is the [[Hofstadter butterfly]] shown in the figure. The vertical axis is the strength of the [[magnetic field]] and the horizontal axis is the [[chemical potential]], which fixes the electron density. The colors represent the integer Hall conductances. Warm colors represent positive integers and cold colors negative integers. Note, however, that the density of states in these regions of quantized Hall conductance is zero; hence, they cannot produce the plateaus observed in the experiments. The phase diagram is fractal and has structure on all scales. In the figure there is an obvious [[self-similarity]]. In the presence of disorder, which is the source of the plateaus seen in the experiments, this diagram is very different and the fractal structure is mostly washed away.\n\nConcerning physical mechanisms, impurities and/or particular states (e.g., edge currents) are important for both the 'integer' and 'fractional' effects. In addition, Coulomb interaction is also essential in the [[fractional quantum Hall effect]]. The observed strong similarity between integer and fractional quantum Hall effects is explained by the tendency of electrons to form bound states with an even number of magnetic flux quanta, called ''[[composite fermions]]''.\n\n==The Bohr atom interpretation of the von Klitzing constant==\n\nThe value of the von Klitzing constant may be obtained already on the level of a single atom within the [[Bohr model]] while looking at it as a single-electron Hall effect. While during the [[cyclotron|cyclotron motion]] on a circular orbit the centrifugal force is balanced by the [[Lorentz force]] responsible for the transverse induced voltage and the Hall effect one may look at the Coulomb potential difference in the Bohr atom as the induced single atom Hall voltage and the periodic electron motion on a circle a Hall current. Defining the single atom Hall current as a rate a single electron charge <math>e</math> is making Kepler revolutions with angular frequency <math>\\omega</math>\n\n:<math>I = \\frac{\\omega e}{2\\pi},</math>\n\nand the induced Hall voltage as a difference between the hydrogen nucleus Coulomb potential at the electron orbital point and at infinity:\n\n:<math>U=V_\\text{C}(\\infty) - V_\\text{C}(r) = 0 - V_\\text{C}(r) = \\frac{e}{4\\pi\\epsilon_0 r}</math>\n\nOne obtains the quantization of the defined Bohr orbit Hall resistance in steps of the von Klitzing constant as\n\n:<math>R_\\text{Bohr}(n) = \\frac{U}{I} = n\\frac{h}{e^2}</math>\n\nwhich for the Bohr atom is linear but not inverse in the integer ''n''.\n\n==Relativistic analogs==\n\nRelativistic examples of the integer quantum Hall effect and [[quantum spin Hall effect]] arise in the context of [[lattice gauge theory]].<ref name=Kaplan:1992 /><ref name=Golterman:1993 />\n\n==See also==\n*[[Quantum Hall transitions]]\n*[[Fractional quantum Hall effect]]\n*[[Quantum anomalous Hall effect]]\n*[[Quantum cellular automata]]\n*[[Composite fermions]]\n*[[Hall effect]]\n*[[Hall probe]]\n*[[Graphene]]\n*[[Quantum spin Hall effect]]\n*[[Static forces and virtual-particle exchange#Coulomb potential between two current loops embedded in a magnetic field|Coulomb potential between two current loops embedded in a magnetic field]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=Laughlin:1981>\n{{cite journal\n |author=R.
