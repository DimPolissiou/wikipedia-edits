She was built by [[Sheerness Dockyard]] from 1891\u20131893. She was converted to a minesweeper in 1908\u20131909 and continued these duties during the [[First World War]]. ''Leda'' was scrapped in 1922.\n\n==Design and construction==\n''Leda'' was one of 11 ''Alarm''-class torpedo gunboats ordered for the Royal Navy under the 1889 Naval Defence Act, which authorised the shipbuilding programme for the next five years, and also included the last two torpedo-gunboats of the {{sclass-|Sharpshooter|torpedo gunboat|0}} and the five torpedo-gunboats of the {{Sclass-|Dryad|torpedo gunboat|0}}. The ''Alarm''s were slightly modified  versions of the previous ''Sharpshooter''-class, with modified engines to improve reliability.<ref name=\"fried p33\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2009|p=33}}</ref>\n\n''Leda'' was {{convert|230|ft|m|2}} long [[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|27|ft|m|2}} and a [[Draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|m|2}}. [[Displacement (ship)|Displacement]] was {{convert|810|LT|t}}. Two triple-expansion steam engines, fed by four locomotive boilers, drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was heavier than that installed in the ''Sharpshooter''s, and was slightly downrated (from {{convert|3600|ihp|kW}} to {{convert|3500|ihp|kW}}) to improve reliability. This gave a speed of {{convert|18.7|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref name=\"conways60 p89\">{{Harvnb|Chesneau|Kolesnik|1979|p=89}}</ref><ref name=\"fried p33,288\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2009|pp=33, 288}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Moore|1990|p=67}}</ref>\n\nThe ship was armed with two 4.7 inch (120&nbsp;mm) QF guns mounted fore and aft on the ships centreline, backed up by four 3-pounder (47&nbsp;mm) guns (two in single mounts on the ship's beam and two in casemates forward) and a single [[Gardner gun|Gardner machine gun]]. Five 14-inch torpedo tubes were fitted (one fixed in the ship's bow and two twin mounts), with three reload torpedoes carried.<ref name=\"conways60 p89\"/><ref name=\"fried p27,32\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2009|pp=27, 32}}</ref> The ship had a crew of 91.<ref name=\"conways60 p89\"/>\n\n''Leda'' was [[Keel laying|laid down]] at [[Sheerness Dockyard]] on 25 June 1891 and [[ceremonial ship launching|launched]] on 13 September 1892.

She was built by [[Sheerness Dockyard]] from 1891\u20131893. She was converted to a minesweeper in 1908\u20131909 and continued these duties during the [[First World War]]. ''Leda'' was scrapped in 1922.\n\n==Design and construction==\n''Leda'' was one of 11 ''Alarm''-class torpedo gunboats ordered for the Royal Navy under the 1889 Naval Defence Act, which authorised the shipbuilding programme for the next five years, and also included the last two torpedo-gunboats of the {{sclass-|Sharpshooter|torpedo gunboat|0}} and the five torpedo-gunboats of the {{Sclass-|Dryad|torpedo gunboat|0}}. The ''Alarm''s were slightly modified  versions of the previous ''Sharpshooter''-class, with modified engines to improve reliability.<ref name=\"fried p33\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2009|p=33}}</ref>\n\n''Leda'' was {{convert|230|ft|m|2}} long [[length between perpendiculars|between perpendiculars]], with a [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|27|ft|m|2}} and a [[Draft (ship)|draught]] of {{convert|12|ft|m|2}}. [[Displacement (ship)|Displacement]] was {{convert|810|LT|t}}. Two triple-expansion steam engines, fed by four locomotive boilers, drove two propeller shafts. The machinery was heavier than that installed in the ''Sharpshooter''s, and was slightly downrated (from {{convert|3600|ihp|kW}} to {{convert|3500|ihp|kW}}) to improve reliability. This gave a speed of {{convert|18.7|kn|mph km/h}}.<ref name=\"conways60 p89\">{{Harvnb|Chesneau|Kolesnik|1979|p=89}}</ref><ref name=\"fried p33,288\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2009|pp=33, 288}}</ref><ref>{{Harvnb|Moore|1990|p=67}}</ref>\n\nThe ship was armed with two 4.7 inch (120&nbsp;mm) QF guns mounted fore and aft on the ships centreline, backed up by four 3-pounder (47&nbsp;mm) guns (two in single mounts on the ship's beam and two in casemates forward) and a single [[Gardner gun|Gardner machine gun]].

It organised [[free party|free parties]] and became involved in housing, social exclusion, and community projects, founded upon the principle of [[DIY culture]]. The group [[squatted]] buildings and repeatedly came into conflict with [[Bedfordshire Police]], which resulted in a 1995 public inquiry by [[Bedfordshire County Council]] into alleged police harrassment. The license of a pub owned by the mother of people in the collective was revoked, a decision which was later overturned by a [[Judicial review|judicial review]]\n\nThe collective occupied a disused farm and turned it into a community project which they later bought. The fortnightly [[raves]] in venues across [[Bedfordshire]] attracted up to 10,000 people and, especially during the Marsh Farm riots of 1995, served to defuse tensions locally. By 2000, the collective was holding licensed raves in agreement with landowners. The collective disbanded in 2000, later reforming as a [[Dub music|dub]] sound system under the name '''Leviticus'''. Some members were then involved in the Marsh Farm Outreach community group, which successfully campaigned to build a local community centre.\n\n==Formation==\nExodus as a [[Sound system (DJ)|sound system]] was formed on 5 June 1992, when the collective hosted a [[free party]] near woods in [[Dunstable]], [[Bedfordshire]], promoting it through [[word of mouth]] in local pubs. A few days earlier, founding member DJ Hazad had reclaimed some speaker cabinets which had been left in a rubbish bin, enlisting a friend to fit speakers in them. The collective was inspired by Luton [[Dub music|dub]] sound system Gemini High Power.<ref name=\"mckay\">{{cite book |last1=Malyon |first1=Tim |editor1-last=McKay |editor1-first=George |title=DiY Culture: Party & Protest in Nineties Britain |date=1998 |publisher=[[Verso Books|Verso]] |location=London |isbn=9781859842607 |pages=187\u2013207 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=KaP-bAMAYlYC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA187#v=onepage&q&f=false |language=en |chapter=Tossed in the fire and they never got burnt: The Exodus Collective}}</ref>{{rp|188\u2013189}}\n\nExodus raised funds through donations and bar takings, reinvesting the money in equipment.

The group [[squatted]] buildings and repeatedly came into conflict with [[Bedfordshire Police]], which resulted in a 1995 public inquiry by [[Bedfordshire County Council]] into alleged police harrassment. The license of a pub owned by the mother of people in the collective was revoked, a decision which was later overturned by a [[Judicial review|judicial review]]\n\nThe collective occupied a disused farm and turned it into a community project which they later bought. The fortnightly [[raves]] in venues across [[Bedfordshire]] attracted up to 10,000 people and, especially during the Marsh Farm riots of 1995, served to defuse tensions locally. By 2000, the collective was holding licensed raves in agreement with landowners. The collective disbanded in 2000, later reforming as a [[Dub music|dub]] sound system under the name '''Leviticus'''. Some members were then involved in the Marsh Farm Outreach community group, which successfully campaigned to build a local community centre.\n\n==Formation==\nExodus as a [[Sound system (DJ)|sound system]] was formed on 5 June 1992, when the collective hosted a [[free party]] near woods in [[Dunstable]], [[Bedfordshire]], promoting it through [[word of mouth]] in local pubs.

{"title_page": "Vernal pool", "text_new": "{{short description|Seasonal pools of water that provide habitat for distinctive plants and animals}}\n[[Image:Vernal Pools 2.jpg|right|thumb|Vernal pool with clay hardpan bottom, Vina Plains Nature Conservancy Preserve, Calif.]]\n'''Vernal pools''', also called '''vernal ponds''' or '''ephemeral pools''', are seasonal pools of water that provide habitat for distinctive plants and animals. They are considered to be a distinctive type of [[wetland]] usually devoid of fish, and thus allow the safe development of natal amphibian and insect species unable to withstand competition or predation by fish. Certain [[tropical]] fish lineages (such as [[killifish]]es) have however [[adaptation|adapted]] to this [[habitat]] specifically.\n\nVernal pools are a type of [[wetland]]. They can be surrounded by many communities/species including deciduous forest, grassland, lodgepole pine forest, blue oak woodland, sagebrush steppe, succulent coastal scrub and prairie. These pools are characteristic of Mediterranean climates, but occur in many other ecosystems.\n\n==Generation and annual development==\n[[File:Enchanted Rock Vernal Pool.png|thumb|right|An inundated rock vernal pool on [[Enchanted Rock]]. Note the one inhabited by cacti in the background.]]\nDuring most years, a vernal pool basin will experience [[inundation]] from rain/precipitation, followed by [[desiccation]] from [[evapotranspiration]]. These conditions are commonly associated with [[Mediterranean climate]]. Most pools are dry for at least part of the year, and fill with the winter rains, spring snowmelts and rising water tables. Some pools may remain at least partially filled with water over the course of a year or more, but all vernal pools dry up periodically. Typically, though, a vernal pool has three phases each year: it is inundated in the Winter (Inundated Phase), it dries slowly in the Spring (Flowering Phase), and in the summer it completely dries (Dry phase). A key time during vernal pool development between the flooding and evaporation phases is the flowering of native species, which attracts pollinators and influences seed distribution patterns. Vernal pools favor native species because non-natives can't handle the conditions of the water staying on the landscape for as long as it does, but not long enough to support truly aquatic species.\n\nA key formation of the vernal pools is due to the claypan, aka hardpan, aquitard, or otherwise impermeable layer. Clay soils bind closely together and become impermeable to water. When it rains the water percolates until it reaches the claypan and sits there, filling up with material and water.\n\nSome authorities restrict the definition of vernal pools to exclude seasonal wetlands that have defined inlet and outlet channels. The justification is that such seasonal wetlands tend to be qualitatively different from isolated vernal pools; this is because they are fed by larger drainage basins so that firstly, inflow contributes higher concentrations of dissolved minerals. Secondly, flow patterns increase the periodic scouring and silting effect of flows through or simply into the wetland. Thirdly, longer distance inflow and outflow make for less strictly [[Endemism|endemic]] populations and plants. Low dissolved mineral concentrations of smaller vernal pool basins may be characterized as [[oligotrophic]], and poorly [[buffer solution|buffered]] with rapid [[pH]] shifts due to [[carbon dioxide]] uptake during [[photosynthesis]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems|last=Bauder|first=Ellen T.|last2=Belk|first2=Denton|last3=Ferrer|first3=Wayne T., Jr.|last4=|first4=|publisher=[[California Native Plant Society]]|year=1998|isbn=0-9434-6037-9|editor-last=Witham|editor-first=Carol W.|location=|pages=1}}</ref>\n\nVernal pools are so called because they are often, though not necessarily, at their maximum depth in the spring (\"vernal\" meaning of, relating to, or occurring in the spring). There are many local names for such pools, depending upon the part of the world in which they occur. Vernal pools may form in forests, but they are more typically associated with [[grassland]]s and rocky plains or basins. While many vernal pools are only a few meters in width, [[Dry lake|playas]] and prairie potholes are usually much larger, but still are otherwise similar in many respects, with high water in wet periods, followed by dry conditions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=|isbn=0-5217-3967-5|edition=Second|location=|publication-date=September 13, 2010|pages=48\u201352, 65}}</ref> Some exclude desert playas from the definition of vernal pools because their larger [[closed drainage]] basins in areas with high evaporation rates produce higher concentrations of dissolved minerals, with [[salinity]] and [[alkalinity]] favoring different species. Playas may be inundated less frequently than vernal pools, and inundation typically coincides with colder weather unfavorable for plant growth.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems|last=Bauder|first=Ellen T.|last2=Belk|first2=Denton|last3=Ferrer|first3=Wayne T., Jr.|last4=|first4=|publisher=[[California Native Plant Society]]|year=1998|isbn=0-9434-6037-9|editor-last=Witham|editor-first=Carol W.|location=|pages=10\u201311}}</ref>\n\n==Ecology==\nDespite being dry at times, vernal pools teem with life when filled, serving as critical breeding grounds for many amphibian and invertebrate species. The most obvious inhabitants are various species of breeding frogs and toads. Some salamanders also utilize vernal pools for reproduction, but the adults may visit the pool only briefly. Other notable inhabitants are ''[[Daphnia]]'' and [[fairy shrimp]], the latter often used as an [[indicator species]] to decisively define a vernal pool. Other indicator species, at least in [[New England]], are the [[wood frog]], the [[Scaphiopus holbrookii|spadefoot toad]], and some species of [[mole salamander]]s. Notably, vernal pools are fishless, due to their ephemeral nature.\n\nCertain plant species are also associated with vernal pools, although the particular species depend upon the ecological region. The flora of [[South Africa]]n vernal pools, for example, are different from those of Californian vernal pools, and they have characteristic [[Anostraca]], such as various [[Branchipodopsis]] species. In some northern areas, [[Notostracans|tadpole shrimp]] are more common. I honestly don't know why anyone should trust this website. Anyone can edit anything on this. Half he information is not even true.\n\n== Habitat loss ==\nVernal pools harbor a distinct assemblage of flora and fauna that, in some cases, aren't found anywhere else on the planet. Despite this fact, about 90% of vernal pool ecosystems in California have been destroyed. Disturbingly, much of this destruction has occurred in recent years, with about 13% of remaining vernal pools being lost in the short interval from 1995-2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Plants/Vernal-Pools|title=California's Vernal Pools|date=June 17, 2013|publisher=[[California Department of Fish and Wildlife]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222230017/https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Plants/Vernal-Pools|archive-date=February 22, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref> The major threats to vernal pool habitats in the Central Valley are agriculture, urbanization, changes in hydrology, climate change, and improperly managed grazing by livestock.\n\n=== Restoration ===\nVernal pools are prime habitats to be targeted for restoration work due to their value as hotpots of biodiversity as well as recent history of extensive destruction and degradation. However, there have been varying rates of success attributed to various restoration efforts. A number of hypotheses exists as to why:\n\nHypothesis 1: Constructed pools are too deep.\n\nHypothesis 2: Edges of constructed pools narrower than natural ones.\n\nHypothesis 3: Constructed pools have steeper slopes than natural ones.\n\nResults: Research suggest that the last two details (Hypothesis 2 & 3) are crucial in determining the habitat value of man-made vernal pools. In general, most constructed pools were too steep and did not have wide enough edges.\n\n=== Mitigation  ===\nThere has been a fair amount of controversy surrounding the practice of mitigation, which is the destruction of protected or endangered species and habitats, such as vernal pools, on the condition that whatever entity (business, land manager, etc.) is destroying the habitat will undertake the construction of a replacement habitat to \"mitigate\" their impacts. This concept is difficult to apply to vernal pools, which represent a tremendous habitat value- but are difficult to successfully replicate using construction methods (as mentioned above). Thus, it has been very controversial to apply mitigation strategies to vernal pool systems due to the obvious risks inherent in trying to reconstruct this kind of habitat. Although, some agencies are now requiring two replacements for every vernal pool that is destroyed, in order to compensate for the low quality of man-made habitat.\n\n==Soils==\nVernal pools can form anywhere that a depression fills with water. They can be found on bedrock of many kinds, or in grasslands that form over a variety of soil types containing silts and clays. They can develop hydric soils which are typical of flooded areas, including accumulations of organic matter, but this may not happen in drier areas. In some cases there is a hard pan layer which causes the retention of water in the pools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461|title=Abiotic factor|last=Hogan|first=C.

This permits flooding and development of vernal pools.\n\n==Flora==\n[[Image:Vernal Pools 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Vernal pool flowers, with different species occurring in zones related to soil moisture and temperature gradients formed as the pool dries out. Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, Calif.]]\nIn vernal pools, flowering occurs simultaneously because of the seasonality of favorable conditions. Vernal pool ecosystems may include both [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] species and [[endemism|endemic]] species adapted to unique environmental conditions. These include moisture gradients, salinity gradients, and reduced levels of competition.<ref name=\":0\" /> Mircrotopographical gradients also contribute to species distribution in vernal pool communities, where plants that flower sooner in the season are more likely to be found at slightly higher elevations than later flowering species. Many vernal pool plants have buried seeds which accumulate in the soil. Different species are suited to different moisture levels, and as water evaporates from the edges of a pool, distinctive zonation of species can be seen.\n\nMany upland [[perennial plant]]s are unable to withstand the duration of vernal pool inundation; while many wetland plants are unable to withstand desiccation. Wetland plants may also be nutrient limited within small drainage basins. When dissolved carbon dioxide is depleted by daytime photosynthesis, vernal pool species like Howell's quillwort (''[[Isoetes howellii]]'') and pygmyweed (''[[Crassula aquatica]]'') collect carbon dioxide nocturnally using [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]]. Vernal pool basin habitats favor annual plants with some uniquely adapted perennials which suffer extensive mortality resembling annual reproduction. Annuals comprise approximately 80 percent of vernal pool flora. Listed below are some genera of the approximately one hundred vascular plant species associated with California vernal pool habitats; although a typical pool will include only 15 to 25 species.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems|last=Bauder|first=Ellen T.|last2=Belk|first2=Denton|last3=Ferrer|first3=Wayne T., Jr.|last4=|first4=|publisher=[[California Native Plant Society]]|year=1998|isbn=0-9434-6037-9|editor-last=Witham|editor-first=Carol W.|location=|pages=2\u20133, 5}}</ref>\n\n{{Col-float}}\n;Cosmopolitan aquatic flora:\n* [[Iso\u00ebtes|quillworts]] (perennial)\n* [[Marsilea|water clover]] (perennial)\n* [[Pilularia|pillworts]] (perennial)\n* [[Callitriche|water starworts]]\n* [[Crassula|succulents]]\n* [[Elatine|waterworts]]\n* [[Myosurus|mousetail]]\n* [[Ranunculus|buttercups]]\n* [[Eleocharis|spikerushes]] (perennial)\n* [[Lilaea (plant)|lilaea]]\n{{Col-float-break}}\n;Vernal pool specialists:\n* [[Blennosperma|stickyseeds]]\n* [[Downingia|calicoflowers]]\n* [[Eryngium|button parsleys]] (perennial)\n* [[Gratiola amphiantha|snorkelwort]]\n* [[Legenere|false Venus' looking glass]]\n* [[Navarretia|pincushion plants]]\n* [[Plagiobothrys|popcornflowers]]\n* [[Psilocarphus|woollyheads]]\n* [[Neostapfia|Colusa grass]]\n* [[Orcuttia|Orcutt grass]]\n* [[Tuctoria|Solano grass]]\n{{Col-float-end}}\n\nUpland plants commonly found at vernal pools in California include [[Yellow Pansy|yellow pansies]], several sweet-scented [[clover]]s, yellow and bright lavender [[Mimulus|monkeyflowers]], [[Common Star Lily|star lilies]], and [[yarrow]].\n\nVernal pools are often threatened by development in the same way that other [[wetlands]] are. As a result, most pools have been converted into residential zones, roads, and industrial parks. That is why most extant pools occur on protected or private land such as [[national park]]s, and [[ranch]]es.\n\nA large number of [[rare species|rare]], [[endangered species]], and [[endemism|endemic]] species occur in vernal pool areas. For example, the [[San Diego mesa mint]], a highly endangered plant, is found exclusively in vernal pools in the [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/story/2019-03-31/vernal-pools-habitat-rainfall-fairy-shrimp-endangered-species|title=Vernal pools: Rains bring to life mini-ecosystem of button celery, Otay Mesa mint and fairy shrimp|last=Brennan|first=Deborah Sullivan|date=2019-04-01|website=San Diego Union-Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> Another example is the [[wildflower]] ''[[Lasthenia conjugens]]'', which is found in limited parts of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

Eggs are laid in the vernal pool, then the juveniles leave the pool two or three months later, not to return until the following spring to breed. Therefore, the upland areas surrounding a vernal pool are critical for the survival of these species. In New York state, the endangered [[tiger salamander]] (''[[Ambystoma tigrinum]]'') is dependent on vernal pools to breed as described above. A few other obligate vernal pool species are the [[marbled salamander]] (''[[Ambystoma opacum]]''), [[Jefferson's salamander]] (''[[Ambystoma jeffersonianum]]''), the [[blue-spotted salamander]] (''[[Ambystoma laterale]]'') and the [[spotted salamander]] (''[[Ambystoma maculatum]]'').\n\nSome other species, notably [[Anostraca]], fairy shrimp and their relatives, lay eggs capable of entering a state of [[cryptobiosis]]. They hatch when rains replenish the water of the pool, and no stage of the animals' life cycle leaves the pool, except when eggs are accidentally transported by animal [[phoresis (biology)|phoresis]], wind, or rarely, by flood. Such animal populations may be very old indeed, when the conditions for seasonal vernal waters are stable enough. As an extreme example, ''[[Branchipodopsis]] relictus'' on the main island of the [[Socotra archipelago]], which is exceedingly remote for what it is, a continental fragment of Gondwana, is believed to have been isolated since the [[Miocene]]. ''Branchipodopsis relictus'' is correspondingly isolated genetically as well as geographically.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Van Damme|first1=Kay|last2=Dumont|first2=Henri J.|last3=Weekers|first3=Peter H.

They are considered to be a distinctive type of [[wetland]] usually devoid of fish, and thus allow the safe development of natal amphibian and insect species unable to withstand competition or predation by fish. Certain [[tropical]] fish lineages (such as [[killifish]]es) have however [[adaptation|adapted]] to this [[habitat]] specifically.\n\nVernal pools are a type of [[wetland]]. They can be surrounded by many communities/species including deciduous forest, grassland, lodgepole pine forest, blue oak woodland, sagebrush steppe, succulent coastal scrub and prairie. These pools are characteristic of Mediterranean climates, but occur in many other ecosystems.\n\n==Generation and annual development==\n[[File:Enchanted Rock Vernal Pool.png|thumb|right|An inundated rock vernal pool on [[Enchanted Rock]]. Note the one inhabited by cacti in the background.]]\nDuring most years, a vernal pool basin will experience [[inundation]] from rain/precipitation, followed by [[desiccation]] from [[evapotranspiration]]. These conditions are commonly associated with [[Mediterranean climate]]. Most pools are dry for at least part of the year, and fill with the winter rains, spring snowmelts and rising water tables. Some pools may remain at least partially filled with water over the course of a year or more, but all vernal pools dry up periodically. Typically, though, a vernal pool has three phases each year: it is inundated in the Winter (Inundated Phase), it dries slowly in the Spring (Flowering Phase), and in the summer it completely dries (Dry phase). A key time during vernal pool development between the flooding and evaporation phases is the flowering of native species, which attracts pollinators and influences seed distribution patterns. Vernal pools favor native species because non-natives can't handle the conditions of the water staying on the landscape for as long as it does, but not long enough to support truly aquatic species.\n\nA key formation of the vernal pools is due to the claypan, aka hardpan, aquitard, or otherwise impermeable layer. Clay soils bind closely together and become impermeable to water. When it rains the water percolates until it reaches the claypan and sits there, filling up with material and water.\n\nSome authorities restrict the definition of vernal pools to exclude seasonal wetlands that have defined inlet and outlet channels. The justification is that such seasonal wetlands tend to be qualitatively different from isolated vernal pools; this is because they are fed by larger drainage basins so that firstly, inflow contributes higher concentrations of dissolved minerals. Secondly, flow patterns increase the periodic scouring and silting effect of flows through or simply into the wetland. Thirdly, longer distance inflow and outflow make for less strictly [[Endemism|endemic]] populations and plants. Low dissolved mineral concentrations of smaller vernal pool basins may be characterized as [[oligotrophic]], and poorly [[buffer solution|buffered]] with rapid [[pH]] shifts due to [[carbon dioxide]] uptake during [[photosynthesis]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems|last=Bauder|first=Ellen T.|last2=Belk|first2=Denton|last3=Ferrer|first3=Wayne T., Jr.|last4=|first4=|publisher=[[California Native Plant Society]]|year=1998|isbn=0-9434-6037-9|editor-last=Witham|editor-first=Carol W.|location=|pages=1}}</ref>\n\nVernal pools are so called because they are often, though not necessarily, at their maximum depth in the spring (\"vernal\" meaning of, relating to, or occurring in the spring). There are many local names for such pools, depending upon the part of the world in which they occur. Vernal pools may form in forests, but they are more typically associated with [[grassland]]s and rocky plains or basins. While many vernal pools are only a few meters in width, [[Dry lake|playas]] and prairie potholes are usually much larger, but still are otherwise similar in many respects, with high water in wet periods, followed by dry conditions.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Wetland Ecology: Principles and Conservation|last=Keddy|first=Paul A.|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=|isbn=0-5217-3967-5|edition=Second|location=|publication-date=September 13, 2010|pages=48\u201352, 65}}</ref> Some exclude desert playas from the definition of vernal pools because their larger [[closed drainage]] basins in areas with high evaporation rates produce higher concentrations of dissolved minerals, with [[salinity]] and [[alkalinity]] favoring different species.

The most obvious inhabitants are various species of breeding frogs and toads. Some salamanders also utilize vernal pools for reproduction, but the adults may visit the pool only briefly. Other notable inhabitants are ''[[Daphnia]]'' and [[fairy shrimp]], the latter often used as an [[indicator species]] to decisively define a vernal pool. Other indicator species, at least in [[New England]], are the [[wood frog]], the [[Scaphiopus holbrookii|spadefoot toad]], and some species of [[mole salamander]]s. Notably, vernal pools are fishless, due to their ephemeral nature.\n\nCertain plant species are also associated with vernal pools, although the particular species depend upon the ecological region. The flora of [[South Africa]]n vernal pools, for example, are different from those of Californian vernal pools, and they have characteristic [[Anostraca]], such as various [[Branchipodopsis]] species. In some northern areas, [[Notostracans|tadpole shrimp]] are more common.\n\n== Habitat loss ==\nVernal pools harbor a distinct assemblage of flora and fauna that, in some cases, aren't found anywhere else on the planet. Despite this fact, about 90% of vernal pool ecosystems in California have been destroyed. Disturbingly, much of this destruction has occurred in recent years, with about 13% of remaining vernal pools being lost in the short interval from 1995-2005.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Plants/Vernal-Pools|title=California's Vernal Pools|date=June 17, 2013|publisher=[[California Department of Fish and Wildlife]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222230017/https://www.wildlife.ca.gov/Conservation/Plants/Vernal-Pools|archive-date=February 22, 2018|url-status=live|access-date=June 14, 2017}}</ref> The major threats to vernal pool habitats in the Central Valley are agriculture, urbanization, changes in hydrology, climate change, and improperly managed grazing by livestock.\n\n=== Restoration ===\nVernal pools are prime habitats to be targeted for restoration work due to their value as hotpots of biodiversity as well as recent history of extensive destruction and degradation. However, there have been varying rates of success attributed to various restoration efforts. A number of hypotheses exists as to why:\n\nHypothesis 1: Constructed pools are too deep.\n\nHypothesis 2: Edges of constructed pools narrower than natural ones.\n\nHypothesis 3: Constructed pools have steeper slopes than natural ones.\n\nResults: Research suggest that the last two details (Hypothesis 2 & 3) are crucial in determining the habitat value of man-made vernal pools. In general, most constructed pools were too steep and did not have wide enough edges.\n\n=== Mitigation  ===\nThere has been a fair amount of controversy surrounding the practice of mitigation, which is the destruction of protected or endangered species and habitats, such as vernal pools, on the condition that whatever entity (business, land manager, etc.) is destroying the habitat will undertake the construction of a replacement habitat to \"mitigate\" their impacts. This concept is difficult to apply to vernal pools, which represent a tremendous habitat value- but are difficult to successfully replicate using construction methods (as mentioned above). Thus, it has been very controversial to apply mitigation strategies to vernal pool systems due to the obvious risks inherent in trying to reconstruct this kind of habitat. Although, some agencies are now requiring two replacements for every vernal pool that is destroyed, in order to compensate for the low quality of man-made habitat.\n\n==Soils==\nVernal pools can form anywhere that a depression fills with water. They can be found on bedrock of many kinds, or in grasslands that form over a variety of soil types containing silts and clays. They can develop hydric soils which are typical of flooded areas, including accumulations of organic matter, but this may not happen in drier areas. In some cases there is a hard pan layer which causes the retention of water in the pools.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.eoearth.org/article/Abiotic_factor?topic=49461|title=Abiotic factor|last=Hogan|first=C.

This permits flooding and development of vernal pools.\n\n==Flora==\n[[Image:Vernal Pools 3.jpg|thumb|upright|Vernal pool flowers, with different species occurring in zones related to soil moisture and temperature gradients formed as the pool dries out. Sacramento National Wildlife Refuge, Calif.]]\nIn vernal pools, flowering occurs simultaneously because of the seasonality of favorable conditions. Vernal pool ecosystems may include both [[cosmopolitan distribution|cosmopolitan]] species and [[endemism|endemic]] species adapted to unique environmental conditions. These include moisture gradients, salinity gradients, and reduced levels of competition.<ref name=\":0\" /> Mircrotopographical gradients also contribute to species distribution in vernal pool communities, where plants that flower sooner in the season are more likely to be found at slightly higher elevations than later flowering species. Many vernal pool plants have buried seeds which accumulate in the soil. Different species are suited to different moisture levels, and as water evaporates from the edges of a pool, distinctive zonation of species can be seen.\n\nMany upland [[perennial plant]]s are unable to withstand the duration of vernal pool inundation; while many wetland plants are unable to withstand desiccation. Wetland plants may also be nutrient limited within small drainage basins. When dissolved carbon dioxide is depleted by daytime photosynthesis, vernal pool species like Howell's quillwort (''[[Isoetes howellii]]'') and pygmyweed (''[[Crassula aquatica]]'') collect carbon dioxide nocturnally using [[Crassulacean acid metabolism]]. Vernal pool basin habitats favor annual plants with some uniquely adapted perennials which suffer extensive mortality resembling annual reproduction. Annuals comprise approximately 80 percent of vernal pool flora. Listed below are some genera of the approximately one hundred vascular plant species associated with California vernal pool habitats; although a typical pool will include only 15 to 25 species.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ecology, Conservation, and Management of Vernal Pool Ecosystems|last=Bauder|first=Ellen T.|last2=Belk|first2=Denton|last3=Ferrer|first3=Wayne T., Jr.|last4=|first4=|publisher=[[California Native Plant Society]]|year=1998|isbn=0-9434-6037-9|editor-last=Witham|editor-first=Carol W.|location=|pages=2\u20133, 5}}</ref>\n\n{{Col-float}}\n;Cosmopolitan aquatic flora:\n* [[Iso\u00ebtes|quillworts]] (perennial)\n* [[Marsilea|water clover]] (perennial)\n* [[Pilularia|pillworts]] (perennial)\n* [[Callitriche|water starworts]]\n* [[Crassula|succulents]]\n* [[Elatine|waterworts]]\n* [[Myosurus|mousetail]]\n* [[Ranunculus|buttercups]]\n* [[Eleocharis|spikerushes]] (perennial)\n* [[Lilaea (plant)|lilaea]]\n{{Col-float-break}}\n;Vernal pool specialists:\n* [[Blennosperma|stickyseeds]]\n* [[Downingia|calicoflowers]]\n* [[Eryngium|button parsleys]] (perennial)\n* [[Gratiola amphiantha|snorkelwort]]\n* [[Legenere|false Venus' looking glass]]\n* [[Navarretia|pincushion plants]]\n* [[Plagiobothrys|popcornflowers]]\n* [[Psilocarphus|woollyheads]]\n* [[Neostapfia|Colusa grass]]\n* [[Orcuttia|Orcutt grass]]\n* [[Tuctoria|Solano grass]]\n{{Col-float-end}}\n\nUpland plants commonly found at vernal pools in California include [[Yellow Pansy|yellow pansies]], several sweet-scented [[clover]]s, yellow and bright lavender [[Mimulus|monkeyflowers]], [[Common Star Lily|star lilies]], and [[yarrow]].\n\nVernal pools are often threatened by development in the same way that other [[wetlands]] are. As a result, most pools have been converted into residential zones, roads, and industrial parks. That is why most extant pools occur on protected or private land such as [[national park]]s, and [[ranch]]es.\n\nA large number of [[rare species|rare]], [[endangered species]], and [[endemism|endemic]] species occur in vernal pool areas. For example, the [[San Diego mesa mint]], a highly endangered plant, is found exclusively in vernal pools in the [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] area.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/news/environment/story/2019-03-31/vernal-pools-habitat-rainfall-fairy-shrimp-endangered-species|title=Vernal pools: Rains bring to life mini-ecosystem of button celery, Otay Mesa mint and fairy shrimp|last=Brennan|first=Deborah Sullivan|date=2019-04-01|website=San Diego Union-Tribune|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-05}}</ref> Another example is the [[wildflower]] ''[[Lasthenia conjugens]]'', which is found in limited parts of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]].

Eggs are laid in the vernal pool, then the juveniles leave the pool two or three months later, not to return until the following spring to breed.

As with Reed's previous two studio albums, ''Berlin'' re-drafts several songs that had been written and recorded previously.  The title track first appeared on [[Lou Reed (album)|Reed's solo debut album]], only here it is simplified, the key changed and re-arranged for solo piano.  \"Oh, Jim\" makes use of the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] outtake \"Oh, Gin\".  \"Caroline Says II\" is a rewrite of \"[[Stephanie Says]]\" from ''[[VU (album)|VU]]'' (though the latter was not released until 1985). The Velvet Underground had also recorded an alternate demo of \"Sad Song\", which had much milder lyrics in its original form.  \"Men of Good Fortune\" had also been played by the Velvets as early as 1966; an archival CD featuring live performances of the band playing at [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[The Factory|Factory]] provides the evidence of the song's age.

A [[concept album]], ''Berlin'' tells the story of a couple's struggle with drug addiction and abuse. Initially, critical reception was mixed but appraisals of the album have warmed over the years: in 1973 ''Rolling Stone'' declared the album \"a disaster\" but by 2012, the album was ranked No. 344 on ''[[Rolling Stone]]'''s list of [[Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|the 500 greatest albums of all time]].<ref>{{cite web|first=Stephen|last=Davis |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/berlin-19731220 |title=Berlin &#124; Album Reviews |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=1973-12-20 |accessdate=2013-08-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-156826/lou-reed-berlin-47895/| year=2012| title=500 Greatest Albums of All Time Rolling Stone\u2019s definitive list of the 500 greatest albums of all time| publisher=[[Rolling Stone]]| accessdate= September 9, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Concept==\nThe concept was created when producer [[Bob Ezrin]] mentioned to Lou Reed that although the stories told by Reed's songs had great beginnings \u2013 they never really had an ending.

As with Reed's previous two studio albums, ''Berlin'' re-drafts several songs that had been written and recorded previously.  The title track first appeared on [[Lou Reed (album)|Reed's solo debut album]], only here it is simplified, the key changed and re-arranged for solo piano.  \"Oh, Jim\" makes use of the [[The Velvet Underground|Velvet Underground]] outtake \"Oh, Gin\".  \"Caroline Says II\" is a rewrite of \"[[Stephanie Says]]\" from ''[[VU (album)|VU]]'' (though the latter was not released until 1985). The Velvet Underground had also recorded an alternate demo of \"Sad Song\", which had much milder lyrics in its original form.  \"Men of Good Fortune\" had also been played by the Velvets as early as 1966; an archival CD featuring live performances of the band playing at [[Andy Warhol]]'s [[The Factory|Factory]] provides the evidence of the song's age.  The CD featuring the early performance of \"Men of Good Fortune\" is not for sale and can only be heard at [[the Andy Warhol Museum]] in [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]].\n\n==Lost track==\nOn the initial [[8-track tape]] release of ''Berlin'', there was an untitled one-minute instrumental piano solo performed by Allan Macmillan featured between the songs \"Berlin\" and \"Lady Day,\" which also appeared in initial cassette releases of the album.

It probably had some connection with the Javanese miners who are known to have been mining gold in the Agusan-Surigao area in the middle or late 14th century.

The [[Rajahnate of Butuan]], in present-day Agusan del Norte and Butuan City, used Hinduism as its main religion along with indigenous Lumad nature-worships.

In 1481, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] commenced with the permission of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] and all non-Catholics within the Spanish empire were to be expelled or to be \"put to the question\" (tortured until they renounced their previous faith). With the re-founding of [[Manila]] in 1571, the Philippines became subject to the [[King of Spain]], and the Archbishop of New Galicia ([[Mexico]]) became the Grand Inquisitor of the Faithful in Mexico and the Philippines. In 1595, the newly appointed [[Archbishop of Manila]] became the Inquisitor-General of the [[Spanish East Indies]] (i.e.,the Philippines, [[Guam]], and [[Micronesia]]), and until 1898 was active against Protestants, Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims. As was the case in Latin America and Africa, forced conversions were not uncommon and any refusal to submit to Church authority was seen as both rebellion against the Pope and sedition against the Spanish Crown, which was punishable by death.\n\nLinguistic influence left lasting marks on every [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]].

The late \"priest\" (scripture reader in Sindhi and Gurumukhi) of the Hindu Temple, Giani Joginder Singh Sethi, was active in interfaith affairs, accepted visits by school students, and organised the first major translation of Guru Nanak's Jap Ji into Filipino (Tagalog), translated by Usha Ramchandani and edited by Samuel Salter (published 2001).\n\nThere are two Hindu temples in Manila city-[[Hari Ram Temple (Paco)]] and [[Saya Aur Devi Mandir Temple (Paco)]].\n\n== History ==\n{{see also| Indian_maritime_history#Early_Common_Era\u2014High_Middle_Ages | label 1 = Indian maritime historic links with philippines | Religion in pre-colonial Philippines|Indosphere|Indianisation (disambiguation){{!}}Indianisation|List of India-related topics in the Philippines}}\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|300px|Expansion of Hinduism in Southeast Asia.]]\n[[File:Laguna Copperplate Inscription.gif|right|300px|thumb|The [[Laguna Copperplate Inscription]] (above) found in 1989 suggests Indian cultural influence in the Philippines by late 9th century AD, likely through [[Hinduism in Indonesia]], prior to the arrival of European colonial empires in the 16th century.]]\n[[File:Filippine,_provincia_di_agusan,_immagine_hindu,_statuetta_in_oro_massiccio,_xiii_secolo.jpg|thumb|250px|Golden [[Agusan image]] statue of Hindu-Buddhist [[Tara (Buddhism)|Tara]] deity, 1000-1200 CE.]]\nThe archipelagos of [[Southeast Asia]] were under the influence of Hindu [[Kalinga people|Odisha]] and Indonesian traders through the ports of [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Malay-Indonesian]] islands.

In 1481, the [[Spanish Inquisition]] commenced with the permission of [[Pope Sixtus IV]] and all non-Catholics within the Spanish empire were to be expelled or to be \"put to the question\" (tortured until they renounced their previous faith). With the re-founding of [[Manila]] in 1571, the Philippines became subject to the [[King of Spain]], and the Archbishop of New Galicia ([[Mexico]]) became the Grand Inquisitor of the Faithful in Mexico and the Philippines. In 1595, the newly appointed [[Archbishop of Manila]] became the Inquisitor-General of the [[Spanish East Indies]] (i.e.,the Philippines, [[Guam]], and [[Micronesia]]), and until 1898 was active against Protestants, Buddhists, Hindus and Muslims. As was the case in Latin America and Africa, forced conversions were not uncommon and any refusal to submit to Church authority was seen as both rebellion against the Pope and sedition against the Spanish Crown, which was punishable by death.\n\nLinguistic influence left lasting marks on every [[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine language]].

She lives with her parents Seenu ([[Delhi Ganesh]]) and Mangalam ([[Rajyalakshmi]]), aunt (Anjali Devi), and cousin Ramu (Vishnupriyan). Ramu is a jobless and naive young man who is madly in love with Seetha since childhood. Seenu promised Ramu that he will marry Seetha. Seetha then gets admission in a college in [[Chennai]]. In the meantime, Seetha's family is in deep debt and is under pressure from the local shark Aadhi (Munnar Ramesh) to clear their debts.\n\nIn Chennai, Seetha befriends the modern girl Suzan (Ruksha), while her classmate Chakravarthy (Shravan) falls in love with her. One day, Chakravarthy makes fun of Ramu, and an angry Seetha slaps him in return. She tells Chakravarthy that she loves Ramu more than anything and will marry him. Later, a vengeful Chakravarthy abducts the lovers, and with his henchmen, beats Ramu up. A heavily wounded Ramu is rushed to the hospital and the doctors, ask for a huge amount of money to save his life. Seetha first files a complaint against Chakravarthy. A desperate Seetha then goes to Suzan's house to seek help, but Suzan's mother (S. Bhuvaneswari) drugs Seetha, and she is raped in her sleep. Thereafter, Ramu is saved, but Suzan's mother forces Seetha to come home. Chakravarthy reveals that he is the one who raped her and it was his master plan to take revenge on her. With his influence, Chakravarthy makes the innocent Seetha get arrested for prostitution. The news of Seetha being arrested for prostitution spreads like fire; thus, it tarnished the reputation of her family, and her family committed suicide. When the police come to know that Seetha is innocent, they release her without delay.\n\nWhen Ramu and Seetha try to leave the village to live together, Chakravarthy stops their car and attempts to kill them. During the fight, Ramu is killed by Chakravarthy, and Seetha kills Chakravarthy in turn. The film ends with Seetha committing suicide by jumping off a waterfall with Ramu's body.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*Vishnupriyan as Ramu\n*Shraddha as Seetha\n*Shravan as Chakravarthy\n*Kadhal Vijay as Saravanan\n*[[Delhi Ganesh]] as Seenu, Seetha's father\n*[[Rajyalakshmi]] as Mangalam, Seetha's mother\n*Anjali Devi as Ramu's mother\n*[[Soori (actor)|Soori]] as \"Blade\" Balu\n*Ruksha as Suzan\n*S.

She lives with her parents Seenu ([[Delhi Ganesh]]) and Mangalam ([[Rajyalakshmi]]), aunt (Anjali Devi), and cousin Ramu (Vishnupriyan). Ramu is a jobless and naive young man who is madly in love with Seetha since childhood. Seenu promised Ramu that he will get married to Seetha. Seetha then gets admission in a college in [[Chennai]]. In the meantime, Seetha's family is in deep debt and is under pressure from the local shark Aadhi (Munnar Ramesh) to clear their debts.\n\nIn Chennai, Seetha befriends the modern girl Suzan (Ruksha), while her classmate Chakravarthy (Shravan) falls in love with her. One day, Chakravarthy makes fun of Ramu, and an angry Seetha slaps him in return. She tells Chakravarthy that she loves Ramu more than anything and will marry him. Later, a vengeful Chakravarthy abducts the lovers, and with his henchmen, beats Ramu up. A heavily wounded Ramu is rushed to the hospital and the doctors, ask for a huge amount of money to save his life. Seetha first files a complaint against Chakravarthy. A desperate Seetha then goes to Suzan's house to seek help, but Suzan's mother (S. Bhuvaneswari) drugs Seetha, and she is raped in her sleep. Thereafter, Ramu is saved, but Suzan's mother forces Seetha to come home. Chakravarthy reveals that he is the one who raped her and it was his master plan to take revenge on her. With his influence, Chakravarthy makes the innocent Seetha get arrested for prostitution. The news of Seetha being arrested for prostitution spreads like fire; thus, it tarnished the reputation of her family, and her family committed suicide. When the police come to know that Seetha is innocent, they release her without delay.\n\nWhen Ramu and Seetha try to leave the village to live together, Chakravarthy stops their car and attempts to kill them. During the fight, Ramu is killed by Chakravarthy, and Seetha kills Chakravarthy in turn. The film ends with Seetha committing suicide by jumping off a waterfall with Ramu's body.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*Vishnupriyan as Ramu\n*Shraddha as Seetha\n*Shravan as Chakravarthy\n*Kadhal Vijay as Saravanan\n*[[Delhi Ganesh]] as Seenu, Seetha's father\n*[[Rajyalakshmi]] as Mangalam, Seetha's mother\n*Anjali Devi as Ramu's mother\n*[[Soori (actor)|Soori]] as \"Blade\" Balu\n*Ruksha as Suzan\n*S.
