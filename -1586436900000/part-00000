Vesicles form naturally during the processes of secretion ([[exocytosis]]), uptake ([[endocytosis]]) and transport of materials within the plasma membrane. Alternatively, they may be prepared artificially, in which case they are called [[liposome]]s (not to be confused with [[lysosomes]]). If there is only one [[phospholipid bilayer]], they are called ''[[unilamellar liposome]]'' vesicles; otherwise they are called ''multilamellar''. The membrane enclosing the vesicle is also a [[lamellar phase]], similar to that of the [[plasma membrane]], and intracellular vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents outside the cell. Vesicles can also fuse with other [[organelles]] within the cell. A vesicle released from the cell is known as an [[extracellular vesicle]]..\n\nVesicles perform a variety of functions. Because it is separated from the [[cytosol]], the inside of the vesicle can be made to be different from the cytosolic environment.  For this reason, vesicles are a basic tool used by the cell for organizing cellular substances. Vesicles are involved in [[metabolism]], transport, buoyancy control,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walsby AE |title=Gas vesicles |journal=Microbiological Reviews |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=94\u2013144 |year=1994 |pmid=8177173 |pmc=372955 |doi=10.1128/mmbr.58.1.94-144.1994}}</ref> and temporary storage of food and enzymes.

These vacuoles take water from the cytoplasm and excrete it from the cell to avoid bursting due to [[osmotic pressure]].\n\n===Lysosomes===\n*[[Lysosome]]s are involved in cellular digestion. Food can be taken from outside the cell into food vacuoles by a process called [[endocytosis]]. These food vacuoles fuse with lysosomes which break down the components so that they can be used in the cell. This form of cellular eating is called [[phagocytosis]].\n*Lysosomes are also used to destroy defective or damaged organelles in a process called autophagy. They fuse with the membrane of the damaged organelle, digesting it.\nok\n\n===Transport vesicles===\n*Transport vesicles can move molecules between locations inside the cell, e.g., proteins from the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[Golgi apparatus]].\n*Membrane-bound and secreted proteins are made on [[ribosomes]] found in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]]. Most of these proteins mature in the [[Golgi apparatus]] before going to their final destination which may be to [[lysosomes]], [[peroxisomes]], or outside of the cell. These proteins travel within the cell inside of transport vesicles.\n\n===Secretory vesicles===\n[[Secretory vesicles]] contain materials that are to be excreted from the cell. Cells have many reasons to excrete materials.\nOne reason is to dispose of wastes.\nAnother reason is tied to the function of the cell. Within a larger organism, some cells are specialized to produce certain chemicals. These chemicals are stored in secretory vesicles and released when needed.\n\n====Types====\n*[[Synaptic vesicle]]s are located at [[presynaptic terminal]]s in [[neuron]]s and store [[neurotransmitter]]s. When a signal comes down an [[axon]], the synaptic vesicles fuse with the cell membrane releasing the neurotransmitter so that it can be detected by [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] molecules on the next nerve cell.\n*In animals [[endocrine system|endocrine tissues]] release [[hormones]] into the bloodstream. These hormones are stored within secretory vesicles. A good example is the endocrine tissue found in the [[islets of Langerhans]] in the [[pancreas]]. This [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] contains many cell types that are defined by which hormones they produce.\n*Secretory vesicles hold the enzymes that are used to make the [[cell wall]]s of [[plant cell|plants]], [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[Archaea]] cells as well as the [[extracellular matrix]] of [[animal cell]]s.\n* Bacteria, [[Archaea]], fungi and parasites release membrane vesicles (MVs) containing varied but specialized toxic compounds and biochemical signal molecules, which are transported to target cells to initiate processes in favour of the microbe, which include invasion of host cells and killing of competing microbes in the same niche.<ref name=\"DeatherageCookson2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Deatherage|first1=B.

During normal [[calcification]], a major influx of calcium and phosphate ions into the cells accompanies cellular [[apoptosis]] (genetically determined self-destruction) and matrix vesicle formation. Calcium-loading also leads to formation of [[phosphatidylserine]]:calcium:phosphate complexes in the plasma membrane mediated in part by a protein called [[annexins]]. Matrix vesicles bud from the plasma membrane at sites of interaction with the extracellular matrix. Thus, matrix vesicles convey to the extracellular matrix calcium, phosphate, lipids and the annexins which act to nucleate mineral formation. These processes are precisely coordinated to bring about, at the proper place and time, mineralization of the tissue's matrix unless the Golgi are non-existent.\n\n[[Endosome|Multivesicular body]], or MVB, is a membrane-bound vesicle containing a number of smaller vesicles.\n\n==Formation and transport==\n{{main|Membrane vesicle trafficking}}\n{{Organelle diagram}}\n\nSome vesicles are made when part of the membrane pinches off the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi complex. Others are made when an object outside of the cell is surrounded by the cell membrane.\n\n===Vesicle coat and cargo molecules===\nThe vesicle \"coat\" is a collection of proteins that serve to shape the curvature of a donor membrane, forming the rounded vesicle shape.  Coat proteins can also function to bind to various transmembrane receptor proteins, called cargo receptors.  These receptors help select what material is endocytosed in [[receptor-mediated endocytosis]] or intracellular transport.\n\nThere are three types of vesicle coats: [[clathrin]], [[COPI]] and [[COPII]]. The various types of coat proteins help with sorting of vesicles to their final destination.  Clathrin coats are found on vesicles trafficking between the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]] and [[plasma membrane]], the Golgi and  [[endosome]]s and the plasma membrane and endosomes. COPI coated vesicles are responsible for retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER, while COPII coated vesicles are responsible for anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi.\n\nThe [[clathrin]] coat is thought to assemble in response to regulatory [[G protein]]. A protein coat assembles and disassembles due to an [[ADP ribosylation factor]] (ARF) protein.\n\n===Vesicle docking===\nSurface proteins called [[SNARE]]s identify the vesicle's cargo and complementary SNAREs on the target membrane act to cause fusion of the vesicle and target membrane. Such v-SNARES are hypothesised to exist on the vesicle membrane, while the complementary ones on the target membrane are known as t-SNAREs.\n\nOften SNAREs associated with vesicles or target membranes are instead classified as Qa, Qb, Qc, or R SNAREs owing to further variation than simply v- or t-SNAREs. An array of different SNARE complexes can be seen in different tissues and subcellular compartments, with 36 isoforms currently identified in humans.\n\nRegulatory [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab]] proteins are thought to inspect the joining of the SNAREs. Rab protein is a regulatory GTP-binding protein and controls the binding of these complementary SNAREs for a long enough time for the Rab protein to hydrolyse its bound GTP and lock the vesicle onto the membrane.\n\n===Vesicle fusion===\n{{Further|Vesicle fusion}}\nVesicle fusion can occur in one of two ways: full fusion or [[kiss-and-run fusion]]. Fusion requires the two membranes to be brought within 1.5&nbsp;nm of each other. For this to occur water must be displaced from the surface of the vesicle membrane. This is energetically unfavorable and evidence suggests that the process requires [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and [[acetyl-coA]]. Fusion is also linked to budding, which is why the term budding and fusing arises.\n\n===In receptor downregulation===\nMembrane proteins serving as [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s are sometimes tagged for [[downregulation]] by the attachment of [[ubiquitin]]. After arriving an [[endosome]] via the pathway described above, vesicles begin to form inside the endosome, taking with them the membrane proteins meant for degradation; When the endosome either matures to become a [[lysosome]] or is united with one, the vesicles are completely degraded.\nWithout this mechanism, only the extracellular part of the membrane proteins would reach the lumen of the [[lysosome]] and only this part would be degraded.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Katzmann DJ, Odorizzi G, Emr SD |title=Receptor downregulation and multivesicular-body sorting|journal=Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.|volume=3|issue=12|pages=893\u2013905|year=2002|pmid=12461556|doi=10.1038/nrm973|url=http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/odorizzilab/katzmann2002.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIt is because of these vesicles that the endosome is sometimes known as a ''multivesicular body''.  The pathway to their formation is not completely understood; unlike the other vesicles described above, the outer surface of the vesicles is not in contact with the [[cytosol]].\n\n===Preparation===\n\n====Isolated vesicles====\nProducing membrane vesicles is one of the methods to investigate various membranes of the cell. After the living tissue is crushed into [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], various membranes form tiny closed bubbles. Big fragments of the crushed cells can be discarded by low-speed centrifugation and later the fraction of the known origin ([[plasmalemma]], [[tonoplast]], etc.) can be isolated by precise high-speed centrifugation in the density gradient. Using [[osmotic shock]], it is possible temporarily open vesicles (filling them with the required solution) and then centrifugate down again and resuspend in a different solution. Applying ionophores like [[valinomycin]] can create electrochemical gradients comparable to the gradients inside living cells.\n\nVesicles are mainly used in two types of research:\n*To find and later isolate membrane receptors that specifically bind hormones and various other important substances.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Sidhu VK, Vorh\u00f6lter FJ, Niehaus K, Watt SA |title=Analysis of outer membrane vesicle associated proteins isolated from the plant pathogenic bacterium ''Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris'' |journal=BMC Microbiol. |volume=8 |page=87 |year=2008 |pmid=18518965 |pmc=2438364 |doi=10.1186/1471-2180-8-87 }}</ref>\n*To investigate transport of various ions or other substances across the membrane of the given type.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Scherer GG, Martiny-Baron G |title={{chem|K|+}}/{{chem|H|+}} exchange transport in plantmembranevesicles is evidence for {{chem|K|+}} transport |journal=Plant Science |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=161\u20138 |year=1985 |doi=10.1016/0168-9452(85)90083-4 }}</ref> While transport can be more easily investigated with [[patch clamp]] techniques, vesicles can also be isolated from objects for which a patch clamp is not applicable.\n\n===Artificial vesicles===\nPhospholipid vesicles have also been studied in [[biochemistry]].

Vesicles form naturally during the processes of secretion ([[exocytosis]]), uptake ([[endocytosis]]) and transport of materials within the plasma membrane. Alternatively, they may be prepared artificially, in which case they are called [[liposome]]s (not to be confused with [[lysosomes]]). If there is only one [[phospholipid bilayer]], they are called ''[[unilamellar liposome]]'' vesicles; otherwise they are called ''multilamellar''. The membrane enclosing the vesicle is also a [[lamellar phase]], similar to that of the [[plasma membrane]], and intracellular vesicles can fuse with the plasma membrane to release their contents outside the cell. Vesicles can also fuse with other [[organelles]] within the cell. A vesicle released from the cell is known as an [[extracellular vesicle]]..\n\nVesicles perform a variety of functions. Because it is separated from the [[cytosol]], the inside of the vesicle can be made to be different from the cytosolic environment.  For this reason, vesicles are a basic tool used by the cell for organizing cellular substances. Vesicles are involved in [[metabolism]], transport, buoyancy control,<ref>{{cite journal |author=Walsby AE |title=Gas vesicles |journal=Microbiological Reviews |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=94\u2013144 |year=1994 |pmid=8177173 |pmc=372955 |doi=10.1128/mmbr.58.1.94-144.1994}}</ref> and temporary storage of food and enzymes.

These vacuoles take water from the cytoplasm and excrete it from the cell to avoid bursting due to [[osmotic pressure]].\n\n===Lysosomes===\n*[[Lysosome]]s are involved in cellular digestion. Food can be taken from outside the cell into food vacuoles by a process called [[endocytosis]]. These food vacuoles fuse with lysosomes which break down the components so that they can be used in the cell. This form of cellular eating is called [[phagocytosis]].\n*Lysosomes are also used to destroy defective or damaged organelles in a process called autophagy. They fuse with the membrane of the damaged organelle, digesting it.\n\n===Transport vesicles===\n*Transport vesicles can move molecules between locations inside the cell, e.g., proteins from the rough [[endoplasmic reticulum]] to the [[Golgi apparatus]].\n*Membrane-bound and secreted proteins are made on [[ribosomes]] found in the [[rough endoplasmic reticulum]]. Most of these proteins mature in the [[Golgi apparatus]] before going to their final destination which may be to [[lysosomes]], [[peroxisomes]], or outside of the cell. These proteins travel within the cell inside of transport vesicles.\n\n===Secretory vesicles===\n[[Secretory vesicles]] contain materials that are to be excreted from the cell. Cells have many reasons to excrete materials.\nOne reason is to dispose of wastes.\nAnother reason is tied to the function of the cell. Within a larger organism, some cells are specialized to produce certain chemicals. These chemicals are stored in secretory vesicles and released when needed.\n\n====Types====\n*[[Synaptic vesicle]]s are located at [[presynaptic terminal]]s in [[neuron]]s and store [[neurotransmitter]]s. When a signal comes down an [[axon]], the synaptic vesicles fuse with the cell membrane releasing the neurotransmitter so that it can be detected by [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] molecules on the next nerve cell.\n*In animals [[endocrine system|endocrine tissues]] release [[hormones]] into the bloodstream. These hormones are stored within secretory vesicles. A good example is the endocrine tissue found in the [[islets of Langerhans]] in the [[pancreas]]. This [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] contains many cell types that are defined by which hormones they produce.\n*Secretory vesicles hold the enzymes that are used to make the [[cell wall]]s of [[plant cell|plants]], [[protist]]s, [[fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[Archaea]] cells as well as the [[extracellular matrix]] of [[animal cell]]s.\n* Bacteria, [[Archaea]], fungi and parasites release membrane vesicles (MVs) containing varied but specialized toxic compounds and biochemical signal molecules, which are transported to target cells to initiate processes in favour of the microbe, which include invasion of host cells and killing of competing microbes in the same niche.<ref name=\"DeatherageCookson2012\">{{cite journal|last1=Deatherage|first1=B.

During normal [[calcification]], a major influx of calcium and phosphate ions into the cells accompanies cellular [[apoptosis]] (genetically determined self-destruction) and matrix vesicle formation. Calcium-loading also leads to formation of [[phosphatidylserine]]:calcium:phosphate complexes in the plasma membrane mediated in part by a protein called [[annexins]]. Matrix vesicles bud from the plasma membrane at sites of interaction with the extracellular matrix. Thus, matrix vesicles convey to the extracellular matrix calcium, phosphate, lipids and the annexins which act to nucleate mineral formation. These processes are precisely coordinated to bring about, at the proper place and time, mineralization of the tissue's matrix unless the Golgi are non-existent.\n\n[[Endosome|Multivesicular body]], or MVB, is a membrane-bound vesicle containing a number of smaller vesicles.\n\n==Formation and transport==\n{{main|Membrane vesicle trafficking}}\n{{Organelle diagram}}\n\nSome vesicles are made when part of the membrane pinches off the endoplasmic reticulum or the Golgi complex. Others are made when an object outside of the cell is surrounded by the cell membrane.\n\n===Vesicle coat and cargo molecules===\nThe vesicle \"coat\" is a collection of proteins that serve to shape the curvature of a donor membrane, forming the rounded vesicle shape.  Coat proteins can also function to bind to various transmembrane receptor proteins, called cargo receptors.  These receptors help select what material is endocytosed in [[receptor-mediated endocytosis]] or intracellular transport.\n\nThere are three types of vesicle coats: [[clathrin]], [[COPI]] and [[COPII]]. The various types of coat proteins help with sorting of vesicles to their final destination.  Clathrin coats are found on vesicles trafficking between the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]] and [[plasma membrane]], the Golgi and  [[endosome]]s and the plasma membrane and endosomes. COPI coated vesicles are responsible for retrograde transport from the Golgi to the ER, while COPII coated vesicles are responsible for anterograde transport from the ER to the Golgi.\n\nThe [[clathrin]] coat is thought to assemble in response to regulatory [[G protein]]. A protein coat assembles and disassembles due to an [[ADP ribosylation factor]] (ARF) protein.\n\n===Vesicle docking===\nSurface proteins called [[SNARE]]s identify the vesicle's cargo and complementary SNAREs on the target membrane act to cause fusion of the vesicle and target membrane. Such v-SNARES are hypothesised to exist on the vesicle membrane, while the complementary ones on the target membrane are known as t-SNAREs.\n\nOften SNAREs associated with vesicles or target membranes are instead classified as Qa, Qb, Qc, or R SNAREs owing to further variation than simply v- or t-SNAREs. An array of different SNARE complexes can be seen in different tissues and subcellular compartments, with 36 isoforms currently identified in humans.\n\nRegulatory [[Rab (G-protein)|Rab]] proteins are thought to inspect the joining of the SNAREs. Rab protein is a regulatory GTP-binding protein and controls the binding of these complementary SNAREs for a long enough time for the Rab protein to hydrolyse its bound GTP and lock the vesicle onto the membrane.\n\n===Vesicle fusion===\n{{Further|Vesicle fusion}}\nVesicle fusion can occur in one of two ways: full fusion or [[kiss-and-run fusion]]. Fusion requires the two membranes to be brought within 1.5&nbsp;nm of each other. For this to occur water must be displaced from the surface of the vesicle membrane. This is energetically unfavorable and evidence suggests that the process requires [[adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], [[guanosine triphosphate|GTP]] and [[acetyl-coA]]. Fusion is also linked to budding, which is why the term budding and fusing arises.\n\n===In receptor downregulation===\nMembrane proteins serving as [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]]s are sometimes tagged for [[downregulation]] by the attachment of [[ubiquitin]]. After arriving an [[endosome]] via the pathway described above, vesicles begin to form inside the endosome, taking with them the membrane proteins meant for degradation; When the endosome either matures to become a [[lysosome]] or is united with one, the vesicles are completely degraded.\nWithout this mechanism, only the extracellular part of the membrane proteins would reach the lumen of the [[lysosome]] and only this part would be degraded.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Katzmann DJ, Odorizzi G, Emr SD |title=Receptor downregulation and multivesicular-body sorting|journal=Nat. Rev. Mol. Cell Biol.|volume=3|issue=12|pages=893\u2013905|year=2002|pmid=12461556|doi=10.1038/nrm973|url=http://www.colorado.edu/MCDB/odorizzilab/katzmann2002.pdf}}</ref>\n\nIt is because of these vesicles that the endosome is sometimes known as a ''multivesicular body''.  The pathway to their formation is not completely understood; unlike the other vesicles described above, the outer surface of the vesicles is not in contact with the [[cytosol]].\n\n===Preparation===\n\n====Isolated vesicles====\nProducing membrane vesicles is one of the methods to investigate various membranes of the cell. After the living tissue is crushed into [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], various membranes form tiny closed bubbles. Big fragments of the crushed cells can be discarded by low-speed centrifugation and later the fraction of the known origin ([[plasmalemma]], [[tonoplast]], etc.) can be isolated by precise high-speed centrifugation in the density gradient. Using [[osmotic shock]], it is possible temporarily open vesicles (filling them with the required solution) and then centrifugate down again and resuspend in a different solution.

It occurred on January 7\u2013February 1, 1919, less than a year after [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|Bessarabia's annexation]] by the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]. The city it was centered on is now known as [[Khotyn]] (\u0425\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d), and is located in [[Chernivtsi Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]; in 1919, it was the capital of [[Hotin County]], on the unofficial border between Romania and the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR). The revolt was carried out by armed locals, mainly Ukrainian peasants, assisted by [[Cossack]] deserters from the [[Ukrainian People's Army]] and groups of [[Moldovans]], with some support from local [[Bolsheviks]] and [[White movement|White Russians]]. It forms part of the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]], though whether or not the UNR covertly supported it, beyond formally reneging it, is a matter of dispute. The role of Bolsheviks, which has been traditionally highlighted in Romanian and [[Soviet historiography]] alike, is similarly debated. The Khotin Uprising is therefore ambiguously linked to the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War]].\n\nAfter days of guerilla activities by peasants, a large contingent of trained partisans crossed the [[Dniester]] from UNR territory, and, on January 23, managed to capture the city, creating confusion among [[Romanian Army]] garrisons. This group then formed a \"Directorate\", acting as Khotin's unrecognized government. It aimed to change the status of the county, or of all Bessarabia, ahead of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919\u20131920|Paris Peace Conference]], but remained internally divided into pro-UNR and pro-Bolshevik factions. Within days, the Directorate was toppled by the returning Romanian Army under General [[Cleante Davidoglu]], which also began a hunt for armed peasants. Critics of the intervention count 11,000 or more as killed during arbitrary shootings and shelling of localities on both banks of the Dniester, with 50,000 expelled. Romanian Army sources acknowledge that the repression was violent, while they may dispute the body count.\n\nParticipants in the revolt were generally alienated by the UNR's inaction, dividing themselves between the [[Red Army]] and the Whites. The Khotin Uprising was closely followed by a [[Bender Uprising|raid on Tighina]], carried out by the Bessarabian Bolshevik [[Grigory Kotovsky]], whose forces came to include Khotin veterans. Such incidents secured Bessarabia for [[Greater Romania]], seen by the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] as a guarantee against communist revolution. In late 1919, the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]], coalescing various White entities, sketched out an attempt to invade Bessarabia, but  [[Odessa Operation (1920)|lost ground to the Red Army]]. The emerging [[Soviet Union]] continued to back partisans in Hotin County during the interwar, until [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina|annexing Bessarabia entirely]] in 1940.\n\n==Background==\n===Before 1918===\nThe Ukrainian claim to Khotin (or Hotin) extends back to the [[Principality of Halych]], with reports that Ukrainians had settled there before the lands fell to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)|Hungarian Kingdom]].<ref>Potylchak, p. 205</ref> The city then belonged to the [[Principality of Moldavia]], which [[Foundation of Moldavia|grew out of a Hungarian fief]], before becoming a [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|tributary state]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Imperial Russia]] began its incursions into Moldavia with the [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1710\u20131711, prompting the Ottomans to annex [[Khotyn Fortress]] and reconstruct the corresponding [[Hotin County]] into a distinct ''[[Raya (country subdivision)|raya]]'' in 1714.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 53, 63\u201364</ref> The city was finally absorbed into Russia following the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Bucharest Treaty of 1812]], during which time it was recognized by all parties as being distinct from Bessarabia-proper.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 43, 53\u201354, 63\u201364; Cazacu, pp. 62\u201363</ref> A census conducted five years later reported that 7,000 \"[[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]]\" families had been colonized into the area by Russia.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 71\u201372</ref> Immigration continued at a steady pace, and was in large part a private enterprise, with hired hands needed for the \"immense estates\" of [[Boyars of Moldavia and Wallachia|Moldo-Bessarabian boyars]].<ref>Cazacu, p. 78</ref> By 1900, Ukrainians were a likely majority of the area's population,<ref>Br\u0103tianu, p. 133; Cazacu, p. 76</ref> although no definitive count exists. According to historian Nicolae Enciu, in 1918 there were 121 all-Ukrainian villages, 52 all-[[Romanians|Romanian]], and 16 mixed.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> Khotin town was populated by [[Bessarabian Jews]], though accounts differ on their number, from a vast majority<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 18</ref> to a fifth of the inhabitants.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 26</ref>\n\nUnder Russian rule, Hotin County was incorporated with the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. Its assembly, or ''[[Zemstvo]]'', overrepresented [[Russian nobility]], in particular the rival Krupensky and Lisovsky families; in 1900, it was dominated by members of the former, including [[Alexander N. Krupensky]].<ref>Coad\u0103, pp. 214\u2013217</ref> Its control was looser from 1912, when the ''Zemstvo'' presidency went to a [[Romanian nationalist]], Dimitrie A.

Bessarabia formally reorganized itself into an autonomous [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] (RDM), headed by the former Russian envoy, [[Ion Incule\u021b]]. Incule\u021b himself noted that the region, including Khotin, needed to be defended from Romanian and Ukrainian separatism, and remain attached to a [[Russian Republic|Russian Federated Republic]].

Although Marghiloman went into the negotiations promising that \"under no circumstances would we lose Hotin\",<ref>Cancicov, p. 436</ref> the act ceded 600 [[square kilometer]]s of land to Austrian Bukovina, including parts of the county, alongside the neighboring [[Hertsa region]].<ref>Ungureanu, pp. 129\u2013130, 134</ref> Under the resulting regime, parts of Hotin that were either annexed or occupied by Austria were exploited, as a breadbasket for the peoples of Austria-Hungary. This tactic, which was enforced with Marghiloman's acquiescence,<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 52\u201353</ref> led to severe shortages by June 1918. Within months, the Hungarian military administration dissolved all soviets and offices answering to the [[Central Council of Ukraine]], only delegating authority to the reestablished ''Zemstvo''.<ref>Dubitska, pp. 67\u201369</ref> Faced with such constraints, local Ukrainians began organizing into partisan units.<ref>Fostoy, pp. 594\u2013595; Potylchak, p. 208</ref> \n\nIn April, the UNR itself was replaced by a more Austrian- and White-friendly regime, the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]], which made some efforts to extend itself into Hotin County and the \"four parishes\" of Soroca. A branch of the Ukrainian Army, including a 2nd Cavalry Division under Commandant Kolesnikov, was established in Khotin, whose civilian authorities argued that Marghiloman had willingly renounced his claims to the area.<ref>Rusnak ''et al.''. pp. 40\u201341</ref> On May 26, judge Oleksa Suharenko was appointed Khotin's ''[[Starosta]]'' by authorities from the [[Podolian Governorate]], situated across the [[Dniester]]; he never took charge, as he was soon replaced by a P.

The Austrian authorities ultimately consented to Izbytskyi's arrival, but stripped him of any real power.<ref>Rusnak ''et al.''. pp. 40\u201341</ref> By July 1918, Romanians grew alarmed about reports that Hetmanate representatives, including [[Oleksander Shulhyn]], were seeking to annex Bessarabia in its entirety.<ref>Iorga, pp. 29, 43</ref>\n\nIn November 1918, [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Germany's armistice]] changed the course of politics in the region. The unification of Bessarabia with Romania became effective the same month, when regional autonomy was dissolved. In Hotin County, control had remained notional until late autumn: on October 22, 1918, a majority of the ''Zemstvo'' voted in favor of the county's reunification with Russia,<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 17</ref> voicing their fear that the Romanian Army's presence in Bessarabia would end with annexation.<ref>Potylchak, p. 206</ref> As his final act in government, Marghiloman ordered his troops to take Hotin and Bukovina, together.<ref>Cazacu, p. 331</ref> The 1st Romanian Cavalry Division, part of the [[Fifth Army (Romania)|Fifth Army]], moved into the former region; it was spearheaded by the 3rd [[Ro\u0219iori (military unit)|Redcoats]] Regiment and the 40th Infantry Regiment, both of which were placed under General [[Cleante Davidoglu]].<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 14.

He had by then been ordered to leave the county, and was issuing his official acts from across the river, in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]].<ref>Rusnak ''et al.'', p. 41</ref> In his own proclamation from Khotin, Davidoglu insisted that \"Bessarabia was a Romanian province until 1812, and it remains Romanian land today and forever\", warning those who disagreed with him that they could leave for Podolia.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 20</ref>\n\nIn December, the UNR was reestablished, and its leaders resumed their observation of Romanian activities in Hotin County. Its [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] heard reports according to which \"all peasant, provincial, county and even district congresses\" supported the notion that Khotin belonged in a [[Greater Ukraine]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 205\u2013206</ref> UNR sources describe late 1918 as marked by a \"terror policy\", including \"shootings of mostly innocent people, the torture of women, children and the elderly, looting, bullying and violence against women [and] a broad system of denunciation\".<ref>Potylchak, pp. 206\u2013207</ref> Ukrainian peasants on the Romanian side of the border were additionally troubled by the newly adopted [[Land reform in Romania|land reform legislation]], which returned some land to owners that local soviets had dispossessed, and made other plots subject to ransom.<ref>Potylchak, p. 207</ref> \n\nReports by UNR Podolian officials noted that by December \"gangs of [[Moldovans]]\", assisted by the Ukrainians of [[Stara Ushytsia]], made random attacks on Romanian border guards across the Dniester. Following one such killing, Romanian artillery shelled Stara Ushytsia on December 24.<ref>Potylchak, p. 207</ref> UNR officials initially agreed with Davidoglu that these were \"bandit\" raids. They became reluctant when Romanians presented them with an ultimatum to hand in those responsible, and were further alienated when Romanian troops beat up an UNR border guard at [[Zhvanets]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 207\u2013208, 210</ref> However, on January 5, they refused to acknowledge an appeal by the \"Bessarabian National Union\", which asked for intervention in support of Hotin County refugees.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref> Instead, Khotin's inhabitants found support from the Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia, which reunited [[Russian nationalism|Russian nationalists]] associated with the Whites. With funds received from the [[Volunteer Army]], ''[[Polkovnik]]'' Zhurari began the training of guerillas at [[Tiraspol]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 80\u201381</ref>\n\n==Unfolding==\n[[File:Ignacy Pawe\u0142 Fudakowski - Most na Dniestrze w \u017bwa\u0144cu na Podolu (94-111-3).jpg|thumb|400px|[[Zhvanets]] and wooden bridge over the [[Dniester]], seen from [[Ataky|Atachi]] (1915 photograph)]]\nAccording to [[Transnistria]]n academic [[Piotr \u0218ornikov]], Zhurari and his Committee planned for the rebellion to ignite just before the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919\u20131920|Paris Peace Conference]], which was to analyze the issue of Bessarabia and Khotin.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 82</ref> Romanian rule was still consolidating<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> when the armed rebellion began.

However, he could not be replaced in time, and, with his aide Ressel, was the one to actually take Khotin; they had already received orders to quell any incursion or revolt \"with the greatest violence, including the complete destruction of any [rebel] locality\".<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 14\u201315</ref> Davidoglu is therefore widely seen as responsible for the bloody interlude which followed. Although Giurc\u0103 believes that Davidoglu acted \"within the confines of wartime regulations\",<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 15</ref> fellow generals, including [[Ion Antonescu]], criticized his random killing of civilians, noting that it enshrined Romania's negative image as a \"country of savages\".<ref>Popenko, p. 11. See also Meltyukhov, pp. 65\u201365; \u0218ornikov, p. 86</ref> \n\nSome such reports concentrate on looting, since his troops were generally ill-prepared for a wintertime action, lacking any winter clothing. Nicolae Coroiu of the 37th Regiment recalls that Davidoglu informed his soldiers to shoot down any armed homeowners and burn down their houses, then \"dress up in the clothes of the offending parties.\"<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> Coroiu recalls however that his troops did not shoot to kill, allowing wounded civilians to flee for safety.<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> General [[Constantin Prezan]], [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff]], approved of the violence, having issued orders that the peaceful civilians be protected, whereas \"no pity, no tolerance should be displayed\" toward rebels.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 23</ref> General Schina's initial proclamations called on local Russians and Moldovans to acts as \"Christians and good Romanians [...] for there is no sweeter, gentler and more protective country on this earth than the land of Romanians.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref> When confronted with reports of rebel atrocities, Schina pressured Davidoglu to \"corral every village, all Bolshevik gangs and rebellious inhabitants\"; if rebel activities continued, he was to set whole localities on fire.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref>\n\nSt\u0103nescu, replying on \"Romanian military documents\", notes that \"during the aggression they initiated, the Bolsheviks had about 300\u2013400 dead, with several localities whose population had supported them in their actions being destroyed in whole or in part.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Other Romanian military records, republished by Potylchak, boasted that seven rebel villages were burned to the ground, with as many as 5,000 insurgents killed; Potylchak himself counts 22 villages destroyed and 11,000 victims, including arbitrary executions of 165 railwaymen and 500 unarmed civilians.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> He also notes that estimates of 15,000 and higher are probably exaggerated.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209. See also Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, p. 123</ref> The latter claim is qualified in Smele's account: \"Ukrainian sources suggest that [...] at least 15,000 of those who did not flee were slaughtered by the Romanians.\"<ref>Smele, p. 97</ref> Similar numbers are advanced by [[Mikhail Meltyukhov]], who concludes that \"according to official Romanian data, more than 5,000 were killed\", and that \"15,000 people suffered in one form or another\".<ref>Meltyukhov, p. 66</ref> Scholars I. P. Fostoy and V. M. Podlubny also report 160 railway workers being killed, one of them through [[Death by burning|immolation]]. They note that the 11,000 total can be traced to an estimate first publicized by the [[International Red Aid]] in 1925.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 26</ref> Romanian losses, meanwhile, amounted to 369; this includes 159 killed in action, 93 wounded, and a further 117 missing.<ref>Meltyukhov, p. 66; St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nSome of murders of civilians are described in Romanian sources. According to Lieutenant Gheorghe Eminescu, his colleague, Captain Mociulschi, shot a railway [[signalman]] held responsible for assisting the partisans with their raid on Ocni\u021ba.<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> The measures were observed by McLaren and two other British officers touring the UNR; one of them is identified by St\u0103nescu as Lieutenant Edwin Boxhall of [[Naval Intelligence Division (United Kingdom)|Naval Intelligence]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref> According to Giurc\u0103, they favored the UNR and \"Ukrainian Bolshevik troops\", with reports which exaggerated the scale of repression and victimized non-Romanians, in particular Jews caught between the two sides. Petala, who was ordered to investigate Davidoglu, suggested that the McLaren group were of \"doubtful good faith\".<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 15\u201317</ref> Likewise, St\u0103nescu reads the British report as a \"complete denaturation\", with \"Bolsheviks\" being depicted as \"victims of Romanian repressions.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nInterrogated by the Romanian side, McLaren noted that Khotin had been shelled by the Romanians until a civilian delegation had declared it an [[open city]]. The occupiers, he recalled, had engaged in widespread looting and \"barbaric\" beatings.<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> He recalled witnessing one botched execution, in which a suspected robber was left to agonize for hours,<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> as well as the shooting of 53 peasants in Ned\u0103b\u0103u\u021bi.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 20\u201325; \u0218ornikov, p. 82</ref> According to his reports, several boys and old men were shot during robberies condoned by Davidoglu, while a man of unspecified age, Nikita Zankovsky, was [[bayonet]]ted in front of his family.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 20\u201325</ref> Similar accounts mention other acts of cruelty, including at Ruc\u0219in, where Major Popescu shot 12 captives after forcing them to dig their own grave, also killing any disabled men he found in civilian homes.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nBy contrast, Coroiu reports that the one robber to be executed in Khotin was a Romanian sergeant, caught looting despite an explicit ban.<ref>Moisa, p. 163</ref> McLaren's account also conflicted with a testimony by Khotin's deposed mayor, who had been imprisoned alongside the British officers. Gachikevich argued that local Jews appreciated the restoration of order, and that Romanians \"caused no harm, other than a few incidents on the city's outskirts.\"<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 17. See also St\u0103nescu, pp. 25\u201326</ref> His report was backed by similar statements from two of Khotin's [[rabbi]]s, Samuel Haiss and Nahiev I\u021bikovici, the former of whom also expressed his thanks in a letter to [[King of the Romanians|King]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 26. See also Giurc\u0103, p. 17</ref> The McLaren issue was escalated to General Prezan, who asked and obtained that the three British envoys be expelled from Bessarabia.<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 17\u201318; St\u0103nescu, p. 26</ref>\n\n==Revivals==\n===Raid on Tighina===\n[[File:Former Bender bridge after its destruction in WWI.jpg|thumb|400px|The bridge at [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]], destroyed by Romanian troops after [[Grigory Kotovsky]]'s raid]]\nOn February 2, guerilla units made a futile attempt to return at Khotin through Atachi, prompting another retaliatory bombardment by Romanian artillery units, which consequently became a systematic response to any perceived agitation.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> This approach led to conciliatory displays by the UNR. That same day, its representatives issued orders for the returning rebels to disarm, and pledge to assist with the investigation into their activities. Podolia's Commissioner declared his conviction that Romanians had no aggressive intent, and acknowledged that they were justified to be in a \"nervous mood\", with ultimatums as an ultimate \"bluff\".<ref>Potylchak, pp. 211\u2013212</ref> On February 8, Davidoglu's men machine-gunned the urban center of [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi]], killing two.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> Before the end of the month, they destroyed all bridges on the upper Dniester, to ensure that communications between Ukrainian groups were rendered more difficult.<ref>Potylchak, p. 210</ref> While Petala asked to command an expeditionary force that would establish a bridgehead in Podolia, Prezan continued to discuss the matter with UNR authorities, warning them to disarm any groups still hiding on the Dniester.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nZhurari's Whites in Tiraspol attempted to provide assistance to the rebels, but moved in too late. In early February, they reportedly acted as negotiators between armed Bolsheviks, led by the Bessarabian [[Grigory Kotovsky]], and the UNR authorities, allowing the latter to withdraw peacefully from Tiraspol.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 82, 83</ref> Kotovsky was then pushed out by French troops of the [[150th Infantry Regiment (France)|58th Infantry Regiment]], and found himself crossing into Bessarabia, where he managed to chase Romanian soldiers out of [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 83\u201385</ref> A French\u2013Romanian division-strength force, assisted by the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Polish Blue Army]], stepped in to repel Kotovsky's partisans, and reoccupied Tiraspol. Zhurari's men declared their neutrality, but nevertheless found themselves labeled as enemy troops by the French army command; they then joined the intervention forces and participated in political repression, executing among others the father of Bolshevik leader [[Pavel Tcacenco]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 85\u201386</ref>\n\nThe Khotin Uprising coincided with the final stages of the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War|Soviet Russian offensive]] into the UNR's territory, which also led to the establishment of a subordinate [[Ukrainian SSR]]. On January 25, the latter's Premier, [[Christian Rakovsky]], had effectively declared war on Romania by stating a Ukrainian Bolshevik claim to both Bessarabia and Bukovina.<ref>Basciani, pp. 133\u2013134; Meltyukhov, pp. 74\u201375</ref> By contrast, UNR Directors openly rejected \"territorial maximalism\", in hopes to obtain weapons from [[Bucharest]]; these were promised, but never actually arrived.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref> In March 1919, the Directorate moved to [[Husiatyn]], and failed to maintain a grip on Podolia. The area came to be governed by the [[Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (allegedly answering to [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]), though military control was resumed after a counter-coup.<ref>Oliynyk, p. 139</ref> In [[Dunaivtsi Raion]], veterans of the Khotin Uprising formed a Bessarabian Brigade, which restated its alliance with Russia and commitment to Bolshevism. It nevertheless refused to do battle against the UNR, and was disarmed by envoys from Husiatyn in early April.<ref>Oliynyk, p. 136</ref>\n\nAs many as 50,000 peasants from around Khotin, and some 4,000 to 10,000 armed rebels, crossed the Dniester, settling in either UNR or Soviet territories.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 209\u2013210. See also Basciani, p. 134; Meltyukhov, p. 66; Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Meanwhile, those refugees who still rejected communism appealed for support from the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]: on February 4, their \"general assembly\" in Zhvanets pleaded with the Entente to demand the immediate withdrawal of Romanian troops from Hotin County.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> Other circles in the Ukraine also embraced the cause. On February 12, the British legation in [[Odessa]] received a letter of protest from a self-proclaimed delegation of Bessarabians, which included S. M. Wolkenstein and H. M. Kudik as Khotin delegates. This text affirmed commitment not the UNR, but to Russia, depicting Romania as an \"invader\", and its culture as \"Asian\".<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2014), p. 150</ref> \n\n[[File:The two stages of Denikin's offensive (Nikolay Pomanskiy).png|thumb|300px|The two stages of [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|Denikin's offensive]], as depicted by the Bolshevik poster artist Nikolay Pomanskiy in 1919]]\nThe [[Red Army]], under [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], advanced southwards and [[Ukraine Offensive (1919)|conquered most of Podolia by April]]. The region was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR; this new regime quickly restored the Bessarabian Brigade, but purged it of political suspects.<ref>Oliynyk, pp. 135, 140\u2013141</ref> During the early days of May, Antonov considered plans for immediately \"freeing Bessarabia\" by invading through Khotin. He was finally dissuaded from ordering it by Romanian successes on the [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|Hungarian Front]], and by supply inadequacies.<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 79\u201381</ref> Ukrainian\u2013Romanian skirmishes continued over several months, just as the Peace Conference began analyzing the eastern borders of [[Greater Romania]]. Atachi's inhabitants remained exceptionally hostile to Romanian rule, and Soviet soldiers felt encouraged to fire on Romanian positions during May 30; suspicions arose in Romanian circles that an \"international battalion\" was being trained to invade Bessarabia from Mohyliv.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), pp. 64\u201365</ref> \n\nRomanians were still pained by echoes of Davidoglu's action, and knew that the Conference could recognize Ukrainian demands in Hotin County. As noted by Ukrainian historian Yaroslav Popenko: \"From the very first days of the conference, Romanian diplomats had been active in arguing that the Khotin Uprising was an attempt by the Bolsheviks to destabilize the country and spread its ideology further into Europe. Against the background of anti-Bolshevik sentiments among the major states, such an 'interpretation' of events was an extremely successful diplomatic and propaganda step.\"<ref>Popenko, p. 11</ref> Popenko also notes that this approach came to be favored by the [[Southern Russia intervention|Allied intervention forces in Russia]], who advised the UNR to settle its border issues with Romania, viewing the latter as the \"final bulwark against Bolshevism\".<ref>Popenko, p. 13</ref>\n\n===VSYuR and ''Zakordot''===\nZhurari sealed a pact with the Red Army and was allowed to leave Tiraspol unharmed; some of his men returned to Bessarabia, while others were admitted into the Red Army. Both groups may have played a part in the Bolshevik attempt to seize Tighina, on May 27, 1919 ''(see [[Bender Uprising]])''.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 86\u201388</ref> Whites, unlike communists, were generally spared by the Romanian Army, but the authorities still intervened when, in June, a ''Polkovnik'' Gagauz was caught preaching revolution to the inhabitants of [[Comrat]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Such agitation largely ceased in June, when the Romanian government allowed N. N. Kozlov and A. A. Gepetskiy to recruit Bessarabian White officers for service in the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] (VSYuR), which secured a base in Odessa and pushed Antonov's forces out of the region. Various members of the Salvation Committee proposed to [[Anton Denikin]] that they stage instead a takeover of Bessarabia, and Denikin promised to assist them after first \"finish[ing] off\" the UNR.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 88\u201389</ref> In August, [[Konstantyn A. Matsevych]], who served as UNR diplomatic representative in Romania, made a futile effort to reconcile the Directorate with Denikin.<ref>Vlasenko & Guzun, p. 31</ref>\n\nWhile acting as head of the VSYuR counterintelligence in Odessa, Gepetskiy permitted Bolsheviks to assemble, despite Denikin's [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|large-scale offensive into Russia]]. As \u0218ornikov notes, he still prioritized the Bessarabian takeover ahead of all other issues, and effectively had a truce with communist partisans.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 91\u201393, 95</ref> The All-Russian National Center, functioning in the White-held city on [[Rostov-on-Don]], maintained a claim to both Bessarabia and the Ukraine, accusing Romania and the UNR of colluding with each other to partition the area.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2014), pp. 163\u2013165</ref> Also working under Denikin's watch, N. A. Zelenetskiy began forming the 14th Infantry Division and 14th Artillery Brigade, specifically for the recovery of Bessarabia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 93</ref> \n\nDenikin's successes also rekindled partisan activity in Podolia. VSYuR's Gagauz was able to recruit some 13,000 veterans from the [[Ukrainian Galician Army]], who were then distributed to garrisons along the Dniester, ostensibly preparing to \"liberate Bessarabia\" upon the end of the [[Russian Civil War]]. In November, following Denikin's [[Orel\u2013Kursk operation|defeat at Orel]], these units were moved to assist against the advancing Red Army.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 93\u201394</ref> Gepetskiy's men were still preparing for an attack on Bessarabia, and collected 12 million rubles for this goal. These were confiscated by Kotovsky and the Red Army, which [[Odessa Operation (1920)|retook Tiraspol without a fight]] in February 1920.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 94\u201395</ref> These units included various veterans of Filipchuk's army in Khotin, including Shynkarenko and M. I. Nyagu, both of whom had command roles.<ref>Fostoy, pp. 595\u2013596</ref> Shynkarenko was later called up to fight the [[Basmachi movement]] in [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]].<ref>Fostoy, p. 596; Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 41</ref>\n\nThe Red Army allowed VSYuR survivors under [[Nikolai Bredov]] to move into [[Nova Ushytsia]], just north of Khotin. They surrendered to the [[Polish Army]], with Romania having repeatedly refused them entry.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 95</ref> From that moment on, the Soviets could form their own networks in Khotin; a Romanian diplomatic cable from June 1920 claims that 200 recruiters for the Red Army were active in the county.<ref>Basciani, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> From October, the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Ukrainian Communist Party]]'s office for foreign infiltration, ''[[Zakordot]]'', took over the task of destabilizing the Romanian presence. By 1921, they had organized a network of small-scale guerilla units, which crossed the Dniester for hit-and-run attacks on Romanian targets.<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 110\u2013120; Ponomariov, pp. 103, 108\u2013110</ref> ''Zakordot'' raids in mid 1921 resulted in the targeted murders of officials and clergymen in [[Dankivtsi|D\u0103nc\u0103u\u021bi]], [[Hinc\u0103u\u021bi|Poiana]] and [[Rashkiv|Ra\u0219cov]].<ref>Ponomariov, pp. 109\u2013110; Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 251</ref> These groups also made efforts to find and punish landowner Mo\u0219an, who stood accused of having organized violent retribution after the 1919 uprising. In August 1921, they attacked Mo\u0219an's manor outside [[Stalnivtsi|St\u0103line\u0219ti]], killing several members of his family.<ref>Ponomariov, pp. 109\u2013110</ref> Meanwhile, the anti-communist segment of the Ukrainian diaspora was strengthened by some 400 UNR refugees, some of whom found work at Hotin County's [[sugar mill]].<ref>Vlasenko & Guzun, p. 32</ref>\n\nAhead of the [[1919 Romanian general election|November 1919 elections]], Hotin County became a hub of the [[Bessarabian Peasants' Party]] (P\u021aB), which canvassed among the Jewish and Ukrainian populace. The group was the only one to submit a list, which had support from some 62% of registered voters (an additional 7.6% cast blank votes).<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, pp. 84\u201386</ref> All of the county's first representatives in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] were P\u021aB members, but represented three distinct ethnicities: [[Daniel Ciugureanu]] stood for the Romanians, Iancu Melic-Melicsohn for the Jews, and Pavel Kitaigorodski for the Ukrainians.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, pp. 84\u201389</ref> [[Romanian Police]] officials in the region reportedly viewed all Hotin deputies as \"more than suspicious\", in that they endorsed the notion of an autonomous Bessarabia.<ref>Iorga, p. 267</ref>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Kotovsky's partisan conference, 1922.png|thumb|440px|Veterans of Kotovsky's Bolshevik partisan units reunited for a conference in Soviet territory, 1922. The image reportedly includes two Ukrainian participants in the Khotin Uprising: Ya. Barchuk and P. Oliynyk]]\nThe UNR was dissolved upon the conclusion of its war with Russia in late 1921, leaving Khotin and Bessarabia to be governed by Romania, directly on its closed border with the [[Soviet Union]]. Prosecution of the 1919 rebels was pursued over several years. Rebels captured before January 23 were treated with more leniency, and made subject to trials by military courts. Examples include Alexei Borodaty and M. V. Bulkat, the latter of whom died in [[Craiova]] prison in 1924.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 25\u201326</ref> B\u0103rbu\u021b\u0103's aide S. Fo\u0219u was finally captured in 1929, and sentenced to death for his participation in Poeta\u0219's killing.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 23</ref> \n\nRomanian authorities in Hotin became widely known for their mismanagment and embezzlement, with wide-ranging consequences: in 1923, the [[Prefect (Romania)|prefect]] was under investigation for hoarding all pigs out of Hotin and selling them in Bukovina for personal gain.<ref>Basciani, p. 182</ref> Reports by the [[Ministry of National Education (Romania)|Ministry of Education]] signaled that Hotin inhabitants remained profoundly [[Anti-Romanian sentiment|anti-Romanian]]. Officials intended to subvert the trend by closing down Russian-language education and enforcing [[Romanianization]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 175\u2013176</ref> During the early 1930s, the region was more heavily impacted by the [[Great Depression]], prompting renewed activities by communist agents, but also agitation the antisemitic [[National-Christian Defense League]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 235\u2013236, 259\u2013260</ref> In May 1933, Vasily Gotinchan attempted to establish a local chapter of the pro-communist [[Ukrainian Workers' Party of Romania|Liberation Party]], but was apprehended and put on trial.<ref>Fostoy, p. 566</ref> A Ukrainian branch of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] was finally set up regionally, with Shulim Abramovich Kryvyi emerging as its chief organizer in 1939.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 58\u201359</ref> In 1938, the [[National Renaissance Front]] regime bid on subverting traditional loyalties in Bessarabia, dividing the region into larger administrative units that straddled old borders into Bukovina and [[Western Moldavia]]. As a result, Hotin County was dissolved, and its territory was assigned to ''[[\u021ainutul Suceava]]''.<ref>Basciani, pp. 342\u2013343</ref> The passage of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|antisemitic laws]] also came with targeted persecution, including the attempted expulsion of all Jews living in [[Zelena, Kelmentsi Raion|Zelena]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 333\u2013334</ref> \n\nThis episode ended in 1940, as most of Khotin was annexed to the Ukrainian SSR during the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina]]; the core areas of Bessarabia, meanwhile, formed a separate [[Moldavian SSR]]. The border between these two Soviet entities was settled on August 2, 1940 (effectively on November 4), when the southern third of Hotin County was recognized as part of the Moldavian SSR.<ref>Lavric, p. 124. See also Prodanyk, p. 28</ref> The northern regions, which remained under Ukrainian administration, had an Ukrainian plurality of 41.6%,<ref>Lavric, p. 127</ref> and were amalgamated with Bukovinan areas into [[Chernivtsi Oblast]]. As noted by van Meurs, this arrangement was due to Ukrainian officials using their \"political clout\", as a \"strong Ukrainian involvement\" had underpinned the Soviet moves of 1940.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Approval was obtained from the [[Prime Minister of Moldova|Moldavian SSR Premier]], [[Tihon Konstantinov]], but not from the Moldovan population.

Br\u0103tianu]]: \"not one uprising took place in Bessarabia that was not directly organized and supervised by communist partisans sent in from areas across the Dniester. An attack of some importance took place in late December 1918 {{sic}} and created troubles among the Ruthenian population in Hotin county; Romanian general Poeta\u0219 was killed during these fights. But aside from this insurrection, which had been long in preparation, and supported by gangs moving in from the Ukraine, there was no other movement against the union, which represented the will of an uncontested majority.\"<ref>Br\u0103tianu, p. 146</ref> Br\u0103tianu sees a direct link between the Khotin events and the [[Tatarbunary uprising|1924 rebellion at Tatarbunar]], \"also involving a foreign population.\"<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> \n\nThe non-communist orientation of at least part of the Uprising was attested as early as 1919 by another Romanian scholar, [[Nicolae Iorga]]. His diaries initially referred to the rebels as \"Bolsheviks\", before noting that they were \"in fact [UNR] soldiers\".<ref>Iorga, pp. 149\u2013150</ref> However, in 1995, St\u0103nescu referred to the Khotin affair as \"orchestrated by the Bolshevik government\", and suggests that all rebel \"commissions and committees\" had \"direct links with the Bolshevik army\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, pp. 22, 25</ref> \n\nPotylchak views Romanian historiography in both the royal period and the [[National communism in Romania|national communism]] of the 1980s as having \"reduce[d] the uprising to solely a 'Bolshevik revolt', and minimize[d] the anti-Ukrainian actions\" undertaken in its wake.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 204, 212\u2013213</ref> In his reading, the quashing of the uprising signified a \"colonial expansion\", to which the UNR could only oppose \"neutrality\", despite being fundamentally sympathetic to the rebels.<ref>Potylchak, p. 212</ref> Potylchak also proposes a critical view of post-Soviet Ukrainian readings of Khotin, in that it fails to account for the popular and spontaneous nature of the struggle and instead overemphasizes Mayevski's alleged contribution.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 204\u2013205</ref> Another Ukrainian scholar, V. Kroytor, is openly critical of the UNR's \"excessively cautious and inconsistent\" behavior in respect to Romanian maneuvers.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref>\n\n[[Soviet historiography]] and [[Moldovenism|Moldovenist]] authors focused on claims that the revolt was indicative of a brewing [[class conflict]], with Romanian authorities depicted as irredeemably [[reactionary]]; as noted by Suveic\u0103, Soviet monographs on the revolt achieved this goal by relying on autobiographical writings contributed by the rebels, and by citing [[Soviet propaganda]] from ca. 1920 as a primary source.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 34</ref> Such reviews also highlighted the connections between Khotin and Tatarbunar, but ascribed them a different meaning, as samples of \"heroic struggle\" by the \"Bessarabian workers.\"<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), pp. 34, 65; van Meurs, pp. 289\u2013291</ref> As noted by van Meurs, the proletarian component was spuriously highlighted, and the revolt described as related to the Red Army's clashes with the UNR and the Allied intervention forces. A 1976 monograph advanced the claim that Bolsheviks prepared the revolt to coincide with the Red Army's advance into Podolia, but that they could not control its timing.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 79</ref> These narratives also contradicted themselves in claiming that UNR agents had \"infiltrated the leadership of the revolt\", accounting for its ultimate failure.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 290, 293</ref> Potylchak argues that such sources also distort the truth by arguing that Romanians intervened in order to assist the UNR.<ref>Potylchak, p. 204</ref>\n\nThe earliest author to include Khotin into the Soviet pantheon was Rakovsky, in 1925; his account was expanded upon by Naum Narcov in 1940. Narcov reported the mainstream view, according to which 50,000 peasants had fled into newly conquered Soviet territory during the Romanian backlash, but, as noted by van Meurs, his count was later \"revised as 50,000 casualties.\"<ref>van Meurs, pp. 289, 292\u2013293</ref> Soviet authors then claimed that an additional 30,000 were refugees, and changed the chronological setting to argue that at least some of the flights had taken place before the uprising; this allowed them to claim that any participation from across the Dniester was in fact also Bessarabian, rather than Ukrainian.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 289\u2013290</ref> Within this setting, a dispute ensued between the official historiographers of Soviet Moldavia and Soviet Ukraine, after the former included references to Khotin into Moldavian history textbooks of the early 1950s. Unusually, these commented on the both Khotin and Tatarbunar as \"weak, isolated, ill-prepared, and mismanaged\" uprisings.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 183\u2013184</ref> The standard view was wholly replaced in 1960s works, which depicted Khotin as a \"major revolt\".<ref>van Meurs, pp. 276, 290</ref> In 1970\u20131978, a large-scale effort was made to collect and publish documents on the uprising from the various Soviet archives.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThough present in both Romanian and Soviet interpretations, any claims of Soviet participation in the Khotin revolt are reviewed with skepticism by van Meurs, who notes that the movement was local. He proposes that both the Hotin revolt, and the May 1919 skirmish in Tighina had support from across the Dniester, but that only the latter of the two was Soviet-sponsored.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 76\u201377, 289\u2013291. See also Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 65</ref> In 2017, Romanian military historian Alexandru Madgearu made a note that, despite being embraced by \"several historians\", any claim that the revolt was Bolshevik-instigated had been proven counterfactual.<ref>Madgearu, p. 17</ref> Kroytor suggests that the UNR's hesitation to assist pushed Khotin rebels to join the [[45th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|45th Rifle Division]] in June 1919\u2014thus effectively contributing to the destruction of Ukrainian independence.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346. See also Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, p. 123</ref> Even under these circumstances, UNR spies, which remained active in Podolia as it fell to the Soviets, reported that the population of Hotin County remained anti-Russian, whereas \"the majority of Bessarabia's population\" was won over by communism.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> The latter claim is partly backed by records of both the ''[[Siguran\u021ba]]'' and the Whites, though these suggest that Bessarabians were generally pro-Russian, rather than specifically Bolshevik.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 88, 89</ref>\n\nHistorian Mitru Ghi\u021biu proposes that any Moldovan resistance to communism was casually silenced by Soviet writers: \"the issue was never even up for discussion, with authorities fearing that any glimpse of the truth could bring into question the Romanian's 'boundless joy' at being 'liberated' by the Bolsheviks.\"<ref>Ghi\u021biu, p. 141</ref> Soviet authors ignored all talk of contributions by the Whites and their Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia. This connection had already been brought up in 1919 by Major McLaren. In their interviews with Romanian officials, both he and Gachikevich dismissed all accounts of Bolshevik agitation.<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> During their stay in Khotin, McLaren and Boxhall had resided with the Krupenskys. According to St\u0103nescu, this was an additional proof of continuity between Russian loyalism and the rebels of 1919, over a shared agenda of \"keeping these territories inside Russia, even if it were a Soviet Russia\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref> Researchers of various backgrounds, including \u0218ornikov<ref>\u0218ornikov, ''passim''</ref> and Ludmila Rotari,<ref>Madgearu, p. 17; Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 65</ref> have returned focus on the rebellion's connection with Russian monarchism. According to \u0218ornikov, the Whites and the communists had maintained the exact same policy on the Bessarabian question, seeing Khotin as an integral component of Russia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 79</ref> Zhurari had unwittingly served Romanian interests by relocating to Tiraspol, instead of forming his unit in Bessarabia itself, but as \u0218ornikov notes, had later built his force into one highly threatening for the Romanian grip on Bessarabia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 87\u201388</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Viorel Achim]], \"The Romanian Population Exchange Project Elaborated by Sabin Manuil\u0103 in October 1941\", in ''Annali dell'Istituto Storico Italo-germanico in Trento'', Vol. XXVII, 2001, pp. 593\u2013617.\n*Alberto Basciani, ''La difficile unione.

It occurred on January 7\u2013February 1, 1919, less than a year after [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|Bessarabia's annexation]] by the [[Kingdom of Romania|Romanian Kingdom]]. The city it was centered on is now known as [[Khotyn]] (\u0425\u043e\u0442\u0438\u043d), and is located in [[Chernivtsi Oblast]], [[Ukraine]]; in 1919, it was the capital of [[Hotin County]], on the unofficial border between Romania and the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR). The revolt was carried out by armed locals, mainly Ukrainian peasants, assisted by [[Cossack]] deserters from the [[Ukrainian People's Army]] and groups of [[Moldovans]], with some support from local [[Bolsheviks]] and [[White movement|White Russians]]. It forms part of the [[Ukrainian War of Independence]], though whether or not the UNR covertly supported it, beyond formally reneging it, is a matter of dispute. The role of Bolsheviks, which has been traditionally highlighted in Romanian and [[Soviet historiography]] alike, is similarly debated. The Khotin Uprising is therefore ambiguously linked to the [[Russian Civil War]] and the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War]].\n\nAfter days of guerilla activities by peasants, a large contingent of trained partisans crossed the [[Dniester]] from UNR territory, and, on January 23, managed to capture the city, creating confusion among [[Romanian Army]] garrisons. This group then formed a \"Directorate\", acting as Khotin's unrecognized government. It aimed to change the status of the county, or of all Bessarabia, ahead of the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919\u20131920|Paris Peace Conference]], but remained internally divided into pro-UNR and pro-Bolshevik factions. Within days, the Directorate was toppled by the returning Romanian Army under General [[Cleante Davidoglu]], which also began a hunt for armed peasants. Critics of the intervention count 11,000 or more as killed during arbitrary shootings and shelling of localities on both banks of the Dniester, with 50,000 expelled. Romanian Army sources acknowledge that the repression was violent, while they may dispute the body count.\n\nParticipants in the revolt were generally alienated by the UNR's inaction, dividing themselves between the [[Red Army]] and the Whites. The Khotin Uprising was closely followed by a [[Bender Uprising|raid on Tighina]], carried out by the Bessarabian Bolshevik [[Grigory Kotovsky]], whose forces came to include Khotin veterans. Such incidents secured Bessarabia for [[Greater Romania]], seen by the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] as a guarantee against communist revolution. In late 1919, the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]], coalescing various White entities, sketched out an attempt to invade Bessarabia, but  [[Odessa Operation (1920)|lost ground to the Red Army]]. The emerging [[Soviet Union]] continued to back partisans in Hotin County during the interwar, until [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina|annexing Bessarabia entirely]] in 1940.\n\n==Background==\n===Before 1918===\nThe Ukrainian claim to Khotin (or Hotin) extends back to the [[Principality of Halych]], with reports that Ukrainians had settled there before the lands fell to the [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)|Hungarian Kingdom]].<ref>Potylchak, p. 205</ref> The city then belonged to the [[Principality of Moldavia]], which [[Foundation of Moldavia|grew out of a Hungarian fief]], before becoming a [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|tributary state]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. [[Imperial Russia]] began its incursions into Moldavia with the [[Pruth River Campaign]] of 1710\u20131711, prompting the Ottomans to annex [[Khotyn Fortress]] and reconstruct the corresponding [[Hotin County]] into a distinct ''[[Raya (country subdivision)|raya]]'' in 1714.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 53, 63\u201364</ref> The city was finally absorbed into Russia following the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Bucharest Treaty of 1812]], during which time it was recognized by all parties as being distinct from Bessarabia-proper.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 43, 53\u201354, 63\u201364; Cazacu, pp. 62\u201363</ref> A census conducted five years later reported that 7,000 \"[[Ruthenians|Ruthenian]]\" families had been colonized into the area by Russia.<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 71\u201372</ref> Immigration continued at a steady pace, and was in large part a private enterprise, with hired hands needed for the \"immense estates\" of [[Boyars of Moldavia and Wallachia|Moldo-Bessarabian boyars]].<ref>Cazacu, p. 78</ref> By 1900, Ukrainians were a likely majority of the area's population,<ref>Br\u0103tianu, p. 133; Cazacu, p. 76</ref> although no definitive count exists. According to historian Nicolae Enciu, in 1918 there were 121 all-Ukrainian villages, 52 all-[[Romanians|Romanian]], and 16 mixed.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> Khotin town was populated by [[Bessarabian Jews]], though accounts differ on their number, from a vast majority<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 18</ref> to a fifth of the inhabitants.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 26</ref>\n\nUnder Russian rule, Hotin County was incorporated with the [[Bessarabia Governorate]]. Its assembly, or ''[[Zemstvo]]'', overrepresented [[Russian nobility]], in particular the rival Krupensky and Lisovsky families; in 1900, it was dominated by members of the former, including [[Alexander N. Krupensky]].<ref>Coad\u0103, pp. 214\u2013217</ref> Its control was looser from 1912, when the ''Zemstvo'' presidency went to a [[Romanian nationalist]], Dimitrie A. Ouatul.<ref>Coad\u0103, pp. 243\u2013244</ref> Russian dominance was again being challenged during World War I, when the northern areas of Hotin were a devastated battlefield, along with the neighboring [[Duchy of Bukovina]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 98, 106; Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> The latter was an extension of [[Austria-Hungary]], which envisioned annexing Khotin upon defeating Russia and Romania.<ref>Ungureanu, p. 121</ref> Following the [[February Revolution]], Ouatul became Commissar for Khotin, appointed by the [[Russian Provisional Government]]. His attempt to reassert control was ineffectual, as previously disenfranchised social groups began forming their own [[Soviet (council)|soviets]] and refusing to abide by central laws.<ref>Cazacu, pp. 186, 194</ref> These decreed the [[Collective farming|socialization]] of all landed estates.<ref>Fostoy, p. 594</ref>\n\nThe Provisional Government fell during the [[November Revolution]], which left Bessarabia and Khotin with an uncertain status. Bessarabia formally reorganized itself into an autonomous [[Moldavian Democratic Republic]] (RDM), headed by the former Russian envoy, [[Ion Incule\u021b]]. Incule\u021b himself noted that the region, including Khotin, needed to be defended from Romanian and Ukrainian separatism, and remain attached to a [[Russian Republic|Russian Federated Republic]]. He cited \"devastation in the land of Hotin\" as one of the main reasons for establishing a regional government.<ref>Cazacu, pp. 232, 250</ref> Ten cohorts of the newly formed [[Armed Forces of the Republic of Moldova|Bessarabian Army]] were ordered to resume control of the region.<ref>Cazacu, p. 250</ref> \n\nAlso newly proclaimed, the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]] (UNR) maintained friendly relations with the RDM and Romania. [[Prime Minister of Romania|Romanian Premier]] [[Ion I. C. Br\u0103tianu]], who still hoped to maintain the [[Romania during World War I|Moldavian Front]] against encroachment by the [[Central Powers]], hoped to bring the new regime to his side.<ref>Cancicov, pp. 204, 225, 259, 266\u2013267, 272</ref> By January 1918, the [[Imperial Russian Army]] spread out along the [[Siret River]] had divided itself into [[Bolsheviks]] and UNR loyalists\u2014the latter helped Romanian authorities by repressing the former.<ref>Cancicov, pp. 266\u2013267, 273\u2013274</ref> The [[Romanian Army]] sought both RDM and UNR approval for its subsequent incursion into Bessarabia, where it helped neutralize Bolshevik centers.<ref>Cancicov, pp. 273\u2013274</ref> In the event, the UNR agreed to recognize the RDM, but made specific claims to Hotin and [[Cetatea Alb\u0103 County|Cetatea Alb\u0103 counties]].<ref>Br\u0103tianu, p. 133. See also Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> Meanwhile, rival claims on the region were made by both the [[White movement]] and [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], both of which fomented dissent among local Ukrainians.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> \n\nIn the [[1917 Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii election|elections of November 1917]], UNR opponents in Hotin County had chosen [[Nicolae Bosie-Codreanu]], [[Nicolae Cern\u0103u\u021beanu]], and [[Constantin Iurcu]] as its delegates to the Bessarabian people's assembly, or ''[[Sfatul \u021a\u0103rii]]''.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, pp. 80\u201381. See also Cazacu, pp. 240\u2013242</ref> A UNR diplomat, [[Otto Eichelmann]], argued that there were no Hotin representatives on show in March 1918, when this legislature voted in favor of [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|union with Romania]];<ref>Iorga, p. 28</ref> nevertheless, ''Sfatul'' resolutions made specific reference to unified Bessarabia as extending \"from Hotin to [[Izmail|Ismail]]\".<ref>Cazacu, pp. 307\u2013309</ref> Following the [[Operation Faustschlag|Eleven Days' War]] against [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], the [[Central Powers]], including Austria, could impose these borders on their defeated adversaries. The Romanian presence in Bessarabia, which coincided with the start of a working alliance between the UNR and the Central Powers, stood as a \"clue that [Romanians] too are out of the war with the Central Powers.\"<ref>Cancicov, p. 286</ref> Trilateral peace negotiations began in February, when Austria announced Romanian diplomats that Bessarabia question was largely irrelevant to the Central Powers: \"the [Bessarabian] question is to be solved directly between Romania, which occupies it militarily, and the Ukrainian and Moldavian republics\".<ref>Cancicov, p. 321</ref>\n\n===Austrian\u2013Romanian\u2013Ukrainian dispute===\n[[File:Hotin issue, 1918.svg|thumb|400px|Map of the Hotin issue in 1918]]\nOn March 3, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (Ukraine\u2013Central Powers)|Treaty of Brest]] effectively meant that the UNR renounced its claims in northern Bessarabia to Austria.<ref>Cancicov, pp. 406, 409, 447; Ungureanu, p. 130</ref> Hotin County was occupied by the [[Royal Hungarian Honv\u00e9d]], on behalf of Austria, that same month. Hungarians controlled the county down to (and including) [[Ocni\u021ba]], as well as the northern extremity of [[Soroca County (Romania)|Soroca County]]; under the terms of an armistice, the Romanian Army held on to the remaining areas, including 8 villages in Hotin.<ref>Dubitska, p. 65. See also Meltyukhov, pp. 44\u201345, 52\u201353</ref> UNR\u2013Romanian relations grew more hostile in early April, when rumors emerged that the Ukrainian side had formally protested against the Romanian presence in Bessarabia.<ref>Cancicov, pp. 405\u2013406, 408\u2013409</ref> \n\nIn early May, a new Romanian government, headed by [[Alexandru Marghiloman]], agreed to sign [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|peace with the Central Powers]]. Although Marghiloman went into the negotiations promising that \"under no circumstances would we lose Hotin\",<ref>Cancicov, p. 436</ref> the act ceded 600 [[square kilometer]]s of land to Austrian Bukovina, including parts of the county, alongside the neighboring [[Hertsa region]].<ref>Ungureanu, pp. 129\u2013130, 134</ref> Under the resulting regime, parts of Hotin that were either annexed or occupied by Austria were exploited, as a breadbasket for the peoples of Austria-Hungary. This tactic, which was enforced with Marghiloman's acquiescence,<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 52\u201353</ref> led to severe shortages by June 1918. Within months, the Hungarian military administration dissolved all soviets and offices answering to the [[Central Council of Ukraine]], only delegating authority to the reestablished ''Zemstvo''.<ref>Dubitska, pp. 67\u201369</ref> Faced with such constraints, local Ukrainians began organizing into partisan units.<ref>Fostoy, pp. 594\u2013595; Potylchak, p. 208</ref> \n\nIn April, the UNR itself was replaced by a more Austrian- and White-friendly regime, the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]], which made some efforts to extend itself into Hotin County and the \"four parishes\" of Soroca. A branch of the Ukrainian Army, including a 2nd Cavalry Division under Commandant Kolesnikov, was established in Khotin, whose civilian authorities argued that Marghiloman had willingly renounced his claims to the area.<ref>Rusnak ''et al.''. pp. 40\u201341</ref> On May 26, judge Oleksa Suharenko was appointed Khotin's ''[[Starosta]]'' by authorities from the [[Podolian Governorate]], situated across the [[Dniester]]; he never took charge, as he was soon replaced by a P. Izbytskyi. The Austrian authorities ultimately consented to Izbytskyi's arrival, but stripped him of any real power.<ref>Rusnak ''et al.''. pp. 40\u201341</ref> By July 1918, Romanians grew alarmed about reports that Hetmanate representatives, including [[Oleksander Shulhyn]], were seeking to annex Bessarabia in its entirety.<ref>Iorga, pp. 29, 43</ref>\n\nIn November 1918, [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Germany's armistice]] changed the course of politics in the region. The unification of Bessarabia with Romania became effective the same month, when regional autonomy was dissolved. In Hotin County, control had remained notional until late autumn: on October 22, 1918, a majority of the ''Zemstvo'' voted in favor of the county's reunification with Russia,<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 17</ref> voicing their fear that the Romanian Army's presence in Bessarabia would end with annexation.<ref>Potylchak, p. 206</ref> As his final act in government, Marghiloman ordered his troops to take Hotin and Bukovina, together.<ref>Cazacu, p. 331</ref> The 1st Romanian Cavalry Division, part of the [[Fifth Army (Romania)|Fifth Army]], moved into the former region; it was spearheaded by the 3rd [[Ro\u0219iori (military unit)|Redcoats]] Regiment and the 40th Infantry Regiment, both of which were placed under General [[Cleante Davidoglu]].<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 14.

He had by then been ordered to leave the county, and was issuing his official acts from across the river, in [[Kamianets-Podilskyi]].<ref>Rusnak ''et al.'', p. 41</ref> In his own proclamation from Khotin, Davidoglu insisted that \"Bessarabia was a Romanian province until 1812, and it remains Romanian land today and forever\", warning those who disagreed with him that they could leave for Podolia.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 20</ref>\n\nIn December, the UNR was reestablished, and its leaders resumed their observation of Romanian activities in Hotin County. Its [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] heard reports according to which \"all peasant, provincial, county and even district congresses\" supported the notion that Khotin belonged in a [[Greater Ukraine]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 205\u2013206</ref> UNR sources describe late 1918 as marked by a \"terror policy\", including \"shootings of mostly innocent people, the torture of women, children and the elderly, looting, bullying and violence against women [and] a broad system of denunciation\".<ref>Potylchak, pp. 206\u2013207</ref> Ukrainian peasants on the Romanian side of the border were additionally troubled by the newly adopted [[Land reform in Romania|land reform legislation]], which returned some land to owners that local soviets had dispossessed, and made other plots subject to ransom.<ref>Potylchak, p. 207</ref> \n\nReports by UNR Podolian officials noted that by December \"gangs of [[Moldovans]]\", assisted by the Ukrainians of [[Stara Ushytsia]], made random attacks on Romanian border guards across the Dniester. Following one such killing, Romanian artillery shelled Stara Ushytsia on December 24.<ref>Potylchak, p. 207</ref> UNR officials initially agreed with Davidoglu that these were \"bandit\" raids. They became reluctant when Romanians presented them with an ultimatum to hand in those responsible, and were further alienated when Romanian troops beat up an UNR border guard at [[Zhvanets]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 207\u2013208, 210</ref> However, on January 5, they refused to acknowledge an appeal by the \"Bessarabian National Union\", which asked for intervention in support of Hotin County refugees.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref> Instead, Khotin's inhabitants found support from the Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia, which reunited [[Russian nationalism|Russian nationalists]] associated with the Whites. With funds received from the [[Volunteer Army]], ''[[Polkovnik]]'' Zhurari began the training of guerillas at [[Tiraspol]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 80\u201381</ref>\n\n==Unfolding==\n[[File:Ignacy Pawe\u0142 Fudakowski - Most na Dniestrze w \u017bwa\u0144cu na Podolu (94-111-3).jpg|thumb|400px|[[Zhvanets]] and wooden bridge over the [[Dniester]], seen from [[Ataky|Atachi]] (1915 photograph)]]\nAccording to [[Transnistria]]n academic [[Piotr \u0218ornikov]], Zhurari and his Committee planned for the rebellion to ignite just before the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919\u20131920|Paris Peace Conference]], which was to analyze the issue of Bessarabia and Khotin.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 82</ref> Romanian rule was still consolidating<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> when the armed rebellion began.

Historian Ion Gumen\u00e2i sees him as an actual commander of the rebel troops;<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 81</ref> a similar verdict was advanced by a collective of authors from the State Archives of [[Chernivtsi]], who suggest that Mayevski distributed arms to the Bessarabian Directorate.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, p. 122</ref> Potylchak favorably quotes academic and UNR political figure [[Dmytro Doroshenko]] denying that the revolt had any assistance from Mayevski.<ref>Potylchak, p. 208</ref> \n\nScholar Jonathan Smele argues that the UNR, \"at a critical point of the [[Soviet\u2013Ukrainian War]], could not afford to become embroiled in conflict with Romania\".<ref>Smele, p. 97</ref> An explicit order from the UNR General Staff banned the Podolia Army Corps from intervening to assist the uprising.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 123\u2013124</ref> In his memoirs, however, Doroshenko hints that the UNR's 60th Infantry Regiment was moved to Zhvanets specifically in order to help the rebel expedition, or at least to cover its retreat in case of a Romanian counterattack.<ref>Oliynyk, p. 135</ref> St\u0103nescu claims that the UNA directly assisted the rebels with constructing a makeshift bridge at Ocni\u021ba.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 23</ref> Major M.

Their reaction was not registered by the Romanian Army, who responded by capturing 16 [[Free Cossacks]] from Tiraspol as hostages.<ref>Potylchak, p. 211</ref>\n\n==Violent repression==\nOverall, Liskun's incursion was quickly rejected by the returning Romanian Army. In the early stages of the rebellion, it acted out on its previous warnings, repeatedly shelling the Podolian villages of [[Nahoriany]] and [[Kozliv, Mohyliv-Podilskyi|Kozliv]].<ref>Potylchak, pp. 208, 210</ref> During this interval, Davidoglu's troops were joined by various units, including the entire 37th Infantry Regiment, which moved from [[Bac\u0103u]] to Noua Suli\u021b\u0103, and the machine-gunners of [[B\u0103l\u021bi]].<ref>Moisa, pp. 160\u2013162; St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref> On January 28\u201330, the regrouped units, under Colonel Victor Tomoroveanu, forced rebels out of Noua Suli\u021b\u0103, Ned\u0103b\u0103u\u021bi, D\u0103nc\u0103u\u021bi and [[Hinc\u0103u\u021bi|Clisc\u0103u\u021bi]], reaching Anadol\u0219 other groups retook Ruc\u0219in and [[Rashkiv|Ra\u0219cov]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref> A [[state of siege]] was imposed in neighboring Bukovina, before troops from there could be marched into Hotin County;<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> \"already on February 1, the insurgent forces were pushed back over the Dniester, and internal rebellions were repressed\".<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, p. 82</ref> A force still answering to the Khotin Directorate was able to cross the Dniester back into Podolia, reportedly \"without losses\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref>\n\nFrom January 28, the intervention was nominally led by [[Nicolae Petala]], who had taken over from Davidoglu. However, he could not be replaced in time, and, with his aide Ressel, was the one to actually take Khotin; they had already received orders to quell any incursion or revolt \"with the greatest violence, including the complete destruction of any [rebel] locality\".<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 14\u201315</ref> Davidoglu is therefore widely seen as responsible for the bloody interlude which followed. Although Giurc\u0103 believes that Davidoglu acted \"within the confines of wartime regulations\",<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 15</ref> fellow generals, including [[Ion Antonescu]], criticized his random killing of civilians, noting that it enshrined Romania's negative image as a \"country of savages\".<ref>Popenko, p. 11. See also Meltyukhov, pp. 65\u201365; \u0218ornikov, p. 86</ref> \n\nSome such reports concentrate on looting, since his troops were generally ill-prepared for a wintertime action, lacking any winter clothing. Nicolae Coroiu of the 37th Regiment recalls that Davidoglu informed his soldiers to shoot down any armed homeowners and burn down their houses, then \"dress up in the clothes of the offending parties.\"<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> Coroiu recalls however that his troops did not shoot to kill, allowing wounded civilians to flee for safety.<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> General [[Constantin Prezan]], [[Chief of the Romanian General Staff]], approved of the violence, having issued orders that the peaceful civilians be protected, whereas \"no pity, no tolerance should be displayed\" toward rebels.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 23</ref> General Schina's initial proclamations called on local Russians and Moldovans to acts as \"Christians and good Romanians [...] for there is no sweeter, gentler and more protective country on this earth than the land of Romanians.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref> When confronted with reports of rebel atrocities, Schina pressured Davidoglu to \"corral every village, all Bolshevik gangs and rebellious inhabitants\"; if rebel activities continued, he was to set whole localities on fire.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 24</ref>\n\nSt\u0103nescu, replying on \"Romanian military documents\", notes that \"during the aggression they initiated, the Bolsheviks had about 300\u2013400 dead, with several localities whose population had supported them in their actions being destroyed in whole or in part.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, pp. 24\u201325</ref> Other Romanian military records, republished by Potylchak, boasted that seven rebel villages were burned to the ground, with as many as 5,000 insurgents killed; Potylchak himself counts 22 villages destroyed and 11,000 victims, including arbitrary executions of 165 railwaymen and 500 unarmed civilians.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> He also notes that estimates of 15,000 and higher are probably exaggerated.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209. See also Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, p. 123</ref> The latter claim is qualified in Smele's account: \"Ukrainian sources suggest that [...] at least 15,000 of those who did not flee were slaughtered by the Romanians.\"<ref>Smele, p. 97</ref> Similar numbers are advanced by [[Mikhail Meltyukhov]], who concludes that \"according to official Romanian data, more than 5,000 were killed\", and that \"15,000 people suffered in one form or another\".<ref>Meltyukhov, p. 66</ref> Scholars I. P. Fostoy and V. M. Podlubny also report 160 railway workers being killed, one of them through [[Death by burning|immolation]]. They note that the 11,000 total can be traced to an estimate first publicized by the [[International Red Aid]] in 1925.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 26</ref> Romanian losses, meanwhile, amounted to 369; this includes 159 killed in action, 93 wounded, and a further 117 missing.<ref>Meltyukhov, p. 66; St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nSome of murders of civilians are described in Romanian sources. According to Lieutenant Gheorghe Eminescu, his colleague, Captain Mociulschi, shot a railway [[signalman]] held responsible for assisting the partisans with their raid on Ocni\u021ba.<ref>Moisa, p. 162</ref> The measures were observed by McLaren and two other British officers touring the UNR; one of them is identified by St\u0103nescu as Lieutenant Edwin Boxhall of [[Naval Intelligence Division (United Kingdom)|Naval Intelligence]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref> According to Giurc\u0103, they favored the UNR and \"Ukrainian Bolshevik troops\", with reports which exaggerated the scale of repression and victimized non-Romanians, in particular Jews caught between the two sides. Petala, who was ordered to investigate Davidoglu, suggested that the McLaren group were of \"doubtful good faith\".<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 15\u201317</ref> Likewise, St\u0103nescu reads the British report as a \"complete denaturation\", with \"Bolsheviks\" being depicted as \"victims of Romanian repressions.\"<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nInterrogated by the Romanian side, McLaren noted that Khotin had been shelled by the Romanians until a civilian delegation had declared it an [[open city]]. The occupiers, he recalled, had engaged in widespread looting and \"barbaric\" beatings.<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> He recalled witnessing one botched execution, in which a suspected robber was left to agonize for hours,<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> as well as the shooting of 53 peasants in Ned\u0103b\u0103u\u021bi.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 20\u201325; \u0218ornikov, p. 82</ref> According to his reports, several boys and old men were shot during robberies condoned by Davidoglu, while a man of unspecified age, Nikita Zankovsky, was [[bayonet]]ted in front of his family.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 20\u201325</ref> Similar accounts mention other acts of cruelty, including at Ruc\u0219in, where Major Popescu shot 12 captives after forcing them to dig their own grave, also killing any disabled men he found in civilian homes.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 25\u201326</ref>\n\nBy contrast, Coroiu reports that the one robber to be executed in Khotin was a Romanian sergeant, caught looting despite an explicit ban.<ref>Moisa, p. 163</ref> McLaren's account also conflicted with a testimony by Khotin's deposed mayor, who had been imprisoned alongside the British officers. Gachikevich argued that local Jews appreciated the restoration of order, and that Romanians \"caused no harm, other than a few incidents on the city's outskirts.\"<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 17. See also St\u0103nescu, pp. 25\u201326</ref> His report was backed by similar statements from two of Khotin's [[rabbi]]s, Samuel Haiss and Nahiev I\u021bikovici, the former of whom also expressed his thanks in a letter to [[King of the Romanians|King]]] [[Ferdinand I of Romania]].<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 26. See also Giurc\u0103, p. 17</ref> The McLaren issue was escalated to General Prezan, who asked and obtained that the three British envoys be expelled from Bessarabia.<ref>Giurc\u0103, pp. 17\u201318; St\u0103nescu, p. 26</ref>\n\n==Revivals==\n===Raid on Tighina===\n[[File:Former Bender bridge after its destruction in WWI.jpg|thumb|400px|The bridge at [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]], destroyed by Romanian troops after [[Grigory Kotovsky]]'s raid]]\nOn February 2, guerilla units made a futile attempt to return at Khotin through Atachi, prompting another retaliatory bombardment by Romanian artillery units, which consequently became a systematic response to any perceived agitation.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 209\u2013210</ref> This approach led to conciliatory displays by the UNR. That same day, its representatives issued orders for the returning rebels to disarm, and pledge to assist with the investigation into their activities. Podolia's Commissioner declared his conviction that Romanians had no aggressive intent, and acknowledged that they were justified to be in a \"nervous mood\", with ultimatums as an ultimate \"bluff\".<ref>Potylchak, pp. 211\u2013212</ref> On February 8, Davidoglu's men machine-gunned the urban center of [[Mohyliv-Podilskyi]], killing two.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> Before the end of the month, they destroyed all bridges on the upper Dniester, to ensure that communications between Ukrainian groups were rendered more difficult.<ref>Potylchak, p. 210</ref> While Petala asked to command an expeditionary force that would establish a bridgehead in Podolia, Prezan continued to discuss the matter with UNR authorities, warning them to disarm any groups still hiding on the Dniester.<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref>\n\nZhurari's Whites in Tiraspol attempted to provide assistance to the rebels, but moved in too late. In early February, they reportedly acted as negotiators between armed Bolsheviks, led by the Bessarabian [[Grigory Kotovsky]], and the UNR authorities, allowing the latter to withdraw peacefully from Tiraspol.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 82, 83</ref> Kotovsky was then pushed out by French troops of the [[150th Infantry Regiment (France)|58th Infantry Regiment]], and found himself crossing into Bessarabia, where he managed to chase Romanian soldiers out of [[Bender, Moldova|Tighina]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 83\u201385</ref> A French\u2013Romanian division-strength force, assisted by the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Polish Blue Army]], stepped in to repel Kotovsky's partisans, and reoccupied Tiraspol. Zhurari's men declared their neutrality, but nevertheless found themselves labeled as enemy troops by the French army command; they then joined the intervention forces and participated in political repression, executing among others the father of Bolshevik leader [[Pavel Tcacenco]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 85\u201386</ref>\n\nThe Khotin Uprising coincided with the final stages of the [[Ukrainian\u2013Soviet War|Soviet Russian offensive]] into the UNR's territory, which also led to the establishment of a subordinate [[Ukrainian SSR]]. On January 25, the latter's Premier, [[Christian Rakovsky]], had effectively declared war on Romania by stating a Ukrainian Bolshevik claim to both Bessarabia and Bukovina.<ref>Basciani, pp. 133\u2013134; Meltyukhov, pp. 74\u201375</ref> By contrast, UNR Directors openly rejected \"territorial maximalism\", in hopes to obtain weapons from [[Bucharest]]; these were promised, but never actually arrived.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref> In March 1919, the Directorate moved to [[Husiatyn]], and failed to maintain a grip on Podolia. The area came to be governed by the [[Ukrainian Socialist-Revolutionary Party]] (allegedly answering to [[Mykhailo Hrushevsky]]), though military control was resumed after a counter-coup.<ref>Oliynyk, p. 139</ref> In [[Dunaivtsi Raion]], veterans of the Khotin Uprising formed a Bessarabian Brigade, which restated its alliance with Russia and commitment to Bolshevism. It nevertheless refused to do battle against the UNR, and was disarmed by envoys from Husiatyn in early April.<ref>Oliynyk, p. 136</ref>\n\nAs many as 50,000 peasants from around Khotin, and some 4,000 to 10,000 armed rebels, crossed the Dniester, settling in either UNR or Soviet territories.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 209\u2013210. See also Basciani, p. 134; Meltyukhov, p. 66; Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 122\u2013123</ref> Meanwhile, those refugees who still rejected communism appealed for support from the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]]: on February 4, their \"general assembly\" in Zhvanets pleaded with the Entente to demand the immediate withdrawal of Romanian troops from Hotin County.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> Other circles in the Ukraine also embraced the cause. On February 12, the British legation in [[Odessa]] received a letter of protest from a self-proclaimed delegation of Bessarabians, which included S. M. Wolkenstein and H. M. Kudik as Khotin delegates. This text affirmed commitment not the UNR, but to Russia, depicting Romania as an \"invader\", and its culture as \"Asian\".<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2014), p. 150</ref> \n\n[[File:The two stages of Denikin's offensive (Nikolay Pomanskiy).png|thumb|300px|The two stages of [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|Denikin's offensive]], as depicted by the Bolshevik poster artist Nikolay Pomanskiy in 1919]]\nThe [[Red Army]], under [[Vladimir Antonov-Ovseyenko]], advanced southwards and [[Ukraine Offensive (1919)|conquered most of Podolia by April]]. The region was incorporated into the Ukrainian SSR; this new regime quickly restored the Bessarabian Brigade, but purged it of political suspects.<ref>Oliynyk, pp. 135, 140\u2013141</ref> During the early days of May, Antonov considered plans for immediately \"freeing Bessarabia\" by invading through Khotin. He was finally dissuaded from ordering it by Romanian successes on the [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|Hungarian Front]], and by supply inadequacies.<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 79\u201381</ref> Ukrainian\u2013Romanian skirmishes continued over several months, just as the Peace Conference began analyzing the eastern borders of [[Greater Romania]]. Atachi's inhabitants remained exceptionally hostile to Romanian rule, and Soviet soldiers felt encouraged to fire on Romanian positions during May 30; suspicions arose in Romanian circles that an \"international battalion\" was being trained to invade Bessarabia from Mohyliv.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), pp. 64\u201365</ref> \n\nRomanians were still pained by echoes of Davidoglu's action, and knew that the Conference could recognize Ukrainian demands in Hotin County. As noted by Ukrainian historian Yaroslav Popenko: \"From the very first days of the conference, Romanian diplomats had been active in arguing that the Khotin Uprising was an attempt by the Bolsheviks to destabilize the country and spread its ideology further into Europe. Against the background of anti-Bolshevik sentiments among the major states, such an 'interpretation' of events was an extremely successful diplomatic and propaganda step.\"<ref>Popenko, p. 11</ref> Popenko also notes that this approach came to be favored by the [[Southern Russia intervention|Allied intervention forces in Russia]], who advised the UNR to settle its border issues with Romania, viewing the latter as the \"final bulwark against Bolshevism\".<ref>Popenko, p. 13</ref>\n\n===VSYuR and ''Zakordot''===\nZhurari sealed a pact with the Red Army and was allowed to leave Tiraspol unharmed; some of his men returned to Bessarabia, while others were admitted into the Red Army. Both groups may have played a part in the Bolshevik attempt to seize Tighina, on May 27, 1919 ''(see [[Bender Uprising]])''.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 86\u201388</ref> Whites, unlike communists, were generally spared by the Romanian Army, but the authorities still intervened when, in June, a ''Polkovnik'' Gagauz was caught preaching revolution to the inhabitants of [[Comrat]].<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Such agitation largely ceased in June, when the Romanian government allowed N. N. Kozlov and A. A. Gepetskiy to recruit Bessarabian White officers for service in the [[Armed Forces of South Russia]] (VSYuR), which secured a base in Odessa and pushed Antonov's forces out of the region. Various members of the Salvation Committee proposed to [[Anton Denikin]] that they stage instead a takeover of Bessarabia, and Denikin promised to assist them after first \"finish[ing] off\" the UNR.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 88\u201389</ref> In August, [[Konstantyn A. Matsevych]], who served as UNR diplomatic representative in Romania, made a futile effort to reconcile the Directorate with Denikin.<ref>Vlasenko & Guzun, p. 31</ref>\n\nWhile acting as head of the VSYuR counterintelligence in Odessa, Gepetskiy permitted Bolsheviks to assemble, despite Denikin's [[Advance on Moscow (1919)|large-scale offensive into Russia]]. As \u0218ornikov notes, he still prioritized the Bessarabian takeover ahead of all other issues, and effectively had a truce with communist partisans.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 91\u201393, 95</ref> The All-Russian National Center, functioning in the White-held city on [[Rostov-on-Don]], maintained a claim to both Bessarabia and the Ukraine, accusing Romania and the UNR of colluding with each other to partition the area.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2014), pp. 163\u2013165</ref> Also working under Denikin's watch, N. A. Zelenetskiy began forming the 14th Infantry Division and 14th Artillery Brigade, specifically for the recovery of Bessarabia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 93</ref> \n\nDenikin's successes also rekindled partisan activity in Podolia. VSYuR's Gagauz was able to recruit some 13,000 veterans from the [[Ukrainian Galician Army]], who were then distributed to garrisons along the Dniester, ostensibly preparing to \"liberate Bessarabia\" upon the end of the [[Russian Civil War]]. In November, following Denikin's [[Orel\u2013Kursk operation|defeat at Orel]], these units were moved to assist against the advancing Red Army.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 93\u201394</ref> Gepetskiy's men were still preparing for an attack on Bessarabia, and collected 12 million rubles for this goal. These were confiscated by Kotovsky and the Red Army, which [[Odessa Operation (1920)|retook Tiraspol without a fight]] in February 1920.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 94\u201395</ref> These units included various veterans of Filipchuk's army in Khotin, including Shynkarenko and M. I. Nyagu, both of whom had command roles.<ref>Fostoy, pp. 595\u2013596</ref> Shynkarenko was later called up to fight the [[Basmachi movement]] in [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]].<ref>Fostoy, p. 596; Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 41</ref>\n\nThe Red Army allowed VSYuR survivors under [[Nikolai Bredov]] to move into [[Nova Ushytsia]], just north of Khotin. They surrendered to the [[Polish Army]], with Romania having repeatedly refused them entry.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 95</ref> From that moment on, the Soviets could form their own networks in Khotin; a Romanian diplomatic cable from June 1920 claims that 200 recruiters for the Red Army were active in the county.<ref>Basciani, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> From October, the [[Communist Party of Ukraine (Soviet Union)|Ukrainian Communist Party]]'s office for foreign infiltration, ''[[Zakordot]]'', took over the task of destabilizing the Romanian presence. By 1921, they had organized a network of small-scale guerilla units, which crossed the Dniester for hit-and-run attacks on Romanian targets.<ref>Meltyukhov, pp. 110\u2013120; Ponomariov, pp. 103, 108\u2013110</ref> ''Zakordot'' raids in mid 1921 resulted in the targeted murders of officials and clergymen in [[Dankivtsi|D\u0103nc\u0103u\u021bi]], [[Hinc\u0103u\u021bi|Poiana]] and [[Rashkiv|Ra\u0219cov]].<ref>Ponomariov, pp. 109\u2013110; Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 251</ref> These groups also made efforts to find and punish landowner Mo\u0219an, who stood accused of having organized violent retribution after the 1919 uprising. In August 1921, they attacked Mo\u0219an's manor outside [[Stalnivtsi|St\u0103line\u0219ti]], killing several members of his family.<ref>Ponomariov, pp. 109\u2013110</ref> Meanwhile, the anti-communist segment of the Ukrainian diaspora was strengthened by some 400 UNR refugees, some of whom found work at Hotin County's [[sugar mill]].<ref>Vlasenko & Guzun, p. 32</ref>\n\nAhead of the [[1919 Romanian general election|November 1919 elections]], Hotin County became a hub of the [[Bessarabian Peasants' Party]] (P\u021aB), which canvassed among the Jewish and Ukrainian populace. The group was the only one to submit a list, which had support from some 62% of registered voters (an additional 7.6% cast blank votes).<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, pp. 84\u201386</ref> All of the county's first representatives in the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Assembly of Deputies]] were P\u021aB members, but represented three distinct ethnicities: [[Daniel Ciugureanu]] stood for the Romanians, Iancu Melic-Melicsohn for the Jews, and Pavel Kitaigorodski for the Ukrainians.<ref>Gumen\u00e2i, pp. 84\u201389</ref> [[Romanian Police]] officials in the region reportedly viewed all Hotin deputies as \"more than suspicious\", in that they endorsed the notion of an autonomous Bessarabia.<ref>Iorga, p. 267</ref>\n\n===Later history===\n[[File:Kotovsky's partisan conference, 1922.png|thumb|440px|Veterans of Kotovsky's Bolshevik partisan units reunited for a conference in Soviet territory, 1922.

Oliynyk]]\nThe UNR was dissolved upon the conclusion of its war with Russia in late 1921, leaving Khotin and Bessarabia to be governed by Romania, directly on its closed border with the [[Soviet Union]]. Prosecution of the 1919 rebels was pursued over several years. Rebels captured before January 23 were treated with more leniency, and made subject to trials by military courts. Examples include Alexei Borodaty and M. V. Bulkat, the latter of whom died in [[Craiova]] prison in 1924.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 25\u201326</ref> B\u0103rbu\u021b\u0103's aide S.

Officials intended to subvert the trend by closing down Russian-language education and enforcing [[Romanianization]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 175\u2013176</ref> During the early 1930s, the region was more heavily impacted by the [[Great Depression]], prompting renewed activities by communist agents, but also agitation the antisemitic [[National-Christian Defense League]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 235\u2013236, 259\u2013260</ref> In May 1933, Vasily Gotinchan attempted to establish a local chapter of the pro-communist [[Ukrainian Workers' Party of Romania|Liberation Party]], but was apprehended and put on trial.<ref>Fostoy, p. 566</ref> A Ukrainian branch of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] was finally set up regionally, with Shulim Abramovich Kryvyi emerging as its chief organizer in 1939.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 58\u201359</ref> In 1938, the [[National Renaissance Front]] regime bid on subverting traditional loyalties in Bessarabia, dividing the region into larger administrative units that straddled old borders into Bukovina and [[Western Moldavia]]. As a result, Hotin County was dissolved, and its territory was assigned to ''[[\u021ainutul Suceava]]''.<ref>Basciani, pp. 342\u2013343</ref> The passage of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|antisemitic laws]] also came with targeted persecution, including the attempted expulsion of all Jews living in [[Zelena, Kelmentsi Raion|Zelena]].<ref>Basciani, pp. 333\u2013334</ref> \n\nThis episode ended in 1940, as most of Khotin was annexed to the Ukrainian SSR during the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and northern Bukovina]]; the core areas of Bessarabia, meanwhile, formed a separate [[Moldavian SSR]]. The border between these two Soviet entities was settled on August 2, 1940 (effectively on November 4), when the southern third of Hotin County was recognized as part of the Moldavian SSR.<ref>Lavric, p. 124. See also Prodanyk, p. 28</ref> The northern regions, which remained under Ukrainian administration, had an Ukrainian plurality of 41.6%,<ref>Lavric, p. 127</ref> and were amalgamated with Bukovinan areas into [[Chernivtsi Oblast]]. As noted by van Meurs, this arrangement was due to Ukrainian officials using their \"political clout\", as a \"strong Ukrainian involvement\" had underpinned the Soviet moves of 1940.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 87\u201388</ref> Approval was obtained from the [[Prime Minister of Moldova|Moldavian SSR Premier]], [[Tihon Konstantinov]], but not from the Moldovan population.

From September 4, 1941, Hotin County was attached to a Romanian Governorate of Bukovina.<ref>Deletant, pp. 83, 305, 318\u2013319</ref> Shortly before this formal reoccupation, Romanian troops in Atachi tried to [[Holocaust in Romania|expel the entire Jewish population]] from Hotin County into ''[[Reichskommissariat Ukraine]]'', a matter which caused tension between them and [[Nazi Germany]]. More than 1,000 \"slow-moving\" Jews where shot by the ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' during the subsequent push-back.<ref>Deletant, pp. 150\u2013151</ref> All surviving returnees were then expelled into camps in [[Transnistria Governorate]], with many more killed by the Romanian Army on the way there.<ref>Deletant, pp. 151\u2013154; Fostoy & Podlubny, pp. 75\u201378</ref> The Governorate was also set to welcome the entire Ukrainian and [[Lipovans|Lipovan]] population of Bessarabia, in exchange for any Romanian-speakers on that side.<ref>Achim, pp. 594, 603, 606, 610\u2013611, 614\u2013617</ref> Antonescu and his favorite demographer, [[Sabin Manuil\u0103]], viewed the Dniester as a defensible frontier, but agreed to relinquish northern Hotin and [[Cern\u0103u\u021bi County|Cern\u0103u\u021bi counties]] to a Ukrainian state, in exchange for [[Pokuttya]].<ref>Achim, pp. 601, 604, 611, 616</ref> Ukrainian culture was banned, and its advocates were forced to assimilate or be marginalized.<ref>Fostoy & Podlubny, p. 77</ref>\n\nUnder the Antonescu regime, [[Soviet partisans|pro-Soviet resistance]] was mounted by the ''[[Komsomol]]'', which attempted sabotage and assassination.

Br\u0103tianu]]: \"not one uprising took place in Bessarabia that was not directly organized and supervised by communist partisans sent in from areas across the Dniester. An attack of some importance took place in late December 1918 {{sic}} and created troubles among the Ruthenian population in Hotin county; Romanian general Poeta\u0219 was killed during these fights. But aside from this insurrection, which had been long in preparation, and supported by gangs moving in from the Ukraine, there was no other movement against the union, which represented the will of an uncontested majority.\"<ref>Br\u0103tianu, p. 146</ref> Br\u0103tianu sees a direct link between the Khotin events and the [[Tatarbunary uprising|1924 rebellion at Tatarbunar]], \"also involving a foreign population.\"<ref>Br\u0103tianu, pp. 165\u2013166</ref> \n\nThe non-communist orientation of at least part of the Uprising was attested as early as 1919 by another Romanian scholar, [[Nicolae Iorga]]. His diaries initially referred to the rebels as \"Bolsheviks\", before noting that they were \"in fact [UNR] soldiers\".<ref>Iorga, pp. 149\u2013150</ref> However, in 1995, St\u0103nescu referred to the Khotin affair as \"orchestrated by the Bolshevik government\", and suggests that all rebel \"commissions and committees\" had \"direct links with the Bolshevik army\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, pp. 22, 25</ref> \n\nPotylchak views Romanian historiography in both the royal period and the [[National communism in Romania|national communism]] of the 1980s as having \"reduce[d] the uprising to solely a 'Bolshevik revolt', and minimize[d] the anti-Ukrainian actions\" undertaken in its wake.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 204, 212\u2013213</ref> In his reading, the quashing of the uprising signified a \"colonial expansion\", to which the UNR could only oppose \"neutrality\", despite being fundamentally sympathetic to the rebels.<ref>Potylchak, p. 212</ref> Potylchak also proposes a critical view of post-Soviet Ukrainian readings of Khotin, in that it fails to account for the popular and spontaneous nature of the struggle and instead overemphasizes Mayevski's alleged contribution.<ref>Potylchak, pp. 204\u2013205</ref> Another Ukrainian scholar, V. Kroytor, is openly critical of the UNR's \"excessively cautious and inconsistent\" behavior in respect to Romanian maneuvers.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346</ref>\n\n[[Soviet historiography]] and [[Moldovenism|Moldovenist]] authors focused on claims that the revolt was indicative of a brewing [[class conflict]], with Romanian authorities depicted as irredeemably [[reactionary]]; as noted by Suveic\u0103, Soviet monographs on the revolt achieved this goal by relying on autobiographical writings contributed by the rebels, and by citing [[Soviet propaganda]] from ca. 1920 as a primary source.<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 34</ref> Such reviews also highlighted the connections between Khotin and Tatarbunar, but ascribed them a different meaning, as samples of \"heroic struggle\" by the \"Bessarabian workers.\"<ref>Suveic\u0103 (2010), pp. 34, 65; van Meurs, pp. 289\u2013291</ref> As noted by van Meurs, the proletarian component was spuriously highlighted, and the revolt described as related to the Red Army's clashes with the UNR and the Allied intervention forces. A 1976 monograph advanced the claim that Bolsheviks prepared the revolt to coincide with the Red Army's advance into Podolia, but that they could not control its timing.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 79</ref> These narratives also contradicted themselves in claiming that UNR agents had \"infiltrated the leadership of the revolt\", accounting for its ultimate failure.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 290, 293</ref> Potylchak argues that such sources also distort the truth by arguing that Romanians intervened in order to assist the UNR.<ref>Potylchak, p. 204</ref>\n\nThe earliest author to include Khotin into the Soviet pantheon was Rakovsky, in 1925; his account was expanded upon by Naum Narcov in 1940. Narcov reported the mainstream view, according to which 50,000 peasants had fled into newly conquered Soviet territory during the Romanian backlash, but, as noted by van Meurs, his count was later \"revised as 50,000 casualties.\"<ref>van Meurs, pp. 289, 292\u2013293</ref> Soviet authors then claimed that an additional 30,000 were refugees, and changed the chronological setting to argue that at least some of the flights had taken place before the uprising; this allowed them to claim that any participation from across the Dniester was in fact also Bessarabian, rather than Ukrainian.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 289\u2013290</ref> Within this setting, a dispute ensued between the official historiographers of Soviet Moldavia and Soviet Ukraine, after the former included references to Khotin into Moldavian history textbooks of the early 1950s. Unusually, these commented on the both Khotin and Tatarbunar as \"weak, isolated, ill-prepared, and mismanaged\" uprisings.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 183\u2013184</ref> The standard view was wholly replaced in 1960s works, which depicted Khotin as a \"major revolt\".<ref>van Meurs, pp. 276, 290</ref> In 1970\u20131978, a large-scale effort was made to collect and publish documents on the uprising from the various Soviet archives.<ref>Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, pp. 123\u2013124</ref>\n\nThough present in both Romanian and Soviet interpretations, any claims of Soviet participation in the Khotin revolt are reviewed with skepticism by van Meurs, who notes that the movement was local. He proposes that both the Hotin revolt, and the May 1919 skirmish in Tighina had support from across the Dniester, but that only the latter of the two was Soviet-sponsored.<ref>van Meurs, pp. 76\u201377, 289\u2013291. See also Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 65</ref> In 2017, Romanian military historian Alexandru Madgearu made a note that, despite being embraced by \"several historians\", any claim that the revolt was Bolshevik-instigated had been proven counterfactual.<ref>Madgearu, p. 17</ref> Kroytor suggests that the UNR's hesitation to assist pushed Khotin rebels to join the [[45th Rifle Division (Soviet Union)|45th Rifle Division]] in June 1919\u2014thus effectively contributing to the destruction of Ukrainian independence.<ref>Stopchak, p. 346. See also Rinzhuk & Avdeyev, p. 123</ref> Even under these circumstances, UNR spies, which remained active in Podolia as it fell to the Soviets, reported that the population of Hotin County remained anti-Russian, whereas \"the majority of Bessarabia's population\" was won over by communism.<ref>Potylchak, p. 209</ref> The latter claim is partly backed by records of both the ''[[Siguran\u021ba]]'' and the Whites, though these suggest that Bessarabians were generally pro-Russian, rather than specifically Bolshevik.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 88, 89</ref>\n\nHistorian Mitru Ghi\u021biu proposes that any Moldovan resistance to communism was casually silenced by Soviet writers: \"the issue was never even up for discussion, with authorities fearing that any glimpse of the truth could bring into question the Romanian's 'boundless joy' at being 'liberated' by the Bolsheviks.\"<ref>Ghi\u021biu, p. 141</ref> Soviet authors ignored all talk of contributions by the Whites and their Committee for the Salvation of Bessarabia. This connection had already been brought up in 1919 by Major McLaren. In their interviews with Romanian officials, both he and Gachikevich dismissed all accounts of Bolshevik agitation.<ref>Giurc\u0103, p. 16</ref> During their stay in Khotin, McLaren and Boxhall had resided with the Krupenskys. According to St\u0103nescu, this was an additional proof of continuity between Russian loyalism and the rebels of 1919, over a shared agenda of \"keeping these territories inside Russia, even if it were a Soviet Russia\".<ref>St\u0103nescu, p. 25</ref> Researchers of various backgrounds, including \u0218ornikov<ref>\u0218ornikov, ''passim''</ref> and Ludmila Rotari,<ref>Madgearu, p. 17; Suveic\u0103 (2010), p. 65</ref> have returned focus on the rebellion's connection with Russian monarchism. According to \u0218ornikov, the Whites and the communists had maintained the exact same policy on the Bessarabian question, seeing Khotin as an integral component of Russia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, p. 79</ref> Zhurari had unwittingly served Romanian interests by relocating to Tiraspol, instead of forming his unit in Bessarabia itself, but as \u0218ornikov notes, had later built his force into one highly threatening for the Romanian grip on Bessarabia.<ref>\u0218ornikov, pp. 87\u201388</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Viorel Achim]], \"The Romanian Population Exchange Project Elaborated by Sabin Manuil\u0103 in October 1941\", in ''Annali dell'Istituto Storico Italo-germanico in Trento'', Vol. XXVII, 2001, pp. 593\u2013617.\n*Alberto Basciani, ''La difficile unione.

It is a notable feat of civil engineering, having been called an \"engineering masterpiece.\"<ref name=\"HERALD\">{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/transport/news/article.cfm?c_id=97&objectid=10526022 |title=Steel backbone an economic lifeline |author=Dearnaley, Mathew |date=9 August 2008 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref> The Institute of Professional Engineers (NZ) has designated the spiral as a significant Engineering heritage site.<ref>[http://www.ipenz.org.nz/heritage/itemdetail.cfm?itemid=2173 IPENZ]</ref>\n[[File:Raurimu rail stop.jpg|thumb|Raurimu railway station]]\n\n== Background ==\nDuring the construction of the central section of the North Island Main Trunk railway between [[Wellington]] and [[Auckland]], a major obstacle arose: how to cross the steep slopes between the [[North Island Volcanic Plateau]] to the east and the valleys and [[gorge]]s of the [[Whanganui River]] to the west? \n[[File:Raurimu Spiral map.png|right|thumb|Map of the spiral, from [[OpenStreetMap]]]]\n\nSouth of [[Taumarunui]], the [[terrain]] is steep but not unmanageable, with the exception of the stretch between [[Raurimu]] and [[National Park, New Zealand|National Park]], where the land rises too steeply for a direct rail route. A direct line between these two points would rise {{convert|200|m}} in a distance of some {{convert|5|km}}, a [[gradient]] of 1 in 24. The area was thoroughly surveyed during the 1880s in an attempt to find a route with a lesser grade, but the only viable possibility seemed to require a {{convert|20|km|adj=on}} detour and nine massive viaducts. Even then, the gradient would have been over 1 in 50.\n\n== Construction ==\nThe problem was solved in 1898 by a since forgotten PWD surveyor in the employ of [[Robert Holmes (engineer)|Robert Holmes]], [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]] engineer. He proposed a line that looped back upon itself and then spiralled around with the aid of tunnels and bridges, rising at a gradient of 1 in 52. Though costly and labour-intensive, the scheme was still cheaper than the previous plan by Browne and Turner which required 9 viaducts down the Piopiotea. Probably the most remarkable feature is that, even today, there is no place to view the complete line. By all accounts, Holmes visualised the layout in his imagination.\n\nThe railway forms an ascending spiral southwards, with two relatively short tunnels, a circle and three hairpin bends. From the north, trains pass Raurimu before going round a 200\u00b0 bend to the left in a [[Horseshoe curve (transportation)|horseshoe curve]], climbing above the track on which they have just travelled. Two sharp bends to the right follow, after which the line passes through two short tunnels, the Lower Spiral Tunnel (384 m) and the Upper Spiral Tunnel (96 m). Trains then complete a full circle, crossing over the Lower Spiral Tunnel through which they have just passed which is {{convert|23|m|adj=on}} below, before continuing towards Wellington. {{convert|2|km|spell=In}} further on the line has two further sharp bends, to the right and then to the left.\n\nAfter the second of these bends a train has risen {{convert|132|m}} and travelled {{convert|6.8|km}} from Raurimu \u2013 the straight-line distance is {{convert|2|km}}. Some of the sharp curves are only 7\u00bd chains (150 m) radius. \n\nAlthough [[spiral (railway)|spirals]] are relatively common in the [[Alps]], particularly in [[Switzerland]], they generally involve extensive tunnelling inside mountainsides.

A direct line between these two points would rise {{convert|200|m}} in a distance of some {{convert|5|km}}, a [[gradient]] of 1 in 24. The area was thoroughly surveyed during the 1880s in an attempt to find a route with a lesser grade, but the only viable possibility seemed to require a {{convert|20|km|adj=on}} detour and nine massive viaducts. Even then, the gradient would have been over 1 in 50.\n\n== Construction ==\nThe problem was solved in 1898 by a since forgotten PWD surveyor in the employ of [[Robert Holmes (engineer)|Robert Holmes]], [[New Zealand Ministry of Works|Public Works Department]] engineer. He proposed a line that looped back upon itself and then spiralled around with the aid of tunnels and bridges, rising at a gradient of 1 in 52. Though costly and labour-intensive, the scheme was still cheaper than the previous plan by Browne and Turner which required 9 viaducts down the Piopiotea. Probably the most remarkable feature is that, even today, there is no place to view the complete line. By all accounts, Holmes visualised the layout in his imagination.\n\nThe railway forms an ascending spiral southwards, with two relatively short tunnels, a circle and three hairpin bends. From the north, trains pass Raurimu before going round a 200\u00b0 bend to the left in a [[Horseshoe curve (transportation)|horseshoe curve]], climbing above the track on which they have just travelled. Two sharp bends to the right follow, after which the line passes through two short tunnels, the Lower Spiral Tunnel (384 m) and the Upper Spiral Tunnel (96 m). Trains then complete a full circle, crossing over the Lower Spiral Tunnel through which they have just passed which is {{convert|23|m|adj=on}} below, before continuing towards Wellington. {{convert|2|km|spell=In}} further on the line has two further sharp bends, to the right and then to the left.\n\nAfter the second of these bends a train has risen {{convert|132|m}} and travelled {{convert|6.8|km}} from Raurimu \u2013 the straight-line distance is {{convert|2|km}}. Some of the sharp curves are only 7\u00bd chains (150 m) radius. \n\nAlthough [[spiral (railway)|spirals]] are relatively common in the [[Alps]], particularly in [[Switzerland]], they generally involve extensive tunnelling inside mountainsides. A masterly feature of Holmes' layout is the way in which it uses natural land contours to almost eliminate tunnels and viaducts.\n\nLegend has it that a train driver once emergency-braked his train in the night upon mistaking the light of his last wagon on a nearby part of the spiral as the rear of a different train directly ahead of him.<ref name=JOURNEYCOUNTS>{{cite news|title=Auckland to Wellington: It's the journey that counts|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/auckland-region/news/article.cfm?l_id=117&objectid=10734806|accessdate=28 June 2011|newspaper=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=28 June 2011|first=Danielle|last=Wright}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[North Island Main Trunk Railway]]\n* [[Spiral (railway)]]\n* [[Spiral tunnels and tunnels on a curved alignment]]\n* [[Tehachapi Loop]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n*''North Island Main Trunk: An Illustrated History'' by Bill Pierre (1981, Reed, Wellington) {{ISBN|0-589-01316-5}} (Chapters 12 & 13, pages 42\u201349)\n*''By Design: A brief history of the Public Works Department Ministry of Works 1870\u20131970'' by Rosslyn J.
