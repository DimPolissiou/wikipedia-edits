Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010.

Electrified from the 1890s, they have seen off challenges including proposals to replace them by [[trolleybuses]] and by a [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]] or [[U-Bahn]]. With a relatively static city network from the 1930s to the late 1970s, the city's trams have been expanding again since then. Recent expansions have taken the network into the suburbs beyond the city boundary, covering areas it retreated from in the first part of the 20th century. Further extensions have been approved, both to the city tram network itself, and by the introduction of a [[Limmattal light rail line|new light rail system]] in the [[Limmat Valley]] that will interwork with the city trams.\n\n==History==\n\n===Beginnings===\n[[File:R\u00f6sslitram.jpg|thumb|left|One of Z\u00fcrich's horse trams  in 1900]]\nVarious projects to introduce trams to Z\u00fcrich were proposed from the 1860s onwards. It was not until 1882, however, that the first tram operated in the city. These initial trams were operated by the {{ill|Z\u00fcrcher Strassenbahn Gesellschaft|de}} (ZStG), a private company, and were of [[standard gauge]] ({{RailGauge|sg|disp=or}} gauge) and horse-drawn.<ref name=vbzfafch>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | title = Facts & figures - Corporate history | publisher = VBZ | accessdate = 2012-05-26 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121007013822/http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/vbz/portrait/facts_figures/corporate_history.html | archivedate = 2012-10-07 }}</ref>\n\nBy 1888 the first electric tramway in Switzerland (the [[Vevey\u2013Montreux\u2013Chillon tramway]]) had opened, and, in 1894, another private company, the {{ill|Elektrische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich|de}} (EStZ), started operating [[metre gauge]] ({{RailGauge|1000mm|first=imp|disp=1}} gauge) electric trams in Z\u00fcrich. The EStZ only survived for two years before it was taken over by the City of Z\u00fcrich, who renamed it the [[St\u00e4dtische Strassenbahn Z\u00fcrich]] (StStZ). The following year, the horse trams of the ZStG were acquired.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFurther tramway companies were founded, some operating entirely within the city, some connecting the city with its nearer suburbs, and some running in rural areas entirely beyond the city, but still linked by connections with other lines to the city. Like the EStZ, all these lines were electrified and were built to the metre gauge. The StStZ gradually took over those companies that had significant city operations, usually closing any cross-boundary lines, whilst leaving those lines entirely beyond the city to their own devices.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Many companies===\n[[File:Zuercher Strassenbahnlinien um 1899.jpg|thumb|The mix of routes in 1899, distinguishing city owned (''Stadt'') and private (''Privat''), and horse (''Pferdebahn'') and electric (''elektrisch'')]]\nThe many companies that operated trams in and around Z\u00fcrich are summarised in the table below.

The standard gauge horse tram lines had all been converted to metre gauge and electrified. The StStZ had also built many tram extensions, resulting in a dense network of tramlines serving most city neighbourhoods.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nHowever, in 1927, the StStZ had introduced its first [[motor bus]] route, and this was to be followed in 1939 by the first of the [[Trolleybuses in Z\u00fcrich|city's trolleybus routes]]. Initially these modes complemented the trams, but at various times they have threatened to replace parts of the tram system, and sometimes succeeded in doing so.<ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1940, the StStZ started a modernisation of its trams, introducing the first prototypes of the {{ill|Swiss Standard Tram|de|Schweizer Standardwagen|fr|Tramway standard suisse}}. Despite Switzerland's neutrality, the economic effects of the [[second world war]] slowed down the program, but by 1953 the VBZ, as the StStZ had become in 1950, had taken delivery of 177 such trams.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Lines closed===\n[[File:Wetzikon Meilen Bahn Gr\u00fcningen.JPG|thumb|left|The WMB in Gr\u00fcningen, prior to 1950]]\nWhile the tram network within the city of Z\u00fcrich has seen relatively few line closures, the same cannot be said for the lines beyond the city. The StStZ routinely closed any out-of-city lines belonging to the companies it took over.<ref name=zacait/> In other cases, private sector operated lines succumbed without StStZ involvement. Out of town closures included:\n\n* The Schlieren to Dietikon and Schlieren to Weinigen lines of the LSB company, closed in 1928 and 1931 respectively.<ref name=tmblsb/> \n* The Oerlikon to Schwamendingen and Seebach to Glattbrugg lines of the ZOS company, closed in 1931.<ref name=tmbzos/> \n* The Uster to Langholz line of the UOeB company, closed in 1949.<ref name=ebuoeb/>\n* The Wetzikon to Meilen line of the WMB company, closed in 1950.<ref name=ebwmb/>\n\nIn the city, the initial threat to the tram came from its perceived inflexibility and susceptibility to the growing traffic congestion in the city streets. One proposed solution was the conversion of the less busy lines to trolleybus routes, and the first step in this direction was the conversion of tram route 1, from Burgwies to Hardplatz (1954-1956). This was followed by the Farbhof to Schlieren section of route 2 (1956-8) which became a westward extension of the same trolleybus route. In practice, the trolleybus service struggled to cope with peak loadings and punctuality did not improve. No further conversions of tram routes to trollrybuses have taken place.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n===Underground proposals===\n[[File:No. 7 Tram, Parade Platz.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of ''Mirage'' trams at Paradeplatz, operating on the surface where they were originally intended to be underground]]\nIn the 1950s, as well as proposing the conversion of less busy lines to trolleybus, plans were also made to place the busier lines in tunnel, in a form called the ''Tiefbahn''. The recently delivered Swiss Standard trams were not seen as suitable for this, because they had doors on their tapered car ends that would not have aligned with the proposed underground station platforms. In order to overcome this limitation, several new designs of tram were introduced. The first design, known as the P16 or ''Karpfen'', could not run on some existing routes, and only one batch of 15 motor tram and trailer pairs was built. A later design, which used articulation to avoid the problems of the P16, was eventually more successful and 126 vehicles were delivered by 1969. This car became popularly known as the ''Mirage''.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nDespite the planning and new rolling stock, a [[referendum]] in 1962 rejected the ''Tiefbahn''. However the proponents of going underground instead proposed a full scale [[metro (rapid transit)|metro]], the [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system. This would have been standard gauge and electrified using a third rail, and hence incompatible with the tram system. The lines would have extended further into the suburbs and provided faster transit times than the tramways, which would have been curtailed so as not to compete with the U-Bahn. However this would have been at the expense of a coarser grained network, with much longer distances between U-Bahn stations than between the tram stops they replaced.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nIn 1973, the U-Bahn proposal too was rejected in a referendum, but not before several stretches of U-Bahn tunnel had been built. One section of the putative U-Bahn has since been adapted, as described below, for use by trams, whilst another now forms the terminus of the [[Uetliberg railway line|Uetliberg]] and [[Sihltal railway line|Sihltal]] railway lines under the [[Z\u00fcrich Hauptbahnhof|Hauptbahnhof]].<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\n===Extensions and a new model===\n[[File:Zurich Be 4-6 Tram 2000 2075 Waldgarten.jpg|thumb|left|Tram 2000 tram at Waldgarten stop in the tunnel section built for the U-Bahn]]\nIn 1976, the first tram extension since 1954 took place, with the extension of route 4 from Hardturm to [[Werdh\u00f6lzli]]. Unlike the older lines, this extension was built mostly on reserved track, a precedent to be followed by most subsequent extensions.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nThe Werdh\u00f6lzli extension was followed in 1986 by the extension of routes 7 and 9 into new residential areas to the north-east of Z\u00fcrich. This used one of the stretches of tunnel that had been built for the rejected U-Bahn, between Milchbuck and Schwamendingen. The tram route was extended through the tunnel before splitting at Schwamendingen to serve the area beyond, using new surface track. Because the tunnels and stations had been built with [[island platform]]s, whilst Z\u00fcrich trams only have doors on their [[Right- and left-hand traffic#Terminology|nearside]], the section through the tunnel uses left-hand running.<ref name=zacait/>\n\nFrom 1976 onwards, the VBZ tram fleet was further updated, with the introduction of Z\u00fcrich's variant of the [[Tram 2000|Tram 2000 design]] used by several Swiss tram systems. Several sub-classes of the Tram 2000 were purchased, including articulated and non-articulated variants, and some without drivers cabs that could only operate in multiple with other cars. Eventually 171 of these vehicles were delivered, with the last of the class delivered in 1992.<ref name=zacait/><ref name=vbzfafch/>\n\nFrom the 1980s onwards, the system was increasingly acclaimed for its success in maintaining a high share of the [[modal split]], and the [[Z\u00fcrich model]] of transport provision was named after it. Beyond the tramway, the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn rail network]] was introduced to serve the region beyond the city boundaries, taking on some of the role that was originally planned for the U-Bahn. In 1990, the city's urban and regional transport were integrated by the introduction of the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund|ZVV]] and its zone-based common fare structure.<ref name=zacait/>\n{{clear left}}\n\n=== Low floors and the Glattalbahn ===\n[[File:Zurich Be 5-6 Cobra 3002 Letzistrasse.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Cobra (tram)|Bombardier Cobra]] low-floor tram on typical VBZ street track]]\nIn 2001, the VBZ took delivery of the first prototypes of a brand-new low-floor design of tram, known as the [[Cobra (tram)|Cobra]].<ref name=vbzfafch/> Despite many teething problems with the prototypes, which were eventually extensively rebuilt, there are now 88 of these trams in service, with the last delivered in 2010. In order to increase the number of low-floor trams in service, 23 trams from the otherwise high-floor Tram 2000 fleet were rebuilt between 2001 and 2005 with the addition of a low-floor centre section.\n\n[[File:Glatttalbahn - \u00d6rlikerhaus 2011-08-22 19-33-44.JPG|thumb|left|The Glattalbahn]]\nFrom the 1950s onwards, the [[Glattal]] region to the north of Z\u00fcrich experienced a rapid boom as population and industry spilled over from nearby Z\u00fcrich, partly driven by the presence of [[Z\u00fcrich Airport]]. Whilst the airport is served by the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn|city's S-Bahn rail network]], the economic growth and resulting congestion led to a need for a finer-grained form of public transport. The responsible transport authority (the [[Verkehrsbetriebe Glattal]] or VBG) responded by constructing a new light rail system, the [[Stadtbahn Glattal|Glattalbahn]]. This was built to be compatible with Z\u00fcrich's tram network, with which it connects at several points on the city boundary. The system opened in stages between 2006 and 2010. The VBG contracted the VBZ to operate the network, and several tram routes now operate across both networks.<ref name=gpw/><ref name=saw/><ref name=tuthhqlr>{{cite news | first = C.J. | last = Wansbeek | title = Glattal: High quality light rail to Z\u00fcrich airport | work = [[Tramways & Urban Transit]] | publisher = Ian Allan Ltd / Light Rail Transit Association | pages = 374\u2013376 | date = October 2003}}</ref>\n\nThe arrival of new trams between 2001 and 2010 led to the departure of older vehicles.

In the city centre the tram tracks run through largely pedestrianised streets, and in one place in the suburbs the trams use a tunnel originally constructed for the never completed [[Z\u00fcrich U-Bahn]] system.

Z\u00fcrich's trams are single-ended, with doors on only one side, although Forchbahn trains are double-ended and double-sided.

All tram stops are equipped with ticket machines, and passengers are required to purchase a ticket before boarding the vehicle.

Instead, tickets are randomly checked by roving teams of fare inspectors, and fines are imposed on passengers found without one.<ref name=vbzatm>{{cite web | url = http://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/content/vbz/en/index/tickets/fare_zone_system.html | title = VBZ - Automatic ticket machine | publisher = City of Z\u00fcrich | accessdate = 2012-05-21}}</ref>\n\nTram services are operated within the fare and ticketing system provided by the cantonal public transport authority, the [[Z\u00fcrcher Verkehrsverbund]] (ZVV). This system covers the whole of the [[canton of Z\u00fcrich]] and thus covers travel on other modes and services, provided by many other operators, and includes the [[Z\u00fcrich S-Bahn]] suburban rail network.

The Z\u00fcrich tram network extends over just two of these zones, with zone 110 covering the city routes, and zone 121 covering the Stadtbahn Glattal routes.

By 2010, it had conducted trials of three existing tram types on its network. These were the [[Stadler Tango]], the [[Siemens Combino]] and the [[Bombardier Flexity]]. It then requested tenders for the supply of 30 new trams, together with an option for the supply of a further 70 vehicles. The first trams were to be delivered in December 2016, and were to be 100% low floor with capacity for at least 225 passengers. In response, by April 2013 five suppliers had submitted bids.

Phillips suggests that Isha Upanishad was likely one of the earliest Upanishads, composed in the 1st half of 1st millennium BCE, after Brihadaranyaka and Chandogya, but before Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki, Kena, Katha, Manduka, Prasna, Svetasvatara and Maitri Upanishads, as well as before the earliest Buddhist Pali and Jaina canons.<ref name=stephenphillips/>\n\nEarlier 19th- and 20th-century scholars have similarly expressed a spectrum of views. Isha Upanishad has been chronologically listed by them as being among early Upanishads to being one among the middle Upanishads. [[Paul Deussen|Deussen]]<ref>Paul Deussen, [https://archive.org/stream/philosophyoftheupa00deusuoft#page/n39/mode/2up The Philosophy of the Upanishads], pages 22-26</ref> suggested, for example, that Isha was composed after ancient prose Upanishads \u2013 Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki and Kena; during a period when metrical poem-like Upanishads were being composed. Further, he suggests that ''Isha'' was composed before other prose Upanishads such as Prasna, Maitri, Mandukya and all post-Vedic era Upanishads.\n\nWinternitz,<ref>M Winternitz (2010), History of Indian Literature, Vol 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120802643}}</ref> suggests that Isha Upanishad was probably a pre-Buddha composition along with Katha, Svetasvatara, Mundaka and Prasna Upanishad, but after the first phase of ancient Upanishads that were composed in prose such as Brihadaranyaka, Chandogya, Taittiriya, Aitareya, Kaushitaki and Kena.

Wellcome L0027330.jpg|thumb|360px|A manuscript page from the Isha Upanisad.]]\nIsha Upanishad is the only Upanishad that is attached to a [[Samhita]], the most ancient layer of Vedic text known for their mantras and benedictions. Other Upanishads are attached to a later layer of Vedic texts such as [[Brahmanas]] and [[Aranyaka]]s.

These are called the Kanva (VSK) and Madhyandina (VSM) recensions. The order of verses 1\u20138 is the same in both, however, Kanva verses 9\u201314 correspond to Madhyandina verses 12, 13, 14, 9, 10, 11. Madhyandina verse 17 is a variation of Kanva 15, Kanva verse 16 is missing in Madhyandina, and Kanva verses 17\u201318 correspond to Madhyandina 15\u201316.\n\nIn both recensions, the Isha Upanishad is the 40th chapter of Shukla Yajur Veda. Versions with 18 verses refer to Kanva, while those with 17 verses are referring to the Madhyandina.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Kanva 40 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18\n|-\n| Madhyandina 40 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 9 || 10 || 11 || (17) || \u2013 || 15 || 16\n|-\n|}\n\n==Content==\n{{Hindu scriptures |expanded=Upanishads}}\n\n===Monism versus theism===\nThe Isha Upanishad is significant for its singular mention of the term \"[[Ishvara|Isha]]\" in the first hymn, a term it never repeats in other hymns. The concept \"Isha\" exhibits [[monism]] in one interpretation, or a form of [[monotheism in Hinduism|monotheism]] in an alternative interpretation, referred to as \"Self\" or \"Deity Lord\" respectively.\n\n{{Quote|\nEnveloped by the Lord must be This All \u2014 each thing that moves on earth.\nWith that renounced, enjoy thyself.

For example, the more recent scholar [[Mah\u012bdhara]] suggested that hymn 1 may be referring to Buddha, an interpretation that Max Muller stated was inadmissible because of the fundamental difference between Hinduism and Buddhism, with Hinduism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self exists\" and Buddhism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self does not exist\".<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>John C.

For liberation, know your Atman, which is motionless yet faster than mind, it is distant, it is near, it is within all, it is without all this. It is all pervading.

These are called the Kanva (VSK) and Madhyandina (VSM) recensions. The order of verses 1\u20138 is the same in both, however, Kanva verses 9\u201314 correspond to Madhyandina verses 12, 13, 14, 9, 10, 11. Madhyandina verse 17 is a variation of Kanva 15, Kanva verse 16 is missing in Madhyandina, and Kanva verses 17\u201318 correspond to Madhyandina 15\u201316.\n\nIn both recensions, the Isha Upanishad is the 40th chapter of Shukla Yajur Veda. Versions with 18 verses refer to Kanva, while those with 17 verses are referring to the Madhyandina.\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Kanva 40 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18\n|-\n| Madhyandina 40 || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 9 || 10 || 11 || (17) || \u2013 || 15 || 16\n|-\n|}\n\n==Content==\n{{Hindu scriptures |expanded=Upanishads}}\n\n===Monism versus theism===\nThe Isha Upanishad is significant for its singular mention of the term \"[[Ishvara|Isha]]\" in the first hymn, a term it never repeats in other hymns. The concept \"Isha\" exhibits [[monism]] in one interpretation, or a form of [[monotheism in Hinduism|monotheism]] in an alternative interpretation, referred to as \"Self\" or \"Deity Lord\" respectively.\n\n{{Quote|\nEnveloped by the Lord must be This All \u2014 each thing that moves on earth.\nWith that renounced, enjoy thyself.

For example, the more recent scholar [[Mah\u012bdhara]] suggested that hymn 1 may be referring to Buddha, an interpretation that Max Muller stated was inadmissible because of the fundamental difference between Hinduism and Buddhism, with Hinduism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self exists\" and Buddhism relying on the premise \"Soul, Self does not exist\".<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>John C.

As we have already observed, this is the basic and ineradicable distinction between Hinduism and Buddhism\".</ref>\n\n===Pursuit of Karma versus pursuit of Self===\nThe Isha Upanishad, in hymns 2\u20136, acknowledges the contrasting tension within Hinduism, between the empirical life of householder and action ([[karma]]) and the spiritual life of renunciation and knowledge ([[jnana]]).<ref name=ralphgriffith/>\n{{Quote|\nShould one wish to live a hundred years on this earth, he should live doing Karma. While thus, as man, you live, there is no way other than this by which Karma will not cling to you. Those who partake the nature of the ''Asuras'' [evil], are enveloped in blind darkness, and that is where they reside who ignore their Atman [Self]. For liberation, know your Atman, which is motionless yet faster than mind, it is distant, it is near, it is within all, it is without all this. It is all pervading. And he who beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all beings, he never turns away from it [the Self].\n|Isha Upanishad, Hymns 2-6<ref name=adishankaraisha/><ref name=maxmullertrans>Max Muller (Translator), [https://archive.org/stream/upanishads01ml#page/310/mode/2up Vajasaneyi Samhita Upanishad], Oxford University Press, pages 311-314</ref>}}\n\nAdi Shankara suggests that \"he\" in hymn 6 (last sentence in above quote) is the \"seeker of emancipation, on a journey to realize Self and Oneness in innermost self and everyone, and includes those in [[sannyasa]]\";<ref name=adishankaraisha/> while Madhvacharya suggests \"he\" is \"the individual soul in loving devotion of God, seeking to get infinitely close to the God soul\".<ref name=madhavabhasya/>\n\nMax Muller, in his review of commentaries by many ancient and medieval Indian scholars,<ref name=maxmullercomments/> states that these verses of Isha Upanishad are proclaiming the \"uselessness of all rituals, whether related to sacrifices or precepts of [[dharma]]\", but simultaneously acknowledging the \"harmlessness and necessity of social activity, that may be seen as potentially intermediate preparation to the path of Knowledge\". The Isha Upanishad, is reminding the reader that neither routine life and rituals are right nor are they wrong, states Max Muller.<ref name=maxmullercomments/> They may be necessary to many, nevertheless, to prepare a person for emancipation, to show the path where cravings feel meaningless, and to produce a serene mind that longs for meaning and one that can discern highest knowledge.<ref name=maxmullercomments/> Ralph Griffith suggests the verses 2-6 of Isha Upanishad are condemning those who perform ''Karma'' in order to \"get future advantages in life or to gain a place in heaven\", because that is ignorance. The avoidance of \"soul knowledge and its eternal, all-pervasive nature\" is akin to \"killing one's soul\" and living a dead life opines Isha Upanishad, states Griffith.<ref name=ralphgriffith/> The pursuit of Self is the seeking of the eternal, the whole, the all-transcending, the self-depending, the Oneness and law of all nature and existence.<ref>Astrid Fitzgerald (2002), Being Consciousness Bliss: A Seeker's Guide, Steiner, {{ISBN|978-0970109781}}, page 52</ref>\n\n===Vidya versus Avidya===\nThe Isha Upanishad suggests that one root of sorrow and suffering is considering one's Self as distinct and conflicted with the Self of others, assuming that the nature of existence is a conflicted duality where one's happiness and suffering is viewed as different from another living being's happiness and suffering. Such sorrow and suffering cannot exist, suggests the Upanishad, if an individual realizes that the Self is in all things, understands the Oneness in all of existence, focuses beyond individual egos and in the pursuit of Universal values, the Self and Real Knowledge.<ref name=charlesjohnstoncomments/>\n{{Quote|\nWhen to a man who understands,<br>\nthe Self has become all things,<br>\nwhat sorrow, what trouble can there be,<br>\nto him who beholds that unity.\n|Isha Upanishad, Hymn 7<ref name=maxmullertrans/>}}\n\nThe Isha Upanishad, in hymn 8 through 11, praises the study of ''Vidya'' (Real Knowledge, eternal truths) and ''Avidya'' (not Real Knowledge, empirical truths).<ref name=maxmullercomments/><ref>Richard H.

Alternatively, it is suggested this term was here intended to be treated as an [[Agglutination|agglutinate]]<nowiki/>d improper noun, and thus translated as ''rightful king'' rather than left as a proper name ''Melchizedek''; this interpretation is taken by some modern translations, such as the New [[JPS Tanakh]].\n\n==In Judaism==\n{{See also| Righteous Priest}}\n<!---------PLEASE DO NOT DEPART FROM ENGLISH WIKIPEDIA SPELLING CONVENTIONS- PLEASE DO NOT USE REFS FOR PLACING COMMENTS-->\nThe [[Torah Laws|Law of Moses]] stipulates that only the male descendants of [[Aaron]] be commissioned to serve as [[Kohen|Jewish priests]] before [[Yahweh|the God of Israel]] and the Jewish nation. This commission is believed in Judaism to be \"a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] of everlasting priesthood\" (\"[[Brith HaKehuna]]\") and not eligible for replacement by other [[tribes of Israel]].\n\nJudaic [[midrash]] (exegesis) identifies Melchizedek with [[Shem]] the son of [[Noah]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13541-shem|title=SHEM - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> Although the [[Book of Genesis]] affirms that Melchizedek was \"priest of God Most High\" (Genesis 14:18), the [[Midrash]] and [[Babylonian Talmud]] maintain that the priesthood held by [[Melchizedek]], who pre-dated the patriarch Levi by five generations (Melchizedek pre-dates Aaron by six generations; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehoth, Amram, Aaron), was given in his stead to Abraham who, in turn, passed it on to his patrilineal descendants, Isaac and then to Jacob. Midrashic literature attributes this transition as a consequence due to Melchizedek preceding the name of [[Abraham]] to that of God, such as in the [[Midrash Rabbah]] to Genesis,<ref>Tractate Nedarim</ref> while some Jewish commentators, such as [[Chaim ibn Attar]], write that Melchizedek gave the priesthood to Abraham willingly.\n\n[[Maimonides]], in his Mishna Torah compilation, explains that [[Jacob]] separated his son [[Levi]] from his other sons and appointed him to instruct and teach the ways of \"service to God\", specifically the servicial methods used by his forefather [[Abraham]], to his brothers. He also instructed his sons to perpetuate this status of Levi (\"Shevet Levi\") for eternity (Maimonides, Avodah Zorah 1:15). For the prelude of this choice see [[Targum Yonathan]] to Genesis 32:25, and/or [[Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer]] ch. 37. In midrash, it is written that [[Amram]] the son of [[Kohath]] the son of Levi was the spiritual leader of the sons of Jacob (\"Israel\") during their Egyptian Bondage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Following his passing, his post was assumed by his son Aaron.\n\nAt the time of the erection of the [[Tabernacle]], God commanded Moses to appoint Aaron and his sons to the Jewish priestly service as a precondition to God revealing his [[Shechinah]] amongst the nation of Israel;\n\n{{quote|And Aaron and his sons I will sanctify to serve me and I will dwell amidst the sons of Israel and I will be to them a God, and they will know that I (am) God their Master that took them out from the land of Egypt (in order that) I (will) dwell in their midst|Exodus 29:44-46}}\n\nThe majority of [[Chazal]]ic literature attributes the primary character of psalm 110 as [[King David]]<ref>based on the text \u05e9\u05d1 \u05dc'''\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9''' with \"Yemini\" referring either to [[King Saul]] of the [[tribe of Benjamin]] (Bin'''yamin''') whom David was careful not to overthrow ''or'' to the [[Torah]] (as per it being referred to as \"from his right hand -a fire of religion to them\" -Deuteronomy) -Targum Yonathan to Psalm 110</ref> who was a \"righteous king\" (\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7) of Salem (Jerusalem) and, like Melchizedek, had certain priest-like responsibilities, while the [[Babylonian Talmud]] understands the chapter as referring to Abram who was victorious in battling to save his nephew Lot and merited priesthood.<ref>Babylonian Talmud to Nedarim, p. 32</ref>  The Zohar defines the noted Melchizedek as referring to [[Ahron]] the [[Kohen Gadol]] (high priest).<ref>zohar vol. 3 p.53b</ref>\n\n==In Christianity==\n[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]] is the [[Messiah]] spoken of as \"a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek\" ({{Bibleverse||Ps.|110:4|HE}}), and so Jesus plays the role of the king-priest once and for all. According to the writer of [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] (7:13-17) Jesus is considered a priest in the order of Melchizedek because, like Melchizedek, Jesus was not a [[Kohen|descendant of Aaron]], and thus would not qualify for the Jewish priesthood under the [[Law of Moses]].\n\nMelchizedek is referred to again in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 5:6-10; Hebrews 6:20; Hebrews 7:1-21: \"Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek\"; and Hebrews 8:1.\n\n<blockquote>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises\" (Hebrews 7:5-6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchizedek, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law\" (Hebrews 7:11-12).</blockquote>\n\nThe author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] in the [[New Testament]] discussed this subject considerably, listing the following reasons for why the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the Aaronic priesthood:\n\n#Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek; later, the Levites would receive tithes from their countrymen. Since Aaron was in Abraham's loins then, it was as if the Aaronic priesthood were paying tithes to Melchizedek. (Heb. 7:4-10)\n#The one who blesses is always greater than the one being blessed. Thus, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham.  As Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham, it follows that Melchizedek is greater than Levi. (Heb. 7:7-10)\n#If the priesthood of Aaron were effective, God would not have called a new priest in a different order in Psalm 110. (Heb. 7:11)\n#The basis of the Aaronic priesthood was ancestry; the basis of the priesthood of Melchizedek is everlasting life. That is, there is no interruption due to a priest's death. (Heb. 7:8,15-16,23-25)\n#Christ, being sinless, does not need a sacrifice for his own sins. (Heb. 7:26-27)\n#The priesthood of Melchizedek is more effective because it required a single sacrifice once and for all (Jesus), while the Levitical priesthood made endless sacrifices. (Heb. 7:27)\n#The [[kohen|Aaronic priests]] serve (or, rather, served) in an earthly copy and shadow of the heavenly Temple, which Jesus serves in. (Heb. 8:5)\n\nThe epistle goes on to say that the [[New Covenant (theology)|covenant]] of Jesus is superior to the [[Mosaic Covenant|covenant]] the Levitical priesthood is under. Some Christians hold that Melchizedek was a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ, and some other Christians hold that Melchizedek indeed ''was'' Christ. Reasons provided include that Melchizedek's name means \"king of righteousness\" according to the author of Hebrews, and that being king of Salem makes Melchizedek the \"king of peace\". Heb. 7:3 states, \"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he (Melchizedek) remains a priest forever.\" Melchizedek gave Abraham bread and wine, which some Christians consider symbols of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice to confirm a covenant.\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[Catholicism|Catholics]] find the roots of their priesthood in the tradition of Melchizedek (CCC 1544).<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722004028/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM |date=July 22, 2016 }} \"The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, \"priest of God Most High,\" as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the unique \"high priest after the order of Melchizedek\";16 \"holy, blameless, unstained,\"</ref> In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18, Melchizedek offers a sacrifice of bread and wine. Christ therefore fulfilled the prophecy of Ps 110:4, that he would be a priest \"after the order of Melchizedek\" at the [[Last Supper]], when he broke and shared bread with his [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]]. Catholics interpret  more literally Christ's commands that the Apostles should \"do this in memory of Me\" and \"as often as you can\". As such, the Catholic Church, at least once a day in every parish, offers the same sacrifice of bread and wine at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], as part of the [[Sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]].\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}} \n{{Further|Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}\n\nIn the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the Melchizedek Priesthood is viewed as the priesthood authority of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]], as well as [[Old Testament]] prophets, higher than that of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic]] authority of [[John the Baptist]] and of the Levites.\n\nAccording to the [[Book of Mormon]], the prophet [[Melchizedek]] preached repentance to the people of a wicked city, and established peace in the land. According to {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=13|verse=18}}, Melchizedek's efforts earned him the title \"the prince of peace\". Of particular importance is the parallel Hebrew meaning of \"prince of peace\" and \"king of Salem\", another of Melchizedek's titles, and his association with (or typology of) Jesus Christ, who is also called the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:2), as well as the Great High Priest (Heb. 4:14). Later, Melchizedek's people were, according to [[Joseph Smith]], caught up, or \"[[Translation (LDS Church)|translated]]\", to meet the city of Enoch ([[Joseph Smith Translation]] of Genesis 14:34).

This commission is believed in Judaism to be \"a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] of everlasting priesthood\" (\"[[Brith HaKehuna]]\") and not eligible for replacement by other [[tribes of Israel]].\n\nJudaic [[midrash]] (exegesis) identifies Melchizedek with [[Shem]] the son of [[Noah]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13541-shem|title=SHEM - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> Although the [[Book of Genesis]] affirms that Melchizedek was \"priest of God Most High\" (Genesis 14:18), the [[Midrash]] and [[Babylonian Talmud]] maintain that the priesthood held by [[Melchizedek]], who pre-dated the patriarch Levi by five generations (Melchizedek pre-dates Aaron by six generations; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Levi, Kehoth, Amram, Aaron), was given in his stead to Abraham who, in turn, passed it on to his patrilineal descendants, Isaac and then to Jacob. Midrashic literature attributes this transition as a consequence due to Melchizedek preceding the name of [[Abraham]] to that of God, such as in the [[Midrash Rabbah]] to Genesis,<ref>Tractate Nedarim</ref> while some Jewish commentators, such as [[Chaim ibn Attar]], write that Melchizedek gave the priesthood to Abraham willingly.\n\n[[Maimonides]], in his Mishna Torah compilation, explains that [[Jacob]] separated his son [[Levi]] from his other sons and appointed him to instruct and teach the ways of \"service to God\", specifically the servicial methods used by his forefather [[Abraham]], to his brothers. He also instructed his sons to perpetuate this status of Levi (\"Shevet Levi\") for eternity (Maimonides, Avodah Zorah 1:15). For the prelude of this choice see [[Targum Yonathan]] to Genesis 32:25, and/or [[Pirkei de-Rabbi Eliezer]] ch. 37. In midrash, it is written that [[Amram]] the son of [[Kohath]] the son of Levi was the spiritual leader of the sons of Jacob (\"Israel\") during their Egyptian Bondage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Following his passing, his post was assumed by his son Aaron.\n\nAt the time of the erection of the [[Tabernacle]], God commanded Moses to appoint Aaron and his sons to the Jewish priestly service as a precondition to God revealing his [[Shechinah]] amongst the nation of Israel;\n\n{{quote|And Aaron and his sons I will sanctify to serve me and I will dwell amidst the sons of Israel and I will be to them a God, and they will know that I (am) God their Master that took them out from the land of Egypt (in order that) I (will) dwell in their midst|Exodus 29:44-46}}\n\nThe majority of [[Chazal]]ic literature attributes the primary character of psalm 110 as [[King David]]<ref>based on the text \u05e9\u05d1 \u05dc'''\u05d9\u05de\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9''' with \"Yemini\" referring either to [[King Saul]] of the [[tribe of Benjamin]] (Bin'''yamin''') whom David was careful not to overthrow ''or'' to the [[Torah]] (as per it being referred to as \"from his right hand -a fire of religion to them\" -Deuteronomy) -Targum Yonathan to Psalm 110</ref> who was a \"righteous king\" (\u05de\u05dc\u05db\u05d9 \u05e6\u05d3\u05e7) of Salem (Jerusalem) and, like Melchizedek, had certain priest-like responsibilities, while the [[Babylonian Talmud]] understands the chapter as referring to Abram who was victorious in battling to save his nephew Lot and merited priesthood.<ref>Babylonian Talmud to Nedarim, p. 32</ref>  The Zohar defines the noted Melchizedek as referring to [[Ahron]] the [[Kohen Gadol]] (high priest).<ref>zohar vol. 3 p.53b</ref>\n\n==In Christianity==\n[[Christianity|Christians]] believe that [[Jesus of Nazareth|Jesus]] is the [[Messiah]] spoken of as \"a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek\" ({{Bibleverse||Ps.|110:4|HE}}), and so Jesus plays the role of the king-priest once and for all. According to the writer of [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] (7:13-17) Jesus is considered a priest in the order of Melchizedek because, like Melchizedek, Jesus was not a [[Kohen|descendant of Aaron]], and thus would not qualify for the Jewish priesthood under the [[Law of Moses]].\n\nMelchizedek is referred to again in [[Epistle to the Hebrews|Hebrews]] 5:6-10; Hebrews 6:20; Hebrews 7:1-21: \"Thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek\"; and Hebrews 8:1.\n\n<blockquote>And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham: But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises\" (Hebrews 7:5-6).</blockquote>\n<blockquote>If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for under it the people received the law,) what further need was there that another priest should rise after the order of Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron? For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a change also of the law\" (Hebrews 7:11-12).</blockquote>\n\nThe author of the [[Epistle to the Hebrews]] in the [[New Testament]] discussed this subject considerably, listing the following reasons for why the priesthood of Melchizedek is superior to the Aaronic priesthood:\n\n#Abraham paid tithes to Melchizedek; later, the Levites would receive tithes from their countrymen. Since Aaron was in Abraham's loins then, it was as if the Aaronic priesthood were paying tithes to Melchizedek. (Heb. 7:4-10)\n#The one who blesses is always greater than the one being blessed. Thus, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham.  As Levi was yet in the loins of Abraham, it follows that Melchizedek is greater than Levi. (Heb. 7:7-10)\n#If the priesthood of Aaron were effective, God would not have called a new priest in a different order in Psalm 110. (Heb. 7:11)\n#The basis of the Aaronic priesthood was ancestry; the basis of the priesthood of Melchizedek is everlasting life. That is, there is no interruption due to a priest's death. (Heb. 7:8,15-16,23-25)\n#Christ, being sinless, does not need a sacrifice for his own sins. (Heb. 7:26-27)\n#The priesthood of Melchizedek is more effective because it required a single sacrifice once and for all (Jesus), while the Levitical priesthood made endless sacrifices. (Heb. 7:27)\n#The [[kohen|Aaronic priests]] serve (or, rather, served) in an earthly copy and shadow of the heavenly Temple, which Jesus serves in. (Heb. 8:5)\n\nThe epistle goes on to say that the [[New Covenant (theology)|covenant]] of Jesus is superior to the [[Mosaic Covenant|covenant]] the Levitical priesthood is under. Some Christians hold that Melchizedek was a [[Typology (theology)|type]] of Christ, and some other Christians hold that Melchizedek indeed ''was'' Christ. Reasons provided include that Melchizedek's name means \"king of righteousness\" according to the author of Hebrews, and that being king of Salem makes Melchizedek the \"king of peace.\" Heb. 7:3 states, \"Without father or mother, without genealogy, without beginning of days or end of life, like the Son of God he (Melchizedek) remains a priest forever.\" Melchizedek gave Abraham bread and wine, which some Christians consider symbols of the body and blood of Jesus Christ, the sacrifice to confirm a covenant.\n\n===Catholicism===\n[[Catholicism|Catholics]] find the roots of their priesthood in the tradition of Melchizedek. (CCC 1544)<ref>[https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM Catechism of the Catholic Church] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160722004028/https://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0015/__P4T.HTM |date=July 22, 2016 }} \"The Christian tradition considers Melchizedek, \"priest of God Most High,\" as a prefiguration of the priesthood of Christ, the unique \"high priest after the order of Melchizedek\";16 \"holy, blameless, unstained,\"</ref> In [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 14:18, Melchizedek offers a sacrifice of bread and wine. Christ therefore fulfilled the prophecy of Ps 110:4, that he would be a priest \"after the order of Melchizedek,\" at the [[Last Supper]], when he broke and shared bread with his [[Twelve Apostles|disciples]]. Catholics interpret  more literally Christ's commands that the Apostles should \"do this in memory of Me\" and \"as often as you can\". As such, the Catholic Church, at least once a day in every parish, offers the same sacrifice of bread and wine at [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]], as part of the [[Sacrament]] of the [[Eucharist]].\n\n===Latter Day Saint movement===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2017}} \n{{Further|Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)}}\n\nIn the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], the Melchizedek Priesthood is viewed as the priesthood authority of the [[Twelve Apostles]] of [[Jesus]], as well as [[Old Testament]] prophets, higher than that of the [[Aaronic priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Aaronic]] authority of [[John the Baptist]] and of the Levites.\n\nAccording to the [[Book of Mormon]], the prophet [[Melchizedek]] preached repentance to the people of a wicked city, and established peace in the land. According to {{sourcetext|source=Book of Mormon|book=Alma|chapter=13|verse=18}}, Melchizedek's efforts earned him the title \"the prince of peace\". Of particular importance is the parallel Hebrew meaning of \"prince of peace\" and \"king of Salem\", another of Melchizedek's titles, and his association with (or typology of) Jesus Christ, who is also called the Prince of Peace (Isa. 9:2), as well as the Great High Priest (Heb. 4:14). Later, Melchizedek's people were, according to [[Joseph Smith]], caught up, or \"[[Translation (LDS Church)|translated]]\", to meet the city of Enoch ([[Joseph Smith Translation]] of Genesis 14:34). The priesthood is referred to by the name of Melchizedek because he was such a great high priest (Doctrine & Covenants {{sourcetext|source=The Doctrine and Covenants|book=Section 107|verse=2}}).

Half of the tales feature his 'Berry' characters.\n\n== Plot==\n\nThe book includes two main groups of short stories, the first consisting of pre-[[World War I|war]] frivolities and the second post-war. The final story in the first group recounts the sudden end of the pre-war male characters, now serving in the Great War, who hear a sudden sound which some interpret as a ship's siren and others as the sound of a heavy gun. A moment later, all are killed in the crater of a great shell. The stories of the second group return to the entirely different 'Berry' set of characters from ''[[The Brother of Daphne]]'', with the introduction of Ad\u00e8le Feste, an American.\n\n== Background ==\nThe stories included in Book I consist largely of tales set before [[World War I|the Great War]] and published monthly in [[The Windsor Magazine|''The Windsor Magazine'']] in 1915, with the final story (which concludes during the War on the [[Macedonian front]], where Mercer himself served) being published in June 1919.{{sfn|Smithers|1982|pp=82, 93}} The first story has the characters in London, after which they proceed to the island of Rih (a thinly-disguised [[Madeira]]). \n\nThe story included in the Interlude features a unique set of characters, initially in Scotland on the day that the Great War began and subsequently on the Western Front. \n\nThe stories in Book II featuring Berry & Co can be divided into three groups. The first two continue the style of those collected in \"The Brother of Daphne\" and were serialised in the Windsor in the summer of 1914 immediately following on from the last of those stories. The second group consists of three stories when Berry & Co meet up in Egypt (where Mercer also served) at the end of the War and then travel home via Rome. The final story, \"Nemesis\", was originally intended for [[Punch (magazine)|Punch]] and is therefore shorter than the normal Windsor stories. In the Windsor the protagonist is named Jeremy, but for its inclusion in the book the name was changed to Berry. \n\nAfter being released from war service, Mercer decided not to return to his pre-war work at [[Bar (law)|the bar]], but to concentrate on writing.{{sfn|Usborne|1974|pp=93}}\n\n== Chapters ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\nBook I - How Some Passed Out Of The Courts For Ever\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | I\n| What's In A Name ?\n| December 1914\n| XLI\n| 240\n| 149-158\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | II\n| A Sister Ship\n| January 1915\n| XLI\n| 241\n| 250-258\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | III\n| To Seat Four\n| February 1915\n| XLI\n| 242\n| 389-398\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | IV\n| Love Thirty\n| March 1915\n| XLI\n| 243\n| 510-518\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| For Better Or For Worse\n| June 1919\n| L\n| 294\n| 17-26\n| Norah Schlegel\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\nInterlude\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n| And The Other Left\n| November 1914\n| XL\n| 239\n| 661-671\n| Charles J Crombie\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\nBook II - How Others Left The Courts Only To Return \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | I\n| A B\u00e9b\u00e9 In Arms\n| August 1914\n| XL\n| 236\n| 321-327\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | II\n| Contempt Of Court\n| September 1914\n| XL\n| 237\n| 429-436\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | III\n| Beauty Repeats Itself\n| July 1919\n| L\n| 295\n| 97-107\n| Norah Schlegel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | IV\n| The Desert Air\n| August 1919\n| L\n| 296\n| 181-192\n| Norah Schlegel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| As Rome Does\n| September 1919\n| L\n| 297\n| 275-284\n| Norah Schlegel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | VI\n| Nemesis\n| November 1919\n| L\n| 299\n| 483-486\n| Howard K Elcock\n|}\n\n== Illustrations ==\n\nThe illustrations from the Windsor stories were not included in the book version, although one of Norah Schlegel's illustrations from \"For Better Or For Worse\" was used to illustrate the dustjacket of the first edition.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe review in September's [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] was much less enthusiastic than that for the author's first collection, ''[[The Brother of Daphne]]'':{{sfn|Smithers|1982|p=95}} \"The main object of the characters in ''The Courts of Idleness'' ([[Ward Lock & Co|Ward, Lock]]) was to amuse themselves, and as their sprightly conversations were often punctuated by laughter I take it that they succeeded.

In the Windsor the protagonist is named Jeremy, but for its inclusion in the book the name was changed to Berry. \n\nAfter being released from war service, Mercer decided not to return to his pre-war work at [[Bar (law)|the bar]], but to concentrate on writing.{{sfn|Usborne|1974|pp=93}}\n\n== Chapters ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\nBook I - How Some Passed Out Of The Courts For Ever\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | I\n| What's In A Name ?\n| December 1914\n| XLI\n| 240\n| 149-158\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | II\n| A Sister Ship\n| January 1915\n| XLI\n| 241\n| 250-258\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | III\n| To Seat Four\n| February 1915\n| XLI\n| 242\n| 389-398\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | IV\n| Love Thirty\n| March 1915\n| XLI\n| 243\n| 510-518\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| For Better Or For Worse\n| June 1919\n| L\n| 294\n| 17-26\n| Norah Schlegel\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\nInterlude\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | \n| And The Other Left\n| November 1914\n| XL\n| 239\n| 661-671\n| Charles J Crombie\n|}\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders sortable\" style=\"margin-right: 0;\"\n|+\nBook II - How Others Left The Courts Only To Return \n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Chapter\n! scope=\"col\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" | Windsor Date\n! scope=\"col\" | Volume\n! scope=\"col\" | Issue\n! scope=\"col\" | Pages\n! scope=\"col\" | Illustrator\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | I\n| A B\u00e9b\u00e9 In Arms\n| August 1914\n| XL\n| 236\n| 321-327\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | II\n| Contempt Of Court\n| September 1914\n| XL\n| 237\n| 429-436\n| G C Wilmhurst\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | III\n| Beauty Repeats Itself\n| July 1919\n| L\n| 295\n| 97-107\n| Norah Schlegel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | IV\n| The Desert Air\n| August 1919\n| L\n| 296\n| 181-192\n| Norah Schlegel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | V\n| As Rome Does\n| September 1919\n| L\n| 297\n| 275-284\n| Norah Schlegel\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | VI\n| Nemesis\n| November 1919\n| L\n| 299\n| 483-486\n| Howard K Elcock\n|}\n\n== Illustrations ==\n\nThe illustrations from the Windsor stories were not included in the book version, although one of Norah Schlegel's illustrations from \"For Better Or For Worse\" was used to illustrate the dustjacket of the first edition.\n\n== Critical reception ==\nThe review in September's [[Punch (magazine)|''Punch'']] was much less enthusiastic than that for the author's first collection, ''[[The Brother of Daphne]]'':{{sfn|Smithers|1982|p=95}} \"The main object of the characters in ''The Courts of Idleness'' ([[Ward Lock & Co|Ward, Lock]]) was to amuse themselves, and as their sprightly conversations were often punctuated by laughter I take it that they succeeded.
