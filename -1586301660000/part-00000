It was released for the [[IBM PC]], [[Amiga]], [[Macintosh]], and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]]. The Super NES version adds eight [[scenario]]s, where the goal in each is to eliminate the enemy [[red ant]]s in various locales, each with different hazards.\n\nIn ''SimAnt'', the player plays the role of an [[ant]] in a colony of [[Black garden ant|black ant]]s in the back yard of a [[suburb|suburban home]]. The ant colony must battle against enemy [[Red imported fire ant|red ants]]. The ultimate goal is to spread throughout the garden, into the house, and finally to drive out the red ants and [[human]] owners. In this respect, ''SimAnt'' differed from other 'Sim' games that were open-ended and had no victory conditions.\n\nIn the Quick Game, the player establishes a black ant colony in a small patch of yard, shown in [[top-down perspective]]. The computer opponent establishes a competing red ant colony in the same patch. Underground ant colonies are depicted in a side view. The player has direct control of a single ant at a time, indicated by a yellow color, and may switch control to a different ant at any time by either double-clicking the desired ant or choosing Exchange from the Yellow Ant menu and clicking on it. The player's yellow ant may influence the behavior of other black ants by leaving [[pheromone]] trails to destinations such as food and enemy ant colonies and can control the other ants in a limited way (by ordering a certain number to follow it, for instance). The quick game is won or lost when either the red or black colony in said patch is defeated.\n\nThe player's yellow ant may pick up food and pebbles, engage in [[trophallaxis]] (by receiving [[Regurgitation (digestion)|regurgitated]] food from friendly ants), and attack enemy ants. Groups of ants (or yellow ant with her recruits) may attack and kill bigger enemies like [[spider]]s, [[caterpillar]]s, and [[antlion]]s. Natural hazards include human footsteps, electrical outlets, bugspray, spiders, [[antlion]]s, [[lawnmower]]s, and [[rain]], which washes away pheromone trails and can flood the bottom of ant nests.\n\nIn the Full Game, the player begins with an ant colony in an overhead view, much like the Quick Game. The region of this overhead view is a single square of a map containing a yard and house. The player spreads to other areas by producing young queens and drones to mate with each other.  The full game is lost when the black colonies are eliminated and won when the red colonies are eliminated and the humans are driven out of the house.\n\nThe Experimental Game is similar to the Quick Game, except the player can also control red ants and spiders and has access to a set of experimental tools. These tools allow the player to place pheromone trails, maze walls, rocks, ants, pesticides and food.\n\nThe boxed game also comes with a thoroughly researched instruction manual, which not only covers game mechanics, but also contains a large amount of information regarding ants and ant societies (some of which is likely outdated by modern standards, considering the research done since the early 1990s).\n\n==Reception==\nAccording to the game box, using a statistic from the Software Publisher's Association, more than 100,000 copies of the PC version had sold by April 10, 1992.\n\nThe game was reviewed in 1992 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #178 by Patricia Hartley and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column.

Constant overexpression of GI from the ''Cauliflower mosaic virus'' 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mizoguchi|first=Tsuyoshi|date=August 2005|title=Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in ''Arabidopsis''|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2255\u20132270|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.033464|pmid=16006578|pmc=1182487}}</ref>\n\nAction potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants.

Constant overexpression of GI from the ''Cauliflower mosaic virus'' 35S promoter causes early flowering under short day so an increase in GI mRNA expression induces flowering. Also, GI increases the expression of FT and CO mRNA, and FT and CO mutants showed later flowering time than GI mutant. In other words, functional FT and CO genes are required for flowering under short day. In addition, these flowering genes accumulate during light phase and decline during dark phase, which are measured by green fluorescent protein. Thus, their expressions oscillate during the 24-hour light-dark-cycle. In conclusion, the accumulation of GI mRNA alone or GI, FT, and CO mRNA promote flowering in ''Arabidopsis thaliana'' and these genes expressed in the temporal sequence GI-CO-FT.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Mizoguchi|first=Tsuyoshi|date=August 2005|title=Distinct Roles of GIGANTEA in Promoting Flowering and Regulating Circadian Rhythms in ''Arabidopsis''|journal=The Plant Cell|volume=17|issue=8|pages=2255\u20132270|doi=10.1105/tpc.105.033464|pmid=16006578|pmc=1182487}}</ref>\n\nAction potential triggers calcium flux into neurons in animal or root apex cells in plants.

The company was founded in 1958 with a store in [[Southbridge, Massachusetts]], and at its peak operated 700 stores in 20 states, including the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]], [[Upland South|Upper South]], [[Midwest United States|Midwest]], and the [[District of Columbia]], making it the fourth largest discount retailer in the United States.\n\nDespite some success in its later years, Ames was plagued by debt and a slow decline in sales. This resulted in two bankruptcy filings that ultimately put an end to the chain. The company, despite expanding into other markets and taking over many closed stores that had been abandoned by competitors, went out of business in 2002.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ames-lowville-ny.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A vacant Ames in [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville, New York]]. The \"shingle\" decor on the outside was typical of Ames stores built in the late 1970s.]]\n\nAmes began in 1958 when two Connecticut brothers, Milton and Irving Gilman, and Philip Feltman,<ref>\"Former Chief Executive of Ames store chain dies\".  [[Hartford Courant]], July 14, 1990.</ref> opened their first store in the Ames Worsted Textile Co. mill in Southbridge. The Gilmans and Feltman simply used the old sign of the textile mill for the new business. In 1971, this store was replaced with a modern store in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]]. A second store was opened in October, 1959 in [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont]].<ref name=TownCountryNews>{{cite news|title=AMES DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE t Grand Opening Thursday Sept. 14|publisher=Town & Country News and Pulaski Democrat|date=September 13, 1978}}</ref>\n\nAmes' original business strategy brought discounting to the smaller towns and rural areas of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. The company's success in serving a largely [[rural]] customer base in smaller, less-competitive markets resulted in consistently strong financial performance and steady growth combining acquisitions and an aggressive store-building program through the late 1980s.\n\nMany of the first stores were converted industrial sites, such as the first store in a former textile mill. Ames exploited the availability of cheap real estate in this manner in the first decades of the company, later moving to custom-built store facilities that provided standardized planning and marketing. Many Ames stores from the 1980s were the department store 'anchor store' for many discount mall developments.\n\nAmes' stock was added to the [[NYSE American|American Stock Exchange]] in May, 1967. The company later started trading on the [[NYSE]] in November, 1972.<ref name=TownCountryNews/>\n\n===Wave of expansion and first bankruptcy===\n[[File:Ames-seabrook-05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The former [[Seabrook, New Hampshire]] Ames with the store's old red logo]]\n\nAmes acquired the 32-store \"Big N\" chain from [[Neisner Brothers]] in November 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ames Department Stores, Inc. History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/ames-department-stores-inc-history/|website=Funding Universe}}</ref> In 1984 Ames acquired the [[King's Department Stores]] chain and added most of its 193 stores to the fold. In 1985 Ames acquired [[G.C. Murphy]] of [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania]], a chain that operated both discount stores and [[variety stores]] (the variety stores and many of the smaller G.C. Murphy discount stores would eventually be sold by Ames to [[McCrory Stores]] in 1989). Three years after the acquisition of G.C. Murphy, Ames expanded further, acquiring the 392-store [[Zayre]] chain in 1988. Saddled with increased debt and hampered by the additional cost of converting those stores to Ames stores, the company suffered a significant reduction in profitability in late 1989 and early 1990. The Zayre chain also operated with stores concentrated in two distinct regions, the Northeast and Florida, which made coordination difficult.\n[[File:Ames Stores Logo Red.svg|thumb|left|Older Ames logo which used a red color scheme.]]\nIn April 1990, Ames filed for [[bankruptcy protection]] under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. One of the causes of the bankruptcy appeared to be Ames' policy of extending [[credit (finance)#consumer credit|consumer credit]] to almost anyone who asked, without first checking their [[credit rating]], in an attempt to increase Ames' [[market share]]. Ames had also replaced the Zayre credit card program with [[Visa, Inc.|Visa]] cards that could be used anywhere Visa was accepted. This often resulted in Ames giving [[credit cards]] to customers who were already in [[debt]], and they tended to attract high risk borrowers who tended to default on their debt payments. During their bankruptcy, Ames closed 370 stores.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-09/news/9002170054_1_ames-department-stores-zayre-ames-shoppers \"Ames Cuts To Wipe Out Ex-zayres\"].  [[Chicago Tribune]], June 09, 1990.</ref> It was also during this time that Ames changed their logo, trading in their traditional red and white colors for the green color present in Zayre stores; this eventually became an identifying mark of most Ames stores.\n\n===Emergence from bankruptcy and acquisition of Hills===\nAfter successfully emerging from [[bankruptcy]] on December 30, 1992, the company returned to profitability in 1993 and improved its operating performance. Net income increased to $17.3 million for 1996 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|17300000|1996|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) (fiscal year ended January 25, 1997), compared with a net loss of $1.6 million for fiscal 1995 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|1600000|1995|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). Income before other charges and gains for the fiscal 1996 year was $33.3 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|33300000|1996|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), compared with $6.9 million in the prior fiscal year (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|6900000|1995|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), a $26.4 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|26400000|1996|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) improvement. During the 1990s, Ames was also known for moving into many former locations of their competitors. The chain added several [[Bradlees]] stores that were closed in the early part of the decade and opened 12 new stores in 1996, 11 of which were former [[Jamesway]] stores when that chain went out of business in late 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ames Department Stores Inc.|url=http://articles.courant.com/1996-06-02/business/9605300470_1_ames-department-stores-joseph-r-ettore-new-stores|date=1996-06-02}}</ref> Ames also took over several [[Caldor]] locations after their liquidation in 1999, as well as a few [[Montgomery Ward]] stores when that chain closed later that year.\n\nWith the acquisition of [[Hills Department Stores]] in 1998, Ames became the nation's fourth-largest discount retail chain behind [[Walmart]], [[Kmart]], and [[Target Corporation|Target]]. Although Hills was headquartered in suburban Boston, its stores were concentrated in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and western New York, which was a regional complement to Ames stores in the northeast. Then, Ames had just over 600 stores, mostly in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwest]], employing about 22,000.\n\n===Expansion into Chicago===\nIn 1986, Ames moved into the [[Chicago area]] by acquiring Zayre, and later in 2000 by acquiring all but one of the seven [[Goldblatt's]] department stores.<ref name=Chicagoland>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_4_39/ai_59649466|title=Ames comes to Chicagoland; Midwestern market right mix|date=|work=Discount Store News|access-date=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512165948/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_4_39/ai_59649466|archive-date=May 12, 2008|year=2000}}</ref> Other locations included former [[Venture Stores|Venture]] and [[Builders Square]] stores, making for a total of 11 stores. The company hoped to target the low-income and ethnic consumer, using techniques that were proven successful. \"The stores are generally on the South Side of Chicago, which has a low income base,\" a [[Ladenburg Thalmann]] analyst Beder said.<ref name=Chicagoland/> Before the opening day, a television marketing campaign showed cheery Ames employees working while singing \"[[My Kind of Town]],\" a song that strongly referred to Chicago. Billboards read, \"Our Kind of Town, Your Kind of Discount Store\". On September 21, 2000, Ames opened eight of its Chicago stores and opened the others shortly thereafter. A few months later, Ames opened a few additional stores.\n\n===1999\u20132002: Second bankruptcy and demise===\n[[File:AmesDepartmentStore.jpg|thumb|Former Ames in [[Dundalk, Maryland]]]]\nIn March 1999, Ames closed eight stores. In November 2000, Ames closed 32 stores, with 31 of them being the newly acquired Hills. (Some of these closings had been anticipated, as these were considered the weakest of the Hills chain.) On August 20, 2001, Ames closed another 47 stores. The company filed for [[bankruptcy protection]] for the second time. In November 2001, Ames closed 16 more stores and a [[distribution center]]. In December 2001, Ames closed 54 additional stores. Ames closed another six stores in June 2002, leaving the chain with 327 stores, about half of what they had in 1998.\n\nOn August 14, 2002, Ames' executives announced they would close the remaining 327 stores in the chain and wind down business, converting the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization to a [[Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] liquidation.<ref name=\"cbsnews-2002-08-14\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-518644.html |title=Ames Discount Chain To Close |work=[[CBS News]] |first=Bootie |last=Cosgrove-Mather |date=August 14, 2002}}</ref> \"Continued softness in sales, combined with tightening terms and slower shipments from our suppliers, have reduced our funds availability below critical levels,\" Ames' chairman and CEO Joseph R.

The company was founded in 1958 with a store in [[Southbridge, Massachusetts]], and at its peak operated 700 stores in 20 states, including the [[Northeast United States|Northeast]], [[Upland South|Upper South]], [[Midwest United States|Midwest]], and the [[District of Columbia]], making it the fourth largest discount retailer in the United States.\n\nDespite some success in its later years, Ames was plagued by debt and a slow decline in sales. This resulted in two bankruptcy filings that ultimately put an end to the chain. The company, despite expanding into other markets and taking over many closed stores that had been abandoned by competitors, went out of business in 2002.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Ames-lowville-ny.jpg|thumb|left|250px|A vacant Ames in [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville, New York]]. The \"shingle\" decor on the outside was typical of Ames stores built in the late 1970s.]]\n\nAmes began in 1958 when two Connecticut brothers, Milton and Irving Gilman, and Philip Feltman,<ref>\"Former Chief Executive of Ames store chain dies\".  [[Hartford Courant]], July 14, 1990.</ref> opened their first store in the Ames Worsted Textile Co. mill in Southbridge. The Gilmans and Feltman simply used the old sign of the textile mill for the new business. In 1971, this store was replaced with a modern store in [[Sturbridge, Massachusetts]]. A second store was opened in October, 1959 in [[St. Johnsbury, Vermont]].<ref name=TownCountryNews>{{cite news|title=AMES DISCOUNT DEPARTMENT STORE t Grand Opening Thursday Sept. 14|publisher=Town & Country News and Pulaski Democrat|date=September 13, 1978}}</ref>\n\nAmes' original business strategy brought discounting to the smaller towns and rural areas of the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. The company's success in serving a largely [[rural]] customer base in smaller, less-competitive markets resulted in consistently strong financial performance and steady growth combining acquisitions and an aggressive store-building program through the late 1980s.\n\nMany of the first stores were converted industrial sites, such as the first store in a former textile mill. Ames exploited the availability of cheap real estate in this manner in the first decades of the company, later moving to custom-built store facilities that provided standardized planning and marketing. Many Ames stores from the 1980s were the department store 'anchor store' for many discount mall developments.\n\nAmes' stock was added to the [[NYSE American|American Stock Exchange]] in May, 1967. The company later started trading on the [[NYSE]] in November, 1972.<ref name=TownCountryNews/>\n\n===Wave of expansion and first bankruptcy===\n[[File:Ames-seabrook-05.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The former [[Seabrook, New Hampshire]] Ames with the store's old red logo]]\n\nAmes acquired the 32-store \"Big N\" chain from [[Neisner Brothers]] in November 1978.<ref>{{cite web|title=Ames Department Stores, Inc. History|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/ames-department-stores-inc-history/|website=Funding Universe}}</ref> In 1984 Ames acquired the [[King's Department Stores]] chain and added most of its 193 stores to the fold. In 1985 Ames acquired [[G.C. Murphy]] of [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania]], a chain that operated both discount stores and [[variety stores]] (the variety stores and many of the smaller G.C. Murphy discount stores would eventually be sold by Ames to [[McCrory Stores]] in 1989). Three years after the acquisition of G.C. Murphy, Ames expanded further, acquiring the 392-store [[Zayre]] chain in 1988. Saddled with increased debt and hampered by the additional cost of converting those stores to Ames stores, the company suffered a significant reduction in profitability in late 1989 and early 1990. The Zayre chain also operated with stores concentrated in two distinct regions, the Northeast and Florida, which made coordination difficult.\n[[File:Ames Stores Logo Red.svg|thumb|left|Older Ames logo which used a red color scheme.]]\nIn April 1990, Ames filed for [[bankruptcy protection]] under [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. One of the causes of the bankruptcy appeared to be Ames' policy of extending [[credit (finance)#consumer credit|consumer credit]] to almost anyone who asked, without first checking their [[credit rating]], in an attempt to increase Ames' [[market share]]. Ames had also replaced the Zayre credit card program with [[Visa, Inc.|Visa]] cards that could be used anywhere Visa was accepted. This often resulted in Ames giving [[credit cards]] to customers who were already in [[debt]], and they tended to attract high risk borrowers who tended to default on their debt payments. During their bankruptcy, Ames closed 370 stores.<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-09/news/9002170054_1_ames-department-stores-zayre-ames-shoppers \"Ames Cuts To Wipe Out Ex-zayres\"].  [[Chicago Tribune]], June 09, 1990.</ref> It was also during this time that Ames changed their logo, trading in their traditional red and white colors for the green color present in Zayre stores; this eventually became an identifying mark of most Ames stores.\n\n===Emergence from bankruptcy and acquisition of Hills===\nAfter successfully emerging from [[bankruptcy]] on December 30, 1992, the company returned to profitability in 1993 and improved its operating performance. Net income increased to $17.3 million for 1996 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|17300000|1996|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) (fiscal year ended January 25, 1997), compared with a net loss of $1.6 million for fiscal 1995 (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|1600000|1995|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}). Income before other charges and gains for the fiscal 1996 year was $33.3 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|33300000|1996|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), compared with $6.9 million in the prior fiscal year (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|6900000|1995|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), a $26.4 million (equivalent to ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|26400000|1996|r=0}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) improvement. During the 1990s, Ames was also known for moving into many former locations of their competitors. The chain added several [[Bradlees]] stores that were closed in the early part of the decade and opened 12 new stores in 1996, 11 of which were former [[Jamesway]] stores when that chain went out of business in late 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ames Department Stores Inc.|url=http://articles.courant.com/1996-06-02/business/9605300470_1_ames-department-stores-joseph-r-ettore-new-stores|date=1996-06-02}}</ref> Ames also took over several [[Caldor]] locations after their liquidation in 1999, as well as a few [[Montgomery Ward]] stores when that chain closed later that year.\n\nWith the acquisition of [[Hills Department Stores]] in 1998, Ames became the nation's fourth-largest discount retail chain behind [[Walmart]], [[Kmart]], and [[Target Corporation|Target]]. Although Hills was headquartered in suburban Boston, its stores were concentrated in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and western New York, which was a regional complement to Ames stores in the northeast. Then, Ames had just over 600 stores, mostly in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]] and [[Midwest]], employing about 22,000.\n\n===Expansion into Chicago===\nIn 1986, Ames moved into the [[Chicago area]] by acquiring Zayre, and later in 2000 by acquiring all but one of the seven [[Goldblatt's]] department stores.<ref name=Chicagoland>{{cite news|last=|first=|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_4_39/ai_59649466|title=Ames comes to Chicagoland; Midwestern market right mix|date=|work=Discount Store News|access-date=|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512165948/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3092/is_4_39/ai_59649466|archive-date=May 12, 2008|year=2000}}</ref> Other locations included former [[Venture Stores|Venture]] and [[Builders Square]] stores, making for a total of 11 stores. The company hoped to target the low-income and ethnic consumer, using techniques that were proven successful. \"The stores are generally on the South Side of Chicago, which has a low income base,\" a [[Ladenburg Thalmann]] analyst Beder said.<ref name=Chicagoland/> Before the opening day, a television marketing campaign showed cheery Ames employees working while singing \"[[My Kind of Town]],\" a song that strongly referred to Chicago. Billboards read, \"Our Kind of Town, Your Kind of Discount Store\". On September 21, 2000, Ames opened eight of its Chicago stores and opened the others shortly thereafter. A few months later, Ames opened a few additional stores.\n\n===1999\u20132002: Second bankruptcy and demise===\n[[File:AmesDepartmentStore.jpg|thumb|Former Ames in [[Dundalk, Maryland]]]]\nIn March 1999, Ames closed eight stores. In November 2000, Ames closed 32 stores, with 31 of them being the newly acquired Hills. (Some of these closings had been anticipated, as these were considered the weakest of the Hills chain.) On August 20, 2001, Ames closed another 47 stores. The company filed for [[bankruptcy protection]] for the second time. In November 2001, Ames closed 16 more stores and a [[distribution center]]. In December 2001, Ames closed 54 additional stores. Ames closed another six stores in June 2002, leaving the chain with 327 stores, about half of what they had in 1998.\n\nOn August 14, 2002, Ames' executives announced they would close the remaining 327 stores in the chain and wind down business, converting the Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization to a [[Chapter 7 bankruptcy]] liquidation.<ref name=\"cbsnews-2002-08-14\">{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-518644.html |title=Ames Discount Chain To Close |work=[[CBS News]] |first=Bootie |last=Cosgrove-Mather |date=August 14, 2002}}</ref> \"Continued softness in sales, combined with tightening terms and slower shipments from our suppliers, have reduced our funds availability below critical levels,\" Ames' chairman and CEO Joseph R.

This trend has continued with many players representing New Zealand in two sports or representing two different countries in rugby league due to the eligibility rules in place at the time. For example, [[Dally Messenger]] represented Australia in both rugby union and rugby league as well as playing with the 1907 touring side.\n\nOf the 36 players that have played for both the Kiwis and the [[All Blacks]], only [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Sonny Bill Williams]]  have been a Kiwi before they became an All Black.\n\nAs well as the dual internationals below, [[Charles Savory]] won the New Zealand National Amateur Heavyweight Boxing championship in 1914, [[Sonny Bill Williams]] won the [[New Zealand Professional Boxing Association]] Heavyweight Championship in 2012 and Kiwis captain [[Puti Tipene Watene|Puti Tipene (Steve) Watene]] became a [[Member of Parliament]] after his retirement from rugby league.<ref name=akl100>Coffey, John and Bernie Wood ''Auckland, 100 years of rugby league, 1909-2009'', 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-86969-366-4}}, p.46</ref>\n\nFour Kiwis have gone on to be test referees; [[Albert House]], [[Maurice Wetherill]], [[Vic Belsham]] and [[Henry Perenara]].<ref>[http://www.nzrl.co.nz/media/63553/in%20touch%20nov%20dec%202011.pdf In Touch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150114025947/http://www.nzrl.co.nz/media/63553/in%20touch%20nov%20dec%202011.pdf |date=14 January 2015 }} ''New Zealand Rugby League'', December 2011</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" \n!width=\"100\"|Country!!width=\"80\"|Sport!!width=\"50\"|No.!!Players\n|-\n|[[All Blacks|New Zealand]]||rugby union||37||[[Albert Asher]], [[Frano Botica]], [[Alphonsus Carroll]], [[Bert Cooke (rugby)|Bert Cooke]], [[Tom Cross (rugby)|Tom Cross]], [[Marc Ellis (rugby)|Marc Ellis]], [[David Evans (rugby)|Dave Evans]], [[Charles Fitzgerald (rugby)|Charles Fitzgerald]], [[Arthur Francis (rugby)|Arthur Francis]], [[George A.

The village was erected on a so-called \u201csurowy korze\u0144\u201d (Eng. Raw Root) that is a forest area cleared for the purpose of founding a village. The surroundings of the village were never part of any knights estates. At first, they were inhabited only by peasants, who lived on 12 farms, 17 hectares each. The village's acreage was of about 300 ha. \nThere was also a watermill on the area belonging to Opoczka, but it was located away from the other houses, by the brook now called \u201cW\u0119gl\u00f3wka\u201d.\nThree large ponds were located at the border with the village Bojanic, they were owned by the landlords of Opoczka. Since the foundation of the village the inhabitants of Opoczka belonged to the parish in Makowice. During the Reformation most of the inhabitants of Opoczka converted to Lutheranism, and after the Thirty Years' War, until 1945, they tied themselves with the Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Pokoju (Eng. Church of Peace) in \u015awidnica.\nOpoczka went through different stages of development, with the greatest flourishing during the mid-19th Century. In 1845 there were 53 houses, a manor and an autonomous village magistrate's office in the village. At the same time first craftsmen arrived in the village and 8 weaving looms were set up. Later on also a blacksmith, an electric workshop and a stonemason's workshop were established, together with an Evangelical school.\nAfter World War II Opoczka was repopulated by repatriates mainly from the former Eastern Borderlands. The village had a typical agricultural character, the professional life was connected to farm work and stockbreeding. The cultural, entertainment and educational activities were all affiliated with the village community house. Village meetings, celebrations and events were carried out there.

The village was erected on a so-called \u201csurowy korze\u0144\u201d (Eng. Raw Root) that is a forest area cleared for the purpose of founding a village. The surroundings of the village were never part of any knights estates. At first, they were inhabited only by peasants, who lived on 12 farms, 17 hectares each. The village's acreage was of about 300 ha. \nThere was also a watermill on the area belonging to Opoczka, but it was located away from the other houses, by the brook now called \u201cW\u0119gl\u00f3wka\u201d.\nThree large ponds were located at the border with the village Bojanic, they were owned by the landlords of Opoczka. Since the foundation of the village the inhabitants of Opoczka belonged to the parish in Makowice. During the Reformation most of the inhabitants of Opoczka converted to Lutheranism, and after the Thirty Years' War, until 1945, they tied themselves with the Ko\u015bci\u00f3\u0142 Pokoju (Eng. Church of Peace) in \u015awidnica.\nOpoczka went through different stages of development, with the greatest flourishing during the mid-19th Century. In 1845 there were 53 houses, a manor and an autonomous village magistrate's office in the village. At the same time first craftsmen arrived in the village and 8 weaving looms were set up. Later on also a blacksmith, an electric workshop and a stonemason's workshop were established, together with an Evangelical school.\nAfter World War II Opoczka was repopulated by repatriates mainly from the former Eastern Borderlands. The village had a typical agricultural character, the professional life was connected to farm work and stockbreeding. The cultural, entertainment and educational activities were all affiliated with the village community house. Village meetings, celebrations and events were carried out there. Also training programmes, courses were conducted about household management, cuisine, tailoring and so on.\nBetween 1983 and the early 90's the \u201cHarcerski Teatr Bajki\u201d (Eng.

{"title_page": "Non-player character", "text_new": "{{short description|Game character not run by a player}}\n\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2012}}\n\nA '''non-player character''' ('''NPC''') is any [[Character (arts)|character]] in a [[game]] which is not controlled by a [[Player (game)|player]].<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=The Next Generation 1996 Lexicon A to Z: NPC (Nonplayer Character)|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=15 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=March 1996|page=38}}</ref> The term originated in traditional [[tabletop role-playing game]]s, where it applies to characters controlled by the [[gamemaster|gamemaster or referee]], rather than another player. In video games, this usually means a character controlled by the computer via algorithmic, predetermined or responsive behavior, but not necessarily true [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].\n\n==Role-playing games==\nIn a traditional [[tabletop role-playing game]] such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', an NPC is a [[fiction]]al character portrayed by the [[gamemaster]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Bill|last1=Slavicsek|first2=Richard|last2=Baker|title=Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies|date=April 8, 2005|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780764599248|page=73}}</ref> If [[player character]]s form the narrative's protagonists, non-player characters can be thought of as the \"supporting cast\" or \"extras\" of a roleplaying narrative. Non-player characters populate the fictional world of the game, and can fill any role not occupied by a [[player character]] (PC). Non-player characters might be allies, bystanders or competitors to the PCs. NPCs can also be traders that trade currency for things such as equipment or gear. NPCs thus vary in their level of detail. Some may be only a brief description (\"You see a man in a corner of the tavern\"), while others may have complete game [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] and [[backstory|backstories]] of their own.\n\nThere is some debate about how much work a [[gamemaster]] should put into an important NPC's statistics; some players prefer to have every NPC completely defined with stats, skills, and gear, while others define only what is immediately necessary and fill in the rest as the game proceeds. There is also some discussion as to just how important fully defined NPCs are in any given RPG, but it is general consensus that the more \"real\" the NPCs feel, the more fun players will have interacting with them in character.\n\n===Playability===\nIn some games and in some circumstances, a player who is without a [[player character]] of their own can temporarily take control of an NPC. Reasons for this vary, but often arise from the player not maintaining a PC within the group and playing the NPC for a session or from the player's PC being unable to act for some time (for example, because they are injured or in another location). Although these characters are still designed and normally controlled by the gamemaster, when players are given the opportunity to temporarily control these non-player characters it gives them another perspective on the plot of the game. Some systems, such as ''[[Nobilis]]'', encourage this in their rules.\n\nIn less traditional RPGs, narrative control is less strictly separated between gamemaster and players. In this case, the line between PC and NPC can be vague.\n\n===Dependents===\nMany game systems have rules for characters sustaining positive allies in the form of NPC followers; hired hands, or other dependent stature to the PC. Characters may sometimes help in the design, recruitment, or development of NPCs.\n\nIn the ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' game (and related games using the [[Hero System]]), a character may have a DNPC, or \"dependent non-player character\". This is a character controlled by the GM, but for which the [[player character]] is responsible in some way, and who may be put in harm's way by the PC's choices.\n\n==Video games==\n{{see also|Video game bot|Mob (gaming)|Boss (video gaming)}}\nThe term ''non-player character'' is also used in [[video game]]s to describe entities not under the direct control of a player. The term carries a connotation that the character is not hostile towards players; hostile characters are referred to as enemies, [[Mob (computer gaming)|mobs]], or creeps. In video games, NPC is sometimes expanded as \"non-playable character\" or \"non-player class\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nNPC behavior in computer games is usually scripted and automatic, triggered by certain actions or dialogue with the player characters. In certain multi-player games (''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' and ''[[Vampire: the Masquerade]]'' series, for example) a player that acts as the GM can \"possess\" both player and non-player characters, controlling their actions in order to further the storyline.  More complex games, such as the aforementioned ''Neverwinter Nights'', allow the player to customize the NPCs' behavior by modifying their default scripts or creating entirely new ones.\n\nIn some online games, such as [[MMORPG]]s, NPCs may be entirely unscripted, and are essentially regular character avatars controlled by employees of the game company. These \"non-players\" are often distinguished from player characters by avatar appearance or other visual designation, and often serve as in-game support for new players. In other cases, these \"live\" NPCs are virtual actors, playing regular characters which drive a continuing storyline (as in ''[[Myst Online: Uru Live]]'').\n\nIn early and less advanced RPGs, NPCs only had monologue. Code directs the appearance of a dialogue box, floating text, [[cutscene]], or other means of displaying the NPCs' speech or reaction to the player.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} NPC speeches of this kind are often designed to give an instant impression of the character of the speaker, providing character vignettes, but they may also advance the story or illuminate the world around the PC. Similar to this is the most common form of storytelling, non-branching dialogue, in which the means of displaying NPC speech are the same as above, but the [[player character]] or [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] responds to or initiates speech with NPCs. In addition to the purposes listed above, this enables development of the player character.\n\nMore advanced RPGs feature interactive dialogue, or [[Nonlinear gameplay|branching dialogue]] ([[Dialog tree|dialogue trees]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/27441/1/EDTree-Emotional%20Dialogue%20Trees%20for%20Game.pdf|format=PDF|title=EDTree: Emotional Dialogue Trees for Game Based Training|author1=Jay Collins|author2=William Hisrt|author3=Wen Tang|author4=Colin Luu|author5=Peter Smith|author6=Andrew Watson|author7=Reza Sahandi|website=Spirits.bournemouth.ac.uk|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> A good example are the games produced by [[Black Isle Studios]] and [[White Wolf, Inc.]]; every one of their games is multiple-choice roleplaying. When talking to an NPC, the player is presented with a list of dialogue options, and may choose between them. Each choice may result in a different response from the NPC. These choices may affect the course of the game, as well as the conversation. At the least, they provide a reference point to the player of his or her relationship with the game world.\n\n''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' is an example of a game series that has advanced from non-branching (''[[Ultima III]]'' and earlier) to branching dialogue (from ''[[Ultima IV]]'' and on). Other role-playing games with branching dialogues include ''[[Cosmic Soldier (MSX)|Cosmic Soldier]]'', ''[[Megami Tensei]]'', ''[[Fire Emblem]]'', ''[[Metal Max (series)|Metal Max]]'', ''[[Langrisser]]'', ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'', ''[[Template:Ogre Battle series|Ogre Battle]]'', ''[[Chrono (series)|Chrono]]'', ''[[Star Ocean]]'', ''[[Sakura Wars]]'', ''[[Mass Effect (series)|Mass Effect]]'', ''[[Dragon Age]]'', ''[[Radiant Historia]]'', and several ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games.\n\nCertain [[video game genres]] revolve almost entirely around interactions with non-player characters, including [[visual novel]]s such as ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' and [[dating sim]]s such as ''[[Tokimeki Memorial]]'', usually featuring complex branching dialogues and often presenting the player's possible responses word-for-word as the player character would say them. Games revolving around relationship-building, including visual novels, dating sims such as ''Tokimeki Memorial'', and some role-playing games such as ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Persona]]'', often give choices that have a different number of associated \"mood points\" which influence a player character's relationship and future conversations with a non-player character.

In video games, this usually means a character controlled by the computer via algorithmic, predetermined or responsive behavior, but not necessarily true [[Artificial intelligence (video games)|artificial intelligence]].\n\n==Role-playing games==\nIn a traditional [[tabletop role-playing game]] such as ''[[Dungeons & Dragons]]'', an NPC is a [[fiction]]al character portrayed by the [[gamemaster]].<ref>{{cite book|first1=Bill|last1=Slavicsek|first2=Richard|last2=Baker|title=Dungeons & Dragons For Dummies|date=April 8, 2005|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780764599248|page=73}}</ref> If [[player character]]s form the narrative's protagonists, non-player characters can be thought of as the \"supporting cast\" or \"extras\" of a roleplaying narrative. Non-player characters populate the fictional world of the game, and can fill any role not occupied by a [[player character]] (PC). Non-player characters might be allies, bystanders or competitors to the PCs. NPCs can also be traders that trade currency for things such as equipment or gear. NPCs thus vary in their level of detail. Some may be only a brief description (\"You see a man in a corner of the tavern\"), while others may have complete game [[Statistic (role-playing games)|statistics]] and [[backstory|backstories]] of their own.\n\nThere is some debate about how much work a [[gamemaster]] should put into an important NPC's statistics; some players prefer to have every NPC completely defined with stats, skills, and gear, while others define only what is immediately necessary and fill in the rest as the game proceeds. There is also some discussion as to just how important fully defined NPCs are in any given RPG, but it is general consensus that the more \"real\" the NPCs feel, the more fun players will have interacting with them in character.\n\n===Playability===\nIn some games and in some circumstances, a player who is without a [[player character]] of their own can temporarily take control of an NPC. Reasons for this vary, but often arise from the player not maintaining a PC within the group and playing the NPC for a session or from the player's PC being unable to act for some time (for example, because they are injured or in another location). Although these characters are still designed and normally controlled by the gamemaster, when players are given the opportunity to temporarily control these non-player characters it gives them another perspective on the plot of the game. Some systems, such as ''[[Nobilis]]'', encourage this in their rules.\n\nIn less traditional RPGs, narrative control is less strictly separated between gamemaster and players. In this case, the line between PC and NPC can be vague.\n\n===Dependents===\nMany game systems have rules for characters sustaining positive allies in the form of NPC followers; hired hands, or other dependent stature to the PC. Characters may sometimes help in the design, recruitment, or development of NPCs.\n\nIn the ''[[Champions (role-playing game)|Champions]]'' game (and related games using the [[Hero System]]), a character may have a DNPC, or \"dependent non-player character\". This is a character controlled by the GM, but for which the [[player character]] is responsible in some way, and who may be put in harm's way by the PC's choices.\n\n==Video games==\n{{see also|Video game bot|Mob (gaming)|Boss (video gaming)}}\nThe term ''non-player character'' is also used in [[video game]]s to describe entities not under the direct control of a player. The term carries a connotation that the character is not hostile towards players; hostile characters are referred to as enemies, [[Mob (computer gaming)|mobs]], or creeps. In video games, NPC is sometimes expanded as \"non-playable character\" or \"non-player class\".{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}\n\nNPC behavior in computer games is usually scripted and automatic, triggered by certain actions or dialogue with the player characters. In certain multi-player games (''[[Neverwinter Nights]]'' and ''[[Vampire: the Masquerade]]'' series, for example) a player that acts as the GM can \"possess\" both player and non-player characters, controlling their actions in order to further the storyline.  More complex games, such as the aforementioned ''Neverwinter Nights'', allow the player to customize the NPCs' behavior by modifying their default scripts or creating entirely new ones.\n\nIn some online games, such as [[MMORPG]]s, NPCs may be entirely unscripted, and are essentially regular character avatars controlled by employees of the game company. These \"non-players\" are often distinguished from player characters by avatar appearance or other visual designation, and often serve as in-game support for new players. In other cases, these \"live\" NPCs are virtual actors, playing regular characters which drive a continuing storyline (as in ''[[Myst Online: Uru Live]]'').\n\nIn early and less advanced RPGs, NPCs only had monologue. Code directs the appearance of a dialogue box, floating text, [[cutscene]], or other means of displaying the NPCs' speech or reaction to the player.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} NPC speeches of this kind are often designed to give an instant impression of the character of the speaker, providing character vignettes, but they may also advance the story or illuminate the world around the PC. Similar to this is the most common form of storytelling, non-branching dialogue, in which the means of displaying NPC speech are the same as above, but the [[player character]] or [[avatar (computing)|avatar]] responds to or initiates speech with NPCs. In addition to the purposes listed above, this enables development of the player character.\n\nMore advanced RPGs feature interactive dialogue, or [[Nonlinear gameplay|branching dialogue]] ([[Dialog tree|dialogue trees]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://eprints.bournemouth.ac.uk/27441/1/EDTree-Emotional%20Dialogue%20Trees%20for%20Game.pdf|format=PDF|title=EDTree: Emotional Dialogue Trees for Game Based Training|author1=Jay Collins|author2=William Hisrt|author3=Wen Tang|author4=Colin Luu|author5=Peter Smith|author6=Andrew Watson|author7=Reza Sahandi|website=Spirits.bournemouth.ac.uk|accessdate=10 October 2017}}</ref> A good example are the games produced by [[Black Isle Studios]] and [[White Wolf, Inc.]]; every one of their games is multiple-choice roleplaying. When talking to an NPC, the player is presented with a list of dialogue options, and may choose between them. Each choice may result in a different response from the NPC. These choices may affect the course of the game, as well as the conversation. At the least, they provide a reference point to the player of his or her relationship with the game world.\n\n''[[Ultima (series)|Ultima]]'' is an example of a game series that has advanced from non-branching (''[[Ultima III]]'' and earlier) to branching dialogue (from ''[[Ultima IV]]'' and on). Other role-playing games with branching dialogues include ''[[Cosmic Soldier (MSX)|Cosmic Soldier]]'', ''[[Megami Tensei]]'', ''[[Fire Emblem]]'', ''[[Metal Max (series)|Metal Max]]'', ''[[Langrisser]]'', ''[[SaGa (series)|SaGa]]'', ''[[Template:Ogre Battle series|Ogre Battle]]'', ''[[Chrono (series)|Chrono]]'', ''[[Star Ocean]]'', ''[[Sakura Wars]]'', ''[[Mass Effect (series)|Mass Effect]]'', ''[[Dragon Age]]'', ''[[Radiant Historia]]'', and several ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' games.\n\nCertain [[video game genres]] revolve almost entirely around interactions with non-player characters, including [[visual novel]]s such as ''[[Ace Attorney]]'' and [[dating sim]]s such as ''[[Tokimeki Memorial]]'', usually featuring complex branching dialogues and often presenting the player's possible responses word-for-word as the player character would say them. Games revolving around relationship-building, including visual novels, dating sims such as ''Tokimeki Memorial'', and some role-playing games such as ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Persona]]'', often give choices that have a different number of associated \"mood points\" which influence a player character's relationship and future conversations with a non-player character. These games often feature a [[Persistent world|day-night cycle]] with a time scheduling system that provides context and relevance to character interactions, allowing players to choose when and if to interact with certain characters, which in turn influences their responses during later conversations.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\">{{cite web|title=Defining Dialogue Systems|author=Brent Ellison|date=July 8, 2008|publisher=[[Gamasutra]]|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/feature/3719/defining_dialogue_systems.php|accessdate=2011-03-30}}</ref>\n\n==Insult==\n{{main|NPC (meme)}}\nOn the Internet, NPC is often used as an insult to suggest that some people are unable to form thoughts or opinions of their own.

He graduated from [[Kenmore High School]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kerry |last=Clawson |title=Vocal Music Teacher Leaves Akron Schools on High Note |url=http://www.ohio.com/news/local/vocal-music-teacher-leaves-akron-schools-on-high-note-1.491902 |work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]] |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-05-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Brainicide and Winter's Bane/British Steel===\nOwens began his musical career as the singer for Brainicide, a thrash metal band based in his home town of [[Akron, Ohio]] that had also been known as Dammage, Inc.<ref name=\"metal-archives.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Brainicide/53735#band_tab_discography|title=Brainicide - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=www.metal-archives.com|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> He recorded 3 demo tapes with them before the band split in 1989.<ref name=\"metal-archives.com\"/> Prior to joining [[Judas Priest]] in 1996, Owens fronted a band called [[Winter's Bane]], with whom he recorded an album called ''[[Heart of a Killer]]'' in 1993. He was most prominent in his role as the frontman of [[Judas Priest]] [[tribute band]] British Steel, named after the [[British Steel (album)|Judas Priest album]], although the bands Winter's Bane and British Steel were actually one and the same. The band would often open their shows as Winter's Bane in order to introduce the audience to their original material. After finishing their original set, they would then take a break, which included a wardrobe change to emulate the subject of their tribute, Judas Priest. Winter's Bane sound engineer Ken Reffner would come out from behind the soundboard, adding a fifth member to the stage. Reffner can be seen playing the part of [[K. K. Downing]] with British Steel in the Judas Priest episode of [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]''.\n\n===Judas Priest===\nOwens made headlines in 1996 when he went from being a fan of the [[heavy metal music|metal]] act [[Judas Priest]] to being their lead singer, replacing [[Rob Halford]]. Despite numerous rumors that Halford would reunite with Priest, Owens recorded two studio albums with his childhood heroes, as well as two live albums and a 2002 DVD release. Owens also helped write one Judas Priest song, \"What's My Name?\", which was a bonus track on ''[[Demolition (Judas Priest album)|Demolition]]''. With Judas Priest, he was nominated once for the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] in 1999, with the song \"Bullet Train\" from the album ''[[Jugulator]]'', but lost to [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Better than You (Metallica song)|Better than You]]\".\n\n====''Rock Star''====\nThe movie ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'' (2001), about a tribute band singer who is asked to join the band he has tried to imitate, was loosely based on Owens' career. Judas Priest disavowed the movie after they were denied creative control in the screenplay and script.<ref name=\"movie flap\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1444846/judas-priest-movie-flap.jhtml|title=Judas Priest Turn Their Backs on \"Rock Star\" Movie|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref> For example, in ''Rock Star'' the band throws out their original singer while on tour and replaces him a few days later; while in real life, Rob Halford was not thrown out, but left Judas Priest, four years before he was replaced. Owens said of the movie, \"They fabricated things and decided to pull away from my story and make their own because I guess mine was too normal. There's no telling what they put in there. If I could sue, I would.\"<ref name=\"movie flap\" />\n\n===Iced Earth and Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force===\nJudas Priest reunited with Rob Halford in 2003. Owens seized opportunity when, that same year, vocalist [[Matt Barlow]] quit [[Iced Earth]]. Iced Earth's first album with Owens, ''[[The Glorious Burden]]'', came out in early 2004. While singing with Judas Priest, Owens had toured with Iced Earth (and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]) in 2001, but the tour was cut short. In 2006, Owens also reunited with his former Winter's Bane colleague [[Dennis Hayes (bassist)|Dennis Hayes]] in a band called [[Beyond Fear]].

He first gained attention as the lead singer of [[Judas Priest]], and then [[Iced Earth]]. He took the nickname \"Ripper\" from the Judas Priest song \"[[The Ripper (song)|The Ripper]]\" during his time in the tribute band \"British Steel\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Prato|first=Greg|title=Tim \"Ripper\" Owens|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tim-quot-ripper-quot-owens-mn0000499459|work=Allmusic|accessdate=25 March 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nOwens was born on September 13, 1967, in [[Akron, Ohio]]. He graduated from [[Kenmore High School]] in 1985.<ref>{{cite news |first=Kerry |last=Clawson |title=Vocal Music Teacher Leaves Akron Schools on High Note |url=http://www.ohio.com/news/local/vocal-music-teacher-leaves-akron-schools-on-high-note-1.491902 |work=[[Akron Beacon Journal]] |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2014-05-30 }}</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\n===Brainicide and Winter's Bane/British Steel===\nOwens began his musical career as the singer for Brainicide, a thrash metal band based in his home town of [[Akron, Ohio]] that had also been known as Dammage, Inc.<ref name=\"metal-archives.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.metal-archives.com/bands/Brainicide/53735#band_tab_discography|title=Brainicide - Encyclopaedia Metallum: The Metal Archives|website=www.metal-archives.com|accessdate=6 March 2019}}</ref> He recorded 3 demo tapes with them before the band split in 1989.<ref name=\"metal-archives.com\"/> Prior to joining [[Judas Priest]] in 1996, Owens fronted a band called [[Winter's Bane]], with whom he recorded an album called ''[[Heart of a Killer]]'' in 1993. He was most prominent in his role as the frontman of [[Judas Priest]] [[tribute band]] British Steel, named after the [[British Steel (album)|Judas Priest album]], although the bands Winter's Bane and British Steel were actually one and the same. The band would often open their shows as Winter's Bane in order to introduce the audience to their original material. After finishing their original set, they would then take a break, which included a wardrobe change to emulate the subject of their tribute, Judas Priest. Winter's Bane sound engineer Ken Reffner would come out from behind the soundboard, adding a fifth member to the stage. Reffner can be seen playing the part of [[K. K. Downing]] with British Steel in the Judas Priest episode of [[VH1]]'s ''[[Behind the Music]]''.\n\n===Judas Priest===\nOwens made headlines in 1996 when he went from being a fan of the [[heavy metal music|metal]] act [[Judas Priest]] to being their lead singer, replacing [[Rob Halford]]. Despite numerous rumors that Halford would reunite with Priest, Owens recorded two studio albums with his childhood heroes, as well as two live albums and a 2002 DVD release. Owens also helped write one Judas Priest song, \"What's My Name?\", which was a bonus track on ''[[Demolition (Judas Priest album)|Demolition]]''. With Judas Priest, he was nominated once for the [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance]] in 1999, with the song \"Bullet Train\" from the album ''[[Jugulator]]'', but lost to [[Metallica]]'s \"[[Better than You (Metallica song)|Better than You]]\".\n\n====''Rock Star''====\nThe movie ''[[Rock Star (2001 film)|Rock Star]]'' (2001), about a tribute band singer who is asked to join the band he has tried to imitate, was loosely based on Owens' career. Judas Priest disavowed the movie after they were denied creative control in the screenplay and script.<ref name=\"movie flap\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1444846/judas-priest-movie-flap.jhtml|title=Judas Priest Turn Their Backs on \"Rock Star\" Movie|publisher=MTV.com}}</ref> For example, in ''Rock Star'' the band throws out their original singer while on tour and replaces him a few days later; while in real life, Rob Halford was not thrown out, but left Judas Priest, four years before he was replaced. Owens said of the movie, \"They fabricated things and decided to pull away from my story and make their own because I guess mine was too normal. There's no telling what they put in there. If I could sue, I would.\"<ref name=\"movie flap\" />\n\n===Iced Earth and Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force===\nJudas Priest reunited with Rob Halford in 2003. Owens seized opportunity when, that same year, vocalist [[Matt Barlow]] quit [[Iced Earth]]. Iced Earth's first album with Owens, ''[[The Glorious Burden]]'', came out in early 2004. While singing with Judas Priest, Owens had toured with Iced Earth (and [[Anthrax (American band)|Anthrax]]) in 2001, but the tour was cut short. In 2006, Owens also reunited with his former Winter's Bane colleague [[Dennis Hayes (bassist)|Dennis Hayes]] in a band called [[Beyond Fear]]. The self-titled debut album from his new band was released in May of that year. Hayes would join Iced Earth as well in 2007 after bassist James \"Bo\" Wallace left due to family health issues.\n\nOwens' stay in Iced Earth was short, however, as on December 11, 2007, guitarist [[Jon Schaffer]] announced that Owens would be leaving the band; Matt Barlow had been invited to return to the line-up after heavy feedback from fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=86574|title=Vocalist Matt Barlow Rejoins Iced Earth|publisher=Blabbermouth.net|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606234913/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=86574|archivedate=2011-06-06}}</ref>\n\nOn February 26, 2008, it was announced that Owens would be the new lead singer for [[Yngwie Malmsteen's Rising Force]], replacing [[Doogie White]].

States uniformly set 21 as the voting age, although Connecticut debated lowering it to 18 in 1819. In general young Americans were expected to be deferential to their elders, and John Adams famously cautioned that expanding suffrage would encourage \u201clads from twelve to twenty-one\u201d to demand the right to vote. <ref> Adams, John, The Works of John Adams, Second President of the United States, vol. 9, Ed. quoted in Charles Francis Adams (Boston, 1856), 378.</ref>\n\nYet as the suffrage expanded to non-property-holders in the early 1800s, young people came to play a larger role in politics. During the rise of Jacksonian Democracy, youths often organized Young Men\u2019s clubs in support of the Democratic, National Republican, Whig, or Anti-Masonic parties. <ref> Grinspan, Jon. (2016) The Virgin Vote: How Young Americans Made Democracy Social, Politics Personal, and Voting Popular in the Nineteenth Century, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press)</ref> Presidential campaigns often organized torch-lit rallies of thousands of marchers, and analyses of these club rosters show that members were often in their late teens and early twenties. <ref> Grinspan, Jon. (2009) \u201c\u2018Young Men for War\u2019: The Wide Awakes and Lincoln\u2019s 1860 Presidential Campaign.\u201d Journal of American History 96, 367.</ref> The demands of popular democracy \u2013 which often drew voter turnouts above 80% of eligible voters \u2013 led political machines to rely on youths as cheap, enthusiastic campaigners for political machines. In 1848, Abraham Lincoln suggested that Whig Party in Springfield, Illinois, make use of \u201cthe shrewd, wild boys about town, whether just of age or a little under age.\u201d <ref>Lincoln Abraham, June 22, 1848, Abraham Lincoln: The Collected Works, Eight Volumes, Ed. Roy P. Basler, (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 1: 491.</ref>\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1800s, young men enthusiastically cast their \u201cvirgin vote\u201d when turning 21. Voting was often seen as a rite of passage and public declaration of manhood, adulthood, and citizenship. Young African-Americans participated in voting and campaigning where they could vote, and young women, though prevented from voting themselves, followed politics closely, read partisan newspapers, and argued politics with the young men in their lives. <ref>Grinspan, Jon. (2016) The Virgin Vote.</ref>\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, political reformers reduced party\u2019s reliance on young activists in an effort to clean up politics. Youth turnout fell shortly thereafter, especially among first time \u201cvirgin voters,\u201d whose turnout declined 53% between 1888 and 1924. <ref>Kleppner, Paul. (1982), Who Voted? The Dynamics of Electoral Turnout, 1870-1980, (New York: Praeger, 1982), 68-9</ref> As turnout fell in the early 20th century, young people played less role in campaigning. Though individual campaigns, like those of Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, and John F. Kennedy in 1960, specifically appealed to youth, political parties generally showed less systematic interest in the youth vote.\n\nBy the late 1960s and early 1970s, young people demanded more of a role in American public life, eventually leading to the passage of the 26th amendment, lowering the voting age to 18 in 1971. Even after the passage of this amendment, voter turnout among 18-24 year olds fell throughout the 1970s, \u201880s, and \u201890s, although there seems to have been a resurgence in the last generation.\n\n==Variables affecting the youth vote in the United States==\n{{coatrack|date=June 2015|details=Many of these subsections contain information of a general nature, without many details on how the youth vote specifically is affected}}\nThe lack of youth participation in the voting process is not a random phenomenon. There are multiple variables that have an influence on the voting behaviors of youth in the United States.\n\n===Voting process===\nThe voting process has two steps.  An eligible voter - a U.S. citizen over the age of 18<ref name=\"Register to Vote\">{{cite web|title=Register to Vote|url=http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Voting/Register.shtml|website=USA.gov|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> - must first register to vote and then commit the act of voting.  The voting process is regulated by each state individually and therefore varies from state to state.<ref name=\"WH Elections\">{{cite web|title=Elections and Voting|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/elections-and-voting|website=The White House|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\nThe process of registering to vote is different depending on the state.<ref name=\"WH Elections\"/>  Pre-registration is available to youth under the age of 18 in 20 states and Washington D.C.<ref name=\"NCSL Pre-Reg\">{{cite web|title=Pre-registration for Young Voters|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/preregistration-for-young-voters.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> Potential voters may also register on Election Day - or on the day on which they vote early - in 10 states and Washington D.C.<ref name=\"NCSL - SD Reg\">{{cite web|title=Same Day Voter Registration|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  This may be done at the polling place or at an election official's office.<ref name=\"NCSL - SD Reg\"/>  Residents of the 40 states which do not allow same day registration require potential voters to register by a deadline, typically from eight to 30 days  out from the election.<ref name=\"NCSL - SD Reg\"/>  Over half of the states in the U.S. offer some sort or online voter registration.<ref name=\"NCSL - Web VR\">{{cite web|title=Online Voter Registration|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  This consists of the same process as a paper registration form, only it is digital on the internet and send to election officials to review over the web.  This process was first introduced in Arizona in 2002.<ref name=\"NCSL - Web VR\"/> \nThere are different regulations on the time and avenue through which a citizen can vote.  Early voting is available in 33 states and Washington D.C.  This must be done in person at a designated polling place.  Early voting period lengths vary from state to state.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\">{{cite web|title=Absentee and Early Voting|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx|website=The National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  If a potential voter is not able to vote in person on Election Day or during the early voting period, they may request an absentee ballot.  In 20 states, an excuse must be filed to receive the absentee ballot.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\" /> In 27 states and Washington D.C., a voter may acquire an absentee ballot without an excuse.  In Washington, Oregon and Colorado all voting is done through the mail.  A ballot is mailed to the voters residence and after the voter fills it out, he/she may mail it back.  No in person polls are conducted.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\" /> Otherwise, the typical voting period is twelve hours on a weekday at which time voters must go to the polls in person and cast their votes.\n\n===Two party system===\nThe winner-take-all system in the United States limits the success of [[Third party (United States)|third party]] candidates who may have a difficult time achieving an electoral majority.<ref name=OC />  Young people are increasingly supporting third party candidates, though the American political system has continued to foster a [[two-party system]].  In 1992, [[Ross Perot]], a third party candidate for president, won 22 percent of the eighteen-to-twenty-four-year-old vote, his strongest performance among any demographic group\".<ref name=OC />  These third party candidates who gain such support from the youth of the U.S. do not benefit from major party coffers - they must campaign by themselves.\n\n===Money in politics===\n\nIn nine out of ten elections, the candidate who spends the most money is elected.<ref name=OC /> The average cost of a successful campaign for the [[United States House of Representatives]] is nearly half a million dollars.<ref name=OC />  A large portion of this money comes from \"large individual contributions\" \u2013 an average of 74 percent of the campaign funds raised in the 2012 presidential election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were large individual contributions.

As youth change residences often, the local issues and elections relevant to the area may not affect the youth yet or be significant and change from residence to residence.<ref name=OC /> College students face the decision whether to stay registered in their hometowns or to register in the community in which they will reside.<ref name=OC /> The fewer federal tax obligations that apply to youth ages 18\u201324 only loosely tie them to the government and policy making decisions and do not entice youth to vote and make a change.<ref name=OC />\n\n===Lack of candidate contact===\n\nYoung people complain that those in politics do not communicate with them.<ref name=OC />  Political candidates and their campaigns know, through past election data, that youth are not a reliable voting group and choose to spend their campaign dollars on those who are more likely to turn out to vote.  For this reason, candidates tend to focus on issues that pertain to their targeted voters to gain their support, further discouraging youth voters.  The discouraged youth complete the cycle of neglect by not turning out to vote, proving to candidates that the youth are not a reliable voting group.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  \"Elected officials respond to the preferences of voters, not non-voters,\" therefore ignoring the youth of America who do not turn out to vote.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\n\n===Volunteering efforts===\n\nThough many consider voting a civic activity, youth today seem to have separated the political from the civic.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  Youth often participate in volunteer opportunities, fundraisers and other activist activities.

An example of a fairly successful voter registration drive would be the \"Reggie the Rig\" drive by the [[Republican National Committee]] in the 2004 election.  With a goal of registering three million new voters, the \"Reggie the Rig\" bus travelled to college campuses, a place to reach thousands of youth at once.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  During the same election, the Democrats held their own campus visits, but instead of focusing on registration, the Kerry campaign spread the word about their youth policy platform called Compact with the Next Generation.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  The Democrats also placed targeted ads on TV during shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Daily Show]]'' with Jon Stewart.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  This targeted campaign on TV has often been supplemented with outreach through the internet in modern campaigns.  New technology, the internet especially, is making it easier for candidates to reach the youth.  It has been found that \"young people who encounter campaign information on their own accord and spend time interacting with political material may come to see themselves interested in politics.\"<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\n\nYoung adults are \"over-represented among all computer and Internet users\" \u2013 three fourths of Americans under the age of 18 are able to access a computer and, on average, use it for half an hour a day.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />   As the Internet and computers have become more accessible to youth, such methods have been used to seek and find information and share it on social media cites. Websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]] not only allow youth who don't subscribe to newspapers or watch the evening news to stay on top of the polls, but also allows them to share their opinions of the polls and candidates.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Von Drehle, David. \"Why Young Voters Care Again.\" Time Magazine.

The [[National Voter Registration Act]] (NVRA), often called the \"motor-voter\" law, passed in 1993, allows those 18 years and older to register to vote at a driver's license office or public assistance agency.<ref name=OC />  The law also required states to accept a uniform mail-in voter registration application.<ref name=OC />  Additionally, some states have extended the period in which citizens can vote instead of requiring a vote within 12 hours on a single day.<ref name=OC />\n\nTwo cities in [[Maryland]], [[Takoma Park]] and [[Hyattsville]] allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections.<ref>[http://vote16usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Resources.Fact-Sheet.pdf]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Youth politics]]\n*[[Youth suffrage]]\n*[[Young Voters for the President]]\n*[[Apathy is Boring]], a Canadian non-profit and non-partisan organization that promotes youth involvement in politics\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* John B.

States uniformly set 21 as the voting age, although Connecticut debated lowering it to 18 in 1819. In general young Americans were expected to be deferential to their elders, and John Adams famously cautioned that expanding suffrage would encourage \u201clads from twelve to twenty-one\u201d to demand the right to vote. <ref> Adams, John, The Works of John Adams, Second President of the United States, vol. 9, Ed. quoted in Charles Francis Adams (Boston, 1856), 378.</ref>\n\nYet as the suffrage expanded to non-property-holders in the early 1800s, young people came to play a larger role in politics. During the rise of Jacksonian Democracy, youths often organized Young Men\u2019s clubs in support of the Democratic, National Republican, Whig, or Anti-Masonic parties. <ref> Grinspan, Jon. (2016) The Virgin Vote: How Young Americans Made Democracy Social, Politics Personal, and Voting Popular in the Nineteenth Century, (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press)</ref> Presidential campaigns often organized torch-lit rallies of thousands of marchers, and analyses of these club rosters show that members were often in their late teens and early twenties. <ref> Grinspan, Jon. (2009) \u201c\u2018Young Men for War\u2019: The Wide Awakes and Lincoln\u2019s 1860 Presidential Campaign.\u201d Journal of American History 96, 367.</ref> The demands of popular democracy \u2013 which often drew voter turnouts above 80% of eligible voters \u2013 led political machines to rely on youths as cheap, enthusiastic campaigners for political machines. In 1848, Abraham Lincoln suggested that Whig Party in Springfield, Illinois, make use of \u201cthe shrewd, wild boys about town, whether just of age or a little under age.\u201d <ref>Lincoln Abraham, June 22, 1848, Abraham Lincoln: The Collected Works, Eight Volumes, Ed. Roy P. Basler, (New Brunswick: Rutgers University Press, 1953), 1: 491.</ref>\n\nIn the mid-to-late 1800s, young men enthusiastically cast their \u201cvirgin vote\u201d when turning 21. Voting was often seen as a rite of passage and public declaration of manhood, adulthood, and citizenship. Young African-Americans participated in voting and campaigning where they could vote, and young women, though prevented from voting themselves, followed politics closely, read partisan newspapers, and argued politics with the young men in their lives. <ref>Grinspan, Jon. (2016) The Virgin Vote.</ref>\n\nAround the turn of the 20th century, political reformers reduced party\u2019s reliance on young activists in an effort to clean up politics. Youth turnout fell shortly thereafter, especially among first time \u201cvirgin voters,\u201d whose turnout declined 53% between 1888 and 1924. <ref>Kleppner, Paul. (1982), Who Voted? The Dynamics of Electoral Turnout, 1870-1980, (New York: Praeger, 1982), 68-9</ref> As turnout fell in the early 20th century, young people played less role in campaigning. Though individual campaigns, like those of Theodore Roosevelt in 1904, Franklin Delano Roosevelt in 1932, and John F. Kennedy in 1960, specifically appealed to youth, political parties generally showed less systematic interest in the youth vote.\n\nBy the late 1960s and early 1970s, young people demanded more of a role in American public life, eventually leading to the passage of the 26th amendment, lowering the voting age to 18 in 1971. Even after the passage of this amendment, voter turnout among 18-24 year olds fell throughout the 1970s, \u201880s, and \u201890s, although there seems to have been a resurgence in the last generation.\n\n==Variables affecting the youth vote in the United States==\n{{coatrack|date=June 2015|details=Many of these subsections contain information of a general nature, without many details on how the youth vote specifically is affected}}\nThe lack of youth participation in the voting process is not a random phenomenon. There are multiple variables that have an influence on the voting behaviors of youth in the United States.\n\n===Voting process===\nThe voting process has two steps.  An eligible voter - a U.S. citizen over the age of 18<ref name=\"Register to Vote\">{{cite web|title=Register to Vote|url=http://www.usa.gov/Citizen/Topics/Voting/Register.shtml|website=USA.gov|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> - must first register to vote and then commit the act of voting.  The voting process is regulated by each state individually and therefore varies from state to state.<ref name=\"WH Elections\">{{cite web|title=Elections and Voting|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/our-government/elections-and-voting|website=The White House|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>\nThe process of registering to vote is different depending on the state.<ref name=\"WH Elections\"/>  Pre-registration is available to youth under the age of 18 in 20 states and Washington D.C.<ref name=\"NCSL Pre-Reg\">{{cite web|title=Pre-registration for Young Voters|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/preregistration-for-young-voters.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> Potential voters may also register on Election Day - or on the day on which they vote early - in 10 states and Washington D.C.<ref name=\"NCSL - SD Reg\">{{cite web|title=Same Day Voter Registration|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-registration.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  This may be done at the polling place or at an election official's office.<ref name=\"NCSL - SD Reg\"/>  Residents of the 40 states which do not allow same day registration require potential voters to register by a deadline, typically from eight to 30 days  out from the election.<ref name=\"NCSL - SD Reg\"/>  Over half of the states in the U.S. offer some sort or online voter registration.<ref name=\"NCSL - Web VR\">{{cite web|title=Online Voter Registration|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/electronic-or-online-voter-registration.aspx|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  This consists of the same process as a paper registration form, only it is digital on the internet and send to election officials to review over the web.  This process was first introduced in Arizona in 2002.<ref name=\"NCSL - Web VR\"/> \nThere are different regulations on the time and avenue through which a citizen can vote.  Early voting is available in 33 states and Washington D.C.  This must be done in person at a designated polling place.  Early voting period lengths vary from state to state.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\">{{cite web|title=Absentee and Early Voting|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx|website=The National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  If a potential voter is not able to vote in person on Election Day or during the early voting period, they may request an absentee ballot.  In 20 states, an excuse must be filed to receive the absentee ballot.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\" /> In 27 states and Washington D.C., a voter may acquire an absentee ballot without an excuse.  In Washington, Oregon and Colorado all voting is done through the mail.  A ballot is mailed to the voters residence and after the voter fills it out, he/she may mail it back.  No in person polls are conducted.<ref name=\"NCSL Voting\" /> Otherwise, the typical voting period is twelve hours on a weekday at which time voters must go to the polls in person and cast their votes.\n\n===Two party system===\nThe winner-take-all system in the United States limits the success of [[Third party (United States)|third party]] candidates who may have a difficult time achieving an electoral majority.<ref name=OC />  Young people are increasingly supporting third party candidates, though the American political system has continued to foster a [[two-party system]].  In 1992, [[Ross Perot]], a third party candidate for president, won 22 percent of the eighteen-to-twenty-four-year-old vote, his strongest performance among any demographic group\".<ref name=OC />  These third party candidates who gain such support from the youth of the U.S. do not benefit from major party coffers - they must campaign by themselves.\n\n===Money in politics===\n\nIn nine out of ten elections, the candidate who spends the most money is elected.<ref name=OC /> The average cost of a successful campaign for the [[United States House of Representatives]] is nearly half a million dollars.<ref name=OC />  A large portion of this money comes from \"large individual contributions\" \u2013 an average of 74 percent of the campaign funds raised in the 2012 presidential election between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney were large individual contributions. An average of 25 percent of presidential campaign funds in 2012 were made in \"small individual contributions.\"<ref name=OS>{{cite web|title=Source of Funds|url=https://www.opensecrets.org/pres12/sourceall.php|website=OpenSecrets.org|publisher=Center for Responsive Politics|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>  The Supreme Court rulings on Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission in 2010 and SpeechNow.org v.

As youth change residences often, the local issues and elections relevant to the area may not affect the youth yet or be significant and change from residence to residence.<ref name=OC /> College students face the decision whether to stay registered in their hometowns or to register in the community in which they will reside.<ref name=OC /> The fewer federal tax obligations that apply to youth ages 18\u201324 only loosely tie them to the government and policy making decisions and do not entice youth to vote and make a change.<ref name=OC />\n\n===Lack of candidate contact===\n\nYoung people complain that those in politics do not communicate with them.<ref name=OC />  Political candidates and their campaigns know, through past election data, that youth are not a reliable voting group and choose to spend their campaign dollars on those who are more likely to turn out to vote.  For this reason, candidates tend to focus on issues that pertain to their targeted voters to gain their support, further discouraging youth voters.  The discouraged youth complete the cycle of neglect by not turning out to vote, proving to candidates that the youth are not a reliable voting group.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  \"Elected officials respond to the preferences of voters, not non-voters,\" therefore ignoring the youth of America who do not turn out to vote.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\n\n===Volunteering efforts===\n\nThough many consider voting a civic activity, youth today seem to have separated the political from the civic.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  Youth often participate in volunteer opportunities, fundraisers and other activist activities.  In this way, youth can make a difference in their communities and are able to see change immediately when seeing the larger picture of a movement, including the political aspect, may be more difficult or intangible.<ref name=OC />\n\n==Efforts to encourage youth vote==\n\n===Organizations===\nA variety of organizations worked to encourage young people to vote.<ref name=CNN18>{{cite news|first1=Hunter|last1=Schwarz|accessdate=2018-10-07|title=Voter registration is so hot right now|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/09/25/politics/voter-registration-day-millennials-midterms/index.html|newspaper=CNN}}</ref> [[Rock the Vote]], a platform used by grassroots campaigns,<ref name=\"YV 2004\" /><ref name=OC /><ref name=CNN18/> by 2018 had registered over 7 million votes and gained over 350 partners directing people to its online registration tool.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rockthevote.org/resources/online-voter-registration-tool/|title=Online Voter Registration Platform|access-date=2018-10-07}}</ref>\n\nEfforts before the 1970s include:\n* [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee]]\n*[[Black Panthers]]\n* [[Young Lords]]\n*[[Youth Liberation of Ann Arbor]]\n\nLater efforts include:\n* [[18 in '08]]\n*[https://www.18by.vote/ 18by.Vote]\n* Bus Federation Civic Fund\n* Center for Information and Research on Civic Learning and Engagement (CIRCLE) \n* [[College Republicans]] and [[College Democrats of America]] all over country\n* [[Declare Yourself]]<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* HeadCount, picked by the [[Ad Council]] in 2018 for a spot to be seen by 10 million\n* Hip Hop Summit Action Network<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* Inspire U.S.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.inspire-usa.org | title=Inspire U.S}}</ref>\n* [[League of Young Voters]] \n* MTV<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* [[National Stonewall Democrats]]<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* New Voters Project<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* [[New York Public Interest Research Group]] (NYPIRG)\n* [[Sean Combs]]'s \"Vote or Die\" campaign<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* Spitfire Strategies<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* [[Our Time (nonprofit)|Our Time]] \n* TurboVote.org (with Snapchat and others)<ref>{{cite news|date=2018-10-24|title=Snapchat Helped Register Over 400,000 Voters|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/23/technology/snapchat-voter-registration-midterms.html}}</ref>\n* [[When We All Vote]], co-chaired by [[Michelle Obama]]<ref name=CNN18/>\n* World Wrestling Entertainment's Smackdown Your Vote<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* Young Greens Caucus\n* Young Voter PAC \n* Young Voter's Alliance<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />\n* YouthVote USA\n\n===Campaign strategies===\n\nBecause the youth population is so large, many campaigns try to gain their support during elections.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" /> Efforts to capture the youth vote include [[Voter registration campaign|registration drives]], outreach and specifically youth-friendly policy platforms.  An example of a fairly successful voter registration drive would be the \"Reggie the Rig\" drive by the [[Republican National Committee]] in the 2004 election.  With a goal of registering three million new voters, the \"Reggie the Rig\" bus travelled to college campuses, a place to reach thousands of youth at once.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  During the same election, the Democrats held their own campus visits, but instead of focusing on registration, the Kerry campaign spread the word about their youth policy platform called Compact with the Next Generation.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  The Democrats also placed targeted ads on TV during shows such as ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' and ''[[The Daily Show]]'' with Jon Stewart.<ref name=\"YV 2004\" />  This targeted campaign on TV has often been supplemented with outreach through the internet in modern campaigns.  New technology, the internet especially, is making it easier for candidates to reach the youth.  It has been found that \"young people who encounter campaign information on their own accord and spend time interacting with political material may come to see themselves interested in politics.\"<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\n\nYoung adults are \"over-represented among all computer and Internet users\" \u2013 three fourths of Americans under the age of 18 are able to access a computer and, on average, use it for half an hour a day.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />   As the Internet and computers have become more accessible to youth, such methods have been used to seek and find information and share it on social media cites. Websites such as [[Facebook]] and [[YouTube]] not only allow youth who don't subscribe to newspapers or watch the evening news to stay on top of the polls, but also allows them to share their opinions of the polls and candidates.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Von Drehle, David. \"Why Young Voters Care Again.\" Time Magazine. Feb 2008:34-48</ref>  If the use of technology were to be fully integrated into politics, the youth and adult groups would be equally active in politics.<ref name=\"Tech and Poli\" />\nOnline news media, in particular, is believed to have a positive impact on young citizens due to its interactivity.<ref name=\"journals.sagepub.com\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1177/0267323112465369|title = Age and the effects of news media attention and social media use on political interest and participation: Do social media function as leveller?| journal=European Journal of Communication| volume=28| pages=19\u201334|year = 2013|last1 = Holt|first1 = Kristoffer| last2=Shehata| first2=Adam| last3=Str\u00f6mb\u00e4ck| first3=Jesper| last4=Ljungberg| first4=Elisabet}}</ref>\nIt not only provides them with the information they need to form their political beliefs and to become more informed regarding democracy and to gain a better understanding of current issues. But, it also provides them with a platform to discuss these ideas with other individuals, not only on a more localized scale but also on a global scale.<ref name=\"journals.sagepub.com\"/>\n\n===Legislation===\n\nIn the United States, there has been legislation passed that helped youth access the vote.  The [[National Voter Registration Act]] (NVRA), often called the \"motor-voter\" law, passed in 1993, allows those 18 years and older to register to vote at a driver's license office or public assistance agency.<ref name=OC />  The law also required states to accept a uniform mail-in voter registration application.<ref name=OC />  Additionally, some states have extended the period in which citizens can vote instead of requiring a vote within 12 hours on a single day.<ref name=OC />\n\nTwo cities in [[Maryland]], [[Takoma Park]] and [[Hyattsville]] allow 16 and 17-year-olds to vote in local elections.<ref>[http://vote16usa.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Resources.Fact-Sheet.pdf]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Youth politics]]\n*[[Youth suffrage]]\n*[[Young Voters for the President]]\n*[[Apathy is Boring]], a Canadian non-profit and non-partisan organization that promotes youth involvement in politics\n\n== Further reading ==\n\n* John B.
