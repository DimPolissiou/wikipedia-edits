The club has three men's teams, a women's team and a mini rugby section. \n\nThe club was formed in 1967 by workers at the [[Kolster-Brandes]] (later [[ITT Corporation|ITT]], and then [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]]) Factory in [[Foots Cray]], Kent.

She seeks to find a way to get out of the park to continue her revenge, and knows she must recover her father Peter's \"pearl\" to do so and unlock Westworld's true secrets with it. Charlotte, who was attempting to smuggle Westworld data through Peter, also seeks the host as she cannot call for extraction without that data. Bernard still struggles with the fact he is a host, and comes to learn that Dr. Ford still has significant influence on him and the park. Maeve is aided by Lee and Hector to find her daughter, while learning there are many other parks to Westworld. The Man in Black is forced to come to terms with why he has spent so much time in the park when he encounters his daughter Emily.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Westworld characters}}\n===Main===\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Dolores Abernathy<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-season-2-all-details-far-1081834|title='Westworld' Season 2: All the Details (So Far)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Josh|last=Wigler|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Thandie Newton]] as Maeve Millay<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/>\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as Bernard Lowe / Arnold Weber<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/>\n* [[James Marsden]] as Teddy Flood<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/01/11/james-marsden-westworld-season-2/|title=James Marsden: 'Westworld' season 2 is 'so much bigger'|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Maureen Lee|last=Lenker|date=January 11, 2018|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Tessa Thompson]] as Charlotte Hale / Dolores Abernathy<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\"/>\n* [[Fares Fares]] as Antoine Costa<ref name=\"Aug2017Casting\"/>{{efn|name=s2|Credited with the main cast in the episodes in which they appear.}}\n* [[Luke Hemsworth]] as Ashley Stubbs<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/westworld/news/a851184/westworld-season-2-cast-tessa-thompson/|title=Westworld announces returning cast for season 2, including Tessa Thompson and more fan-favourites|date=March 1, 2018|work=Digital Spy|first=Justin|last=Harp|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Louis Herthum]] as Peter Abernathy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/westworld-louis-herthum-promoted-series-regular-season-2-hbo-1202052806/|title='Westworld': Louis Herthum Upped To Series Regular For Season 2 On HBO|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=April 8, 2017}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Simon Quarterman]] as Lee Sizemore<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\"/>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Talulah Riley]] as Angela<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/03/23/westworld-season-2-angela/|title=Westworld season 2 makes Talulah Riley a (very deadly) series regular|last=Hibberd|first=James|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 23, 2017|accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Hector Escaton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westworldwatchers.com/2017/08/14/rodrigo-santoro-confirmed-westworld-season-2/|title=Rodrigo Santoro Confirmed for Westworld Season 2! - Westworld Watchers|date=August 14, 2017|work=Westworld Watchers|first=Dylan|last=Moir|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Karl Strand<ref name=\"Aug2017Casting\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/westworld-season-2-cast-1202521782/|title='Westworld' Season 2 Adds Three Actors, Including 'Vikings' Star|work=Variety|first=Joe|last=Otterson|date=August 9, 2017|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Ed Harris]] as William {{a.k.a.}} the Man in Black<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/>\n* [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] as Armistice<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2016/12/05/westworld-season-2-spoilers-interview-ford-dolores-flies/|title=Westworld EPs Dish Dolores' Decision, Ford's Plan, Other Parks and Season 2: 'We're Gonna See a Lot of Flies'|date=December 5, 2016|work=TVLine|first=Kimberly|last=Roots|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] as Lawrence<ref>{{cite tweet|user=ccollinsjr|author=Clifton Collins Jr.|number=884760645962416128|title=Here's to kiccing off day 1 @westworld on Mr. Yul Brynners bday \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfa5|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Angela Sarafyan]] as Clementine Pennyfeather<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\"/>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Katja Herbers]] as Emily Grace / Emily Grace (host replica)<ref name=\"Herbers\">{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/07/westworld-katja-herbers-cast-series-regular-season-2-hbo-1202126782/|title='Westworld': Katja Herbers Cast As New Series Regular For Season 2 Of HBO Series|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|last2=Petski|first2=Denise|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=July 11, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712095618/http://deadline.com/2017/07/westworld-katja-herbers-cast-series-regular-season-2-hbo-1202126782/|archivedate=July 12, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Shannon Woodward]] as Elsie Hughes<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\"/>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Robert Ford<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/was-that-anthony-hopkins-voice-in-westworld-premiere/ |title=So, Is Anthony Hopkins Really Gone From \u2018Westworld\u2019?

However, the experiment repeatedly failed and William shut it down. Bernard recalls that Ford had him retrieve the control unit of a second host-human hybrid, but cannot recall for whom it was intended. In the park, William and Lawrence return to Lawrence's home to find it overrun by Craddock and the surviving Confederados. Craddock torments the other hosts for sport until William and Lawrence overpower the Confederados and kill Craddock. Speaking through Lawrence's daughter, Ford warns William that one good deed does not redeem him. William rides west with the townspeople in tow where they meet Grace, who reveals herself to be William's daughter Emily Grace.\n |LineColor       = 9099AE\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|Westworld (season 2)\n |EpisodeNumber   = 15\n |EpisodeNumber2  = 5\n |Title           = [[Akane no Mai]]\n |DirectedBy      = [[Craig Zobel]]\n |WrittenBy       = Dan Dietz\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2018|5|20}}\n |ProdCode        = 205\n |Viewers         = 1.55<ref name=\"2.05\">{{cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/sunday-cable-ratings-may-20-2018/ |title=Sunday cable ratings: 'Fear the Walking Dead' dips opposite NBA Playoffs |work=TV by the Numbers |first=Rick |last=Porter |date=May 22, 2018 |accessdate=May 22, 2018}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = In Westworld, Dolores questions what to do with Teddy.

series)|Westworld]]'' (subtitled ''The Door'') premiered on [[HBO]] on April 22, 2018,  and concluded on June 24, 2018, consisting of ten episodes.\n\nThe television series was created by [[Jonathan Nolan]] and [[Lisa Joy]], and it is based on the [[Westworld (film)|1973 film of the same name]], written and directed by [[Michael Crichton]]. The second season stars an ensemble cast led by [[Evan Rachel Wood]], [[Thandie Newton]], [[Jeffrey Wright]], [[James Marsden]], [[Tessa Thompson]], and [[Ed Harris]].\n\nThe second season has received positive reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nAfter killing Dr. Ford from the end of season one, Dolores converts and leads the other hosts in killing many of the other guests in the few weeks that follow. She seeks to find a way to get out of the park to continue her revenge, and knows she must recover her father Peter's \"pearl\" to do so and unlock Westworld's true secrets with it. Charlotte, who was attempting to smuggle Westworld data through Peter, also seeks the host as she cannot call for extraction without that data. Bernard still struggles with the fact he is a host, and comes to learn that Dr. Ford still has significant influence on him and the park. Maeve is aided by Lee and Hector to find her daughter, while learning there are many other parks to Westworld. The Man in Black is forced to come to terms with why he has spent so much time in the park when he encounters his daughter Emily.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{main|List of Westworld characters}}\n===Main===\n{{Div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Evan Rachel Wood]] as Dolores Abernathy<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/westworld-season-2-all-details-far-1081834|title='Westworld' Season 2: All the Details (So Far)|work=The Hollywood Reporter|first=Josh|last=Wigler|date=February 5, 2018|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Thandie Newton]] as Maeve Millay<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/>\n* [[Jeffrey Wright]] as Bernard Lowe / Arnold Weber<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/>\n* [[James Marsden]] as Teddy Flood<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ew.com/tv/2018/01/11/james-marsden-westworld-season-2/|title=James Marsden: 'Westworld' season 2 is 'so much bigger'|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Maureen Lee|last=Lenker|date=January 11, 2018|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>\n* [[Tessa Thompson]] as Charlotte Hale / Dolores Abernathy<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\"/>\n* [[Fares Fares]] as Antoine Costa<ref name=\"Aug2017Casting\"/>{{efn|name=s2|Credited with the main cast in the episodes in which they appear.}}\n* [[Luke Hemsworth]] as Ashley Stubbs<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/westworld/news/a851184/westworld-season-2-cast-tessa-thompson/|title=Westworld announces returning cast for season 2, including Tessa Thompson and more fan-favourites|date=March 1, 2018|work=Digital Spy|first=Justin|last=Harp|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Louis Herthum]] as Peter Abernathy<ref>{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/03/westworld-louis-herthum-promoted-series-regular-season-2-hbo-1202052806/|title='Westworld': Louis Herthum Upped To Series Regular For Season 2 On HBO|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=March 27, 2017|accessdate=April 8, 2017}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Simon Quarterman]] as Lee Sizemore<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\"/>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Talulah Riley]] as Angela<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/03/23/westworld-season-2-angela/|title=Westworld season 2 makes Talulah Riley a (very deadly) series regular|last=Hibberd|first=James|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 23, 2017|accessdate=March 23, 2017}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Rodrigo Santoro]] as Hector Escaton<ref>{{cite web|url=http://westworldwatchers.com/2017/08/14/rodrigo-santoro-confirmed-westworld-season-2/|title=Rodrigo Santoro Confirmed for Westworld Season 2! - Westworld Watchers|date=August 14, 2017|work=Westworld Watchers|first=Dylan|last=Moir|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Gustaf Skarsg\u00e5rd]] as Karl Strand<ref name=\"Aug2017Casting\">{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/westworld-season-2-cast-1202521782/|title='Westworld' Season 2 Adds Three Actors, Including 'Vikings' Star|work=Variety|first=Joe|last=Otterson|date=August 9, 2017|accessdate=August 10, 2017}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Ed Harris]] as William {{a.k.a.}} the Man in Black<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter.com\"/>\n* [[Ingrid Bols\u00f8 Berdal]] as Armistice<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2016/12/05/westworld-season-2-spoilers-interview-ford-dolores-flies/|title=Westworld EPs Dish Dolores' Decision, Ford's Plan, Other Parks and Season 2: 'We're Gonna See a Lot of Flies'|date=December 5, 2016|work=TVLine|first=Kimberly|last=Roots|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Clifton Collins Jr.]] as Lawrence<ref>{{cite tweet|user=ccollinsjr|author=Clifton Collins Jr.|number=884760645962416128|title=Here's to kiccing off day 1 @westworld on Mr. Yul Brynners bday \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udfa5|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=April 14, 2018}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Angela Sarafyan]] as Clementine Pennyfeather<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\"/>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Katja Herbers]] as Emily Grace / Emily Grace (host replica)<ref name=\"Herbers\">{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2017/07/westworld-katja-herbers-cast-series-regular-season-2-hbo-1202126782/|title='Westworld': Katja Herbers Cast As New Series Regular For Season 2 Of HBO Series|last1=Andreeva|first1=Nellie|last2=Petski|first2=Denise|website=Deadline Hollywood|date=July 11, 2017|accessdate=July 11, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712095618/http://deadline.com/2017/07/westworld-katja-herbers-cast-series-regular-season-2-hbo-1202126782/|archivedate=July 12, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Shannon Woodward]] as Elsie Hughes<ref name=\"digitalspy.com\"/>{{efn|name=s2}}\n* [[Anthony Hopkins]] as Robert Ford<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uproxx.com/sepinwall/was-that-anthony-hopkins-voice-in-westworld-premiere/ |title=So, Is Anthony Hopkins Really Gone From \u2018Westworld\u2019?

William rescues Lawrence and heads to Pariah to recruit the host currently playing El Lazo. El Lazo, however, passes on a message from Ford, stating that William must complete the game on his own.

In addition to Parker's introduction, excerpts from several of the Spenser novels were included.<ref>[[The Tennessean]], 8 March 2009, Arts & Entertainment, p. 11</ref>\n\nParker created female detective Sunny Randall at the request of actress [[Helen Hunt]], who wanted him to write a part for her to play. He wrote the first book, and the film version was planned for 2000,<ref name=\"litweb\" /> but never materialized.<ref name=\"reporter\" />  However, his publisher liked the character and asked him to continue with the series.<ref name=\"reporter\" />\n\nAnother figure created by Parker was [[Jesse Stone (character)|Jesse Stone]], a troubled former [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective, who starts a new career as a police chief in a small New England town. Between 1997 and 2010, he wrote nine novels featuring Jesse Stone, all of which have been adapted as a series of TV movies by CBS starring [[Tom Selleck]] as Jesse Stone. \n\nAside from crime writing, Parker also produced several Western novels, including ''[[Appaloosa (novel)|Appaloosa]]'',<ref>This was adapted to film in 2008 by [[Ed Harris]], starring Harris (who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay), [[Viggo Mortensen]] and [[Jeremy Irons]]</ref> and children's books. Like Parker's Spenser series, his Westerns have received critical attention. Chris Dacus, who has written on other authors like Cormac McCarthy, has written of the intellectual depth and importance of Parker's Westerns in ''The Stoic Western Hero: Robert B. Parker's Westerns''.<ref>Dacus, Chris. The Stoic Western Hero: Robert B. Parker's Westerns.

It is named after their [[German Shorthaired Pointer|German short-haired pointer]], Pearl.<ref name=\"reporter\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nParker and his wife had two sons, David and Daniel.  Originally, the character of Spenser was to have been called \"David,\" but Parker didn't want to appear to favor one of his sons over the other.  Parker therefore omitted Spenser's first name entirely, and it was never revealed.\n\nParker and his wife, Joan, separated at one point but then came to an unusual arrangement. They lived in a three-story Victorian house just outside of Harvard Square; she lived on one floor and he on another, and they shared the middle floor. This living arrangement is mirrored in Spenser's private life: his girlfriend, Susan, had an aversion to marriage and living together full-time. Living separately suited them both, although they were fully committed to each other. Explaining the arrangement in an interview on ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning|CBS Sunday Morning]]'', Parker said, \"I want to make love to my wife for the rest of my life, but I never want to sleep with her again.\"\n\nHe had a great fondness for dogs, including German Pointers. Dogs were included in his Spenser stories, aging along with the character and appearing in the ongoing series of novels. The dogs were always named Pearl.<ref name=\"Globe 2013\">{{cite news|last1=Bissonette|first1=Zac|title=Robert B. Parker is dead. Long live Robert B.

In addition to Parker's introduction, excerpts from several of the Spenser novels were included.<ref>[[The Tennessean]], 8 March 2009, Arts & Entertainment, p. 11</ref>\n\nParker created female detective Sunny Randall at the request of actress [[Helen Hunt]], who wanted him to write a part for her to play. He wrote the first book, and the film version was planned for 2000,<ref name=\"litweb\" /> but never materialized.<ref name=\"reporter\" />  However, his publisher liked the character and asked him to continue with the series.<ref name=\"reporter\" />\n\nAnother figure created by Parker was [[Jesse Stone (character)|Jesse Stone]], a troubled former [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] detective, who starts a new career as a police chief in a small New England town. Between 1997 and 2010, he wrote nine novels featuring Jesse Stone, all of which have been adapted as a series of TV movies by CBS starring [[Tom Selleck]] as Jesse Stone. \n\nAside from crime writing, Parker also produced several Western novels, including ''[[Appaloosa (novel)|Appaloosa]]'',<ref>This was adapted to film in 2008 by [[Ed Harris]], starring Harris (who also directed and co-wrote the screenplay), [[Viggo Mortensen]] and [[Jeremy Irons]]</ref> and children's books. Like Parker's Spenser series, his Westerns have received critical attention. Chris Dacus, who has written on other authors like Cormac McCarthy, has written of the intellectual depth and importance of Parker's Westerns in ''The Stoic Western Hero: Robert B. Parker's Westerns''.<ref>Dacus, Chris. The Stoic Western Hero: Robert B. Parker's Westerns. CDI: 2011. https://www.amazon.com/Stoic-Western-Hero-Westerns-Part-ebook/dp/B006C2C7H4/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1378170886&sr=1-1&keywords=chris+dacus</ref>\n\nParker and his wife created an independent film company called Pearl Productions, based in [[Boston]]. It is named after their [[German Shorthaired Pointer|German short-haired pointer]], Pearl.<ref name=\"reporter\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nParker and his wife had two sons, David and Daniel.  Originally, the character of Spenser was to have been called \"David,\" but Parker didn't want to appear to favor one of his sons over the other.  Parker therefore omitted Spenser's first name entirely, and it was never revealed.\n\nParker and his wife, Joan, separated at one point but then came to an unusual arrangement. They lived in a three-story Victorian house just outside of Harvard Square; she lived on one floor and he on another, and they shared the middle floor. This living arrangement is mirrored in Spenser's private life: his girlfriend, Susan, had an aversion to marriage and living together full-time. Living separately suited them both, although they were fully committed to each other. Explaining the arrangement in an interview on ''[[CBS News Sunday Morning|CBS Sunday Morning]]'', Parker said, \"I want to make love to my wife for the rest of my life, but I never want to sleep with her again.\"\n\nHe had a great fondness for dogs, including German Pointers. Dogs were included in his Spenser stories, aging along with the character and appearing in the ongoing series of novels. The dogs were always named Pearl.<ref name=\"Globe 2013\">{{cite news|last1=Bissonette|first1=Zac|title=Robert B. Parker is dead. Long live Robert B.
