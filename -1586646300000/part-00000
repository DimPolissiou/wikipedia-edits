Estimates based on screening of [[leukemia]]-[[lymphoma]] cell lines suggest that about 15% of these cell lines are not representative of what they are usually assumed to be.{{Efn|(Masters, 2002)|name=|group=}} A project is currently underway to enumerate and rename contaminated cell lines to avoid errors in research caused by misattribution.{{Efn|(Drexler et al., 2002)|name=|group=}}\n\nContaminated cell lines have been extensively used in research without knowledge of their true character. For example, most if not all research on the [[endothelium]] ECV-304 or the [[megakaryocyte]] DAMI cell lines has in reality been conducted on [[urinary bladder|bladder]] [[carcinoma]] and [[erythroleukemia]] cells, respectively. Thus, all research on endothelium- or megakaryocyte-specific functions utilizing these cell lines has turned out to be misguided, serving more of a warning example.\n\nThere are two principal ways a cell line can become contaminated: cell cultures are often exchanged between research groups; if, during handling, a sample gets contaminated and then passed on, subsequent exchanges of cells will lead to the contaminating population being established, although parts of the supposed cell line are still genuine. More serious is contamination at the source: during establishment of the original cell line, some contaminating cells are accidentally introduced into the cultures, where they in time outgrow the desired cells. The initial testing, in this case, still suggested that the cell line is genuine and novel, but in reality, it has disappeared soon after being established and ''all'' samples of such cell lines are actually the contaminant cells. It requires lengthy research to determine the precise point where cell lines have become contaminated. A mix-up rated as contamination could in reality be a simple confusion of two cell lines, but usually contamination is assumed.{{citation needed|reason=Indeed all articles I have seen about the problem do that, but a dedicated reference would be nicer. Best would be one which refers to investigations of this possibility.|date=January 2018}}\n\nAfter a cell line has been discovered to be contaminated, it is usually never again used for research demanding the specific type of cell line they are assumed to be. Most cell lines are discarded, however sometimes contaminant cells have acquired novel characteristics (e.g., by [[mutation]] or viral [[transfection]], for example the [[HeLa]] derivate Det98) and thus constitute a novel lineage after all, so are not thrown away. If a cell line is thought to be contaminated, it is usually tested for authenticity.{{Efn|The references listed below contain some papers on how common contaminates can be recognized.|name=|group=}} The widespread contamination of HeLa cells was initially recognized by [[Walter Nelson-Rees]] using simple [[Giemsa]] stain [[karyotype|karyotyping]] under a [[light microscope]]. This technique works well in recognizing HeLa because these cells have distinctive [[chromosome]] aberrations. Novel cell lines are proliferated and distributed and/or deposited at a safekeeping institution such as the [[American Type Culture Collection|ATCC]] as soon as possible after establishment, to minimize the odds that the line becomes spoiled by contamination. It is considered [[Good Laboratory Practice|good practice]] to periodically check cell lines maintained under laboratory conditions (i.e., not placed in long-term storage) for contamination with HeLa or other common contaminants, to ensure that their quality and integrity is maintained.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Lists of contaminated cell lines ==\n\nThis list, containing 488 cell lines, was last updated on 1 December 2016.{{Efn|An updated list can be obtained from International Cell Line Authentication Committee website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iclac.org/wp-content/uploads/Cross-Contaminations-v8_0.pdf |title=Database of Cross-Contaminated or Misidentified Cell Lines |date=January 12, 2016 |website=iclac.org |access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>|name=|group=}}\n\n[[Cellosaurus]] also is maintaining a list of \"problematic\" cell lines.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/cellosaurus/search?input=%27problematic%20cell%20line%27\n |title= Cellosaurus search result: 757 hits for 'problematic cell line' \n |website= [[Cellosaurus]]\n |publisher= [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]]\n |access-date= 17 January 2018\n}}\nThe reference includes the list of linked pages in the search result.\n</ref>\nThe list is dynamically generated from all cell lines in the database with a comment containing the dedicated words \"Problematic cell line\".\n{{as of|2017|01|17}}, the list contains 757 entries.\n\nIf no species is given in the individual entries of the following tables, the table's species applies to both the assumed and the actual cell types.\n\nCell lines marked '''Virtual''' in the table below are known instances of contamination at the source; these cell lines became extinct or never existed.

Estimates based on screening of [[leukemia]]-[[lymphoma]] cell lines suggest that about 15% of these cell lines are not representative of what they are usually assumed to be.{{Efn|(Masters, 2002)|name=|group=}} A project is currently underway to enumerate and rename contaminated cell lines to avoid errors in research caused by misattribution.{{Efn|(Drexler et al., 2002)|name=|group=}}\n\nContaminated cell lines have been extensively used in research without knowledge of their true character. For example, most if not all research on the [[endothelium]] ECV-304 or the [[megakaryocyte]] DAMI cell lines has in reality been conducted on [[urinary bladder|bladder]] [[carcinoma]] and [[erythroleukemia]] cells, respectively. Thus, all research on endothelium- or megakaryocyte-specific functions utilizing these cell lines has turned out to be misguided, serving more of a warning example.\n\nThere are two principal ways a cell line can become contaminated: cell cultures are often exchanged between research groups; if, during handling, a sample gets contaminated and then passed on, subsequent exchanges of cells will lead to the contaminating population being established, although parts of the supposed cell line are still genuine. More serious is contamination at the source: during establishment of the original cell line, some contaminating cells are accidentally introduced into the cultures, where they in time outgrow the desired cells. The initial testing, in this case, still suggested that the cell line is genuine and novel, but in reality, it has disappeared soon after being established and ''all'' samples of such cell lines are actually the contaminant cells. It requires lengthy research to determine the precise point where cell lines have become contaminated. A mix-up rated as contamination could in reality be a simple confusion of two cell lines, but usually contamination is assumed.{{citation needed|reason=Indeed all articles I have seen about the problem do that, but a dedicated reference would be nicer. Best would be one which refers to investigations of this possibility.|date=January 2018}}\n\nAfter a cell line has been discovered to be contaminated, it is usually never again used for research demanding the specific type of cell line they are assumed to be. Most cell lines are discarded, however sometimes contaminant cells have acquired novel characteristics (e.g., by [[mutation]] or viral [[transfection]], for example the [[HeLa]] derivate Det98) and thus constitute a novel lineage after all, so are not thrown away. If a cell line is thought to be contaminated, it is usually tested for authenticity.{{Efn|The references listed below contain some papers on how common contaminates can be recognized.|name=|group=}} The widespread contamination of HeLa cells was initially recognized by [[Walter Nelson-Rees]] using simple [[Giemsa]] stain [[karyotype|karyotyping]] under a [[light microscope]]. This technique works well in recognizing HeLa because these cells have distinctive [[chromosome]] aberrations. Novel cell lines are proliferated and distributed and/or deposited at a safekeeping institution such as the [[American Type Culture Collection|ATCC]] as soon as possible after establishment, to minimize the odds that the line becomes spoiled by contamination. It is considered [[Good Laboratory Practice|good practice]] to periodically check cell lines maintained under laboratory conditions (i.e., not placed in long-term storage) for contamination with HeLa or other common contaminants, to ensure that their quality and integrity is maintained.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n== Lists of contaminated cell lines ==\n\nThis list, containing 488 cell lines, was last updated on 1 December 2016.{{Efn|An updated list can be obtained from International Cell Line Authentication Committee website.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iclac.org/wp-content/uploads/Cross-Contaminations-v8_0.pdf |title=Database of Cross-Contaminated or Misidentified Cell Lines |date=January 12, 2016 |website=iclac.org |access-date=2019-05-10}}</ref>|name=|group=}}\n\n[[Cellosaurus]] also is maintaining a list of \"problematic\" cell lines.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |url= http://web.expasy.org/cgi-bin/cellosaurus/search?input=%27problematic%20cell%20line%27\n |title= Cellosaurus search result: 757 hits for 'problematic cell line' \n |website= [[Cellosaurus]]\n |publisher= [[Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics]]\n |access-date= 17 January 2018\n}}\nThe reference includes the list of linked pages in the search result.\n</ref>\nThe list is dynamically generated from all cell lines in the database with a comment containing the dedicated words \"Problematic cell line\".\n{{as of|2017|01|17}}, the list contains 757 entries.\n\nIf no species is given in the individual entries of the following tables, the table's species applies to both the assumed and the actual cell types.\n\nCell lines marked '''Virtual''' in the table below are known instances of contamination at the source; these cell lines became extinct or never existed.

The Church uses [[spiritual use of cannabis|marijuana]] as a [[sacrament]] and promotes [[nudity]] as a demonstration of human honesty.\n\n==Theology==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}\nThe guiding rules of the church are variations on the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]]:\n* Do not hurt yourself. \n* Do not hurt anyone else.\n\nAlthough often quoting from the [[Bible]] and other scriptures, the church denies a direct connection to [[Christianity]]. It also accepts as valid sources of inspiration ancient and modern sources such as the culture of [[Sumer]], pagan holidays of the [[solstice]]s, [[Canada Day]], the [[Knights Templar]], [[Chaldea]]ns, [[Gnostic]] [[Gospel]]s and the [[Desiderata]].\n\nTheir sacrament is [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], and followers are encouraged to smoke it and use hemp products. They draw on accounts in [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] and associate the [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|Tree of Life]] with the hemp plant, additionally quoting [[Psalm]] 22:30 and [[Book of Revelation|Revelation]] 22:2,14.\n\nNudity also finds its origins in Genesis, since Adam and Eve were unclothed until they ate from the [[Tree of the knowledge of good and evil|Tree of Knowledge]] rather than the Tree of Life. However, members are enjoined to cover their heads on any official occasion or when interacting with government agents. Each person is encouraged to do so as God directs. Nudism is no longer practiced in many communities within the Church of the Universe.\n\nSince all members joining the church are simultaneously considered to be [[ordinations|ordained]] as ministers, there is theoretically no distinction made between \"clergy\" and \"ordinary members\". However, founder Walter Tucker and leading member [[Michael Baldasaro]] have partially developed a system of structured religious titles derived from [[Order of Precedence (Catholic Church)|Catholic Christianity]], such as [[reverend]], [[archbishop]], [[bishop]] and [[abbot]].\n\n==Activities==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}\nTucker founded the church at a water-filled former quarry in [[Puslinch, Ontario]] in [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington County]] between [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Guelph]] in 1969. After he leased the site for a nominal fee, he renamed it ''Clearwater Abbey''.\n\nClearwater Abbey's presence in the area was not without controversy, including allegations of noisy ceremonies on the property, the discovery nearby of human remains in 1975, the termination of its lease in 1982, and the final forcible removal of members from the property by police and sheriffs.  An attempt to relocate to a disused foundry, renamed ''Hempire Village'', in Guelph in 1994 met a similar fate.  The church is now located in north Hamilton.\n\nThe church's ritual use of cannabis and its occasional practice of nudism has attracted attention from both the media and police. Because of members' regular possession and use of cannabis as a sacrament, legal charges of criminal possession and trafficking in marijuana laid against individual members are a common occurrence.\n\nFrequent court challenges, based on charges or the exercise of political rights, have created an additional pair of intertwined activities: the Legal Self-Defence fund and the University of Universe.  Members who defend themselves or others in court are granted degrees from this non-accredited university, the level depending on the level of court involved.\n\nIn the past, both Baldasaro and Tucker have utilized [[perennial candidate|political candidacy]] for various public and party offices as a platform for espousing their religious beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{No footnotes|date=July 2010}}\n*Assembly of the Church of the Universe.

Nudism is no longer practiced in many communities within the Church of the Universe.\n\nSince all members joining the church are simultaneously considered to be [[ordinations|ordained]] as ministers, there is theoretically no distinction made between \"clergy\" and \"ordinary members\". However, founder Walter Tucker and leading member [[Michael Baldasaro]] have partially developed a system of structured religious titles derived from [[Order of Precedence (Catholic Church)|Catholic Christianity]], such as [[reverend]], [[archbishop]], [[bishop]] and [[abbot]].\n\n==Activities==\n{{Refimprove section|date=July 2009}}\nTucker founded the church at a water-filled former quarry in [[Puslinch, Ontario]] in [[Wellington County, Ontario|Wellington County]] between [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]] and [[Guelph]] in 1969. After he leased the site for a nominal fee, he renamed it ''Clearwater Abbey''.\n\nClearwater Abbey's presence in the area was not without controversy, including allegations of noisy ceremonies on the property, the discovery nearby of human remains in 1975, the termination of its lease in 1982, and the final forcible removal of members from the property by police and sheriffs.  An attempt to relocate to a disused foundry, renamed ''Hempire Village'', in Guelph in 1994 met a similar fate.  The church is now located in north Hamilton.\n\nThe church's ritual use of cannabis and its occasional practice of nudism has attracted attention from both the media and police. Because of members regular possession and use of cannabis as a sacrament, legal charges of criminal possession and trafficking in marijuana laid against individual members are a common occurrence.\n\nFrequent court challenges, based on charges or the exercise of political rights, have created an additional pair of intertwined activities: the Legal Self-Defence fund and the University of Universe.  Members who defend themselves or others in court are granted degrees from this non-accredited university, the level depending on the level of court involved.\n\nIn the past, both Baldasaro and Tucker have utilized [[perennial candidate|political candidacy]] for various public and party offices as a platform for espousing their religious beliefs.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n{{No footnotes|date=July 2010}}\n*Assembly of the Church of the Universe.

The theme park is divided into four sections that celebrate [[Christmas]], [[Halloween]], [[Thanksgiving]] and the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] with rides, live entertainment, games, and attractions.\n\nHoliday World contains three [[wooden roller coaster]]s: [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]], [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]], and [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]], as well as [[Thunderbird (Holiday World)|Thunderbird]] (a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] launched [[Wing Coaster]]) and [[The Howler]]. The safari-themed water park includes the world's two longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coasters]]: [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] and Guinness World Record Holder [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]], numerous family raft rides and [[water slide]]s, two [[wave pool]]s, junior-sized wave pool, two children's-sized water slide areas, a [[lazy river]], two family \"tipping bucket\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:FreedomTrain.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Freedom Train, previously called the Santa Claus Land Railroad, operated from 1946 to 2012]]\n\n===Santa Claus Land===\n\n====Construction====\nPlans for what would become '''Santa Claus Land''', and later '''Holiday World & Splashin' Safari''', were first conceived as a retirement project by Louis J. Koch, a retired industrialist from [[Evansville, Indiana]]. In 1941, Koch visited the town of [[Santa Claus, Indiana]]. A family man and father of nine children, it bothered him that children traveled to the town only to be disappointed when they discovered [[Santa Claus]] was not there. In response, Koch developed the idea for a park where children could have fun and visit Santa year-round. Although initial construction plans were delayed by [[World War II]], construction of Santa Claus Land eventually began on August 4, 1945.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|title=Park History|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/park-history-santa-claus-land-holiday-world|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/timeline-santa-claus-land-holiday-world-splashin-safari|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> At this time, [[Indiana]] had only one [[amusement park]] which was [[Indiana Beach]] (at the time called Ideal Beach) that had opened in 1926, 20 years before Santa Claus Land opened.\n\n====Opening to 1954====\nSanta Claus Land opened on August 3, 1946. At no cost, the park offered a Santa, a toy shop, toy displays, a restaurant and themed children's rides, one of which was The Freedom Train. After overcoming doubts about the park's ability for success, Louis Koch's son, [[William A. Koch|William A. \"Bill\" Koch, Sr.]], took over as head of Santa Claus Land. In the following years, Bill Koch continued to add to the park, including the first Jeep-Go-Round ever manufactured, a new restaurant and a deer farm which was eventually home to fourteen [[Fallow deer|European white fallow deer]].<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"deer\">{{cite web|title=Holiblog|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3664|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029220227/http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3664|archive-date=October 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Reagan1955.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Future President Ronald Reagan visited in 1955]]\n\n====1955 to 1975====\n[[File:SantaClausLand Aerial.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An aerial view of Santa Claus Land taken around 1957]]\nBeginning in 1955, Santa Claus Land charged admission for the first time; adults were charged 50 cents while children continued to be admitted for free. Despite the new cost of admission, attendance continued to grow with the park. The Pleasureland ride section, which exists today as Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch, debuted in 1955. In the early 1970s, additional children's rides, including Dasher's Seahorses, Comet's Rockets, Blitzen's Airplanes, and Prancer's Merry-Go-Round, were added to this section. From 1959 to 1961, the first live entertainment, the Willie Bartley [[waterskiing|Water Ski]] Thrill Show, performed on Lake Rudolph each summer. A Santa Claus Choir composed of local children also performed at the park in 1970 and 1971.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nIn 1960, Bill Koch married Patricia \"Pat\" Yellig, the daughter of Jim Yellig, the park's Santa Claus. Bill and Pat Koch would have five children: Will, Kristi, Daniel, Philip, and Natalie.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n====1976 to 1983====\nIn 1976, Santa Claus Land shifted its focus, along with its entrance, which was moved from [[Indiana State Road 162|State Road 162]] to its present location on [[Indiana State Road 245|State Road 245]]. The park began to focus on the entire family, rather than just children. The park added nine new rides by 1984, eight of which they hoped would appeal to older children and adults alike. Eagle's Flight, Rough Riders, Roundhouse, Virginia Reel, Scarecrow Scrambler, Lewis & Clark Trail, Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay were all targeted towards families, while Dancer's Thunder Bumpers Junior was built for children who weren't quite ready for the larger version of the ride.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\n===Holiday World===\n[[File:FrightfulFalls.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An early photo of Frightful Falls showing what it looked like prior to the construction of [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]] in this area]]\n\n====1984 to 1992====\nBy 1984, the Koch Family had realized the theming possibilities beyond [[Christmas]]. Santa Claus Land soon saw the first major expansion in park history with the addition of a [[Halloween]] section and a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] section. With the inclusion of more than just Christmas, '''Santa Claus Land''' formally changed its name to '''Holiday World'''. In the following years, Frightful Falls and Banshee were added to the Halloween section, Raging Rapids was added to the Fourth of July section in 1990, and Kringle's Kaf\u00e9 restaurant was built in the Christmas section.<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nIt was also during this time period that Holiday World saw a change in leadership. Will Koch, the eldest of Bill Koch's children, took over as President of the park. Another of Bill Koch's children, Daniel \"Dan\" Koch, became chairman of the board.<ref name=\"patriarch\">{{cite web|title=Holiday World's Patriarch|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-worlds-patriarch-leaves-legacy|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Holiday World & Splashin' Safari===\n[[File:TheRaven.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An early photo of The Raven.

In its first year of operation, Splashin' Safari operated with Congo River, Crocodile Isle, AmaZOOM and Bamboo Chute. The Wave was added the following year.\n\nThe park added the first of its three [[wooden roller coaster]]s in 1995 with [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]], built by [[Custom Coasters International]]. The Raven was named \"Ride of the Year\" and was voted as the world's second best wooden roller coaster. In 2000, The Raven was ranked as the #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by [[Amusement Today]] magazine. It held the top spot for a total of four years.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> As of the 2011 awards, The Raven has remained ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world.<ref name=\"gta\">{{cite web|title=2011 Golden Ticket Awards |url=http://www.goldenticketawards.com/pdfs/2011_golden_ticket_section.pdf |publisher=Amusement Today |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312025513/http://www.goldenticketawards.com/pdfs/2011_golden_ticket_section.pdf |archivedate=March 12, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOver the next four years, the park made only two additions. The first was the addition of Monsoon Lagoon in Splashin' Safari. The second was the replacement of Firecracker with Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area featuring Holidog's Treehouse, The Howler, Doggone Trail and Magic Waters.\n\n[[File:Zinga.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Zinga]]\n\nIn 2000, Custom Coasters International added another wooden roller coaster. [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]], based on [[Washington Irving]]'s \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\", was opened immediately adjacent to The Raven and is taller, longer, and faster than The Raven. The Legend's ranking reached its peak in 2002, when it was voted the fourth best wooden roller coaster in the world.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Much like The Raven, The Legend continues to be ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world, as of the 2011 awards.<ref name=\"gta\" /> In 2000, the park also began offering its guests free unlimited soft drinks, a service which brought international attention to the park.<ref name=\"drinks\">{{cite web|title=Free Drinks Wins Award|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-worlds-free-drinks-wins-international-award|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> Holiday World was the first park in the world to offer this service to its guests.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nFor the next five years, the park's additions grew steadily. In 2002, ZOOMbabwe, the world's largest enclosed water slide, was added to Splashin' Safari.<ref name=\"zoombabwe\">{{cite web|title=ZOOMbabwe|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rides/zoombabwe|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> In 2003, Splashin' Safari added Zinga on top of The Legend's spiral drop, a [[ProSlide Tornado]], while Holiday World replaced Banshee with Hallowswings and the Hall of Famous Americans wax museum with Liberty Launch. In 2004, the park continued to add onto the water park, adding Jungle Racer and Jungle Jets. Bahari Wave Pool was added in 2005, which marked the beginning of an expansion project that would double the size of Splashin' Safari.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nHoliday World & Splashin' Safari received its most sought after award in 2004, when it earned the [[Applause Award]] from the [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]]. To win the award, awarded every two years, a park must show \"foresight, originality and creativity, plus sound business development and profitability.\" With an attendance of 883,000 that year, Holiday World was the smallest park to ever receive the award.<ref name=\"applause\">{{cite web|title=IAAPA Applause Award|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-world-wins-international-applause-award|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====2006 to 2013====\n\nThe 2006 season marked the 60th anniversary of Holiday World. The park marked it by adding a brand new section: [[Thanksgiving]]. To complement the section, the park added two new rides. The first was [[Gobbler Getaway]], a [[Sally Corporation]] interactive [[dark ride]]. The anchor attraction was the park's third wooden roller coaster, [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]], built by [[The Gravity Group]], successors of Custom Coasters International. The addition of The Voyage gained the park national attention once again, as the roller coaster claimed the record for most [[air-time]] of any wooden roller coaster at 24.2 seconds.<ref name=\"voyage\">{{cite web|title=Voyage Brings Spotlight to Holiday World|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/voyage-brings-national-spotlight|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> It is also the second longest wooden roller coaster in the world behind only [[The Beast (roller coaster)|The Beast]] at [[Kings Island]]. In its first year of operation, The Voyage was awarded the title of \"Best New Ride\" and #2 wooden roller coaster in the world. From 2007 to 2011, The Voyage was awarded the title of #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by the readers of Amusement Today magazine.<ref name=\"gta\" /> Also added in 2006 was Bahari River in Splashin' Safari. It was named the \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" by Amusement Today magazine.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"bahari\">{{cite web|title=Best New Rides|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-world-receives-best-new-ride|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOver the next three years, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari opened several new additions. Bakuli and Kima Bay were added to Splashin' Safari, Turkey Whirl and Plymouth Rock Caf\u00e9 were added to the Thanksgiving section, the Star Spangled Carousel replaced Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay in the Fourth of July section, and Reindeer Games replaced Kids Castle in the Christmas section. In 2009, Holiday World continued to break records by opening the world's tallest water ride, Pilgrims Plunge, in the Thanksgiving section of the park. Pilgrims Plunge deviated from the standard of using a sloped lift hill, instead opting for an open-air elevator system that takes riders to a height of {{Convert|135|ft}} before dropping them at a forty-five degree angle.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Pilgrims Plunge was renamed to Giraffica in 2013 when the boundaries between the Thanksgiving section and the water park were slightly altered.<ref name=\"2013 Expansion\">{{cite web|title=2013 Expansion|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/park-invests-65-million-2013-season|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSplashin' Safari broke another record in 2010, when [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] was opened. When Wildebeest opened, it was the world's longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coaster]] at {{Convert|1710|ft}} long. It was also among the first water coasters to use [[linear induction motors]], rather than water jets or [[conveyor belts]], to propel riders up hills. Wildebeest was named \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, as well as \"Best Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, 2011 and 2012.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"wildebeest\">{{cite web|title=Wildebeest|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rides/wildebeest|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> The park broke its own record just two years later, in 2012, when [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]] opened.

Several members of the Koch family later expressed interest into reviving the park in 2012, but later backed out of the deal. This park would eventually reopen under different management in 2014.\n\nThe park suffered a sudden loss in June 2010 when President and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] Will Koch died while swimming at his home. Although the [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]] coroner listed the official cause of death as drowning, family and park officials believe Koch's [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]] played a factor in his death. Soon after his death, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari named Will's younger brother Dan as the park's new President.<ref name=\"death\">{{cite web|title=Will Koch Drowned|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2010/jun/17/holiday-worlds-will-koch-drowned-says-coroner/|publisher=Evansville Courier & Press|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> Dan Koch served as the park's President until late 2012, shortly after which the [[board of directors]] announced Matt Eckert as the new President, launching a bitter fight within the family for control of the park and its assets. Matt Eckert was previously one of the parks two [[general manager]]s. Eckert is the first park President not related to the Koch family. They also ousted Pat Koch, Will Sr.'s widow, from any involvement the park. She had been a fixture there for decades.<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2013/10/03/appeals-court-sides-with-widow-in-holiday-world-ownership-dispute/2915659/</ref>\n\nWill Koch's widow Lori and their three children won primary ownership in the park after an ugly court battle and its parent company, Koch Development Corporation. Dan Koch, along with his sister Natalie, would go on in 2014 to form Koch Family Parks and buy [[Alabama Splash Adventure]], a previously troubled theme park in [[Bessemer, Alabama]].<ref name=\"eckert\">{{cite web|title=Holiday World Names New President|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2013/jan/08/no-headline---eckert/|publisher=Evansville Courier & Press|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the park has replaced some of its older rides with newer rides. In Holiday World, Blitzen's Airplanes was replaced with Rudolph's Round-Up in 2011 and in 2012 Paul Revere's Midnight Ride was replaced with Sparkler, a {{convert|65|ft}} tall [[Zamperla]] Vertical Swing ride. Due to limited vertical clearance for Sparkler, the park decided to relocate Star Spangled Carousel to the former location of Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and to place Sparkler in the carousel's place.<ref name=\"swing\">{{cite web|title=Vertical Swing|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3654|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122025246/http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3654|archivedate=November 22, 2011|df=}}</ref> The following year, Holiday World removed part of Holidog's Treehouse to make room for a new [[teacups|tea cup]] ride called Kitty's Tea Party.

This is B&M's first launched coaster ([[The Incredible Hulk (roller coaster)|The Incredible Hulk Coaster]] at [[Universal's Islands of Adventure]]'s launch was created by Universal, not B&M).

Each of the sections features rides, games, food and other attractions that follow the theme of that section's respective holiday. The music that plays over the loud speakers in each section is also themed to that section's respective holiday; guests will often notice the music change as they enter a different section. Splashin' Safari, which is connected to the theme park via entrances in the Halloween and Thanksgiving sections, takes the general theme of a safari.\n\n===Christmas===\nUpon entering Holiday World, guests immediately enter the Christmas section. The Christmas section is the oldest section of Holiday World, dating back to 1946. It was also the only themed area of the park until 1984. Although devoid of any major rides, there is a small sub-section called Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch which is home to several small children's rides. Notable landmarks in this section include a [[Santa Claus]] statue, a [[Christmas tree]], a [[nativity scene]] and the Applause [[fountain]], which was added after the park was awarded the [[IAAPA]] Applause Award in 2004. The Christmas section of the park also includes one of the park's two air-conditioned restaurants: Kringle's Kaf\u00e9, which serves standard theme park fare such as pizza, burgers and ice cream. Since the park's opening in 1946, Santa Claus has been available daily throughout the season to chat with children.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Comet's Rockets\n|style=white-space:nowrap|1970s\n| Children's rocket ride\n|-\n| Dasher's Seahorses\n| 1970s\n| Children's seahorse ride\n|-\n| Prancer's Merry-Go-Round\n| 1970s\n| Children's [[carousel]]\n|-\n| Reindeer Games\n| 2008\n| Three-story family [[drop tower (ride)|drop ride]]\n|-\n| Rudolph's Round-Up\n| 2011\n| Children's sleigh ride\n|-\n|Dancer's Fish\n|1970s\n|Fish-go-round ([[Bulgy the Whale]])\n|-\n|}\n\n===Halloween===\nThe Halloween section was one of two new holidays added in 1984. Two of the three wooden roller coasters in the park are located here: [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]] and [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]]. The area also has a Goblin Burgers restaurant, which resembles a witch's house, the Frightful Falls log flume that intertwines with The Legend, and the main entrance to Splashin' Safari water park. Apart from the architecture, guests will hear the school bell from The Legend's station ringing ominously throughout the section. It introduced '''Kitty Claws''' as its mascot in 2012.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Scarecrow Scrambler\n| 1976\n| [[Eli Bridge Company]]\n| Classic [[twist (ride)|scrambler ride]]\n|-\n| Frightful Falls\n| 1984\n|\n| [[log flume (attraction)|Log flume]]\n|-\n| [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]]\n| 1995\n| [[Custom Coasters International]]\n| [[Wooden roller coaster]] themed after [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s poem \"[[The Raven]]\"\n|-\n| [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]]\n| 2000\n| [[Custom Coasters International]]\n| [[Wooden roller coaster]] themed after [[Washington Irving]]'s short story \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\"\n|-\n| HallowSwings\n| 2003\n| [[Zamperla]]\n| Custom-made [[Zamperla]] flying carousel [[Chair-O-Planes|swing ride]]\n|-\n|}\n\n===Fourth of July===\nThe Fourth of July section was the second of the two holidays that were added in 1984. It introduced '''George the Eagle''' as its mascot. This area features more attractions than any of the four sections in the theme park. Landmarks in this section include the Hoosier Celebration Theater, where many live shows are performed; the Good Old Days Picnic Grove, where numerous shelter houses may be rented out for company picnics; and The Alamo restaurant, which serves traditional Mexican food. The Fourth of July section is also home to a sub-section called Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area which is completely encircled by Holidog Express. Keeping with the Fourth of July theme, there is also a monument with several [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] located right across from The Alamo restaurant in the center of the section.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Eagles Flight\n| 1976\n| [[Flying Scooters|Flying Scooter]]\n|-\n| Rough Riders\n| 1976\n| [[Bumper car]]s themed after former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Rough Riders]]\n|-\n| Lewis & Clark Trail\n| 1978\n| Gould Manufacturing [[Ford Model T|Tin Lizzie]] antique car ride\n|-\n| Tippecanoes\n| 1988\n| Children's [[canoe]] ride; originally called Indian River Canoes, but renamed to Tippecanoes in 2016\n|-\n| Raging Rapids in Boulder Canyon\n| 1990\n| [[River rapids ride]]\n|-\n| Liberty Launch\n| 2003\n| Seven-story [[S&S Worldwide|S&S]] [[Double Shot (ride)|Double Shot]]\n|-\n| Revolution\n| 2005\n| Dartron Zero Gravity [[round up (ride)|Round Up]] ride\n|-\n| Star Spangled Carousel\n| 2008\n| [[Carousel]]\n|-\n| Holidog Express\n| 2013\n| [[ridable miniature railway|Ridable miniature train]] ride\n|-\n| Firecracker\n| 2017\n| Restored Calypso ride; named after the park's now-defunct steel coaster that was replaced by Holidog's Funtown in 1997\n|}\n\n====Holidog's FunTown====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Holidog's Treehouse\n| 1999\n|\n| Three-story play structure; the original was replaced with a new wheelchair accessible play structure in 2017\n|-\n| Just for Pups\n| 1999\n|\n| Smaller version of Holidog's Treehouse that is designed for small children\n|-\n| [[The Howler]]\n| 1999\n| [[Zamperla]]\n| Family [[steel roller coaster]]\n|-\n| Doggone Trail\n| 1999\n|\n| Children's jeep ride\n|-\n| Magic Waters\n| 1999\n|\n| Spray park area\n|-\n| Kitty's Tea Party\n| 2013\n| Zamperla\n| Classic [[teacups|tea cup]] ride\n|}\n\n===Thanksgiving===\nThe Thanksgiving section is the newest section of the park, added in 2006 to commemorate Holiday World's 60th anniversary. The anchor attraction of this section is [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]] which wraps around parts of the [[Midway (fair)|midway]]; guests walk under The Voyage 's [[brake run]] upon entering the section through Fourth of July. In the back of the Thanksgiving section is [[Thunderbird (Holiday World)|Thunderbird]], the wing coaster, and a secondary entrance to Splashin' Safari. In addition to The Voyage and Thunderbird, the Thanksgiving section includes the second of the park's two air-conditioned restaurants: Plymouth Rock Caf\u00e9, which serves typical Thanksgiving food such as [[Domesticated turkey#Turkeys as food|turkey]], [[Standing rib roast|prime rib]], [[Stove Top stuffing|stuffing]], [[green bean]]s and [[bread roll]]s.

Among those additions are the world's two longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coasters]]: [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] and [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]], which are also, respectively, the third and first most expensive additions ever made to the park.

Holiday World has hosted this event three times. Holiday World & Splashin' Safari was the first ever park to host the event in 2000. Holiday World also hosted the awards in 2006 and 2011. The awards ceremony has been hosted in Holiday Theater in the Christmas section.<ref name=\"gta\" />\n* '''Play Day:'''&nbsp;&ndash; Every year since 1993, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari has hosted thousands of children with [[mental disorder|mental]] and [[physical disability|physical]] disabilities for an event called \"Play Day\". Play Day is for invited guests of the [[Easter Seals (U.S.)|Easter Seals Rehabilitation Center of Southwestern Indiana]]. The admission price for Play Day is $9, with all proceeds being donated to the Easter Seals. As of 2011, Holiday World has raised over $257,000 for the Easter Seals Rehabilitation Center.<ref>{{cite web|title=Play Day|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-world-hosts-2500-children-disabilities|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 15, 2011}}</ref>\n* '''Walk to Cure Diabetes:'''&nbsp;&ndash; Every year since 2006, Holiday World has hosted thousands of walkers for the \"Holiday World Walk to Cure Diabetes\", which is a walk to raise money for the [[JDRF (formerly known as the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation)|Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF)]].

The event features exclusive ride time (ERT) on the park's three wooden roller coasters, plus a select few other rides, both before park opening and after park closing. The event, which was first known as Stark Raven Mad, was temporarily discontinued in 2003 following a death during the event (See: [[Holiday World & Splashin' Safari#Incidents|Incidents]]). In 2006, the event returned after being renamed HoliWood Nights. The park embraces HoliWood's pun on [[Hollywood]] by naming each year's event as a play on the title of a movie. The theme of the 2013 event is \"Dig\", which is a play on the 1988 movie [[Big (film)|Big]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HoliWood Nights|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/clubs|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref>\n* '''Rock the World:'''&nbsp;&ndash; Since 2012, Holiday World has hosted a [[Christian music festival]] called Rock the World on a select Saturday in August. Throughout the day, regional [[Contemporary Christian music|contemporary Christian]] bands perform in the Hoosier Celebration Theater.

The main stage features a number of nationally known Christian artists and bands who perform well past normal closing hours. (The main stage acts in 2012 were [[Jeremy Camp]], [[Tenth Avenue North]], [[BarlowGirl]] and Hearts of Saints).<ref>{{cite web|title=Rock the World|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rocktheworld|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\n* '''Happy Halloween Weekends:'''&nbsp;&ndash; Since 2012, Holiday World has remained open in October to hold an event called Happy Halloween Weekends. For the last two weekends in September plus the four weekends in October, the park holds family-friendly, Halloween-themed activities. Some of these seasonal attractions include two [[corn maze]]s, [[hayride]]s, a 3-D walk-through attraction similar to a family-friendly [[haunted house]] and a family activity area geared towards children located in the Good Ol' Days Picnic Grove. The park transforms itself into a solely Halloween-themed park, with Halloween decorations, Halloween-themed shows and special Halloween-themed food items. These attractions are hosted in addition to the park's normal offerings of rides, games and food.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Halloween Weekends|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/events/happy-halloween-weekends|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2004, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari was presented the [[Applause Award]]. To receive this honor, a park must show \"foresight, originality and creativity, plus sound business development and profitability.\" With an attendance of 883,000 that year, Holiday World was the smallest park to ever receive the award. The park celebrated by installing a large replica of the award's [[trophy]] as well as [[commemorative plaque]]s naming other recipients of the award as part of a fountain in the Christmas section.<ref name=\"applause\" />\n\nHoliday World & Splashin' Safari has also received numerous [[Golden Ticket Awards]], which are presented by [[Amusement Today]] magazine to the best of the best in the amusement park industry.

The victim was visiting the park to attend \"Stark Raven Mad 2003\", an event hosting roller coaster enthusiasts from around the country. At approximately 8:00 pm, the victim and her fianc\u00e9 boarded The Raven in the last row of the train. Following a safety check of her lap bar and seat belt by a ride operator, the train left the station. Multiple witnesses reported that they saw her \"virtually standing up\" during the ride's initial and subsequent drops. During the ride's {{convert|69|ft}} drop, also called the fifth drop, she was ejected from the car and onto the tracks. When the train returned to the station, the victim's fianc\u00e9, ride operators and a passenger who was a doctor ran back along the tracks, at which point they found her lying under the structure of the roller coaster at the fifth drop. The doctor, aided by park medical personnel, began [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] until an ambulance arrived. The victim was pronounced dead en route to the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prosecutor's Report|url=http://www.masstort.org/Downloads/HW/finalpros.pdf|publisher=Spencer County Prosecutor's Office|accessdate=November 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004213338/http://www.masstort.org/Downloads/HW/finalpros.pdf|archive-date=October 4, 2011|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n:An investigation following the accident showed that the safety restraints were working properly and that there were no mechanical deficiencies on the roller coaster.

The man was a supervisor for the park's grounds department. The employee was working alone, mowing an area with some inclines outside the east side of the park when the incident occurred, though the park refused to speculate on exactly what might have happened. The man was found by another employee, who was then able to help lift the lawn mower off the victim with the help of other employees.

At 6:25 pm, the pump, which was turned off at the time, was turned back on. The pump surged, forcing a stronger than usual concentration of [[Sodium hypochlorite|liquid bleach]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] into the water. Twenty-four people, including park staff and medical personnel, complained of troubled breathing and [[nausea]]. They were given [[oxygen]] at the park before being transported to [[Jasper, Indiana|Jasper]] Memorial Hospital for treatment. All were treated and released that evening.

The theme park is divided into four sections that celebrate [[Christmas]], [[Halloween]], [[Thanksgiving]] and the [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] with rides, live entertainment, games, and attractions.\n\nHoliday World contains three [[wooden roller coaster]]s: [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]], [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]], and [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]], as well as [[Thunderbird (Holiday World)|Thunderbird]] (a [[Bolliger & Mabillard]] launched [[Wing Coaster]]) and [[The Howler]]. The safari-themed water park includes the world's two longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coasters]]: [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] and Guinness World Record Holder [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]], numerous family raft rides and [[water slide]]s, two [[wave pool]]s, junior-sized wave pool, two children's-sized water slide areas, a [[lazy river]], two family \"tipping bucket\".\n\n==History==\n[[File:FreedomTrain.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The Freedom Train, previously called the Santa Claus Land Railroad, operated from 1946 to 2012]]\n\n===Santa Claus Land===\n\n====Construction====\nPlans for what would become '''Santa Claus Land''', and later '''Holiday World & Splashin' Safari''', were first conceived as a retirement project by Louis J. Koch, a retired industrialist from [[Evansville, Indiana]]. In 1941, Koch visited the town of [[Santa Claus, Indiana]]. A family man and father of nine children, it bothered him that children traveled to the town only to be disappointed when they discovered [[Santa Claus]] was not there. In response, Koch developed the idea for a park where children could have fun and visit Santa year-round. Although initial construction plans were delayed by [[World War II]], construction of Santa Claus Land eventually began on August 4, 1945.<ref name=\"history\">{{cite web|title=Park History|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/park-history-santa-claus-land-holiday-world|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"timeline\">{{cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/timeline-santa-claus-land-holiday-world-splashin-safari|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> At this time, [[Indiana]] had only one [[amusement park]] which was [[Indiana Beach]] (at the time called Ideal Beach) that had opened in 1926, 20 years before Santa Claus Land opened.\n\n====Opening to 1954====\nSanta Claus Land opened on August 3, 1946. At no cost, the park offered a Santa, a toy shop, toy displays, a restaurant and themed children's rides, one of which was The Freedom Train. After overcoming doubts about the park's ability for success, Louis Koch's son, [[William A. Koch|William A. \"Bill\" Koch, Sr.]], took over as head of Santa Claus Land. In the following years, Bill Koch continued to add to the park, including the first Jeep-Go-Round ever manufactured, a new restaurant and a deer farm which was eventually home to fourteen [[Fallow deer|European white fallow deer]].<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"deer\">{{cite web|title=Holiblog|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3664|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029220227/http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3664|archive-date=October 29, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Reagan1955.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Future President Ronald Reagan visited in 1955]]\n\n====1955 to 1975====\n[[File:SantaClausLand Aerial.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An aerial view of Santa Claus Land taken around 1957]]\nBeginning in 1955, Santa Claus Land charged admission for the first time; adults were charged 50 cents while children continued to be admitted for free. Despite the new cost of admission, attendance continued to grow with the park. The Pleasureland ride section, which exists today as Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch, debuted in 1955. In the early 1970s, additional children's rides, including Dasher's Seahorses, Comet's Rockets, Blitzen's Airplanes, and Prancer's Merry-Go-Round, were added to this section. From 1959 to 1961, the first live entertainment, the Willie Bartley [[waterskiing|Water Ski]] Thrill Show, performed on Lake Rudolph each summer. A Santa Claus Choir composed of local children also performed at the park in 1970 and 1971.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nIn 1960, Bill Koch married Patricia \"Pat\" Yellig, the daughter of Jim Yellig, the park's Santa Claus. Bill and Pat Koch would have five children: Will, Kristi, Daniel, Philip, and Natalie.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\n====1976 to 1983====\nIn 1976, Santa Claus Land shifted its focus, along with its entrance, which was moved from [[Indiana State Road 162|State Road 162]] to its present location on [[Indiana State Road 245|State Road 245]]. The park began to focus on the entire family, rather than just children. The park added nine new rides by 1984, eight of which they hoped would appeal to older children and adults alike. Eagle's Flight, Rough Riders, Roundhouse, Virginia Reel, Scarecrow Scrambler, Lewis & Clark Trail, Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay were all targeted towards families, while Dancer's Thunder Bumpers Junior was built for children who weren't quite ready for the larger version of the ride.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\n===Holiday World===\n[[File:FrightfulFalls.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An early photo of Frightful Falls showing what it looked like prior to the construction of [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]] in this area]]\n\n====1984 to 1992====\nBy 1984, the Koch Family had realized the theming possibilities beyond [[Christmas]]. Santa Claus Land soon saw the first major expansion in park history with the addition of a [[Halloween]] section and a [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] section. With the inclusion of more than just Christmas, '''Santa Claus Land''' formally changed its name to '''Holiday World'''. In the following years, Frightful Falls and Banshee were added to the Halloween section, Raging Rapids was added to the Fourth of July section in 1990, and Kringle's Kaf\u00e9 restaurant was built in the Christmas section.<ref name=\"history\" /><ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nIt was also during this time period that Holiday World saw a change in leadership. Will Koch, the eldest of Bill Koch's children, took over as President of the park. Another of Bill Koch's children, Daniel \"Dan\" Koch, became chairman of the board.<ref name=\"patriarch\">{{cite web|title=Holiday World's Patriarch|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-worlds-patriarch-leaves-legacy|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Holiday World & Splashin' Safari===\n[[File:TheRaven.jpg|thumb|200px|left|An early photo of The Raven. Bill Koch Sr. is on the left; Will Koch is on the right]]\n\n====1993 to 2005====\nThe addition of '''Splashin' Safari''' in 1993 welcomed a new era for the theme park. In its first year of operation, Splashin' Safari operated with Congo River, Crocodile Isle, AmaZOOM and Bamboo Chute. The Wave was added the following year.\n\nThe park added the first of its three [[wooden roller coaster]]s in 1995 with [[The Raven (roller coaster)|The Raven]], built by [[Custom Coasters International]]. The Raven was named \"Ride of the Year\" and was voted as the world's second best wooden roller coaster. In 2000, The Raven was ranked as the #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by [[Amusement Today]] magazine. It held the top spot for a total of four years.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> As of the 2011 awards, The Raven has remained ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world.<ref name=\"gta\">{{cite web|title=2011 Golden Ticket Awards |url=http://www.goldenticketawards.com/pdfs/2011_golden_ticket_section.pdf |publisher=Amusement Today |accessdate=November 7, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312025513/http://www.goldenticketawards.com/pdfs/2011_golden_ticket_section.pdf |archivedate=March 12, 2012 |df= }}</ref>\n\nOver the next four years, the park made only two additions. The first was the addition of Monsoon Lagoon in Splashin' Safari. The second was the replacement of Firecracker with Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area featuring Holidog's Treehouse, The Howler, Doggone Trail and Magic Waters.\n\n[[File:Zinga.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Zinga]]\n\nIn 2000, Custom Coasters International added another wooden roller coaster. [[The Legend (roller coaster)|The Legend]], based on [[Washington Irving]]'s \"[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]\", was opened immediately adjacent to The Raven and is taller, longer, and faster than The Raven. The Legend's ranking reached its peak in 2002, when it was voted the fourth best wooden roller coaster in the world.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Much like The Raven, The Legend continues to be ranked among the top twenty wooden roller coasters in the world, as of the 2011 awards.<ref name=\"gta\" /> In 2000, the park also began offering its guests free unlimited soft drinks, a service which brought international attention to the park.<ref name=\"drinks\">{{cite web|title=Free Drinks Wins Award|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-worlds-free-drinks-wins-international-award|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> Holiday World was the first park in the world to offer this service to its guests.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nFor the next five years, the park's additions grew steadily. In 2002, ZOOMbabwe, the world's largest enclosed water slide, was added to Splashin' Safari.<ref name=\"zoombabwe\">{{cite web|title=ZOOMbabwe|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rides/zoombabwe|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> In 2003, Splashin' Safari added Zinga on top of The Legend's spiral drop, a [[ProSlide Tornado]], while Holiday World replaced Banshee with Hallowswings and the Hall of Famous Americans wax museum with Liberty Launch. In 2004, the park continued to add onto the water park, adding Jungle Racer and Jungle Jets. Bahari Wave Pool was added in 2005, which marked the beginning of an expansion project that would double the size of Splashin' Safari.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\nHoliday World & Splashin' Safari received its most sought after award in 2004, when it earned the [[Applause Award]] from the [[International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions]]. To win the award, awarded every two years, a park must show \"foresight, originality and creativity, plus sound business development and profitability.\" With an attendance of 883,000 that year, Holiday World was the smallest park to ever receive the award.<ref name=\"applause\">{{cite web|title=IAAPA Applause Award|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-world-wins-international-applause-award|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====2006 to 2013====\n\nThe 2006 season marked the 60th anniversary of Holiday World. The park marked it by adding a brand new section: [[Thanksgiving]]. To complement the section, the park added two new rides. The first was [[Gobbler Getaway]], a [[Sally Corporation]] interactive [[dark ride]]. The anchor attraction was the park's third wooden roller coaster, [[The Voyage (roller coaster)|The Voyage]], built by [[The Gravity Group]], successors of Custom Coasters International. The addition of The Voyage gained the park national attention once again, as the roller coaster claimed the record for most [[air-time]] of any wooden roller coaster at 24.2 seconds.<ref name=\"voyage\">{{cite web|title=Voyage Brings Spotlight to Holiday World|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/voyage-brings-national-spotlight|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> It is also the second longest wooden roller coaster in the world behind only [[The Beast (roller coaster)|The Beast]] at [[Kings Island]]. In its first year of operation, The Voyage was awarded the title of \"Best New Ride\" and #2 wooden roller coaster in the world. From 2007 to 2011, The Voyage was awarded the title of #1 wooden roller coaster in the world by the readers of Amusement Today magazine.<ref name=\"gta\" /> Also added in 2006 was Bahari River in Splashin' Safari. It was named the \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" by Amusement Today magazine.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"bahari\">{{cite web|title=Best New Rides|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/holiday-world-receives-best-new-ride|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOver the next three years, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari opened several new additions. Bakuli and Kima Bay were added to Splashin' Safari, Turkey Whirl and Plymouth Rock Caf\u00e9 were added to the Thanksgiving section, the Star Spangled Carousel replaced Thunder Bumpers on Chesapeake Bay in the Fourth of July section, and Reindeer Games replaced Kids Castle in the Christmas section. In 2009, Holiday World continued to break records by opening the world's tallest water ride, Pilgrims Plunge, in the Thanksgiving section of the park. Pilgrims Plunge deviated from the standard of using a sloped lift hill, instead opting for an open-air elevator system that takes riders to a height of {{Convert|135|ft}} before dropping them at a forty-five degree angle.<ref name=\"timeline\" /> Pilgrims Plunge was renamed to Giraffica in 2013 when the boundaries between the Thanksgiving section and the water park were slightly altered.<ref name=\"2013 Expansion\">{{cite web|title=2013 Expansion|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/news/park-invests-65-million-2013-season|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nSplashin' Safari broke another record in 2010, when [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] was opened. When Wildebeest opened, it was the world's longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coaster]] at {{Convert|1710|ft}} long. It was also among the first water coasters to use [[linear induction motors]], rather than water jets or [[conveyor belts]], to propel riders up hills. Wildebeest was named \"Best New Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, as well as \"Best Waterpark Ride\" in 2010, 2011 and 2012.<ref name=\"timeline\" /><ref name=\"wildebeest\">{{cite web|title=Wildebeest|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rides/wildebeest|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> The park broke its own record just two years later, in 2012, when [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]] opened. Mammoth, which was the most expensive ride added to the park until the addition of Thunderbird, is {{Convert|1763|ft}} long, making it the longest water coaster in the world.<ref name=\"mammoth\">{{cite web|title=Mammoth|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rides/mammoth|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2010, Holiday World's rival park, [[Kentucky Kingdom]] in Louisville, Kentucky, announced that it would be closing permanently and ending operations after park operator Six Flags could not reach a lease agreement for the property. Several members of the Koch family later expressed interest into reviving the park in 2012, but later backed out of the deal. This park would eventually reopen under different management in 2014.\n\nThe park suffered a sudden loss in June 2010 when President and [[chief executive officer|CEO]] Will Koch died while swimming at his home. Although the [[Spencer County, Indiana|Spencer County]] coroner listed the official cause of death as drowning, family and park officials believe Koch's [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|type 1 diabetes]] played a factor in his death. Soon after his death, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari named Will's younger brother Dan as the park's new President.<ref name=\"death\">{{cite web|title=Will Koch Drowned|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2010/jun/17/holiday-worlds-will-koch-drowned-says-coroner/|publisher=Evansville Courier & Press|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}</ref> Dan Koch served as the park's President until late 2012, shortly after which the [[board of directors]] announced Matt Eckert as the new President, launching a bitter fight within the family for control of the park and its assets. Matt Eckert was previously one of the parks two [[general manager]]s. Eckert is the first park President not related to the Koch family. They also ousted Pat Koch, Will Sr.'s widow, from any involvement the park. She had been a fixture there for decades.<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/money/2013/10/03/appeals-court-sides-with-widow-in-holiday-world-ownership-dispute/2915659/</ref>\n\nWill Koch's widow Lori and their three children won primary ownership in the park after an ugly court battle and its parent company, Koch Development Corporation. Dan Koch, along with his sister Natalie, would go on in 2014 to form Koch Family Parks and buy [[Alabama Splash Adventure]], a previously troubled theme park in [[Bessemer, Alabama]].<ref name=\"eckert\">{{cite web|title=Holiday World Names New President|url=http://www.courierpress.com/news/2013/jan/08/no-headline---eckert/|publisher=Evansville Courier & Press|accessdate=January 8, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, the park has replaced some of its older rides with newer rides. In Holiday World, Blitzen's Airplanes was replaced with Rudolph's Round-Up in 2011 and in 2012 Paul Revere's Midnight Ride was replaced with Sparkler, a {{convert|65|ft}} tall [[Zamperla]] Vertical Swing ride. Due to limited vertical clearance for Sparkler, the park decided to relocate Star Spangled Carousel to the former location of Paul Revere's Midnight Ride and to place Sparkler in the carousel's place.<ref name=\"swing\">{{cite web|title=Vertical Swing|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3654|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 7, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111122025246/http://www.holidayworld.com/node/3654|archivedate=November 22, 2011|df=}}</ref> The following year, Holiday World removed part of Holidog's Treehouse to make room for a new [[teacups|tea cup]] ride called Kitty's Tea Party. In 2013, the park also removed the only original remaining ride, The Freedom Train, citing maintenance concerns; it was replaced by another train ride which the park named Holidog Express.<ref name=\"train\">{{cite web|title=Holidog Express Blog|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/holiblog/clickety-clack|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=September 6, 2013}}</ref> In Splashin' Safari, Jungle Jets was replaced with Safari Sam's SplashLand in 2011. In 2013, AmaZOOM, Bamboo Chute, Congo River, and Crocodile Isle were removed to make room for a new Splashin' Safari entry plaza; in its place, Hyena Falls and Hyena Springs were added to the north of Giraffica.<ref name=\"timeline\" />\n\n====2014 and 2015 expansions====\nOn September 6, 2013, Holiday World announced plans for a 2014 expansion totaling $8 million.<ref name=\"2014 addition\" /> The highlight of the announcement was a new [[Pirate ship (ride)|swinging ship ride]] called the Mayflower, which is located in the park's Thanksgiving section just to the north of Gobbler Getaway.

Each of the sections features rides, games, food and other attractions that follow the theme of that section's respective holiday. The music that plays over the loud speakers in each section is also themed to that section's respective holiday; guests will often notice the music change as they enter a different section. Splashin' Safari, which is connected to the theme park via entrances in the Halloween and Thanksgiving sections, takes the general theme of a safari.\n\n===Christmas===\nUpon entering Holiday World, guests immediately enter the Christmas section. The Christmas section is the oldest section of Holiday World, dating back to 1946. It was also the only themed area of the park until 1984. Although devoid of any major rides, there is a small sub-section called Rudolph's Reindeer Ranch which is home to several small children's rides. Notable landmarks in this section include a [[Santa Claus]] statue, a [[Christmas tree]], a [[nativity scene]] and the Applause [[fountain]], which was added after the park was awarded the [[IAAPA]] Applause Award in 2004. The Christmas section of the park also includes one of the park's two air-conditioned restaurants: Kringle's Kaf\u00e9, which serves standard theme park fare such as pizza, burgers and ice cream. Since the park's opening in 1946, Santa Claus has been available daily throughout the season to chat with children.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Comet's Rockets\n|style=white-space:nowrap|1970s\n| Children's rocket ride\n|-\n| Dasher's Seahorses\n| 1970s\n| Children's seahorse ride\n|-\n| Prancer's Merry-Go-Round\n| 1970s\n| Children's [[carousel]]\n|-\n| Reindeer Games\n| 2008\n| Three-story family [[drop tower (ride)|drop ride]]\n|-\n| Rudolph's Round-Up\n| 2011\n| Children's sleigh ride\n|-\n|Dancer's Fish\n|1970s\n|Fish-go-round ([[Bulgy the Whale]])\n|-\n|}\n\n===Halloween===\nThe Halloween section was one of two new holidays added in 1984.

The area also has a Goblin Burgers restaurant, which resembles a witch's house, the Frightful Falls log flume that intertwines with The Legend, and the main entrance to Splashin' Safari water park.

It introduced '''George the Eagle''' as its mascot. This area features more attractions than any of the four sections in the theme park. Landmarks in this section include the Hoosier Celebration Theater, where many live shows are performed; the Good Old Days Picnic Grove, where numerous shelter houses may be rented out for company picnics; and The Alamo restaurant, which serves traditional Mexican food. The Fourth of July section is also home to a sub-section called Holidog's FunTown, a children's play area which is completely encircled by Holidog Express. Keeping with the Fourth of July theme, there is also a monument with several [[Flag of the United States|American flags]] located right across from The Alamo restaurant in the center of the section.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Eagles Flight\n| 1976\n| [[Flying Scooters|Flying Scooter]]\n|-\n| Rough Riders\n| 1976\n| [[Bumper car]]s themed after former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Rough Riders]]\n|-\n| Lewis & Clark Trail\n| 1978\n| Gould Manufacturing [[Ford Model T|Tin Lizzie]] antique car ride\n|-\n| Tippecanoes\n| 1988\n| Children's [[canoe]] ride; originally called Indian River Canoes, but renamed to Tippecanoes in 2016\n|-\n| Raging Rapids in Boulder Canyon\n| 1990\n| [[River rapids ride]]\n|-\n| Liberty Launch\n| 2003\n| Seven-story [[S&S Worldwide|S&S]] [[Double Shot (ride)|Double Shot]]\n|-\n| Revolution\n| 2005\n| Dartron Zero Gravity [[round up (ride)|Round Up]] ride\n|-\n| Star Spangled Carousel\n| 2008\n| [[Carousel]]\n|-\n| Holidog Express\n| 2013\n| [[ridable miniature railway|Ridable miniature train]] ride\n|-\n| Firecracker\n| 2017\n| Restored Calypso ride; named after the park's now-defunct steel coaster that was replaced by Holidog's Funtown in 1997\n|}\n\n====Holidog's FunTown====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" | Ride\n! scope=\"col\" | Added\n! scope=\"col\" | Manufacturer\n! scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" | Description\n|-\n| Holidog's Treehouse\n| 1999\n|\n| Three-story play structure; the original was replaced with a new wheelchair accessible play structure in 2017\n|-\n| Just for Pups\n| 1999\n|\n| Smaller version of Holidog's Treehouse that is designed for small children\n|-\n| [[The Howler]]\n| 1999\n| [[Zamperla]]\n| Family [[steel roller coaster]]\n|-\n| Doggone Trail\n| 1999\n|\n| Children's jeep ride\n|-\n| Magic Waters\n| 1999\n|\n| Spray park area\n|-\n| Kitty's Tea Party\n| 2013\n| Zamperla\n| Classic [[teacups|tea cup]] ride\n|}\n\n===Thanksgiving===\nThe Thanksgiving section is the newest section of the park, added in 2006 to commemorate Holiday World's 60th anniversary.

Holiday World has added onto its water park every year from 2002 to 2013. Among those additions are the world's two longest [[Water slide#Water coaster|water coasters]]: [[Wildebeest (ride)|Wildebeest]] and [[Mammoth (ride)|Mammoth]], which are also, respectively, the third and first most expensive additions ever made to the park.

The event features exclusive ride time (ERT) on the park's three wooden roller coasters, plus a select few other rides, both before park opening and after park closing. The event, which was first known as Stark Raven Mad, was temporarily discontinued in 2003 following a death during the event (See: [[Holiday World & Splashin' Safari#Incidents|Incidents]]). In 2006, the event returned after being renamed HoliWood Nights. The park embraces HoliWood's pun on [[Hollywood]] by naming each year's event as a play on the title of a movie. The theme of the 2013 event is \"Dig\", which is a play on the 1988 movie [[Big (film)|Big]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HoliWood Nights|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/clubs|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref>\n* '''Rock the World:'''&nbsp;&ndash; Since 2012, Holiday World has hosted a [[Christian music festival]] called Rock the World on a select Saturday in August. Throughout the day, regional [[Contemporary Christian music|contemporary Christian]] bands perform in the Hoosier Celebration Theater.

The main stage features a number of nationally known Christian artists and bands who perform well past normal closing hours. (The main stage acts in 2012 were [[Jeremy Camp]], [[Tenth Avenue North]], [[BarlowGirl]] and Hearts of Saints).<ref>{{cite web|title=Rock the World|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/rocktheworld|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\n* '''Happy Halloween Weekends:'''&nbsp;&ndash; Since 2012, Holiday World has remained open in October to hold an event called Happy Halloween Weekends. For the last two weekends in September plus the four weekends in October, the park holds family-friendly, Halloween-themed activities. Some of these seasonal attractions include two [[corn maze]]s, [[hayride]]s, a 3-D walk-through attraction similar to a family-friendly [[haunted house]] and a family activity area geared towards children located in the Good Ol' Days Picnic Grove. The park transforms itself into a solely Halloween-themed park, with Halloween decorations, Halloween-themed shows and special Halloween-themed food items. These attractions are hosted in addition to the park's normal offerings of rides, games and food.<ref>{{cite web|title=Happy Halloween Weekends|url=http://www.holidayworld.com/events/happy-halloween-weekends|publisher=Holiday World|accessdate=October 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nIn 2004, Holiday World & Splashin' Safari was presented the [[Applause Award]]. To receive this honor, a park must show \"foresight, originality and creativity, plus sound business development and profitability.\" With an attendance of 883,000 that year, Holiday World was the smallest park to ever receive the award. The park celebrated by installing a large replica of the award's [[trophy]] as well as [[commemorative plaque]]s naming other recipients of the award as part of a fountain in the Christmas section.<ref name=\"applause\" />\n\nHoliday World & Splashin' Safari has also received numerous [[Golden Ticket Awards]], which are presented by [[Amusement Today]] magazine to the best of the best in the amusement park industry.

The victim was visiting the park to attend \"Stark Raven Mad 2003\", an event hosting roller coaster enthusiasts from around the country. At approximately 8:00 pm, the victim and her fianc\u00e9 boarded The Raven in the last row of the train. Following a safety check of her lap bar and seat belt by a ride operator, the train left the station. Multiple witnesses reported that they saw her \"virtually standing up\" during the ride's initial and subsequent drops. During the ride's {{convert|69|ft}} drop, also called the fifth drop, she was ejected from the car and onto the tracks. When the train returned to the station, the victim's fianc\u00e9, ride operators and a passenger who was a doctor ran back along the tracks, at which point they found her lying under the structure of the roller coaster at the fifth drop. The doctor, aided by park medical personnel, began [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] until an ambulance arrived. The victim was pronounced dead en route to the hospital.<ref>{{cite web|title=Prosecutor's Report|url=http://www.masstort.org/Downloads/HW/finalpros.pdf|publisher=Spencer County Prosecutor's Office|accessdate=November 15, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004213338/http://www.masstort.org/Downloads/HW/finalpros.pdf|archive-date=October 4, 2011|url-status=dead|df=}}</ref>\n\n:An investigation following the accident showed that the safety restraints were working properly and that there were no mechanical deficiencies on the roller coaster.

The employee was working alone, mowing an area with some inclines outside the east side of the park when the incident occurred, though the park refused to speculate on exactly what might have happened. The man was found by another employee, who was then able to help lift the lawn mower off the victim with the help of other employees.

The pump surged, forcing a stronger than usual concentration of [[Sodium hypochlorite|liquid bleach]] and [[hydrochloric acid]] into the water. Twenty-four people, including park staff and medical personnel, complained of troubled breathing and [[nausea]]. They were given [[oxygen]] at the park before being transported to [[Jasper, Indiana|Jasper]] Memorial Hospital for treatment. All were treated and released that evening.

Cobb defended his friend and in turn was involved in a shootout in which he was wounded and arrested. Cobb was sentenced to thirteen years in jail.

He besieged the town during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia in 1462, but was seriously wounded during the siege. Two years later, he captured the town.

Peter Aaron attacked Moldavia with Hungarian support in December 1470, but was also defeated by Stephen and executed, along with the [[Moldavian boyars]] who still endorsed him. Stephen restored old fortresses and built new ones, which improved Moldavia's defence system as well as strengthened central administration.\n\nOttoman expansion threatened Moldavian ports in the region of the [[Black Sea]]. In 1473, Stephen stopped paying tribute (''[[hara\u00e7]]'') to the [[Ottoman sultan]] and launched a [[Moldavian\u2013Ottoman Wars|series of campaigns against Wallachia]] in order to replace its rulers \u2013 who had accepted Ottoman suzerainty \u2013 with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. However, each prince who seized the throne with Stephen's support was soon forced to pay homage to the sultan. Stephen eventually defeated a large Ottoman army in the [[Battle of Vaslui]] in 1475. Stephen was referred to as ''[[Athleta Christi]]'' (\"Champion of Christ\") by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], even though Moldavia's hopes for military support went unfulfilled.\n\nThe following year, Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed II]] routed Stephen in the [[Battle of Valea Alb\u0103]], but the lack of provisions and the outbreak of a plague forced him to withdraw from Moldavia. Taking advantage of a truce with Matthias Corvinus, the Ottomans captured Chilia, their [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] allies Cetatea Alb\u0103 (now [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]] in Ukraine) in 1483. Although Corvinus granted two [[Transylvania]]n estates to Stephen, the Moldavian prince paid homage to Casimir, who promised to support him to regain Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103. Stephen's efforts to capture the two ports ended in failure. From 1486, he again paid a yearly tribute to the Ottomans. During the following years, dozens of stone churches and monasteries were built in Moldavia, which contributed to the development of a specific Moldavian architecture.\n\nCasimir IV's successor, [[John I Albert]], wanted to grant Moldavia to his younger brother, [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund]], but Stephen's diplomacy prevented him from invading Moldavia for years. John Albert attacked Moldavia in 1497, but Stephen and his Hungarian and Ottoman allies routed the Polish army in the [[Battle of the Cosmin Forest]]. Stephen again tried to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103, but had to acknowledge the loss of the two ports to the Ottomans in 1503. During his last years, his son and co-ruler [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed|Bogdan III]] played an active role in government. Stephen's long rule represented a period of stability in the history of Moldavia. From the 16th century onwards both his subjects and foreigners remembered him as a great ruler. Modern Romanians regard him as one of their greatest national heroes, although he also endures as a cult figure in [[Moldovenism]]. After the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] canonized him in 1992, he is venerated as \"Stephen the Great and Holy\" (''\u0218tefan cel Mare \u0219i Sf\u00e2nt'').\n\n== Early life ==\n\n[[File:Moldova1483.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A map depicting Moldavia bordered by the river Dniester, the Black Sea and the Carpathian Mountains|The [[Principality of Moldavia]] in 1483]]\n\nStephen was the son of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan]], who was a son of [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]], [[Prince of Moldavia]].{{sfn|P\u0103un|2016|p=131}} Stephen's mother, Maria Oltea,{{sfn|P\u0103un|2016|p=131}}{{sfn|Iliescu|2006|p=79}}{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|p=4}} was most probably related to the princes of [[Wallachia]], according to historian [[Radu Florescu]].{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=66}} The date of Stephen's birth is unknown,{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|Popa|1996|p=190}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} though historians estimate that he was born between 1433 and 1440.{{sfn|Brezianu|Sp\u00e2nu|2007|p=338}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=220}} One church [[diptych]] records that he had five siblings: brothers Ioachim, Ioan, Christea; and sisters Sorea and Maria.{{sfn|Iliescu|2006|p=79}}{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|pp=39-40}} Some of Stephen's biographers hypothesize that C\u00e2rstea Arbore, father of the statesman [[Luca Arbore]], was the prince's fourth brother, or that C\u00e2rstea was the same as Ioachim.{{sfn|E\u0219anu|2013|p=136}} These links with the high-ranking [[Moldavian boyars]] are known to have been preserved through matrimonial connections: Maria, who died in 1486, was the wife of \u0218endrea, gatekeeper of [[Suceava]]; Stephen's other brother-in-law, Isaia, also held high office at his court.{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|pp=4, 8}}{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=40}}\n\nThe death of Alexander the Good in 1432 gave rise to a succession crisis that lasted more than two decades.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=256}}{{sfn|Bolovan|Constantiniu|Michelson|Pop|1997|p=103}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen's father seized the throne in 1449 after defeating one of his relatives with the support of [[John Hunyadi]], Regent-Governor of Hungary.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=256}}{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|p=34}} Stephen was styled ''[[voivode]]'' in his father's charters, showing that he had been made his father's heir and co-ruler.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|p=18}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=31, 212}} Bogdan acknowledged the suzerainty of Hunyadi in 1450.{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|pp=34-35}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen fled to Hungary after [[Peter III Aaron]] (who was also Alexander the Good's son) murdered Bogdan in October 1451.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=66}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=59}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=212}}\n\nVlad Dracula (who had lived in Moldavia during Bogdan II's reign) invaded Wallachia and seized the throne with the support of Hunyadi in 1456.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|pp=58, 61}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen either accompanied Vlad to Wallachia during the military campaign or joined him after Vlad became the ruler of Wallachia.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=98}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} According to reports from the 1480s, Stephen spent part of that interval in [[Br\u0103ila]], where he fathered an illegitimate son, Mircea.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|pp=38, 40-41}} With the assistance of Vlad, Stephen stormed into Moldavia at the head of an army 6,000 strong in the spring of 1457.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=18-19}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=34}} According to Moldavian chronicles, \"men from the Lower Country\" (the southern region of Moldavia) joined him.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Papacostea|1996|p=5}} The 17th-century [[Grigore Ureche]] wrote: \"Stephen routed Peter Aaron [[Battle of Dolje\u0219ti and Orbic|at Dolje\u0219ti]] on 12 April, but Peter Aaron left Moldavia for Poland only after Stephen inflicted a second defeat on him at Orbic.\"{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=212}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=18-19}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Early campaigns ===\n\nOne widely accepted theory, based on Ureche, states that an assembly of boyars and Orthodox clergymen [[Acclamatio|acclaimed]] Stephen the ruler of Moldavia at Direptate, a meadow near Suceava.

These may derive from the colors used by the [[House of Basarab]] (which were possibly used by Stephen's in-law [[Radu the Fair]]), from the [[coat of arms of Hungary]], or from a purely Moldavian tradition.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=67-68, 107, 110}} The division and the striped pattern are possibly Hungarian; they survived in some of Stephen's seals even during his dispute with the Hungarian crown. He also continued to use the ''[[fleur-de-lis]]'', an [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] symbol, but altered it into a \"double-headed lily\", then renounced it altogether.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=109, 111-112, 119-120}} Similarly, he used the [[Cross of Lorraine]], [[Cross patt\u00e9e|patt\u00e9e]], possibly in reference to the [[Pahonia]]. Following his 1489 dispute with Poland, that charge was altered into a double [[cross fleury]].{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=118, 119}} \n\nStephen's heraldic symbols progressively merged with those attributed to the [[House of Mu\u0219at]], and were intensively used by all princes who claimed full or partial descent from Alexander the Good\u2014including [[Peter the Lame]], a Wallachian pretender to Moldavia's throne.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=96, 99-100, 102-108, 111-120}} The Putna tombstones of Stephen's two sons who died during his lifetime, Bogdan and Peter, already display the aurochs within the \"Mu\u0219at coat-of-arms\".{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=98-99}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=102-103}} \n\nA Moldavian banner also survives in hand-colored versions illustrating [[Johannes de Thurocz]]'s ''[[Chronica Hungarorum]]'', with varying tinctures. These were first identified as Stephen's flags by [[Constantin Karadja]], and described by later authors as a version of the or-an-vert scheme in the coat of arms.{{sfn|Tiron|2012|pp=71-75}} Other clues suggest that the field was a solid one of or, charged with an aurochs of or, but also that the preferred \"single Moldavian\" color was gules.{{sfn|Tiron|2012|pp=76-80}} Gules is also the color of Stephen's alleged [[war flag]], defaced with an icon of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] and donated by the prince himself to [[Zograf monastery]]. However, scholar Petre \u0218. N\u0103sturel cautions that this may not be a heraldic object of any kind, but rather a [[votive offering]]. The \"war flag\", he notes, is to small to carry in battle, and does not match with images in either Thurocz or [[Marcin Bielski]], nor with the description in [[Alexander Guagnini]].{{sfn|N\u0103sturel|2005|pp=48-49}}\n\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:Moldavia's coat of Arms of 1481.jpg|alt=A coat of arms depicting the head of an aurochs with a crescent and a star over it|[[Coat of arms of Moldavia]] at [[Putna Monastery]]\nFile:Coa Romania Country History \u0218tefan cel Mare (1457-1504) v2.svg|alt=A coat of arms depicting stripes, a double cross, roses and sun|One variant of Stephen's personal coat of arms, with hypothetical [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]]\nFile:Moldavia - Ulrich von Richental.svg|alt=A coat of arms with three black heads|[[Attributed arms]] of Moldavia, with three [[Maure]]s\nFile:Battle Flag of Moldavia (1467) - 2nd version.svg|alt=Triangular flag with aurochs head and stripes|One possible rendition of the Moldavian flag, based on [[Johannes de Thurocz]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Neam\u021b Citadel]]\n*[[Borze\u0219ti Church]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Arge\u0219]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Bac\u0103u]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Neam\u021b]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Olt]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Vaslui]]\n*[[Saligny, Constan\u021ba]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|18em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Achim |first=Viorel |year=2004 |title=The Roma in Romanian History |publisher=Central European University Press |isbn=963-9241-84-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bain |first=Robert Nisbet |authorlink=Robert Nisbet Bain |year=1908 |title=Slavonic Europe.

He was the son of and co-ruler with [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan II]], who was murdered in 1451 in a conspiracy organized by his brother and Stephen's uncle [[Peter Aaron|Peter III Aaron]] who took the throne. Stephen fled to [[Kingdom of Hungary (1301\u20131526)|Hungary]], and later to  [[Wallachia]], but with the support of [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad III Dracula]], [[Voivode of Wallachia]], he returned to Moldavia, forcing Aaron to seek refuge in [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Poland]] in the summer of 1457. [[Teoctist I of Moldavia|Teoctist I]], [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Metropolitan of Moldavia]], [[Anointing|anointed]] Stephen prince. He attacked Poland and prevented [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]], [[King of Poland]], from supporting Peter Aaron, but eventually acknowledged Casimir's suzerainty in 1459.\n\nStephen decided to recapture Chilia (now [[Kiliya]] in Ukraine), an important port on the Danube, which brought him into conflict with Hungary and Wallachia. He besieged the town during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia in 1462, but was seriously wounded during the siege. Two years later, he captured the town. He promised support to the leaders of the [[Unio Trium Nationum|Three Nations of Transylvania]] against [[Matthias Corvinus]], [[King of Hungary]], in 1467. Corvinus invaded Moldavia, but Stephen defeated him in the [[Battle of Baia]]. Peter Aaron attacked Moldavia with Hungarian support in December 1470, but was also defeated by Stephen and executed, along with the [[Moldavian boyars]] who still endorsed him. Stephen restored old fortresses and built new ones, which improved Moldavia's defence system as well as strengthened central administration.\n\nOttoman expansion threatened Moldavian ports in the region of the [[Black Sea]]. In 1473, Stephen stopped paying tribute (''[[hara\u00e7]]'') to the [[Ottoman sultan]] and launched a [[Moldavian\u2013Ottoman Wars|series of campaigns against Wallachia]] in order to replace its rulers \u2013 who had accepted Ottoman suzerainty \u2013 with his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. However, each prince who seized the throne with Stephen's support was soon forced to pay homage to the sultan. Stephen eventually defeated a large Ottoman army in the [[Battle of Vaslui]] in 1475. Stephen was referred to as ''[[Athleta Christi]]'' (\"Champion of Christ\") by [[Pope Sixtus IV]], even though Moldavia's hopes for military support went unfulfilled.\n\nThe following year, Ottoman Sultan [[Mehmed II]] routed Stephen in the [[Battle of Valea Alb\u0103]], but the lack of provisions and the outbreak of a plague forced him to withdraw from Moldavia. Taking advantage of a truce with Matthias Corvinus, the Ottomans captured Chilia, their [[Crimean Tatars|Crimean Tatar]] allies Cetatea Alb\u0103 (now [[Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi]] in Ukraine) in 1483. Although Corvinus granted two [[Transylvania]]n estates to Stephen, the Moldavian prince paid homage to Casimir, who promised to support him to regain Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103. Stephen's efforts to capture the two ports ended in failure. From 1486, he again paid a yearly tribute to the Ottomans. During the following years, dozens of stone churches and monasteries were built in Moldavia, which contributed to the development of a specific Moldavian architecture.\n\nCasimir IV's successor, [[John I Albert]], wanted to grant Moldavia to his younger brother, [[Sigismund I the Old|Sigismund]], but Stephen's diplomacy prevented him from invading Moldavia for years. John Albert attacked Moldavia in 1497, but Stephen and his Hungarian and Ottoman allies routed the Polish army in the [[Battle of the Cosmin Forest]]. Stephen again tried to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Alb\u0103, but had to acknowledge the loss of the two ports to the Ottomans in 1503. During his last years, his son and co-ruler [[Bogdan III the One-Eyed|Bogdan III]] played an active role in government. Stephen's long rule represented a period of stability in the history of Moldavia. From the 16th century onwards both his subjects and foreigners remembered him as a great ruler. Modern Romanians regard him as one of their greatest national heroes, although he also endures as a cult figure in [[Moldovenism]]. After the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] canonized him in 1992, he is venerated as \"Stephen the Great and Holy\" (''\u0218tefan cel Mare \u0219i Sf\u00e2nt'').\n\n== Early life ==\n\n[[File:Moldova1483.jpg|right|thumb|alt=A map depicting Moldavia bordered by the river Dniester, the Black Sea and the Carpathian Mountains|The [[Principality of Moldavia]] in 1483]]\n\nStephen was the son of [[Bogdan II of Moldavia|Bogdan]], who was a son of [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]], [[Prince of Moldavia]].{{sfn|P\u0103un|2016|p=131}} Stephen's mother, Maria Oltea,{{sfn|P\u0103un|2016|p=131}}{{sfn|Iliescu|2006|p=79}}{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|p=4}} was most probably related to the princes of [[Wallachia]], according to historian [[Radu Florescu]].{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=66}} The date of Stephen's birth is unknown,{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|Popa|1996|p=190}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} though historians estimate that he was born between 1433 and 1440.{{sfn|Brezianu|Sp\u00e2nu|2007|p=338}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=220}} One church [[diptych]] records that he had five siblings: brothers Ioachim, Ioan, Christea; and sisters Sorea and Maria.{{sfn|Iliescu|2006|p=79}}{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|pp=39-40}} Some of Stephen's biographers hypothesize that C\u00e2rstea Arbore, father of the statesman [[Luca Arbore]], was the prince's fourth brother, or that C\u00e2rstea was the same as Ioachim.{{sfn|E\u0219anu|2013|p=136}} These links with the high-ranking [[Moldavian boyars]] are known to have been preserved through matrimonial connections: Maria, who died in 1486, was the wife of \u0218endrea, gatekeeper of [[Suceava]]; Stephen's other brother-in-law, Isaia, also held high office at his court.{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|pp=4, 8}}{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=40}}\n\nThe death of Alexander the Good in 1432 gave rise to a succession crisis that lasted more than two decades.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=256}}{{sfn|Bolovan|Constantiniu|Michelson|Pop|1997|p=103}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen's father seized the throne in 1449 after defeating one of his relatives with the support of [[John Hunyadi]], Regent-Governor of Hungary.{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=256}}{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|p=34}} Stephen was styled ''[[voivode]]'' in his father's charters, showing that he had been made his father's heir and co-ruler.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|p=18}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=31, 212}} Bogdan acknowledged the suzerainty of Hunyadi in 1450.{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|pp=34-35}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen fled to Hungary after [[Peter III Aaron]] (who was also Alexander the Good's son) murdered Bogdan in October 1451.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Florescu|McNally|1989|p=66}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=59}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=212}}\n\nVlad Dracula (who had lived in Moldavia during Bogdan II's reign) invaded Wallachia and seized the throne with the support of Hunyadi in 1456.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|pp=58, 61}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Stephen either accompanied Vlad to Wallachia during the military campaign or joined him after Vlad became the ruler of Wallachia.{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=98}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} According to reports from the 1480s, Stephen spent part of that interval in [[Br\u0103ila]], where he fathered an illegitimate son, Mircea.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|pp=38, 40-41}} With the assistance of Vlad, Stephen stormed into Moldavia at the head of an army 6,000 strong in the spring of 1457.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=18-19}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=34}} According to Moldavian chronicles, \"men from the Lower Country\" (the southern region of Moldavia) joined him.{{sfn|Sacerdo\u021beanu|1969|p=38}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Papacostea|1996|p=5}} The 17th-century [[Grigore Ureche]] wrote: \"Stephen routed Peter Aaron [[Battle of Dolje\u0219ti and Orbic|at Dolje\u0219ti]] on 12 April, but Peter Aaron left Moldavia for Poland only after Stephen inflicted a second defeat on him at Orbic.\"{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=212}}{{sfn|Treptow|2000|p=99}}{{better source|date=July 2017}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=18-19}}\n\n== Reign ==\n\n=== Early campaigns ===\n\nOne widely accepted theory, based on Ureche, states that an assembly of boyars and Orthodox clergymen [[Acclamatio|acclaimed]] Stephen the ruler of Moldavia at Direptate, a meadow near Suceava. According to scholar Constantin Rezachievici, this elective custom has no precedent before the 17th century, and appears superfluous in Stephen's case; he argues that it was a legend fabricated by Ureche.{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=17\u201318, 20\u201330}} While this election remains uncertain, various historians agree that [[Teoctist I of Moldavia|Teoctist I]], [[Metropolis of Moldavia and Bukovina|Metropolitan of Moldavia]], [[Anointing|anointed]] Stephen prince.{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|p=3}}{{sfn|Rezachievici|2007|pp=25, 27}}{{sfn|Pop|2005|p=266}}{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008|pp=106-108, 138}} To emphasize the sacred nature of his rule, Stephen styled himself \"[[By the Grace of God]], ... Stephen voivode, lord (or ''[[hospodar]]'') of the Moldavian lands\" on 13 September 1457.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=32-33}} His use of Christian devices for legitimization overlapped with a troubled context for Moldavian Orthodoxy: the [[Council of Florence|attempted Catholic\u2013Orthodox union]] had divided the [[Byzantine Rite]] churches into supporters and dissidents; likewise, the [[Fall of Constantinople]] had encouraged local bishops to consider themselves independent of the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarchy]]. There is a long standing dispute about whether Teoctist was a dissenter, belonging to one of the several emancipated Orthodox jurisdictions, or a loyalist of [[Isidore II of Constantinople|Patriarch Isidore]].{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008}} Historian Dan Ioan Mure\u0219an argues that the evidence is for the latter option, because Moldavia appears on the list of Patriarchate jurisdictions, and because Stephen, though he tested the Patriarch by sometimes using imperial titles such as ''[[tsar]]'' by 1473, was never threatened with [[excommunication]].{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008|pp=102-180}}\n\nAs one of his earliest actions as prince, Stephen attacked Poland to prevent Casimir IV from supporting Peter Aaron in 1458.{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|p=3}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=38, 213}} This first military campaign \"established his credentials as a military commander of stature\", according to historian Jonathan Eagles.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=38}} However, he wanted to avoid prolonged conflict with Poland, because the recapture of Chilia was his principal aim.{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|p=43}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} Chilia was an important port on the Danube that [[Petru III of Moldavia|Peter II of Moldavia]] had surrendered to Hungary in 1448.{{sfn|Demciuc|2004|p=3}}{{sfn|Ciobanu|1991|p=33}}{{better source|date=July 2017}} He signed a treaty with Poland on the river [[Dniester]] on 4 April

Empire, expelling from Moldavia the [[Franciscans]], who were agitating for a united church and a crusade.{{sfn|Mure\u0219an|2008|p=110}} Stephen continued to pay the yearly tribute to the Ottoman

Initially, [[Censorship in Communist Romania|censorship]] toned down or removed references to his legacy in [[Moldovan Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Bessarabia]] or [[Pokuttya]];{{sfn|Otu|2019|pp=66-67}} in the 1980s, however, official historians claimed that Stephen was literally a \"lord of all Romanians\".{{sfn|Boia|2001|pp=140, 222, 249-250}} Iorga's book has been republished several times, including on the 500th anniversary of Stephen's death.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=88-89}} On the same anniversary, Stephen was presented as a symbol of \"national identity, independence and inter-ethnic harmony\" in the [[Republic of Moldova]],{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=89}} where he also endures as the symbol of \"Moldavian particularism\"{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=140}} or \"Moldovan patriotism\".{{sfn|Cojocari|2007|p=93}} Thus, Stephen was invoked by both the [[Popular Front of Moldova]], which favored Romanian identity, and the Moldovenist [[Party of Communists of the Republic of Moldova|Party of Communists]].{{sfn|Cojocari|2007|pp=90-97, 100-102}} The latter describes Stephen as \"the founder of Moldavian statehood\", claiming direct continuity from his principality to the present-day state.{{sfn|Cojocari|2007|pp=101-104}}\n\nAs Eagles notes, \"Stephen is an ever-present icon\" in both Romania and Moldova: \"statues of his image abound; politicians cite him as an exemplar; schools and [[\u0218tefan cel Mare University of Suceava|a university bear his name]]; villages and the main thoroughfares of towns and cities are named after him; there is a [[\u0218tefan cel Mare metro station]] in central Bucharest; and his crowned head has adorned ''every'' banknote in the [[Post-Soviet states|post-Soviet]] Moldovan republic\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=1}} According to a 1999 [[opinion poll]], more than 13% of the participants regarded Stephen the Great as the most important personality who had \"influenced the destiny of the Romanians for the better\".{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=17}} Seven years later, during a programme called the ''[[100 Greatest Romanians]]'' on [[Romanian Television]], he was voted \"the greatest Romanian of all time\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=83}}\n\n=== Holy ruler ===\n{{Infobox saint\n|name= Saint Stephen the Great\n|image=Tablou votiv Manastirea Dobrovat 1503.jpg\n|caption=Votive depiction of Stephen at [[Dobrov\u0103\u021b Monastery]]\n|feast_day=July 2\n|venerated_in= [[Romanian Orthodox Church]]\n|titles= Holy Voivode\n|canonized_date=July 12, 1992\n|canonized_place=[[Bucharest]], [[Romania]]\n|canonized_by=[[Romanian Orthodox Church]]\n|major_shrine=[[Putna Monastery]]\n|suppressed_date=\n|issues=\n}}\n\nIn [[Mount Athos|Athonite]] legends, Romanian stories, and Moldavian chronicles alike, Stephen's victories against the Ottomans and Hungarians were already regarded as God-inspired, or as placed under the direct patronage of various saints ([[Saint George|George]], [[Demetrius of Thessaloniki|Demetrius]], [[Procopius of Scythopolis|Procopius]], or [[Saint Mercurius|Mercurius]]).{{sfn|Cristea|2016|pp=316-340}}{{sfn|Schipor|2004|p=206}} Worship of Stephen himself was first recorded in the 1570s,{{sfn|Simon|2009|p=233}} but, according to Ureche, he had been regarded as a saint soon after his funeral: \"not on account of his soul ... for he was a man with sins ... but on account of the great deeds he accomplished\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=77}} The positive nuances of Ureche's report were also repeated by [[Miron Costin]].{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=77}} \n\nThe abbot of Putna Monastery, Artimon Bortnic, initiated the investigation of the tomb room of the monastery in 1851, referring to important shrines in Russia and Moldavia.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=110}} In 1857 (a year after Stephen's tomb was opened), the priest and journalist Iraclie Porumbescu already wrote of the \"holy bones of Putna\".{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=93}} In at least some legends attested by 1903, the voivode is depicted as an immortal [[King asleep in mountain|sleeping hero]], or, alternatively, as the ruler of heaven.{{sfn|Schipor|2004|p=202}} However, Stephen the Great was ignored when the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]] canonized the first Romanian saints in the 1950s.{{sfn|Boia|2001|p=73}}\n\n[[Teoctist Ar\u0103pa\u0219u|Teoctist]], [[Patriarch of All Romania]], canonized Stephen along with 12 other saints at [[Saint Spyridon the New Church]] in Bucharest on 21 June 1992.{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=195}} On this occasion, the patriarch emphasized that Stephen had been a defender of Christianity and protector of his people.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=78}} He also underlined that Stephen had built churches during his reign.{{sfn|Eagles|2014|p=78}} Stephen's feast day is July 2 (the day of his death) in the calendar of the Romanian Orthodox Church. On his first feast after his canonization, a new ceremony was held to celebrate Stephen the Great and Saint in Putna.{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=195}} 15,000 people (including the [[President of Romania]] at the time, [[Ion Iliescu]], and two ministers) attended the event.{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=196}} Patriarch Teoctist noted that \"God has brought us together under the same skies, just as Stephen rallied us under the same flag in the past.\"{{sfn|Ramet|1998|p=196}}\n\n==Arms==\nStephen's rule consolidated the usage of the [[coat of arms of Moldavia]], featuring the [[aurochs]] head (first attested in 1387), sometimes as a [[Helmet (heraldry)|helmet]] atop his personal arms. He revived the elaborate design introduced under [[Alexander I of Moldavia|Alexander the Good]], which also featured a [[Rose (heraldry)|rose]], [[crescent]], [[Sun (heraldry)|sun]] and star (often, but not always, [[Five-pointed star|five-pointed]]); its [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]] remain unknown.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=83-85, 98-120}} This arrangement was not familiar to heraldists in Western Europe. By the 1530s, they represented Moldavia with [[attributed arms]] featuring [[Maure]]s; these arms, though originally used for Wallachia, possibly echoed Stephen's victories over the Ottomans.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=77-81, 126}}\n\nThe personal arms and [[heraldic flag]]s used by Stephen have been the topic of additional scrutiny and debate. Stephen is known to have used a ''[[Division of the field|party per cross]]'' shield with one striped quarter, but the colors are uncertain: one prevailing interpretation is that the dominant tinctures were [[Or (heraldry)|or]] and [[Vert (heraldry)|vert]], although they may also have been [[gules]] and [[argent]]. These may derive from the colors used by the [[House of Basarab]] (which were possibly used by Stephen's in-law [[Radu the Fair]]), from the [[coat of arms of Hungary]], or from a purely Moldavian tradition.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=67-68, 107, 110}} The division and the striped pattern are possibly Hungarian; they survived in some of Stephen's seals even during his dispute with the Hungarian crown. He also continued to use the ''[[fleur-de-lis]]'', an [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] symbol, but altered it into a \"double-headed lily\", then renounced it altogether.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=109, 111-112, 119-120}} Similarly, he used the [[Cross of Lorraine]], [[Cross patt\u00e9e|patt\u00e9e]], possibly in reference to the [[Pahonia]]. Following his 1489 dispute with Poland, that charge was altered into a double [[cross fleury]].{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=118, 119}} \n\nStephen's heraldic symbols progressively merged with those attributed to the [[House of Mu\u0219at]], and were intensively used by all princes who claimed full or partial descent from Alexander the Good\u2014including [[Peter the Lame]], a Wallachian pretender to Moldavia's throne.{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=96, 99-100, 102-108, 111-120}} The Putna tombstones of Stephen's two sons who died during his lifetime, Bogdan and Peter, already display the aurochs within the \"Mu\u0219at coat-of-arms\".{{sfn|Cernovodeanu|1977|pp=98-99}}{{sfn|Eagles|2014|pp=102-103}} \n\nA Moldavian banner also survives in hand-colored versions illustrating [[Johannes de Thurocz]]'s ''[[Chronica Hungarorum]]'', with varying tinctures. These were first identified as Stephen's flags by [[Constantin Karadja]], and described by later authors as a version of the or-an-vert scheme in the coat of arms.{{sfn|Tiron|2012|pp=71-75}} Other clues suggest that the field was a solid one of or, charged with an aurochs of or, but also that the preferred \"single Moldavian\" color was gules.{{sfn|Tiron|2012|pp=76-80}} Gules is also the color of Stephen's alleged [[war flag]], defaced with an icon of [[Saint George and the Dragon]] and donated by the prince himself to [[Zograf monastery]]. However, scholar Petre \u0218. N\u0103sturel cautions that this may not be a heraldic object of any kind, but rather a [[votive offering]]. The \"war flag\", he notes, is to small to carry in battle, and does not match with images in either Thurocz or [[Marcin Bielski]], nor with the description in [[Alexander Guagnini]].{{sfn|N\u0103sturel|2005|pp=48-49}}\n\n<gallery class=center>\nFile:Moldavia's coat of Arms of 1481.jpg|alt=A coat of arms depicting the head of an aurochs with a crescent and a star over it|[[Coat of arms of Moldavia]] at [[Putna Monastery]]\nFile:Coa Romania Country History \u0218tefan cel Mare (1457-1504) v2.svg|alt=A coat of arms depicting stripes, a double cross, roses and sun|One variant of Stephen's personal coat of arms, with hypothetical [[Tincture (heraldry)|tinctures]]\nFile:Moldavia - Ulrich von Richental.svg|alt=A coat of arms with three black heads|[[Attributed arms]] of Moldavia, with three [[Maure]]s\nFile:Battle Flag of Moldavia (1467) - 2nd version.svg|alt=Triangular flag with aurochs head and stripes|One possible rendition of the Moldavian flag, based on [[Johannes de Thurocz]]\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Neam\u021b Citadel]]\n*[[Borze\u0219ti Church]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Arge\u0219]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Bac\u0103u]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, C\u0103l\u0103ra\u0219i]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Neam\u021b]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Olt]]\n*[[\u0218tefan cel Mare, Vaslui]]\n*[[Saligny, Constan\u021ba]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|18em}}\n\n== Sources ==\n{{Refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite book |last=Achim |first=Viorel |year=2004 |title=The Roma in Romanian History |publisher=Central European University Press |isbn=963-9241-84-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Bain |first=Robert Nisbet |authorlink=Robert Nisbet Bain |year=1908 |title=Slavonic Europe.
