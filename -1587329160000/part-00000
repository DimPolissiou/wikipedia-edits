He and his girlfriend Tina ([[Rosie Perez]]) have a toddler son named Hector. He works at the local pizzeria, and lacks ambition. Sal ([[Danny Aiello]]), the pizzeria's [[Italian-American]] owner, has been in the neighborhood for 25 years. His older son Pino intensely dislikes black people, and does not get along with Mookie. Because of this, Pino is at odds with both his father, who refuses to leave the neighborhood, which is increasingly [[African-American neighborhood|majority African-American]], and his younger brother Vito, who is friendly with Mookie.\n\nMany distinctive residents are introduced, including Da Mayor, a friendly drunk; Mother Sister ([[Ruby Dee]]), who watches the neighborhood from her [[brownstone]]; Radio Raheem, who blasts [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] on his [[boombox]] wherever he goes; and Smiley, a [[mentally disabled]] man, who meanders around the neighborhood trying to sell hand-colored pictures of [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]\n\nWhile at Sal's, Mookie's friend Buggin' Out, known for trouble-making and [[Breakdancing|b-boying]], questions Sal about his \"Wall of Fame\", a wall decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. Buggin' Out demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal replies that it is his business, and that he can have whoever he wants on \"The Wall of Fame\". Buggin' Out attempts to start a protest over the Wall of Fame. Only Radio Raheem and Smiley support him.\n\nDuring the day, the heat and tensions begin to rise. The local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the street, before police officers intervene. Mookie and Pino begin arguing over race. Mookie confronts Pino about his negative attitudes towards African Americans, although the latter's favorite celebrities are black. Various characters express flowery racial insults to the camera: Mookie against Italians, Pino against African Americans, Latino Stevie against Koreans, white police officer Gary Long against Puerto Ricans, and Korean store owner Sonny ([[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]]) against Jews. Pino and Sal talk about the neighborhood, with Pino expressing his contempt for African Americans, and Sal insisting that he is not leaving. Sal almost fires Mookie, but Jade intervenes, before Mookie confronts her for being too close to Sal.\n\nThat night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march into Sal's and demand that Sal change the Wall of Fame. Raheem's boombox is blaring and Sal demands that he turn it off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out calls Sal and sons \"guineas\", and threatens to close down the pizzeria until they change the Wall of Fame. Frustrated and angry after being called a \"guinea bastard\" and threatened by Buggin' Out, Sal calls Buggin' Out a \"[[nigger]]\" and destroys Raheem's boombox with a baseball bat. \n\nRaheem attacks Sal, leading to a violent fight that spills out into the street, and attracts a crowd. The brawl gets so bad, the police are called. While Raheem is choking Sal, the police arrive. They break up the fight and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. Despite the pleas of fellow officers and onlookers, one officer refuses to release his chokehold on Raheem, killing him. Realizing that Raheem has been killed in front of witnesses, the officers place his body in the back of a [[Police car|squad car]] and drive off, leaving Sal, Pino, and Vito unprotected.\n\nThe onlookers, enraged about Radio Raheem's death, blame Sal and his sons. Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the window of Sal's pizzeria, sparking the crowd to rush into the restaurant and destroy it. Smiley finally sets it on fire, diverting violent revenge against Sal. Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito out of the mob's way. Firemen and riot patrols arrive to put out the fire and disperse the crowd. After police issue a warning, the firefighters turn their hoses on the rioters, leading to more fighting and arrests. Mookie and Jade sit on the curb, watching in disbelief. Smiley wanders back into the smoldering building and hangs one of his pictures on what is left of Sal's Wall of Fame.\n\nThe next day, after an argument with Tina, Mookie returns to Sal. He feels that Mookie had betrayed him. Mookie demands his weekly pay, which leads to an argument. The two men cautiously reconcile, and Sal finally pays Mookie. Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, a local DJ, dedicates a song to Radio Raheem.\n\nThe film ends with two quotations that express different views about violence, one by Martin Luther King and one by Malcolm X. It fades to a photograph of the two leaders shaking hands. Prior to the credits, Lee dedicates the film to the families of six victims of police brutality or racial violence: [[Eleanor Bumpurs]], [[Michael Griffith (manslaughter victim)|Michael Griffith]], Arthur Miller, Jr., [[Edmund Perry]], Yvonne Smallwood, and [[Death of Michael Stewart|Michael Stewart]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Spike Lee]] as Mookie\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Sal\n* [[Ossie Davis]] as Da Mayor\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Mother Sister\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Buggin' Out\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as [[Radio Raheem]]\n* [[John Turturro]] as Pino\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Vito\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as Smiley\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Tina\n* [[Joie Lee]] as Jade\n* [[Steve White (actor)|Steve White]] as Ahmad\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Cee\n* Leonard L.

He was also inspired by the 1986 [[Howard Beach racial incident]], in which an African-American man was killed, and the [[shooting of Eleanor Bumpurs]] by police.<ref name=ew>{{cite news|last1=Staskiewicz|first1=Keith|title=Do the Right Thing: 1989|work=Entertainment Weekly|issue=1282/1283|date=October 25, 2013|page=42}}</ref> Lee wrote the screenplay in two weeks.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/fight-the-power-spike-lee-on-do-the-right-thing-20140620 |title= Fight the Power: Spike Lee on 'Do the Right Thing' |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |author= Gavin Edwards |date= 20 June 2014  |access-date= 29 April 2015}}</ref> \n\nThe original script of ''Do the Right Thing'' ended with a stronger reconciliation between Mookie and Sal than Lee used in the film. In this version, Sal's comments to Mookie are similar to Da Mayor's earlier comments in the film and hint at some common ground, and perhaps Sal's understanding of why Mookie tried to destroy his restaurant. Lee did not explain why he changed the ending.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/do-the-right-thing-script.html |title='Do the Right Thing' Script (Archived) |publisher=Script-O-Rama |date=28 April 2007 |access-date=29 April 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070428033003/http://www.script-o-rama.com/movie_scripts/d/do-the-right-thing-script.html |archivedate=April 28, 2007 }}</ref>\n\n===Casting===\nLee campaigned for [[Robert De Niro]] to play Sal the pizzeria owner, but De Niro had to decline due to prior commitments. Aiello eventually played Sal and his son Rick played Gary Long, the police officer who kills Radio Raheem. The character of Smiley was not in the original script; he was created by [[Roger Guenveur Smith]], who was pestering Lee for a role in the film.<ref>Do The Right Thing DVD Audio Commentary</ref> \n\nFour of the cast members were stand-up comedians: [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]], [[Steve White (actor)|Steve White]], and [[Robin Harris]]. Lee originally wanted Nunn to play the role of Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, but later recast him as Radio Raheem. The acting couple Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee were friends of Lee's father [[Bill Lee (musician)|Bill]]; they were cast as Mother Sister and Da Mayor.<ref name=ew/> Perez was cast as Mookie's love interest Tina after Lee saw her dancing at a Los Angeles dance club. Perez decided to take the part because her sister lived four blocks from the set. She had never been in a film before and became upset during the filming of Radio Raheem's death scene.<ref name=ew/>\n\n===Filming===\nThe film was shot entirely on Stuyvesant Avenue between Quincy Street and Lexington Avenue in the [[Bedford\u2013Stuyvesant]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]]. The street's color scheme was altered by the production designer, who used a great deal of red and orange paint to convey the sense of a heatwave. The Korean grocery store and Sal's pizzeria were built from scratch on two empty lots. The pizzeria was fully functional and the actors cooked pizzas in the ovens. During filming, the neighborhood's [[crack cocaine|crack]] dealers threatened the film crew for disturbing their business there. Lee hired [[Fruit of Islam]] members to provide security.<ref name=ew/> Jackson later revealed that he spent much of his time on set sleeping as he has no scenes outside.<ref name=ew/>\n\n==Reception==\n\n===Critical reception===\n{{expand section|date=September 2016}}\nFilm critics acclaimed ''Do the Right Thing''.

Jackson]], and is the feature film debut of [[Martin Lawrence]] and [[Rosie Perez]]. The story explores a Brooklyn neighborhood's simmering racial tension, which culminates in violence and a death on a hot summer day.\n\nThe film was a commercial success and received numerous accolades, including [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations for [[Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay|Best Original Screenplay]] and [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Aiello's portrayal of Sal the pizzeria owner.

He and his girlfriend Tina ([[Rosie Perez]]) have a toddler son named Hector. He works at the local pizzeria, and lacks ambition. Sal ([[Danny Aiello]]), the pizzeria's [[Italian-American]] owner, has been in the neighborhood for 25 years. His older son Pino intensely dislikes black people, and does not get along with Mookie. Because of this, Pino is at odds with both his father, who refuses to leave the neighborhood, which is increasingly [[African-American neighborhood|majority African-American]], and his younger brother Vito, who is friendly with Mookie.\n\nMany distinctive residents are introduced, including Da Mayor , a friendly drunk; Mother Sister ([[Ruby Dee]]), who watches the neighborhood from her [[brownstone]]; Radio Raheem, who blasts [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]] on his [[boombox]] wherever he goes; and Smiley, a [[mentally disabled]] man, who meanders around the neighborhood trying to sell hand-colored pictures of [[Malcolm X]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]\n\nWhile at Sal's, Mookie's friend Buggin' Out, known for trouble-making and [[Breakdancing|b-boying]], questions Sal about his \"Wall of Fame\", a wall decorated with photos of famous Italian-Americans. Buggin' Out demands that Sal put up pictures of black celebrities since Sal's pizzeria is in a black neighborhood. Sal replies that it is his business, and that he can have whoever he wants on \"The Wall of Fame\". Buggin' Out attempts to start a protest over the Wall of Fame. Only Radio Raheem and Smiley support him.\n\nDuring the day, the heat and tensions begin to rise. The local teenagers open a fire hydrant and douse the street, before police officers intervene. Mookie and Pino begin arguing over race. Mookie confronts Pino about his negative attitudes towards African Americans, although the latter's favorite celebrities are black. Various characters express flowery racial insults to the camera: Mookie against Italians, Pino against African Americans, Latino Stevie against Koreans, white police officer Gary Long against Puerto Ricans, and Korean store owner Sonny ([[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]]) against Jews. Pino and Sal talk about the neighborhood, with Pino expressing his contempt for African Americans, and Sal insisting that he is not leaving. Sal almost fires Mookie, but Jade intervenes, before Mookie confronts her for being too close to Sal.\n\nThat night, Buggin' Out, Radio Raheem, and Smiley march into Sal's and demand that Sal change the Wall of Fame. Raheem's boombox is blaring and Sal demands that he turn it off, but he refuses. Buggin' Out calls Sal and sons \"guineas\", and threatens to close down the pizzeria until they change the Wall of Fame. Frustrated and angry after being called a \"guinea bastard\" and threatened by Buggin' Out, Sal calls Buggin' Out a \"[[nigger]]\" and destroys Raheem's boombox with a baseball bat. \n\nRaheem attacks Sal, leading to a violent fight that spills out into the street, and attracts a crowd. The brawl gets so bad, the police are called. While Raheem is choking Sal, the police arrive. They break up the fight and apprehend Raheem and Buggin' Out. Despite the pleas of fellow officers and onlookers, one officer refuses to release his chokehold on Raheem, killing him. Realizing that Raheem has been killed in front of witnesses, the officers place his body in the back of a [[Police car|squad car]] and drive off, leaving Sal, Pino, and Vito unprotected.\n\nThe onlookers, enraged about Radio Raheem's death, blame Sal and his sons. Mookie grabs a trash can and throws it through the window of Sal's pizzeria, sparking the crowd to rush into the restaurant and destroy it. Smiley finally sets it on fire, diverting violent revenge against Sal. Da Mayor pulls Sal, Pino, and Vito out of the mob's way. Firemen and riot patrols arrive to put out the fire and disperse the crowd. After police issue a warning, the firefighters turn their hoses on the rioters, leading to more fighting and arrests. Mookie and Jade sit on the curb, watching in disbelief. Smiley wanders back into the smoldering building and hangs one of his pictures on what is left of Sal's Wall of Fame.\n\nThe next day, after an argument with Tina, Mookie returns to Sal. He feels that Mookie had betrayed him. Mookie demands his weekly pay, which leads to an argument. The two men cautiously reconcile, and Sal finally pays Mookie. Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, a local DJ, dedicates a song to Radio Raheem.\n\nThe film ends with two quotations that express different views about violence, one by Martin Luther King and one by Malcolm X. It fades to a photograph of the two leaders shaking hands. Prior to the credits, Lee dedicates the film to the families of six victims of police brutality or racial violence: [[Eleanor Bumpurs]], [[Michael Griffith (manslaughter victim)|Michael Griffith]], Arthur Miller, Jr., [[Edmund Perry]], Yvonne Smallwood, and [[Death of Michael Stewart|Michael Stewart]].\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Spike Lee]] as Mookie\n* [[Danny Aiello]] as Sal\n* [[Ossie Davis]] as Da Mayor\n* [[Ruby Dee]] as Mother Sister\n* [[Giancarlo Esposito]] as Buggin' Out\n* [[Bill Nunn]] as [[Radio Raheem]]\n* [[John Turturro]] as Pino\n* [[Richard Edson]] as Vito\n* [[Roger Guenveur Smith]] as Smiley\n* [[Rosie Perez]] as Tina\n* [[Joie Lee]] as Jade\n* [[Steve White (actor)|Steve White]] as Ahmad\n* [[Martin Lawrence]] as Cee\n* Leonard L.

He was also inspired by the 1986 [[Howard Beach racial incident]], in which an African-American man was killed, and the [[shooting of Eleanor Bumpurs]] by police.<ref name=ew>{{cite news|last1=Staskiewicz|first1=Keith|title=Do the Right Thing: 1989|work=Entertainment Weekly|issue=1282/1283|date=October 25, 2013|page=42}}</ref> Lee wrote the screenplay in two weeks.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/fight-the-power-spike-lee-on-do-the-right-thing-20140620 |title= Fight the Power: Spike Lee on 'Do the Right Thing' |magazine= [[Rolling Stone]] |author= Gavin Edwards |date= 20 June 2014  |access-date= 29 April 2015}}</ref> \n\nThe original script of ''Do the Right Thing'' ended with a stronger reconciliation between Mookie and Sal than Lee used in the film. In this version, Sal's comments to Mookie are similar to Da Mayor's earlier comments in the film and hint at some common ground, and perhaps Sal's understanding of why Mookie tried to destroy his restaurant.

Aiello eventually played Sal and his son Rick played Gary Long, the police officer who kills Radio Raheem. The character of Smiley was not in the original script; he was created by [[Roger Guenveur Smith]], who was pestering Lee for a role in the film.<ref>Do The Right Thing DVD Audio Commentary</ref> \n\nFour of the cast members were stand-up comedians: [[Martin Lawrence]], [[Steve Park (comedian)|Steve Park]], [[Steve White (actor)|Steve White]], and [[Robin Harris]]. Lee originally wanted Nunn to play the role of Mister Se\u00f1or Love Daddy, but later recast him as Radio Raheem.

The street's color scheme was altered by the production designer, who used a great deal of red and orange paint to convey the sense of a heatwave. The Korean grocery store and Sal's pizzeria were built from scratch on two empty lots. The pizzeria was fully functional and the actors cooked pizzas in the ovens. During filming, the neighborhood's [[crack cocaine|crack]] dealers threatened the film crew for disturbing their business there.

The appointment is made as the country faces [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Malaysia|COVID-19]] disease.<ref name=\"Malay Mail\"/>\n\n==Controversy==\n===Warm Water Helps Prevent the Spread of Coronavirus===\nOn 19 March 2020, Adham advised the public that drinking warm water will help prevent [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] virus infection as the virus will be flushed down to the stomach and the digestive acids will kill any virus, while being interviewed at [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia|RTM]]'s ''Bicara Naratif'' programme. His remarks later went viral on social media, with many netizens questioning his dubious claim. Dr Nur Amalina Che Bakri had criticised Adham saying that there was no scientific evidence that the stomach's acid can kill the virus.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/20/health-minister039s-039warm-water-method039-to-kill-coronavirus-questioned|title=Health Minister's 'warm water method' to kill coronavirus questioned|work=The Star}}</ref> [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) has also refuted the claim, noting that while staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent the coronavirus infection.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://says.com/my/news/health-minister-wrongly-claims-hot-water-can-kill-coronavirus-because-it-doesn-t-like-heat|title=Health Minister Claims Warm Water Can Kill Coronavirus Because It \"Doesn't Like Heat\"|work=Says}}</ref> Health Director-General Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah later refuted   Adham's statement, commenting that the Health Ministry's approach for patient treatment and management is always based on scientific evidence.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.therakyatpost.com/2020/03/22/health-dg-appears-to-disagree-with-health-minister-on-warm-water-claim/|title=Health DG appears to disagree with Health Minister on Warm Water claim|work=The Rakyat Post}}</ref>\n\n===Pakatan Harapan Blamed for Failing to Contain Tabligh Cluster===\nOn 18 April 2020, Adham in a live-streamed video conference call with [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] President [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]], he erroneously claimed that the previous [[Pakatan Harapan]] government has failed to contain the tabligh cluster happened from 27 February to 3 March, which grew to become a source of the largest [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] infections. Notably, as the tabligh event at Sri Petaling Mosque was held from 27 February to 1 March, Malaysia did not possess any ruling government as the [[Pakatan Harapan]] administration had collapsed due to the [[2020 Malaysian political crisis|political crisis]] caused by the [[Perikatan Nasional]] ruling coalition which came to power without any general election taking place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysias-health-minister-blames-previous-ph-govt-for-failure-to-contain-covid-19-surge|title=Malaysia's Health Minister blames previous PH govt for failure to contain Covid-19 surge|last=|first=|date=2020-04-18|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The Ministry of Health was without any Health Minister until 10 March, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Another important fact that Adham omitted is that the Ministry of Health under the previous health minister Dr. [[Dzulkefly Ahmad]] had prepared for the Covid-19 infections since December 2019, when seven hospitals were planned and identified to treat Covid-19 patients even before the first cases were reported on 25 January 2020. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://says.com/my/news/fact-checking-dr-adham-baba-s-claim-that-previous-govt-failed-to-contain-the-tabligh-covid-19-cluster|title=Fact-Checking Dr Adham Baba's Claim That PH Failed To Contain The Tabligh Cluster|work=Says}}</ref>\n\n===WHO Conference Call with 500 Countries===\nOn 18 April 2020, Adham was ridiculed once again for erroneously claiming that he conducted video-conferencing with 500 countries within the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) members during a Facebook live session with [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] President [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]].

Notably, as the tabligh event at Sri Petaling Mosque was held from 27 February to 1 March, Malaysia did not possess any ruling government as the [[Pakatan Harapan]] administration had collapsed due to the [[2020 Malaysian political crisis|political crisis]] caused by the [[Perikatan Nasional]] ruling coalition which came to power without any general election taking place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysias-health-minister-blames-previous-ph-govt-for-failure-to-contain-covid-19-surge|title=Malaysia's Health Minister blames previous PH govt for failure to contain Covid-19 surge|last=|first=|date=2020-04-18|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The Ministry of Health was without any Health Minister until 10 March, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic in the country.

She was born in Lauben, Germany on December 22, 1847. Her mother supposedly taught her to pickpocket and shoplift and forced her out into the street to steal.

Two years after their marriage, Ned was able to purchase a villa on [[Long Island]] from his share in a major bank robbery. Although he tried to discourage Lyons from pickpocketing, she continued to do so and eventually both were imprisoned. Soon after Ned's escape from prison in 1872, he returned to New York to help Lyons escape from prison by using a disguise to infiltrate [[Sing Sing]] and break through the wall of her jail cell. They escaped to [[Paris]], where Lyons lived under the name Madame d'Varney and the two continued their criminal activities.<ref name=\"Houdini\"/>\n\n===Court battle with George Lyons===\nOn the afternoon of January 31, 1880, Lyons returned to the Essex Market police court where she brought her oldest son, 14-year-old George, before the [[magistrate]]. She claimed he refused to attend school, often left home at nights to sleep in the streets and \"was so generally unruly\" that she requested that he be put in a juvenile [[correctional facility]].\n\nAfter she had finished, George shouted, \"That woman is a thief and a shoplifter. I have seen her steal in [[Montreal]] and elsewhere.\" He denied his mother's charges, claiming she wanted to get rid of him, and that he had \"recommendations showing his good character\". He went on to make further criminal charges against his mother, continuing, \"Yes, you want to get rid of me, and you're my mother.

She also said that her son had obtained at least one of his recommendations by threatening a former employer by the name of Kate B. Woodward with a carving knife.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n\nAfter hearing of this incident, Lyons invited George to her home on [[Avenue C (Manhattan)|Montgomery Street]] and had him arrested by waiting police officers. George admitted that he had an argument with Woodward, who had withheld his [[pocket watch]], but denied intimidating her to obtaining his recommendation. He did admit to picking up a carving knife during the argument, but did not use it towards her or use threatening language. He was reportedly disruptive while his mother made her statement, making claims of [[child neglect]] and [[child abandonment|abandonment]].

Plunkett told the crowd that \"one of the most notorious pickpockets in the world\" was standing before them.

Many theories have been propounded to explain this system. According to the vedic theories, the [[Brahmin]]s are direct descendants of seven sages who are believed to be the sons of Brahma, borne out of his mind through yogic prowess. They are [[Gautama Maharishi]], [[Bharadwaja]], [[Vishvamitra]], [[Jamadagni]], [[Vashista]], [[Kashyapa]] and [[Atri]] . To this list, [[Agastya]] is also sometimes added. These eight sages are called gotrakarins, from whom all 49 gotras (especially of the Brahmins) have evolved.

A kula is equal to a particular family , or equal to modern day \"clans\",  Kula does relate to lineage or ''caste.''\n\n==Marriages and gotras==\nMarriages within the gotra ('sagotra' marriages) are not permitted under the rule of [[exogamy]] in the traditional matrimonial system. The compound word 'sagotra' is a union of the words 'sa' and 'gotra', where 'sa' means same or similar. It is common practice in preparation for [[Hinduism|Hindu]] marriage to inquire about the kula-gotra (meaning clan lineage) of the bride and groom before approving the marriage. People within the gotra are regarded as [[siblings]] and marrying such a person would be thought of as taboo. In almost all Hindu families, marriage within the same gotra is not encouraged or practised since they are believed to be descended from the same family. Marriages between different gotras are therefore encouraged. But marriage within the [[J\u0101ti|jaati]] is allowed and even preferred.\n\nFor example, [[Jats]] and [[Rajputs]] have 3000 Gotras and [[Mudiraju|Mudirajas]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] have 2600 Gotras. Gotra is always passed on from father to children among most Hindus. However, among the [[Malayali]] and [[Tulu people]] it is passed on from mother to child.\n\nThe tatsama words 'sahodara' (brother) and 'sahodari' (sister) derive their roots from the Sanskrit word 'saha udara' (\u0938\u0939\u094b\u0926\u0930) meaning co-uterine or born of the same womb. In communities where gotra membership passed from father to children, marriages were allowed between a woman and her maternal uncle,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/india/86.htm|title=India \u2013 Marriage|work=countrystudies.us|accessdate=24 March 2015}}</ref> while such marriages were forbidden in [[matrilineal]] communities, like [[Thiyyar]]s and [[Tuluva]]s, where gotra membership was passed down from the mother.\n\nA much more common characteristic of South Indian Hindu society is permission for marriage between [[cross-cousin]]s (children of brother and sister) as they are of different gotras. Thus, a man is allowed to marry his maternal uncle's daughter or his paternal aunt's daughter, but is not allowed to marry his paternal uncle's daughter. She would be considered a [[parallel cousin]], of the same gotra, and therefore to be treated as a sister.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://neurologyasia.org/articles/20073_015.pdf|title=Arranged marriage, consanguinity and epilepsy|author=Mehndiratta MM; Paul B and Mehndiratta P|journal=Neurology Asia |year=2007|volume =12 |issue=Supplement 1|pages=15\u201317}}</ref>\n\n[[North Indian]] [[Hindu]] society not only follows the rules of gotra for marriages, but also has many regulations which go beyond the basic definition of gotra and has a broader definition of incest.<ref>[http://anthro.palomar.edu/marriage/marriage_3.htm Sex and Marriage: Marriage Rules (Part 1)]. palomar.edu.</ref> Some communities in North India do not allow marriage with certain other clans, based on the belief that both clans are of the same patrilineal descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/haryana-panchayat-takes-on-govt-over-samegotra-marriage/491548/|title=Haryana panchayat takes on govt over same-gotra marriage|work=indianexpress.com|author=Vashisht, Dinker |date=20 July 2009}}</ref> In other communities, marriage within the gotra of the mother's father, and possibly some others, is prohibited.\n\nA possible workaround for sagotra marriages is to perform a 'Dathu' (adoption) of the bride to a family of different gotra (usually dathu is given to the bride's maternal uncle who belongs to different gotra by the same rule) and let them perform the '[[Kanyadan]]am' ('kanya' (girl) + 'danam' (to give)). Such workarounds are used in rare cases, and the acceptability is questionable.\n\nThe [[Vedic Hinduism]] recognises eight types of marriages, thus predominantly follows the principles as stated in the [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Manu-smriti Manu Smriti], referring to 8 types of marriages, the roles and responsibilities of husband and wife and the purpose of marriage. [[Hindu Marriage|Eight types of marriages]] are, (1) Brahma Vivaha, (2) Arsa Vivaha, (3) Daiva Vivaha, (4) Prajapatya Vivaha, (5) [[Gandharva marriage|Gandharva Vivaha]], (6) Asura Vivaha, (7) Rakshasa Vivaha, and (8) Paishacha Vivaha. The first four types of marriages reflect the paradigm behind arranged marriages. The last three are prohibited as per [[Manu Smriti]], out of which the last two are condemned. The Gandharva marriage is an analogy to the modern day love marriages, where the individuals have the liberty to choose their partners. Though [[Gandharva marriage]] had its due prominence in our Shahstras, but with advancement of time, [[Vedic Hinduism]] giving way to classic Hinduism, the concept of arranged marriage rose to prominence, which till today is predominant [[ritual]] for a marriage between two individuals.\n\nThe Gotra system had significant contribution in preventing genetic abnormalities since its inception thousands of years ago. However, there is no harm in Sagotra marriage, if the individuals are not related to six generations both from maternal and paternal side, as brought out in chapter 5 of Manu smriti at mantra 60, which states, \u0938\u092a\u093f\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0941 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0947 \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0924\u0947 \u0964 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0926\u0915\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0928\u094b\u0930\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0928\u0947, which means that [[sapinda]] ends after seventh generations.<ref>[http://aryamantavya.in/manusmriti/5-60/ Manu Smriti]</ref> Section 5(v) of [[Hindu marriage Act|Hindu Marriage Act 1955]] also prohibits sapinda relationship but there is no restriction of Sagotra marriage. <ref>[http://bokakhat.gov.in/pdf/The_hindu_marriage_act.pdf The Hindu Marriage Act 1955]</ref>\n\nWith nuclear families and large scale migration, in search of job or business opportunities or otherwise, it is possible that one may not know his/her gotra.

The court called the idea of Brahmin families descending from an unbroken line of common ancestors as indicated by the names of their respective gotras \"impossible to accept.\" The court consulted relevant Hindu texts and stressed the need for Hindu society and law to keep up with the times, emphasising that notions of good social behaviour and the general ideology of the Hindu society had changed. The court also said that the mass of material in the Hindu texts is so vast and so full of contradictions that it is a near-impossible task to reduce it to order and coherence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-paradox-of-the-21st-century/article432445.ece|title=The paradox of the 21st century|author=Anand, Pinky |work=The Hindu|date=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aliyasantana]]\n* [[Hindu genealogy registers at Haridwar]]\n* [[Pravaras]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ruegg, D.

She would be considered a [[parallel cousin]], of the same gotra, and therefore to be treated as a sister.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://neurologyasia.org/articles/20073_015.pdf|title=Arranged marriage, consanguinity and epilepsy|author=Mehndiratta MM; Paul B and Mehndiratta P|journal=Neurology Asia |year=2007|volume =12 |issue=Supplement 1|pages=15\u201317}}</ref>\n\n[[North Indian]] [[Hindu]] society not only follows the rules of gotra for marriages, but also has many regulations which go beyond the basic definition of gotra and has a broader definition of incest.<ref>[http://anthro.palomar.edu/marriage/marriage_3.htm Sex and Marriage: Marriage Rules (Part 1)]. palomar.edu.</ref> Some communities in North India do not allow marriage with certain other clans, based on the belief that both clans are of the same patrilineal descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/haryana-panchayat-takes-on-govt-over-samegotra-marriage/491548/|title=Haryana panchayat takes on govt over same-gotra marriage|work=indianexpress.com|author=Vashisht, Dinker |date=20 July 2009}}</ref> In other communities, marriage within the gotra of the mother's father, and possibly some others, is prohibited.\n\nA possible workaround for sagotra marriages is to perform a 'Dathu' (adoption) of the bride to a family of different gotra (usually dathu is given to the bride's maternal uncle who belongs to different gotra by the same rule) and let them perform the '[[Kanyadan]]am' ('kanya' (girl) + 'danam' (to give)). Such workarounds are used in rare cases, and the acceptability is questionable.\n\nThe [[Vedic Hinduism]] recognises eight types of marriages, thus predominantly follows the principles as stated in the [https://www.britannica.com/topic/Manu-smriti Manu Smriti], referring to 8 types of marriages, the roles and responsibilities of husband and wife and the purpose of marriage. [[Hindu Marriage|Eight types of marriages]] are, (1) Brahma Vivaha, (2) Arsa Vivaha, (3) Daiva Vivaha, (4) Prajapatya Vivaha, (5) [[Gandharva marriage|Gandharva Vivaha]], (6) Asura Vivaha, (7) Rakshasa Vivaha, and (8) Paishacha Vivaha. The first four types of marriages reflect the paradigm behind arranged marriages. The last three are prohibited as per [[Manu Smriti]], out of which the last two are condemned. The Gandharva marriage is an analogy to the modern day love marriages, where the individuals have the liberty to choose their partners. Though [[Gandharva marriage]] had its due prominence in our Shahstras, but with advancement of time, [[Vedic Hinduism]] giving way to classic Hinduism, the concept of arranged marriage rose to prominence, which till today is predominant [[ritual]] for a marriage between two individuals.\n\nThe Gotra system had significant contribution in preventing genetic abnormalities since its inception thousands of years ago. However, there is no harm in Sagotra marriage, if the individuals are not related to six generations both from maternal and paternal side, as brought out in chapter 5 of Manu smriti at mantra 60, which states, \u0938\u092a\u093f\u0923\u094d\u0921\u0924\u093e \u0924\u0941 \u092a\u0941\u0930\u0941\u0937\u0947 \u0938\u092a\u094d\u0924\u092e\u0947 \u0935\u093f\u0928\u093f\u0935\u0930\u094d\u0924\u0924\u0947 \u0964 \u0938\u092e\u093e\u0928\u094b\u0926\u0915\u092d\u093e\u0935\u0938\u094d\u0924\u0941 \u091c\u0928\u094d\u092e\u0928\u093e\u092e\u094d\u0928\u094b\u0930\u0935\u0947\u0926\u0928\u0947, which means that [[sapinda]] ends after sixth generations.<ref>[http://aryamantavya.in/manusmriti/5-60/]</ref> Section 5(v) of [[Hindu marriage Act|Hindu Marriage Act 1955]] also prohibits sapinda relationship but there is no restriction of Sagotra marriage. <ref>[http://bokakhat.gov.in/pdf/The_hindu_marriage_act.pdf]</ref>\n\nWith nuclear families and large scale migration, in search of job or business opportunities or otherwise, it is possible that one may not know his/her gotra.

The court called the idea of Brahmin families descending from an unbroken line of common ancestors as indicated by the names of their respective gotras \"impossible to accept.\" The court consulted relevant Hindu texts and stressed the need for Hindu society and law to keep up with the times, emphasising that notions of good social behaviour and the general ideology of the Hindu society had changed. The court also said that the mass of material in the Hindu texts is so vast and so full of contradictions that it is a near-impossible task to reduce it to order and coherence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/the-paradox-of-the-21st-century/article432445.ece|title=The paradox of the 21st century|author=Anand, Pinky |work=The Hindu|date=28 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Aliyasantana]]\n* [[Hindu genealogy registers at Haridwar]]\n* [[Pravaras]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Ruegg, D.

The racial makeup of the county was 95.92% [[Race (United States Census)|White]], 0.13% [[Race (United States Census)|Black]] or [[Race (United States Census)|African American]], 1.42% [[Race (United States Census)|Native American]], 1.73% [[Race (United States Census)|Asian]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Yellow]], 0.02% [[Race (United States Census)|Pacific Islander]], 0.08% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 0.70% from two or more races.  0.43% of the population were [[Race (United States Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Race (United States Census)|Latino]] of any race. 41.0% were of [[norwegian people|Norwegian]], 18.8% [[German people|German]] and 10.7% [[swedish people|Swedish]] ancestry.\n\nThere were 6,190 households out of which 38.40% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 60.00% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 6.80% had a female householder with no husband present, and 28.30% were non-families. 24.60% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.90% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.60 and the average family size was 3.11.\n\nThe county population contained 29.80% under the age of 18, 6.80% from 18 to 24, 29.90% from 25 to 44, 20.80% from 45 to 64, and 12.60% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 35 years. For every 100 females there were 105.00 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 104.00 males.\n\nThe median income for a household in the county was $39,852, and the median income for a family was $46,185. Males had a median income of $29,747 versus $23,630 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the county was $17,053.

[[John McCain]]'s and [[George W. Bush]]'s best performances in Minnesota were in Roseau County. Bush won in Roseau County twice, with over 65% of the vote. It was also one of the few Minnesota counties that [[George H. W. Bush]] won in 1992 and [[Bob Dole]] won in 1996.\n\nRoseau County is less reliably Republican in senatorial and gubernatorial elections. The [[Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] has won two senatorial elections here since 1992. Independents do not perform as well in Roseau County as in the rest of Minnesota. In the 1998 gubernatorial election, [[Norm Coleman]]'s best performance in Minnesota was in Roseau County, where he won with almost 50% of the vote.\n\n{{Hidden begin|titlestyle=background:#ccccff|title= President and Governor Election results '''1972-2016'''}}\n{| align=\"right\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|- style=\"background-color:#E9E9E9\"\n! colspan=\"5\" | Election results from statewide races<ref name=Atlas>{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/|title=Atlas of US Presidential Elections|first=David|last=Leip|website=uselectionatlas.org|accessdate=October 10, 2018}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=\"#EEEEEE\" align=\"center\"\n|Year\n|Office\n!

oldest cities in the Indian state of [[Haryana]]. [[Rani Talab]] is the main destination place for tourists while [[Pandu]]-Pindara and [[Ramrai]] are the most popular religious places, attracting devotees for the holy bath during ''[[Amavasya]]''.\n\nThe fort of Jind was built by [[Sidhu]] [[Jat]] ruler Maharaja Gajpat Singh in 1776 AD. [[Narwana]] and [[Uchana]] are fast-growing towns in Jind.\n\n==Etymology==\nJind was named Jayantapura after the lord of victory [[Indra|Jayant]] (Indra), whom [[Pandava]]s worshipped before the [[Mahabharata]] war. According to the [[oral tradition]], Pandavas built the [[Jayanti Devi Temple]] in honour of Jainti Devi (the goddess of victory, a feminine representation of Indra). They offered prayers for success and then launched the battle against [[Kaurava]]. The town grew up around the temple and was named Jaintapuri (Abode of Jainti Devi) which later on came to be known as Jind.<ref name=harsamvad1>[http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/Haryana%20Samvad%20October%202018.pdf Haryana Samvad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129225259/http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/Haryana%20Samvad%20October%202018.pdf |date=29 November 2018 }}, Oct 2018, p44-46.</ref>\n\nThe youngest Queen of [[Maharaja Ranjeet Singh]] and mother of Prince [[Duleep Singh]] was named after [[Jind Kaur]], who came from the nearby area.\n\n==History==\nMaharaja Gajpat Singh, a great-grandson of Phul Singh and the founder of the [[Phulkian Misl]], established an independent Sikh kingdom by seizing a large tract of the country with Sikh armed forces. This included the territory occupied by the present district of Jind from the Afghan invader and governor Zain Khan in 1763. In 1775, Maharaja established Jind city the capital of the state in 1776. Later, [[Sangrur]] was chosen as the capital of Jind State by Raja Sangat Singh (reigned 1822 to 1834). After independence, [[Jind State]] was merged with the Indian union and the territory of the present district became part of [[Sangrur district]] of [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]] on 15 July 1948. On 1 November 1966, Sangrur district was bifurcated and its Jind and [[Narwana]] [[tehsil]]s were merged to form the Jind district. This was one of the seven districts of the newly formed Haryana state. Jind tehsil was bifurcated to two tehsils: Jind and [[Safidon]] in 1967.<ref name=harsamvad1/>\n\n==Geography==\nJind is located at {{Coord|29.32|N|76.32|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/10/Jind.html |title=Maps, Weather, Videos, and Airports for Jind, India |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 227&nbsp;metres (744&nbsp;feet).\nThe [[Sonipat]] district is located in the east; the southern districts are [[Rohtak]] and [[Bhiwani]]; [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]] is located in the west, and the [[Kaithal]] district is located in the north.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2011}} India [[census]],<ref name=\"censusindia1\">{{cite web|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/PopulationFinder/View_Village_Population.aspx?pcaid=438&category=M.Cl |title=View Population |publisher=Censusindia.gov.in |date= |accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref> Jind city had a population of 166,225.

[[Rani Talab]] is the main destination place for tourists while [[Pandu]]-Pindara and [[Ramrai]] are the most popular religious places, attracting devotees for the holy bath during ''[[Amavasya]]''.\n\nThe fort of Jind was built by [[Sidhu]] [[Jat]] ruler Maharaja Gajpat Singh in 1776 AD. [[Narwana]] and [[Uchana]] are fast-growing towns in Jind.\n\n==Etymology==\nJind was named Jayantapura after the lord of victory [[Indra|Jayant]] (Indra), whom [[Pandava]]s worshipped before the [[mahabharata]] war. According to the [[oral tradition]], Pandavas built the [[Jayanti Devi Temple]] in honour of Jainti Devi (the goddess of victory, a feminine representation of Indra). They offered prayers for success and then launched the battle against [[Kaurava]]. The town grew up around the temple and was named Jaintapuri (Abode of Jainti Devi) which later on came to be known as Jind.<ref name=harsamvad1>[http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/Haryana%20Samvad%20October%202018.pdf Haryana Samvad] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181129225259/http://haryanasamvad.gov.in/store/document/Haryana%20Samvad%20October%202018.pdf |date=29 November 2018 }}, Oct 2018, p44-46.</ref>\n\nThe youngest Queen of [[Maharaja Ranjeet Singh]] and mother of Prince [[Duleep Singh]] was named after [[Jind Kaur]], who came from the nearby area.\n\n==History==\nMaharaja Gajpat Singh, a great-grandson of Phul Singh and the founder of the [[Phulkian Misl]], established an independent Sikh kingdom by seizing a large tract of the country with Sikh armed forces. This included the territory occupied by the present district of Jind from the Afghan invader and governor Zain Khan in 1763. In 1775, Maharaja established Jind city the capital of the state in 1776. Later, [[Sangrur]] was chosen as the capital of Jind State by Raja Sangat Singh (reigned 1822 to 1834). After independence, [[Jind State]] was merged with the Indian union and the territory of the present district became part of [[Sangrur district]] of [[Patiala and East Punjab States Union]] on 15 July 1948. On 1 November 1966, Sangrur district was bifurcated and its Jind and [[Narwana]] [[tehsil]]s were merged to form the Jind district. This was one of the seven districts of the newly formed Haryana state. Jind tehsil was bifurcated to two tehsils: Jind and [[Safidon]] in 1967.<ref name=harsamvad1/>\n\n==Geography==\nJind is located at {{Coord|29.32|N|76.32|E|}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fallingrain.com/world/IN/10/Jind.html |title=Maps, Weather, Videos, and Airports for Jind, India |publisher=Fallingrain.com |date= |accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref> It has an average elevation of 227&nbsp;metres (744&nbsp;feet).\nThe [[Sonipat]] district is located in the east; the southern districts are [[Rohtak]] and [[Bhiwani]]; [[Hisar (city)|Hisar]] is located in the west, and the [[Kaithal]] district is located in the north.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{As of|2011}} India [[census]],<ref name=\"censusindia1\">{{cite web|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/PopulationFinder/View_Village_Population.aspx?pcaid=438&category=M.Cl |title=View Population |publisher=Censusindia.gov.in |date= |accessdate=19 October 2012}}</ref> Jind city had a population of 166,225.

All three had held the world record.  [[Galina Chistyakova]] had set the still standing [[Women's long jump world record progression|world record]] just a few months earlier, breaking up a log jam.  [[Heike Drechsler]] had set the world record, improved it to 7.45m two years earlier and subsequently equalled her record two weeks later.  [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]] equalled the record the following year, the Chistyakova equalled it again earlier in the same competition where she set the new record at {{T&Fcalc|7.52}}.  Chistyakova's Soviet teammates [[Yelena Belevskaya]] and [[Inessa Kravets]] were the #5 and #7 jumpers of all time.  Joyner-Kersee was the reigning [[1987 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's long jump|world champion]] and had set the Olympic record at 7.27m the day before en route to her still standing world record in the [[heptathlon]].  She had to qualify for this final in the midst of that heptathlon.\n\nBattling swirling winds, Drechsler opened with a 6.92m, followed by Joyner-Kersee upping the ante to 7.00m, then as the final jumper of the sequence, Chistyakova opened with 7.11m to take the first round lead.  In the second round, Drechsler improved to 7.06m.  After a JJK foul, Belevskaya took the third position with a 7.04m.  Chistyakova showed up for her second round jump with her jumping knee wrapped.  Her second round jump was tentative and almost 4 feet inferior of her world record.  Drechsler took over the lead with her third round 7.18m, a distance only 9 women in history had ever achieved, but five of them were in the competition.  Joyner-Kersee answered with a 7.16m to take over silver position and push Belevskaya out of the medals.\n\nDrechsler extended her lead to 7.22m in the fourth round.  On advice from her coach and husband [[Bob Kersee]], Joyner-Kersee moved her marks back and went for broke in the fifth round, the result was the {{T&Fcalc|7.40}} winner and new Olympic record.  While Drechsler was able to answer with two commendable efforts, she was unable to improve.

All three had held the world record.  [[Galina Chistyakova]] had set the still standing [[Women's long jump world record progression|world record]] just a few months earlier, breaking up a log jam.  [[Heike Drechsler]] had set the world record, improved it to 7.45m two years earlier and subsequently equalled her record two weeks later.  [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]] equalled the record the following year, the Chistyakova equalled it again earlier in the same competition where she set the new record at {{T&Fcalc|7.52}}.  Chistyakova's Soviet teammates [[Yelena Belevskaya]] and [[Inessa Kravets]] were the #5 and #7 jumpers of all time.  Joyner-Kersee was the reigning [[1987 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Women's long jump|world champion]] and had set the Olympic record at 7.27m the day before en route to her still standing world record in the [[heptathlon]].  She had to qualify for this final in the midst of that heptathlon.\n\nBattling swirling winds, Drechsler opened with a 6.92m, followed by Joyner-Kersee upping the ante to 7.00m, then as the final jumper of the sequence, Chistyakova opened with 7.11m to take the first round lead.  In the second round, Drechsler improved to 7.06m.  After a JJK foul, Belevskaya took the third position with a 7.04m.  Chistyakova showed up for her second round jump with her jumping knee wrapped.  Her second round jump was tentative and almost 4 feet inferior of her world record.  Drechsler took over the lead with her third round 7.18m, a distance only 9 women in history had ever achieved, but five of them were in the competition.  Joyner-Kersee answered with a 7.16m to take over silver position and push Belevskaya out of the medals.\n\nDrechsler extended her lead to 7.22m in the fourth round.  On advice from her coach and husband [[Bob Kersee]], Joyner-Kersee moved her marks back and went for broke in the fifth round, the result was the {{T&Fcalc|7.40}} winner and new Olympic record.  While Drechsler was able to answer with two commendable efforts, she was unable to improve.  Later that same afternoon, she raced to a bronze medal in the [[Athletics at the 1988 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 200 metres|200 metres]], behind Joyner-Kersee's sister in law, [[Florence Griffith Joyner]]'s still standing world record.\n\n==Final==\n{| border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"border-collapse: collapse;

{"title_page": "Al-Amarah, Syria", "text_new": "'''Al-Amara''' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0629}}), also known as '''Al-Amarah Juwaniyyah''', is a prominent neighborhood in [[Damascus|the old city of Damascus]] located a few meters away from [[Omayyade Mosque|The Grand Mosque of Damascus]].\n\n[[File:Amara District.jpg|thumb|right|Amara District in The old City of [[Damascus]]]]\n\n==History==\n[[Damascus]] prides itself on being [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation|the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world]]. The history of Damascus goes back well into 8000 BC. In every corner of its ancient alleys there's a taste of every historical era there was to be found. Amara District is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city. \n[[File:Umayyad Mosque-Minaret of the Bride.jpg|thumb|left|Minarets of The Umayyad Mosque can be spotted almost form every house in the district]]\nIts name derives from the [[Arabic]] word \u201cAmara\u201d which means building, denoting its routes which date back to the founding of Damascus. [[Omayyade Mosque|The Great Mosque of Damascus]] with its stunning [[minaret]]s can be spotted almost form every house in the district and the [[souk]]s of the old city can be reached within minutes.\n\n==Description==\nAs soon as you dive into [[Damascus|the old town]] from any of the entrances from the modern city, you dive into a maze of alleys, a labyrinth of small streets with [[arch]]es, with shops, with mosques and churches, with arches and remnants of the old [[defensive wall]], with restaurants hidden behind small doors. From every corner, the age of the houses dawns on you. It is actually quite easy to imagine that life might not even have been very different here many centuries ago.\n[[File:Map of old damascus.jpg|thumb|right|A map of old [[Damascus]] showing the district]]\nSometimes alleys are so tight that you can just walk inside without touching the walls. Some alleys are covered by [[vine]]s, giving them a distinctly village-like appearance. Despite all the winding little streets, the many side streets and small squares, it is somehow impossible to get lost there - sooner or later you find yourself near one of the landmarks. Stepping back into modern-day Damascus with its traffic is like stepping forward into history.\n\n==Damascene Houses==\n\nAs you stroll through the enchanting neighborhood only simple wooden doors separate you from numerous houses that resemble Arabian palaces with their fabulous facades and roomy entrances. What distinguish these houses from others is more than one thing, the paintings which decorate the walls of these houses are the first thing which make them museums or galleries. Damascene houses in Amara District which are typical of oriental architecture mirrors the social requirements, copes with Islamic traditions, and releases on the raw materials that are found in the [[Ghouta]] \"farms and gardens that were surrounding Damascus\" and overlooking the [[Mount Qasioun|mountains]].\n[[File:Damascusalley.JPG|thumb|right]]\nThose houses look solid and sealed off from the outside, but inside all rooms look on spacious open courtyards with trees planted here and there and a water basin in the center. The rooms are large and comfortable. More often there is a second floor over the ground floor, having windows that open to the marrow streets. A quite family life is enjoyed here amidst lovely ornaments created of gypsum, the hard earth, wood or marble made even more beautiful by inscriptions of Islamic calligraphy or a symphony of color and carved wood which decorate the walls and ceilings. On the walls there are shelves where books or utensils, pots and cups are stored in a manner meant to be decorative.\n\n==Family Life==\n\nThe inhabitants used to be three generation family, their neighbors where most often kinsmen and friends, the alleys are separated by larger gates which open to markets, mosques, bath houses or fountains and schools. In some cases, the second floor of one house protruded over part of the street, and these come so close together that the alley might look like a tunnel.\n\n==Sayyidah Ruqayya Shrine==\n\nLocated nearby is [[Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque|Sayyidah Ruqayya Shrine]] which contains the grave of Sukayna, the infant daughter of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn ibn \u2018Al\u012b]]. The site was built around the mausoleum in 1985 and exhibits the modern style of [[Iranian architecture]], with a tremendous amount of mirror and gold work. There is a small mosque area adjoining the shrine room, along with a small courtyard in front.\n\n==Al-Zahiriyah Library==\nBuilt by [[Baibars|Sultan Baibars]] in 1277, the [[Al-Zahiriyah Library]] was recognized as the national library of Greater Syria for centuries. The decorations, carvings, and writing on the building walls, in addition to the gate which bears geometric designs and patterns, make the library one of the most important historical sites in Damascus.\n\nThe library was nationally recognized by the Syrian state in 1880, and in 1949 a legal deposit law decreed that two copies of every work published in Syria be deposited in al-Zahiriyah National Library.

The plan aimed at tearing down part of the ancient neighborhood of Al-Amara in order to widen the roads outside the walls of the old city. Efforts of the civil society however, succeeded in reverting the disastrous plans in al-Amara.\n\n{{Damascus}}\n{{Municipalities of Damascus|ancient}}\n\n[[Category:Ancient Damascus]]\n[[Category:Streets in Damascus]]\n[[Category:Neighborhoods of Damascus]]\n", "text_old": "'''Al-Amara''' ({{lang-ar|\u0627\u0644\u0639\u0645\u0627\u0631\u0629}}), also known as '''Al-Amarah Juwaniyyah''', is a prominent neighborhood in [[Damascus|the old city of Damascus]] located a few meters away from [[Omayyade Mosque|The Grand Mosque of Damascus]].\n\n[[File:Amara District.jpg|thumb|right|Amara District in The old City of [[Damascus]]]]\n\n==History==\n[[Damascus]] prides itself on being [[List of cities by time of continuous habitation|the oldest continuously inhabited city in the world]]. The history of Damascus goes back well into 8000 BC. In every corner of its ancient alleys there's a taste of every historical era there was to be found. Amara District is one of the oldest neighborhoods in the city. \n[[File:Umayyad Mosque-Minaret of the Bride.jpg|thumb|left|Minarets of The Umayyad Mosque can be spotted almost form every house in the district]]\nIts name derives from the [[Arabic]] word \u201cAmara\u201d which means building, denoting its routes which date back to the founding of Damascus. [[Omayyade Mosque|The Great Mosque of Damascus]] with its stunning [[minaret]]s can be spotted almost form every house in the district and the [[souk]]s of the old city can be reached within minutes.\n\n==Description==\nAs soon as you dive into [[Damascus|the old town]] from any of the entrances from the modern city, you dive into a maze of alleys, a labyrinth of small streets with [[arch]]es, with shops, with mosques and churches, with arches and remnants of the old [[defensive wall]], with restaurants hidden behind small doors. From every corner, the age of the houses dawns on you. It is actually quite easy to imagine that life might not even have been very different here many centuries ago.\n[[File:Map of old damascus.jpg|thumb|right|A map of old [[Damascus]] showing the district]]\nSometimes alleys are so tight that you can just walk inside without touching the walls. Some alleys are covered by [[vine]]s, giving them a distinctly village-like appearance. Despite all the winding little streets, the many side streets and small squares, it is somehow impossible to get lost there - sooner or later you find yourself near one of the landmarks. Stepping back into modern-day Damascus with its traffic is like stepping forward into history.\n\n==Damascene Houses==\n\nAs you stroll through the enchanting neighborhood only simple wooden doors separate you from numerous houses that resemble Arabian palaces with their fabulous facades and roomy entrances. What distinguish these houses from others is more than one thing, the paintings which decorate the walls of these houses are the first thing which make them museums or galleries. Damascene houses in Amara District which are typical of oriental architecture mirrors the social requirements, copes with Islamic traditions, and releases on the raw materials that are found in the [[Ghouta]] \"farms and gardens that were surrounding Damascus\" and overlooking the [[Mount Qasioun|mountains]].\n[[File:Damascusalley.JPG|thumb|right]]\nThose houses look solid and sealed off from the outside, but inside all rooms look on spacious open courtyards with trees planted here and there and a water basin in the center. The rooms are large and comfortable. More often there is a second floor over the ground floor, having windows that open to the marrow streets. A quite family life is enjoyed here amidst lovely ornaments created of gypsum, the hard earth, wood or marble made even more beautiful by inscriptions of Islamic calligraphy or a symphony of color and carved wood which decorate the walls and ceilings. On the walls there are shelves where books or utensils, pots and cups are stored in a manner meant to be decorative.\n\n==Family Life==\n\nThe inhabitants used to be three generation family, their neighbors where most often kinsmen and friends, the alleys are separated by larger gates which open to markets, mosques, bath houses or fountains and schools. In some cases, the second floor of one house protruded over part of the street, and these come so close together that the alley might look like a tunnel.\n\n==Sayyidah Ruqayya Shrine==\n\nLocated nearby is [[Sayyidah Ruqayya Mosque|Sayyidah Ruqayya Shrine]] which contains the grave of Sukayna, the infant daughter of [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn ibn \u2018Al\u012b]]. The site was built around the mausoleum in 1985 and exhibits the modern style of [[Iranian architecture]], with a tremendous amount of mirror and gold work. There is a small mosque area adjoining the shrine room, along with a small courtyard in front.\n\n==Al-Zahiriyah Library==\nBuilt by [[Baibars|Sultan Baibars]] in 1277, the [[Al-Zahiriyah Library]] was recognized as the national library of Greater Syria for centuries. The decorations, carvings, and writing on the building walls, in addition to the gate which bears geometric designs and patterns, make the library one of the most important historical sites in Damascus.\n\nThe library was nationally recognized by the Syrian state in 1880, and in 1949 a legal deposit law decreed that two copies of every work published in Syria be deposited in al-Zahiriyah National Library. Later in July 1983, [[Al-Assad National Library|Al-Assad Library]] replaced Al-Zahiriyah Library as the national library of Syria.\n\n==The People of The District==\n\n[[File:EmirAbdelKader.jpg|thumb|right|Prince Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri lived in Amara District in exile]]\nThe neighborhood has been for centuries home to numerous great personalities and saw the birth, rise and fall of multiple opinion leaders in the region. \nAmong people who have lived in it are Prince [[Abd al-Qadir al-Jaza'iri]], [[Izzat Husrieh]], [[Sheikh Ramadan Deeb]], and [[Kamar Keilani]].\n\n==New Plans==\n\nPlans to destroy decades old shops in the ancient district caused public outrage in early 2008.
