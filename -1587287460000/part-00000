The first compressed air car was invented by a French engineer named [[Guy N\u00e8gre]]. The expansion of compressed air may be used to drive the pistons in a modified piston engine.  Efficiency of operation is gained through the use of environmental heat at normal temperature to warm the otherwise cold expanded air from the storage tank. This non-adiabatic expansion has the potential to greatly increase the efficiency of the machine.  The only exhaust is cold air (\u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C), which could also be used to air condition the car.  The source for air is a pressurized carbon-fiber tank. Air is delivered to the engine via a rather conventional injection system. Unique crank design within the engine increases the time during which the air charge is warmed from ambient sources and a two-stage process allows improved heat transfer rates.\n\n=== Battery-electric ===\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2008}}\n{{Main|Battery electric vehicle|Electric car}}\n[[File:EV1 (6).jpg|thumb|[[General Motors EV1]] [[electric car]].]]\n\n[[Battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs), also known as all-electric vehicles (AEVs), are electric vehicles whose main energy storage is in the chemical energy of batteries. BEVs are the most common form of what is defined by the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) as [[zero emission vehicle]] (ZEV) because they produce no tailpipe emissions at the point of operation. The electrical energy carried on board a BEV to power the motors is obtained from a variety of battery chemistries arranged into battery packs. For additional range genset trailers or pusher trailers are sometimes used, forming a type of hybrid vehicle. Batteries used in electric vehicles include \"flooded\" lead-acid, absorbed glass mat, NiCd, nickel metal hydride, Li-ion, Li-poly and zinc-air batteries.\n\nAttempts at building viable, modern [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered electric vehicles began in the 1950s with the introduction of the first modern ([[transistor]] controlled) electric car \u2013 the [[Henney Kilowatt]], even though the concept was out in the market since 1890. Despite the poor sales of the early battery-powered vehicles, development of various battery-powered vehicles continued through the mid-1990s, with such models as the [[General Motors EV1]] and the [[Toyota RAV4 EV]].\n\n[[File:2018 Nissan Leaf Tekna Front.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nissan Leaf]] is the world's top selling highway-capable all-electric car. The Leaf achieved the milestone of 250,000 units sold globally in December 2016.<ref name=LeafBest250K/>]]\n\nBattery powered cars had primarily used [[lead-acid batteries]] and [[Nickel metal hydride|NiMH batteries]]. Lead-acid batteries' recharge capacity is considerably reduced if they're discharged beyond 75% on a regular basis, making them a less-than-ideal solution. NiMH batteries are a better choice{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}, but are considerably more expensive than lead-acid. [[Lithium-ion battery]] powered vehicles such as the [[Venturi Fetish]] and the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]] have recently demonstrated excellent performance and range, and nevertheless is used in most mass production models launched since December 2010.\n\nExpanding on traditional Lithium-ion batteries predominately used in today's battery electric vehicles, is an emerging science that is paving the way to utilize a carbon fiber structure (a vehicle body or chassis in this case) as a structural battery. Experiments being conducted at the [https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/ims/news/Pages/carbon-fibre-can-store-energy.aspx Chalmers University of Technology] in Sweden are showing that when coupled with Lithium-ion insertion mechanisms, an enhanced carbon fiber structure can have electromechanical properties. This means that the carbon fiber structure itself can act as its own battery/power source for propulsion. This would negate the need for traditional heavy battery banks, reducing weight and therefore increasing fuel efficiency.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fredi|first=Giulia|last2=Jeschke|first2=Steffen|last3=Boulaoued|first3=Athmane|last4=Wallenstein|first4=Joachim|last5=Rashidi|first5=Masoud|last6=Liu|first6=Fang|last7=Harnden|first7=Ross|last8=Zenkert|first8=Dan|last9=Hagberg|first9=Johan|last10=Lindbergh|first10=G\u00f6ran|last11=Johansson|first11=Patrik|date=2018-08-28|title=Graphitic microstructure and performance of carbon fibre Li-ion structural battery electrodes|journal=Multifunctional Materials|volume=1|issue=1|pages=015003|doi=10.1088/2399-7532/aab707|issn=2399-7532}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2015|12}}, several [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, [[city car|city electric cars]] and [[series production]] highway-capable [[electric car]]s and utility vans have been made available for retails sales, including Tesla Roadster, [[Global Electric Motorcars|GEM cars]], [[Buddy (electric car)|Buddy]], [[Mitsubishi i MiEV]] and its rebadged versions Peugeot iOn and Citro\u00ebn C-Zero, [[Chery QQ3 EV]], [[JAC J3 EV]], [[Nissan Leaf]], [[Smart ED]], [[Mia electric]], [[BYD e6]], [[Renault Kangoo Z.E.]], [[Bollor\u00e9 Bluecar]], [[Renault Fluence Z.E.]], [[Ford Focus Electric]], [[BMW ActiveE]], [[Renault Twizy]], [[Tesla Model S]], [[Honda Fit EV]], [[Toyota RAV4 EV#Second generation|RAV4 EV second generation]], [[Renault Zoe]], [[Mitsubishi Minicab MiEV]], [[Roewe E50]], [[Chevrolet Spark EV]], [[Fiat 500e]], [[BMW i3]], [[Volkswagen e-Up!]], [[Nissan e-NV200]], [[Volkswagen e-Golf]], [[Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive]], [[Kia Soul EV]], [[BYD e5]], and [[Tesla Model X]].<ref name=\"PEVTracker\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pluginamerica.org/vehicles|title=Plug-in Vehicle Tracker: What's Coming, When|publisher=[[Plug In America]]|accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref> The world's all-time top selling highway legal electric car is the [[Nissan Leaf]], released in December 2010, with global sales of more than 250,000 units through December 2016.<ref name=\"LeafBest250K\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hybridcars.com/nissans-quarter-millionth-leaf-means-its-the-best-selling-plug-in-car-in-history/ |title= Nissan's Quarter-Millionth Leaf Means It's The Best-Selling Plug-in Car In History | first= Jeff | last=Cobb | work= HybridCars.com | date=2017-01-09 |accessdate=2017-01-10}} ''{{As of|2016|12}}, the Nissan Leaf is the world's best-selling plug-in car in history with more than 250,000 units delivered, followed by the Tesla Model S with over 158,000 sales (which may soon replace the Nissan Leaf in most EV sales), the Volt/Ampera family of vehicles  with 134,500 vehicles sold, and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV with about 116,500 units sold through November 2016.

Solar panels cannot currently be used to directly supply a car with a suitable amount of power at this time, but they can be used to extend the range of electric vehicles. They are raced in competitions such as the World Solar Challenge and the North American Solar Challenge. These events are often sponsored by Government agencies such as the United States Department of Energy keen to promote the development of [[alternative energy]] technology such as solar cells and electric vehicles. Such challenges are often entered by universities to develop their students engineering and technological skills as well as motor vehicle manufacturers such as GM and Honda.\n[[Image:Trev solar car.png|thumb|left|200px| Trev's battery lasts over 250,000 kilometres.]]\n\nThe [[North American Solar Challenge]] is a solar car race across North America. Originally called Sunrayce, organized and sponsored by General Motors in 1990, it was renamed American Solar Challenge in 2001, sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Teams from universities in the United States and Canada compete in a long distance test of endurance as well as efficiency, driving thousands of miles on regular highways.\n\n[[Nuna]] is the name of a series of manned solar powered vehicles that won the World solar challenge in Australia three times in a row, in 2001 (Nuna 1 or just Nuna), 2003 (Nuna 2) and 2005 (Nuna 3). The Nunas are built by students of the Delft University of Technology.\n\nThe [[World solar challenge]] is a solar powered car race over {{convert|3021|km|mi}} through central Australia from Darwin to Adelaide. The race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations although some are fielded by high schools.\n\nTrev (two-seater [[renewable energy]] vehicle) was designed by the staff and students at the University of South Australia. Trev was first displayed at the 2005 World Solar Challenge as the concept of a low-mass, efficient commuter car. With 3 wheels and a mass of about 300&nbsp;kg, the prototype car had maximum speed of 120&nbsp;km/h and acceleration of 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h in about 10 seconds.

This makes Diesel engines capable of achieving much better fuel economy than gasoline vehicles.\n\n[[Biodiesel]] (Fatty acid methyl ester), is commercially available in most oilseed-producing states in the United States. As of 2005, it is somewhat more expensive than fossil diesel, though it is still commonly produced in relatively small quantities (in comparison to petroleum products and ethanol). Many farmers who raise oilseeds use a biodiesel blend in tractors and equipment as a matter of policy, to foster production of biodiesel and raise public awareness. It is sometimes easier to find biodiesel in rural areas than in cities. Biodiesel has lower [[Energy Density]] than fossil diesel fuel, so biodiesel vehicles are not quite able to keep up with the fuel economy of a fossil fuelled diesel vehicle, if the diesel injection system is not reset for the new fuel. If the injection timing is changed to take account of the higher Cetane value of biodiesel, the difference in economy is negligible. Because biodiesel contains more oxygen than diesel or [[vegetable oil fuel]], it produces the lowest emissions from diesel engines, and is lower in most emissions than gasoline engines. Biodiesel has a higher lubricity than mineral diesel and is an additive in European pump diesel for lubricity and emissions reduction.\n\nSome [[Diesel fuel|Diesel]]-powered cars can run with minor modifications on 100% pure [[vegetable oil]]s. Vegetable oils tend to thicken (or solidify if it is waste cooking oil), in cold weather conditions so vehicle modifications (a two tank system with diesel start/stop tank), are essential in order to heat the fuel prior to use under most circumstances.  Heating to the temperature of engine coolant reduces fuel viscosity, to the range cited by injection system manufacturers, for systems prior to 'common rail' or 'unit injection ( VW PD)' systems. Waste vegetable oil, especially if it has been used for a long time, may become hydrogenated and have increased acidity. This can cause the thickening of fuel, gumming in the engine and acid damage of the fuel system. Biodiesel does not have this problem, because it is chemically processed to be PH neutral and lower viscosity. Modern low emission diesels (most often Euro -3 and -4 compliant), typical of the current production in the European industry, would require extensive modification of injector system, pumps and seals etc. due to the higher operating pressures, that are designed thinner (heated) mineral diesel than ever before, for atomisation, if they were to use pure vegetable oil as fuel. Vegetable oil fuel is not suitable for these vehicles as they are currently produced. This reduces the market as increasing numbers of new vehicles are not able to use it. However, the German Elsbett company has successfully produced single tank vegetable oil fuel systems for several decades, and has worked with Volkswagen on their TDI engines. This shows that it is technologically possible to use vegetable oil as a fuel in high efficiency / low emission diesel engines.\n\n[[Greasestock]] is an event held yearly in [[Yorktown Heights, New York]], and is one of the largest showcases of vehicles using waste oil as a biofuel in the United States.<ref>Norman, Jim. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/automobiles/13GREASE.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin Where There\u2019s Never an Oil Shortage]\".

These cars generally use the hydrogen in one of two methods: combustion or [[fuel-cell]] conversion. In combustion, the hydrogen is \"burned\" in engines in fundamentally the same method as traditional gasoline cars. In fuel-cell conversion, the hydrogen is turned into electricity through fuel cells which then powers electric motors. With either method, the only byproduct from the spent hydrogen is water, however during combustion with air [[NOx]] can be produced.\n\n[[Honda]] introduced its fuel cell vehicle in 1999 called the [[Honda FCX|FCX]] and have since then introduced the second generation [[Honda FCX Clarity|FCX Clarity]].

The common [[internal combustion engine]], usually fueled with gasoline (petrol) or [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] liquids, can be converted to run on gaseous hydrogen.  However, the most efficient use of hydrogen involves the use of [[fuel cell]]s and [[electric motor]]s instead of a traditional engine.  Hydrogen reacts with [[oxygen]] inside the fuel cells, which produces electricity to power the motors.  One primary area of research is [[hydrogen storage]], to try to increase the range of hydrogen vehicles while reducing the weight, [[energy consumption]], and complexity of the storage systems.  Two primary methods of storage are metal hydrides and compression.  Some believe that hydrogen cars will never be economically viable and that the emphasis on this technology is a diversion from the development and popularization of more efficient hybrid cars and other alternative technologies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nA study by [[The Carbon Trust]] for the UK [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] suggests that hydrogen technologies have the potential to deliver UK transport with near-zero emissions whilst reducing dependence on imported oil and curtailment of renewable generation.

A limited series production of the 7 Series Saloon was announced as commencing at the end of 2006. A BMW hydrogen prototype (H2R) using the driveline of this model broke the speed record for hydrogen cars at 300&nbsp;km/h (186&nbsp;mi/h), making automotive history. Mazda has developed Wankel engines to burn hydrogen. The Wankel uses a rotary principle of operation, so the hydrogen burns in a different part of the engine from the intake. This reduces pre-detonation, a problem with hydrogen fueled piston engines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe other major car companies like Daimler, Chrysler, Honda, Toyota, Ford and General Motors, are investing in hydrogen fuel cells instead. VW, Nissan, and Hyundai/Kia also have fuel cell vehicle prototypes on the road. In addition, transit agencies across the globe are running prototype fuel cell buses.

Energy is used to liquefy air, and then LN2 is produced by evaporation, and distributed. LN2 is exposed to ambient heat in the car and the resulting nitrogen gas can be used to power a piston or turbine engine. The maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from LN2 is 213 Watt-hours per kg (W\u00b7h/kg) or 173 W\u00b7h per liter, in which a maximum of 70 W\u00b7h/kg can be utilized with an isothermal expansion process. Such a vehicle with a 350-liter (93 gallon) tank can achieve ranges similar to a gasoline powered vehicle with a 50-liter (13 gallon) tank. Theoretical future engines, using cascading topping cycles, can improve this to around 110 W\u00b7h/kg with a quasi-isothermal expansion process. The advantages are zero harmful emissions and superior energy densities compared to a [[Compressed-air vehicle]] as well as being able to refill the tank in a matter of minutes.\n\n=== Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) ===\n{{Main|Natural gas vehicle}}\n[[Liquefied natural gas]] is natural gas that has been cooled to a point at which it becomes a [[cryogenic]] liquid. In this liquid state, natural gas is more than 2 times as dense as highly compressed CNG. LNG fuel systems function on any vehicle capable of burning natural gas. Unlike CNG, which is stored at high pressure (typically 3000 or 3600 psi) and then regulated to a lower pressure that the engine can accept, LNG is stored at low pressure (50 to 150 psi) and simply vaporized by a heat exchanger before entering the fuel metering devices to the engine. Because of its high energy density compared to CNG, it is very suitable for those interested in long ranges while running on natural gas.\n\nIn the United States, the LNG supply chain is the main thing that has held back this fuel source from growing rapidly. The LNG supply chain is very analogous to that of diesel or gasoline. First, pipeline natural gas is liquefied in large quantities, which is analogous to refining gasoline or diesel. Then, the LNG is transported via semi trailer to fuel stations where it is stored in bulk tanks until it is dispensed into a vehicle. CNG, on the other hand, requires expensive compression at each station to fill the high-pressure cylinder cascades.\n\n=== Autogas (LPG) ===\n{{Main|Autogas}}\n[[File:Propane powered blue bird vision.jpg|thumb|right|A propane-fueled [[school bus]] in the United States.]]\nLPG or [[liquefied petroleum gas]] is a low pressure liquefied gas mixture composed mainly of propane and butane which burns in conventional gasoline combustion engines with less CO<sub>2</sub> than gasoline. Gasoline cars can be retrofitted to LPG aka Autogas and become bifuel vehicles as the gasoline tank stays. You can switch between LPG and gasoline during operation. Estimated 10 million vehicles running worldwide.\n\nThere are 17.473 million LPG powered vehicles worldwide as of December 2010, and the leading countries are Turkey (2.394 million vehicles), Poland (2.325 million), and South Korea (2.3 million).<ref name=LPG>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldlpgas.com/autogas/the-autogas-market |title=WLPGA: The Autogas Market |publisher=World LP Gas Association |accessdate=2012-02-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419182640/http://www.worldlpgas.com/autogas/the-autogas-market |archivedate=2013-04-19 }} See table: Largest autogas markets, 2010</ref> In the U.S., 190,000 on-road vehicles use propane,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://e85.whipnet.net/alt.fuel/propane.faq.html|title=Propane FAQ|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref> and 450,000 forklifts use it for power.

Wood, coal, [[ethanol]], or others can be used as [[fuel]]. The fuel is burned in a [[boiler]] and the heat converts water into [[steam]]. When the water turns to steam, it expands. The expansion creates [[pressure]]. The pressure pushes the [[piston]]s back and forth. This turns the [[driveshaft]] to spin the wheels forward. It works like a coal-fueled [[steam train]], or [[steam boat]]. The steam car was the next logical step in independent transport.\n\nSteam cars take a long time to start, but some can reach speeds over 100&nbsp;mph (161&nbsp;km/h) eventually.  The late model [[Doble steam car|Doble Steam Cars]] could be brought to operational condition in less than 30 seconds, had high top speeds and fast acceleration, but were expensive to buy.\n\nA steam engine uses [[external combustion]], as opposed to internal combustion. Gasoline-powered cars are more efficient at about 25\u201328% [[Fuel efficiency|efficiency]]. In theory, a [[combined cycle]] steam engine in which the burning material is first used to drive a [[gas turbine]] can produce 50% to 60% efficiency. However, practical examples of steam engined cars work at only around 5\u20138% efficiency.\n\nThe best known and best selling steam-powered car was the [[Stanley Steamer]]. It used a compact fire-tube boiler under the hood to power a simple two-piston engine which was connected directly to the rear axle. Before [[Henry Ford]] introduced monthly payment financing with great success, cars were typically purchased outright. This is why the Stanley was kept simple; to keep the purchase price affordable.\n\nSteam produced in [[refrigeration]] also can be use by a [[turbine]] in other vehicle types to produce electricity, that can be employed in electric motors or stored in a battery.\n\nSteam power can be combined with a standard oil-based engine to create a hybrid. Water is injected into the cylinder after the fuel is burned, when the piston is still superheated, often at temperatures of 1500 degrees or more. The water will instantly be vaporized into steam, taking advantage of the heat that would otherwise be wasted.\n\n=== Wood gas ===\n[[Image:Gasogenog.jpg|thumb|200px|Vehicle with a gasifier]]\n{{Main|Wood gas generator}}\n[[Wood gas]] can be used to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines if a [[wood gasifier]] is attached. This was quite popular during World War II in several European and Asian countries because the war prevented easy and cost-effective access to oil.\n{{clear}}\nHerb Hartman of Woodward, Iowa currently drives a wood powered Cadillac. He claims to have attached the gasifier to the Cadillac for just $700. Hartman claims, \u201cA full hopper will go about fifty miles depending on how you drive it,\u201d and he added that splitting the wood was \u201clabor-intensive.

These vehicles are [[colloquial]]ly called '''flex-fuel''', or '''flexifuel''' in Europe, or just flex in Brazil. FFVs are distinguished from [[bi-fuel vehicle]]s, where two fuels are stored in separate tanks. The most common commercially available FFV in the world market is the [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] [[flexible-fuel vehicle]], with the major markets concentrated in the United States, Brazil, Sweden, and some other European countries. In addition to flex-fuel vehicles running with [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]], in the US and Europe there were successful test programs with [[methanol fuel|methanol]] flex-fuel vehicles, known as [[methanol fuel#Methanol fuel programs in the U.S. and other nations|M85 FFVs]], and more recently there have been also successful tests using [[p-series fuels]] with E85 flex fuel vehicles, but as of June 2008, this fuel is not yet available to the general public.\n\nEthanol flexible-fuel vehicles have standard gasoline engines that are capable of running with [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] and gasoline mixed in the same tank.  These mixtures have \"E\" numbers which describe the percentage of ethanol in the mixture, for example, E85 is 85% ethanol and 15% gasoline.

Originally, the sensors were mounted in the fuel line and exhaust system; more recent models do away with the fuel line sensor. Another feature of older flex-fuel cars is a small separate gasoline storage tank that was used for starting the car on cold days, when the ethanol mixture made ignition more difficult.\n[[File:3 Views Honda Flex Titan CG 150 Mix Fuel Injection 06 2009 Itu.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Honda]] [[CG 150 Titan Mix]] was the first flex-fuel motorcycle launched to the market in the world.]]\nModern [[Brazil]]ian flex-fuel technology enables FFVs to run an any blend between [[w:common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20|E20-E25]] [[gasohol]] and [[Neat alcohol fuel|E100 ethanol fuel]], using a [[oxygen sensor|lambda probe]] to measure the quality of combustion, which informs the [[engine control unit]] as to the exact composition of the gasoline-alcohol mixture.

This analysis allows ranking the energy conversion processes along the vehicle fuels production routes and their end-use, so that the best options for the transportation sector can be determined and better energy policies may be issued. Thus, if a drastic CO2 emissions abatement of the transportation sector is pursued, a more intensive utilization of ethanol in the Brazilian transportation sector mix is advisable. However, as the overall exergy conversion efficiency of the sugar cane industry is still very low, which increases the unit energy cost of ethanol, better production and end-use technologies are required. Nonetheless, with the current scenario of a predominantly renewable Brazilian electricity mix, based on more than 80% of renewable sources, this source consolidates as the most promising energy source to reduce the large amount of greenhouse gas emissions which transportation sector is responsible for.<ref name=\"Fl\u00f3rez-OrregoSilva2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Fl\u00f3rez-Orrego|first1=Daniel|last2=Silva|first2=Julio A.M.|last3=Oliveira Jr.|first3=Silvio de|title=Exergy and environmental comparison of the end use of vehicle fuels: The Brazilian case|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|volume=100|year=2015|pages=220\u2013231|issn=0196-8904|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2015.04.074|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Energy}}\n*[[Alternative Fuels Training Consortium]]\n*[[Alternatives to the automobile]]\n*[[Butanol fuel]]\n*[[Clean Cities]]\n*[[Engine control unit|Engine control unit altering to optimize running on different fuels]] \n*[[Green vehicle]]\n*[[Fuel gas-powered scooter]]\n*[[Hydrogen vehicle]]\n*[[List of hybrid vehicles]]\n*[[Solar-charged vehicle]]\n*[[The Hype about Hydrogen]]\n*[[Water-fuelled car]]\n*[[Jack Talbert]] (Vaporization)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://greet.es.anl.gov/publication-c2g-2016-report  Cradle-to-Grave Lifecycle Analysis of U.S. Light-Duty Vehicle-Fuel Pathways: A Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Economic Assessment of Current (2015) and Future (2025\u20132030) Technologies] (includes estimated cost of avoided GHG emissions from different AFV technologies), [[Argonne National Laboratory]], June 2016.\n*[https://afdc.energy.gov/ Official website of the Alternative Fuels Data Center], [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]], [[United States Department of Energy]]\n* [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18264 Transitions to Alternative Vehicles and Fuels], [[National Academy of Sciences]] (2013)  {{ISBN|978-0-309-26852-3}}\n\n{{Alternative propulsion}}\n{{Automobile configuration}}\n{{Emerging technologies|transport=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alternative Fuel Vehicle}}\n[[Category:Vehicle technology]]\n[[Category:Green vehicles]]\n[[Category:Emerging technologies]]\n[[Category:Alternative fuels]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple image|direction=vertical|align=right|image1=2019 Toyota Prius (ZVW50R) 1.8 Hybrid liftback (2018-12-19) 01.jpg\n|image2=Piracicaba 10 2008 151 Gast station selling four fuels.jpg|image3=Volt charging station.jpg|width=220|caption1=The [[Toyota Prius]] is the world's top selling [[hybrid electric vehicle]], with global sales of almost 4&nbsp;million units through January 2017.<ref name=TMC10miHEVs>{{cite press release | title=Worldwide Sales of Toyota Hybrids Surpass 10 Million Units |url=http://newsroom.toyota.eu/global-sales-of-toyota-hybrids-reach-10-million/ | publisher=Toyota |location=[[Toyota City, Japan]] |date=2017-01-14 |accessdate=2017-01-15 |quote=This latest milestone of 10 million units was achieved just nine months after total sales reached 9 million units at the end of April 2016.}}</ref> |caption2=A [[Brazil]]ian filling station with four alternative fuels for sale: [[biodiesel]] (B3), [[gasohol]] (E25), neat [[ethanol fuel|ethanol]] ([[Neat alcohol fuel|E100]]), and [[compressed natural gas]] (CNG).|caption3=The [[Chevrolet Volt]] family is the world's top selling [[plug-in hybrid]], with global sales of about 134,500 units {{as of|2016|12|lc=y}}.<ref name=Top10PEVs2016/>}}\n\nAn '''alternative fuel vehicle''' is a [[motor vehicle]] that runs on a fuel other than traditional [[petroleum fuel]]s ([[petrol]] or [[Diesel fuel]]); and also refers to any technology of powering an engine that does not involve solely [[petroleum]] (e.g. [[electric car]], [[hybrid electric vehicle]]s, solar powered).

The first compressed air car was invented by a French engineer named [[Guy N\u00e8gre]]. The expansion of compressed air may be used to drive the pistons in a modified piston engine.  Efficiency of operation is gained through the use of environmental heat at normal temperature to warm the otherwise cold expanded air from the storage tank. This non-adiabatic expansion has the potential to greatly increase the efficiency of the machine.  The only exhaust is cold air (\u221215&nbsp;\u00b0C), which could also be used to air condition the car.  The source for air is a pressurized carbon-fiber tank. Air is delivered to the engine via a rather conventional injection system. Unique crank design within the engine increases the time during which the air charge is warmed from ambient sources and a two-stage process allows improved heat transfer rates.\n\n=== Battery-electric ===\n{{More citations needed|date=September 2008}}\n{{Main|Battery electric vehicle|Electric car}}\n[[File:EV1 (6).jpg|thumb|[[General Motors EV1]] [[electric car]].]]\n\n[[Battery electric vehicle]]s (BEVs), also known as all-electric vehicles (AEVs), are electric vehicles whose main energy storage is in the chemical energy of batteries. BEVs are the most common form of what is defined by the [[California Air Resources Board]] (CARB) as [[zero emission vehicle]] (ZEV) because they produce no tailpipe emissions at the point of operation. The electrical energy carried on board a BEV to power the motors is obtained from a variety of battery chemistries arranged into battery packs. For additional range genset trailers or pusher trailers are sometimes used, forming a type of hybrid vehicle. Batteries used in electric vehicles include \"flooded\" lead-acid, absorbed glass mat, NiCd, nickel metal hydride, Li-ion, Li-poly and zinc-air batteries.\n\nAttempts at building viable, modern [[battery (electricity)|battery]]-powered electric vehicles began in the 1950s with the introduction of the first modern ([[transistor]] controlled) electric car \u2013 the [[Henney Kilowatt]], even though the concept was out in the market since 1890. Despite the poor sales of the early battery-powered vehicles, development of various battery-powered vehicles continued through the mid-1990s, with such models as the [[General Motors EV1]] and the [[Toyota RAV4 EV]].\n\n[[File:2018 Nissan Leaf Tekna Front.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Nissan Leaf]] is the world's top selling highway-capable all-electric car.

Lead-acid batteries' recharge capacity is considerably reduced if they're discharged beyond 75% on a regular basis, making them a less-than-ideal solution. NiMH batteries are a better choice{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}, but are considerably more expensive than lead-acid. [[Lithium-ion battery]] powered vehicles such as the [[Venturi Fetish]] and the [[Tesla Roadster (2008)|Tesla Roadster]] have recently demonstrated excellent performance and range, and nevertheless is used in most mass production models launched since December 2010.\n\nExpanding on traditional Lithium-ion batteries predominately used in today's battery electric vehicles, is an emerging science that is paving the way to utilize a carbon fiber structure (a vehicle body or chassis in this case) as a structural battery. Experiments being conducted at the [https://www.chalmers.se/en/departments/ims/news/Pages/carbon-fibre-can-store-energy.aspx Chalmers University of Technology] in Sweden are showing that when coupled with Lithium-ion insertion mechanisms, an enhanced carbon fiber structure can have electromechanical properties. This means that the carbon fiber structure itself can act as its own battery/power source for propulsion. This would negate the need for traditional heavy battery banks, reducing weight and therefor increasing fuel efficiency.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fredi|first=Giulia|last2=Jeschke|first2=Steffen|last3=Boulaoued|first3=Athmane|last4=Wallenstein|first4=Joachim|last5=Rashidi|first5=Masoud|last6=Liu|first6=Fang|last7=Harnden|first7=Ross|last8=Zenkert|first8=Dan|last9=Hagberg|first9=Johan|last10=Lindbergh|first10=G\u00f6ran|last11=Johansson|first11=Patrik|date=2018-08-28|title=Graphitic microstructure and performance of carbon fibre Li-ion structural battery electrodes|journal=Multifunctional Materials|volume=1|issue=1|pages=015003|doi=10.1088/2399-7532/aab707|issn=2399-7532}}</ref>\n\n{{As of|2015|12}}, several [[neighborhood electric vehicle]]s, [[city car|city electric cars]] and [[series production]] highway-capable [[electric car]]s and utility vans have been made available for retails sales, including Tesla Roadster, [[Global Electric Motorcars|GEM cars]], [[Buddy (electric car)|Buddy]], [[Mitsubishi i MiEV]] and its rebadged versions Peugeot iOn and Citro\u00ebn C-Zero, [[Chery QQ3 EV]], [[JAC J3 EV]], [[Nissan Leaf]], [[Smart ED]], [[Mia electric]], [[BYD e6]], [[Renault Kangoo Z.E.]], [[Bollor\u00e9 Bluecar]], [[Renault Fluence Z.E.]], [[Ford Focus Electric]], [[BMW ActiveE]], [[Renault Twizy]], [[Tesla Model S]], [[Honda Fit EV]], [[Toyota RAV4 EV#Second generation|RAV4 EV second generation]], [[Renault Zoe]], [[Mitsubishi Minicab MiEV]], [[Roewe E50]], [[Chevrolet Spark EV]], [[Fiat 500e]], [[BMW i3]], [[Volkswagen e-Up!]], [[Nissan e-NV200]], [[Volkswagen e-Golf]], [[Mercedes-Benz B-Class Electric Drive]], [[Kia Soul EV]], [[BYD e5]], and [[Tesla Model X]].<ref name=\"PEVTracker\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pluginamerica.org/vehicles|title=Plug-in Vehicle Tracker: What's Coming, When|publisher=[[Plug In America]]|accessdate=2012-01-15}}</ref> The world's all-time top selling highway legal electric car is the [[Nissan Leaf]], released in December 2010, with global sales of more than 250,000 units through December 2016.<ref name=\"LeafBest250K\">{{cite news | url=http://www.hybridcars.com/nissans-quarter-millionth-leaf-means-its-the-best-selling-plug-in-car-in-history/ |title= Nissan's Quarter-Millionth Leaf Means It's The Best-Selling Plug-in Car In History | first= Jeff | last=Cobb | work= HybridCars.com | date=2017-01-09 |accessdate=2017-01-10}} ''{{As of|2016|12}}, the Nissan Leaf is the world's best-selling plug-in car in history with more than 250,000 units delivered, followed by the Tesla Model S with over 158,000 sales (which may soon replace the Nissan Leaf in most EV sales), the Volt/Ampera family of vehicles  with 134,500 vehicles sold, and the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV with about 116,500 units sold through November 2016.

Solar panels cannot currently be used to directly supply a car with a suitable amount of power at this time, but they can be used to extend the range of electric vehicles. They are raced in competitions such as the World Solar Challenge and the North American Solar Challenge. These events are often sponsored by Government agencies such as the United States Department of Energy keen to promote the development of [[alternative energy]] technology such as solar cells and electric vehicles. Such challenges are often entered by universities to develop their students engineering and technological skills as well as motor vehicle manufacturers such as GM and Honda.\n[[Image:Trev solar car.png|thumb|left|200px| Trev's battery lasts over 250,000 kilometres.]]\n\nThe [[North American Solar Challenge]] is a solar car race across North America. Originally called Sunrayce, organized and sponsored by General Motors in 1990, it was renamed American Solar Challenge in 2001, sponsored by the United States Department of Energy and the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  Teams from universities in the United States and Canada compete in a long distance test of endurance as well as efficiency, driving thousands of miles on regular highways.\n\n[[Nuna]] is the name of a series of manned solar powered vehicles that won the World solar challenge in Australia three times in a row, in 2001 (Nuna 1 or just Nuna), 2003 (Nuna 2) and 2005 (Nuna 3). The Nunas are built by students of the Delft University of Technology.\n\nThe [[World solar challenge]] is a solar powered car race over {{convert|3021|km|mi}} through central Australia from Darwin to Adelaide. The race attracts teams from around the world, most of which are fielded by universities or corporations although some are fielded by high schools.\n\nTrev (two-seater [[renewable energy]] vehicle) was designed by the staff and students at the University of South Australia. Trev was first displayed at the 2005 World Solar Challenge as the concept of a low-mass, efficient commuter car. With 3 wheels and a mass of about 300&nbsp;kg, the prototype car had maximum speed of 120&nbsp;km/h and acceleration of 0\u2013100&nbsp;km/h in about 10 seconds. The running cost of Trev is projected to be less than 1/10 of the running cost of a small petrol car.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Dimethyl ether fuel===\n[[File:Chemrec 5 - small.JPG|thumb|left|Installation of BioDME synthesis towers at Chemrec's pilot facility]]\n\n[[Dimethyl ether]] (DME) is a promising fuel in [[diesel engines]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nykomb.se/index.php?s=Chemicals|title=nycomb.se, Nycomb Chemicals company|accessdate=26 July 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080603115705/http://www.nykomb.se/index.php?s=Chemicals|archivedate=3 June 2008}}</ref> [[petrol engine]]s (30% DME / 70% LPG), and [[gas turbines]] owing to its high [[cetane number]], which is 55, compared to diesel's, which is 40\u201353.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.topsoe.com/site.nsf/all/BBNN-5PNJ3F?OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-11-04 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008100421/http://www.topsoe.com/site.nsf/all/BBNN-5PNJ3F?OpenDocument |archivedate=2007-10-08 }} topsoe.com</ref><ref name=\"SemelsbergerBorup2006\">{{cite journal|title=Dimethyl ether (DME) as an alternative fuel |issn=0378-7753 |doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2005.05.082 |volume=156|issue=2|journal=Journal of Power Sources|pages=497\u2013511|year=2006|last1=Semelsberger|first1=Troy A|last2=Borup|first2=Rodney L|last3=Greene|first3=Howard L|bibcode = 2006JPS...156..497S|ref=harv}}</ref> Only moderate modifications are needed to convert a diesel engine to burn DME.

This makes Diesel engines capable of achieving much better fuel economy than gasoline vehicles.\n\n[[Biodiesel]] (Fatty acid methyl ester), is commercially available in most oilseed-producing states in the United States. As of 2005, it is somewhat more expensive than fossil diesel, though it is still commonly produced in relatively small quantities (in comparison to petroleum products and ethanol). Many farmers who raise oilseeds use a biodiesel blend in tractors and equipment as a matter of policy, to foster production of biodiesel and raise public awareness. It is sometimes easier to find biodiesel in rural areas than in cities. Biodiesel has lower [[Energy Density]] than fossil diesel fuel, so biodiesel vehicles are not quite able to keep up with the fuel economy of a fossil fuelled diesel vehicle, if the diesel injection system is not reset for the new fuel. If the injection timing is changed to take account of the higher Cetane value of biodiesel, the difference in economy is negligible. Because biodiesel contains more oxygen than diesel or [[vegetable oil fuel]], it produces the lowest emissions from diesel engines, and is lower in most emissions than gasoline engines. Biodiesel has a higher lubricity than mineral diesel and is an additive in European pump diesel for lubricity and emissions reduction.\n\nSome [[Diesel fuel|Diesel]]-powered cars can run with minor modifications on 100% pure [[vegetable oil]]s. Vegetable oils tend to thicken (or solidify if it is waste cooking oil), in cold weather conditions so vehicle modifications (a two tank system with diesel start/stop tank), are essential in order to heat the fuel prior to use under most circumstances.  Heating to the temperature of engine coolant reduces fuel viscosity, to the range cited by injection system manufacturers, for systems prior to 'common rail' or 'unit injection ( VW PD)' systems. Waste vegetable oil, especially if it has been used for a long time, may become hydrogenated and have increased acidity. This can cause the thickening of fuel, gumming in the engine and acid damage of the fuel system. Biodiesel does not have this problem, because it is chemically processed to be PH neutral and lower viscosity. Modern low emission diesels (most often Euro -3 and -4 compliant), typical of the current production in the European industry, would require extensive modification of injector system, pumps and seals etc. due to the higher operating pressures, that are designed thinner (heated) mineral diesel than ever before, for atomisation, if they were to use pure vegetable oil as fuel. Vegetable oil fuel is not suitable for these vehicles as they are currently produced. This reduces the market as increasing numbers of new vehicles are not able to use it. However, the German Elsbett company has successfully produced single tank vegetable oil fuel systems for several decades, and has worked with Volkswagen on their TDI engines. This shows that it is technologically possible to use vegetable oil as a fuel in high efficiency / low emission diesel engines.\n\n[[Greasestock]] is an event held yearly in [[Yorktown Heights, New York]], and is one of the largest showcases of vehicles using waste oil as a biofuel in the United States.<ref>Norman, Jim. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/13/automobiles/13GREASE.html?_r=1&partner=rssnyt&emc=rss&oref=slogin Where There\u2019s Never an Oil Shortage]\".

These cars generally use the hydrogen in one of two methods: combustion or [[fuel-cell]] conversion. In combustion, the hydrogen is \"burned\" in engines in fundamentally the same method as traditional gasoline cars. In fuel-cell conversion, the hydrogen is turned into electricity through fuel cells which then powers electric motors. With either method, the only byproduct from the spent hydrogen is water, however during combustion with air [[NOx]] can be produced.\n\n[[Honda]] introduced its fuel cell vehicle in 1999 called the [[Honda FCX|FCX]] and have since then introduced the second generation [[Honda FCX Clarity|FCX Clarity]].

The common [[internal combustion engine]], usually fueled with gasoline (petrol) or [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] liquids, can be converted to run on gaseous hydrogen.  However, the most efficient use of hydrogen involves the use of [[fuel cell]]s and [[electric motor]]s instead of a traditional engine.  Hydrogen reacts with [[oxygen]] inside the fuel cells, which produces electricity to power the motors.  One primary area of research is [[hydrogen storage]], to try to increase the range of hydrogen vehicles while reducing the weight, [[energy consumption]], and complexity of the storage systems.  Two primary methods of storage are metal hydrides and compression.  Some believe that hydrogen cars will never be economically viable and that the emphasis on this technology is a diversion from the development and popularization of more efficient hybrid cars and other alternative technologies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nA study by [[The Carbon Trust]] for the UK [[Department of Energy and Climate Change]] suggests that hydrogen technologies have the potential to deliver UK transport with near-zero emissions whilst reducing dependence on imported oil and curtailment of renewable generation.

A limited series production of the 7 Series Saloon was announced as commencing at the end of 2006. A BMW hydrogen prototype (H2R) using the driveline of this model broke the speed record for hydrogen cars at 300&nbsp;km/h (186&nbsp;mi/h), making automotive history. Mazda has developed Wankel engines to burn hydrogen. The Wankel uses a rotary principle of operation, so the hydrogen burns in a different part of the engine from the intake. This reduces pre-detonation, a problem with hydrogen fueled piston engines.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe other major car companies like Daimler, Chrysler, Honda, Toyota, Ford and General Motors, are investing in hydrogen fuel cells instead.

Energy is used to liquefy air, and then LN2 is produced by evaporation, and distributed. LN2 is exposed to ambient heat in the car and the resulting nitrogen gas can be used to power a piston or turbine engine. The maximum amount of energy that can be extracted from LN2 is 213 Watt-hours per kg (W\u00b7h/kg) or 173 W\u00b7h per liter, in which a maximum of 70 W\u00b7h/kg can be utilized with an isothermal expansion process. Such a vehicle with a 350-liter (93 gallon) tank can achieve ranges similar to a gasoline powered vehicle with a 50-liter (13 gallon) tank. Theoretical future engines, using cascading topping cycles, can improve this to around 110 W\u00b7h/kg with a quasi-isothermal expansion process. The advantages are zero harmful emissions and superior energy densities compared to a [[Compressed-air vehicle]] as well as being able to refill the tank in a matter of minutes.\n\n=== Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) ===\n{{Main|Natural gas vehicle}}\n[[Liquefied natural gas]] is natural gas that has been cooled to a point at which it becomes a [[cryogenic]] liquid. In this liquid state, natural gas is more than 2 times as dense as highly compressed CNG. LNG fuel systems function on any vehicle capable of burning natural gas. Unlike CNG, which is stored at high pressure (typically 3000 or 3600 psi) and then regulated to a lower pressure that the engine can accept, LNG is stored at low pressure (50 to 150 psi) and simply vaporized by a heat exchanger before entering the fuel metering devices to the engine. Because of its high energy density compared to CNG, it is very suitable for those interested in long ranges while running on natural gas.\n\nIn the United States, the LNG supply chain is the main thing that has held back this fuel source from growing rapidly. The LNG supply chain is very analogous to that of diesel or gasoline. First, pipeline natural gas is liquefied in large quantities, which is analogous to refining gasoline or diesel. Then, the LNG is transported via semi trailer to fuel stations where it is stored in bulk tanks until it is dispensed into a vehicle. CNG, on the other hand, requires expensive compression at each station to fill the high-pressure cylinder cascades.\n\n=== Autogas (LPG) ===\n{{Main|Autogas}}\n[[File:Propane powered blue bird vision.jpg|thumb|right|A propane-fueled [[school bus]] in the United States.]]\nLPG or [[liquefied petroleum gas]] is a low pressure liquefied gas mixture composed mainly of propane and butane which burns in conventional gasoline combustion engines with less CO<sub>2</sub> than gasoline. Gasoline cars can be retrofitted to LPG aka Autogas and become bifuel vehicles as the gasoline tank stays. You can switch between LPG and gasoline during operation. Estimated 10 million vehicles running worldwide.\n\nThere are 17.473 million LPG powered vehicles worldwide as of December 2010, and the leading countries are Turkey (2.394 million vehicles), Poland (2.325 million), and South Korea (2.3 million).<ref name=LPG>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldlpgas.com/autogas/the-autogas-market |title=WLPGA: The Autogas Market |publisher=World LP Gas Association |accessdate=2012-02-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130419182640/http://www.worldlpgas.com/autogas/the-autogas-market |archivedate=2013-04-19 }} See table: Largest autogas markets, 2010</ref> In the U.S., 190,000 on-road vehicles use propane,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://e85.whipnet.net/alt.fuel/propane.faq.html|title=Propane FAQ|accessdate=2011-04-25}}</ref> and 450,000 forklifts use it for power.

Wood, coal, [[ethanol]], or others can be used as [[fuel]]. The fuel is burned in a [[boiler]] and the heat converts water into [[steam]]. When the water turns to steam, it expands. The expansion creates [[pressure]]. The pressure pushes the [[piston]]s back and forth. This turns the [[driveshaft]] to spin the wheels forward. It works like a coal-fueled [[steam train]], or [[steam boat]]. The steam car was the next logical step in independent transport.\n\nSteam cars take a long time to start, but some can reach speeds over 100&nbsp;mph (161&nbsp;km/h) eventually.  The late model [[Doble steam car|Doble Steam Cars]] could be brought to operational condition in less than 30 seconds, had high top speeds and fast acceleration, but were expensive to buy.\n\nA steam engine uses [[external combustion]], as opposed to internal combustion. Gasoline-powered cars are more efficient at about 25\u201328% [[Fuel efficiency|efficiency]]. In theory, a [[combined cycle]] steam engine in which the burning material is first used to drive a [[gas turbine]] can produce 50% to 60% efficiency. However, practical examples of steam engined cars work at only around 5\u20138% efficiency.\n\nThe best known and best selling steam-powered car was the [[Stanley Steamer]]. It used a compact fire-tube boiler under the hood to power a simple two-piston engine which was connected directly to the rear axle. Before [[Henry Ford]] introduced monthly payment financing with great success, cars were typically purchased outright. This is why the Stanley was kept simple; to keep the purchase price affordable.\n\nSteam produced in [[refrigeration]] also can be use by a [[turbine]] in other vehicle types to produce electricity, that can be employed in electric motors or stored in a battery.\n\nSteam power can be combined with a standard oil-based engine to create a hybrid. Water is injected into the cylinder after the fuel is burned, when the piston is still superheated, often at temperatures of 1500 degrees or more. The water will instantly be vaporized into steam, taking advantage of the heat that would otherwise be wasted.\n\n=== Wood gas ===\n[[Image:Gasogenog.jpg|thumb|200px|Vehicle with a gasifier]]\n{{Main|Wood gas generator}}\n[[Wood gas]] can be used to power cars with ordinary internal combustion engines if a [[wood gasifier]] is attached. This was quite popular during World War II in several European and Asian countries because the war prevented easy and cost-effective access to oil.\n{{clear}}\nHerb Hartman of Woodward, Iowa currently drives a wood powered Cadillac. He claims to have attached the gasifier to the Cadillac for just $700. Hartman claims, \u201cA full hopper will go about fifty miles depending on how you drive it,\u201d and he added that splitting the wood was \u201clabor-intensive.

Originally, the sensors were mounted in the fuel line and exhaust system; more recent models do away with the fuel line sensor. Another feature of older flex-fuel cars is a small separate gasoline storage tank that was used for starting the car on cold days, when the ethanol mixture made ignition more difficult.\n[[File:3 Views Honda Flex Titan CG 150 Mix Fuel Injection 06 2009 Itu.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Honda]] [[CG 150 Titan Mix]] was the first flex-fuel motorcycle launched to the market in the world.]]\nModern [[Brazil]]ian flex-fuel technology enables FFVs to run an any blend between [[w:common ethanol fuel mixtures#E20|E20-E25]] [[gasohol]] and [[Neat alcohol fuel|E100 ethanol fuel]], using a [[oxygen sensor|lambda probe]] to measure the quality of combustion, which informs the [[engine control unit]] as to the exact composition of the gasoline-alcohol mixture.

From left to right: Coal to electricity to electrical car. Renewable energy (e.g. wind or photovoltaics) to electrical car. Renewable energy to hydrogen to hydrogen-powered car.

This analysis allows ranking the energy conversion processes along the vehicle fuels production routes and their end-use, so that the best options for the transportation sector can be determined and better energy policies may be issued. Thus, if a drastic CO2 emissions abatement of the transportation sector is pursued, a more intensive utilization of ethanol in the Brazilian transportation sector mix is advisable. However, as the overall exergy conversion efficiency of the sugar cane industry is still very low, which increases the unit energy cost of ethanol, better production and end-use technologies are required. Nonetheless, with the current scenario of a predominantly renewable Brazilian electricity mix, based on more than 80% of renewable sources, this source consolidates as the most promising energy source to reduce the large amount of greenhouse gas emissions which transportation sector is responsible for.<ref name=\"Fl\u00f3rez-OrregoSilva2015\">{{cite journal|last1=Fl\u00f3rez-Orrego|first1=Daniel|last2=Silva|first2=Julio A.M.|last3=Oliveira Jr.|first3=Silvio de|title=Exergy and environmental comparison of the end use of vehicle fuels: The Brazilian case|journal=Energy Conversion and Management|volume=100|year=2015|pages=220\u2013231|issn=0196-8904|doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2015.04.074|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Energy}}\n*[[Alternative Fuels Training Consortium]]\n*[[Alternatives to the automobile]]\n*[[Butanol fuel]]\n*[[Clean Cities]]\n*[[Engine control unit|Engine control unit altering to optimize running on different fuels]] \n*[[Green vehicle]]\n*[[Fuel gas-powered scooter]]\n*[[Hydrogen vehicle]]\n*[[List of hybrid vehicles]]\n*[[Solar-charged vehicle]]\n*[[The Hype about Hydrogen]]\n*[[Water-fuelled car]]\n*[[Jack Talbert]] (Vaporization)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://greet.es.anl.gov/publication-c2g-2016-report  Cradle-to-Grave Lifecycle Analysis of U.S. Light-Duty Vehicle-Fuel Pathways: A Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Economic Assessment of Current (2015) and Future (2025\u20132030) Technologies] (includes estimated cost of avoided GHG emissions from different AFV technologies), [[Argonne National Laboratory]], June 2016.\n*[https://afdc.energy.gov/ Official website of the Alternative Fuels Data Center], [[Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy]], [[United States Department of Energy]]\n* [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18264 Transitions to Alternative Vehicles and Fuels], [[National Academy of Sciences]] (2013)  {{ISBN|978-0-309-26852-3}}\n\n{{Alternative propulsion}}\n{{Automobile configuration}}\n{{Emerging technologies|transport=yes}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Alternative Fuel Vehicle}}\n[[Category:Vehicle technology]]\n[[Category:Green vehicles]]\n[[Category:Emerging technologies]]\n[[Category:Alternative fuels]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing, replaced: Congres \u2192 Congress, therefor \u2192 therefore", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_fuel_vehicle"}
