They were laid down in the late 1930s as part of the [[British re-armament|rearmament]] of British forces in response to the emerging threats of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Imperial Japan]].\n\nThe ''Illustrious'' class comprised four vessels: [[Her Majesty's Ship|HM Ships]] [[HMS Illustrious (R87)|''Illustrious'']], [[HMS Formidable (R67)|''Formidable'']], [[HMS Victorious (R38)|''Victorious'']] and [[HMS Indomitable (R92)|''Indomitable'']]. The last of these was built to a modified design with a second, half-length, hangar deck below the main hangar deck. Each of these ships played a prominent part in the battles of the Second World War. ''Victorious'' took part in the pursuit of the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']], ''Illustrious'' and ''Formidable'' played prominent parts in the battles in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of World War II|Mediterranean]] during 1940 and 1941 and all three took part in the large actions of the [[British Pacific Fleet]] in 1945.\n\nThe later two ships of the [[Implacable-class aircraft carrier|''Implacable'' class]] were also built to modified designs to carry larger [[Carrier air wing|air wings]]. {{HMS|Implacable|R86|2}} and {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} both had two hangar levels, albeit with a limited {{convert|14|ft|m|1|adj=on}} head room.\n\n==Design and concept==\nThe ''Illustrious'' class was designed within the restrictions of the [[Second London Naval Treaty]], which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000&nbsp;tons. They were different in conception to the Royal Navy's only modern carrier at the time, their predecessor [[HMS Ark Royal (91)|HMS ''Ark Royal'']], and what may be described as their nearest American contemporaries, the [[Yorktown class aircraft carrier|''Yorktown'']] and [[Essex class aircraft carrier|''Essex'']] class carriers. The ''Illustrious'' class followed the ''Yorktown'' but preceded the ''Essex'', the latter being designed after the US abandonment of the Second London Naval Treaty and its tonnage limitations.\n\nWhere other designs emphasised large air groups as the primary means of defence, the ''Illustrious'' class relied on their [[anti-aircraft gun|anti-aircraft armament]] and the passive defence provided by an [[armoured flight deck]] for survival; resulting in a reduced aircraft complement. Other carriers had armour carried on lower decks (e.g. the hangar deck or main deck); the unprotected flight deck and the hangar below it formed part of the [[superstructure]], and were unprotected against even small bombs. However, the hangar could be made larger and thus more aircraft could be carried, but the differences in aircraft capacity between these carriers and their United States Navy (USN) counterparts is largely due to the some 100-foot-longer overall length of the US designs, and the USN's operational doctrine, which allowed for a permanent deck park of aircraft to augment their hangar capacity.<ref>Friedman, pp.18-19.</ref><ref>Hone, Friedman, Mandeles, ''British and American Carrier Development, 1919\u20131941'', p125:'' \"The 1931 edition of \"Progress in Tactics\" included a section on foreign tactics, including operating practices. The U.S. portion mentioned that \"the number of aircraft in carriers is proportionately much higher than in our Navy, largely due to the practice of storing some aircraft permanently on deck.\"''</ref> ''Illustrious''{{'}}s hangar was 82%<ref>Friedman, in his works on RN (p.154) and USN (P.392), aircraft carriers states that ''Enterprise''{{'}}s hangar measured 546 feet x 63 feet versus 456 x 62 feet for the ''Illustrious'' class, therefore ''Illustrious''{{'}}s hangar had 82% of ''Enterprise''{{'}}s hangar capacity.</ref> as large as {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}}{{'}}s, but ''Enterprise'' typically carried 30% of her aircraft capacity in her deck park. ''Indomitable''{{'}}s two hangars were actually larger than ''Enterprise''{{'}}s, but she carried fewer aircraft because she did not have a large permanent deck park. In 1944/45 RN carriers began to carry a permanent deck park of similar size to their USN counterparts, and this increased their aircraft complement from 36 to an eventual 57 aircraft in the single-hangar carriers, and from 48 up to 81 in the double-hangar, 23,400-ton ''[[Implacable class aircraft carrier|Implacable]]'' design, compared to 90\u2013110 for the 27,500-ton US ''Essex'' class.<ref>Friedman 1988, p. 145</ref><ref>USS ''Bennington'', ''Action Report, OPERATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THE OCCUPATION OF OKINAWA INCLUDING STRIKE AGAINST KANOYA AIRFIELD, KYUSHU. 28 May to 10 June 1945'', p.18. On June 5, 1945, USS ''Bennington'' reported that her maximum hangar capacity was 51 aircraft, 15 SB2Cs and 36 F4Us, and that 52 were carried as a deck park. At that time she carried 15 TBMs, 15 SB2Cs, and the rest were a mix of F6Fs and F4Us. She was prompted to utilize, and report on, her maximum hangar storage due to a typhoon.</ref>\n\nIn the ''Illustrious'' class, armour was carried at the flight deck level\u2014which became the strength deck\u2014and formed an armoured box-like hangar that was an integral part of the ship's structure. However, to make this possible without increasing the displacement it was necessary to reduce the overhead height of the hangars to 16&nbsp;ft (4.88 m) in the ''Illustrious'' class hangars and 14&nbsp;ft (4.27 m) in the upper hangar of the ''Indomitable'' and 16&nbsp;ft (4.88 m) in her lower hangar; these compared unfavourably to the  17&nbsp;feet 3&nbsp;inches (5.3&nbsp;m) of the ''Essex'' class, 17&nbsp;ft 6&nbsp;inches (5.38&nbsp;m) in ''Enterprise'' and 20&nbsp;ft (6.10 m) in ''Saratoga''.<ref>Friedman</ref> This restricted operations with larger aircraft designs, particularly post-war.\n\nThis armour scheme was designed to withstand 1,000 pound bombs (and heavier bombs which struck at an angle); in the [[British Home Fleet|Home]] and Mediterranean theatres it was likely that the carriers would operate within the range of shore-based aircraft, which could carry heavier bombs than their carrier-based equivalents. The flight deck had an armoured thickness of 3&nbsp;inches, closed by 4.5-inch sides and bulkheads. There were 3-inch [[strake]]s on either side extending from the box sides to the top edge of the main side belt, which was of 4.5&nbsp;inches. The main belt protected the machinery, petrol storage, magazines and aerial weapon stores. The lifts were placed outside the hangar, at either end, with access through sliding armoured doors in the end bulkheads.\n\nLater in the war it was found that bombs which penetrated and detonated inside the armoured hangar could cause structural deformation, as the latter was an integral part of the ship's structure.\n\nPre-war doctrine held that the ship's own firepower, rather than its aircraft, were to be relied upon for protection, since in the absence of radar, fighters were unlikely to intercept incoming attackers before they could release their weapons. Accordingly, the Illustrious class was given an extremely heavy Anti-Aircraft armament. The armament was similar to ''Ark Royal'' with twin 4.5&nbsp;inch turrets (in a new \"between-decks\" or countersunk design) arranged on the points of a quadrant. The guns were mounted sufficiently high so that they could fire across the decks; de-fuelled aircraft would be stowed in the hangar for protection during aerial attack. The ''Illustrious Class'' were fitted with four [[HACS]] controlled High Angle Director Towers, for fire control of her 4.5\" guns. ''Illustrious'' pioneered the use of [[Radar]] to vector carrier borne fighters onto attacking or shadowing aircraft, and a [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighter from ''Illustrious'' achieved the first radar directed kill on 2 September 1940.<ref>Thomas, Andrew, ''Royal Navy Aces of World War Two'', p24.</ref>\n\n==Ships in class==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n![[Pennant number|Pennant]]\n!width=\"20%\"|Builder\n!Ordered\n!Laid down\n!Launched\n!Commissioned\n!Fate\n|-\n!colspan=8|''Illustrious'' subgroup\n|-\n|{{HMS|Illustrious|87|2}}\n|87\n|[[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]]\n|13 April 1937\n|27 April 1937\n|5 April 1939\n|25 May 1940\n|Broken up at [[Gare Loch]], 1957\n|-\n|{{HMS|Formidable|67|2}}\n|67\n|[[Harland and Wolff|Harland & Wolff]], [[Belfast]]\n|19 March 1937\n|17 June 1937\n|17 August 1939\n|24 November 1940\n|Broken up at [[Inverkeithing]], 1953\n|-\n|{{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}}\n|38\n|[[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Wallsend]]\n|13 January 1937\n|4 May 1937\n|14 September 1939\n|14 May 1941\n|Broken up at Faslane, 1969\n|-\n!colspan=8|''Indomitable'' subgroup\n|-\n|{{HMS|Indomitable|92|2}}\n|92\n|[[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]]\n|6 July 1937\n|10 November 1937\n|26 March 1940\n|10 October 1941\n|Broken up at [[Faslane]], 1955\n|}\n\n===Fate of the class===\n[[File:HMS Victorious (R38) aerial c1959.jpeg|thumb|''Victorious'' in 1959]]\nAll four early ships were hard worked during the Second World War, with ''Illustrious'' and ''Formidable'' suffering and surviving heavy damage.  Like their contemporary {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} they fought a long and consuming war and despite significant overhauls and repair of battle damage, were worn out by 1946 and were scrapped in the mid-1950s.  Due to a variety of factors including [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#1945\u20131951: Age of Austerity|Britain's dire post war finances]], and the consequent [[Royal Navy#Postwar period and early 21st century|reductions in the size of the Royal Navy]] post war modernization was limited to just the last of the class; ''Victorious'', which was given a massive eight-year-long reconstruction between 1950 and 1957 (to enable her to operate [[Cold War]]-era jet aircraft), was retired in 1968 after a minor fire. ''Indomitable'' was given an extensive refit, including new boilers, from 1948 to 1950, then served as flagship of the Home Fleet and also saw service in the Mediterranean. She suffered a hangar deck [[Gasoline|petrol]] explosion and fire in early 1953. She was placed in reserve after Queen Elizabeth II's October 1953 Coronation Review and was then scrapped in 1955.<ref>Friedman, p.153.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of

[[aircraft carrier]] of the [[Royal Navy]] that included some of the most important British warships in the [[World War II|Second World War]]. They were laid down in the late 1930s as part of the [[British re-armament|rearmament]] of British forces in response to the emerging threats of [[Nazi Germany]], [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Fascist Italy]] and [[Imperial Japan]].\n\nThe ''Illustrious'' class comprised four vessels: [[Her Majesty's Ship|HM Ships]] [[HMS Illustrious (R87)|''Illustrious'']], [[HMS Formidable (R67)|''Formidable'']], [[HMS Victorious (R38)|''Victorious'']] and [[HMS Indomitable (R92)|''Indomitable'']]. The last of these was built to a modified design with a second, half-length, hangar deck below the main hangar deck. Each of these ships played a prominent part in the battles of the Second World War. ''Victorious'' took part in the pursuit of the [[German battleship Bismarck|German battleship ''Bismarck'']], ''Illustrious'' and ''Formidable'' played prominent parts in the battles in the [[Mediterranean Theatre of World War II|Mediterranean]] during 1940 and 1941 and all three took part in the large actions of the [[British Pacific Fleet]] in 1945.\n\nThe later two ships of the [[Implacable-class aircraft carrier|''Implacable'' class]] were also built to modified designs to carry larger [[Carrier air wing|air wings]]. {{HMS|Implacable|R86|2}} and {{HMS|Indefatigable|R10|2}} both had two hangar levels, albeit with a limited {{convert|14|ft|m|1|adj=on}} head room.\n\n==Design and concept==\nThe ''Illustrious'' class was designed within the restrictions of the [[Second London Naval Treaty]], which limited carrier size to an upper limit of 23,000&nbsp;tons.

The guns were mounted sufficiently high so that they could fire across the decks; de-fuelled aircraft would be stowed in the hangar for protection during aerial attack. The ''Illustrious Class'' were fitted with four [[HACS]] controlled High Angle Director Towers, for fire control of her 4.5\" guns. ''Illustrious'' pioneered the use of [[Radar]] to vector carrier borne fighters onto attacking or shadowing aircraft, and a [[Fairey Fulmar]] fighter from ''Illustrious'' achieved the first radar directed kill on 2 September 1940.<ref>Thomas, Andrew, ''Royal Navy Aces of World War Two'', p24.</ref>\n\n==Ships in class==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!Name\n![[Pennant number|Pennant]]\n!width=\"20%\"|Builder\n!Ordered\n!Laid down\n!Launched\n!Commissioned\n!Fate\n|-\n!colspan=8|''Illustrious'' subgroup\n|-\n|{{HMS|Illustrious|87|2}}\n|87\n|[[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]]\n|13 April 1937\n|27 April 1937\n|5 April 1939\n|25 May 1940\n|Broken up at [[Gare Loch]], 1957\n|-\n|{{HMS|Formidable|67|2}}\n|67\n|[[Harland and Wolff|Harland & Wolff]], [[Belfast]]\n|19 March 1937\n|17 June 1937\n|17 August 1939\n|24 November 1940\n|Broken up at [[Inverkeithing]], 1953\n|-\n|{{HMS|Victorious|R38|2}}\n|38\n|[[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Wallsend]]\n|13 January 1937\n|4 May 1937\n|14 September 1939\n|14 May 1941\n|Broken up at Faslane, 1969\n|-\n!colspan=8|''Indomitable'' subgroup\n|-\n|{{HMS|Indomitable|92|2}}\n|92\n|[[Vickers-Armstrongs]], [[Barrow-in-Furness]]\n|6 July 1937\n|10 November 1937\n|26 March 1940\n|10 October 1941\n|Broken up at [[Faslane]], 1955\n|}\n\n===Fate of the class===\n[[File:HMS Victorious (R38) aerial c1959.jpeg|thumb|''Victorious'' in 1959]]\nAll four early ships were hard worked during the Second World War, with ''Illustrious'' and ''Formidable'' suffering and surviving heavy damage.  Like their contemporary {{USS|Enterprise|CV-6|6}} they fought a long and consuming war and despite significant overhauls and repair of battle damage, were worn out by 1946 and were scrapped in the mid-1950s.  Due to a variety of factors including [[Economic history of the United Kingdom#1945.E2.80.931951: Age of Austerity|Britain's dire post war finances]], and the consequent [[Royal Navy#Postwar period and early 21st century|reductions in the size of the Royal Navy]] post war modernization was limited to just the last of the class; ''Victorious'', which was given a massive eight-year-long reconstruction between 1950 and 1957 (to enable her to operate [[Cold War]]-era jet aircraft), was retired in 1968 after a minor fire. ''Indomitable'' was given an extensive refit, including new boilers, from 1948 to 1950, then served as flagship of the Home Fleet and also saw service in the Mediterranean. She suffered a hangar deck [[Gasoline|petrol]] explosion and fire in early 1953. She was placed in reserve after Queen Elizabeth II's October 1953 Coronation Review and was then scrapped in 1955.<ref>Friedman, p.153.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of ships of the Second World War]]\n*[[List of ship classes of the Second World War]]\n\n==References==\n*{{cite book|last=Brown |first=David |title=WWII Fact Files: Aircraft Carriers|location=New York |publisher=Arco Publishing |year=1977 |isbn=0-668-04164-1}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Brown |first1=David K. |title=Re: Armor from Czechoslovakia|journal=Warship International |date=1998 |volume=XXXV |issue=1 |pages=9\u201310}}\n* {{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|title=Naval Weapons of World War II|year=1985|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=0-87021-459-4}}\n*{{cite book|last=Chesneau|first=Roger|title=Aircraft Carriers of the World, 1914 to the Present: An Illustrated Encyclopedia|edition=New, Revised|year=1995|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=0-87021-902-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/aircraftcarriers00ches}}\n* {{cite book|title=Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1922\u20131946|editor1-last=Chesneau|editor1-first=Roger|publisher=Conway Maritime Press|location=Greenwich, UK|year=1980|isbn=0-85177-146-7}}\n* {{cite book|last=Friedman|first=Norman|authorlink=Norman Friedman|title=British Carrier Aviation: The Evolution of the Ships and Their Aircraft|year=1988|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|isbn=0-87021-054-8}}\n*{{cite book |last= Friedman |first= Norman |title= U.S. Aircraft Carriers: An Illustrated Design History |year= 1983 |publisher= Naval Institute Press |location= Annapolis, Maryland|isbn= 0-87021-739-9 }}\n*{{cite book|last=Hobbs|first=David|title=British Aircraft Carriers: Design, Development and Service Histories|year=2013|publisher=Seaforth Publishing|location=Barnsley, UK|isbn=978-1-84832-138-0}}\n*{{cite book|last=McCart|first=Neil|title=The Illustrious & Implacable Classes of Aircraft Carrier 1940\u20131969|publisher=Fan Publications|location=Cheltenham, UK|year=2000|isbn=1-901225-04-6}} \n* {{cite book|last=Rohwer|first=J\u00fcrgen|title=Chronology of the War at Sea 1939\u20131945: The Naval History of World War Two|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, Maryland|year=2005|edition=Third Rev|isbn=1-59114-119-2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat-inline|Illustrious class aircraft carriers}}\n* [http://www.armouredcarriers.com/ Armoured aircraft carrier action and damage reports, 1940-1945]\n*[https://archive.is/20130129174959/http://navalistica.com/index.php/royal-navy-united-kingdom/19-ukcv/151-2105-illustrious-fleet-aircraft-carriers-1940-1941 ILLUSTRIOUS fleet aircraft carriers (1940\u20131941)]\n<!-- non-breaking space to keep AWB drones from altering the space before the navbox-->\n\n{{Illustrious class aircraft carrier}}\n{{WWIIBritishShips}}\n{{Subject bar\n| portal2=World War II\n| portal3=United Kingdom\n| portal4=War}}\n\n[[Category:Aircraft carrier classes]]\n[[Category:Illustrious-class aircraft carriers| ]]\n[[Category:World War II aircraft carriers of the United Kingdom| ]]\n[[Category:Cold War aircraft carriers of the United Kingdom| ]]\n[[Category:Ship classes of the Royal Navy]]\n", "name_user": "Keith-264", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleaned up usingAutoEd", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illustrious-class_aircraft_carrier"}

The series was adapted for [[The CW]] by Noga Landau, [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Stephanie Savage]], and is produced by [[CBS Television Studios]], in association with [[Fake Empire Productions|Fake Empire]]. \n\nIt is the third ''Nancy Drew'' television series, following ''[[The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries]]'' (1977\u20131979) and a [[Nancy Drew (1995 TV series)|1995 Canadian-American version]]. Development for a new television series started in 2015 at [[Columbia Broadcasting System|CBS]], then later at [[NBC]]. In 2018, the project moved to The CW where the series was ordered for a pilot.\n\nThe series is narrated and lead by the amateur sleuth [[Nancy Drew]], played by Kennedy McMann, and features an ensemble cast with re-imagined versions of the characters from the books: [[Leah Lewis]] as [[George Fayne|George Fan]], [[Maddison Jaizani]] as Bess Marvin, [[Tunji Kasim]] as [[Ned Nickerson|Ned Nickerson]] and [[Scott Wolf]] as Carson Drew. It also stars [[Alex Saxon (actor)|Alex Saxon]], Alvina August and [[Riley Smith]] as new characters invented for the series.\n \nThe series debuted on October 9, 2019 to mixed reviews.

grief of her mother Katherine's death. All that changes when one night, she and her co-workers George, Bess, and Ace discover the body of Tiffany Hudson, wife of local businessman Ryan Hudson. When the police chief tries to pin the murder on Nancy, whom he's despised for years, she breaks into Ryan's house looking for evidence and finds a locket hidden in a secret compartment. The locket contains a reference to Lucy Sable, a girl who was killed nineteen years ago; Nancy, Bess, and George hire a medium to contact Lucy's spirit and receive a cryptic message to \"find the dress\". Nancy discovers that her father is secretly dating a cop, Karen Hart, and that her boyfriend Nick served time after Tiffany testified against him in court. She decides to try and figure out who killed Tiffany, with Bess, George, and Nick among her potential suspects.

Nancy learns that the Hudson family has arranged for Tiffany's body to be moved out of town, so she decides to break into the morgue and take some blood to be analyzed. She also spies on George, learning of her secret relationship with Ryan. George angrily refuses to help, blaming Nancy for her reputation as a \"slut\" in high school. Bess and Ace pretend to have car trouble to delay Ryan's transporter Lisbeth, who hits it off with Bess. Nancy retrieves the blood and some evidence connected to Lucy's case, but accidentally trips the alarm; George suddenly arrives and hides the goods while Nancy is arrested. Carson agrees to represent Ryan in order to afford his daughter's bail. He tells her that Nick couldn't have known Tiffany's identity since she testified behind a screen.

Bess turns out to be an English girl who believes the Marvins are her biological relatives, but isn't entirely sure. On the day of Tiffany's funeral, a ghost attacks Bess in the Claw's walk-in, prompting the girls to turn to George's clairvoyant mother Victoria who explains how to perform a ritual that will seal Tiffany's ghost away for good. Tiffany's sister, Laura Tandy, arrives in town seeking to learn the truth behind her death and recruits Ace, her ex-boyfriend, to help. At the funeral, George manages to only complete part of the ritual due to Bess wandering away from her post. Laura upstages Ryan's father Everett's eulogy by playing Tiffany's last 911 call and announcing her intentions to seek justice. Carson subsequently informs the media that Tiffany's autopsy report is inconclusive, angering Ryan. That night, Ned learns from a hidden camera that Laura broke into his garage, and Nancy follows a clue left by a ghost to [[Carolyn Keene|Keene]] High School, turning up a photo of Lucy with Karen.

Ryan has an argument with Owen, which George witnesses; Tiffany takes over, steals a dress and knife, and goes to confront him. Victoria and Bess arrive, and despite Laura disrupting the ritual, are able to banish her. Ace and Nick force Laura to return the flash drive she stole. Using a code word given to him by Tiffany in her final moments, Nick breaks the password on the drive and finds a mountain of evidence compiled against the Hudsons, including a possible connection to Owen.

In exchange for agreeing to steal a collection of priceless [[Roman Empire|Roman]] coins for him from an auction at the Velvet Masque club, Nancy forces Ryan to escort her inside the club, normally off-limits to locals. Bess and Lisbeth have their first date, but when Lisbeth leaves early, Bess is devastated. To cheer her up, George brings her along on a mission with Nick to infiltrate the club; the two had earlier deduced that the coins were linked to the sinking of a cargo ship that killed Owen's uncle, and plan to steal them to expose the Hudsons for their alleged involvement. Owen seeks the coins for the same reason, and manages to get the group kicked out before winning the auction. Nancy discovers that Ryan's parents had Carson, their family's personal attorney in 1999, get rid of Lucy to keep her away from their son, and to cover up her discovery of an affair between Owen's uncle and Ryan's mother Celia Hudson. Lisbeth gives Bess a make-up date, and they kiss.

Laura openly accuses Chief McGinnis of covering up Tiffany's death, forcing him to hand the case over to state authorities. Ace begins to suspect that Laura may be Tiffany's killer after learning that she stands to inherit her sister's money, but Nancy discovers his secret arrangement with McGinnis, shattering their trust. Nancy's contact informs her that the evidence she sent to him for analysis has disappeared, so she tracks down Lucy's half-brother to obtain the only other item that can be used to summon her, a bracelet she wore before her death. Victoria is too drunk to help, so the group conducts the s\u00e9ance themselves, destroying the coins in the process. Nick breaks up with Nancy afterwards for pushing him away.

George is unable to find Ace's spirit due to the negative energy between Nancy and Carson, so Nancy clears it by making him promise to reveal everything once the ceremony is finished. George finds Ace's spirit in the form of a young boy, but he remains in a coma. Nancy uses a clue George found to expose Officer Rawley, the dirty cop responsible for the accident.

Nancy and Carson visit Gomber's old warehouse while George and Nick work on deciphering a note passed by Gomber to his only visitor, Moira Baker. Nancy realizes that there are gaps in her memory from the night she found Rose--the result, she believes, of an entity called Simon who was manipulating Gomber. George finds a location for Moira's antique store and breaks in with Nick at the same time that Nancy finds the shrine Gomber built for Simon and burns it; Moira is caught and Ted is located by Nick. When Nancy goes to see Gomber one last time, he says that his business with Simon is far from over. Bess reveals her secret to Owen.

Ace takes her to his father, who worked on the case and gives Nancy clues indicating that the killer is still in Horseshoe Bay.

Owen introduces Nancy to Bashiir, the only survivor of the ''Bonny Scot''. She discovers that Bashiir is haunted by his [[survivor's guilt]], but is unwilling to come forward out of fear of deportation. With Owen's help, Nancy arranges a sting led by Lisbeth to take Everett into custody.

There, they discover an infestation of strange mold, swarms of bugs, and a man named Sal who claims that the building is haunted by the spirits of the family who died there in the 1870s. Carson is nearly stabbed in prison before Ace is able to fake a transfer request; he takes Carson to his own home and contacts Karen for help when the police show up. Bess impresses Amaya with her wit and clever observations. With no evidence to prove Carson's life is in danger, Bess cuts a deal with Ryan, offering to grant him a favor from the Marvin family in exchange. Ryan's evidence, coupled with a call from Amaya, is enough to get Carson released from jail before he's tried. Nancy finds Patrice, who shows signs of [[dementia]] and tells her to find \"the thin man's book\". Sal directs her to the Whisper Box, where the family's possessions are kept, but then pulls the fire alarm. Nancy is left trapped inside the Whisper Box and falls into a deep sleep, waking up in a fantasy world where her mother is alive.\n |LineColor       = 8BADB9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 13\n |Title           = The Whisper Box\n |DirectedBy      = Larry Teng\n |WrittenBy       = Noga Landau & Alex Taub\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|5}}\n |Viewers         = 0.62<ref name=\"1.13\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-5-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Wednesday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.5.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 6, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=February 6, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = With Sal's help, Nick and the others break into the asylum and try to communicate with an unconscious Nancy. Realizing that she's trapped in a fantasy, Nancy recruits the imaginary versions of her friends to help find a way out. From Ryan, they receive a puzzle that Nancy supposedly set up for herself, which leads to a graveyard and a mysterious key. The key turns out, however, to be a [[red herring]]; Nancy discovers that the real way out is through a letter written by her late mother. Despite being tempted to stay and make up for all of her life's regrets, she decides to give it up and returns to the real world. The group escapes as the asylum burns down, and Nancy is reunited with her father. Having found a keycard, she visits the local Historical Society and learns that it opens a lockbox placed there by Tiffany. Inside, she finds a recording of a video made several months earlier, where Tiffany reveals that someone has been following her before a ghost suddenly appears and the video is cut short.

Laura returns to collect her inheritance, and asks Ace to move with her to [[Paris]]. Nancy moves ahead with her plan to find out who really killed Lucy by having Ace hack her old email account, which turns up messages between her and Ryan that reveal they were supposed to meet the night she died. Bess becomes concerned that Amaya has a romantic interest in her, which George tells her to break off. Nancy brings the group, Laura, Karen, and Ryan to the diner, where she has them reenact the events leading up to Tiffany's murder. The reenactment leads to a major breakthrough: a poisoned salad that was prepared for Ryan was instead served to Tiffany. Nancy takes this as evidence that the murder was revenge for Ryan killing Lucy; Ryan flees after he sees Lucy's ghost. Nancy visits Joshua to check Lucy's old computer, but quickly deduces he poisoned the salad. When he tries to kill her, he accidentally electrocutes himself. Ace ends things with Laura before she leaves.

Nick and Ace visit Ace's father, who has come out of retirement to rejoin the force, and learn that the poison used to kill Tiffany was stolen from police evidence. Nancy correctly deduces that Joshua had an accomplice: Karen. Despite her arrest, however, Carson informs her he needs actual physical evidence to clear his name. Owen, George, and Bess go the Historical Society and conduct research on the Agleaca, a spirit that supposedly grants the heart's desire of whoever summons it, but for a price. The group performs the summoning ritual, and the Agleaca grants Nancy's wish by delivering her Lucy's bones. In return, it attempts to claim Owen's life, forcing George to break the summoning wreath. Ace stashes the bones, Nick accepts George's offer to spend the night at her home, and Owen and Nancy sleep together.

Nick and George manage to hide the bones in time, but the experience causes friction between them. Nancy picks up Ryan and takes him along with her as she questions several witnesses, including Everett and Karen, to try and piece together Lucy's final hours. They visit her childhood home and find her diary hidden in the walls. When Nancy has to testify at her father's trial, she reveals the truth: Lucy committed suicide out of despair when Everett forced her to end things with Ryan. Carson is cleared of all charges. While cleaning the diner, George and Nick give into their feelings and kiss. Bess finds one of the bones is missing, unaware that Det. Tamura found it.

The only problem is that for the ritual to work, Nancy must offer her both her blood and that of a blood relative. She tries to get Ryan to help by agreeing to assist him in his effort to learn about his missing child. However, when Ryan admits he doesn't want to help Owen, Nancy barrages him with insults and he angrily drives off without her. At Diana Marvin's birthday party, Bess is told that she will be expected to extract information from Lisbeth about her police work in exchange for her family's approval of their relationship. Ryan deduces the truth and confronts Nancy; she confesses that she doesn't want him to be her father. Ryan nevertheless holds up his end of the bargain and takes part in the ritual. Unfortunately, the visions only get worse. Nancy suggests, and Victoria confirms, that the Agleaca was once a human who was wrongfully executed, and is now enraged and desires blood.

|ShortSummary    = In the fictional town of Horseshoe Bay, [[Maine]], retired teenage detective Nancy Drew is spending her gap year working as a waitress at The Bayside Claw while she deals with the grief of her mother Katherine's death. All that changes when one night, she and her co-workers George, Bess, and Ace discover the body of Tiffany Hudson, wife of local businessman Ryan Hudson. When the police chief tries to pin the murder on Nancy, whom he's despised for years, she breaks into Ryan's house looking for evidence and finds a locket hidden in a secret compartment. The locket contains a reference to Lucy Sable, a girl who was killed nineteen years ago; Nancy, Bess, and George hire a medium to contact Lucy's spirit and receive a cryptic message to \"find the dress\". Nancy discovers that her father is secretly dating a cop, Karen Hart, and that her boyfriend Nick served time after Tiffany testified against him in court. She decides to try and figure out who killed Tiffany, with Bess, George, and Nick among her potential suspects.

Nancy learns that the Hudson family has arranged for Tiffany's body to be moved out of town, so she decides to break into the morgue and take some blood to be analyzed. She also spies on George, learning of her secret relationship with Ryan. George angrily refuses to help, blaming Nancy for her reputation as a \"slut\" in high school. Bess and Ace pretend to have car trouble to delay Ryan's transporter Lisbeth, who hits it off with Bess. Nancy retrieves the blood and some evidence connected to Lucy's case, but accidentally trips the alarm; George suddenly arrives and hides the goods while Nancy is arrested. Carson agrees to represent Ryan in order to afford his daughter's bail. He tells her that Nick couldn't have known Tiffany's identity since she testified behind a screen.

Bess turns out to be an English girl who believes the Marvins are her biological relatives, but isn't entirely sure. On the day of Tiffany's funeral, a ghost attacks Bess in the Claw's walk-in, prompting the girls to turn to George's clairvoyant mother Victoria who explains how to perform a ritual that will seal Tiffany's ghost away for good. Tiffany's sister, Laura Tandy, arrives in town seeking to learn the truth behind her death and recruits Ace, her ex-boyfriend, to help. At the funeral, George manages to only complete part of the ritual due to Bess wandering away from her post. Laura upstages Ryan's father Everett's eulogy by playing Tiffany's last 911 call and announcing her intentions to seek justice. Carson subsequently informs the media that Tiffany's autopsy report is inconclusive, angering Ryan. That night, Ned learns from a hidden camera that Laura broke into his garage, and Nancy follows a clue left by a ghost to [[Carolyn Keene|Keene]] High School, turning up a photo of Lucy with Karen.

Victoria warns the group that unless a ritual of exorcism is performed, she will eventually consume George's life force, erasing her forever. Local developer Owen Marvin hires the Bayside Claw to provide catering services to a local charity gala, but Bess asks Nick to go in her place to avoid having to deal with his family. While at the gala, Nancy runs into Karen, who reveals Lucy died a year after abruptly ending their friendship. Ryan has an argument with Owen, which George witnesses; Tiffany takes over, steals a dress and knife, and goes to confront him. Victoria and Bess arrive, and despite Laura disrupting the ritual, are able to banish her. Ace and Nick force Laura to return the flash drive she stole. Using a code word given to him by Tiffany in her final moments, Nick breaks the password on the drive and finds a mountain of evidence compiled against the Hudsons, including a possible connection to Owen.

In exchange for agreeing to steal a collection of priceless [[Roman Empire|Roman]] coins for him from an auction at the Velvet Masque club, Nancy forces Ryan to escort her inside the club, normally off-limits to locals. Bess and Lisbeth have their first date, but when Lisbeth leaves early, Bess is devastated. To cheer her up, George brings her along on a mission with Nick to infiltrate the club; the two had earlier deduced that the coins were linked to the sinking of a cargo ship that killed Owen's uncle, and plan to steal them to expose the Hudsons for their alleged involvement. Owen seeks the coins for the same reason, and manages to get the group kicked out before winning the auction. Nancy discovers that Ryan's parents had Carson, their family's personal attorney in 1999, get rid of Lucy to keep her away from their son, and to cover up her discovery of an affair between Owen's uncle and Ryan's mother Celia Hudson. Lisbeth gives Bess a make-up date, and they kiss.

Laura openly accuses Chief McGinnis of covering up Tiffany's death, forcing him to hand the case over to state authorities. Ace begins to suspect that Laura may be Tiffany's killer after learning that she stands to inherit her sister's money, but Nancy discovers his secret arrangement with McGinnis, shattering their trust. Nancy's contact informs her that the evidence she sent to him for analysis has disappeared, so she tracks down Lucy's half-brother to obtain the only other item that can be used to summon her, a bracelet she wore before her death. Victoria is too drunk to help, so the group conducts the s\u00e9ance themselves, destroying the coins in the process. Nick breaks up with Nancy afterwards for pushing him away. An unknown spirit is shown communicating with George's younger sister Ted.

McGinnis gathers Nancy, George, and Carson to form a spirit circle and send George to the spirit world. Based on Nancy's deduction that someone intentionally tampered with Laura's car to trigger the crash, Nick and Bess confront Lisbeth, who they think may be responsible. Lisbeth then comes clean: she is actually an undercover state police officer investigating the Hudsons. George is unable to find Ace's spirit due to the negative energy between Nancy and Carson, so Nancy clears it by making him promise to reveal everything once the ceremony is finished. George finds Ace's spirit in the form of a young boy, but he remains in a coma. Nancy uses a clue George found to expose Officer Rawley, the dirty cop responsible for the accident.

Nancy and Carson visit Gomber's old warehouse while George and Nick work on deciphering a note passed by Gomber to his only visitor, Moira Baker. Nancy realizes that there are gaps in her memory from the night she found Rose--the result, she believes, of an entity called Simon who was manipulating Gomber. George finds a location for Moira's antique store and breaks in with Nick at the same time that Nancy finds the shrine Gomber built for Simon and burns it; Moira is caught and Ted is located by Nick. When Nancy goes to see Gomber one last time, he says that his business with Simon is far from over. Bess reveals her secret to Owen.

Nancy's investigation leads her to an old case involving a serial poisoner from nearly seventeen years earlier. Ace takes her to his father, who worked on the case and gives Nancy clues indicating that the killer is still in Horseshoe Bay.

Carson is nearly stabbed in prison before Ace is able to fake a transfer request; he takes Carson to his own home and contacts Karen for help when the police show up. Bess impresses Amaya with her wit and clever observations. With no evidence to prove Carson's life is in danger, Bess cuts a deal with Ryan, offering to grant him a favor from the Marvin family in exchange. Ryan's evidence, coupled with a call from Amaya, is enough to get Carson released from jail before he's tried.

Realizing that she's trapped in a fantasy, Nancy recruits the imaginary versions of her friends to help find a way out. From Ryan, they receive a puzzle that Nancy supposedly set up for herself, which leads to a graveyard and a mysterious key. The key turns out, however, to be a [[red herring]]; Nancy discovers that the real way out is through a letter written by her late mother. Despite being tempted to stay and make up for all of her life's regrets, she decides to give it up and returns to the real world. The group escapes as the asylum burns down, and Nancy is reunited with her father. Having found a keycard, she visits the local Historical Society and learns that it opens a lockbox placed there by Tiffany. Inside, she finds a recording of a video made several months earlier, where Tiffany reveals that someone has been following her before a ghost suddenly appears and the video is cut short. Nancy realizes that Tiffany was likely killed for trying to uncover who murdered Lucy Sable.\n |LineColor       = 8BADB9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber   = 14\n |Title           = The Sign of the Uninvited Guest\n |DirectedBy      = Amanda Row\n |WrittenBy       = Katherine DiSavino\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|2|26}}\n |Viewers         = 0.59<ref name=\"1.14\">{{cite web|url=http://www.showbuzzdaily.com/articles/showbuzzdailys-top-150-wednesday-cable-originals-network-finals-2-26-2020.html|title=Updated: ShowBuzzDaily's Top 150 Wednesday Cable Originals & Network Finals: 2.26.2020|last=Metcalf|first=Mitch|date=February 27, 2020|work=Showbuzz Daily|accessdate=February 27, 2020}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary    = Patrice breaks into the Claw, and her son Joshua, Lucy's brother, comes by to pick her up. Laura returns to collect her inheritance, and asks Ace to move with her to [[Paris]]. Nancy moves ahead with her plan to find out who really killed Lucy by having Ace hack her old email account, which turns up messages between her and Ryan that reveal they were supposed to meet the night she died. Bess becomes concerned that Amaya has a romantic interest in her, which George tells her to break off. Nancy brings the group, Laura, Karen, and Ryan to the diner, where she has them reenact the events leading up to Tiffany's murder. The reenactment leads to a major breakthrough: a poisoned salad that was prepared for Ryan was instead served to Tiffany. Nancy takes this as evidence that the murder was revenge for Ryan killing Lucy; Ryan flees after he sees Lucy's ghost. Nancy visits Joshua to check Lucy's old computer, but quickly deduces he poisoned the salad. When he tries to kill her, he accidentally electrocutes himself. Ace ends things with Laura before she leaves.

She and Owen speak to Ryan's old roommate for information on him and Lucy. Nick and Ace visit Ace's father, who has come out of retirement to rejoin the force, and learn that the poison used to kill Tiffany was stolen from police evidence. Nancy correctly deduces that Joshua had an accomplice: Karen. Despite her arrest, however, Carson informs her he needs actual physical evidence to clear his name. Owen, George, and Bess go the Historical Society and conduct research on the Agleaca, a spirit that supposedly grants the heart's desire of whoever summons it, but for a price. The group performs the summoning ritual, and the Agleaca grants Nancy's wish by delivering her Lucy's bones. In return, it attempts to claim Owen's life, forcing George to break the summoning wreath. Ace stashes the bones, Nick accepts George's offer to spend the night at her home, and Owen and Nancy sleep together.

Nick and George manage to hide the bones in time, but the experience causes friction between them. Nancy picks up Ryan and takes him along with her as she questions several witnesses, including Everett and Karen, to try and piece together Lucy's final hours. They visit her childhood home and find her diary hidden in the walls. When Nancy has to testify at her father's trial, she reveals the truth: Lucy committed suicide out of despair when Everett forced her to end things with Ryan. Carson is cleared of all charges. While cleaning the diner, George and Nick give into their feelings and kiss. Bess finds one of the bones is missing, unaware that Det. Tamura found it.

The only problem is that for the ritual to work, Nancy must offer her both her blood and that of a blood relative. She tries to get Ryan to help by agreeing to assist him in his effort to learn about his missing child. However, when Ryan admits he doesn't want to help Owen, Nancy barrages him with insults and he angrily drives off without her. At Diana Marvin's birthday party, Bess is told that she will be expected to extract information from Lisbeth about her police work in exchange for her family's approval of their relationship. Ryan deduces the truth and confronts Nancy; she confesses that she doesn't want him to be her father. Ryan nevertheless holds up his end of the bargain and takes part in the ritual. Unfortunately, the visions only get worse. Nancy suggests, and Victoria confirms, that the Agleaca was once a human who was wrongfully executed, and is now enraged and desires blood.

Others settlers came, and in 1837 they held a lottery to determine who would name the town. Alexander Gardiner won and named the town Dundee in honor of his [[Dundee|Scottish hometown]], with which West Dundee is now sister cities.<ref>http://www.sister-cities.org/interactive-map/West%20Dundee,%20Illinois</ref> In 1843 Scotsman [[Allan Pinkerton]], later the renowned detective, set up business as a cooper. The town was incorporated in 1887.\n\nDundee was hemmed in from development for years. The [[Fox River (Illinois River tributary)|Fox River]] formed a natural eastern barrier. To the north and west, the D. Hill Nursery, founded in 1855 by William Hill, specialized in fruit trees. The business grew to include evergreens, some of which were sent to [[Chicago]] for the [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in 1893. Expanding to 900 acres, the nursery survived the [[Great Depression]] by running a cattle feed operation that continued through [[World War II]]. Some of the thousands of seasonal workers traveled to work from Chicago by electric rail, while the majority lived on the nursery grounds.\n\nIn the 1950s, a segment of the Hill property was sold and turned into the Highlands subdivision, which was annexed into West Dundee in 1956. The community also annexed property west of Illinois 31 in 1957, Royal Lane in 1960, and the Old World subdivision in 1966. The nursery eventually sold all of its land and moved to [[McHenry County, Illinois|McHenry County]]. Plans for the [[Spring Hill Mall]] on Hill's land began in 1973 and the project was completed in 1980. The 1.1 million-square-foot mall's retail sales boosted West Dundee's economy and created an estimated 1,600 jobs by 1982. New subdivisions were built to the west of Spring Hill Mall.\n\nWith a population of 7,331 (2010 Census data), West Dundee has managed to keep its quaintness and small-town feeling intact.
