A pene-exclave can also exist entirely on land, such as when intervening mountains render a territory inaccessible from other parts of a country except through alien territory. A commonly cited example is the [[Kleinwalsertal]], a valley part of [[Vorarlberg]], Austria, that is accessible only from Germany to the north.\n\n==Origin and usage==\nThe word ''enclave'' is French and first appeared in the mid-15th century as a derivative of the verb ''enclaver'' (1283), from the colloquial Latin ''inclavare'' (to close with a key).<ref name=\"LGR\">Le Grand Robert, ''Dictionnaire de la Langue Fran\u00e7aise'', 2001, vol.&nbsp;III, p.&nbsp;946.</ref> Originally, it was a term of property law that denoted the situation of a land or parcel of land surrounded by land owned by a different owner, and that could not be reached for its exploitation in a practical and sufficient manner without crossing the surrounding land.<ref name=\"LGR\"/> In law, this created a ''servitude''<ref>{{cite dictionary |quote=Servitude: '''Law'''. ''A right possessed by one person with respect to another's property, consisting either of a right to use the other's property, or a power to prevent certain uses of it''. |title=Webster's Encyclopedic Unabridged Dictionary of the English Language |year=1989 |page=1304}}</ref> of passage for the benefit of the owner of the surrounded land. The first diplomatic document to contain the word ''enclave'' was the [[Treaty of Madrid (1526)|Treaty of Madrid]], signed in 1526.<ref name=\"Melamid\">{{cite news |first=Alexander |last=Melamid |title=Enclaves and Exclaves |encyclopedia=International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences |volume=5 |year=1968 |editor-first=David |editor-last=Sills |publisher=The Macmillan Company & Free Press}}</ref>{{rp|61}}\n\nLater, the term enclave began to be used also to refer to parcels of countries, counties, fiefs, communes, towns, parishes, etc. that were surrounded by alien territory. This French word eventually entered the English and other languages to denote the same concept, although local terms have continued to be used. In India, the word \"pocket\" is often used as a synonym for enclave (such as \"the pockets of Puducherry district\").<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jobresultsnic.in/2014/12/bsnl-recruitment-2014-2015-apply-for.html |title=Government Jobs in BSNL : 01 Jobs Opening |publisher=jobresultsnic.in |accessdate=2014-02-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141224165814/http://www.jobresultsnic.in/2014/12/bsnl-recruitment-2014-2015-apply-for.html |archivedate=2014-12-24 }}</ref> In British administrative history, subnational enclaves were usually called '''detachments''' or '''detached parts''', and national enclaves as '''detached districts''' or '''detached dominions'''.<ref>As can be seen on 18th. century maps of Germany and other European countries by British cartographers and publishers such as R. Wilkinson.</ref> In English [[ecclesiology|ecclesiastic]] history, subnational enclaves were known as '''peculiars''' (see also [[Royal Peculiar]]).\n\nThe word ''exclave''<ref name=Websters_p497/> is a [[Extension (semantics)|logically extended]] [[back-formation]] of ''enclave''.\n\n==Characteristics==\n<!--PNG images containing transparencies do not display properly for some users.

For example, in the [[feudal system]] in Europe, the ownership of feudal domains was often transferred or partitioned, either through purchase and sale or through inheritance, and often such domains were or came to be surrounded by other domains. In particular, this state of affairs persisted into the 19th century in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and these domains (principalities, etc.) exhibited many of the characteristics of sovereign states. Prior to 1866 Prussia alone consisted of more than 270 discontiguous pieces of territory.<ref name=\"Melamid\"/>{{rp|61}}\n\nResiding in an enclave within another country has often involved difficulties in such areas as passage rights, importing goods, currency, provision of utilities and health services, and host nation cooperation. Thus, over time, enclaves have tended to be eliminated. For example, two-thirds of the then-existing national-level enclaves were extinguished on August 1, 2015, when the governments of [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] implemented a Land Boundary Agreement that exchanged 162 first-order enclaves (111 Indian and 51 Bangladeshi). This exchange thus effectively de-enclaved another two dozen second-order enclaves and one third-order enclave, eliminating 197 of the [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves]] in all. The residents in these enclaves had complained of being effectively stateless. Only Bangladesh's [[Dahagram\u2013Angarpota]] enclave remained.\n\n[[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] though decided to keep the enclave and exclave system in [[Baarle]]. As both Netherlands and Belgium are members of the [[European Union]] and [[Schengen Area]], people, goods and services flow freely with little or no restrictions. \n\n===Enclave versus exclave===\nFor illustration, in the figure (above), A1 is a '''semi-enclave''' (attached to C and also bounded by water that only touches C's territorial water). Although A2 is an exclave of A, it cannot be classed as an enclave because it shares borders with B and C. The territory A3 is both an exclave of A and an enclave from the viewpoint of B. The singular territory D, although an enclave, is not an exclave.\n\n==True enclaves==\n{{Further|List of enclaves and exclaves}}\n\nAn enclave is a part of the territory of a state that is enclosed within the territory of another state. To distinguish the parts of a state entirely enclosed in a single other state, they are called '''true enclaves'''.<ref name=\"EV\"/>{{rp|10}} A true enclave cannot be reached without passing through the territory of a single other state that surrounds it. ''Vinokurov (2007)'' calls this the restrictive definition of \"enclave\" given by international law, which thus \"comprises only so-called 'true enclaves'\".<ref name=\"EV\">{{cite book |first=Evgeny |last=Vinokurov |title = The Theory of Enclaves |year = 2007 |publisher = Lexington Books, Lanham, MD}}</ref>{{rp|10}} Two examples are [[B\u00fcsingen am Hochrhein]], a true enclave of Germany, and [[Campione d'Italia]], a true enclave of Italy, both of which are surrounded by Switzerland.\n\nThe definition of a territory comprises both land territory and territorial waters. In the case of enclaves in territorial waters, they are called maritime (those surrounded by territorial sea) or lacustrine (if in a lake) enclaves.<ref name=\"EV\"/>{{rp|10}} Most of the true national-level enclaves now existing are in Asia and Europe. While subnational enclaves are numerous the world over, there are only a few national-level true enclaves in Africa, Australia and the Americas (each such enclave being surrounded by the territorial waters of another country).\n\nAn historical example is [[West Berlin]] before the reunification of [[Germany]]. Since 1945, all of Berlin was ruled ''de jure'' by the four Allied powers. However, the East German government and the [[Soviet Union]] treated East Berlin as an integral part of East Germany, so West Berlin was a ''de facto'' enclave within [[East Germany]]. Also, 12 small West Berlin enclaves, such as [[Steinst\u00fccken]], were separated from the city, some by only a few meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://berlin.enclaves.org/ |title=Berlin Exclaves |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>\n\n===Enclaved countries===\n[[File:LocationLesotho.svg|thumb|Position of [[Lesotho]] within [[South Africa]]]]\n{{see also|List of countries that border only one other country}}\nThree nations qualify as completely surrounded by another country's land and/or internal waters:  \n* The Republic of [[San Marino]], enclaved within [[Italy]]\n* [[Vatican City]], enclaved within the city of [[Rome]], Italy\n* The Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], enclaved within [[South Africa]]\n\nThe [[Republic of Artsakh]], a disputed territory not recognised by any [[UN member states]], consists of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], which was an enclave within [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|territories]] bordering [[Armenia]] and [[Iran]] that were conquered during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].\n\nHistorically, four [[Bantustans]] (or \"Black homelands\") of South Africa were granted nominal independence, unrecognized internationally, by the [[Apartheid]]ist government from 1976 until their reabsorption in 1994. Others remained under government rule from 1948 to 1994. Being heavily partitioned, various parts of these Bantustans were true enclaves.\n\nThe United States' constitutional principle of [[tribal sovereignty]] treats federally-recognized [[Indian reservation]]s as quasi-independent enclaves.\n\n===Temporary enclaves===\nTo establish jurisdiction, the [[Scottish Court in the Netherlands]], at Camp Zeist near [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], was temporarily declared as sovereign territory of the [[United Kingdom]] under [[Scots law]] for the duration of the trial of those accused in the [[Lockerbie bombing]], and was therefore an exclave of the United Kingdom and of [[Scotland]], and an enclave within the Netherlands.

Along with Transylvania, it became a part of Romania in 1920, according with the [[Treaty of Trianon]] signed on 4 June 1920 at the Grand Trianon Palace in Versailles, France. In 1938\u20131940, during [[World War II]], post-Trianon Hungary temporarily expanded its territory and included some additional territories that were formerly part of the pre-war Kingdom of Hungary, under [[Third Reich]] auspices, the [[Second Vienna Award]]. It was later reduced to boundaries approximating those of 1920 by the peace treaties signed after World War II at Paris, in 1947. The area was called [[Magyar Autonomous Region]] between September 8, 1952 and February 16, 1968, a Hungarian autonomous region within Romania, and today there are [[Sz\u00e9kely autonomy initiatives|territorial autonomy initiatives]] to reach a higher level of self-governance for this region within Romania.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n* There are several [[Kosovo Serb enclaves|Serb enclaves in Kosovo]] where the institutions of [[Kosovo]] are not fully operational due to disputes.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Extraterritoriality===\nDiplomatic missions, such as embassies and consulates, as well as military bases, are usually exempted from the jurisdiction of the host country, i.e., the laws of the host nation in which an embassy is located do not typically apply to the land of the embassy or base itself. This exemption from the jurisdiction of the host country is defined as [[extraterritoriality]]. Areas and buildings enjoying some forms of extraterritoriality are not true enclaves since, in all cases, the host country retains full sovereignty. In addition to embassies, some other areas enjoy a limited form of extraterritoriality.\n\nExamples of this include:\n* [[Pavillon de Breteuil]] in [[France]], used by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]].\n* [[United Nations headquarters]] in the [[United States]], used by the [[United Nations]].\n* [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]], used by the [[United Nations]].\n* [[INTERPOL]] headquarters in [[Lyon]], [[France]], used by [[INTERPOL]].\n* [[NATO]] (political) headquarters near [[Evere]] in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], a part of the [[City of Brussels]], [[Belgium]].\n* Headquarters of [[Allied Command Operations]] ([[NATO]]) at the area designated as [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE), north of [[Mons]], [[Belgium]].\n* [[Palazzo Malta]] and the [[Villa del Priorato di Malta]], the headquarters of [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] in Rome. In addition to extraterritoriality, Italy recognizes the exercise by SMOM of all the prerogatives of sovereignty in its headquarters.

Most instances are exempt from taxes. In the special case of embassies/consulates these enjoy special privileges driven by [[international law|international consensus]] particularly the mutual wish to ensure free [[diplomatic mission]]s, such as being exempt from major hindrances and host-country arrests in ordinary times on the premises. Most non-embassy lands in such ownership are also not enclaves as they fall legally short of ''extraterritoriality'', they are subject to alike court jurisdiction as before their grant/sale in most matters. Nonetheless, for a person's offence against the property itself, [[habeas corpus|equally valid jurisdiction]] in criminal matters is more likely than elsewhere, assuming the perpetrator is found in the prosecuting authority's homeland. Devoid of permanent residents, formally defined new [[sovereignty]] is not warranted or asserted in the examples below. Nonetheless, minor laws, especially on [[flag flying days in the United Kingdom|flag flying]], are sometimes relaxed to accommodate the needs of the accommodated nation's monument.\n\n[[Embassy|Embassies]] enjoy many different legal statuses approaching quasi-sovereignty, depending on the agreements reached and in practice upheld from time-to-time by host nations. Subject to hosts adhering to basic due process of [[international law]], including giving warnings, the enforced reduction of scope of a foreign embassy has always been a possibility, even to the point of expelling the foreign embassy entirely, usually on a breakdown of relations, in reaction to extreme actions such as [[espionage]], or as another form of sanction. The same seems to be possible in profit-driven moving or drilling under any of the sites below, providing safeguards as the structure or a new replacement site. The same possible curtailments and alterations never apply to proper exclaves.\n\nExamples of such land other than for diplomatic missions are:\n* [[Napoleon]]'s original grave in [[Longwood, Saint Helena]], owned by [[France]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domfrance.helanta.sh/ |title=domaines fran\u00e7ais de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne |publisher=Domfrance.helanta.sh |accessdate=2012-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325102630/http://www.domfrance.helanta.sh/ |archivedate=2011-03-25 }}</ref>\n* [[Victor Hugo]]'s house in [[Saint Peter Port]] (Saint-Pierre-Port), [[Guernsey]], owned by the city of [[Paris]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/portail/loisirs/Portal.lut?page_id=5852&document_type_id=5&document_id=77553&portlet_id=12988 |title=Guernesey : Hauteville House |publisher=Paris.fr |date=2012-08-28 |accessdate=2012-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626002054/http://www.paris.fr/portail/loisirs/Portal.lut?page_id=5852&document_type_id=5&document_id=77553&portlet_id=12988 |archivedate=2010-06-26 }}</ref>\n* The Brest memorial in [[Brest, France]] is owned by the U.S. It commemorates [[World War I]].\n* The [[Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial]] in Normandy, [[France]], which contains the graves of 9,386 American military dead, most of whom died during the landings and ensuing operations of World War II, owned by the [[United States of America]].<ref name=ABMC>Source:[http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries/cemeteries/no.php American Battle Monument Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126030757/http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries/cemeteries/no.php |date=2005-11-26 }}</ref>\n* [[Pointe du Hoc]], the 13-hectare site of a memorial and museum dedicated to the World War II [[Normandy landing]] at [[Omaha Beach]], France transferred to the U.S. on 11 January 1979.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.150th.com/letters/btl_monu.htm |title=The American Battle Monuments Commission |accessdate=October 29, 2012 |publisher= The site, preserved since the war by the French Committee of the Pointe du Hoc, which erected an impressive granite monument at the edge of the cliff, was transferred to American control by formal agreement between the two governments on 11 January 1979 in Paris, with Ambassador Arthur A.

For example, in the [[feudal system]] in Europe, the ownership of feudal domains was often transferred or partitioned, either through purchase and sale or through inheritance, and often such domains were or came to be surrounded by other domains. In particular, this state of affairs persisted into the 19th century in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and these domains (principalities, etc.) exhibited many of the characteristics of sovereign states. Prior to 1866 Prussia alone consisted of more than 270 discontiguous pieces of territory.<ref name=\"Melamid\"/>{{rp|61}}\n\nResiding in an enclave within another country has often involved difficulties in such areas as passage rights, importing goods, currency, provision of utilities and health services, and host nation cooperation. Thus, over time, enclaves have tended to be eliminated. For example, two-thirds of the then-existing national-level enclaves were extinguished on August 1, 2015, when the governments of [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] implemented a Land Boundary Agreement that exchanged 162 first-order enclaves (111 Indian and 51 Bangladeshi). This exchange thus effectively de-enclaved another two dozen second-order enclaves and one third-order enclave, eliminating 197 of the [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves]] in all. The residents in these enclaves had complained of being effectively stateless. Only Bangladesh's [[Dahagram\u2013Angarpota]] enclave remained.\n\n[[Netherlands]] and [[Belgium]] though decided to keep the enclave and exclave system in [[Baarle]]. As both Netherlands and Belgium are members of the [[European Union]] and [[Schengen Area]], people, goods and services flow freely with little or no restrictions. \n\n===Enclave versus exclave===\nFor illustration, in the figure (above), A1 is a '''semi-enclave''' (attached to C and also bounded by water that only touches C's territorial water). Although A2 is an exclave of A, it cannot be classed as an enclave because it shares borders with B and C. The territory A3 is both an exclave of A and an enclave from the viewpoint of B. The singular territory D, although an enclave, is not an exclave.\n\n==True enclaves==\n{{Further|List of enclaves and exclaves}}\n\nAn enclave is a part of the territory of a state that is enclosed within the territory of another state. To distinguish the parts of a state entirely enclosed in a single other state, they are called '''true enclaves'''.<ref name=\"EV\"/>{{rp|10}} A true enclave cannot be reached without passing through the territory of a single other state that surrounds it. ''Vinokurov (2007)'' calls this the restrictive definition of \"enclave\" given by international law, which thus \"comprises only so-called 'true enclaves'\".<ref name=\"EV\">{{cite book |first=Evgeny |last=Vinokurov |title = The Theory of Enclaves |year = 2007 |publisher = Lexington Books, Lanham, MD}}</ref>{{rp|10}} Two examples are [[B\u00fcsingen am Hochrhein]], a true enclave of Germany, and [[Campione d'Italia]], a true enclave of Italy, both of which are surrounded by Switzerland.\n\nThe definition of a territory comprises both land territory and territorial waters. In the case of enclaves in territorial waters, they are called maritime (those surrounded by territorial sea) or lacustrine (if in a lake) enclaves.<ref name=\"EV\"/>{{rp|10}} Most of the true national-level enclaves now existing are in Asia and Europe. While subnational enclaves are numerous the world over, there are only a few national-level true enclaves in Africa, Australia and the Americas (each such enclave being surrounded by the territorial waters of another country).\n\nAn historical example is [[West Berlin]] before the reunification of [[Germany]]. Since 1945, all of Berlin was ruled ''de jure'' by the four Allied powers. However, the East German government and the [[Soviet Union]] treated East Berlin as an integral part of East Germany, so West Berlin was a ''de facto'' enclave within [[East Germany]]. Also, 12 small West Berlin enclaves, such as [[Steinst\u00fccken]], were separated from the city, some by only a few meters.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://berlin.enclaves.org/ |title=Berlin Exclaves |accessdate=2013-05-02}}</ref>\n\n===Enclaved countries===\n[[File:LocationLesotho.svg|thumb|Position of [[Lesotho]] within [[South Africa]]]]\n{{see also|List of countries that border only one other country}}\nThree nations qualify as completely surrounded by another country's land and/or internal waters:  \n* The Republic of [[San Marino]], enclaved within [[Italy]]\n* [[Vatican City]], enclaved within the city of [[Rome]], Italy\n* The Kingdom of [[Lesotho]], enclaved within [[South Africa]]\n\nThe [[Republic of Artsakh]], a disputed territory not recognised by any [[UN member states]], consists of [[Nagorno-Karabakh]], which was an enclave within [[Azerbaijan]], and [[Armenian-controlled territories surrounding Nagorno-Karabakh|territories]] bordering [[Armenia]] and [[Iran]] that were conquered during the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].\n\nHistorically, four [[Bantustans]] (or \"Black homelands\") of South Africa were granted nominal independence, unrecognized internationally, by the [[Apartheid]]ist government from 1976 until their reabsorption in 1994. Others remained under government rule from 1948 to 1994. Being heavily partitioned, various parts of these Bantustans were true enclaves.\n\nThe United States' constitutional principle of [[tribal sovereignty]] treats federally-recognized [[Indian reservation]]s as quasi-independent enclaves.\n\n===Temporary enclaves===\nTo establish jurisdiction, the [[Scottish Court in the Netherlands]], at Camp Zeist near [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]], was temporarily declared as sovereign territory of the [[United Kingdom]] under [[Scots law]] for the duration of the trial of those accused in the [[Lockerbie bombing]], and was therefore an exclave of the United Kingdom and of [[Scotland]], and an enclave within the Netherlands.

In the past, when there was no road network serving the region, the residents commonly travelled by boat to [[Tai Po Market]] for their daily lives, hence the districts were drawn this way, but now most of the ferries no longer exists and residents travel by road to markets in [[Sha Tin District]] (Ma On Shan or Sha Tin) instead.\n* In the United States:\n** Several portions of land on the [[New Jersey]] side of the [[Delaware River]] belong to [[Delaware]]. Within the [[Twelve-Mile Circle]], Delaware's border extends to the low-water mark across the river. South of the Circle, the Delaware-New Jersey border follows the middle of the river and bay.\n** The [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] on the southern portion of the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] shares a border with [[Maryland]] but is only connected to the rest of [[Virginia]] by the [[Chesapeake Bay Bridge-Tunnel]], which is part of [[U.S. Route 13]]. \n** The city of [[Carter Lake, Iowa]] is separated from the rest of the state of [[Iowa]] by the [[Missouri River]], which changed course during a flood in 1877, cutting the city off from the rest of the state. It is now only accessible through [[Omaha]], [[Nebraska]].\n** The village of [[Kaskaskia, Illinois]], the state's first capital, is separated from the rest of Illinois by the [[Mississippi River]] due to a flood in 1881, which shifted the river to flow east of the town, rather than west. This resulted in the only access to the town being from [[Missouri]].\n** The [[Upper Peninsula]] of [[Michigan]] is separated from the [[Lower Peninsula]] by the [[Straits of Mackinac]], so until the [[Mackinac Bridge]] was completed in 1957, the only land routes between them were through the states of [[Wisconsin]], [[Illinois]], and [[Indiana]], or through the Canadian province of [[Ontario]].\n** The [[Marble Hill, Manhattan|Marble Hill]] neighborhood of [[Manhattan]] is separated from the rest of the borough by the [[Harlem River]].\n\n===Enclaves within enclaves===\n[[File:Baarle-Nassau - Baarle-Hertog-en.svg|thumb|Map showing the non-contiguous [[Belgium|Belgian]] exclaves of [[Baarle-Hertog]] in the [[Netherlands]] which, in turn, has Dutch enclaves within it]]\n[[File:Cooch-behar-enclaves-schematisch.png|thumb|[[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves]] created by the 1947 [[Partition of India]]]]\nIt is possible for an enclave of one country to be completely surrounded by a part of another country that is itself an enclave of the first country. These enclaves are sometimes called ''counter-enclaves''.\n*The Dutch municipality of [[Baarle-Nassau]] has seven exclaves in two exclaves of the Belgian municipality of [[Baarle-Hertog]].\n*The former complex of enclaves at [[Cooch Behar district]] included 24 second-order enclaves and one small '''third-order enclave''' called ''[[Dahala Khagrabari|Dahala Khagrabari #51]]'': a piece of India within Bangladesh, within India, within Bangladesh. The [[Indo-Bangladesh enclaves]] were exchanged on 31 July 2015 by the ratified Land Boundary Agreement, and Dahala Khagrabari was ceded to Bangladesh.\n* [[Nahwa]] of the [[United Arab Emirates]] is surrounded by [[Madha]], an exclave of Oman within the U.A.E.\n\n===Ethnic enclaves===\nAn [[ethnic enclave]] is a community of an ethnic group inside an area in which another ethnic group predominates. [[Ghetto]]s, [[Little Italy]]s, [[barrio]]s and [[Chinatown]]s are examples. These areas may have a separate language, culture and economic system.\n* [[Sz\u00e9kely Land]] is a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] ethnic enclave within [[Romania]], with its people calling themselves [[Sz\u00e9kely]]. Originally, the name ''Sz\u00e9kely Land'' denoted an autonomous region within [[Transylvania]]. It existed as a legal entity from medieval times until the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], when the Sz\u00e9kely and [[Transylvanian Saxons|Saxon]] seats were dissolved and replaced by the [[Comitatus (Kingdom of Hungary)#Modernised counties (1867\u20131918)|county system]]. Along with Transylvania, it became a part of Romania in 1920, according with the [[Treaty of Trianon]] signed on 4 June 1920 at the Grand Trianon Palace in Versailles, France. In 1938\u20131940, during [[World War II]], post-Trianon Hungary temporarily expanded its territory and included some additional territories that were formerly part of the pre-war Kingdom of Hungary, under [[Third Reich]] auspices, the [[Second Vienna Award]]. It was later reduced to boundaries approximating those of 1920 by the peace treaties signed after World War II at Paris, in 1947. The area was called [[Magyar Autonomous Region]] between September 8, 1952 and February 16, 1968, a Hungarian autonomous region within Romania, and today there are [[Sz\u00e9kely autonomy initiatives|territorial autonomy initiatives]] to reach a higher level of self-governance for this region within Romania.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n* There are several [[Kosovo Serb enclaves|Serb enclaves in Kosovo]] where the institutions of [[Kosovo]] are not fully operational due to disputes.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n===Extraterritoriality===\nDiplomatic missions, such as embassies and consulates, as well as military bases, are usually exempted from the jurisdiction of the host country, i.e., the laws of the host nation in which an embassy is located do not typically apply to the land of the embassy or base itself. This exemption from the jurisdiction of the host country is defined as [[extraterritoriality]]. Areas and buildings enjoying some forms of extraterritoriality are not true enclaves since, in all cases, the host country retains full sovereignty. In addition to embassies, some other areas enjoy a limited form of extraterritoriality.\n\nExamples of this include:\n* [[Pavillon de Breteuil]] in [[France]], used by the [[General Conference on Weights and Measures]].\n* [[United Nations headquarters]] in the [[United States]], used by the [[United Nations]].\n* [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] in [[Switzerland]], used by the [[United Nations]].\n* [[INTERPOL]] headquarters in [[Lyon]], [[France]], used by [[INTERPOL]].\n* [[NATO]] (political) headquarters near [[Evere]] in [[Haren, Belgium|Haren]], a part of the [[City of Brussels]], [[Belgium]].\n* Headquarters of [[Allied Command Operations]] ([[NATO]]) at the area designated as [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe]] (SHAPE), north of [[Mons]], [[Belgium]].\n* [[Palazzo Malta]] and the [[Villa del Priorato di Malta]], the headquarters of [[Sovereign Military Order of Malta]] in Rome. In addition to extraterritoriality, Italy recognizes the exercise by SMOM of all the prerogatives of sovereignty in its headquarters. Therefore, Italian sovereignty and SMOM sovereignty uniquely coexist without overlapping.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9LDb9lFYjVPUnFkaUVjVVdVUnM/view?usp=sharing |publisher=Anal\u00edtica.com |location=Caracas, Distrito Capital, Venezuela |accessdate=October 1, 2012 |last=Arocha |first=Magaly |title= La Orden de Malta y su Naturaleza Jur\u00eddica (The Order of Malta and Its Legal Nature) |date=May 1999}}</ref>\n* [[Properties of the Holy See|Extraterritorial properties of the Holy See]] in Rome and surroundings.\n* By treaty of 2 November 1929, [[Czechoslovakia]] obtained the lease for 99 years of two plots of land (in the [[Moldauhafen]] and in the [[Saalehafen]]), both within the perimeter of the free port of [[Hamburg]].

Russian law is in principle valid, but in reality Finland maintains the area.\n\n===Land owned by a foreign country===\n[[File:Cook Monument Kealakekua.jpg|thumb|Land for the [[Kealakekua Bay|Captain Cook Monument]] was deeded outright to the British government by the independent nation of Hawaii in 1877]]\nOne or more parcels/holdings of land in most countries is owned by other countries. Most instances are exempt from taxes. In the special case of embassies/consulates these enjoy special privileges driven by [[international law|international consensus]] particularly the mutual wish to ensure free [[diplomatic mission]]s, such as being exempt from major hindrances and host-country arrests in ordinary times on the premises. Most non-embassy lands in such ownership are also not enclaves as they fall legally short of ''extraterritoriality'', they are subject to alike court jurisdiction as before their grant/sale in most matters. Nonetheless, for a person's offence against the property itself, [[habeas corpus|equally valid jurisdiction]] in criminal matters is more likely than elsewhere, assuming the perpetrator is found in the prosecuting authority's homeland. Devoid of permanent residents, formally defined new [[sovereignty]] is not warranted or asserted in the examples below. Nonetheless, minor laws, especially on [[flag flying days in the United Kingdom|flag flying]], are sometimes relaxed to accommodate the needs of the accommodated nation's monument.\n\n[[Embassy|Embassies]] enjoy many different legal statuses approaching quasi-sovereignty, depending on the agreements reached and in practice upheld from time-to-time by host nations. Subject to hosts adhering to basic due process of [[international law]], including giving warnings, the enforced reduction of scope of a foreign embassy has always been a possibility, even to the point of expelling the foreign embassy entirely, usually on a breakdown of relations, in reaction to extreme actions such as [[espionage]], or as another form of sanction. The same seems to be possible in profit-driven moving or drilling under any of the sites below, providing safeguards as the structure or a new replacement site. The same possible curtailments and alterations never apply to proper exclaves.\n\nExamples of such land other than for diplomatic missions are:\n* [[Napoleon]]'s original grave in [[Longwood, Saint Helena]], owned by [[France]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.domfrance.helanta.sh/ |title=domaines fran\u00e7ais de Sainte-H\u00e9l\u00e8ne |publisher=Domfrance.helanta.sh |accessdate=2012-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110325102630/http://www.domfrance.helanta.sh/ |archivedate=2011-03-25 }}</ref>\n* [[Victor Hugo]]'s house in [[Saint Peter Port]] (Saint-Pierre-Port), [[Guernsey]], owned by the city of [[Paris]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.paris.fr/portail/loisirs/Portal.lut?page_id=5852&document_type_id=5&document_id=77553&portlet_id=12988 |title=Guernesey : Hauteville House |publisher=Paris.fr |date=2012-08-28 |accessdate=2012-09-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626002054/http://www.paris.fr/portail/loisirs/Portal.lut?page_id=5852&document_type_id=5&document_id=77553&portlet_id=12988 |archivedate=2010-06-26 }}</ref>\n* The Brest memorial in [[Brest, France]] is owned by the U.S. It commemorates [[World War I]].\n* The [[Normandy American Cemetery and Memorial]] in Normandy, [[France]], which contains the graves of 9,386 American military dead, most of whom died during the landings and ensuing operations of World War II, owned by the [[United States of America]].<ref name=ABMC>Source:[http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries/cemeteries/no.php American Battle Monument Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126030757/http://www.abmc.gov/cemeteries/cemeteries/no.php |date=2005-11-26 }}</ref>\n* [[Pointe du Hoc]], the 13-hectare site of a memorial and museum dedicated to the World War II [[Normandy landing]] at [[Omaha Beach]], France transferred to the U.S. on 11 January 1979.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.150th.com/letters/btl_monu.htm |title=The American Battle Monuments Commission |accessdate=October 29, 2012 |publisher= The site, preserved since the war by the French Committee of the Pointe du Hoc, which erected an impressive granite monument at the edge of the cliff, was transferred to American control by formal agreement between the two governments on 11 January 1979 in Paris, with Ambassador Arthur A.

Porkkala is located on the [[Rantarata]], the main railway line between [[Helsinki]] and [[Turku]]. Initially, only Soviet traffic was permitted through, forcing [[VR Group|Finnish State Railways]] to reroute the trains through a circuitous route via [[Toijala]]. However, in 1947, the Soviets agreed to let Finnish trains through. At the border, Finnish trains were shunted to a Soviet locomotive, windows were shuttered, guards were posted to the doors, and the Soviet locomotive would pull the train through the base area, to be shunted back to a Finnish locomotive at the opposite border.\n\nProposals\n* The shortest and straightest route for a proposed east\u2013west high-speed railway in Austria through [[Linz]], [[Salzburg]] and [[Innsbruck]] would pass under some mountains belonging to Germany.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\n====Africa====\n[[File:Map Mauritania Railway.png|thumb|The [[Mauritania Railway]].
