Analysis of this anecdotal evidence has supported the original consensus that ASMR is euphoric but non-sexual in nature, and has divided those who experience ASMR into two broad categories of subjects. One category depends upon external triggers to experience the localized sensation and its associated feelings, which typically originates in the head, often reaching down the neck and sometimes the upper back. The other category can intentionally augment the sensation and feelings through [[attentional control]], without dependence upon external stimuli, or 'triggers', in a manner compared by some subjects to their experience of [[meditation]].<ref name=\"slate.com\">O'Connell, Mark (12 February 2013).

Additionally, ASMR is often triggered by exposure to specific audio and video. Such media may be specially made with the specific purpose of triggering ASMR or originally created for other purposes and later discovered to be effective as a trigger of the experience.<ref name=\"Barratt2015\"/>\n\n[[Stimulus (physiology)|Stimuli]] that can trigger ASMR, as reported by those who experience it, include the following:\n* Listening to a softly spoken or whispering voice\n* Listening to quiet, repetitive sounds resulting from someone engaging in a mundane task such as turning the pages of a book\n* Watching somebody attentively execute a mundane task such as preparing food\n* Loudly chewing, crunching, slurping or biting foods, drinks, or gum\n* Receiving personal attention\n* Initiating the stimulus through conscious manipulation without the need for external video or audio triggers\n* Listening to tapping, typically nails onto surfaces such as plastic, wood, metal, etc.\n* Hand movements, especially onto one's face\n* Listening to certain types of music\n* Listening to a person blow or exhale into a microphone\n\nA 2017 study of 130 survey respondents found that lower-pitched, complex sounds, and slow-paced, detail-focused videos are especially effective triggers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barratt |first1=EL |last2=Spence |first2=C |last3=Davis |first3=NJ |title=Sensory determinants of the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR): understanding the triggers. |journal=PeerJ |date=2017 |volume=5 |pages=e3846 |doi=10.7717/peerj.3846 |pmid=29018601 |pmc=5633022}}</ref>\n\n===Whispering===\nPsychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barratt discovered that whispering was an effective trigger for 75% of the 475 subjects who took part in an experiment to investigate the nature of ASMR;<ref name=\"Barratt2015\"/> this statistic is reflected in the popularity of intentional ASMR videos that comprise someone speaking in a whispered voice.<ref name=\"Manduley2013\"/><ref name=\"ASMR videos - soothing or creepy?\"/><ref name=\"I have ASMR, do you?\"/>\n\n===Auditory===\nMany of those who experience ASMR report that non-vocal [[ambient noise]]s performed through human action are also effective triggers of ASMR. Examples of such noises include fingers scratching or tapping a surface, brushing hair, hands rubbing together or manipulating fabric, the crushing of eggshells, the crinkling and crumpling of a flexible material such as paper, or writing.

By distinction, when listening to sound through headphones, the sound from the left earpiece is audible only to the left ear, and the sound from the right ear piece is audible only to the right ear.

On 12 March 2012, [[Steven Novella]], Director of General Neurology at the [[Yale School of Medicine]], published a post about ASMR on his blog ''Neurologica''. Regarding the question of whether ASMR is a real phenomenon, Novella said \"in this case, I don't think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is. There are a number of people who seem to have independently experienced and described\" it with \"fairly specific details. In this way it's similar to migraine headaches \u2013 we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history.\" Novella tentatively posited the possibilities that ASMR might be either a type of pleasurable seizure or another way to activate the \"pleasure response\". However, Novella drew attention to the lack of scientific investigation into ASMR, suggesting that [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] technologies should be used to study the brains of people who experience ASMR in comparison to people who do not, as a way of beginning to seek scientific understanding and explanation of the phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/asmr/ |title=ASMR |work=Neurologica Blog |publisher=[[New England Skeptical Society]] |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/03/12/asmr/ |title=ASMR |website=Skepticblog.org |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nFour months after Novella's blog post, Tom Stafford, a lecturer in [[psychology]] and cognitive sciences at the [[University of Sheffield]], was reported to have said that ASMR \"might well be a real thing, but it's inherently difficult to research...something like this that you can't see or feel\" and \"doesn't happen for everyone\".

One category depends upon external triggers to experience the localized sensation and its associated feelings, which typically originates in the head, often reaching down the neck and sometimes the upper back.

Additionally, ASMR is often triggered by exposure to specific audio and video. Such media may be specially made with the specific purpose of triggering ASMR or originally created for other purposes and later discovered to be effective as a trigger of the experience.<ref name=\"Barratt2015\"/>\n\n[[Stimulus (physiology)|Stimuli]] that can trigger ASMR, as reported by those who experience it, include the following:\n* Listening to a softly spoken or whispering voice\n* Listening to quiet, repetitive sounds resulting from someone engaging in a mundane task such as turning the pages of a book\n* Watching somebody attentively execute a mundane task such as preparing food\n* Loudly chewing, crunching, slurping or biting foods, drinks, or gum\n* Receiving personal attention\n* Initiating the stimulus through conscious manipulation without the need for external video or audio triggers\n* Listening to tapping, typically nails onto surfaces such as plastic, wood, metal, etc.\n* Hand movements, especially onto one's face\n* Listening to certain types of music\n* Listening to a person blow or exhale into a microphone\n\nA 2017 study of 130 survey respondents found that lower-pitched, complex sounds, and slow-paced, detail-focused videos are especially effective triggers.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Barratt |first1=EL |last2=Spence |first2=C |last3=Davis |first3=NJ |title=Sensory determinants of the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR): understanding the triggers. |journal=PeerJ |date=2017 |volume=5 |pages=e3846 |doi=10.7717/peerj.3846 |pmid=29018601 |pmc=5633022}}</ref>\n\n===Whispering===\nPsychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barratt discovered that whispering was an effective trigger for 75% of the 475 subjects who took part in an experiment to investigate the nature of ASMR;<ref name=\"Barratt2015\"/> this statistic is reflected in the popularity of intentional ASMR videos that comprise someone speaking in a whispered voice.<ref name=\"Manduley2013\"/><ref name=\"ASMR videos - soothing or creepy?\"/><ref name=\"I have ASMR, do you?\"/>\n\n===Auditory===\nMany of those who experience ASMR report that non-vocal [[ambient noise]]s performed through human action are also effective triggers of ASMR. Examples of such noises include fingers scratching or tapping a surface, brushing hair, hands rubbing together or manipulating fabric, the crushing of eggshells, the crinkling and crumpling of a flexible material such as paper, or writing. Many [[YouTube]] videos that are intended to trigger ASMR responses feature a single person performing these actions and the sounds that result.<ref name=\"Why music gives you the chills\"/>\n\n===Personal attention role play===\nIn addition to the effectiveness of specific auditory stimuli, many subjects report that ASMR is triggered by the receipt of tender personal attention, often comprising combined physical touch and vocal expression, such as when having their hair cut, nails painted, [[mimikaki|ears cleaned]], or back massaged, whilst the service provider speaks quietly to the recipient.  \n\nFurthermore, many of those who have experienced ASMR during these and other comparable encounters with a service provider report that watching an \"ASMRtist\" simulate the provision of such personal attention, acting directly to the camera as if the viewer were the recipient of a simulated service, is sufficient to trigger it.<ref name=\"Ahuja2013\"/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.themarysue.com/what-the-hell-is-asmr/ |title=Brain Orgasms, Spidey Sense, and Bob Ross: A Look Inside The World Of ASMR |work=[[Dan Abrams|The Mary Sue]] |first=Carolyn |last=Cox |date=2 September 2014 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nPsychologists Nick Davis and Emma Barratt discovered that personal attention was an effective trigger for 69% of the 475 subjects who participated in a study conducted at [[Swansea University]], second in popularity only to whispering.<ref name=\"Barratt2015\"/>\n\n===Clinical role play===\nAmong the category of intentional ASMR videos that simulate the provision of personal attention is a subcategory wherein the \"ASMRtist\" is specifically depicted providing clinical or medical services, including routine general medical examinations.

Unintentional media is that made for other reasons, often before attention was drawn to the phenomenon in 2007, but which some subjects discover to be effective in triggering ASMR.

However, in binaural recordings, the two microphones tend to be more specially designed to mimic ears on humans. In many cases, microphones are separated the same distance as ears are on humans, and microphones are surrounded by ear-shaped cups to get similar reverb as human ears.\n\nViewing and hearing such ASMR videos that comprise ambient sound captured through [[binaural recording]] has been compared to the reported effect of listening to [[binaural beats]], which are also alleged to precipitate pleasurable sensations and the subjective experience of calm and equanimity.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://kotaku.com/5963533/this-drug-is-legal-its-digital-and-its-supposed-to-improve-how-you-game-i-put-it-to-the-test |title=This drug is legal. it's digital. and it's supposed to improve how you game.

When listening to sound through loudspeakers, the left and right ear can both hear the sound coming from both speakers. By distinction, when listening to sound through headphones, the sound from the left earpiece is audible only to the left ear, and the sound from the right ear piece is audible only to the right ear. When producing binaural media, the sound source is recorded by two separate microphones, placed at a distance comparable to that between two ears, and they are not mixed, but remain separate on the final medium, whether video or audio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.binaural.com/binfaq.html |title=Binaural for Beginners (FAQs) |website=Binaural.com |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nListening to a binaural recording through headphones simulates the [[binaural hearing]] by which people listen to live sounds. For the listener, this experience is characterized by two perceptions. Firstly, the listener perceives being in close proximity to the performers and location of the sound source. Secondly, the listener perceives what is often reported as a three-dimensional sound.<ref name=\"theverge.com\"/> This means the listener can perceive both the position and distance of the source of sound relative to them.\n\n==Scientific research and commentary==\n\n===Peer-reviewed articles===\nSeveral [[peer review|peer-reviewed]] articles about ASMR have been published.

Andersen's article proposes that the pleasure jointly shared by both an ASMR video creator and its viewers might be perceived as a particular form of 'non-standard intimacy' by which consumers pursue a form of pleasure mediated by video media. Andersen suggests that such pursuit is private yet also public or publicized through the sharing of experiences via online communication with others within the 'whispering community'.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Now You've Got the Shiveries |journal=Television & New Media |last=Andersen |first=Joceline |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=683\u2013700 |year=2014 |doi=10.1177/1527476414556184}}</ref>\n\nAnother article, \"Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR): a flow-like mental state\", by Nick Davis and Emma Barratt, lecturer and post-graduate researcher respectively in the Department of Psychology at [[Swansea University]], was published in [[PeerJ]].

The study found a significant difference in brain activation between time periods when the subject reported tingling (communicated by pressing a button), as compared to time periods when they were watching a video but not reporting tingling (communicated by pressing a different button, to control for brain activation effects caused by merely pressing a button). They concluded that \"the brain regions found most active during the tingling sensations were the [[nucleus accumbens]], [[prefrontal cortex|mPFC]], [[insular cortex|insula]] and [[secondary somatosensory cortex]]\", and suggested that these were similar to \"activation of brain regions previously observed during experiences like social bonding and musical [[frisson]]\".<ref name=\"BioImpacts 2018-09-23\">{{cite journal |title=An fMRI investigation of the neural correlates underlying the autonomous sensory meridian response (ASMR) |journal=Bioimpacts |first1=Bryson C. |last1=Lochte |first2=Sean A. |last2=Guillory |first3=Craig A.

On 12 March 2012, [[Steven Novella]], Director of General Neurology at the [[Yale School of Medicine]], published a post about ASMR on his blog ''Neurologica''. Regarding the question of whether ASMR is a real phenomenon, Novella said \"in this case, I don't think there is a definitive answer, but I am inclined to believe that it is. There are a number of people who seem to have independently experienced and described\" it with \"fairly specific details. In this way it's similar to migraine headaches \u2013 we know they exist as a syndrome primarily because many different people report the same constellation of symptoms and natural history.\" Novella tentatively posited the possibilities that ASMR might be either a type of pleasurable seizure or another way to activate the \"pleasure response\". However, Novella drew attention to the lack of scientific investigation into ASMR, suggesting that [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) and [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]] technologies should be used to study the brains of people who experience ASMR in comparison to people who do not, as a way of beginning to seek scientific understanding and explanation of the phenomenon.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://theness.com/neurologicablog/index.php/asmr/ |title=ASMR |work=Neurologica Blog |publisher=[[New England Skeptical Society]] |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skepticblog.org/2012/03/12/asmr/ |title=ASMR |website=Skepticblog.org |first=Steven |last=Novella |author-link=Steven Novella |date=12 March 2012 |accessdate=20 January 2016}}</ref>\n\nFour months after Novella's blog post, Tom Stafford, a lecturer in [[psychology]] and cognitive sciences at the [[University of Sheffield]], was reported to have said that ASMR \"might well be a real thing, but it's inherently difficult to research...something like this that you can't see or feel\" and \"doesn't happen for everyone\".

Because of this turmoil, there had been rumours that Lanegan had left the band, which [[Josh Homme]] eventually clarified in several interviews was never the case.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Nevertheless, he encouraged these rumours to draw the attention off the band by giving the press \"something to focus on while I was just making the record\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n{{cquote|And at the time, I was like, \"Fuck, no one's even listening to this.

The first pressing was released by [[AntAcidAudio]] and contains a different cover to the CD version. The sides are named ''Once'', ''You'', ''Were'' & ''Lost'', after a line from \"Someone's in the Wolf\", with each containing a mixture of the CD's album and bonus tracks (with the exception of ''Once'', only the standard tracks are present).\n\nThe second pressing is a reissue by Dutch record label Music On Vinyl, released on September 22, 2011. The reissue is different from the first pressing in that it does not have its sides named after the line from \"Someone's in the Wolf,\" and it uses the cover art from the CD release. The reissue omitted bonus tracks \"Infinity\" and \"Precious and Grace\" from the track listing, and listed \"Like a Drug\" as the last track. Side four contains an etching of one of the album's artwork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musiconvinyl.com/catalog.php/queens-of-the-stone-age/lullabies-to-paralyze|title=Music On Vinyl|first=Music

final item on the track list, \"[[The Fun Machine Took a Shit and Died]]\" (located behind the CD in the normal version, or inside the booklet in the deluxe edition), below \"Long Slow Goodbye\" reads; \"The Fun Machine took a shit and died \u2013 Was lost or misplaced. (There is a reward for the return of said tapes)\". During that time, the band assumed that the tapes of that song were either lost or stolen. A live version of this song can be found on the DVD release ''[[Over the Years and Through the Woods]]''. Homme commented, \"The tapes got lost. Actually, they were just at another studio, but we falsely accused everyone in the world of theft.\"<ref>[https://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/_/id/7600105/queensofthestoneage Josh Homme, 09/2005 interview] with [https://www.rollingstone.com RollingStone.com]</ref> The song was later rerecorded as a single and featured as a bonus track on ''Era Vulgaris.''\n\n==Personnel==\n===Queens of the Stone Age===\n* [[Josh Homme]] \u2013 lead vocals, guitar, bass, piano, drums, percussion, handclaps\n* [[Troy Van Leeuwen]] \u2013 guitar, bass, lap steel, piano, keyboards, handclaps, backing vocals\n* [[Joey Castillo]] \u2013 drums, piano, percussion, handclaps\n\n===Guest appearances===\n* [[Alain Johannes]] \u2013 guitar on tracks 5-7 and 11, bass on tracks 3, 4 and 9, flute & marxophone on track 9, backing vocals on 12, phone on 14\n* [[Mark Lanegan]] \u2013 lead vocals on \"This Lullaby\", co-lead vocals on \"Precious and Grace\" and backing vocals on \"Burn the Witch\" and \"You Got a Killer Scene There Man...\"\n* [[Chris Goss]] \u2013 backing vocals on \"You Got a Killer Scene There Man...\", \"Someone's in the Wolf\" and \"Burn the Witch\"\n* [[Billy Gibbons]] \u2013 guitar and backing vocals on \"Burn the Witch\", guitar and co-lead vocals \"Precious and Grace\", guitar on \"Like a Drug\"\n* [[Dave Catching]] \u2013 opening guitar on \"The Blood Is Love\"\n* [[Jack Black]] \u2013 handclaps and stomps on \"Burn the Witch\", and is also seen contributing the same for \"Broken Box\" during the bonus DVD\n* [[Jesse Hughes (musician)|Jesse Hughes]] \u2013 flute on \"Someone's in the Wolf\"\n* [[Shirley Manson]] \u2013 backing vocals on \"You Got a Killer Scene There, Man...\"\n* [[Brody Dalle]] \u2013 backing vocals on \"You Got a Killer Scene There Man...\"\n* [[Joe Barresi]] \u2013 triangle on \"Tangled Up in Plaid\"\n* The Main Street Horns \u2013 tubas and baritone trombone on \"I Never Came\", \"Someone's in the Wolf\" and \"Skin on Skin\"\n* [[Josh Freese]] - co-wrote \"In My Head\"\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Album===\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Because of this turmoil, there had been rumours that Lanegan had left the band, which [[Josh Homme]] eventually clarified in several interviews was never the case.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} Nevertheless, he encouraged these rumours to draw the attention off the band by giving the press \"something to focus on while I was just making the record\".{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}\n\n{{cquote|And at the time, I was like, \"Fuck, no one's even listening to this.

The first pressing was released by [[AntAcidAudio]] and contains a different cover to the CD version. The sides are named ''Once'', ''You'', ''Were'' & ''Lost'', after a line from \"Someone's in the Wolf\", with each containing a mixture of the CD's album and bonus tracks (with the exception of ''Once'', only the standard tracks are present).\n\nThe second pressing is a reissue by Dutch record label Music On Vinyl, released on September 22, 2011. The reissue is different from the first pressing in that it does not have its sides named after the line from \"Someone's in the Wolf,\" and it uses the cover art from the CD release. The reissue omitted bonus tracks \"Infinity\" and \"Precious and Grace\" from the track listing, and listed \"Like a Drug\" as the last track. Side four contains an etching of one of the album's artwork.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.musiconvinyl.com/catalog.php/queens-of-the-stone-age/lullabies-to-paralyze|title=Music On Vinyl|first=Music

Because of its amorphous character, it is classed as a [[mineraloid]], unlike crystalline forms of silica, which are classed as minerals.  It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of [[rock (geology)|rock]], being most commonly found with [[limonite]], [[sandstone]], [[rhyolite]], [[marl]], and [[basalt]]. \n\nThere are two broad classes of opal: precious and common. Precious opal displays play-of-color ([[iridescence]]), common opal does not.<ref>{{cite web |title=Opal Description |url=https://www.gia.edu/opal-description |website=Gemological Institute of America |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>  Play-of-color is defined as \"a pseudochromatic optical effect resulting in flashes of colored light from certain minerals, as they are turned in white light.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Glossary: Play of Color |url=https://www.mindat.org/glossary/play_of_color |website=Mindat |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>   The internal structure of precious opal causes it to [[diffraction|diffract]] light, resulting in play-of-color. Depending on the conditions in which it formed, opal may be transparent, translucent or opaque and the background color may be white, black or nearly any color of the visual spectrum. Black opal is considered to be the rarest, whereas white, gray and green are the most common.\n\n== Precious opal ==\n[[File:Opal molecular structure2.jpg|thumb|left|Precious opal consists of spheres of silicon dioxide molecules arranged in regular, closely packed planes.

At microscopic scales, precious opal is composed of silica spheres some 150 to 300&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] in diameter in a hexagonal or cubic [[close-packing|close-packed]] [[crystal structure|lattice]]. It was shown by J. V. Sanders in the mid-1960s<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.&nbsp;V.|date=1964|title=Colour of precious opal|journal=Nature|volume=204|issue=496|pages=1151\u20131153|doi=10.1038/2041151a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.&nbsp;V.|date=1968|title=Diffraction of light by opals|journal=Acta Crystallographica A|volume=24|issue=4|pages=427\u2013434|doi=10.1107/S0567739468000860|bibcode=1968AcCrA..24..427S}}</ref> that these ordered silica spheres produce the internal colors by causing the [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and [[diffraction]] of light passing through the microstructure of the opal.<ref name=Klein>{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Cornelis|last2=Hurlbut|first2=Cornelius S.|date=1985|title=Manual of Mineralogy|edition=20th|isbn=978-0-471-80580-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/manualofmineralo00klei}}</ref> The regularity of the sizes and the packing of these spheres determines the quality of precious opal. Where the distance between the regularly packed planes of spheres is around half the wavelength of a component of [[visible light]], the light of that wavelength may be subject to diffraction from the [[Diffraction grating|grating]] created by the stacked planes. The colors that are observed are determined by the spacing between the planes and the orientation of planes with respect to the incident light. The process can be described by [[Bragg's law]] of diffraction.\n\nVisible light cannot pass through large thicknesses of the opal. This is the basis of the optical [[band gap]] in a [[photonic crystal]]. The notion that opals are photonic crystals for visible light was expressed in 1995 by [[Vasily Astratov]]'s group.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Astratov |first=V.&nbsp;N.| year = 1995 | title = Optical spectroscopy of opal matrices with CdS embedded in its pores: Quantum confinement and photonic band gap effects | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento D | volume = 17 | issue = 11\u201312 | pages = 1349\u20131354 | last2 = Bogomolov | first2 = V.&nbsp;N. | last3 = Kaplyanskii | first3 = A.&nbsp;A. | last4 = Prokofiev | first4 = A.&nbsp;V. | last5 = Samoilovich | first5 = L.&nbsp;A. | last6 = Samoilovich | first6 = S.&nbsp;M. | last7 = Vlasov | first7 = Yu.&nbsp;A. | doi=10.1007/bf02457208|bibcode = 1995NCimD..17.1349A }}</ref> In addition, microfractures may be filled with secondary silica and form thin [[lamella (materials)|lamella]]e inside the opal during solidification. The term [[opalescence]] is commonly used to describe this unique and beautiful phenomenon, which in gemology is termed [[iridescence|play of color]]. In gemology, opalescence is applied to the hazy-milky-[[turbidity|turbid]] sheen of common or potch opal which does not show a play of color. [[Opalescence]] is a form of [[adularescence]].\n\nFor [[gemstone]] use, most opal is cut and polished to form a [[cabochon]]. \"Solid\" opal refers to polished stones consisting wholly of precious opal. Opals too thin to produce a \"solid\" may be combined with other materials to form attractive gems. An opal [[Doublet (lapidary)|doublet]] consists of a relatively thin layer of precious opal, backed by a layer of dark-colored material, most commonly ironstone, dark or black common opal (potch), onyx, or obsidian.  The darker backing emphasizes the play of color, and results in a more attractive display than a lighter potch. An opal triplet is similar to a doublet, but has a third layer, a domed cap of clear [[quartz]] or plastic on the top. The cap takes a high polish and acts as a protective layer for the opal. The top layer also acts as a magnifier, to emphasize the play of color of the opal beneath, which is often an inferior specimen or an extremely thin section of precious opal. Triplet opals tend to have a more artificial appearance, and are not classed as precious gemstones.  Jewelry applications of precious opal can be somewhat limited by opal's sensitivity to heat due primarily to its relatively high water content and predisposition to scratching.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Dr. Joel Arem |author2=Donald Clark, CSM IMG |url=http://www.gemsociety.org/article/opal-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |title=Opal Value, Price, and Jewelry |website=Gemsociety.org |date=2015-06-23 |accessdate=2016-11-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123060711/https://www.gemsociety.org/article/opal-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |archivedate=23 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nCombined with modern techniques of polishing, a doublet opal can produce a similar effect to solid black or boulder opal at a fraction of the price. Doublet opal also has the added benefit of having genuine opal as the top visible and touchable layer, unlike triplet opals.\n\n==Common opal==\n[[File:SLOVAKIAN OPAL 12.jpg|thumb|White and blue opal from Slovakia]]\nBesides the [[gemstone]] varieties that show a play of color, the other kinds of common opal include the milk opal, milky bluish to greenish (which can sometimes be of gemstone quality); [[resin]] opal, which is honey-yellow with a resinous luster; [[wood opal]], which is caused by the replacement of the organic material in wood with opal;<ref>{{cite book|last=Gribble|first=C.&nbsp;D.|title=Rutley's Elements of Mineralogy|publisher=Unwin Hyman|location=London|year=1988|edition=27th|page=431|chapter=Tektosilicates (framework silicates)|isbn=978-0-04-549011-0}}</ref> [[menilite]], which is brown or grey; [[hyalite]], a colorless glass-clear opal sometimes called Muller's glass; [[geyserite]], also called [[siliceous sinter]], deposited around [[hot springs]] or [[geyser]]s; and [[diatomaceous earth]], the accumulations of [[diatom]] shells or tests. Common opal often displays a hazy-milky-[[turbidity|turbid]] sheen from within the stone.

Although it does not usually show any play of color, occasionally a stone will exhibit bright green flashes. The most famous source of fire opals is the state of [[Quer\u00e9taro]] in Mexico; these opals are commonly called Mexican fire opals. Fire opals that do not show play of color are sometimes referred to as jelly opals. Mexican opals are sometimes cut in their rhyolitic host material if it is hard enough to allow cutting and polishing. This type of Mexican opal is referred to as a Cantera opal. Also, a type of opal from Mexico, referred to as Mexican water opal, is a colorless opal which exhibits either a bluish or golden internal sheen.<ref name=\"LetsTalk\">{{cite web|first1=James|last1=Swisher|first2=Edna B.|last2=Anthony|url=http://www.attawaygems.com/NMFG/Lets_talk_gemstones_opal.htm|title=Let's Talk Gemstones: Opal|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107214533/http://www.attawaygems.com/NMFG/Lets_talk_gemstones_opal.htm|archivedate=7 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGirasol opal is a term sometimes mistakenly and improperly used to refer to fire opals, as well as a type of transparent to semitransparent type milky quartz from Madagascar which displays an asterism, or star effect, when cut properly. However, the true girasol opal<ref name=\"LetsTalk\" /> is a type of [[hyalite]] opal that exhibits a bluish glow or sheen that follows the light source around. It is not a play of color as seen in precious opal, but rather an effect from microscopic inclusions. It is also sometimes referred to as water opal, too, when it is from Mexico. The two most notable locations of this type of opal are [[Oregon]] and Mexico.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nPeruvian opal (also called blue opal) is a semi-opaque to opaque blue-green stone found in Peru, which is often cut to include the matrix in the more opaque stones. It does not display play of color. Blue opal also comes from [[Oregon]] in the [[Owyhee River|Owyhee]] region, as well as from [[Nevada]] around the [[Virgin Valley]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOpal is also formed by [[diatom]]s.  Diatoms are a form of algae which, when they die, often form layers at the bottoms of lakes, bays, or oceans.  Their cell walls are made up of hydrated silicon dioxide which gives them structural coloration and therefore the appearance of tiny opals when viewed under a microscope.  These cell walls or \"tests\" form the \u201cgrains\u201d for the [[diatomaceous earth]].  This sedimentary rock is white, opaque, and chalky in texture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.minerals.net/mineral-variety/mineral/diatomite.aspx|title=diatomite - The Mineral and Gemstone Kingdom|website=www.minerals.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>  Diatomite has multiple industrial uses such as filtering or adsorbing since it has a fine particle size and very porous nature, and gardening to increase water adsorption.\n\n==History==\nOpal was rare and very valuable in antiquity.

In this region the opal deposits are located mainly in the mountain ranges of three municipalities: [[Col\u00f3n, Quer\u00e9taro|Col\u00f3n]], [[Tequisquiapan]] and [[Ezequiel Montes]]. During the 1960s through to the mid-1970s the Quer\u00e9taro mines were heavily mined. Today's opal miners report that it was much easier to find quality opals with a lot of fire and play of color back then, whereas today the gem quality opals are very hard to come by and command hundreds of US dollars or more.\n\nThe oldest mine in Quer\u00e9taro is Santa Maria del Iris. This mine was opened around 1870 and has been reopened at least 28 times since. At the moment there are about 100 mines in the regions around Quer\u00e9taro, but most of them are now closed. The best quality of opals came from the mine Santa Maria del Iris, followed by La Hacienda la Esperanza, Fuentezuelas, La Carbonera and La Trinidad. Important deposits in the state of [[Jalisco]] were not discovered until the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1957, Alfonso Ramirez (of Quer\u00e9taro) accidentally discovered the first opal mine in Jalisco - La Unica, located on the outer area of the volcano of Tequila, near the Huitzicilapan farm in Magdalena. By 1960 there were around 500 known opal mines in this region alone. Other regions of the country that also produce opals (of a lesser quality) are [[Guerrero]], which produces an opaque opal similar to the opals from Australia (some of these opals are carefully treated with heat to improve their colors so high-quality opals from this area may be suspect). There are also some small opal mines in [[Morelos]], [[Durango]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Baja California]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Puebla]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], and [[Estado de M\u00e9xico]].\n\n=== Other locations ===\n\nAnother source of white base opal or creamy opal in the United States is [[Spencer, Idaho]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eastidahonews.com/2015/08/future-of-spencer-opal-mining-uncertain/|title=If you've ever wanted an opal -- it's time to visit Spencer {{!}} East Idaho News|date=2015-08-06|work=East Idaho News|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}</ref> A high percentage of the opal found there occurs in thin layers.\n\nOther significant deposits of precious opal around the world can be found in the Czech Republic, Canada, Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil (in [[Pedro II, Piau\u00ed]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 |title=Boi Morto Mine, Pedro II, Piau\u00ed, Brazil |website=Mindat.org |accessdate=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512015022/http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 |archivedate=12 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), Honduras (more precisely in [[Erandique]]), Guatemala and Nicaragua.\n\nIn late 2008, [[NASA]] announced it had discovered opal deposits on [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|title=NASA probe finds opals in Martian crevices|accessdate=29 October 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119103930/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|archivedate=19 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Synthetic opal ==\nOpals of all varieties have been synthesized experimentally and commercially. The discovery of the ordered sphere structure of precious opal led to its synthesis by Pierre Gilson in 1974.<ref name=Klein /> The resulting material is distinguishable from natural opal by its regularity; under magnification, the patches of color are seen to be arranged in a \"lizard skin\" or \"chicken wire\" pattern. Furthermore, synthetic opals do not [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet]] light. Synthetics are also generally lower in density and are often highly porous.\n\nTwo notable producers of synthetic opal are [[Kyocera]] and [[Inamori]] of Japan. Most so-called synthetics, however, are more correctly termed \"imitation opal\", as they contain substances not found in natural opal (such as plastic stabilizers). The imitation opals seen in vintage jewelry are often foiled glass, glass-based \"[[Slocum stone]]\", or later plastic materials.\n\nOther research in macroporous structures have yielded highly ordered materials that have similar optical properties to opals and have been used in cosmetics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Highly-Ordered-Macroporous-Structures__99014.aspx |title=Macroporous Structures, Metal Oxides, Highly Ordered |website=Office for Technology Commercialization, Technology Marketing Site |publisher=University of Minnesota |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324152153/http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Highly-Ordered-Macroporous-Structures__99014.aspx |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Local atomic structure of opals ==\n[[File:Alphacrist.png|thumb|The crystal structure of crystalline \u03b1-[[cristobalite]]. Locally, the structures of some opals, opal-C, are similar to this.]]\n[[File:Lussatite-France.jpg|thumb|Lussatite (opal-CT)]]\nThe lattice of spheres of opal that cause the interference with light are several hundred times larger than the fundamental structure of crystalline silica. As a [[mineraloid]], no [[unit cell]] describes the structure of opal. Nevertheless, opals can be roughly divided into those that show no signs of crystalline order ([[amorphous]] opal) and those that show signs of the beginning of crystalline order, commonly termed [[cryptocrystalline]] or microcrystalline opal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graetsch|first=H.|title=Structural characteristics of opaline and microcrystalline silica minerals. Silica, physical behavior, geochemistry and materials applications|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy|volume=29|date=1994|editor1-first=P.&nbsp;J.|editor1-last=Heaney|editor2-first=Connecticut|editor2-last=Prewitt|editor3-first=G.&nbsp;V.|editor3-last=Gibbs}}</ref> Dehydration experiments and [[infrared spectroscopy]] have shown that most of the H<sub>2</sub>O in the formula of SiO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7''n''H<sub>2</sub>O of opals is present in the familiar form of clusters of molecular water. Isolated water molecules, and [[silanol]]s, structures such as SiOH, generally form a lesser proportion of the total and can reside near the surface or in defects inside the opal.\n\nThe structure of low-pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of anhydrous [[silica]] consist of frameworks of fully corner bonded tetrahedra of SiO<sub>4</sub>. The higher temperature polymorphs of silica [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] are frequently the first to crystallize from amorphous anhydrous silica, and the local structures of microcrystalline opals also appear to be closer to that of cristobalite and tridymite than to quartz. The structures of tridymite and cristobalite are closely related and can be described as [[hexagonal close packing|hexagonal]] and [[cubic close packing|cubic close-packed]] layers. It is therefore possible to have intermediate structures in which the layers are not regularly stacked.\n\n=== Microcrystalline opal ===\nOpal-CT has been interpreted as consisting of clusters of stacked [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] over very short length scales. The spheres of opal in opal-CT are themselves made up of tiny nanocrystalline blades of cristobalite and tridymite. Opal-CT has occasionally been further subdivided in the literature. Water content may be as high as 10&nbsp;wt%.<ref>[https://www.mindat.org/min-32185.html Opal-CT on Midat]</ref> Opal-C, also called ''lussatine'' or ''lussatite'', is interpreted as consisting of localized order of \u03b1-cristobalite with a lot of stacking disorder. Typical water content is about 1.5&nbsp;wt%.\n\n=== Noncrystalline opal ===\nTwo broad categories of noncrystalline opals, sometimes just referred to as \"opal-A\", have been proposed. The first of these is opal-AG consisting of aggregated spheres of silica, with water filling the space in between. Precious opal and potch opal are generally varieties of this, the difference being in the regularity of the sizes of the spheres and their packing. The second \"opal-A\" is opal-AN or water-containing amorphous silica-glass. [[Hyalite]] is another name for this.\n[[File:Schematic silica gel surface.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Schematic representation of the hydrated opal surface.]]\n\nNoncrystalline silica in siliceous sediments is reported to gradually transform to opal-CT and then opal-C as a result of [[diagenesis]], due to the increasing overburden pressure in [[sedimentary]] rocks, as some of the stacking disorder is removed.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf |title=HRTEM of microcrystalline opal in chert and porcelanite from the Monterey Formation, California |last=Cady |first=S.&nbsp;L. |last2=Wenk |first2=H.-R. |last3=Downing |first3=K.&nbsp;H. |date=1996 |journal=American Mineralogist |volume=81 |issue=11\u201312 |pages=1380\u20131395 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001053527/http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=1996AmMin..81.1380C |doi=10.2138/am-1996-11-1211 }}</ref>\n===Opal surface chemical groups===\n\nThe surface of opal in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH). This makes the opal surface very [[hydrophile|hydrophilic ]] and capable of forming numerous [[hydrogen bond]]s.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word 'opal' is adapted from the [[Latin]] term ''opalus'', but the origin of this word is a matter of debate. However, most modern references suggest it is adapted from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''\u00fapala''.<ref name=eckert>{{cite book|authorlink=Allan W. Eckert|first=Allan W.|last=Eckert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56|title=The World of Opals|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|date=1997|pages=56\u201357|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426210345/https://books.google.com/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56|archivedate=26 April 2016|df=dmy-all|isbn=9780471133971}}</ref>\n\nReferences to the gem are made by [[Pliny the Elder]]. It is suggested to have been adapted from [[Ops]], the wife of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] and goddess of fertility. The portion of [[Saturnalia]] devoted to Ops was \"Opalia\", similar to ''opalus''.\n\nAnother common claim that the term is adapted from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word, ''opallios''. This word has two meanings, one is related to \"seeing\" and forms the basis of the English words like \"opaque\"; the other is \"other\" as in \"alias\" and \"alter\". It is claimed that ''opalus'' combined these uses, meaning \"to see a change in color\". However, historians have noted the first appearances of ''opallios'' do not occur until after the Romans had taken over the Greek states in 180&nbsp;BC, and they had previously used the term ''paederos''.<ref name=eckert />\n\nHowever, the argument for the Sanskrit origin is strong. The term first appears in Roman references around 250&nbsp;BC, at a time when the opal was valued above all other gems. The opals were supplied by traders from the [[Bosporus]], who claimed the gems were being supplied from India. Before this the stone was referred to by a variety of names, but these fell from use after 250&nbsp;BC.\n\n== Historical superstitions ==\nIn the Middle Ages, opal was considered a stone that could provide great luck because it was believed to possess all the virtues of each gemstone whose color was represented in the color spectrum of the opal.<ref name=Fernie>{{cite book | last = Fernie | first = William Thomas | title = Precious Stones for Curative Wear | year = 1907 | location = Bristol | publisher = John Wright & Co | pages = [https://archive.org/details/b24855893/page/248 248]\u2013249 | url = https://archive.org/details/b24855893 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It was also said to grant invisibility if wrapped in a fresh [[bay leaf]] and held in the hand.<ref name=Fernie /><ref>{{cite book|title=Wicca Candle Magick|first=Gerina|last=Dunwich |author-link=Gerina Dunwich |year=1996|pages=84\u201385}}</ref> Following the publication of Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]'' in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation.

Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death.<ref name=Fernie /> Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Allan W.

Because of its amorphous character, it is classed as a [[mineraloid]], unlike crystalline forms of silica, which are classed as minerals.  It is deposited at a relatively low temperature and may occur in the fissures of almost any kind of [[rock (geology)|rock]], being most commonly found with [[limonite]], [[sandstone]], [[rhyolite]], [[marl]], and [[basalt]]. \n\nThere are two broad classes of opal: precious and common. Precious opal displays play-of-color ([[iridescence]]), common opal does not.<ref>{{cite web |title=Opal Description |url=https://www.gia.edu/opal-description |website=Gemological Institute of America |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>  Play-of-color is defined as \"a pseudochromatic optical effect resulting in flashes of colored light from certain minerals, as they are turned in white light.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Glossary: Play of Color |url=https://www.mindat.org/glossary/play_of_color |website=Mindat |accessdate=4 June 2018}}</ref>   The internal structure of precious opal causes it to [[diffraction|diffract]] light, resulting in play-of-color. Depending on the conditions in which it formed, opal may be transparent, translucent or opaque and the background color may be white, black or nearly any color of the visual spectrum. Black opal is considered to be the rarest, whereas white, gray and green are the most common.\n\n== Precious opal ==\n[[File:Opal molecular structure2.jpg|thumb|left|Precious opal consists of spheres of silicon dioxide molecules arranged in regular, closely packed planes. (Idealized diagram)]]\n[[File:Coober Pedy Opal 2.jpg|thumb|left|Multicolor rough crystal opal from Coober Pedy, South Australia, expressing nearly every color of the visible spectrum]]\n[[File:Opalised Ichthyosaur backbone.jpg|thumb|left|Precious opal replacing [[ichthyosaur]] backbone; display specimen, [[South Australian Museum]]]]\nPrecious opal shows a variable interplay of internal colors, and though it is a mineraloid, it has an internal structure. At microscopic scales, precious opal is composed of silica spheres some 150 to 300&nbsp;[[nanometre|nm]] in diameter in a hexagonal or cubic [[close-packing|close-packed]] [[crystal structure|lattice]]. It was shown by J. V. Sanders in the mid-1960s<ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.&nbsp;V.|date=1964|title=Colour of precious opal|journal=Nature|volume=204|issue=496|pages=1151\u20131153|doi=10.1038/2041151a0}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=J.&nbsp;V.|date=1968|title=Diffraction of light by opals|journal=Acta Crystallographica A|volume=24|issue=4|pages=427\u2013434|doi=10.1107/S0567739468000860|bibcode=1968AcCrA..24..427S}}</ref> that these ordered silica spheres produce the internal colors by causing the [[interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and [[diffraction]] of light passing through the microstructure of the opal.<ref name=Klein>{{cite book|last=Klein|first=Cornelis|last2=Hurlbut|first2=Cornelius S.|date=1985|title=Manual of Mineralogy|edition=20th|isbn=978-0-471-80580-9|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/manualofmineralo00klei}}</ref> The regularity of the sizes and the packing of these spheres determines the quality of precious opal. Where the distance between the regularly packed planes of spheres is around half the wavelength of a component of [[visible light]], the light of that wavelength may be subject to diffraction from the [[Diffraction grating|grating]] created by the stacked planes. The colors that are observed are determined by the spacing between the planes and the orientation of planes with respect to the incident light. The process can be described by [[Bragg's law]] of diffraction.\n\nVisible light cannot pass through large thicknesses of the opal. This is the basis of the optical [[band gap]] in a [[photonic crystal]]. The notion that opals are photonic crystals for visible light was expressed in 1995 by [[Vasily Astratov]]'s group.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Astratov |first=V.&nbsp;N.| year = 1995 | title = Optical spectroscopy of opal matrices with CdS embedded in its pores: Quantum confinement and photonic band gap effects | journal = Il Nuovo Cimento D | volume = 17 | issue = 11\u201312 | pages = 1349\u20131354 | last2 = Bogomolov | first2 = V.&nbsp;N. | last3 = Kaplyanskii | first3 = A.&nbsp;A. | last4 = Prokofiev | first4 = A.&nbsp;V. | last5 = Samoilovich | first5 = L.&nbsp;A. | last6 = Samoilovich | first6 = S.&nbsp;M. | last7 = Vlasov | first7 = Yu.&nbsp;A. | doi=10.1007/bf02457208|bibcode = 1995NCimD..17.1349A }}</ref> In addition, microfractures may be filled with secondary silica and form thin [[lamella (materials)|lamella]]e inside the opal during solidification. The term [[opalescence]] is commonly used to describe this unique and beautiful phenomenon, which in gemology is termed [[iridescence|play of color]]. In gemology, opalescence is applied to the hazy-milky-[[turbidity|turbid]] sheen of common or potch opal which does not show a play of color. [[Opalescence]] is a form of [[adularescence]].\n\nFor [[gemstone]] use, most opal is cut and polished to form a [[cabochon]]. \"Solid\" opal refers to polished stones consisting wholly of precious opal. Opals too thin to produce a \"solid\" may be combined with other materials to form attractive gems. An opal [[Doublet (lapidary)|doublet]] consists of a relatively thin layer of precious opal, backed by a layer of dark-colored material, most commonly ironstone, dark or black common opal (potch), onyx, or obsidian.  The darker backing emphasizes the play of color, and results in a more attractive display than a lighter potch. An opal triplet is similar to a doublet, but has a third layer, a domed cap of clear [[quartz]] or plastic on the top. The cap takes a high polish and acts as a protective layer for the opal. The top layer also acts as a magnifier, to emphasize the play of color of the opal beneath, which is often an inferior specimen or an extremely thin section of precious opal. Triplet opals tend to have a more artificial appearance, and are not classed as precious gemstones.  Jewelry applications of precious opal can be somewhat limited by opal's sensitivity to heat due primarily to its relatively high water content and predisposition to scratching.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Dr. Joel Arem |author2=Donald Clark, CSM IMG |url=http://www.gemsociety.org/article/opal-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |title=Opal Value, Price, and Jewelry |website=Gemsociety.org |date=2015-06-23 |accessdate=2016-11-22 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161123060711/https://www.gemsociety.org/article/opal-jewelry-and-gemstone-information/ |archivedate=23 November 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\nCombined with modern techniques of polishing, a doublet opal can produce a similar effect to solid black or boulder opal at a fraction of the price. Doublet opal also has the added benefit of having genuine opal as the top visible and touchable layer, unlike triplet opals.\n\n==Common opal==\n[[File:SLOVAKIAN OPAL 12.jpg|thumb|White and blue opal from Slovakia]]\nBesides the [[gemstone]] varieties that show a play of color, the other kinds of common opal include the milk opal, milky bluish to greenish (which can sometimes be of gemstone quality); [[resin]] opal, which is honey-yellow with a resinous luster; [[wood opal]], which is caused by the replacement of the organic material in wood with opal;<ref>{{cite book|last=Gribble|first=C.&nbsp;D.|title=Rutley's Elements of Mineralogy|publisher=Unwin Hyman|location=London|year=1988|edition=27th|page=431|chapter=Tektosilicates (framework silicates)|isbn=978-0-04-549011-0}}</ref> [[menilite]], which is brown or grey; [[hyalite]], a colorless glass-clear opal sometimes called Muller's glass; [[geyserite]], also called [[siliceous sinter]], deposited around [[hot springs]] or [[geyser]]s; and [[diatomaceous earth]], the accumulations of [[diatom]] shells or tests. Common opal often displays a hazy-milky-[[turbidity|turbid]] sheen from within the stone. In [[gemology]], this optical effect is strictly defined as [[opalescence]] which is a form of [[adularescence]].\n\n== Other varieties of opal ==\n{{redirect|Girasol|the American sunflower|Jerusalem artichoke}}\n[[File:10 7cts Brazilian Crystal Opal.jpg|thumb|Brightness of the fire in opal ranges on a scale of 1 to 5 (with 5 being the brightest)<ref>{{cite book|last=Downing|first=Paul B.|title=Opal Identification and Value|date=1992|pages=55\u201361}}</ref>]]\nFire opal is a transparent to translucent opal, with warm body colors of yellow to orange to red. Although it does not usually show any play of color, occasionally a stone will exhibit bright green flashes. The most famous source of fire opals is the state of [[Quer\u00e9taro]] in Mexico; these opals are commonly called Mexican fire opals. Fire opals that do not show play of color are sometimes referred to as jelly opals. Mexican opals are sometimes cut in their rhyolitic host material if it is hard enough to allow cutting and polishing. This type of Mexican opal is referred to as a Cantera opal. Also, a type of opal from Mexico, referred to as Mexican water opal, is a colorless opal which exhibits either a bluish or golden internal sheen.<ref name=\"LetsTalk\">{{cite web|first1=James|last1=Swisher|first2=Edna B.|last2=Anthony|url=http://www.attawaygems.com/NMFG/Lets_talk_gemstones_opal.htm|title=Let's Talk Gemstones: Opal|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107214533/http://www.attawaygems.com/NMFG/Lets_talk_gemstones_opal.htm|archivedate=7 November 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nGirasol opal is a term sometimes mistakenly and improperly used to refer to fire opals, as well as a type of transparent to semitransparent type milky quartz from Madagascar which displays an asterism, or star effect, when cut properly. However, the true girasol opal<ref name=\"LetsTalk\" /> is a type of [[hyalite]] opal that exhibits a bluish glow or sheen that follows the light source around. It is not a play of color as seen in precious opal, but rather an effect from microscopic inclusions. It is also sometimes referred to as water opal, too, when it is from Mexico. The two most notable locations of this type of opal are [[Oregon]] and Mexico.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nPeruvian opal (also called blue opal) is a semi-opaque to opaque blue-green stone found in Peru, which is often cut to include the matrix in the more opaque stones. It does not display play of color. Blue opal also comes from [[Oregon]] in the [[Owyhee River|Owyhee]] region, as well as from [[Nevada]] around the [[Virgin Valley]].{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}\n\nOpal is also formed by [[diatom]]s.  Diatoms are a form of algae which, when they die, often form layers at the bottoms of lakes, bays, or oceans.  Their cell walls are made up of hydrated silicon dioxide which gives them structural coloration and therefore the appearance of tiny opals when viewed under a microscope.  These cell walls or \"tests\" form the \u201cgrains\u201d for the [[diatomaceous earth]].  This sedimentary rock is white, opaque, and chalky in texture.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.minerals.net/mineral-variety/mineral/diatomite.aspx|title=diatomite - The Mineral and Gemstone Kingdom|website=www.minerals.net|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref>  Diatomite has multiple industrial uses such as filtering or adsorbing since it has a fine particle size and very porous nature, and gardening to increase water adsorption.\n\n==History==\nOpal was rare and very valuable in antiquity.

In this region the opal deposits are located mainly in the mountain ranges of three municipalities: [[Col\u00f3n, Quer\u00e9taro|Col\u00f3n]], [[Tequisquiapan]] and [[Ezequiel Montes]]. During the 1960s through to the mid-1970s the Quer\u00e9taro mines were heavily mined. Today's opal miners report that it was much easier to find quality opals with a lot of fire and play of color back then, whereas today the gem quality opals are very hard to come by and command hundreds of US dollars or more.\n\nThe oldest mine in Quer\u00e9taro is Santa Maria del Iris. This mine was opened around 1870 and has been reopened at least 28 times since. At the moment there are about 100 mines in the regions around Quer\u00e9taro, but most of them are now closed. The best quality of opals came from the mine Santa Maria del Iris, followed by La Hacienda la Esperanza, Fuentezuelas, La Carbonera and La Trinidad. Important deposits in the state of [[Jalisco]] were not discovered until the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1957, Alfonso Ramirez (of Quer\u00e9taro) accidentally discovered the first opal mine in Jalisco - La Unica, located on the outer area of the volcano of Tequila, near the Huitzicilapan farm in Magdalena. By 1960 there were around 500 known opal mines in this region alone. Other regions of the country that also produce opals (of a lesser quality) are [[Guerrero]], which produces an opaque opal similar to the opals from Australia (some of these opals are carefully treated with heat to improve their colors so high-quality opals from this area may be suspect). There are also some small opal mines in [[Morelos]], [[Durango]], [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Baja California]], [[Guanajuato]], [[Puebla]], [[Michoac\u00e1n]], and [[Estado de M\u00e9xico]].\n\n=== Other locations ===\n\nAnother source of white base opal or creamy opal in the United States is [[Spencer, Idaho]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.eastidahonews.com/2015/08/future-of-spencer-opal-mining-uncertain/|title=If you've ever wanted an opal -- it's time to visit Spencer {{!}} East Idaho News|date=2015-08-06|work=East Idaho News|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-US}}</ref> A high percentage of the opal found there occurs in thin layers.\n\nOther significant deposits of precious opal around the world can be found in the Czech Republic, Canada, Slovakia, Hungary, Turkey, Indonesia, Brazil (in [[Pedro II, Piau\u00ed]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 |title=Boi Morto Mine, Pedro II, Piau\u00ed, Brazil |website=Mindat.org |accessdate=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512015022/http://www.mindat.org/gallery.php?loc=8782 |archivedate=12 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>), Honduras (more precisely in [[Erandique]]), Guatemala and Nicaragua.\n\nIn late 2008, [[NASA]] announced it had discovered opal deposits on [[Mars]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|title=NASA probe finds opals in Martian crevices|accessdate=29 October 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090119103930/http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.cfm?release=2008-198|archivedate=19 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n== Synthetic opal ==\nOpals of all varieties have been synthesized experimentally and commercially. The discovery of the ordered sphere structure of precious opal led to its synthesis by Pierre Gilson in 1974.<ref name=Klein /> The resulting material is distinguishable from natural opal by its regularity; under magnification, the patches of color are seen to be arranged in a \"lizard skin\" or \"chicken wire\" pattern. Furthermore, synthetic opals do not [[fluorescence|fluoresce]] under [[ultraviolet]] light. Synthetics are also generally lower in density and are often highly porous.\n\nTwo notable producers of synthetic opal are [[Kyocera]] and [[Inamori]] of Japan. Most so-called synthetics, however, are more correctly termed \"imitation opal\", as they contain substances not found in natural opal (such as plastic stabilizers). The imitation opals seen in vintage jewelry are often foiled glass, glass-based \"[[Slocum stone]]\", or later plastic materials.\n\nOther research in macroporous structures have yielded highly ordered materials that have similar optical properties to opals and have been used in cosmetics.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Highly-Ordered-Macroporous-Structures__99014.aspx |title=Macroporous Structures, Metal Oxides, Highly Ordered |website=Office for Technology Commercialization, Technology Marketing Site |publisher=University of Minnesota |date=25 June 2010 |accessdate=8 October 2011 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324152153/http://www.license.umn.edu/Products/Highly-Ordered-Macroporous-Structures__99014.aspx |archivedate=24 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Local atomic structure of opals ==\n[[File:Alphacrist.png|thumb|The crystal structure of crystalline \u03b1-[[cristobalite]]. Locally, the structures of some opals, opal-C, are similar to this.]]\n[[File:Lussatite-France.jpg|thumb|Lussatite (opal-CT)]]\nThe lattice of spheres of opal that cause the interference with light are several hundred times larger than the fundamental structure of crystalline silica. As a [[mineraloid]], no [[unit cell]] describes the structure of opal. Nevertheless, opals can be roughly divided into those that show no signs of crystalline order ([[amorphous]] opal) and those that show signs of the beginning of crystalline order, commonly termed [[cryptocrystalline]] or microcrystalline opal.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graetsch|first=H.|title=Structural characteristics of opaline and microcrystalline silica minerals. Silica, physical behavior, geochemistry and materials applications|journal=Reviews in Mineralogy|volume=29|date=1994|editor1-first=P.&nbsp;J.|editor1-last=Heaney|editor2-first=Connecticut|editor2-last=Prewitt|editor3-first=G.&nbsp;V.|editor3-last=Gibbs}}</ref> Dehydration experiments and [[infrared spectroscopy]] have shown that most of the H<sub>2</sub>O in the formula of SiO<sub>2</sub>\u00b7''n''H<sub>2</sub>O of opals is present in the familiar form of clusters of molecular water. Isolated water molecules, and [[silanol]]s, structures such as SiOH, generally form a lesser proportion of the total and can reside near the surface or in defects inside the opal.\n\nThe structure of low-pressure [[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphs]] of anhydrous [[silica]] consist of frameworks of fully corner bonded tetrahedra of SiO<sub>4</sub>. The higher temperature polymorphs of silica [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] are frequently the first to crystallize from amorphous anhydrous silica, and the local structures of microcrystalline opals also appear to be closer to that of cristobalite and tridymite than to quartz. The structures of tridymite and cristobalite are closely related and can be described as [[hexagonal close packing|hexagonal]] and [[cubic close packing|cubic close-packed]] layers. It is therefore possible to have intermediate structures in which the layers are not regularly stacked.\n\n=== Microcrystalline opal ===\nOpal-CT has been interpreted as consisting of clusters of stacked [[cristobalite]] and [[tridymite]] over very short length scales. The spheres of opal in opal-CT are themselves made up of tiny nanocrystalline blades of cristobalite and tridymite. Opal-CT has occasionally been further subdivided in the literature. Water content may be as high as 10&nbsp;wt%.<ref>[https://www.mindat.org/min-32185.html Opal-CT on Midat]</ref> Opal-C, also called ''lussatine'' or ''lussatite'', is interpreted as consisting of localized order of \u03b1-cristobalite with a lot of stacking disorder. Typical water content is about 1.5&nbsp;wt%.\n\n=== Noncrystalline opal ===\nTwo broad categories of noncrystalline opals, sometimes just referred to as \"opal-A\", have been proposed. The first of these is opal-AG consisting of aggregated spheres of silica, with water filling the space in between. Precious opal and potch opal are generally varieties of this, the difference being in the regularity of the sizes of the spheres and their packing. The second \"opal-A\" is opal-AN or water-containing amorphous silica-glass. [[Hyalite]] is another name for this.\n[[File:Schematic silica gel surface.png|thumb|upright=1.75|Schematic representation of the hydrated opal surface.]]\n\nNoncrystalline silica in siliceous sediments is reported to gradually transform to opal-CT and then opal-C as a result of [[diagenesis]], due to the increasing overburden pressure in [[sedimentary]] rocks, as some of the stacking disorder is removed.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf |title=HRTEM of microcrystalline opal in chert and porcelanite from the Monterey Formation, California |last=Cady |first=S.&nbsp;L. |last2=Wenk |first2=H.-R. |last3=Downing |first3=K.&nbsp;H. |date=1996 |journal=American Mineralogist |volume=81 |issue=11\u201312 |pages=1380\u20131395 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001053527/http://minsocam.org/msa/AmMin/TOC/Articles_Free/1996/Cady_p1380-1395_96.pdf |archivedate=1 October 2011 |df=dmy-all |bibcode=1996AmMin..81.1380C |doi=10.2138/am-1996-11-1211 }}</ref>\n===Opal surface chemical groups===\n\nThe surface of opal in contact with water is covered by [[siloxane]] bonds (\u2261Si\u2013O\u2013Si\u2261) and [[silanol]] groups (\u2261Si\u2013OH). This makes the opal surface very [[hydrophile|hydrophilic ]] and capable of forming numerous [[hydrogen bond]]s.\n\n== Etymology ==\nThe word 'opal' is adapted from the [[Latin]] term ''opalus'', but the origin of this word is a matter of debate. However, most modern references suggest it is adapted from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''\u00fapala''.<ref name=eckert>{{cite book|authorlink=Allan W. Eckert|first=Allan W.|last=Eckert|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56|title=The World of Opals|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|date=1997|pages=56\u201357|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160426210345/https://books.google.com/books?id=vGewAkLkmvIC&pg=PA56|archivedate=26 April 2016|df=dmy-all|isbn=9780471133971}}</ref>\n\nReferences to the gem are made by [[Pliny the Elder]]. It is suggested to have been adapted from [[Ops]], the wife of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] and goddess of fertility. The portion of [[Saturnalia]] devoted to Ops was \"Opalia\", similar to ''opalus''.\n\nAnother common claim that the term is adapted from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] word, ''opallios''. This word has two meanings, one is related to \"seeing\" and forms the basis of the English words like \"opaque\"; the other is \"other\" as in \"alias\" and \"alter\". It is claimed that ''opalus'' combined these uses, meaning \"to see a change in color\". However, historians have noted the first appearances of ''opallios'' do not occur until after the Romans had taken over the Greek states in 180&nbsp;BC, and they had previously used the term ''paederos''.<ref name=eckert />\n\nHowever, the argument for the Sanskrit origin is strong. The term first appears in Roman references around 250&nbsp;BC, at a time when the opal was valued above all other gems. The opals were supplied by traders from the [[Bosporus]], who claimed the gems were being supplied from India. Before this the stone was referred to by a variety of names, but these fell from use after 250&nbsp;BC.\n\n== Historical superstitions ==\nIn the Middle Ages, opal was considered a stone that could provide great luck because it was believed to possess all the virtues of each gemstone whose color was represented in the color spectrum of the opal.<ref name=Fernie>{{cite book | last = Fernie | first = William Thomas | title = Precious Stones for Curative Wear | year = 1907 | location = Bristol | publisher = John Wright & Co | pages = [https://archive.org/details/b24855893/page/248 248]\u2013249 | url = https://archive.org/details/b24855893 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It was also said to grant invisibility if wrapped in a fresh [[bay leaf]] and held in the hand.<ref name=Fernie /><ref>{{cite book|title=Wicca Candle Magick|first=Gerina|last=Dunwich |author-link=Gerina Dunwich |year=1996|pages=84\u201385}}</ref> Following the publication of Sir [[Walter Scott]]'s ''[[Anne of Geierstein]]'' in 1829, opal acquired a less auspicious reputation. In Scott's novel, the Baroness of Arnheim wears an opal [[amulet|talisman]] with supernatural powers.

Due to the popularity of Scott's novel, people began to associate opals with bad luck and death.<ref name=Fernie /> Within a year of the publishing of Scott's novel in April 1829, the sale of opals in Europe dropped by 50%, and remained low for the next 20 years or so.<ref>{{cite book|authorlink=Allan W.

This pattern largely remained until the mid-twentieth century when a new division emerged between the [[Christian left]] (represented by the [[Social Gospel]] philosophy and [[ecumenicism]]) and the Christian right (represented by [[fundamentalism]] and [[biblical literalism]]). The Christian left (along with the secular and anti-religious left) became supporters of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] while the right moved to the [[Social Credit Party (Canada)|Social Credit Party]], especially in Western Canada, and to a lesser extent the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]].\n\nThe Social Credit Party, founded in 1935 represented a major change in Canadian religious politics. Until that time, fundamentalists had shunned politics as \"[[worldly]]\", and a distraction from the proper practice of religion. However, the new party was founded by fundamentalist radio preacher and Bible school teacher [[William Aberhart]] or \"Bible Bill\". Aberhart mixed his own interpretation of scripture and prophecy with the [[monetary reform]] theories of [[social credit]] to create a movement that swept across Alberta, winning the provincial election of 1935 in a landslide. Aberhart and his disciple [[Ernest Manning]] then governed the province for the next forty years, several times trying to expand into the rest of Canada. In 1987 Manning's son, [[Preston Manning]], founded the new [[Reform Party of Canada]], which soon became the main party of the religious right. It won majorities of the seats in Western Canada in repeated elections, but was unable to break through in Eastern Canada, though it became the [[official opposition]] from 1997 to 2003 (Reform was renamed the [[Canadian Alliance]] in 2000). In 2003 the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged to create the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], led by [[Stephen Harper]], a member of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]], who went on to become [[prime minister of Canada|prime minister]] in 2006.\n\nCanada has had a [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] since the [[Canadian Constitution]] was patriated in 1982. As a result, there have been major changes in the law's application to issues that bear on individual and minority group rights. Abortions were completely decriminalized after two R. v. Morgentaler cases ([[R. v. Morgentaler|in 1988]] and [[R. v. Morgentaler (1993)|in 1993]]).

Except for left-wing and far-left parties with strong social progressive beliefs like [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] or [[Socialism and Liberty Party]], Christian conservatives can be found in all political parties of Brazil, but nevertheless they are more common associated with parties like [[Social Democratic Party (Brazil, 2011)|Social Democratic Party]], [[Democratas]], [[Social Liberal Party (Brazil)|PSL]], [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)|Social Christian Party]], [[Brazilian Republican Party]], [[Patriota]] and in the [[Party of the Republic]].

This pattern largely remained until the mid-twentieth century when a new division emerged between the [[Christian left]] (represented by the [[Social Gospel]] philosophy and [[ecumenicism]]) and the Christian right (represented by [[fundamentalism]] and [[biblical literalism]]). The Christian left (along with the secular and anti-religious left) became supporters of the [[New Democratic Party (Canada)|New Democratic Party]] while the right moved to the [[Social Credit Party (Canada)|Social Credit Party]], especially in Western Canada, and to a lesser extent the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservatives]].\n\nThe Social Credit Party, founded in 1935 represented a major change in Canadian religious politics. Until that time, fundamentalists had shunned politics as \"[[worldly]]\", and a distraction from the proper practice of religion. However, the new party was founded by fundamentalist radio preacher and Bible school teacher [[William Aberhart]] or \"Bible Bill\". Aberhart mixed his own interpretation of scripture and prophecy with the [[monetary reform]] theories of [[social credit]] to create a movement that swept across Alberta, winning the provincial election of 1935 in a landslide. Aberhart and his disciple [[Ernest Manning]] then governed the province for the next forty years, several times trying to expand into the rest of Canada. In 1987 Manning's son, [[Preston Manning]], founded the new [[Reform Party of Canada]], which soon became the main party of the religious right. It won majorities of the seats in Western Canada in repeated elections, but was unable to break through in Eastern Canada, though it became the [[official opposition]] from 1997 to 2003 (Reform was renamed the [[Canadian Alliance]] in 2000). In 2003 the Canadian Alliance and the Progressive Conservatives merged to create the [[Conservative Party of Canada]], led by [[Stephen Harper]], a member of the [[Christian and Missionary Alliance]], who went on to become [[prime minister of Canada|prime minister]] in 2006.\n\nCanada has had a [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] since the [[Canadian Constitution]] was patriated in 1982. As a result, there have been major changes in the law's application to issues that bear on individual and minority group rights. Abortions were completely decriminalized after two R. v.

Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\n\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what's up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept [[Crash (computing)|crashing]], Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job.

Although Acton was working on another startup idea, he decided to join the company.<ref name=\"History\" /> In October 2009, Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in [[seed funding]], and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake.

Koum then hired a friend in [[Los Angeles]], Chris Peiffer, to develop a [[BlackBerry]] version, which arrived two months later.<ref name=\"History\" />\n\nTo cover the primary cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one. In December 2009, the ability to send photos was added to the iPhone version.

The engagement was fought in the [[Adriatic Sea]] for possession of the strategically important Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (''Lissa'' in Italian), from which the British squadron had been disrupting French shipping in the Adriatic. The French needed to control the Adriatic to supply a growing army in the [[Illyrian Provinces]], and consequently dispatched an invasion force in March 1811 consisting of six frigates, numerous smaller craft and a battalion of Italian soldiers.\n\nThe French invasion force under [[Bernard Dubourdieu]] was met by Captain [[William Hoste]] and his four ships based on the island. In the subsequent battle, Hoste sank the French flagship, captured two others, and scattered the remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron. The battle has been hailed as an important British victory, due to both the disparity between the forces and the signal raised by Hoste, a former subordinate of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]]. Hoste had raised the message \"Remember Nelson\" as the French bore down, and had then manoeuvred to drive Dubourdieu's flagship ashore and scatter his squadron in what has been described as \"one of the most brilliant naval achievements of the war\".<ref name=\"ODNBHoste\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13844 Hoste, Sir William], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[J. K. Laughton]], Retrieved 22 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814}}\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]], the name for a succession of connected conflicts between the armies of the French Emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and his European opponents, were nine years old when the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] ended in 1809. The [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] that followed the war gave Napoleon possession of the final part of Adriatic coastline not under his control: the [[Illyrian Provinces]]. This formalised the control the French had exercised in Illyria since 1805 and over the whole [[Adriatic Sea]] since the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807.<ref name=\"DC441\"/> In the Treaty of Tilsit, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] had granted France control over the [[Septinsular Republic]] and withdrawn their own forces from the region, allowing Napoleon freedom of action in the Adriatic.<ref name=\"RG153\">Gardiner, p. 153</ref> At Sch\u00f6nbrunn, Napoleon made the Illyrian Provinces part of metropolitan [[France]] and therefore under direct French rule, unlike the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] which was nominally independent but in reality came under his personal rule.<ref name=\"JH111\"/> Thus, the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn formalised Napoleon's control of almost the entire coastline of the Adriatic and, if unopposed, would allow him to transport troops and supplies to the [[Balkans]]. The French army forming in the Illyrian Provinces was possibly intended for an invasion of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in conjunction with the Russians;<ref name=\"JH111\">Henderson, p. 111</ref> the two countries had signed an agreement to support one another against the Ottomans at Tilsit.<ref name=\"DC441\">Chandler p. 441</ref>\n\nTo disrupt the preparations of this army, the British [[Royal Navy]], which had controlled most of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] since the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805, seized the Dalmatian Island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]] in 1807 and used it as a base for raiding the coastal shipping of Italy and Illyria. These operations captured dozens of ships and caused panic and disruption to French strategy in the region.<ref name=\"RG154\">Gardiner, p. 154</ref> To counter this, the French government started a major shipbuilding programme in the Italian seaports, particularly [[Venice]], and despatched frigates of their own to protect their shipping. Commodore [[Bernard Dubourdieu]]'s Franco-Venetian forces were unable to bring the smaller British force under [[William Hoste]] to a concerted action, where Dubourdieu's superior numbers might prove decisive. Instead, the British and French frigate squadrons engaged in a campaign of raids and counter-raids during 1810.<ref name=\"JH112\">Henderson, p. 112</ref>\n[[File:001 Dubourdieu.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Captain [[Bernard Dubourdieu]]]]\n[[File:William-hoste-1-sized.jpg|thumb|150px|Captain William Hoste]]\n\nIn October 1810, Dubourdieu landed 700 Italian soldiers on Lissa while Hoste searched in vain for the French squadron in the Southern Adriatic.<ref name=\"RW253\">Woodman, p. 253</ref> The island had been left in the command of two [[midshipmen]], James Lew and Robert Kingston, who withdrew the entire population of the island into the central mountains along with their supplies.<ref name = \"JH119\"/> The Italian troops were left in possession of the deserted main town, [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]].<ref name=\"WJ256\">James, p. 256</ref> The French and Italians burnt several vessels in the harbour and captured others, but remained on the island for no more than seven hours, retreating before Hoste returned.<ref name=\"RG172\">Gardiner, p. 172</ref> The remainder of the year was quiet, the British squadron gaining superiority after being reinforced by the [[third-rate]] [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Montagu (1779)|HMS ''Montagu'']].<ref name=\"WLC472\">Clowes, p. 472</ref>\n\nEarly in 1811 the raiding campaigns began again, and British attacks along the Italian coast prompted Dubourdieu to mount a second invasion of Lissa. Taking advantage of the temporary absence of ''Montagu'', Dubourdieu assembled six frigates and numerous smaller craft and embarked over 500 Italian soldiers under Colonel Alexander Gifflenga.<ref>Sources differ on the spelling of Gifflenga's first name, using Alexander and Alexandre interchangeably.</ref> The squadron amassed by Dubourdieu not only outnumbered the British in terms of men and ships, it was also twice as heavy in weight of shot.<ref name=\"WJ360\">James, p. 360</ref> Dubourdieu planned to overwhelm Hoste's frigate squadron and then invade and capture the island, which would eradicate the British threat in the Adriatic for months to come.<ref name=\"JH113\"/>\n\n==Battle==\nDubourdieu (as [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]]) led a squadron consisting of six [[frigate]]s (four of 40 guns and two of 32 guns), a 16-gun [[brig]], two [[schooner]]s, one [[xebec]], and two [[gunboat]]s. Three of his ships were from the [[French Navy]], and the others from the Navy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. In addition the squadron carried 500 Italian soldiers. In the absence of ''Montagu'', Hoste's squadron consisted of three frigates (one of 38 guns and two of 32 guns) and one 22-gun [[post ship]]. The island of Lissa itself was defended by a small number of local troops under the command of two [[midshipmen]].\n\nDubourdieu's squadron was spotted approaching the island of Lissa at 03:00 on 12 March 1811 by Captain Gordon in [[HMS Active (1799)|HMS ''Active'']], which had led the British squadron from [[Vis (town)|Port St George]] on a cruise off Ancona.<ref name=\"RLA358\">Adkins, p. 358</ref> Turning west, the British squadron awaited the French approach in line ahead, sailing along the north coast of the island within half a mile of the shoreline. By 06:00, Dubourdieu was approaching the British line from the north-east in two divisions, leading in [[French frigate Favorite (1810)|''Favorite'']] at the head of the windward or western division. Dubourdieu hoped to pass ahead of ''Active'' at the head of the British line and cross it further east with [[French frigate Dana\u00e9 (1807)|''Dana\u00e9'']], which led the leeward division. Dubourdieu intended to break the British line in two places and destroy the British squadron in the crossfire.<ref name=\"RG173\">Gardiner, p. 173</ref>\n[[File:Battle of Lissa 1811 Map.png|thumb|300px|The opening stages of the battle]]\n\nOver the next three hours the squadrons continued to close, light winds restricting them to a little over three [[Knot (unit)|knots]].<ref name=\"WJ352\"/> A protege of Nelson, Hoste recalled the inspirational effect of [[England expects that every man will do his duty|Nelson's signal]] before the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and raised his own: \"Remember Nelson\", which was greeted with wild cheering from the squadron.<ref name=\"JH113\">Henderson, p. 113</ref> As he closed with Hoste's force, Dubourdieu realised that he would be unable to successfully cross ''Active's'' bow due to the British ship's speed, and would also be unable to break through their line due to the British ships' close proximity to one another.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> He instead sought to attack the second ship in the British line, Hoste's flagship [[HMS Amphion (1799)|HMS ''Amphion'']]. Dubourdieu possessed not only a significant advantage in ships but also in men, the Italian soldiers aboard giving him the opportunity to overwhelm the British crews if he could board their frigates successfully.<ref name=\"JH113\"/> The first shots of the battle were fired at 09:00, as the British used their wider field of fire to attack the leading French ships, ''Favorite'' and ''Dana\u00e9'', unopposed for several minutes. The French squadron held their fire, Dubourdieu gathering his troops and sailors into ''Favorite'''s bow in order to maximise the effect of his initial attack once his flagship came into contact with ''Amphion''.<ref name=\"WJ352\"/>\n\nHoste was aware of Dubourdieu's intentions and the French advantage in numbers, and consequently ordered a large {{convert|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[howitzer]] on ''Amphion's'' deck [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail#Shot|triple-shotted]] until the cannon contained over 750&nbsp;[[Musket#Ammunition|musket balls]]<ref name=\"RLA360\">Adkins, p. 360</ref> Once ''Favorite'' was within a few yards of ''Amphion'''s stern, Hoste gave permission for the gun to be fired and the cannon's discharge instantly swept the bow of ''Favorite'' clear of the French and Italian boarding party.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> Among the dozens killed and wounded were Dubourdieu and all the frigate's officers, leaving Colonel Gifflenga in command of ''Favorite''.<ref name=\"JH115\">Henderson, p. 115</ref> As ''Favorite'' and ''Amphion'' closed with one another, firing continued between the British rear and the French leeward division, led by ''Dana\u00e9''. Several of the French ships came at an angle at which they could bring their guns to bear on [[HMS Cerberus (1794)|HMS ''Cerberus'']], the rearmost British ship, and both sides were firing regular broadsides at one another.<ref name=\"WJ352\">James p. 352</ref>\n\n===Hoste's manoeuvre===\nFollowing the death of Dubourdieu, Captain P\u00e9ridier on [[French frigate Flore (1806)|''Flore'']] ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The battered ''Favorite'' led with an attempt to round ''Amphion'' and [[Raking fire|rake]] her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention.<ref name=\"WJ353\">James p. 353</ref> The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers to bear on the British squadron. Hoste was prepared for this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to [[Jibe|wear]], turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised.<ref name=\"JH115\"/> ''Favorite'', which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.<ref name=\"BI194\">Ireland p. 194</ref>\n\nThrown into further confusion by the loss of ''Favorite'', the French and Venetian formation began to break up and the British squadron was able to pull ahead of their opponents; the leading French ships ''Flore'' and ''Bellona'' succeeded in only reaching ''Amphion'', which was now at the rear of the British line.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> ''Amphion'' found herself caught between the two frigates and this slowed the British line enough that the French eastern division, led by ''Dana\u00e9'', was able to strike at [[HMS Volage (1807)|HMS ''Volage'']], now the leading British ship after overtaking ''Cerberus'' during the turn.<ref name=\"JH116\"/> ''Volage'' was much smaller than her opponent but was armed with 32-pounder [[carronade]]s, short range guns that caused such damage to ''Dana\u00e9'' that the French ship was forced to haul off and reengage from a longer range. The strain of combat at this greater distance ruptured ''Volage's'' short-ranged carronades and left the ship much weakened, with only a single gun with which to engage the enemy.<ref name=\"WJ354\">James p. 354</ref>\n\n===Chase===\n[[File:Battle of Lissa.jpg|300px|thumb|''Battle of Lissa, 13 March 1811''<br />Engraved by [[Henri Merke]] after a painting by [[George Webster (painter)|George Webster]], 1812]]\nBehind ''Volage'' and ''Dana\u00e9'', the Venetian ''Corona'' had engaged ''Cerberus'' in a close range duel, during which ''Cerberus'' took heavy damage but inflicted similar injuries on the Italian ship. This exchange continued until the arrival of ''Active'' caused the ''Dana\u00e9'', ''Corona'' and ''Carolina'' to sheer off and retreat to the east.<ref name=\"WJ355\">James p. 355</ref> To the rear, ''Amphion'' succeeded in closing with and raking ''Flore'', and caused such damage that within five minutes the French ship's officers threw the [[French tricolour|French colours]] overboard in surrender. Captain P\u00e9ridier had been seriously wounded in the action, and took no part in ''Flore'''s later movements. ''Amphion'' then attacked ''Bellona'' and in an engagement that lasted until 12:00, forced the Italian ship's surrender.<ref name=\"RW255\">Woodman p. 255</ref> During this combat, the small ship ''Principessa Augusta'' fired on ''Amphion'' from a distance, until the frigate was able to turn a gun on them and drive them off.<ref name=\"RG174\">Gardiner, p. 174</ref> Hoste sent a [[punt (boat)|punt]] to take possession of ''Bellona'' but due to the damage suffered was unable to launch a boat to seize ''Flore''. Realising ''Amphion's'' difficulty, the officers of ''Flore'', who had made hasty repairs during the conflict between ''Amphion'' and ''Bellona'', immediately set sail for the French harbour on [[Hvar|Lesina]] (Hvar), despite having already surrendered.<ref name=\"JH116\">Henderson, p. 116</ref><ref name=\"RG174\"/>\n\n''Active'', the only British ship still in fighting condition, took up pursuit of the retreating enemy and at 12:30 caught the ''Corona'' in the channel between Lissa and the small island of Spalmadon.<ref name=\"JH117\">Henderson, p. 117</ref> The frigates manoeuvred around one another for the next hour; captains Gordon and Pasqualigo each seeking the best position from which to engage. The frigates engaged in combat at 13.45, ''Active'' forcing ''Corona'''s surrender 45&nbsp;minutes later after a fire broke out aboard the Italian ship.<ref name=\"RLA361\">Adkins, p. 361</ref> ''Active'' too had suffered severely and as the British squadron was not strong enough to continue the action by attacking the remaining squadron in its protected harbour on Lesina, the battle came to an end.<ref name=\"JH119\"/> The survivors of the Franco-Venetian squadron had all reached safety; ''Carolina'' and ''Dana\u00e9'' had used the conflict between ''Active'' and ''Corona'' to cover their escape while ''Flore'' had indicated to each British ship she passed that she had surrendered and was in British possession despite the absence of a British officer on board. Once ''Flore'' was clear of the British squadron she headed for safety, reaching the batteries of Lesina shortly after her ''Carolina'' and ''Dana\u00e9'' and ahead of the limping British pursuit. The smaller craft of the Franco-Venetian squadron scattered during the battle's final stages and reached Lesina independently.<ref name=\"JH119\"/>\n\n===Conclusion===\n[[File:BattleofLissa1811(2).jpg|300px|thumb|The latter stages of the battle. The burning '' [[French frigate Favorite (1810)|Favorite]]'' can be seen in the background.<br />Engraving by Henri Merke after a painting by George Webster, 1812]]\nAlthough ''Favorite'' was wrecked, over 200 of her crew and soldier-passengers had reached the land and, having set fire to their ship, prepared to march on Port St. George under the leadership of Colonel Gifflenga. Two British midshipmen left in command of the town organised the British and indigenous population into a defensive force and marched to meet Gifflenga. The junior British officers informed Gifflenga that the return of the British squadron would bring overwhelming numbers of sailors, marines and naval artillery to bear on his small force and that if he surrendered immediately he could expect better terms. Gifflenga recognised that his position was untenable and capitulated.<ref name=\"RG174\"/><ref name=\"WJ361\">James, p. 361</ref> At Port St. George, the Venetian gunboat ''Lodola'' sneaked unnoticed into the harbour and almost captured a Sicilian privateer, ''Vincitore''. The raider was driven off by the remaining garrison of the town without the prize, while attempting to manoeuvre her out of the bay.<ref name=\"RW256\">Woodman p. 256</ref>\n\nIn the seas off Lissa, British prize crews were making strenuous efforts to protect their captures; ''Corona'' was heavily on fire in consequence of her engagement with ''Active'' and the British prize crew fought the blaze alongside their Italian prisoners. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when the blazing mainmast collapsed.<ref name=\"WJ358\"/> Problems were also experienced aboard ''Bellona'', where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command to light the fuse. The officer promised to do so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British prize crew when they arrived. Duodo died still believing that the fuse had been lit.<ref name=\"WJ358\">James, p. 358</ref>\n\nHoste also remained at sea, cruising in the battered ''Amphion'' beyond the range of the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of ''Flore's'' officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender.<ref name=\"WJ361\"/> In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of ''Flore'' had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which a ship that voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of life among its crew. ''Flore'' had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron only because she was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act.<ref name=\"JH119\"/><ref name=\"WJ361\"/> The French at Lesina did not respond to Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.\n\n==Aftermath==\nCasualties of the action were heavy on both sides. The British ships suffered 190 killed or wounded in the battle and a number lost afterwards in the fire aboard ''Corona''. Captains Hoste and Hornby were both badly wounded and the entire British squadron was in need of urgent repair before resuming the campaign.<ref name=\"WJ357\"/> In the French and Italian squadron the situation was even worse, although precise losses are not known. At least 150 had been killed aboard ''Favorite'' either in the action or the wreck, and the 200 survivors of her crew and passengers were all made prisoner. ''Bellona'' had suffered at least 70 casualties and ''Corona's'' losses were also severe.<ref name=\"WJ357\">James, p. 357</ref> Among the ships that escaped less is known of their casualties, but all required repair and reinforcement before the campaign could resume. Total French and Italian losses are estimated at no less than 700.<ref name=\"RG174\"/> Losses among the officers of the combined squadron were especially high, with Commodore Dubourdieu and captains Meillerie and Duodo killed and P\u00e9ridier seriously wounded.\n\nThe immediate aftermath saw renewed efforts by Hoste to induce the French to hand over ''Flore'', efforts that were rebuffed by the captain of the ''Dana\u00e9'', who had assumed command of the French squadron.<ref name=\"WJ361\"/> The surviving French and Venetian ships were initially laid up in [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] (Dubrovnik) awaiting supplies to continue the campaign, but a separate British squadron discovered and sank the supply ship at [[Pore\u010d|Parenzo]] (Pore\u010d), necessitating a full French withdrawal from the area.<ref name=\"RG174\"/> In Britain, Hoste's action was widely praised; the squadron's first lieutenants were all promoted to commander and the captains all presented with a commemorative medal.<ref name=\"BI194\"/><ref name=\"JH120\">Henderson, p. 120</ref> Nearly four decades later the battle was also recognized in the issue of the clasp ''Lissa'' to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=20939|pages=236\u2013245|date=26 January 1849}}</ref> On their arrival in Britain, ''Corona'' and ''Bellone'' were repaired and later purchased for service in the Royal Navy, the newly built ''Corona'' being named {{HMS|Daedalus|1811|6}} and ''Bellone'' becoming the [[troopship]] {{HMS|Dover|1811|6}}.<ref name=\"JH119\">Henderson, p. 119</ref> ''Daedalus'' was commissioned in 1812 under Captain [[Murray Maxwell]], but served less than a year; wrecked off [[Ceylon]] in July 1813.<ref name=\"TG357\">Grocott, p. 357</ref>\n\nBritish numerical superiority in the region was assured; when French reinforcements for the Adriatic departed [[Toulon]] on 25 March they were hunted down and driven back to France by Captain [[Robert Otway]] in {{HMS|Ajax|1809|6}} before they had even passed [[Corsica]].<ref name=\"WJ362\">James p. 362</ref> Throughout the remainder of 1811 however, British and French frigate squadrons continued to spar across the Adriatic, the most significant engagement being the [[action of 29 November 1811]], in which a second French squadron was destroyed.<ref name=\"RG178\">Gardiner, p. 178</ref> The action had significant long-term effects; the destruction of one of the best-trained and best-led squadrons in the French Navy and the death of the aggressive Dubourdieu ended the French ability to strike into the Balkans against the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"RLA363\">Adkins, p. 363</ref>\n\n==Order of battle==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Captain Hoste's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n!

The engagement was fought in the [[Adriatic Sea]] for possession of the strategically important Croatian island of [[Vis (island)|Vis]] (''Lissa'' in Italian), from which the British squadron had been disrupting French shipping in the Adriatic. The French needed to control the Adriatic to supply a growing army in the [[Illyrian Provinces]], and consequently dispatched an invasion force in March 1811 consisting of six frigates, numerous smaller craft and a battalion of Italian soldiers.\n\nThe French invasion force under [[Bernard Dubourdieu]] was met by Captain [[William Hoste]] and his four ships based on the island. In the subsequent battle, Hoste sank the French flagship, captured two others, and scattered the remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron. The battle has been hailed as an important British victory, due to both the disparity between the forces and the signal raised by Hoste, a former subordinate of [[Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson|Horatio Nelson]]. Hoste had raised the message \"Remember Nelson\" as the French bore down, and had then manoeuvred to drive Dubourdieu's flagship ashore and scatter his squadron in what has been described as \"one of the most brilliant naval achievements of the war\".<ref name=\"ODNBHoste\">[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/13844 Hoste, Sir William], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[J.

Laughton]], Retrieved 22 May 2008</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{details|Adriatic campaign of 1807\u20131814}}\nThe [[Napoleonic Wars]], the name for a succession of connected conflicts between the armies of the French Emperor [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] and his European opponents, were nine years old when the [[War of the Fifth Coalition]] ended in 1809. The [[Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn]] that followed the war gave Napoleon possession of the final part of Adriatic coastline not under his control: the [[Illyrian Provinces]]. This formalised the control the French had exercised in Illyria since 1805 and over the whole [[Adriatic Sea]] since the [[Treaty of Tilsit]] in 1807.<ref name=\"DC441\"/> In the Treaty of Tilsit, [[Russian Empire|Russia]] had granted France control over the [[Septinsular Republic]] and withdrawn their own forces from the region, allowing Napoleon freedom of action in the Adriatic.<ref name=\"RG153\">Gardiner, p. 153</ref> At Sch\u00f6nbrunn, Napoleon made the Illyrian Provinces part of metropolitan [[France]] and therefore under direct French rule, unlike the neighbouring [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]] which was nominally independent but in reality came under his personal rule.<ref name=\"JH111\"/> Thus, the Treaty of Sch\u00f6nbrunn formalised Napoleon's control of almost the entire coastline of the Adriatic and, if unopposed, would allow him to transport troops and supplies to the [[Balkans]]. The French army forming in the Illyrian Provinces was possibly intended for an invasion of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in conjunction with the Russians;<ref name=\"JH111\">Henderson, p. 111</ref> the two countries had signed an agreement to support one another against the Ottomans at Tilsit.<ref name=\"DC441\">Chandler p. 441</ref>\n\nTo disrupt the preparations of this army, the British [[Royal Navy]], which had controlled most of the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] since the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805, seized the Dalmatian Island of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]] in 1807 and used it as a base for raiding the coastal shipping of Italy and Illyria. These operations captured dozens of ships and caused panic and disruption to French strategy in the region.<ref name=\"RG154\">Gardiner, p. 154</ref> To counter this, the French government started a major shipbuilding programme in the Italian seaports, particularly [[Venice]], and despatched frigates of their own to protect their shipping. Commodore [[Bernard Dubourdieu]]'s Franco-Venetian forces were unable to bring the smaller British force under [[William Hoste]] to a concerted action, where Dubourdieu's superior numbers might prove decisive. Instead, the British and French frigate squadrons engaged in a campaign of raids and counter-raids during 1810.<ref name=\"JH112\">Henderson, p. 112</ref>\n[[File:001 Dubourdieu.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Captain [[Bernard Dubourdieu]]]]\n[[File:William-hoste-1-sized.jpg|thumb|150px|Captain William Hoste]]\n\nIn October 1810, Dubourdieu landed 700 Italian soldiers on Lissa while Hoste searched in vain for the French squadron in the Southern Adriatic.<ref name=\"RW253\">Woodman, p. 253</ref> The island had been left in the command of two [[midshipmen]], James Lew and Robert Kingston, who withdrew the entire population of the island into the central mountains along with their supplies.<ref name = \"JH119\"/> The Italian troops were left in possession of the deserted main town, [[Vis (town)|Port St. George]].<ref name=\"WJ256\">James, p. 256</ref> The French and Italians burnt several vessels in the harbour and captured others, but remained on the island for no more than seven hours, retreating before Hoste returned.<ref name=\"RG172\">Gardiner, p. 172</ref> The remainder of the year was quiet, the British squadron gaining superiority after being reinforced by the [[third-rate]] [[ship of the line]] [[HMS Montagu (1779)|HMS ''Montagu'']].<ref name=\"WLC472\">Clowes, p. 472</ref>\n\nEarly in 1811 the raiding campaigns began again, and British attacks along the Italian coast prompted Dubourdieu to mount a second invasion of Lissa. Taking advantage of the temporary absence of ''Montagu'', Dubourdieu assembled six frigates and numerous smaller craft and embarked over 500 Italian soldiers under Colonel Alexander Gifflenga.<ref>Sources differ on the spelling of Gifflenga's first name, using Alexander and Alexandre interchangeably.</ref> The squadron amassed by Dubourdieu not only outnumbered the British in terms of men and ships, it was also twice as heavy in weight of shot.<ref name=\"WJ360\">James, p. 360</ref> Dubourdieu planned to overwhelm Hoste's frigate squadron and then invade and capture the island, which would eradicate the British threat in the Adriatic for months to come.<ref name=\"JH113\"/>\n\n==Battle==\nDubourdieu (as [[Commodore (rank)|commodore]]) led a squadron consisting of six [[frigate]]s (four of 40 guns and two of 32 guns), a 16-gun [[brig]], two [[schooner]]s, one [[xebec]], and two [[gunboat]]s. Three of his ships were from the [[French Navy]], and the others from the Navy of the [[Kingdom of Italy (Napoleonic)|Kingdom of Italy]]. In addition the squadron carried 500 Italian soldiers. In the absence of ''Montagu'', Hoste's squadron consisted of three frigates (one of 38 guns and two of 32 guns) and one 22-gun [[post ship]]. The island of Lissa itself was defended by a small number of local troops under the command of two [[midshipmen]].\n\nDubourdieu's squadron was spotted approaching the island of Lissa at 03:00 on 12 March 1811 by Captain Gordon in [[HMS Active (1799)|HMS ''Active'']], which had led the British squadron from [[Vis (town)|Port St George]] on a cruise off Ancona.<ref name=\"RLA358\">Adkins, p. 358</ref> Turning west, the British squadron awaited the French approach in line ahead, sailing along the north coast of the island within half a mile of the shoreline. By 06:00, Dubourdieu was approaching the British line from the north-east in two divisions, leading in [[French frigate Favorite (1810)|''Favorite'']] at the head of the windward or western division. Dubourdieu hoped to pass ahead of ''Active'' at the head of the British line and cross it further east with [[French frigate Dana\u00e9 (1807)|''Dana\u00e9'']], which led the leeward division. Dubourdieu intended to break the British line in two places and destroy the British squadron in the crossfire.<ref name=\"RG173\">Gardiner, p. 173</ref>\n[[File:Battle of Lissa 1811 Map.png|thumb|300px|The opening stages of the battle]]\n\nOver the next three hours the squadrons continued to close, light winds restricting them to a little over three [[Knot (unit)|knots]].<ref name=\"WJ352\"/> A protege of Nelson, Hoste recalled the inspirational effect of [[England expects that every man will do his duty|Nelson's signal]] before the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] and raised his own: \"Remember Nelson\", which was greeted with wild cheering from the squadron.<ref name=\"JH113\">Henderson, p. 113</ref> As he closed with Hoste's force, Dubourdieu realised that he would be unable to successfully cross ''Active's'' bow due to the British ship's speed, and would also be unable to break through their line due to the British ships' close proximity to one another.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> He instead sought to attack the second ship in the British line, Hoste's flagship [[HMS Amphion (1799)|HMS ''Amphion'']]. Dubourdieu possessed not only a significant advantage in ships but also in men, the Italian soldiers aboard giving him the opportunity to overwhelm the British crews if he could board their frigates successfully.<ref name=\"JH113\"/> The first shots of the battle were fired at 09:00, as the British used their wider field of fire to attack the leading French ships, ''Favorite'' and ''Dana\u00e9'', unopposed for several minutes. The French squadron held their fire, Dubourdieu gathering his troops and sailors into ''Favorite'''s bow in order to maximise the effect of his initial attack once his flagship came into contact with ''Amphion''.<ref name=\"WJ352\"/>\n\nHoste was aware of Dubourdieu's intentions and the French advantage in numbers, and consequently ordered a large {{convert|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} [[howitzer]] on ''Amphion's'' deck [[Naval artillery in the Age of Sail#Shot|triple-shotted]] until the cannon contained over 750&nbsp;[[Musket#Ammunition|musket balls]]<ref name=\"RLA360\">Adkins, p. 360</ref> Once ''Favorite'' was within a few yards of ''Amphion'''s stern, Hoste gave permission for the gun to be fired and the cannon's discharge instantly swept the bow of ''Favorite'' clear of the French and Italian boarding party.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> Among the dozens killed and wounded were Dubourdieu and all the frigate's officers, leaving Colonel Gifflenga in command of ''Favorite''.<ref name=\"JH115\">Henderson, p. 115</ref> As ''Favorite'' and ''Amphion'' closed with one another, firing continued between the British rear and the French leeward division, led by ''Dana\u00e9''. Several of the French ships came at an angle at which they could bring their guns to bear on [[HMS Cerberus (1794)|HMS ''Cerberus'']], the rearmost British ship, and both sides were firing regular broadsides at one another.<ref name=\"WJ352\">James p. 352</ref>\n\n===Hoste's manoeuvre===\nFollowing the death of Dubourdieu, Captain P\u00e9ridier on [[French frigate Flore (1806)|''Flore'']] ordered the French and Venetian ships to attack the British line directly. The battered ''Favorite'' led with an attempt to round ''Amphion'' and [[Raking fire|rake]] her before catching her in crossfire, as had been Dubourdieu's original intention.<ref name=\"WJ353\">James p. 353</ref> The remainder of the Franco-Venetian squadron followed this lead and attempted to bring their superior numbers to bear on the British squadron. Hoste was prepared for this eventuality and immediately ordered his ships to [[Jibe|wear]], turning south and then east to reverse direction. This movement threw the Franco-Venetian squadron into confusion and as a result the squadron's formation became disorganised.<ref name=\"JH115\"/> ''Favorite'', which had lost almost its entire complement of officers, was unable to respond quickly enough to the manoeuvre and drove onto the rocky coastline in confusion, becoming a total wreck.<ref name=\"BI194\">Ireland p. 194</ref>\n\nThrown into further confusion by the loss of ''Favorite'', the French and Venetian formation began to break up and the British squadron was able to pull ahead of their opponents; the leading French ships ''Flore'' and ''Bellona'' succeeded in only reaching ''Amphion'', which was now at the rear of the British line.<ref name=\"RG173\"/> ''Amphion'' found herself caught between the two frigates and this slowed the British line enough that the French eastern division, led by ''Dana\u00e9'', was able to strike at [[HMS Volage (1807)|HMS ''Volage'']], now the leading British ship after overtaking ''Cerberus'' during the turn.<ref name=\"JH116\"/> ''Volage'' was much smaller than her opponent but was armed with 32-pounder [[carronade]]s, short range guns that caused such damage to ''Dana\u00e9'' that the French ship was forced to haul off and reengage from a longer range. The strain of combat at this greater distance ruptured ''Volage's'' short-ranged carronades and left the ship much weakened, with only a single gun with which to engage the enemy.<ref name=\"WJ354\">James p. 354</ref>\n\n===Chase===\n[[File:Battle of Lissa.jpg|300px|thumb|''Battle of Lissa, 13 March 1811''<br />Engraved by [[Henri Merke]] after a painting by [[George Webster (painter)|George Webster]], 1812]]\nBehind ''Volage'' and ''Dana\u00e9'', the Venetian ''Corona'' had engaged ''Cerberus'' in a close range duel, during which ''Cerberus'' took heavy damage but inflicted similar injuries on the Italian ship. This exchange continued until the arrival of ''Active'' caused the ''Dana\u00e9'', ''Corona'' and ''Carolina'' to sheer off and retreat to the east.<ref name=\"WJ355\">James p. 355</ref> To the rear, ''Amphion'' succeeded in closing with and raking ''Flore'', and caused such damage that within five minutes the French ship's officers threw the [[French tricolour|French colours]] overboard in surrender. Captain P\u00e9ridier had been seriously wounded in the action, and took no part in ''Flore'''s later movements. ''Amphion'' then attacked ''Bellona'' and in an engagement that lasted until 12:00, forced the Italian ship's surrender.<ref name=\"RW255\">Woodman p. 255</ref> During this combat, the small ship ''Principessa Augusta'' fired on ''Amphion'' from a distance, until the frigate was able to turn a gun on them and drive them off.<ref name=\"RG174\">Gardiner, p. 174</ref> Hoste sent a [[punt (boat)|punt]] to take possession of ''Bellona'' but due to the damage suffered was unable to launch a boat to seize ''Flore''. Realising ''Amphion's'' difficulty, the officers of ''Flore'', who had made hasty repairs during the conflict between ''Amphion'' and ''Bellona'', immediately set sail for the French harbour on [[Hvar|Lesina]] (Hvar), despite having already surrendered.<ref name=\"JH116\">Henderson, p. 116</ref><ref name=\"RG174\"/>\n\n''Active'', the only British ship still in fighting condition, took up pursuit of the retreating enemy and at 12:30 caught the ''Corona'' in the channel between Lissa and the small island of Spalmadon.<ref name=\"JH117\">Henderson, p. 117</ref> The frigates manoeuvred around one another for the next hour; captains Gordon and Pasqualigo each seeking the best position from which to engage. The frigates engaged in combat at 13.45, ''Active'' forcing ''Corona'''s surrender 45&nbsp;minutes later after a fire broke out aboard the Italian ship.<ref name=\"RLA361\">Adkins, p. 361</ref> ''Active'' too had suffered severely and as the British squadron was not strong enough to continue the action by attacking the remaining squadron in its protected harbour on Lesina, the battle came to an end.<ref name=\"JH119\"/> The survivors of the Franco-Venetian squadron had all reached safety; ''Carolina'' and ''Dana\u00e9'' had used the conflict between ''Active'' and ''Corona'' to cover their escape while ''Flore'' had indicated to each British ship she passed that she had surrendered and was in British possession despite the absence of a British officer on board. Once ''Flore'' was clear of the British squadron she headed for safety, reaching the batteries of Lesina shortly after her ''Carolina'' and ''Dana\u00e9'' and ahead of the limping British pursuit. The smaller craft of the Franco-Venetian squadron scattered during the battle's final stages and reached Lesina independently.<ref name=\"JH119\"/>\n\n===Conclusion===\n[[File:BattleofLissa1811(2).jpg|300px|thumb|The latter stages of the battle. The burning '' [[French frigate Favorite (1810)|Favorite]]'' can be seen in the background.<br />Engraving by Henri Merke after a painting by George Webster, 1812]]\nAlthough ''Favorite'' was wrecked, over 200 of her crew and soldier-passengers had reached the land and, having set fire to their ship, prepared to march on Port St. George under the leadership of Colonel Gifflenga. Two British midshipmen left in command of the town organised the British and indigenous population into a defensive force and marched to meet Gifflenga. The junior British officers informed Gifflenga that the return of the British squadron would bring overwhelming numbers of sailors, marines and naval artillery to bear on his small force and that if he surrendered immediately he could expect better terms. Gifflenga recognised that his position was untenable and capitulated.<ref name=\"RG174\"/><ref name=\"WJ361\">James, p. 361</ref> At Port St. George, the Venetian gunboat ''Lodola'' sneaked unnoticed into the harbour and almost captured a Sicilian privateer, ''Vincitore''. The raider was driven off by the remaining garrison of the town without the prize, while attempting to manoeuvre her out of the bay.<ref name=\"RW256\">Woodman p. 256</ref>\n\nIn the seas off Lissa, British prize crews were making strenuous efforts to protect their captures; ''Corona'' was heavily on fire in consequence of her engagement with ''Active'' and the British prize crew fought the blaze alongside their Italian prisoners. The fire was eventually brought under control, but not without the death of five men and several more seriously burnt when the blazing mainmast collapsed.<ref name=\"WJ358\"/> Problems were also experienced aboard ''Bellona'', where Captain Duodo planned to ignite the powder magazine and destroy the ship following its surrender. Duodo had been mortally wounded in the action, and so ordered his second in command to light the fuse. The officer promised to do so, but instead handed control of the magazine to the British prize crew when they arrived. Duodo died still believing that the fuse had been lit.<ref name=\"WJ358\">James, p. 358</ref>\n\nHoste also remained at sea, cruising in the battered ''Amphion'' beyond the range of the shore batteries on Lesina. Hoste was furious at the behaviour of ''Flore's'' officers and sent a note into Lesina demanding that they give up the ship as indicated by its earlier surrender.<ref name=\"WJ361\"/> In surrendering and then escaping, the officers of ''Flore'' had breached an informal rule of naval conflict under which a ship that voluntarily struck its flag submitted to an opponent in order to prevent continued loss of life among its crew. ''Flore'' had been able to pass unmolested through the British squadron only because she was recognised to have surrendered, and to abuse this custom in this way was considered, in the Royal Navy especially, to be a dishonourable act.<ref name=\"JH119\"/><ref name=\"WJ361\"/> The French at Lesina did not respond to Hoste's note, and the British squadron was eventually forced to return to Lissa to effect repairs.\n\n==Aftermath==\nCasualties of the action were heavy on both sides. The British ships suffered 190 killed or wounded in the battle and a number lost afterwards in the fire aboard ''Corona''. Captains Hoste and Hornby were both badly wounded and the entire British squadron was in need of urgent repair before resuming the campaign.<ref name=\"WJ357\"/> In the French and Italian squadron the situation was even worse, although precise losses are not known. At least 150 had been killed aboard ''Favorite'' either in the action or the wreck, and the 200 survivors of her crew and passengers were all made prisoner. ''Bellona'' had suffered at least 70 casualties and ''Corona's'' losses were also severe.<ref name=\"WJ357\">James, p. 357</ref> Among the ships that escaped less is known of their casualties, but all required repair and reinforcement before the campaign could resume. Total French and Italian losses are estimated at no less than 700.<ref name=\"RG174\"/> Losses among the officers of the combined squadron were especially high, with Commodore Dubourdieu and captains Meillerie and Duodo killed and P\u00e9ridier seriously wounded.\n\nThe immediate aftermath saw renewed efforts by Hoste to induce the French to hand over ''Flore'', efforts that were rebuffed by the captain of the ''Dana\u00e9'', who had assumed command of the French squadron.<ref name=\"WJ361\"/> The surviving French and Venetian ships were initially laid up in [[Dubrovnik|Ragusa]] (Dubrovnik) awaiting supplies to continue the campaign, but a separate British squadron discovered and sank the supply ship at [[Pore\u010d|Parenzo]] (Pore\u010d), necessitating a full French withdrawal from the area.<ref name=\"RG174\"/> In Britain, Hoste's action was widely praised; the squadron's first lieutenants were all promoted to commander and the captains all presented with a commemorative medal.<ref name=\"BI194\"/><ref name=\"JH120\">Henderson, p. 120</ref> Nearly four decades later the battle was also recognized in the issue of the clasp ''Lissa'' to the [[Naval General Service Medal (1847)|Naval General Service Medal]], awarded to all British participants still living in 1847.<ref name=\"LG4\">{{London Gazette|issue=20939|pages=236\u2013245|date=26 January 1849}}</ref> On their arrival in Britain, ''Corona'' and ''Bellone'' were repaired and later purchased for service in the Royal Navy, the newly built ''Corona'' being named {{HMS|Daedalus|1811|6}} and ''Bellone'' becoming the [[troopship]] {{HMS|Dover|1811|6}}.<ref name=\"JH119\">Henderson, p. 119</ref> ''Daedalus'' was commissioned in 1812 under Captain [[Murray Maxwell]], but served less than a year; wrecked off [[Ceylon]] in July 1813.<ref name=\"TG357\">Grocott, p. 357</ref>\n\nBritish numerical superiority in the region was assured; when French reinforcements for the Adriatic departed [[Toulon]] on 25 March they were hunted down and driven back to France by Captain [[Robert Otway]] in {{HMS|Ajax|1809|6}} before they had even passed [[Corsica]].<ref name=\"WJ362\">James p. 362</ref> Throughout the remainder of 1811 however, British and French frigate squadrons continued to spar across the Adriatic, the most significant engagement being the [[action of 29 November 1811]], in which a second French squadron was destroyed.<ref name=\"RG178\">Gardiner, p. 178</ref> The action had significant long-term effects; the destruction of one of the best-trained and best-led squadrons in the French Navy and the death of the aggressive Dubourdieu ended the French ability to strike into the Balkans against the Ottoman Empire.<ref name=\"RLA363\">Adkins, p. 363</ref>\n\n==Order of battle==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" width=100%\n|-valign=\"top\"\n!colspan=\"11\" bgcolor=\"white\"|Captain Hoste's squadron\n|- valign=\"top\"|- valign=\"top\"\n!
