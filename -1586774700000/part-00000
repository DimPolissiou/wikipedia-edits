Directed by [[Andrew Adamson]] and [[Vicky Jenson]] in their [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debuts]], it stars [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[John Lithgow]] as the [[voice acting|voices]] of the lead characters. In the story, an ogre called [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished by the corrupt [[Lord Farquaad]] (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control of his swamp in return for rescuing [[Princess Fiona]] (Diaz), whom Farquaad intends to marry. With the help of [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] (Murphy), Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever.\n\nThe rights to Steig's book were purchased by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 1991. He originally planned to produce a traditionally-animated film based on the book, but [[John H. Williams]] convinced him to bring the film to the newly-founded [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] in 1994. [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] began active development of the film in 1995 immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. [[Chris Farley]] was originally cast as the voice for the title character, recording nearly all of the required dialogue. After Farley died in 1997 before the work was finished, [[Mike Myers]] stepped in to voice the character, which was changed to a Scottish accent in the process. The film was intended to be motion-captured, but after poor results, the studio decided to hire [[Pacific Data Images]] to complete the final computer animation.\n\n''Shrek'' premiered at the [[2001 Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]],<ref name=\"festival-cannes.com2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/1100045/year/2001.html|title=Shrek|publisher=Festival de Cannes|accessdate=October 18, 2009}}</ref> making it the first animated film since Disney's ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953) to receive that honor.<ref name=\":0\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/may/21/cannes2001.cannesfilmfestival1|title=Shrek scores at the US box office|date=May 21, 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=February 7, 2012|location=London}}</ref> It was widely praised as an animated film that featured adult-oriented humor and themes, while catering to children at the same time. The film was theatrically released in the United States on May 18, 2001, and grossed $484.4&nbsp;million worldwide against production budget of $60&nbsp;million. ''Shrek'' won the first ever [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]] and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. It also earned six award nominations from the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]] (BAFTA), ultimately winning [[BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. The film's success helped establish [[DreamWorks Animation]] as a prime competitor to [[Pixar]] in feature film computer animation, and three sequels were released\u2014''[[Shrek 2]]'' (2004), ''[[Shrek the Third]]'' (2007), and ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' (2010)\u2014along with two holiday specials, a [[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|spin-off film]], and [[Shrek the Musical|a stage musical]] that kickstarted the [[Shrek (franchise)|''Shrek'' franchise]].

Angered by the intrusion, he decides to ask Farquaad to exile them elsewhere, bringing Donkey along as he is the only one willing to guide him to Duloc.\n\nMeanwhile, Farquaad's torture of the [[List of Shrek characters#The Gingerbread Man|Gingerbread Man]] for the location of the remaining fairytale creatures is interrupted when his guards present him with a [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]]. He asks the Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest of them all but is told that he is not even a king, and that he must marry a princess. Farquaad resolves to marry [[Princess Fiona]], who is locked in a castle tower guarded by a dragon. Unwilling to perform the task himself, he organizes a tournament wherein the winner gets the \"privilege\" of rescuing Fiona for him. Shrek and Donkey arrive during the tournament, and ignorantly defeat Farquaad's knights. Farquaad proclaims them the champions, and compels them under threat of death to rescue Fiona, promising to move the fairytale creatures from Shrek's swamp if he succeeds.\n\nShrek and Donkey travel to the castle to find Fiona. They are attacked by a [[List of Shrek characters#Dragon|Dragon]], who corners Donkey. In desperation, he sweet-talks the beast, learning that it is female. Dragon falls in love with Donkey and carries him to her chambers. Meanwhile, Shrek finds Fiona, who is appalled at his lack of romanticism and surprised he had not slain Dragon. They leave after rescuing Donkey, and Fiona is thrilled to be rescued but is quickly disappointed when Shrek reveals he is an ogre. Despite her demands that Farquaad come get her in person, Shrek forcibly carries her as he ventures back to Duloc with Donkey. At night, Shrek explains to Donkey his frustration at how society judges him for how he looks; Fiona overhears this, and decides to be kind to Shrek. The three encounter [[List of Shrek characters#\"Monsieur\" Robin Hood|Robin Hood]] on their way back, where it is revealed that Fiona is an expert martial artist. Shrek and Fiona find they have much in common and begin to fall in love.\n\nWhen the trio is almost at Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey hears strange noises from within and investigates, finding Fiona transformed into an ogress. Fiona reveals that she was cursed during childhood to transform every night, and that only her true love's kiss will change her to \"love's true form\". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, but then overhears part of their conversation and becomes upset after mistaking her calling herself an \"ugly beast\" as disgust towards him. At Donkey's suggestion, Fiona vows to tell Shrek about her curse, but sees that Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad to the windmill. Confused and hurt by Shrek's sudden cold disposition towards her, Fiona accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests they be married before nightfall. The couple return to Duloc, while Shrek angrily abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp.\n\nAngered, Donkey arrives at the swamp and confronts a still upset Shrek. Donkey explains that the \"ugly beast\" Fiona was referring to was someone else, and the two reconcile. Donkey urges Shrek to express his feelings for Fiona before she is married, and the two travel to Duloc quickly by riding Dragon, who had escaped her confines and followed Donkey.\n\nShrek interrupts the wedding before Farquaad can kiss Fiona; he tells her that Farquaad is not her true love and is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets, which turns Fiona into an ogress in front of everyone, causing a surprised Shrek to understand what he overheard. Outraged, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona detained. Dragon bursts in alongside Donkey and devours Farquaad alive. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss, and Fiona's curse is lifted. While Fiona is surprised and disappointed to see that she is still an ogress despite the fact that she was supposed to become beautiful, Shrek states that she already is beautiful. They marry in the swamp and leave on their honeymoon.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Shrek characters}}\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]<ref>{{cite news|author=Stars and Stories |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3665827/Mike-Myers-how-I-nailed-Shreks-accent.html |title=Mike Myers: how I nailed Shrek's accent |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=June 15, 2007 |accessdate=January 21, 2014 |location=London}}</ref> and [[Three Blind Mice (Shrek)|Blind Mouse]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/tellmemore/2010/05/21/127034341/hollywood-s-million-dollar-donkey |title=Eddie Murphy: Hollywood's Million-Dollar Donkey : Tell Me More |publisher=NPR |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as [[Princess Fiona]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/movies/16shrek.html|title=Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz on 'Shrek' |work=The New York Times |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=January 11, 2014 |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff}}</ref>\n* [[John Lithgow]] as [[Lord Farquaad]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Bradshaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jun/29/1 |title=Shrek &#124; Film |website=The Guardian |date=June 29, 2001 |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as [[List of Shrek characters#Monsieur Robin Hood|\"Monsieur\" Robin Hood]]<ref>{{cite news|author= Paul Willis For CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/08/12/cassel.profile/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title=Vincent Cassel: Playing France's tough guys |publisher=CNN |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as [[Gingerbread Man (Shrek)|Gingerbread Man]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Brian |first=Greg |url=https://news.yahoo.com/conrad-vernon-today-funniest-unknown-voice-actor-shrek-203200437.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219003147/https://news.yahoo.com/conrad-vernon-today-funniest-unknown-voice-actor-shrek-203200437.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 19, 2014 |title=Conrad Vernon: Today's funniest unknown voice actor, from 'Shrek' to 'Madagascar 3' \u2013 Yahoo News |publisher=Yahoo!

For some elements, however, it also took advantage of some of the powerhouse animation software in the market. This is particularly true with [[Autodesk Maya|Maya]], which PDI used for most of its dynamic cloth animation and for the hair of Fiona and Farquaad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalmediafx.com/Shrek/shrekfaq.html|title=Shrek FAQ|publisher=Digital Media FX|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n\"We did a lot of work on character and set-up, and then kept changing the set up while we were doing the animation,\" Hui noted. \"In ''Antz'', we had a facial system that gave us all the facial muscles under the skin. In ''Shrek'', we applied that to whole body. So, if you pay attention to Shrek when he talks, you see that when he opens his jaw, he forms a double chin, because we have the fat and the muscles underneath. That kind of detail took us a long time to get right.\"{{sfn|Blair|2001|p=2}} One of the most difficult parts of creating the film was making Donkey's fur flow smoothly so that it didn't look like that of a [[Chia Pet]]. This fell into the hands of the surfacing animators who used flow controls within a complex shader to provide the fur with many attributes (ability to change directions, lie flat, swirl, etc.).<ref name = \"dmfanimatingshrek\"/> It was then the job of the visual effects group, led by Ken Bielenberg, to make the fur react to environment conditions. Once the technology was mastered, it was able to be applied to many aspects of the ''Shrek'' movie including [[grass]], [[moss]], [[beard]]s, [[eyebrow]]s, and even threads on Shrek's tunic. Making human hair realistic was different from Donkey's fur, requiring a separate rendering system and a lot of attention from the [[lighting]] and [[visual effects]] teams.<ref name = \"dmfanimatingshrek\"/>\n\n''Shrek'' has 31 sequences, with 1,288 shots in every sequence total.<ref name = \"Production Information on Culture.com\"/> Aron Warner said that the creators \"envisioned a magical environment that you could immerse yourself into\". Shrek includes 36 separate in-film locations to make the world of the film, which DreamWorks claimed was more than any previous computer-animated feature before. In-film locations were finalized and as demonstrated by past DreamWorks animated movies, color and mood was of the utmost importance.<ref name = \"dmfanimatingshrek\"/>\n\n===Music===\n{{Main|Shrek: Music from the Original Motion Picture}}\n''Shrek'' is the third DreamWorks animated film (and the only film in the [[Shrek (franchise)|Shrek series]]) to have [[Harry Gregson-Williams]] team up with [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]] to compose the score following ''[[Antz]]'' (1998) and ''[[Chicken Run]]'' (2000).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Burlingame|first1=Jon|title=Gregson-Williams scores many toons|url=https://variety.com/2009/film/news/gregson-williams-scores-many-toons-1118002752/|accessdate=March 8, 2015|work=Variety|date=April 22, 2009|quote=The first three \u2013 \"Antz,\" \"Chicken Run\" and \"Shrek\" \u2013 were jointly done by Gregson-Williams and Powell,...}}</ref> [[John Powell (composer)|John Powell]] was left out to compose scores for later Shrek films with Williams due to a conflict.<ref name = \"George Lucas's Blockbusting\">{{cite book| author = Alex Ben Block, Lucy Autrey Wilson| page = [https://archive.org/details/georgelucassbloc00alex/page/885 885]| title = George Lucas's Blockbusting: A Decade-by-Decade Survey of Timeless Movies Including Untold Secrets of Their Financial and Cultural Success| year = 2010| publisher = HarperCollins| isbn = 978-0061778896| url-access = registration| url = https://archive.org/details/georgelucassbloc00alex/page/885}}</ref> The score was recorded at [[Abbey Road Studios]] by Nick Wollage and Slamm Andrews, with the latter mixing it at Media Ventures and Patricia Sullivan-Fourstar handling mastering.<ref>{{cite book|title= Shrek (Original Motion Picture Score) |id=302 066 308 2|year=2001}}</ref>\n\n''Shrek'' introduced a new element to give the film a unique feel.

An alternative explanation is that, although the filmmakers wanted Cale's version for the film, licensing issues prevented its use in the soundtrack album, because Wainwright was an artist for [[DreamWorks Records|DreamWorks]] but Cale was not.<ref>{{cite book |title=There Will Be Rainbows: A Biography of Rufus Wainwright|last=Lake |first=Kirk |authorlink= |author2= |year=2010 |publisher=Skyhorse Publishing Inc. |location= |isbn=978-0-06-198846-2 |page= |pages=141\u2013142 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9_t9aUJBqT0C&pg=PA141 |accessdate=May 14, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Cultural references==\nIn many places the film references classic movies, predominantly those by [[Walt Disney Animation Studios|Disney]].

DreamWorks was so impressed by the technology used for the sequence's \"stereoscopic translation\", that the studio and IMAX decided to plan a big-screen 3D version of ''Shrek''. The film would have been re-released during the Christmas season of 2001, or the following summer, after its conventional 2D release. The re-release would have also included new sequences and an alternate ending.

Directed by [[Andrew Adamson]] and [[Vicky Jenson]] in their [[List of directorial debuts|directorial debuts]], it stars [[Mike Myers]], [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[John Lithgow]] as the [[voice acting|voices]] of the lead characters. In the story, an ogre called [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]] (Myers) finds his swamp overrun by fairy tale creatures who have been banished by the corrupt [[Lord Farquaad]] (Lithgow) aspiring to be king. Shrek makes a deal with Farquaad to regain control of his swamp in return for rescuing [[Princess Fiona]] (Diaz), whom Farquaad intends to marry. With the help of [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]] (Murphy), Shrek embarks on his quest but soon falls in love with the princess, who is hiding a secret that will change his life forever.\n\nThe rights to Steig's book were purchased by [[Steven Spielberg]] in 1991. He originally planned to produce a traditionally-animated film based on the book, but [[John H. Williams]] convinced him to bring the film to the newly-founded [[DreamWorks Pictures|DreamWorks]] in 1994. [[Jeffrey Katzenberg]] began active development of the film in 1995 immediately following the studio's purchase of the rights from Spielberg. [[Chris Farley]] was originally cast as the voice for the title character, recording nearly all of the required dialogue.

The film was theatrically released in the United States on May 18, 2001, and grossed $484.4&nbsp;million worldwide against production budget of $60&nbsp;million.

Angered by the intrusion, he decides to ask Farquaad to exile them elsewhere, bringing Donkey along as he is the only one willing to guide him to Duloc.\n\nMeanwhile, Farquaad's torture of the [[List of Shrek characters#The Gingerbread Man|Gingerbread Man]] for the location of the remaining fairytale creatures is interrupted when his guards present him with a [[Magic Mirror (Snow White)|Magic Mirror]]. He asks the Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest of them all but is told that he is not even a king, and that he must marry a princess. Farquaad resolves to marry [[Princess Fiona]], who is locked in a castle tower guarded by a dragon. Unwilling to perform the task himself, he organizes a tournament wherein the winner gets the \"privilege\" of rescuing Fiona for him. Shrek and Donkey arrive during the tournament, and ignorantly defeat Farquaad's knights. Farquaad proclaims them the champions, and compels them under threat of death to rescue Fiona, promising to move the fairytale creatures from Shrek's swamp if he succeeds.\n\nShrek and Donkey travel to the castle to find Fiona. They are attacked by a [[List of Shrek characters#Dragon|Dragon]], who corners Donkey. In desperation, he sweet-talks the beast, learning that it is female. Dragon falls in love with Donkey and carries him to her chambers. Meanwhile, Shrek finds Fiona, who is appalled at his lack of romanticism and surprised he had not slain Dragon. They leave after rescuing Donkey, and Fiona is thrilled to be rescued but is quickly disappointed when Shrek reveals he is an ogre. Despite her demands that Farquaad come get her in person, Shrek forcibly carries her as he ventures back to Duloc with Donkey. At night, Shrek explains to Donkey his frustration at how society judges him for how he looks; Fiona overhears this, and decides to be kind to Shrek. The three encounter [[List of Shrek characters#\"Monsieur\" Robin Hood|Robin Hood]] on their way back, where it is revealed that Fiona is an expert martial artist. Shrek and Fiona find they have much in common and begin to fall in love.\n\nWhen the trio is almost at Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey hears strange noises from within and investigates, finding Fiona transformed into an ogress. Fiona reveals that she was cursed during childhood to transform every night, and that only her true love's kiss will change her to \"love's true form\". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, but then overhears part of their conversation and becomes upset after mistaking her calling herself an \"ugly beast\" as disgust towards him. At Donkey's suggestion, Fiona vows to tell Shrek about her curse, but sees that Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad to the windmill. Confused and hurt by Shrek's sudden cold disposition towards her, Fiona accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests they be married before nightfall. The couple return to Duloc, while Shrek angrily abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp.\n\nAngered, Donkey arrives at the swamp and confronts a still upset Shrek. Donkey explains that the \"ugly beast\" Fiona was referring to was someone else, and the two reconcile. Donkey urges Shrek to express his feelings for Fiona before she is married, and the two travel to Duloc quickly by riding Dragon, who had escaped her confines and followed Donkey.\n\nShrek interrupts the wedding before Farquaad can kiss Fiona; he tells her that Farquaad is not her true love and is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets, which turns Fiona into an ogress in front of everyone, causing a surprised Shrek to understand what he overheard. Outraged, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona detained. Dragon bursts in alongside Donkey and devours Farquaad alive. Shrek and Fiona profess their love and share a kiss, and Fiona's curse is lifted. While Fiona is surprised and disappointed to see that she is still an ogress despite the fact that she was supposed to become beautiful, Shrek states that she already is beautiful. They marry in the swamp and leave on their honeymoon.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Main|List of Shrek characters}}\n* [[Mike Myers]] as [[Shrek (character)|Shrek]]<ref>{{cite news|author=Stars and Stories |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/starsandstories/3665827/Mike-Myers-how-I-nailed-Shreks-accent.html |title=Mike Myers: how I nailed Shrek's accent |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=June 15, 2007 |accessdate=January 21, 2014 |location=London}}</ref> and [[Three Blind Mice (Shrek)|Blind Mouse]]<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n* [[Eddie Murphy]] as [[Donkey (Shrek)|Donkey]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/tellmemore/2010/05/21/127034341/hollywood-s-million-dollar-donkey |title=Eddie Murphy: Hollywood's Million-Dollar Donkey : Tell Me More |publisher=NPR |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] as [[Princess Fiona]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/16/movies/16shrek.html|title=Mike Myers and Cameron Diaz on 'Shrek' |work=The New York Times |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=January 11, 2014 |first=Dave |last=Itzkoff}}</ref>\n* [[John Lithgow]] as [[Lord Farquaad]]<ref>{{cite web|author=Peter Bradshaw |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2001/jun/29/1 |title=Shrek &#124; Film |website=The Guardian |date=June 29, 2001 |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Vincent Cassel]] as [[List of Shrek characters#Monsieur Robin Hood|\"Monsieur\" Robin Hood]]<ref>{{cite news|author= Paul Willis For CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/08/12/cassel.profile/index.html?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title=Vincent Cassel: Playing France's tough guys |publisher=CNN |date=August 24, 2009 |accessdate=January 21, 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Conrad Vernon]] as [[Gingerbread Man (Shrek)|Gingerbread Man]]<ref>{{cite web|last=Brian |first=Greg |url=https://news.yahoo.com/conrad-vernon-today-funniest-unknown-voice-actor-shrek-203200437.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219003147/https://news.yahoo.com/conrad-vernon-today-funniest-unknown-voice-actor-shrek-203200437.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=February 19, 2014 |title=Conrad Vernon: Today's funniest unknown voice actor, from 'Shrek' to 'Madagascar 3' \u2013 Yahoo News |publisher=Yahoo!

For this reason, task-evoked pupillary response has potential to be used as a measure of cognitive load.\n\n=== Diagnosticity ===\nTask-evoked pupillary response is not diagnostic when the cognitive load is related to task performance.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is because the pupillary response is the same for a large array of activities that require mental effort including perceptual, cognitive and response related tasks. Instead, task-evoked pupillary response can be observed as a measure of cognitive load. However, task-evoked pupillary response appears to be diagnostic when it comes to data-limited processing.<ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":0\" /> For example, if presented with changes to weak auditory stimuli, the pupil will not demonstrate any changes in diameter but will instead be affected by changes to experimental conditions.\n\n=== Task Performance ===\nSome studies suggest pupillary dilation due to task-evoked pupillary response is associated with greater task performance.<ref name=\":2\" /> For example, when taking part in an experiment involving the [[n-back]] task, a correlation was observed between those with higher dilation, due to pupillary response, and improved performance.\n\nConversely, other studies show the opposite relationship, where higher pupillary dilation is associated with lower task performance.<ref name=\":2\" /> When presented with a task measuring the [[Stroop effect]], higher pupil dilation positively correlated with the size of the Stroop effect. This is suggested to be because those who are poor at a test regarding incongruencies must put in more mental effort than those more skilled at stopping themselves when faced with incongruency.
