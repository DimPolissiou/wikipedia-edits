[[Cox Communications]] refused to carry the station at first, but by November 2000 began to carry it on channel 14 after customer demand from ''[[Star Trek]]'' fans and ahead of UPN's coverage of the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] football league featuring the [[Las Vegas Outlaws (XFL)|Las Vegas Outlaws]] locally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2000/oct/05/cox-adding-upn-television-network-to-vegas-system/|title=Cox adding UPN television network to Vegas system|date=5 October 2000|work=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref> DirecTV eventually also picked up the station, though Dish Network never did.\n\nThe station's standing was severely affected by the January 2006 announcement that The WB and UPN would merge into one network, [[The CW]]. Unlike in 1999 when the market's main independent stations were all owned separately and the ability for KTUD-LP to receive the UPN affiliation was easier, by 2006 both KVWB and independent [[KVCW|KFBT]] were owned by [[Sinclair Broadcasting Group]], which was one of the largest affiliate groups for both The WB and UPN. KVWB was part of an early bulk affiliation deal for [[MyNetworkTV]], with the CW affiliation still up for grabs by mid-April 2006. However, KTUD-LP withdrew from negotiations with the CW on April 24, 2006.<ref>[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Apr-26-Wed-2006/living/7046892.html Second local affiliate rejects new CW]</ref> KFBT was thus announced as the market's CW affiliate on May 2, 2006, and KTUD-LP was left to become an independent station when UPN ended operations in September 2006.\n\nOn September 18, 2009, KTUD-LD signed on its digital signal on channel 20.\n\nThe 2008 recession that heavily affected the Las Vegas Valley and slashed advertising revenue, and a lack of a network affiliation, eventually lead to the LLC behind KTUD-LP to file for bankruptcy protection in late February 2010, though no on-air operations were affected at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/26/ktud-file-bankruptcy-reorganization/|title=KTUD files for bankruptcy reorganization|last=Green|first=Steve|date=27 February 2010|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn March 16, 2012, the station transferred its class A license over to their digital signal, with the call sign changing to KTUD-CD.

In the fall of 2006 when KTUD became an independent station, that station was rebranded on-air as \"Vegas TV\" and the newscasts was renamed to suit the new identity. Shortly afterward however, the station dropped the 10 p.m. newscast and Saunders would later go to KTNV. KTUD later revived its 10 p.m. newscast, under a news share agreement with [[NBC]] affiliate [[KSNV-DT]] (channel 3), which debuted in October 2009 and ran until its cancellation in August 2010.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090926062236/http://www.vegastv.com/ Official website, defunct]\n*[http://www.facebook.com/vegastv VegasTV on Facebook]\n*{{TVQ|KTUD-CD}}\n\n{{Las Vegas TV}}\n\n{{coord|36.067143|-115.123214|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Television stations in the Las Vegas Valley|Tud-Cd]]\n[[Category:Independent television stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Digital low-power stations]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1999]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2014]]\n[[Category:Defunct television stations in the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox broadcast\n| call_letters             = KTUD-CD\n| station_logo             = Vegastv.png\n| logo_size                = 150px\n| station_branding         = Vegas TV\n| station_slogan           = ''Fun TV is Vegas TV!''\n| digital                  = 20 ([[Ultra High Frequency|UHF]])<br>[[Virtual channel|Virtual]]: 25 ([[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]])\n| affiliations             = [[Independent station (North America)|independent]]\n| founded                  = February 12, 1999\n| enddate                  = October 10, 2013<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/business/ktud-tv-channel-25-expected-leave-las-vegas-airwaves|title=KTUD-TV, Channel 25, expected to leave Las Vegas airwaves|date=10 October 2013|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>\n| location                 = [[Las Vegas, Nevada]]\n| country                  = [[United States]]\n| callsign_meaning         = possibly from the word \"atti'''tud'''e\"\n| former_callsigns         = '''Analog:''' K69HA (1999)<br>K25FS (1999)<br>KCNG-LP (1999\u20132000)<br>KTUD-LP (2000\u20132003)<br>KTUD-CA (2003\u20132012)<br>'''Digital:''' KTUD-LD (2008\u20132012)\n| former_channel_numbers   = '''Analog:'''<br>25 (1999\u20132009)\n| owner                    = VegasTV, LLC<br> {{small|([[The Greenspun Corporation]], 60%)}}\n| licensee                 =\n| former_affiliations = [[America's Voice]] <br> [[UPN]] (1999\u20132006)\n| effective_radiated_power = 8.9 [[kilowatt|kW]]\n| HAAT                     =\n| facility_id              = 167820\n| coordinates              = {{coord|35|56|44.00|N|115|02|33.00|W|type:landmark_scale:2000}}\n| class                    = [[Class A television service|Class A]]\n}}\n\n'''KTUD-CD''', [[virtual channel]] 25.1 (digital channel 20), was an [[Independent station (North America)|independent]] [[television station]] that served the [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] market owned and operated by Greenspun Broadcasting, a wholly owned subsidiary of [[The Greenspun Corporation]].

[[Cox Communications]] refused to carry the station at first, but by November 2000 began to carry it on channel 14 after customer demand from ''[[Star Trek]]'' fans and ahead of UPN's coverage of the [[XFL (2001)|XFL]] football league featuring the [[Las Vegas Outlaws (XFL)|Las Vegas Outlaws]] locally.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2000/oct/05/cox-adding-upn-television-network-to-vegas-system/|title=Cox adding UPN television network to Vegas system|date=5 October 2000|work=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref> DirecTV eventually also picked up the station, though Dish Network never did.\n\nThe station's standing was severely affected by the January 2006 announcement that The WB and UPN would merge into one network, [[The CW]]. Unlike in 1999 when the market's main independent stations were all owned separately and the ability for KTUD-LP to receive the UPN affiliation was easier, by 2006 both KVWB and independent [[KVCW|KFBT]] were owned by [[Sinclair Broadcasting Group]], which was one of the largest affiliate groups for both The WB and UPN. KVWB was part of an early bulk affiliation deal for [[MyNetworkTV]], with the CW affiliation still up for grabs by mid-April 2006. However, KTUD-LP withdrew from negotiations with the CW on April 24, 2006.<ref>[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Apr-26-Wed-2006/living/7046892.html Second local affiliate rejects new CW]</ref> KFBT was thus announced as the market's CW affiliate on May 2, 2006, and KTUD-LP was left to become an independent station when UPN ended operations in September 2006.\n\nOn September 18, 2009, KTUD-LD signed on its digital signal on channel 20.\n\nThe 2008 recession that heavily affected the Las Vegas Valley and slashed advertising revenue, and a lack of a network affiliation, eventually lead to the LLC behind KTUD-LP to file for bankruptcy protection in late February 2010, though no on-air operations were affected at the time.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2010/feb/26/ktud-file-bankruptcy-reorganization/|title=KTUD files for bankruptcy reorganization|last=Green|first=Steve|date=27 February 2010|work=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|accessdate=11 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nOn March 16, 2012, the station transferred its class A license over to their digital signal, with the call sign changing to KTUD-CD. Simultaneously, the analog license was cancelled by the FCC and the KTUD-CA call sign was deleted from the FCC's database.\n\n===Station closure===\nOn October 10, 2013, KTUD announced that it would leave the airwaves as of 11:59pm that evening due to insufficient advertising revenues; in addition, The Greenspun Corporation has been struggling as of late.

In the fall of 2006 when KTUD became an independent station, that station was rebranded on-air as \"Vegas TV\" and the newscasts was renamed to suit the new identity. Shortly afterward however, the station dropped the 10 p.m. newscast and Saunders would later go to KTNV. KTUD later revived its 10 p.m. newscast, under a news share agreement with [[NBC]] affiliate [[KSNV-DT]] (channel 3), which debuted in October 2009 and ran until its cancellation in August 2010.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090926062236/http://www.vegastv.com/ Official website, defunct]\n*[http://www.facebook.com/vegastv VegasTV on Facebook]\n*{{TVQ|KTUD-CD}}\n\n{{Las Vegas TV}}\n\n{{coord|36.067143|-115.123214|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Television stations in the Las Vegas Valley|Tud-Cd]]\n[[Category:Independent television stations in the United States]]\n[[Category:Digital low-power stations]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations established in 1999]]\n[[Category:Television channels and stations disestablished in 2014]]\n[[Category:Defunct television stations in the United States]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toAmerica's Voice(link changed toAmerica's Voice (cable network)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KTUD-CD"}

The cemetery is now managed by three trusts. Rookwood Necropolis Land Manager are the custodians of Rookwood on behalf of the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]]. The two denominational trusts are responsible for the care and maintenance of a number of burial sections catering to various ethnic and cultural groups within the community. Those trusts are: Rookwood General Cemeteries Reserve Land Manager (Rookwood General Cemetery) and the Catholic Cemeteries and Crematoria. The NSW Cremation Company, which founded and operates The Rookwood Memorial Gardens Crematorium, is the oldest operating [[crematorium]] in Australia. The NSW Cremation Company is the only private company operating a 'cemetery' section within the Necropolis grounds. Today the company is part of the [[InvoCare]] company.\n\nRookwood also contains a number of memorial shrines including those dedicated to victims of the [[Holocaust]] and to members of the merchant marines killed in wartime. The Sydney War Cemetery is located in the eastern section of the Necropolis. The Circle of Love is a shrine dedicated to stillborn children or those who died in young infancy.\n\nThere are 915,000 people (figures as at 31 December 2014) that have been buried and cremated at Rookwood, which covers an area of {{convert|314|ha|acre|lk=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lpma.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/180631/Draft_Rookwood_Plan_of_Management_display_final_version_for_display_1_March_to_12_April_2013.PDF |title=Rookwood Necropolis Draft Plan of Management |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 2013 |page=23 |publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industry |accessdate=20 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808125401/http://www.lpma.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/180631/Draft_Rookwood_Plan_of_Management_display_final_version_for_display_1_March_to_12_April_2013.PDF |archive-date=8 August 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The \"Friends of Rookwood Inc\" is a voluntary organisation dedicated to preserving the site. As the largest [[Victorian era]] cemetery still in operation in the world, Rookwood is of significant national and historical importance.\n\nSome older sections of Rookwood are overgrown with a riot of plants, early horticultural plants, some now large trees or groves, as well as an interesting array of remnant indigenous flora. This results in quite an eclectic mix of flora to be found within the necropolis, including endangered native species such as [[Acacia pubescens|Downy wattle]] and small leaved [[Dillwynia]] (''Dillwynia parvifolia'').<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis, Wendy]] | title=Celebrating 150 years of Rookwood Catholic cemetery | page=139| publisher=Captain Honey | year=2017 | isbn=978-0-646-97289-3 }}</ref>\n\nThe Serpentine Canal within the Rookwood General Cemeteries Reserve Land Manager was restored in recent years, repairing and replacing ornamentation, landscaping and vegetation over {{convert|31|ha}} of the cemetery.\n\n==History==\nIn 1819, [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] [[Lachlan Macquarie]] established Sydney's main burial ground near the town's brickworks. By the 1840s, the [[Devonshire Street Cemetery]] was close to being full so another larger site was needed. A location on the Sydney Common was chosen in 1845, but abandoned in 1859 without ever being used due to complaints from local residents and churches.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sydney Cemeteries: A Field Guide|last=Murray|first=Lisa|publisher=NewSouth Publishing|year=2016|isbn=9781742234489|location=Sydney|pages=14\u201315, 50\u201354}}</ref> In Australia, as in Europe, there was an increasing trend to move burial sites outside of the cities for practical, hygienic and other more aesthetic purposes. With a [[Main Suburban railway line|railway line]] having been completed to [[Parramatta railway station|Parramatta]] in 1856, it was decided to locate the new cemetery at a point on the line. Several sites were surveyed and found to be inappropriate. However, in 1862 the government purchased 80 [[hectare]]s of land at Haslem's Creek from the estate of Edward Cohen. Cohen's land had previously formed part of a larger parcel known as \"Hyde Park\" that had been given to the magistrate and parliamentarian [[Henry Grattan Douglass]] in 1833 and subsequently leased out. The site was approved due to its relative isolation and proximity to the railway line.\n\nThe cemetery was then divided into sections for the various denominations according to their numbers in the 1861 census. The [[Church of England]] section was 21 hectares, the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic Church]] was allocated 14 hectares and a non-denominational area of 23 hectares was also established. Other denominations allocated land in the original 200 acres (80 hectares) were Jews, Independents (Congregationalists), Presbyterians and Wesleyans. The Necropolis Act of 1867 came into force on 1 January 1868 formally dedicating the cemetery and establishing cemetery trusts.<ref>{{Cite |url=https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/acts/1867-14a.pdf|title=The Necropolis Act of 1867|last=New South Wales Legislation|date=23 December 1867|access-date=29 May 2019}}</ref>  The first burial in the cemetery, reported by the ''Sydney Morning Herald,'' was a pauper, 18-year-old John Whalan, buried on 5 January 1867. This burial was not recorded in the burial register. The first official burial was recorded in the Roman Catholic area: a 14-month-old toddler, Catherine McMullen, on 7 January 1867.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sleeping City: The Story of Rookwood Necropolis|last=Weston|first=David A.|publisher=Society of Australian Genealogists and Hale & Iremonger|year=1989|isbn=0868064904|location=Sydney|pages=15}}</ref>\n\nBy 1879, more land was needed and the remaining 233 hectares of the former \"Hyde Park\" were then purchased. By the 1890s the cemetery was home to several buildings including the St Michael the Archangel Chapel and various cottages for section managers and [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]s.\n\nOriginally known simply as the [[wiktionary:necropolis|Necropolis]] (meaning \"city of the dead\"), local residents lobbied officials to have the name of their village changed from Haslem's Creek due to its association with the cemetery. In 1879, the villagers got their wish and the area's name was changed to Rookwood; however, before long, the Necropolis was also being referred to by that name. The settlement of Rookwood changed its name to [[Lidcombe, New South Wales|Lidcombe]], as a [[portmanteau]] of two mayors names, Lidbury and Larcombe (Larcombe was also a monumental [[stonemason]] whose business exists to this day) in 1913. The cemetery retained the name Rookwood.\n\nThe name Rookwood is most likely an accidental or deliberate corruption of the name [[Brookwood Cemetery]] and its associated [[Brookwood railway station|railway station]]. At the time of Rookwood's opening, Brookwood Cemetery, located in [[Brookwood, Surrey]], England, was one of the largest cemeteries in the world. It is less likely that, as claimed by some sources, Rookwood was named after [[William Harrison Ainsworth]]'s novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'', written in 1834.<ref name=\"station_names\" />\n\n==Railway line==\n{{main|Rookwood Cemetery railway line}}\n\n[[File:Rookwood 000016.jpg|thumb|200px|Haslem's Creek Cemetery station c.1865]]\nRookwood was served by a rail spur from the main line from 1867 until 1948. Mortuary stations served each of the three sections of the necropolis, with a fourth at the main junction and a fifth on [[Regent Street railway station|Regent Street]] adjacent to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]]. The railway line construction began in November 1864 and from 1 January 1865, trains began their run into the cemetery.  It stopped at prearranged stations on the journey from central Sydney in order to pick up mourners and coffins.  Trains ran at 9.30am and 3pm. The trains that carried the mourners were known as 'unimproved Redferns'<ref>Friends of Rookwood (2002) A Rookwood Ramble (book). A short self guided walking tour, NSW.</ref> There were two types of [[Hearse]] carriages used for the procession. One consisted of a four-wheeled van that carried up to 10 coffins on its upper and lower shelves. Each of these shelves was designed so it could open onto the platform. There were also eight-wheeled vans that could hold 30 coffins. Both of these vehicles were attached the back of the train for transporting to the cemetery. At the terminus inside the cemetery the coffins were unloaded using 'wheeled hand-propelled litters'<ref>Ochert, M.S. (1998) The Mortuary Station to Rookwood in Locality, 9 (2) pp.23-26.</ref>  The rail line was used to convey funeral parties to Rookwood until 1948 when the expanded use of processions by road made it obsolete. The stations were offered to the Joint Committee of Necropolis Trustees for the price of \u00a31 but due to maintenance costs the offer was rejected and the platforms within the cemetery were demolished.

The cemetery is now managed by three trusts. Rookwood Necropolis Land Manager are the custodians of Rookwood on behalf of the [[Government of New South Wales|NSW Government]]. The two denominational trusts are responsible for the care and maintenance of a number of burial sections catering to various ethnic and cultural groups within the community. Those trusts are: Rookwood General Cemeteries Reserve Land Manager (Rookwood General Cemetery) and the Catholic Cemeteries and Crematoria. The NSW Cremation Company, which founded and operates The Rookwood Memorial Gardens Crematorium, is the oldest operating [[crematorium]] in Australia. The NSW Cremation Company is the only private company operating a 'cemetery' section within the Necropolis grounds. Today the company is part of the [[InvoCare]] company.\n\nRookwood also contains a number of memorial shrines including those dedicated to victims of the [[Holocaust]] and to members of the merchant marines killed in wartime. The Sydney War Cemetery is located in the eastern section of the Necropolis. The Circle of Love is a shrine dedicated to stillborn children or those who died in young infancy.\n\nThere are 915,000 people (figures as at 31 December 2014) that have been buried and cremated at Rookwood, which covers an area of {{convert|314|ha|acre|lk=on}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lpma.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/180631/Draft_Rookwood_Plan_of_Management_display_final_version_for_display_1_March_to_12_April_2013.PDF |title=Rookwood Necropolis Draft Plan of Management |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 2013 |page=23 |publisher=NSW Department of Primary Industry |accessdate=20 July 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808125401/http://www.lpma.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0019/180631/Draft_Rookwood_Plan_of_Management_display_final_version_for_display_1_March_to_12_April_2013.PDF |archive-date=8 August 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The \"Friends of Rookwood Inc\" is a voluntary organisation dedicated to preserving the site. As the largest [[Victorian era]] cemetery still in operation in the world, Rookwood is of significant national and historical importance.\n\nSome older sections of Rookwood are overgrown with a riot of plants, early horticultural plants, some now large trees or groves, as well as an interesting array of remnant indigenous flora. This results in quite an eclectic mix of flora to be found within the necropolis, including endangered native species such as [[Acacia pubescens|Downy wattle]] and small leaved [[Dillwynia]] (''Dillwynia parvifolia'').<ref>{{cite book | author=[[Wendy Lewis|Lewis, Wendy]] | title=Celebrating 150 years of Rookwood Catholic cemetery | page=139| publisher=Captain Honey | year=2017 | isbn=978-0-646-97289-3 }}</ref>\n\nThe Serpentine Canal within the Rookwood General Cemeteries Reserve Land Manager was restored in recent years, repairing and replacing ornamentation, landscaping and vegetation over {{convert|31|ha}} of the cemetery.\n\n==History==\nIn 1819, [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]] [[Lachlan Macquarie]] established Sydney's main burial ground near the town's brickworks. By the 1840s, the [[Devonshire Street Cemetery]] was close to being full so another larger site was needed. A location on the Sydney Common was chosen in 1845, but abandoned in 1859 without ever being used due to complaints from local residents and churches.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sydney Cemeteries: A Field Guide|last=Murray|first=Lisa|publisher=NewSouth Publishing|year=2016|isbn=9781742234489|location=Sydney|pages=14\u201315, 50\u201354}}</ref> In Australia, as in Europe, there was an increasing trend to move burial sites outside of the cities for practical, hygienic and other more aesthetic purposes. With a [[Main Suburban railway line|railway line]] having been completed to [[Parramatta railway station|Parramatta]] in 1856, it was decided to locate the new cemetery at a point on the line. Several sites were surveyed and found to be inappropriate. However, in 1862 the government purchased 80 [[hectare]]s of land at Haslem's Creek from the estate of Edward Cohen. Cohen's land had previously formed part of a larger parcel known as \"Hyde Park\" that had been given to the magistrate and parliamentarian [[Henry Grattan Douglass]] in 1833 and subsequently leased out. The site was approved due to its relative isolation and proximity to the railway line.\n\nThe cemetery was then divided into sections for the various denominations according to their numbers in the 1861 census. The [[Church of England]] section was 21 hectares, the [[Roman Catholic|Catholic Church]] was allocated 14 hectares and a non-denominational area of 23 hectares was also established. Other denominations allocated land in the original 200 acres (80 hectares) were Jews, Independents (Congregationalists), Presbyterians and Wesleyans. The Necropolis Act of 1867 came into force on 1 January 1868 formally dedicating the cemetery and establishing cemetery trusts.<ref>{{Cite |url=https://legislation.nsw.gov.au/acts/1867-14a.pdf|title=The Necropolis Act of 1867|last=New South Wales Legislation|date=23 December 1867|access-date=29 May 2019}}</ref>  The first burial in the cemetery, reported by the ''Sydney Morning Herald,'' was a pauper, 18-year-old John Whalan, buried on 5 January 1867. This burial was not recorded in the burial register. The first official burial was recorded in the Roman Catholic area: a 14-month-old toddler, Catherine McMullen, on 7 January 1867.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Sleeping City: The Story of Rookwood Necropolis|last=Weston|first=David A.|publisher=Society of Australian Genealogists and Hale & Iremonger|year=1989|isbn=0868064904|location=Sydney|pages=15}}</ref>\n\nBy 1879, more land was needed and the remaining 233 hectares of the former \"Hyde Park\" were then purchased. By the 1890s the cemetery was home to several buildings including the St Michael the Archangel Chapel and various cottages for section managers and [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]s.\n\nOriginally known simply as the [[wiktionary:necropolis|Necropolis]] (meaning \"city of the dead\"), local residents lobbied officials to have the name of their village changed from Haslem's Creek due to its association with the cemetery. In 1879, the villagers got their wish and the area's name was changed to Rookwood; however, before long, the Necropolis was also being referred to by that name. The settlement of Rookwood changed its name to [[Lidcombe, New South Wales|Lidcombe]], as a [[portmanteau]] of two mayors names, Lidbury and Larcombe (Larcombe was also a monumental [[stonemason]] whose business exists to this day) in 1913. The cemetery retained the name Rookwood.\n\nThe name Rookwood is most likely an accidental or deliberate corruption of the name [[Brookwood Cemetery]] and its associated [[Brookwood railway station|railway station]]. At the time of Rookwood's opening, Brookwood Cemetery, located in [[Brookwood, Surrey]], England, was one of the largest cemeteries in the world. It is less likely that, as claimed by some sources, Rookwood was named after [[William Harrison Ainsworth]]'s novel ''[[Rookwood (novel)|Rookwood]]'', written in 1834.<ref name=\"station_names\" />\n\n==Railway line==\n{{main|Rookwood Cemetery railway line}}\n\n[[File:Rookwood 000016.jpg|thumb|200px|Haslem's Creek Cemetery station c.1865]]\nRookwood was served by a rail spur from the main line from 1867 until 1948. Mortuary stations served each of the three sections of the necropolis, with a fourth at the main junction and a fifth on [[Regent Street railway station|Regent Street]] adjacent to [[Central railway station, Sydney|Central station]]. The railway line construction began in November 1864 and from 1 January 1865, trains began their run into the cemetery.  It stopped at prearranged stations on the journey from central Sydney in order to pick up mourners and coffins.  Trains ran at 9.30am and 3pm. The trains that carried the mourners were known as 'unimproved Redferns'<ref>Friends of Rookwood (2002) A Rookwood Ramble (book). A short self guided walking tour, NSW.</ref> There were two types of [[Hearse]] carriages used for the procession. One consisted of a four-wheeled van that carried up to 10 coffins on its upper and lower shelves. Each of these shelves was designed so it could open onto the platform. There were also eight-wheeled vans that could hold 30 coffins. Both of these vehicles were attached the back of the train for transporting to the cemetery. At the terminus inside the cemetery the coffins were unloaded using 'wheeled hand-propelled litters'<ref>Ochert, M.S. (1998) The Mortuary Station to Rookwood in Locality, 9 (2) pp.23-26.</ref>  The rail line was used to convey funeral parties to Rookwood until 1948 when the expanded use of processions by road made it obsolete. The stations were offered to the Joint Committee of Necropolis Trustees for the price of \u00a31 but due to maintenance costs the offer was rejected and the platforms within the cemetery were demolished.
