It stars Tyler Perry as [[Madea (Mabel Simmons)|Mabel \"Madea\" Simmons]], [[Cassi Davis]] as Ella, Cherly Pepsi Riley as Wanda, and Judy Peterson as Katie.\n\n==Plot==\nThe play opens on Vanessa, an aspiring business student whose stress over school (and natural disposition) leads her to be tempestuous towards the people who come and go throughout the scene. Her husband is Sonny Andrews, the child of Madea's deceased sister, Irene. He enters looking for his work shirt, as he is on his way to the prison to work one of many long shifts to pay for Vanessa's schooling and support their child, who is never seen but in the bedroom upstairs. Vanessa refuses to help him, insisting on completing her studying. Ella Kincaid, Madea's best friend and next door neighbor, enters the house asking for Madea (Tyler Perry), who is absent. Unbeknownst to the rest, Madea has been arrested in Conyers for refusing to pay for gas for her car, and is currently in custody at the prison where Sonny works. Ella notices Vanessa's ambivalence over her husband's dilemma, and chastises her for her negligence as a wife and mother, insisting that a real woman takes care of her man, cooks him breakfast, irons his clothes, and doesn't trifle with school, though Vanessa's counter to this is to remind Ella of her current single relationship status. Nate, Sonny's Jamaican boss and friend, comes to the house to drive Sonny to work, and remains in the living room for Ella to ogle while Sonny tries to placate his flustered wife upstairs, promising her some loving and affection after he returns from work. He leaves with Nate. Ella receives a phone call at Madea's house with information that Madea is in jail, and the scene cuts.\n\nMeanwhile, at the jail, we see Sonny getting ready for work where he sees long-time friend, Wanda, who is now the head Defense Attorney at the prison. After a brief conversation, Wanda leaves and Leo explained that all the ladies, except Madea, were all calm. Madea, later, came in the jail after being left in the yard and tells Sonny that Leo was trying to rape her. She tells Sonny about the Conyers incident, and asks Sonny to go home for the bail money. She later meets Chico, a young woman with 3 boys (one in jail, one \"strung out\", and one dead) and Katie (Judy Peterson) who has been in jail for nine years for stabbing her ex-husband (Ron Andrews), a pimp that tried to hurt his and Katie's daughter (Anndretta Lyle), but now that she's in jail, her daughter has been continuously jumping from foster home to foster home. Katie's daughter, Toni, comes to visit and is shown to have a nasty attitude and when she gets one with Madea, she stabs her with her cigarette. Later, we see Jeremy and Katie's ex-husband, Pete the Pimp. After bail is made for Madea, and a brief encounter with Pete, she decides to take care of Toni until Katie gets out of jail.\n\nOnce Madea is back at home, she notices a strange perfume on the clothes she washed, believing Vanessa was responsible. Ella stops by  asks about Toni and Madea reveals she has been disobedient. Madea gave Toni Cora's old dresses to wear for school, but Toni wears a mini skirt, red boots, a pink top and jacket. Madea becomes annoyed when Toni starts ignoring her and Ella. Toni has an attitude toward Madea and Ella and after receiving a spanking with one of Madea's belts, she is forced to go back upstairs and change. Leo and Sonny arrive, and Leo leaves with Ella, while Sonny receives his food and leaves with Madea and Toni.\n\nSonny forgets his keys and has to return home to pick them up but the frantic Vanessa tries to get him to leave quickly, due to Nate being upstairs in the bedroom. Sonny then leaves and Nate and Vanessa start to kiss but the baby is in the tub, Vanessa tells Nate he`s fine but Nate hears water running and they both run into the bathroom.\n\nThe next scene starts with Madea upset that Vanessa let that happen to the baby, Then when Vanessa, Sonny, and Nate come in from the emergency room, Madea smells the same thing on Nate that was on Vanessa clothes. Ella and Madea realize that and when it's revealed to be Kente Oil, Madea soon tells Vanessa that she is sleeping with Nate. Soon Wanda comes in and tells him that Sonny isn't the father of that child, then everybody gets angry then, after a brief confrontation, everyone leaves and Wanda sings her number.\n\nThe next day, Sonny, Toni, and Wanda come back from church, and Sonny says he'll go back to work, to take his mind off the incident. During this, it is revealed that Nate wasn't the father of the baby either, and that Vanessa was charged with child endangerment. After learning that Vanessa gave up her parental rights, and that the baby will be given to foster care, Sonny expresses his desire to adopt and raise the child. Ella and Leo arrive, and then sing a number with Sonny and Wanda.\n\nThe next scene starts with Vanessa in jail, shouting to request a phone call when Leo (and later, Sonny) arrives. Vanessa attempts to weasel her way back into Sonny's graces, due to her job interview (she will lose the job if not out by Monday). She signs the divorce papers and accidentally calls Sonny, \"Nate\". Sonny meets with Jeremy, and Nate arrives, and after brushing off Vanessa out of anger and disgust, gives Sonny more jobs (working four back to back doubles). Jeremy intervenes and decides to help Sonny by talking to the warden. He also schedules Toni to pay a visit to Katie. Also, Katie convinces Chico to turn her life over to God, which she does, in hopes to find a brand new life (which someday, she will). \n\nThe next day, Nate arrives and almost ends up in another confrontation with Sonny, before Leo breaks it up. Jeremy then reveals that he had a conversation with the Warden, saying that another officer was needed at the F-Unit. Nate takes the position and finds out that Sonny has his job now, at which point he leaves. Leo becomes jealous that Sonny is now his boss and denounces his friendship with Sonny. Wanda arrives and Sonny talks with her about her relationship status. He then reveals his love for Wanda, and she is initially unsure of her emotions, but leaves with Sonny. Ella arrives and forces Leo to apologize to Sonny. Madea arrives with Toni to talk to Katie, while Ella, Sonny and Wanda leave. When Katie is properly greeted by her daughter, she is pleased with the change. Madea then persuades Katie to tell Toni the truth about everything, and subsequently exits. Katie prepares to tell her daughter the truth, but Toni does not believe her and runs out of the jail.\n\nThe scene cuts to Sonny singing his number, before being joined in by Madea, and Toni doing her homework. Sonny is clearly brooding over his breakup with Vanessa, and mentions to Madea, that he tried to change her but Madea says that it is a waste of time. When he reveals that he did not see this coming, Madea does not believe him and instructs him to start paying attention to his head. She also instructs him to move on from this experience. After some more pep talk, Ella, Wanda, Leo, and Jeremy arrive and soon everyone (bar Toni and Sonny) sings their numbers, to try and cheer Sonny up.\n\nAfter this, it is revealed by Wanda that Leo is in fact, the father of Vanessa's baby, which leads to him running out of the house quickly and Ella, livid of the news, exiting as well. She pursues Leo with a knife in her hand. This proves that Leo was no more of a friend to Sonny than Nate was. It seems that Sonny and Wanda are becoming a couple as they share a kiss right before Madea goes upstairs to Toni's room.\n\nToni is on the phone with a  16-year-old boy named \"Lil Wilson\"  and hangs when Madea enters. Madea picks up the receiver and after learning about how young all of his family gets pregnant, she advises her not to talk to him anymore. She spends the rest of her time with Toni giving her advice about being what she wants to be, not caring about others' opinions of her, as well as giving Toni her interpretations of the Bible, when Toni reveals that she doesn't know how to pray. After leaving the room, she asks Jeremy to teach her about prayer. (Jeremy sing his number at this point)\n\nThe next day, Toni is confronted by her father, but Madea and Ella arrive just in time to save her and chase out. Wanda, Sonny, and the released Katie enter the house. After the revelation is made that Katie is ready to take Toni back, Toni wants to stay with Madea, but she insists. Madea leaves, and Toni is still unsure of what to feel, until Katie sings her number. Toni gathers her things, says goodbye to Ella, Sonny, and Wanda and leaves with her mother. And with that Sonny and Wanda are married and Toni leaves with her mother.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tyler Perry]] as Mabel \"Madea\" Simmons\n* [[Christian Keyes]] as Sonny Andrews\n* [[Cassi Davis]] as Ella Kincaid\n* [[Lavan Davis]] as Leo\n* [[Cheryl Pepsii Riley]] as Wanda Simmons-Andrews\n* Judy Peterson as Katie\n* Chantell Christopher as Vanessa Andrews\n* Brian Hurst as Jeremy Tucker\n* Anndretta Lyle as Toni\n* Ryan Gentles as Nate\n* Ron Andrews as Pete\n* Crystal \"Crissy\" Collins as Chico\n\n==Musical numbers==\n# \"How Does That Feel?\" \u2013 Ella\n# \"Wait Till I Get Home Tonight\" \u2013 Sonny\n# \"Down on My Luck\" \u2013 Ella, Katie, Madea, Leo and Chico\n# \"We Need a Word\" \u2013 Wanda\n# \"Whaddaya Know About Jesus?\" \u2013 Ella, Wanda, Leo and Sonny\n# \"Jesus Loves Me\" \u2013 Chico and Katie\n# \"[[Ain't No Sunshine]]\" \u2013 Sonny and Madea\n# \"Give It to Me Too\" \u2013 Madea\n# \"It Takes a Fool\" \u2013 Madea\n# \"Makin' It Easy\" \u2013 Ella\n# \"Sweet Love\" \u2013 Wanda\n# \"[[Let's Get It On]]\" \u2013 Leo\n# \"[[Before I Let Go]]\" \u2013 Jeremy\n# \"His Name Is Jesus\" \u2013 Jeremy\n# \"I Want to Be Free\" \u2013 Katie\n\n==Film adaptation==\nA [[film adaptation]] of [[Madea Goes to Jail|the same name]] was released on February 20, 2009.\n\n==Past productions==\n\n* [[Cheryl Pepsii Riley]] starred in numerous Tyler Perry plays and the film ''[[Diary of a Mad Black Woman]]''.\n* [[Cassi Davis]] was in ''[[Daddy's Little Girls]]'' and currently is in the sitcom ''[[Tyler Perry's House of Payne]]\n\n==External links==\n* {{official website|http://www.tylerperry.com/stage-plays/madea-goes-jail/}}\n\n{{Tyler Perry}}\n\n[[Category:Plays by Tyler Perry]]\n[[Category:African-American plays]]\n[[Category:American plays adapted into films]]\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=January 2014}}\n{{Infobox play\n| name       = Madea Goes to Jail\n| image      =\n| image_size = \n| image_alt  = \n| caption    = \n| writer     = [[Tyler Perry]] \n| directed   = [[Tyler Perry]]\n| characters = [[Mabel Simmons|Madea]], Ella, Sonny, and Katie\n| mute       = \n| setting    = Madea's house; County Jail\n| premiere   = <!-- {{Start date|YYYY|MM|DD}} -->\n| place      = \n| orig_lang  = \n| series     = \n| subject    = \n| genre      = Comedy-Drama\n| web        = {{official website|http://www.tylerperry.com/stage-plays/madea-goes-jail/}}\n| preceded_by   = [[Meet the Browns (play)|Meet the Browns]]\n| followed_by  = [[What's Done in the Dark]]\n}}\n'''''Madea Goes to Jail''''' is an American [[Musical theatre|musical]] play, touring from 2005 to 2006, created, written, produced, and directed by [[Tyler Perry]].

Some say that the first settlement was called San Juanico in Bacod Island from which the name San Juanico strait was derived. Another version says that the first settlement was San Vicente, which was part of [[Bacod Island]], while still others say that the first municipal site was in the present barangay of Malibago. The most favored version, however, is that Babatngon and Malibago existed as separate settlements along the San Juanico strait during the 17th century and then in the process of growth, Babatngon became a municipality earlier than the other settlements.\n\nAnother version claims that Babatngon was founded as an outpost. This version may be proven by the presence of two \"''baluartes''\" or [[watchtowers]] at [[Bijuco]] and Magsaigad.\n\n===Settlement===\n\nBabatngon was first settled in 1540 by natives of [[Carigara, Leyte|Carigara]], [[Catbalogan]] (Samar) and migrants from [[Bohol]]. The Boholanos traded mats, abac\u00e1 cloths, bolos and other goods. One day, near the end of the year 1600, the Boholano traders were stranded in the present site of Babatngon because of unfavorable winds. The town at the time was covered by thick forests from the shore to the uplands with undergrowth of pandans and guava trees. Greatly in need of food, they hunted for wild animals and found wild game to be rich. Inspired by their first abundant catch, they went home and told their home folks about the rich hunting ground. Encouraged by the news and inspired by their desire to settle in fertile lands which they can call their own, many Boholanos came equipped with large traps called \"batong\" made of [[abac\u00e1]] fibers.\n\nFrom \"batong\", the place was called \"Babatngon\" - hunting ground with the use of a net. The early [[Spaniards]] called the town \"Babagnon\" but the natives changed the original name into \"Babatngon\" for easier diction.\n\n===Colonial Period===\n\nThe [[conquistadors]]' first concern was [[religion]], thus it was Fr. Juan Quimbo who constructed the first church. At the turn of the century, the [[friar]]s turned over the parish to the secular priests. Remembered for the contributions to the parish are:\n\nFr. Masecampo who established the first \"campo santo\" which has lived to the present; Fr. F. Langteco who reconstructed the church after it was destroyed by [[typhoon]]s; Fr. A Colasito who constructed the belfry; Fr. F. Rostata who began the reconstruction of the church after the war; and finally, Fr. A. Alve to whom belongs the distinction of giving Babatngon Church the finishing touches. Fr. Alve was also responsible for constructing the first convent.\n\nToday there are ten religious organizations all dedicated to [[St. Vincent Ferrer]], Babatngon's patron saint. According to a census, out of a population of 12,000 inhabitants, only 98 are non-Catholics.\n\n===Expansion===\n\nThe expansion of the town was sparked by the establishment of a [[United Kingdom|British]] trading post - called \"[[Almacen]]\" in [[Soledad street]]. Soon after the trading post was organized, huge brick and adobe commercial houses were constructed across the street. The trade name of the establishment was [[Smith Bell]].\n\nImmigrants from [[Japan]], [[Carigara, Leyte|Carigara]], [[Barugo, Leyte|Barugo]], San Miguel and from the coastal towns of Western Samar and other countries flocked to Babatngon which had grown into a commercial district.\n\nFarming and fishing became the chief industries of the new and thriving town. Rice, corn, abac\u00e1 and coconuts grew in abundance. The manufacture of wooden sandals (bakya) inevitably developed from the presence of an almost inexhaustible source of soft wood, the material from which sandals are patiently carved. The sandals have reached far and wide and have found a market even in Surigao.\n\n===Revolutionary Period===\n\nIn 1901, when the uprising rocked the entire archipelago from end to end, a band of revolucionarios led by Domingo Inbrua fought openly with the guardias civiles and caused havoc in the garrisons of Carigara and Barugo. The revolucionarios, armed with bolos and other crude weapons struck fear in the hearts of their better-trained armed adversaries.\n\nHowever, Babatngon had its share of misfortune. The stone buildings were ruined when the Spaniards made their last stand during the revolution within the town proper. No sooner had the people recovered from the devastation when another war razed the school building, the town hall, recreational centers and countless residential houses to the ground.\n\n===WW II and Japanese Occupation===\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Mayor Melchor Ca\u00f1ete guided the townspeople through the difficulties of food shortage and unsettled times. Mayor Ca\u00f1ete kept the peace in Babatngon so well during the [[Japan]]ese occupation that the seat of provincial government was temporarily transferred to the town. Moreover, Many evacuees found refuge in the town from the dangers of their own municipalities.\n\nIn 1944 to 1945, an attack by combined American and the Philippine Commonwealth troops took the town of Babatngon, Leyte.\n\n===Today===\n\nBanditry created a ripple of unrest in Babatngon's history for a time. Bandit lairs in Poro, Kalangawan Island, and Toyong on Kalkagan Island hid two of the fiercest leaders of organized piracy. Punitive forces under the leadership of Capitan Cecilio Serrano raided the bandits' lair and in a hand-to-hand encounter succeeded in killing the two bandits and many of their followers. The imprisonment of the bandits and the death of their leaders disorganized the others so that again, peace came to the town.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Babatngon\n| 1903 = 5159\n| 1918 = 4716\n| 1939 = 8000\n| 1948 = 9992\n| 1960 = 11476\n| 1970 = 14927\n| 1975 = 16316\n| 1980 = 16449\n| 1990 = 17795\n| 1995 = 19653\n| 2000 = 20946\n| 2007 = 24067\n| 2010 = 25575\n| 2015 = 27797\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Babatngon, Leyte, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==Attractions==\n\nBabatngon is known for [[Busay Falls]], a three-tiered cataract which is an attraction for picnickers who flock to Babatngon during the summer months.

It is {{convert|33|km}} north-west of Tacloban City and about {{convert|10|km}} north of the town of [[San Miguel, Leyte|San Miguel]]. Small coconut covered islets fringe its coast along San Juanico Strait, the most important of which are Rizal, Magsaigad, Tabigue, almost all of which extend from east to west.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Geography==\n===Barangays===\n\nBabatngon is politically subdivided into 25 [[barangay]]s.{{PSGC detail|area}} In 1957, sitios Biasong, Lube, Ubayan, Calcagan, Cancamaoy, and Opong was constituted into barrio Biasong while sitio Nababoy was converted into barrio San Ricardo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1732.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120712014748/http://lawph.com/statutes/ra1732.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-07-12 |title=An Act Creating Certain Barrios in the Municipality of Babatngon, Province of Leyte |publisher=LawPH.com |accessdate=2011-04-12 }}</ref>\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* Bacong\n* Bagong Silang\n* Biasong\n* Guintigui-an\n* Gov.

Some say that the first settlement was called San Juanico in Bacod Island from which the name San Juanico strait was derived. Another version says that the first settlement was San Vicente, which was part of [[Bacod Island]], while still others say that the first municipal site was in the present barangay of Malibago. The most favored version, however, is that Babatngon and Malibago existed as separate settlements along the San Juanico strait during the 17th century and then in the process of growth, Babatngon became a municipality earlier than the other settlements.\n\nAnother version claims that Babatngon was founded as an outpost. This version may be proven by the presence of two \"''baluartes''\" or [[watchtowers]] at [[Bijuco]] and Magsaigad.\n\n===Settlement===\n\nBabatngon was first settled in 1540 by natives of [[Carigara, Leyte|Carigara]], [[Catbalogan]] (Samar) and migrants from [[Bohol]]. The Boholanos traded mats, abac\u00e1 cloths, bolos and other goods. One day, near the end of the year 1600, the Boholano traders were stranded in the present site of Babatngon because of unfavorable winds. The town at the time was covered by thick forests from the shore to the uplands with undergrowth of pandans and guava trees. Greatly in need of food, they hunted for wild animals and found wild game to be rich. Inspired by their first abundant catch, they went home and told their home folks about the rich hunting ground. Encouraged by the news and inspired by their desire to settle in fertile lands which they can call their own, many Boholanos came equipped with large traps called \"batong\" made of [[abac\u00e1]] fibers.\n\nFrom \"batong\", the place was called \"Babatngon\" - hunting ground with the use of a net. The early [[Spaniards]] called the town \"Babagnon\" but the natives changed the original name into \"Babatngon\" for easier diction.\n\n===Colonial Period===\n\nThe [[conquistadors]]' first concern was [[religion]], thus it was Fr. Juan Quimbo who constructed the first church. At the turn of the century, the [[friar]]s turned over the parish to the secular priests. Remembered for the contributions to the parish are:\n\nFr. Masecampo who established the first \"campo santo\" which has lived to the present; Fr. F. Langteco who reconstructed the church after it was destroyed by [[typhoon]]s; Fr. A Colasito who constructed the belfry; Fr. F. Rostata who began the reconstruction of the church after the war; and finally, Fr. A. Alve to whom belongs the distinction of giving Babatngon Church the finishing touches. Fr. Alve was also responsible for constructing the first convent.\n\nToday there are ten religious organizations all dedicated to [[St. Vincent Ferrer]], Babatngon's patron saint. According to a census, out of a population of 12,000 inhabitants, only 98 are non-Catholics.\n\n===Expansion===\n\nThe expansion of the town was sparked by the establishment of a [[United Kingdom|British]] trading post - called \"[[Almacen]]\" in [[Soledad street]]. Soon after the trading post was organized, huge brick and adobe commercial houses were constructed across the street. The trade name of the establishment was [[Smith Bell]].\n\nImmigrants from [[Japan]], [[Carigara, Leyte|Carigara]], [[Barugo, Leyte|Barugo]], San Miguel and from the coastal towns of Western Samar and other countries flocked to Babatngon which had grown into a commercial district.\n\nFarming and fishing became the chief industries of the new and thriving town. Rice, corn, abac\u00e1 and coconuts grew in abundance. The manufacture of wooden sandals (bakya) inevitably developed from the presence of an almost inexhaustible source of soft wood, the material from which sandals are patiently carved. The sandals have reached far and wide and have found a market even in Surigao.\n\n===Revolutionary Period===\n\nIn 1901, when the uprising rocked the entire archipelago from end to end, a band of revolucionarios led by Domingo Inbrua fought openly with the guardias civiles and caused havoc in the garrisons of Carigara and Barugo. The revolucionarios, armed with bolos and other crude weapons struck fear in the hearts of their better-trained armed adversaries.\n\nHowever, Babatngon had its share of misfortune. The stone buildings were ruined when the Spaniards made their last stand during the revolution within the town proper. No sooner had the people recovered from the devastation when another war razed the school building, the town hall, recreational centers and countless residential houses to the ground.\n\n===WW II and Japanese Occupation===\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], Mayor Melchor Ca\u00f1ete guided the townspeople through the difficulties of food shortage and unsettled times. Mayor Ca\u00f1ete kept the peace in Babatngon so well during the [[Japan]]ese occupation that the seat of provincial government was temporarily transferred to the town. Moreover, Many evacuees found refuge in the town from the dangers of their own municipalities.\n\nIn 1944 to 1945, an attack by combined American and the Philippine Commonwealth troops took the town of Babatngon, Leyte.\n\n===Today===\n\nBanditry created a ripple of unrest in Babatngon's history for a time. Bandit lairs in Poro, Kalangawan Island, and Toyong on Kalkagan Island hid two of the fiercest leaders of organized piracy. Punitive forces under the leadership of Capitan Cecilio Serrano raided the bandits' lair and in a hand-to-hand encounter succeeded in killing the two bandits and many of their followers. The imprisonment of the bandits and the death of their leaders disorganized the others so that again, peace came to the town.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Babatngon\n| 1903 = 5159\n| 1918 = 4716\n| 1939 = 8000\n| 1948 = 9992\n| 1960 = 11476\n| 1970 = 14927\n| 1975 = 16316\n| 1980 = 16449\n| 1990 = 17795\n| 1995 = 19653\n| 2000 = 20946\n| 2007 = 24067\n| 2010 = 25575\n| 2015 = 27797\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}} \n}}\n\nIn the {{PH wikidata|population_as_of}}, the population of Babatngon, Leyte, was {{PH wikidata|population_total}} people,{{PH census|current}} with a density of {{convert|{{sigfig|{{PH wikidata|population_total}}/{{PH wikidata|area}}|2}}|PD/km2|disp=or}}.\n\n==Attractions==\n\nBabatngon is known for [[Busay Falls]], a three-tiered cataract which is an attraction for picnickers who flock to Babatngon during the summer months.

In the series, which is set on the planet Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of [[Fictional currency|$$]]60 billion (\"double dollar\") and the nickname {{nihongo|\"The Humanoid Typhoon\"|\u4eba\u9593\u53f0\u98a8}} after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. He is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters as well as assassins working for his twin brother, [[Millions Knives]]. Despite his reputation, Vash displays a kindhearted personality by refusing to murder his enemies and by befriending civilians.  \n\nNightow created Vash as a strong gunner who would stand out because of his [[pacifist]] ways, traits that are different from those of the stereotypical protagonist of action films. Vash's designs primarily feature a red coat and blond hair. The manga was adapted for television as an [[anime]] series in which Vash was voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]] as an adult and [[K\u014dki Miyata]] as a child. For the English dub, [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] voices him as an adult and [[Bryce Papenbrook]] as a child. The character also appears in the 2010 film ''[[Trigun: Badlands Rumble]]'' among other [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity with Western audiences. \n\nCritics praised the mixture of seriousness and goofiness of Vash's character. However, his pacifism received a more mixed response; while some reviewers praised it as a part of Vash's heroic traits, others disliked the negative consequences when his pacifist choices failed. He remained popular in the anime adaptation, and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles. Onosaka and Bosch were praised for their performances, though critics favored Onosaka.\n\n== Concept and creation ==\n[[File:Yasuhiro Nightow 20110630 Japan Expo 1.jpg|thumb|left|Yasuhiro Nightow created Vash the Stampede.|alt=A black haired Japanese man wearing glasses.]]\n\nVash was created by ''[[Trigun]]'' [[manga]] author [[Yasuhiro Nightow]],<ref name=\"dark\">{{cite web |url=http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1309/Gunning-for-Answers-An-Interview-with-Trigun-creator-Yasuhiro-Nightow-5-26-06 |title=Dark Horse Interview |publisher=[[Dark Horse Comics]]|date=March 30, 2012 |accessdate=March 30, 2012|url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131011185649/http://www.darkhorse.com/Interviews/1309/Gunning-for-Answers-An-Interview-with-Trigun-creator-Yasuhiro-Nightow-5-26-06 |archivedate=October 1, 2013 }}</ref> who created his name on his own in contrast to other character names are references to companies.<ref name=\"name\">{{cite web |url=http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |title=Anime Expo 2009 |publisher=[[Anime Expo]] |date=2012-03-29 |accessdate=March 29, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927150426/http://www.neoseeker.com/Articles/Hardware/Features/AX_09/5.html |archivedate=September 27, 2013 }}</ref> Nightow made the character a pacifist because he aimed not to have Vash be a murderer, something typical in action films.

In the gun's original design, there was no way of opening it to insert bullets so Nightow instead used a picture of an upside-down [[Gun barrel|barrel]] as inspiration. Nightow found visual appearance the odd guns that came in later episodes difficult, and the idea of \"baka guns\"\u2014weapons that fire unlimited magical bullets\u2014slowly disappeared.

In the series, which is set on the planet Gunsmoke, Vash is the most feared outlaw who has earned a bounty of [[Fictional currency|$$]]60 billion (\"double dollar\") and the nickname {{nihongo|\"The Humanoid Typhoon\"|\u4eba\u9593\u53f0\u98a8}} after accidentally destroying a city with his supernatural powers. He is a skilled gunman who battles bounty hunters as well as assassins working for his twin brother, [[Millions Knives]]. Despite his reputation, Vash displays a kindhearted personality by refusing to murder his enemies and by befriending civilians.  \n\nNightow created Vash as a strong gunner who would stand out because of his [[pacifist]] ways, traits that are different from those of the stereotypical protagonist of action films. Vash's designs primarily feature a red coat and blond hair. The manga was adapted for television as an [[anime]] series in which Vash was voiced by [[Masaya Onosaka]] as an adult and [[K\u014dki Miyata]] as a child. For the English dub, [[Johnny Yong Bosch]] voices him as an adult and [[Bryce Papenbrook]] as a child. The character also appears in the 2010 film ''[[Trigun: Badlands Rumble]]'' among other [[One-shot (comics)|one-shots]]. Nightow was surprised at Vash's popularity with Western audiences. \n\nCritics praised the mixture of seriousness and goofiness of Vash's character. However, his pacifism received a more mixed response; while some reviewers praised it as a part of Vash's heroic traits, others disliked the negative consequences when his pacifist choices failed. He remained popular in the anime adaptation, and has appeared in multiple \"best character\" lists and articles.
