stemming from the [[1966 World Cup]] and intensified by the [[Falklands War]] of 1982, Argentina and [[England national football team|England]] have had numerous confrontations in World Cup

The first was a handball, but was ruled legal by the referee. The second, scored minutes later, saw Maradona passing five England outfield players before scoring, and is often described as one of the greatest goals in football history.\n\nThe nations were paired together in the Round of 16 at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], won by Argentina on penalties, and again at the group stage in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], England winning 1\u20130 through a penalty by [[David Beckham]] who had been sent off in the tie four years earlier.\n\n[[File:Germany and Argentina face off in the final of the World Cup 2014 -2014-07-13 (29).jpg|thumb|Action from the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]] between Argentina and [[Germany national football team|Germany]]]]\n\n===Germany===\nArgentina have played [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in seven FIFA World Cup matches including three [[FIFA World Cup]] finals: In [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|1986]] Argentina won 3\u20132, but in [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|1990]] it was the Germans who were the victors by a 1\u20130 scoreline.\n\nIn [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] they met for the first time in the group stage, where Argentina suffered a 1-3 loss to [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|defending champions]] West Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=220/match=1323/live-blog.html|title=1958 FIFA World Cup Sweden \u2122 - Matches|last=FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref> In [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] both again faced each other in the group stage which ended in a scoreless draw.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesoccerworldcups.com/head_to_head/argentina_vs_germany.php|title=Argentina vs. Germany Head-to-Head in the World Cups|website=www.thesoccerworldcups.com|access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref> 2006 they met in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Germany vs Argentina|quarter-finals]]; Argentina lost on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw.

stemming from the [[1966 World Cup]] and intensified by the [[Falklands War]] of 1982, Argentina and [[England national football team|England]] have had numerous confrontations in World Cup

The first was a handball, but was ruled legal by the referee. The second, scored minutes later, saw Maradona passing five England outfield players before scoring, and is often described as one of the greatest goals in football history.\n\nThe nations were paired together in the Round of 16 at the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], won by Argentina on penalties, and again at the group stage in [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]], England winning 1\u20130 through a penalty by [[David Beckham]] who had been sent off in the tie four years earlier.\n\n[[File:Germany and Argentina face off in the final of the World Cup 2014 -2014-07-13 (29).jpg|thumb|Action from the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final]] between Argentina and [[Germany national football team|Germany]]]]\n\n===Germany===\nArgentina have played [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in seven FIFA World Cup matches including three [[FIFA World Cup]] finals: In [[1986 FIFA World Cup Final|1986]] Argentina won 3\u20132, but in [[1990 FIFA World Cup Final|1990]] it was the Germans who were the victors by a 1\u20130 scoreline.\n\nIn [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]] they met for the first time in the group stage, where Argentina suffered a 1-3 loss to [[1954 FIFA World Cup Final|defending champions]] West Germany.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=220/match=1323/live-blog.html|title=1958 FIFA World Cup Sweden \u2122 - Matches|last=FIFA.com|website=FIFA.com|language=en|access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref> In [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]] both again faced each other in the group stage which ended in a scoreless draw.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesoccerworldcups.com/head_to_head/argentina_vs_germany.php|title=Argentina vs. Germany Head-to-Head in the World Cups|website=www.thesoccerworldcups.com|access-date=2019-05-22}}</ref> 2006 they met in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Germany vs Argentina|quarter-finals]]; Argentina lost on penalties after a 1\u20131 draw.

In Majha dialect of Punjabi language, the sound ''L'' become ''N'', such as ''langhna'' (pass) and ''nambardar'' (percentage revenue holder) become ''naghna'' and ''lambardar'' respectively.<ref name=lambardar>[https://books.google.com/books?id=gZkKAQAAIAAJ&q=lambardar+versus+nambardar+which+one+is+the+legal+term&dq=lambardar+versus+nambardar+which+one+is+the+legal+term&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjeh62h2uzUAhWLKo8KHXAJBL4Q6AEIIDAA Punjab District Gazetteers: Firozpur], pp.135.]</ref> The term ''lambardar'' is used in the land revenue acts of Jammu and Kashmir state of India and West Punjab (Pakistan) and Pakistan.<ref name=lam1>[>https://books.google.com/books?id=P1NYAAAAMAAJ&q=lambardar+law+act&dq=lambardar+law+act&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj-pdTj7-zUAhWLpo8KHaBTC0kQ6AEIQzAJ The Revenue Rulings (Punjab & West Pakistan): 1960-1966], Musht\u0101q A\u1e25mad (LL.

During drought and famine they frequently abandoned the land and moved to other places. Hence, the land ownership was not a permanent concept. They were taxed by the rulers of the day based on the number of the cattle and area of the land cultivated. After the famine of 1783, many cultivators abandoned the villages and migrated elsewhere, and some land was sold by the owners. Slowly prominent farmers came into the possession of large lands, and they acquired the status of proprietors of the village estate and were recorded as such during the settlement of 1840-41 by the [[British Raj]]. These estates came to be known as zamindari or pattidari tenures, most influential and the largest estate-holders among them in due time became zaildars and lambardars. The British even used them as a localised dispute ombudsman and gave these big zamindars some moral policing rights. During the settlement of 1840-41, the tenants were classified into three classes: (a) those who had held land continuously for many years at a fixed rent and were not liable to ejectment, (b) the tenants in ''bhaiachara'' (brotherhood) villages who paid rent at the same rate as the members of brotherhood and who so long as they paid this rate were never ejected, (c) and those who cultivated from year to year under fresh agreement. These tenancies were further  classified  during 1863 settlement and a definite status was fixed on different classes of tenants. The ordinary division into tenants with or without right of occupancy was  adopted. Thus, the concept of the formal permanent ownership of the land came into being, and became a legalized and formally documented.<ref name=gaz1/>\n\n==India==\n=== The Land Revenue System ===\nEach  estate  is  represented  by  one  or more lambardars in  its  dealings  with  the government. Estates are grouped into patwar circles under the charge of a [[Patwari]], while 15 to 20 circles form the charge of a Kanungo, whose duty is to supervise the work of Patwaris. An estate is the unit of land revenue administration for the collection of tax. Each estate is usually equal to a village. Each estate is individually assessed by a [[Patwari]] and its record of rights and register of fiscal and agricultural statistics maintained separately. All the proprietors are by law jointly responsible for payment of land  revenue.\n\n=== Land Reforms of India ===\nAfter India's independence in 1947, government enacted several land reforms such as the assessment of permissible area in relation to a family instead of an individual, and reduced the permissible area to the set limit (e.g. to 7.25 hectares in Punjab) of land under assured irrigation capable of growing at least 1 crop in a year or 21.8 hectares in respect of any other land including banjar and land under orchards. In addition to legally capping the amount land holding by the government, the voluntary [[Bhoodan movement]] of 1950s and 60s also led to the donation of the land ownership from rich owners to the landless tenants. Government also undertook aggressive land consolidation and standardization of ''killa'' (agricultural plots of one acre each).\n\n===Legal description===\nIn India, each state has its own land acts governing the system of Nambardari. Following acts are applicable to the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Haryana]] [[Himachal Pradesh]] [[Delhi]] [[Rajisthan]] [[Madhya Pradesh]].\n\n====The Land Holdings Tax Act, 1973 ====\nBefore the ''Land Holdings Tax Act, 1973'', was enacted, the lambardar was paid \n''pachhotra'' (commission) at the rate of 5 per cent of land revenue.  In this act various levies  were  consolidated  into  land  holdings  tax and lambardars' share was fixed at 3 per cent of the new tax revenue.<ref name=gaz1/>\n\n==== Present remuneration ====\nPresently, remuneration varies from state to state, some states pay no wages or commission, some pay an [[honorarium]] and while others pay nothing.\n\nUnder the [[Digital India]] initiative, some states have taken to cutting delays in paying honorarium, set as percentage of the revenue collected from the respective estate, via the regular direct electronic transfer, the [[Government of Haryana]] is one such example.<ref name=HarNar1>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/nambardars-to-get-honorarium-in-their-accounts/430730.html Nambardars to get honorarium in their accounts], [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]], 3 July 2017.</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Government of Haryana raised the monthly honorarium for lambardars from INR1,500 to INR3,000.<ref>[https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/hry-govt-to-double-monthly-honorarium-of-lambardars-to-rs-3000/1472234 Hry govt to double monthly honorarium of Lambardars to Rs 3,000], Outlook megazine, 4 Feb 2019.</ref>\n\n==Pakistan==\n===Legal description===\nThe lambardari system in Pakistan is based on the [[Partition of India|pre-partition]] Indian land revenue system. After the 1947, both nations have made changes to the land revenue acts, leading to some differences in the practice and implementation, though the basic concept remains same.

During drought and famine they frequently abandoned the land and moved to other places. Hence, the land ownership was not a permanent concept. They were taxed by the rulers of the day based on the number of the cattle and area of the land cultivated. After the famine of 1783, many cultivators abandoned the villages and migrated elsewhere, and some land was sold by the owners. Slowly prominent farmers came into the possession of large lands, and they acquired the status of proprietors of the village estate and were recorded as such during the settlement of 1840-41 by the [[British Raj]]. These estates came to be known as zamindari or pattidari tenures, most influential and the largest estate-holders among them in due time became zaildars and lambardars. The British even used them as a localised dispute ombudsman and gave these big zamindars some moral policing rights. During the settlement of 1840-41, the tenants were classified into three classes: (a) those who had held land continuously for many years at a fixed rent and were not liable to ejectment, (b) the tenants in ''bhaiachara'' (brotherhood) villages who paid rent at the same rate as the members of brotherhood and who so long as they paid this rate were never ejected, (c) and those who cultivated from year to year under fresh agreement. These tenancies were further  classified  during 1863 settlement and a definite status was fixed on different classes of tenants. The ordinary division into tenants with or without right of occupancy was  adopted. Thus, the concept of the formal permanent ownership of the land came into being, and became a legalized and formally documented.<ref name=gaz1/>\n\n==India==\n=== The Land Revenue System ===\nEach  estate  is  represented  by  one  or more lambardars in  its  dealings  with  the government. Estates are grouped into patwar circles under the charge of a [[Patwari]], while 15 to 20 circles form the charge of a Kanungo, whose duty is to supervise the work of Patwaris. An estate is the unit of land revenue administration for the collection of tax. Each estate is usually equal to a village. Each estate is individually assessed by a [[Patwari]] and its record of rights and register of fiscal and agricultural statistics maintained separately. All the proprietors are by law jointly responsible for payment of land  revenue.\n\n=== Land Reforms of India ===\nAfter India's independence in 1947, government enacted several land reforms such as the assessment of permissible area in relation to a family instead of an individual, and reduced the permissible area to the set limit (e.g. to 7.25 hectares in Punjab) of land under assured irrigation capable of growing at least 1 crop in a year or 21.8 hectares in respect of any other land including banjar and land under orchards. In addition to legally capping the amount land holding by the government, the voluntary [[Bhoodan movement]] of 1950s and 60s also led to the donation of the land ownership from rich owners to the landless tenants. Government also undertook aggressive land consolidation and standardization of ''killa'' (agricultural plots of one acre each).\n\n===Legal description===\nIn India, each state has its own land acts governing the system of Nambardari. Following acts are applicable to the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Haryana]] [[Himachal Pradesh]] [[Delhi]] [[Rajisthan]] [[Madhya Pradesh]].\n\n====The Land Holdings Tax Act, 1973 ====\nBefore the ''Land Holdings Tax Act, 1973'', was enacted, the lambardar was paid \n''pachhotra'' (commission) at the rate of 5 per cent of land revenue.  In this act various levies  were  consolidated  into  land  holdings  tax and lambardars' share was fixed at 3 per cent of the new tax revenue.<ref name=gaz1/>\n\n==== Present remuneration ====\nPresently, remuneration varies from state to state, some states pay no wages or commission, some pay an [[honorarium]] and while others pay nothing.\n\nUnder the [[Digital India]] initiative, some states have taken to cutting delays in paying honorarium, set as percentage of the revenue collected from the respective estate, via the regular direct electronic transfer, the [[Government of Haryana]] is one such example.<ref name=HarNar1>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/nambardars-to-get-honorarium-in-their-accounts/430730.html Nambardars to get honorarium in their accounts], [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]], 3 July 2017.</ref>\n\nIn 2019, Government of Haryana raised the monthly honorarium for lambardars from INR1,500 to INR3,000.<ref>[https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/hry-govt-to-double-monthly-honorarium-of-lambardars-to-rs-3000/1472234 Hry govt to double monthly honorarium of Lambardars to Rs 3,000], Outlook megazine, 4 Feb 2019.</ref>\n\n==Pakistan==\n===Legal description===\nThe lambardari system in Pakistan is based on the [[Partition of India|pre-partition]] Indian land revenue system. After the 1947, both nations have made changes to the land revenue acts, leading to some differences in the practice and implementation, though the basic concept remains same. India has undertaken aggressive land reforms, capping the ceiling of the area of land holding, and distribution of the ownership of excess land above the ceiling limit to the cultivators tenants thus reducing the percentage of tenants by converting them into the permanent owners. These reforms are pending in Pakistan, leading to the landownership in limited hands.\n\n====The West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967====\n* Section 4 (28): Village Officer:  person appointed under this Act whose duty is to collect, or to supervise the collection of, the revenue of an estate and include Kanungos, Patwaris, Service Centre Officials and Headmen (Lambardars).\n* Section 36: The Board of Revenue may, with the previous approval of Government, make rules to regulate the appointments, duties, emoluments, punishments, suspension and removal of Village Officers.<ref>http://punjabrevenue.nic.in/pbrev_act87_II.htm</ref>\n\n====The West Pakistan Land Revenue Rules, 1968====\nRule 16.

Jampolsky]] has been among the most effective promoters of the Course. His first book ''Love is Letting go of Fear'', which is based on the principles of the Course, was published in 1979 and after being endorsed on [[Johnny Carson]]'s show went on to sell over 3 million copies by 1990.<ref>Hammer, O, 2004, ''Claiming Knowledge : Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age'', Studies in the history of religions 90, Brill, Leiden, Boston p451</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n''A Course in Miracles'' was written as a collaborative venture between Schucman and William ('Bill') Thetford. In 1958 Schucman began her professional career at [[Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center]] in New York City as Thetford's research associate.<ref>[https://acim.org/Scribing/about_scribes.html Helen Schucman's Career]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://acim.biz/a-course-in-miracles-book-acim/|title=A Course in Miracles Book ACIM Lessons Online and Text|work=ACIM Portal|access-date=25 December 2017}}</ref> In the spring of 1965, at a time when their weekly office meetings had become so contentious that they both dreaded them, Thetford suggested to Schucman that \"[t]here must be another way\".<ref name=\"Collaboration\">{{cite book | title=Helen Schucman: Autobiography, in \"Origins of A Course in Miracles\" 3:27\u201328 |publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace Archives, Tiburon, CA)}}</ref> Schucman believed that this interaction acted as a stimulus, triggering a series of inner experiences that were understood by her as visions, dreams, and heightened imagery, along with an \"inner voice\" which she identified as Jesus. She said that on October 21, 1965, an \"inner voice\" told her: \"This is a Course in Miracles, please take notes.\" Schucman said that the writing made her very uncomfortable, though it never seriously occurred to her to stop.<ref>Skutch, Robert. ''Journey Without Distance: The Story Behind A Course in Miracles''. [[Ten Speed Press]], Berkeley, CA, 1984, p. 58.</ref> The next day, she explained the events of her \"note taking\" to Thetford. To her surprise, Thetford encouraged her to continue the process. He also offered to assist her in typing out her notes as she read them to him. The transcription the next day repeated itself regularly for many years to come. In 1972, the dictation of the three main sections of the Course was completed, with some additional minor dictation coming after that point.<ref>[http://www.miraclestudies.net/Scribe.html Final Dictation of The Song of Prayer]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ken wapnick seattle unity cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Kenneth Wapnick helped edit the book and founded the Foundation for A Course in Miracles]]\n\nFr. [[Benedict Groeschel]], a Roman Catholic priest who had studied under Thetford and worked with Schucman, introduced Kenneth Wapnick to Schucman and Thetford in November 1972. Groeschel was given a copy of the ''ACIM'' manuscript in 1973 and was instructed by Schucman not to distribute the manuscript; however, with Schucman's permission, he made it available to Wapnick. Wapnick reviewed the draft and discussed with Schucman and Thetford, further revisions that he felt were needed in order to publish the book. Thetford made a few further editorial decisions about the \"Principles of Miracles\" section, and soon afterwards opted to withdraw from direct involvement. Wapnick and Schucman deleted personal material apparently directed only to Schucman and Thetford, created chapter and section headings, and corrected various inconsistencies in paragraph structure, punctuation, and capitalization.<ref name=\"The Story of A Course In Miracles\">{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpJ6BO8xeDA |title= The Story of A Course in Miracles = Documentary where Bill Thetford, Helen Schucman, and Ken Wapnick talk about A Course in Miracles  |accessdate=21 February 2011}}</ref> The editing process was completed by February 1975. Wapnick subsequently became a teacher of ''ACIM,'' a co-founder and president of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles (FACIM), and a director and executive committee member of the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP). \n==Contents==\nThe content of ''A Course in Miracles'' is presented in the three sections: \"Textbook\", \"Workbook\", and \"Manual for Teachers\":\n* The \"Textbook\" presents a thought system about truth and illusion on two levels:\n**It states that  ''everything'' involving time, space, and [[perception]] is illusory. It presents a monism which states that God is the only truth and reality: perfect, unchanging, unchangeable, extending only love, though not in time and space, which cannot really be comprehended from a dualistic perspective. The theory further states that all life as we perceive it is actually one life (because God has only one son, sometimes called the collective sonship), dreaming of separation and fragmentation. It claims that  eternity is outside time and space and that this dream never occurred in reality and is \"already over\", though not the (illusory) perception. When addressing the question of how such an illusory dream could arise from a perfect and unchanging God, the Course states that to ask that question is to presume that the time-space dream is real, which it states is not. ''A Course in Miracles'' states that to think we exist as individuals is the fundamental error. However, since we experience ourselves in time and space, reading these pages, the course presents its thought system on a second level:\n** The time-space level, or \"perceptory\" level, which is referred to as \"the dream\". ''A Course in Miracles'' states that this level was \"made\" by the \"sleeping Son\" as an attack on God. Furthermore, the \"Son\" is regarded as not just Jesus, but as all collective life. In this time-space dream, perception is continuously fueled by what it originated from: separation, judgment, and attack. This results in what the Course calls the \"sin-guilt-fear\" cycle: we ''sinned'' by rejecting God and making a universe of time-space (the [[Big Bang]]); this results in ''guilt'' over our rejection of our Creator, and subsequent ''fear'' of God's wrath. The \"sin-guilt-fear\" is described as too horrendous to face, and therefore subsequently [[Psychological projection|projected]] out, so that to ''Homo sapiens'' it seems that evil is everywhere except in himself. The world becomes a threatening place, in which we are born only to fear, fight, and die. The thought that keeps this process going is referred to as \"[[Ego (religion)|ego]]\", or \"the wrong mind\". ''A Course in Miracles'' concludes that happiness cannot be found in earthly time-space life, and urges the reader not to commit suicide but rather to make a fundamental mind shift from \"condemnation-out-of-fear\" (mindlessness) to \"forgiveness-out-of-love\" ([[mindfulness]]), since our \"right mind\" is outside time-space and cannot be harmed by worldly attacks. According to the course, seeing \"the Face of Christ\" in all living things is the way to \"accept the Atonement\" and ultimately awaken from the dream and return to the eternity of God. Ultimately, this means the end of [[individuality]] and of the ego. In this respect, there are parallels with the Indian concept of [[karma]] and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', which Helen Schucman reports that she was not familiar with, although William Thetford was. The basic philosophy of the Course could be described as [[Vedanta]] in Christian dress and can be seen in the same tradition as other Eastern-influenced American religious and philosophical thought such as that of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Mary Baker Eddy]] and [[Joel S. Goldsmith]].\n* The \"Workbook\" presents 365 lessons, one for each day of the year, which claim to recondition the student's mind from \"condemnation-out-of-fear\" to \"forgiveness-out-of-love\". ''A Course in Miracles'' defines \"miracle\" as the conscious choice to make that mind shift, including its non-observable effects on the minds of others.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The workbook lessons attempt to train the reader to see oneness in all living things for a steadily increasing time of the day. The lessons aim at convincing by experience. The core message of the workbook is that, to forgive oneself completely, a person must (a) forgive all living things, and (b) do this by instruction of the Holy Spirit (i.e., the \"Voice for God,\" \"right mind,\" \"Inner Teacher,\" or \"intuition\"). At the end, after one year, the workbook states that it is \"a beginning, not an end\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* The \"Manual for Teachers\" is a collection of questions and answers. It aims at motivating the reader to become a \"teacher of God\": a human being living in time and space, but at the same time seeing oneness in everything, having let go of all individual and separate interests, and being fully guided by the \"voice\" of the Holy Spirit.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* In the third edition, the two pamphlets \"Psychotherapy\" and \"The Song of Prayer\" were added. They elaborate on the parallels with current psychotherapy and on the meaning of prayer, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n== Foundation for Inner Peace and other editions ==\nA limited edition release of 300 copies of the first three sections of the book was published by The Foundation for Inner Peace, which had been created solely to publish ''A Course in Miracles''. In June 1976, FIP published the first three sections of ''ACIM'' as three hardcover volumes in a 5,000 copy run, along with the publication of the supplemental booklet ''Psychology: Purpose, Process, Practice.'' In 1985, FIP began publishing a single soft-cover volume containing all three sections. In 1992, FIP published a second, hardcover edition. This revision added some editorial content and a verse-numbering system, as well as a \"Clarification of Terms\" section. At this time, FIP also published the supplemental ''Song of Prayer'' booklet.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn October 2004, a long-standing copyright battle over ''A Course In Miracles'' ended with a ruling that put the work into the [[public domain]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn January 2006, Course in Miracles Society, a non-profit established in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], published ''A Course in Miracles-Original Edition'' (ACIM OE), which is the 1972 manuscript as completed by Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn August 2017, the Circle of Atonement published ''A Course in Miracles: Complete and Annotated Edition'', which contains the original material that Helen Schucman wrote up to 1972, prior to the Foundation for Inner Peace edition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Reception==\nSince it went on sale in 1976, the text has been translated into 22 languages.<ref name=\"translations\">{{cite web | url = http://www.acim.org |title=ACIM Translations |publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace |accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> The book is distributed globally, spawning a range of organized groups.<ref>Bradby, Ruth, \"A course in miracles in Ireland\". 147 \u2013 162 in Olivia Cosgrove et al.

Jampolsky]] has been among the most effective promoters of the Course. His first book ''Love is Letting go of Fear'', which is based on the principles of the Course, was published in 1979 and after being endorsed on [[Johnny Carson]]'s show went on to sell over 3 million copies by 1990.<ref>Hammer, O, 2004, ''Claiming Knowledge : Strategies of Epistemology from Theosophy to the New Age'', Studies in the history of religions 90, Brill, Leiden, Boston p451</ref>\n\n==Origins==\n''A Course in Miracles'' was written as a collaborative venture between Schucman and William ('Bill') Thetford. In 1958 Schucman began her professional career at [[Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center]] in New York City as Thetford's research associate.<ref>[https://acim.org/Scribing/about_scribes.html Helen Schucman's Career]</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://acim.biz/a-course-in-miracles-book-acim/|title=A Course in Miracles Book ACIM Lessons Online and Text|work=ACIM Portal|access-date=25 December 2017}}</ref> In the spring of 1965, at a time when their weekly office meetings had become so contentious that they both dreaded them, Thetford suggested to Schucman that \"[t]here must be another way\".<ref name=\"Collaboration\">{{cite book | title=Helen Schucman: Autobiography, in \"Origins of A Course in Miracles\" 3:27\u201328 |publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace Archives, Tiburon, CA)}}</ref> Schucman believed that this interaction acted as a stimulus, triggering a series of inner experiences that were understood by her as visions, dreams, and heightened imagery, along with an \"inner voice\" which she identified as Jesus. She said that on October 21, 1965, an \"inner voice\" told her: \"This is a Course in Miracles, please take notes.\" Schucman said that the writing made her very uncomfortable, though it never seriously occurred to her to stop.<ref>Skutch, Robert. ''Journey Without Distance: The Story Behind A Course in Miracles''. [[Ten Speed Press]], Berkeley, CA, 1984, p. 58.</ref> The next day, she explained the events of her \"note taking\" to Thetford. To her surprise, Thetford encouraged her to continue the process. He also offered to assist her in typing out her notes as she read them to him. The transcription the next day repeated itself regularly for many years to come. In 1972, the dictation of the three main sections of the Course was completed, with some additional minor dictation coming after that point.<ref>[http://www.miraclestudies.net/Scribe.html Final Dictation of The Song of Prayer]</ref>\n\n[[Image:Ken wapnick seattle unity cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Kenneth Wapnick helped edit the book and founded the Foundation for A Course in Miracles]]\n\nFr. [[Benedict Groeschel]], a Roman Catholic priest who had studied under Thetford and worked with Schucman, introduced Kenneth Wapnick to Schucman and Thetford in November 1972. Groeschel was given a copy of the ''ACIM'' manuscript in 1973 and was instructed by Schucman not to distribute the manuscript; however, with Schucman's permission, he made it available to Wapnick. Wapnick reviewed the draft and discussed with Schucman and Thetford, further revisions that he felt were needed in order to publish the book. Thetford made a few further editorial decisions about the \"Principles of Miracles\" section, and soon afterwards opted to withdraw from direct involvement. Wapnick and Schucman deleted personal material apparently directed only to Schucman and Thetford, created chapter and section headings, and corrected various inconsistencies in paragraph structure, punctuation, and capitalization.<ref name=\"The Story of A Course In Miracles\">{{cite web | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpJ6BO8xeDA |title= The Story of A Course in Miracles = Documentary where Bill Thetford, Helen Schucman, and Ken Wapnick talk about A Course in Miracles  |accessdate=21 February 2011}}</ref> The editing process was completed by February 1975. Wapnick subsequently became a teacher of ''ACIM,'' a co-founder and president of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles (FACIM), and a director and executive committee member of the Foundation for Inner Peace (FIP). \n==Contents==\nThe content of ''A Course in Miracles'' is presented in the three sections: \"Textbook\", \"Workbook\", and \"Manual for Teachers\":\n* The \"Textbook\" presents a thought system about truth and illusion on two levels:\n**It states that  ''everything'' involving time, space, and [[perception]] is illusory. It presents a monism which states that God is the only truth and reality: perfect, unchanging, unchangeable, extending only love, though not in time and space, which cannot really be comprehended from a dualistic perspective. The theory further states that all life as we perceive it is actually one life (because God has only one son, sometimes called the collective sonship), dreaming of separation and fragmentation. It claims that  eternity is outside time and space and that this dream never occurred in reality and is \"already over\", though not the (illusory) perception. When addressing the question of how such an illusory dream could arise from a perfect and unchanging God, the Course states that to ask that question is to presume that the time-space dream is real, which it states is not. ''A Course in Miracles'' states that to think we exist as individuals is the fundamental error. However, since we experience ourselves in time and space, reading these pages, the course presents its thought system on a second level:\n** The time-space level, or \"perceptory\" level, which is referred to as \"the dream\". ''A Course in Miracles'' states that this level was \"made\" by the \"sleeping Son\" as an attack on God. Furthermore, the \"Son\" is regarded as not just Jesus, but as all collective life. In this time-space dream, perception is continuously fueled by what it originated from: separation, judgment, and attack. This results in what the Course calls the \"sin-guilt-fear\" cycle: we ''sinned'' by rejecting God and making a universe of time-space (the [[Big Bang]]); this results in ''guilt'' over our rejection of our Creator, and subsequent ''fear'' of God's wrath. The \"sin-guilt-fear\" is described as too horrendous to face, and therefore subsequently [[Psychological projection|projected]] out, so that to ''Homo sapiens'' it seems that evil is everywhere except in himself. The world becomes a threatening place, in which we are born only to fear, fight, and die. The thought that keeps this process going is referred to as \"[[Ego (religion)|ego]]\", or \"the wrong mind\". ''A Course in Miracles'' concludes that happiness cannot be found in earthly time-space life, and urges the reader not to commit suicide but rather to make a fundamental mind shift from \"condemnation-out-of-fear\" (mindlessness) to \"forgiveness-out-of-love\" ([[mindfulness]]), since our \"right mind\" is outside time-space and cannot be harmed by worldly attacks. According to the course, seeing \"the Face of Christ\" in all living things is the way to \"accept the Atonement\" and ultimately awaken from the dream and return to the eternity of God. Ultimately, this means the end of [[individuality]] and of the ego. In this respect, there are parallels with the Indian concept of [[karma]] and the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', which Helen Schucman reports that she was not familiar with, although William Thetford was. The basic philosophy of the Course could be described as [[Vedanta]] in Christian dress and can be seen in the same tradition as other Eastern-influenced American religious and philosophical thought such as that of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Mary Baker Eddy]] and [[Joel S. Goldsmith]].\n* The \"Workbook\" presents 365 lessons, one for each day of the year, which claim to recondition the student's mind from \"condemnation-out-of-fear\" to \"forgiveness-out-of-love\". ''A Course in Miracles'' defines \"miracle\" as the conscious choice to make that mind shift, including its non-observable effects on the minds of others.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} The workbook lessons attempt to train the reader to see oneness in all living things for a steadily increasing time of the day. The lessons aim at convincing by experience. The core message of the workbook is that, to forgive oneself completely, a person must (a) forgive all living things, and (b) do this by instruction of the Holy Spirit (i.e., the \"Voice for God,\" \"right mind,\" \"Inner Teacher,\" or \"intuition\"). At the end, after one year, the workbook states that it is \"a beginning, not an end\".{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* The \"Manual for Teachers\" is a collection of questions and answers. It aims at motivating the reader to become a \"teacher of God\": a human being living in time and space, but at the same time seeing oneness in everything, having let go of all individual and separate interests, and being fully guided by the \"voice\" of the Holy Spirit.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n* In the third edition, the two pamphlets \"Psychotherapy\" and \"The Song of Prayer\" were added. They elaborate on the parallels with current psychotherapy and on the meaning of prayer, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n== Foundation for Inner Peace and other editions ==\nA limited edition release of 300 copies of the first three sections of the book was published by The Foundation for Inner Peace, which had been created solely to publish ''A Course in Miracles''. In June 1976, FIP published the first three sections of ''ACIM'' as three hardcover volumes in a 5,000 copy run, along with the publication of the supplemental booklet ''Psychology: Purpose, Process, Practice.'' In 1985, FIP began publishing a single soft-cover volume containing all three sections. In 1992, FIP published a second, hardcover edition. This revision added some editorial content and a verse-numbering system, as well as a \"Clarification of Terms\" section. At this time, FIP also published the supplemental ''Song of Prayer'' booklet.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn October 2004, a long-standing copyright battle over ''A Course In Miracles'' ended with a ruling that put the work into the [[public domain]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn January 2006, Course in Miracles Society, a non-profit established in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], published ''A Course in Miracles-Original Edition'' (ACIM OE), which is the 1972 manuscript as completed by Helen Schucman and Bill Thetford.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nIn August 2017, the Circle of Atonement published ''A Course in Miracles: Complete and Annotated Edition'', which contains the original material that Helen Schucman wrote up to 1972, prior to the Foundation for Inner Peace edition.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\n==Reception==\nSince it went on sale in 1976, the text has been translated into 22 languages.<ref name=\"translations\">{{cite web | url = http://www.acim.org |title=ACIM Translations |publisher=Foundation for Inner Peace |accessdate=28 September 2009}}</ref> The book is distributed globally, spawning a range of organized groups.<ref>Bradby, Ruth, \"A course in miracles in Ireland\". 147 \u2013 162 in Olivia Cosgrove et al.
