Despite the name, the station is located in the neighborhood of [[Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn|Fort Hamilton]] (as its original name implied) at the intersection of 95th Street and Fourth Avenue in southwestern [[Brooklyn]]. It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe station was first planned in 1922 as the first part of an extension to [[Staten Island]] through [[Staten Island Tunnel|a tunnel]] under [[the Narrows]]. Construction began on December 17, 1923, after the construction contractor submitted, withdrew, and resubmitted its bid. The station opened on October 31, 1925, but the Staten Island extension was never built due to various funding disputes. The platform was lengthened in the 1960s.\n\n==History==\n\nOn August 25, 1922, the Transit Commission directed its chief engineer, [[Robert Ridgway (engineer)|Robert Ridgeway]], to plan an extension of the Fourth Avenue Line from 87th Street to Fort Hamilton. Initially, multiple stations along the extension were considered. This extension was to be the first part of an extension to [[Staten Island]] through a [[Staten Island Tunnel|tunnel]] under [[The Narrows]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/08/26/99061314.pdf|title=TO EXTEND SUBWAY TO FORT HAMILTON; Transit Commission Orders Plans for Lengthening the Fourth Avenue Line.

Despite the name, the station is located in the neighborhood of [[Fort Hamilton, Brooklyn|Fort Hamilton]] (as its original name implied) at the intersection of 95th Street and Fourth Avenue in southwestern [[Brooklyn]]. It is served by the [[R (New York City Subway service)|R]] train at all times.\n\nThe station was first planned in 1922 as the first part of an extension to [[Staten Island]] through [[Staten Island Tunnel|a tunnel]] under [[the Narrows]]. Construction began on December 17, 1923, after the construction contractor submitted, withdrew, and resubmitted its bid. The station opened on October 31, 1925, but the Staten Island extension was never built due to various funding disputes. The platform was lengthened in the 1960s.\n\n==History==\n\nOn August 25, 1922, the Transit Commission directed its chief engineer, [[Robert Ridgway (engineer)|Robert Ridgeway]], to plan an extension of the Fourth Avenue Line from 87th Street to Fort Hamilton. Initially, multiple stations along the extension were considered. This extension was to be the first part of an extension to [[Staten Island]] through a [[Staten Island Tunnel|tunnel]] under [[The Narrows]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1922/08/26/99061314.pdf|title=TO EXTEND SUBWAY TO FORT HAMILTON; Transit Commission Orders Plans for Lengthening the Fourth Avenue Line.

Ban immediately confronts the monster after telling Elaine to escape with the fountain, and successfully robs one of its hearts. Not realizing that it had more than one heart, he lets down his guard and as a result, both of them get severely injured by the monster. Both of them realize that the only way to survive was to drink the Fountain of Youth, which means that only one of them could live. The two of them wanted each other to drink the fountain, hoping for their survival. In desperation, Elaine seemingly drinks the liquid, only to kiss Ban and deliver it to him directly. Ban immediately recovers from the injuries after consuming the liquid, and quickly defeats the monster in rage. Before passing away, Elaine gives him the forest's last seed and he repeats, Someday, I'll definitely make you mine. Sadly, before he was able to finish the phrase, she was gone. Later on, somewhere within the Kingdom of Liones, Ban is judged and sentenced to death for his apparent sins of destroying the Fairy King's Forest, taking the Fountain of Youth and killing the Guardian Saint. As the captain of the guard asked Ban if he has any last words before execution, Ban told everyone present that he is no longer \"Bandit Ban\" and \"Undead Ban\" is now his name.\n| LineColor           = 575757\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Seven Deadly Sins (2014 TV series)\n| EpisodeNumber       = OVA2\n| EpisodeNumber2      = OVA2\n| Title               = Heroes Fun Time -Extra Stories Compilation-\n| TranslitTitle       = Eiy\u016b-tachi no Tawamure -Bangai-hensh\u016b-\n| NativeTitle         = \u82f1\u96c4\u305f\u3061\u306e\u622f\u308c -\u756a\u5916\u7de8\u96c6-\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2015|8|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = A series of short clips.\n| LineColor           = 575757\n}}\n|}</onlyinclude>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.shonenmagazine.com/smaga/nanatsunotaizai Official page at ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine'']\n*[http://www.7-taizai.net/ Official anime website]\n*[http://7ds.bngames.net/ Official video game website]\n*{{ann|anime|16167}}\n\n{{The Seven Deadly Sins}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seven Deadly Sins, The}}\n[[Category:2014 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:The Seven Deadly Sins seasons|1]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|2014 Japanese anime TV series}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:''The Seven Deadly Sins'' (2014 TV series)}}\n{{Infobox television season\n|bgcolour       = #575757\n|image          = The Seven Deadly Sins 2014 TV series.jpg\n|caption        = The cover of the first Japanese [[Blu-ray]] release.\n|country        = [[Japan]]\n|network        = [[Japan News Network|JNN]], [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]], [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]\n|first_aired    = {{Start date|2014|10|5}}\n|last_aired     = {{End date|2015|3|29}}\n|num_episodes   = 24\n|prev_season    = N/A\n|episode_list   = List of The Seven Deadly Sins episodes\n|next_season    = ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins: Signs of Holy War|Signs of Holy War]]''\n}}\n{{nihongo|'''''The Seven Deadly Sins'''''|\u4e03\u3064\u306e\u5927\u7f6a|Nanatsu no Taizai|lead=yes}} is an anime television series based on a Japanese fantasy [[manga]] series [[The Seven Deadly Sins (manga)|of the same name]] written and illustrated by [[Nakaba Suzuki]].

He quickly climbs up the large majestic tree, and ends up meeting a mysterious young girl whom he ignores initially. He decides to ask her who she is, only to discover that she was the Guardian Saint protecting the fountain. Swiftly, she swings her hand and the winds blow Ban off the tree. However, Ban survives the fall and persistently continues to climb up again. He repeatedly climbs up and gets blown off, until both of them grows extremely annoyed. In order to obtain the fountain, Ban equips himself with his Nunchaku, leading Elaine to believe that he was planning to kill and steal like all other humans. To her surprise, he quickly grabs the Fountain of Youth and begins drinking. But before he could even take a sip, Elaine manipulates the tree branches and immobilizes him by grabbing all of his limbs. She then persuades him that without the Fountain of Youth, the forest itself will die. Astonishingly, Ban replies straightforwardly, stating that he understands. When Elaine decides to read his heart, she discovers that he really had the intentions of giving up. She releases him and the two begin to get to know each other. Ban tells her that the reason for stealing the fountain is to hope for something good to happen in his life. In response, she replies saying that she already lived for over 700 years, protecting the cup in place of her brother, King, who abandoned her. Ban decides to show her his ale label collection and the two bonded over a span of 7 days. Suddenly, when Ban was away, she quietly whispers that she wished that he had come to steal her instead of the Fountain of Youth. She was startled to discover Ban behind her, who had heard what she said, and realized that they both have similar thoughts and feelings. Out of the blue, a mysterious monster from the Demon Clan appears, burning the forest with its Purgatory Fire. Ban immediately confronts the monster after telling Elaine to escape with the fountain, and successfully robs one of its hearts. Not realizing that it had more than one heart, he lets down his guard and as a result, both of them get severely injured by the monster. Both of them realize that the only way to survive was to drink the Fountain of Youth, which means that only one of them could live. The two of them wanted each other to drink the fountain, hoping for their survival. In desperation, Elaine seemingly drinks the liquid, only to kiss Ban and deliver it to him directly. Ban immediately recovers from the injuries after consuming the liquid, and quickly defeats the monster in rage. Before passing away, Elaine gives him the forest's last seed and he repeats, Someday, I'll definitely make you mine. Sadly, before he was able to finish the phrase, she was gone. Later on, somewhere within the Kingdom of Liones, Ban is judged and sentenced to death for his apparent sins of destroying the Fairy King's Forest, taking the Fountain of Youth and killing the Guardian Saint. As the captain of the guard asked Ban if he has any last words before execution, Ban told everyone present that he is no longer \"Bandit Ban\" and \"Undead Ban\" is now his name.\n| LineColor           = 575757\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = The Seven Deadly Sins (2014 TV series)\n| EpisodeNumber       = OVA2\n| EpisodeNumber2      = OVA2\n| Title               = Heroes Fun Time -Extra Stories Compilation-\n| TranslitTitle       = Eiy\u016b-tachi no Tawamure -Bangai-hensh\u016b-\n| NativeTitle         = \u82f1\u96c4\u305f\u3061\u306e\u622f\u308c -\u756a\u5916\u7de8\u96c6-\n| NativeTitleLangCode = ja \n| OriginalAirDate     = {{Start date|2015|8|12}}\n| ShortSummary        = A series of short clips.\n| LineColor           = 575757\n}}\n|}</onlyinclude>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.shonenmagazine.com/smaga/nanatsunotaizai Official page at ''Weekly Sh\u014dnen Magazine'']\n*[http://www.7-taizai.net/ Official anime website]\n*[http://7ds.bngames.net/ Official video game website]\n*{{ann|anime|16167}}\n\n{{The Seven Deadly Sins}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Seven Deadly Sins, The}}\n[[Category:2014 Japanese television seasons]]\n[[Category:The Seven Deadly Sins seasons|1]]\n", "name_user": "2001:16a2:b770:8000:c815:39ce:573b:5431", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Seven_Deadly_Sins_(2014_TV_series)"}

Bundesliga]], the DFB-Pokal ([[German Cup]]), and the then third division [[Regionalliga]]. The scandal has been described as the largest controversy in German football since the [[Bundesliga scandal (1971)|Bundesliga scandal]] of the early 1970s, as numerous players, coaches and officials have been accused of involvement with an organised crime group in the scheme, which came on the eve of Germany playing host to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].\n\nAlthough it does not appear that any [[Bundesliga|1st Bundesliga]] games were involved, the matches in question do include a DFB Cup first-round contest between regional side [[SC Paderborn 07|Paderborn]] and Bundesliga heavyweights [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] played on 21 August 2004. Hamburg lost 2\u20134 as two highly questionable penalties were awarded to Paderborn and Hamburg footballer [[\u00c9mile Mpenza]] was sent off for protesting as the club was eliminated from the lucrative competition.\n\n==Overview==\nFour referees \u2013 Lutz Michael Fr\u00f6hlich, Olaf Blumenstein, Manuel Gr\u00e4fe, and Felix Zwayer \u2013 went to officials of the [[German Football Association]] (Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Bund, DFB) with their suspicions about Hoyzer. Initially, the DFB did not immediately act, but after becoming aware of the accusations, Hoyzer stepped down from his role as a referee.\n\nIndications are that Hoyzer had regular meetings in Berlin with a group of three brothers who were part of a [[Croatia]]n gambling syndicate connected to an organized crime group. After a confession from Hoyzer, several suspects were put under surveillance and on 28 January 2005 a number of people were arrested. Milan \u0160apina, operator of the ''Caf\u00e9 King'' sports betting agency and his brother Philip were taken into custody, along with [[Hertha BSC]] players [[Alexander Madlung]], [[Nando Rafael]] and [[Josip \u0160imuni\u0107]]. Madlung, Rafael, and \u0160imuni\u0107 all played in Hertha's surprising 3\u20132 defeat to third-division side [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] in their 22 September 2004 German Cup match, with Madlung giving up a crucial 80th minute own goal, only four minutes after coming on as a substitute. The trio came under suspicion for having been known to associate with the \u0160apina brothers, but there has been no proof that they actually participated in the manipulation of this or any other match.\n\nAs witnesses against Hoyzer, the [[Berlin]] referees [[Lutz Michael Fr\u00f6hlich]] and [[Manuel Gr\u00e4fe]] were immediately relieved of their officiating responsibilities for their own safety, being replaced by Franz-Xaver Wack and Torsten Kinh\u00f6fer. The referees scheduled to officiate matches in the 19th round of Bundesliga play on 29 and 30 January 2005 were all changed the day before the games were played.\n\nHoyzer co-operated with investigators in helping to uncover the details of the scheme, implicating other officials, players, and a group of Croatian-based gamblers. This led to an investigation by the league, as well as a criminal investigation. By the end of 2005, it appeared that the scandal did not directly involve the Bundesliga and was confined to lower divisions. The investigations lead to the following results:\n*Hoyzer was banned for life from any role in football and received a 2-year-5-month prison sentence. Jail sentences for Hoyzer and five other defendants were confirmed in December 2006 after they had lost their final appeals in court.\n*Referee Dominik Marks was banned for life and received a 1-year-6-month sentence for his involvement.\n*The three Croatian brothers orchestrating the scheme received sentences ranging from 2-year-11-month in prison to 1 year \u2013 suspended.\n*Referee Felix Zwayer was banned for 6 months for his involvement including accepting a \u20ac300 bribe from Hoyzer.\n*Referee Torsten Koop received a three-month ban for not promptly reporting an approach from Hoyzer.\n*Matches involving officials and players accused or convicted for their involvement in the scheme were subject to review by the league.\n*Hamburger SV received compensation worth up to \u20ac2 million for its forced early exit from the DFB Cup and compensation for certain other teams affected was arranged.\n*After review, replays have been ordered for a number of lower division games, while other results will stand.\n*A number of changes have been put in place or proposed to ensure closer oversight of referees and other game officials.\n*Once the criminal issues involved have been resolved, it is expected that a number of civil suits will arise as some clubs and individuals seek compensation for harm suffered as a result of the scandal.\n\n==Response of the DFB==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}The DFB-Kontrollausschuss (DFB Committee of Control) reacted to the scandal with a number of measures intended to prevent similar incidents in the future:\n* The committee originally intended to follow the [[UEFA]] practice of designating game officials on just two days' notice before the match, rather than on the existing schedule of four days' notice. This suggestion was abandoned as impractical.\n* Referees who are promoted to officiate in second-division games will first be observed over a three-year period in the Regionalliga.\n* Previously, matches involving Bundesliga teams in the [[German Cup]] had not been subject to observation by an arbitrator, but will be in the future. This fourth official will be certified for first division matches and able to act as a substitute game official on short notice if required.\n* Substitutions may be made for the two junior game officials on the day of the match at the direction of league officials.\n* Video replays will be used more extensively in future.\n* Where a potential problem has been identified with game officials, all those involved may be subject to an immediate interim suspension under the \"[[Sportradar|Betradar]]\" early warning system until the issue is resolved.\n* The DFB is proposing to offer its own sports betting program for the league in 2006\u201307 in order to have some control and oversight of the popular and lucrative sideline.\n* There is some consideration of responsibility for the selection of game officials being put into the hands of the DFL (Deutsche Fu\u00dfball Liga or German Football League), the governing body responsible for all of German football, rather than leaving this to the control of individual leagues.\n\nThese measures are regarded as an immediate first step taken to manage the problem of match-fixing. Other more detailed proposals will be put forward by an expert committee appointed to address the issue. On 13 February 2005, the DFB announced the ''Ausschuss f\u00fcr das Problem Spielmanipulationen'' (Commission for the Problem of Match Manipulation) as being made up of DFB President Zwanziger, DFL President Hackmann, Treasurer Schmidhuber, and Secretary General Horst Schmidt.\n\nThe DFL is also considering a departure from tradition by employing professional officials in place of the amateurs now used. DFL President [[Werner Hackmann]] sees the controversial step as possible in light of the recent scandal. The former chairman of the board of [[Hamburger SV]] feels that the use of full-time referees earning a good wage could help deflect bribery attempts in the future. Former star player and head of Germany's [[2006 FIFA World Cup Organizing Committee]] [[Franz Beckenbauer]] expressed opposition to the idea of employing professional officials feeling that the current system has worked quite well and is solidly supported by the excellent training program run by the DFB. The former [[FIFA]] [[Referee (association football)|referee]] [[Hellmut Krug]], DFB Director of Officials (Schiedsrichterabteilung) criticized the control system the DFB had in place because it had been known for some time that Hoyzer was making dubious decisions, but there was no action taken. He also emphasized the more general need for observers to prepare written match reports as is the practise for all Bundesliga matches.\n\n== The scandal and the 2006 World Cup ==\nThere was some fear that the scandal affecting the largest football association in the world could have some negative impact on the upcoming World Cup to be hosted by Germany in 2006. While World Cup Organising Committee chief Franz Beckenbauer expressed his concern, government spokesman [[Thomas Steg]] acknowledged the efforts of the DFB in acting in a committed manner in quickly dealing with the issue. A spokesman for Germany's [[Bundesministerium des Innern|Ministry of the Interior]] warned against an atmosphere of general suspicion and exaggerated mistrust given what appeared to be, on investigation, the narrow scope of the problem. It was felt that the response to the scandal by the DFB demonstrated the general effectiveness of the sport's governing institutions. \n[[Federal Minister of the Interior (Germany)|Interior Minister]] [[Otto Schily]] also encouraged all game officials to support the DFB and public prosecutor's office in quickly addressing any suspicions raised. He indicated that it was clear that the vast majority of officials conduct themselves in an honest and professional manner and that to be generally suspicious of the game's officials without cause would be unfair.\n\nThe scandal attracted international media attention, but DFB and FIFA worked aggressively to ensure that the controversy died down before the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].\n\n==Affected matches==\nIn the course of the investigation by the DFB a number of matches were examined to determine if there was an attempt to manipulate them and if any such attempt had affected the outcome. The matches and their relevant detail are listed below in chronological order. The DFB set a cut off date of 30 June 2005 for filing protests over matches that may have been subject to attempted manipulation. While Hoyzer had drawn the suspicion of a number of his fellow officials sometime earlier, it was the 21 August 2004 match between [[SC Paderborn 07]] and [[Hamburger SV]] that precipitated the complaint to the DFB against him.\n\n*30 May 2004 [[Wuppertaler SV]] \u2013 [[Werder Bremen|Werder Bremen Amateure]] 1\u20130\n:This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Hoyzer. There was no determination of manipulation. Bremen did not file a protest as the result did not materially affect their standing in the league table. The match was not replayed and the result left to stand.\n\n*5 June 2004 [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] \u2013 [[FC St. Pauli]] 3\u20132\n:This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Hoyzer. There was a determination of manipulation, but because the season was completed by the time the determination was made the match was not replayed and the result left to stand. Negotiations are underway to arrange compensation for St. Pauli.{{Update inline|date=November 2015}}\n\n*11 August 2004 [[VfL Wolfsburg|VfL Wolfsburg Amateure]] \u2013 [[Fortuna D\u00fcsseldorf]] 1\u20131\n:This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Hoyzer.

Hoyzer testified that Marks received payment to attempt to manipulate the outcome. The contest was replayed near the end of the season on 12 April 2005 with ''Berlin'' repeating their victory, this time by a score of 6:0. No other compensation was ordered.\n\n*14 August 2004 [[FC St. Pauli]] \u2013 [[VfL Osnabr\u00fcck]] 2\u20133\n:This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Hoyzer.

The match was not replayed and the result left to stand.\n\n*21 August 2004 [[SC Paderborn 07]] \u2013 [[Hamburger SV]] 4\u20132\n:This opening round German Cup match was refereed by Hoyzer who admitted to attempting to influence the outcome of the game by awarding a number of unjustified penalties against Hamburg. HSV striker [[Emile Mpenza]] was [[Misconduct (football)|sent off]] for protesting calls. The obviously questionable nature of the calls in this match caused a number of Hoyzer's fellow officials to complain to the [[German Football Association]] which led to the opening of the investigations that revealed the scandal.\n\n:By the time the fix was revealed several more Cup rounds had been played and Paderborn had been eliminated. The match will not be replayed and Mpenza's red card was rescinded. HSV was awarded \u20ac500,000 in compensation and will also be awarded a [[Germany national football team|Germany international]] match at [[AOL Arena|the club's home ground]] which could generate an additional \u20ac1.5 million in revenue.\n\n*27 August 2004 [[Rot-Weiss Essen]] \u2013 [[FC Rot-Wei\u00df Erfurt]] 0\u20130\n:This 2.

Bundesliga match was refereed by Hoyzer who admitted to manipulating the match by awarding Ahlen a questionable penalty. The match was replayed near the end of the season on 27 April 2005 with Burghausen able to reverse the result with a 3:1 win. The outcome did not otherwise materially affect the standing of the two clubs in the league table. No other compensation was ordered.\n\n*6 November 2004 [[KFC Uerdingen 05]] \u2013 [[VfL Osnabr\u00fcck]] 1\u20134\n:This Regionalliga Nord match was refereed by Hoyzer.

Bundesliga]], the DFB-Pokal ([[German Cup]]), and the then third division [[Regionalliga]]. The scandal has been described as the largest controversy in German football since the [[Bundesliga scandal (1971)|Bundesliga scandal]] of the early 1970s, as numerous players, coaches and officials have been accused of involvement with an organised crime group in the scheme, which came on the eve of Germany playing host to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].\n\nAlthough it does not appear that any [[Bundesliga|1st Bundesliga]] games were involved, the matches in question do include a DFB Cup first-round contest between regional side [[SC Paderborn 07|Paderborn]] and Bundesliga heavyweights [[Hamburger SV|Hamburg]] played on 21 August 2004. Hamburg lost 2\u20134 as two highly questionable penalties were awarded to Paderborn and Hamburg footballer [[\u00c9mile Mpenza]] was sent off for protesting as the club was eliminated from the lucrative competition.\n\n==Overview==\nFour referees \u2013 Lutz Michael Fr\u00f6hlich, Olaf Blumenstein, Manuel Gr\u00e4fe, and Felix Zwayer \u2013 went to officials of the [[German Football Association]] (Deutscher Fu\u00dfball-Bund, DFB) with their suspicions about Hoyzer. Initially, the DFB did not immediately act, but after becoming aware of the accusations, Hoyzer stepped down from his role as a referee.\n\nIndications are that Hoyzer had regular meetings in Berlin with a group of three brothers who were part of a [[Croatia]]n gambling syndicate connected to an organized crime group. After a confession from Hoyzer, several suspects were put under surveillance and on 28 January 2005 a number of people were arrested. Milan \u0160apina, operator of the ''Caf\u00e9 King'' sports betting agency and his brother Philip were taken into custody, along with [[Hertha BSC]] players [[Alexander Madlung]], [[Nando Rafael]] and [[Josip \u0160imuni\u0107]]. Madlung, Rafael, and \u0160imuni\u0107 all played in Hertha's surprising 3\u20132 defeat to third-division side [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] in their 22 September 2004 German Cup match, with Madlung giving up a crucial 80th minute own goal, only four minutes after coming on as a substitute. The trio came under suspicion for having been known to associate with the \u0160apina brothers, but there has been no proof that they actually participated in the manipulation of this or any other match.\n\nAs witnesses against Hoyzer, the [[Berlin]] referees [[Lutz Michael Fr\u00f6hlich]] and [[Manuel Gr\u00e4fe]] were immediately relieved of their officiating responsibilities for their own safety, being replaced by Franz-Xaver Wack and Torsten Kinh\u00f6fer. The referees scheduled to officiate matches in the 19th round of Bundesliga play on 29 and 30 January 2005 were all changed the day before the games were played.\n\nHoyzer co-operated with investigators in helping to uncover the details of the scheme, implicating other officials, players, and a group of Croatian-based gamblers.

Castles of the World. Metro Books, 2013, p. 167. {{ISBN|978-1-4351-4845-1}}</ref> The original design was a basic [[Motte and Bailey|bailey]] with a wooden wall. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the archbishops of Salzburg were already powerful political figures and they expanded the fortress to protect their interests. Helfenstein's conflict with Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] during the [[Investiture Controversy]] influenced the expansion of the fortress, with the Archbishop taking the side of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and the German anti-king [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]]. The fortress was gradually expanded during the following centuries. The ring walls and towers were built in 1462 under Prince-Archbishop [[Burkhard Weisbriach|Burkhard II von Wei\u00dfpriach]].\n\nPrince-Archbishop [[Leonhard von Keutschach]] further expanded the fortress during his term from 1495 until 1519.<ref name=\"auto\">de Fabianis, p. 168.</ref> His coadjutor [[Matth\u00e4us Lang von Wellenburg]], who was later to succeed Leonhard, in 1515 wrote a description of the [[Reisszug]], a very early and primitive [[funicular|funicular railway]] that provided freight access to the upper courtyard of the fortress. The line still exists, albeit in updated form, and is probably the oldest operational [[rail transport|railway]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news|first=Reinhard |last=Kriechbaum |url=http://www.die-tagespost.de/Archiv/titel_anzeige.asp?ID=8916 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120628225245/http://www.die-tagespost.de/Archiv/titel_anzeige.asp?ID=8916 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-06-28 |title=Die gro\u00dfe Reise auf den Berg |work=der Tagespost |date=2004-05-15 |accessdate=2009-04-22 |language=German }}</ref><ref name=fm1>{{cite web | url = http://www.funimag.com/funimag10/RESZUG01.HTM | title = Der Reiszug - Part 1 - Presentation | publisher = Funimag | accessdate = 2009-04-22}}</ref> The current external bastions, begun in the 16th century and completed in the 17th, were added as a precaution because of fears of Turkish Invasion.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe only time that the fortress actually came under siege was during the [[German Peasants' War]] in 1525, when a group of miners, farmers and townspeople tried to oust Prince-Archbishop Matth\u00e4us Lang, but failed to take the fortress. In 1617 the deposed Archbishop [[Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau]] died in the fortress prison. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], Archbishop Count Paris of Lodron strengthened the town's defenses, including Hohensalzburg. He added various parts to the fortress, such as the gunpowder stores and additional gatehouses. The fortress was surrendered without a fight to [[French First Republic|French]] troops under General [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]] during the Napoleonic [[War of the Second Coalition]] in 1800 and the last Prince-Archbishop [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo]] fled to [[Vienna]]. In the 19th century, it was used as barracks, storage depot and dungeon before being abandoned as a military outpost in 1861.\n\n===Recent history===\n{{Hohensalzburg Fortress}}\nHohensalzburg Fortress was refurbished from the late 19th century onwards and became a major tourist attraction with the [[Festungsbahn (Salzburg)|Festungsbahn]] funicular railway, opened in 1892,<ref name=\"auto\"/> leading up from the town to the Hasengrabenbastei. It stands today as one of the best preserved castles in Europe.\n\nDuring the early 20th century it was used as a prison, holding Italian prisoners of war during [[World War I]] and Nazi activists before Germany's annexation of Austria in March 1938.\n\nGerman ceramicist, sculptor and painter [[Arno Lehmann]] lived and created in Hohensalzburg Fortress from 1949 until his death in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salzburgmuseum.at/index.php?id=161|title=Arno Lehmann (1905-1973) - Keramiker, Maler, Bildhauer|last=Vaelske|first=Urd|website=Salzburg Museum|publisher=Salzburger Museum Carolino-Augusteum|year=2007|access-date=February 6, 2018|language=de}}</ref>\n\nHohensalzburg Fortress was selected as main motif for the Austrian [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins European Union (Austria)#2006 coinage|Nonnberg Abbey commemorative coin]] minted on April 5, 2006. This was the first coin of the series \"Great Abbeys of Austria\".  It shows the Benedictine convent of [[Nonnberg Abbey]]. In the hilltop on the background, the  fortress and the Kajetaner church can be seen. Also in 1977 the Austrian Mint issued a coin for the 900th anniversary of Hohensalzburg Fortress.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Interior ==\n[[File:Hohensalzburg Castle 43.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Inner courtyard towards the ''Hohe Stock'' and St. George's Chapel]]\nThe fortress consists of various wings and courtyard. The Prince-Bishop's apartments are located in the so-called \"Hoher Stock\" (high floor).\n\n=== Salzburg Bull ===\nThe ''Krautturm'' (powder tower) houses a large [[aerophon]] of more than 200 pipes which is called the \"Salzburg Bull\" (''Salzburger Stier''). This huge mechanical organ was built in 1502 by Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach. It was renewed by Rochus Egedacher in 1735.\n\nFrom Palm Sunday to 31 October the \"Salzburg Bull\" is played daily at 7, 11 and 18 o'clock. The aerophone thus initiated the playing of the carillon at the Residenzplatz and ended it again.\n\nOne of Austria's most famous cabaret groups is named after it.\n\n=== Golden Hall ===\nStarting in 1498, Archbishop [[Leonhard von Keutschach]] had the magnificent state apartments installed on the third floor. The rooms in which the archbishops would normally have lived were one floor below. The state apartments were primarily used for representative purposes and for festivities. The Golden Hall was richly decorated and indicates that the fortress served the archbishops not only as a refuge in times of crisis, but frequently also as a residence up to the 16th century.\n\nIn order to gain more space, Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach had four massive marble pillars constructed on the right-hand outer wall and had a [[loggia]] added on. As in the other rooms the ceiling is coffered, each coffer being adorned with gold buttons symbolising the stars in the sky.\n\nThe 17-metre-long [[Beam (structure)|beam]], supporting the ceiling, is particularly worth mentioning. The coat of arms of Leonhard von Keutschach together with those of the Holy Roman Empire, the most powerful German towns and the bishoprics that were connected to Salzburg, are painted on it.\n\n=== Chapel of Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach ===\n[[File:Salzburg Festung hohensalzburg 04.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Chapel of archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach]]\nArchbishop Leonhard von Keutschach (1495-1519) had the chapel built at a later time. One of the figure consoles in the beam ceiling had to be removed to make room for it. A richly ornamented star vault decorates the ceiling of the chapel. The inner part of the door at the entrance is covered with stucco. The painted frame shows red columns on a high plinth with grey capitals. The coat of arms of Salzburg and of Leonhard von Keutschach is reproduced in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] beneath the [[mitre]], legate cross and sword. A special feature of the coat of arms is the [[turnip]] and in many places in the fortress this can be found as an indication of prince-archbishop Keutschach's building activity. In the north wall of the chapel there are two openings which made it possible to attend the church service from the side room.\n\n=== Golden Chamber ===\nThe Golden Chamber is the most magnificently furnished room of the princely chambers. The two long walls are taken up by benches that are richly decorated with vines, grapes, foliage and animals. These benches used to be covered with cloth or leather, but the upholstery has not survived into the modern age. The walls also used to be covered in gold-embossed leather tapestry which adorned the lower part of the wall.\n\n=== Bedchamber ===\nThe bedchamber is the most intimate room of the princely chambers. The original furniture and precious textiles, such as tapestry, were in the course of time replaced by more \"modern\" ones. The elaborate [[wainscoting]] to keep out the cold still bears witness to the splendour of the past. The upper part of the panels is decorated with gilded buttons and [[Rosette (design)|rosettes]], whereas the lower part, which is bare today, was probably covered with leather or velvet tapestry. The door conceals a toilet, which is basically a hole in the floor with a wooden frame. Back in the past this was a highly modern sanitary facility and was accessible from each floor.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:SalzburgVonDerGersbergalm.jpg|Hohensalzburg Fortress and Salzburg, view from \"Gersberg Alm\"\nFile:12-10-31-salzburg-by-RalfR-01.jpg|Hohensalzburg Fortress at night\nFile:Hohensalzburg Castle 39.jpg|Golden Chamber\nFile:Hohensalzburg Castle 42.jpg|Bedchamber of the Prince-Bishop\nFile:View of Salzburg from Modern Museum.jpg|Hohensalzburg viewed from the Museum of Modern Art. \n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alte Residenz]]\n* [[Hohenwerfen Castle]]\n* [[Salzburg Cathedral]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat|Festung Hohensalzburg|Hohensalzburg Castle}}\n* [https://www.salzburg-burgen.at/en/hohensalzburg-castle/ Hohensalzburg Fortress]\n* [http://allnumis.com/coin/austria/100-schilling-1977-the-900-anniversary-of-the-hohensalzburg-castle-1334 Hohensalzburg Castle 900th anniversary coin]\n* [https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/top10/hohensalzburg-fortress Salzburg Tourist Office]\n* {{burgen-austria|id=1174|name=Hohensalzburg}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJAfrPRgnEA Digital reconstruction of the castle] through time\n\n{{coord|47|47|42|N|13|02|50|E|region:AT_type:landmark|display=title}}{{Castles in Austria}}{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Castles in Salzburg]]\n[[Category:11th-century establishments in Austria]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Salzburg]]\n[[Category:Museums in Salzburg]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Austria]]\n[[Category:Military and war museums in Austria]]\n", "text_old": "{{For|the castle in Bavaria, Germany|Salzburg Castle}}\n{{Infobox building\n|name                = Hohensalzburg Fortress\n|native_name         = {{lang-de|Festung Hohensalzburg}}\n|alternate_names     = \n|image               = Hohensalzburg Castle.jpg\n|caption             = Hohensalzburg Fortress\n|map_type            = Austria\n|altitude            = \n|building_type       = [[Fortress]]\n|architectural_style = \n|structural_system=\n|location            = Salzburg\n|address             = \n|client=\n|owner               = \n|current_tenants= \n|landlord= \n|location_country    = Austria\n|coordinates         = {{coord|47|47|42|N|13|02|50|E|display=inline}}\n|start_date          = 1077\n|completion_date=\n|inauguration_date=\n|renovation_date=\n|height=\n|diameter=\n|other_dimensions=\n|floor_count=\n|floor_area=\n|references=\n}}\n'''Hohensalzburg Fortress''' ({{lang-de|Festung Hohensalzburg|lit=High Salzburg Fortress}}) sits atop the [[Festungsberg]], a small hill in the [[Austria]]n city of [[Salzburg]].

Castles of the World. Metro Books, 2013, p. 167. {{ISBN|978-1-4351-4845-1}}</ref> The original design was a basic [[Motte and Bailey|bailey]] with a wooden wall. In the [[Holy Roman Empire]], the archbishops of Salzburg were already powerful political figures and they expanded the fortress to protect their interests. Helfenstein's conflict with Emperor [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry IV]] during the [[Investiture Controversy]] influenced the expansion of the fortress, with the Archbishop taking the side of [[Pope Gregory VII]] and the German anti-king [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]]. The fortress was gradually expanded during the following centuries. The ring walls and towers were built in 1462 under Prince-Archbishop [[Burkhard Weisbriach|Burkhard II von Wei\u00dfpriach]].\n\nPrince-Archbishop [[Leonhard von Keutschach]] further expanded the fortress during his term from 1495 until 1519.<ref name=\"auto\">de Fabianis, p. 168.</ref> His coadjutor [[Matth\u00e4us Lang von Wellenburg]], who was later to succeed Leonhard, in 1515 wrote a description of the [[Reisszug]], a very early and primitive [[funicular|funicular railway]] that provided freight access to the upper courtyard of the fortress. The line still exists, albeit in updated form, and is probably the oldest operational [[rail transport|railway]] in the world.<ref>{{cite news|first=Reinhard |last=Kriechbaum |url=http://www.die-tagespost.de/Archiv/titel_anzeige.asp?ID=8916 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120628225245/http://www.die-tagespost.de/Archiv/titel_anzeige.asp?ID=8916 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-06-28 |title=Die gro\u00dfe Reise auf den Berg |work=der Tagespost |date=2004-05-15 |accessdate=2009-04-22 |language=German }}</ref><ref name=fm1>{{cite web | url = http://www.funimag.com/funimag10/RESZUG01.HTM | title = Der Reiszug - Part 1 - Presentation | publisher = Funimag | accessdate = 2009-04-22}}</ref> The current external bastions, begun in the 16th century and completed in the 17th, were added as a precaution because of fears of Turkish Invasion.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nThe only time that the fortress actually came under siege was during the [[German Peasants' War]] in 1525, when a group of miners, farmers and townspeople tried to oust Prince-Archbishop Matth\u00e4us Lang, but failed to take the fortress. In 1617 the deposed Archbishop [[Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau]] died in the fortress prison. During the [[Thirty Years' War]], Archbishop Count Paris of Lodron strengthened the town's defenses, including Hohensalzburg. He added various parts to the fortress, such as the gunpowder stores and additional gatehouses. The fortress was surrendered without a fight to [[French First Republic|French]] troops under General [[Jean Victor Marie Moreau]] during the Napoleonic [[War of the Second Coalition]] in 1800 and the last Prince-Archbishop [[Count Hieronymus von Colloredo]] fled to [[Vienna]]. In the 19th century, it was used as barracks, storage depot and dungeon before being abandoned as a military outpost in 1861.\n\n===Recent history===\n{{Hohensalzburg Fortress}}\nHohensalzburg Fortress was refurbished from the late 19th century onwards and became a major tourist attraction with the [[Festungsbahn (Salzburg)|Festungsbahn]] funicular railway, opened in 1892,<ref name=\"auto\"/> leading up from the town to the Hasengrabenbastei. It stands today as one of the best preserved castles in Europe.\n\nDuring the early 20th century it was used as a prison, holding Italian prisoners of war during [[World War I]] and Nazi activists before Germany's annexation of Austria in March 1938.\n\nGerman ceramicist, sculptor and painter [[Arno Lehmann]] lived and created in Hohensalzburg Fortress from 1949 until his death in 1973.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salzburgmuseum.at/index.php?id=161|title=Arno Lehmann (1905-1973) - Keramiker, Maler, Bildhauer|last=Vaelske|first=Urd|website=Salzburg Museum|publisher=Salzburger Museum Carolino-Augusteum|year=2007|access-date=February 6, 2018|language=de}}</ref>\n\nHohensalzburg Fortress was selected as main motif for the Austrian [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins European Union (Austria)#2006 coinage|Nonnberg Abbey commemorative coin]] minted on April 5, 2006. This was the first coin of the series \"Great Abbeys of Austria\".  It shows the Benedictine convent of [[Nonnberg Abbey]]. In the hilltop on the background, the  fortress and the Kajetaner church can be seen. Also in 1977 the Austrian Mint issued a coin for the 900th anniversary of Hohensalzburg Fortress.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Interior ==\n[[File:Hohensalzburg Castle 43.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Inner courtyard towards the ''Hohe Stock'' and St. George's Chapel]]\nThe fortress consists of various wings and courtyard. The Prince-Bishop's apartments are located in the so-called \"Hoher Stock\" (high floor).\n\n=== Salzburg Bull ===\nThe ''Krautturm'' (powder tower) houses a large [[aerophon]] of more than 200 pipes which is called the \"Salzburg Bull\" (''Salzburger Stier''). This huge mechanical organ was built in 1502 by Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach. It was renewed by Rochus Egedacher in 1735.\n\nFrom Palm Sunday to 31 October the \"Salzburg Bull\" is played daily at 7, 11 and 18 o'clock. The aerophone thus initiated the playing of the carillon at the Residenzplatz and ended it again.\n\nOne of Austria's most famous cabaret groups is named after it.\n\n=== Golden Hall ===\nStarting in 1498, Archbishop [[Leonhard von Keutschach]] had the magnificent state apartments installed on the third floor. The rooms in which the archbishops would normally have lived were one floor below. The state apartments were primarily used for representative purposes and for festivities. The Golden Hall was richly decorated and indicates that the fortress served the archbishops not only as a refuge in times of crisis, but frequently also as a residence up to the 16th century.\n\nIn order to gain more space, Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach had four massive marble pillars constructed on the right-hand outer wall and had a [[loggia]] added on. As in the other rooms the ceiling is coffered, each coffer being adorned with gold buttons symbolising the stars in the sky.\n\nThe 17-metre-long [[Beam (structure)|beam]], supporting the ceiling, is particularly worth mentioning. The coat of arms of Leonhard von Keutschach together with those of the Holy Roman Empire, the most powerful German towns and the bishoprics that were connected to Salzburg, are painted on it.\n\n=== Chapel of Archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach ===\n[[File:Salzburg Festung hohensalzburg 04.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Chapel of archbishop Leonhard von Keutschach]]\nArchbishop Leonhard von Keutschach (1495-1519) had the chapel built at a later time. One of the figure consoles in the beam ceiling had to be removed to make room for it. A richly ornamented star vault decorates the ceiling of the chapel. The inner part of the door at the entrance is covered with stucco. The painted frame shows red columns on a high plinth with grey capitals. The coat of arms of Salzburg and of Leonhard von Keutschach is reproduced in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] beneath the [[mitre]], legate cross and sword. A special feature of the coat of arms is the [[turnip]] and in many places in the fortress this can be found as an indication of prince-archbishop Keutschach's building activity. In the north wall of the chapel there are two openings which made it possible to attend the church service from the side room.\n\n=== Golden Chamber ===\nThe Golden Chamber is the most magnificently furnished room of the princely chambers. The two long walls are taken up by benches that are richly decorated with vines, grapes, foliage and animals. These benches used to be covered with cloth or leather, but the upholstery has not survived into the modern age. The walls also used to be covered in gold-embossed leather tapestry which adorned the lower part of the wall.\n\n=== Bedchamber ===\nThe bedchamber is the most intimate room of the princely chambers. The original furniture and precious textiles, such as tapestry, were in the course of time replaced by more \"modern\" ones. The elaborate [[wainscoting]] to keep out the cold still bears witness to the splendour of the past. The upper part of the panels is decorated with gilded buttons and [[Rosette (design)|rosettes]], whereas the lower part, which is bare today, was probably covered with leather or velvet tapestry. The door conceals a toilet, which is basically a hole in the floor with a wooden frame. Back in the past this was a highly modern sanitary facility and was accessible from each floor.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Gallery ==\n<gallery>\nFile:SalzburgVonDerGersbergalm.jpg|Hohensalzburg Fortress and Salzburg, view from \"Gersberg Alm\"\nFile:12-10-31-salzburg-by-RalfR-01.jpg|Hohensalzburg Fortress at night\nFile:Hohensalzburg Castle 39.jpg|Golden Chamber\nFile:Hohensalzburg Castle 42.jpg|Bedchamber of the Prince-Bishop\nFile:View of Salzburg from Modern Museum.jpg|Hohensalzburg viewed from the Museum of Modern Art. \n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Alte Residenz]]\n* [[Hohenwerfen Castle]]\n* [[Salzburg Cathedral]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{commonscat|Festung Hohensalzburg|Hohensalzburg Castle}}\n* [https://www.salzburg-burgen.at/en/hohensalzburg-castle/ Hohensalzburg Fortress]\n* [http://allnumis.com/coin/austria/100-schilling-1977-the-900-anniversary-of-the-hohensalzburg-castle-1334 Hohensalzburg Castle 900th anniversary coin]\n* [https://www.salzburg.info/en/sights/top10/hohensalzburg-fortress Salzburg Tourist Office]\n* {{burgen-austria|id=1174|name=Hohensalzburg}}\n* [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJAfrPRgnEA&t=139s Digital reconstruction of the castle] through time\n\n{{coord|47|47|42|N|13|02|50|E|region:AT_type:landmark|display=title}}{{Castles in Austria}}{{Authority control}}\n[[Category:Castles in Salzburg]]\n[[Category:11th-century establishments in Austria]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Salzburg]]\n[[Category:Museums in Salzburg]]\n[[Category:Historic house museums in Austria]]\n[[Category:Military and war museums in Austria]]\n", "name_user": "Richard Nevell", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:remove extra bit of code", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hohensalzburg_Fortress"}
