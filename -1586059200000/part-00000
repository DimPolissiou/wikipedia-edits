{"title_page": "Topological fluid dynamics", "text_new": "Topological ideas are relevant to [[fluid dynamics]] (including [[magnetohydrodynamics]]) at the [[kinematic]] level, since any fluid flow involves continuous deformation of any transported scalar or vector field. Problems of  stirring and mixing are particularly susceptible to topological techniques. Thus, for example, the [[Nielsen\u2013Thurston classification|Thurston\u2013Nielsen classification]] has been fruitfully applied to the problem of stirring in two-dimensions by any number of stirrers following a time-periodic 'stirring protocol' (Boyland, Aref & Stremler 2000). Other studies are concerned with flows having chaotic particle paths, and associated exponential rates of mixing (Ottino 1989).\n\nAt the dynamic level, the fact that vortex lines are transported by any flow governed by the classical [[Euler equations]] implies conservation of any vortical structure within the flow. Such structures are characterised at least in part by the [[Helicity (fluid mechanics)|helicity]] of certain sub-regions of the flow field, a topological invariant of the equations. Helicity plays a central role in [[dynamo theory]], the theory of spontaneous generation of magnetic fields in stars and planets (Moffatt 1978, Parker 1979, Krause & R\u00e4dler 1980). It is known that, with few exceptions, any statistically homogeneous turbulent flow having nonzero mean helicity in a sufficiently large expanse of conducting fluid will generate a large-scale magnetic field through dynamo action. Such fields themselves exhibit [[magnetic helicity]], reflecting their own topologically nontrivial structure.\n\nMuch interest attaches to the determination of states of minimum energy, subject to prescribed topology. Many problems of fluid dynamics and [[magnetohydrodynamics]] fall within this category. Recent developments in topological fluid dynamics include also applications to magnetic [[Braid theory|braids]] in the [[solar corona]], DNA knotting by [[topoisomerases]], polymer entanglement in chemical physics and chaotic behavior in dynamical systems. A mathematical introduction to this subject is given by Arnold & Khesin (1998) and recent survey articles and contributions may be found in Ricca (2009), and Moffatt, Bajer & Kimura (2013).\n\nTopology is also crucial to the structure of [[Neutral density|neutral surfaces]] in a fluid (such as the ocean) where the equation of state nonlinearly depends on multiple components (e.g. salinity and heat). Fluid parcels remain neutrally [[buoyancy|buoyant]] as they move along neutral surfaces, despite variations in salinity or heat.  On such surfaces, the salinity and heat are functionally related, but this function is [[Multivalued function|multivalued]]. The spatial regions within which this function becomes single-valued are those where there is at most one [[Contour line|contour]] of salinity (or heat) per isovalue, which are precisely the regions associated with each edge of the [[Reeb graph]] of the salinity (or heat) on the surface (Stanley 2019).\n\n==References==\n\n*[[Vladimir Arnold|Arnold, V.

No scientific evidence suggests that the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, as originally designed or revised in 1993, will reduce substance use in the absence of continued instruction more focused on social competency development. Any consideration of the D.A.R.E.'s potential as a drug prevention strategy should place D.A.R.E. in the context of instructional strategies in general. No instructional program is likely to have a dramatic effect on substance use. Estimates of the effect sizes of even the strongest of these programs are typically in the mid- to high-teens. D.A.R.E.'s meager effects place it at the bottom of the distribution of effect sizes, but none of the effects are large enough to justify their use as the centerpiece of a drug prevention strategy.

The U.S. Department of Education came close to creating such a Fairy Godmother when it required school districts to choose drug abuse prevention programs only if their effectiveness was supported by \"scientific\" evidence. The experience showed advantages of such a procedure (e.g., reduction in support for D.A.R.E., which evaluation had found wanting) but also shortcomings (limited and in some cases questionable evaluation evidence in support of other programs). Federal procedures for identifying successful programs appeared biased. In addition, the Fairy Godmother discounted the professional judgment of local educators and did little to improve the fit of programs to local conditions. Nevertheless, giving evaluation more clout is a worthwhile way to increase the rationality of decision making.

The programs (sic) content, [[teaching method]]s, and use of uniformed police officers rather than teachers might each explain its weak evaluations. No scientific evidence suggests that the D.A.R.E. core curriculum, as originally designed or revised in 1993, will reduce substance use in the absence of continued instruction more focused on social competency development. Any consideration of the D.A.R.E.'s potential as a drug prevention strategy should place D.A.R.E. in the context of instructional strategies in general. No instructional program is likely to have a dramatic effect on substance use. Estimates of the effect sizes of even the strongest of these programs are typically in the mid- to high-teens. D.A.R.E.'s meager effects place it at the bottom of the distribution of effect sizes, but none of the effects are large enough to justify their use as the centerpiece of a drug prevention strategy.

The U.S. Department of Education came close to creating such a Fairy Godmother when it required school districts to choose drug abuse prevention programs only if their effectiveness was supported by \"scientific\" evidence. The experience showed advantages of such a procedure (e.g., reduction in support for D.A.R.E., which evaluation had found wanting) but also shortcomings (limited and in some cases questionable evaluation evidence in support of other programs). Federal procedures for identifying successful programs appeared biased. In addition, the Fairy Godmother discounted the professional judgment of local educators and did little to improve the fit of programs to local conditions. Nevertheless, giving evaluation more clout is a worthwhile way to increase the rationality of decision making.

The album was released on September 25, 2007 through [[Geffen Records]]. It was nominated for [[Best Contemporary R&B Album]] at the [[50th Annual Grammy Awards]] that was held February 2008, but it lost to [[Ne-Yo]]'s ''[[Because of You (Ne-Yo album)|Because of You]]''. As of December 2007, the album has been certified [[RIAA certifications|platinum]] in sales by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] and remains Cole's highest-selling album to date with 1.7 million copies sold.\n\n==Conception==\nCole started work on her second album shortly after the release of her debut album, ''[[The Way It Is (Keyshia Cole album)|The Way It Is]]''. About the album, Cole says, \"This album is more about you, inside, and how you need to get yourself together, rather than pointing at somebody else and saying, 'You don't treat me right, you don't do this.' I'm truly lovin it, I listen to it myself. The last album, I didn't really listen to until I went on tour. [Because] when you listen to your own experience, it's like, I don't wanna hear it anymore.

Other emergency responders may also be trained.\n\nSome health professionals, or even lay rescuers, may be trained in [[basic life support]] (BLS), especially [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR), which makes up the core foundation of ACLS.<ref name=\"circ.ahajournals.org\">Berg RA, Hemphill R, Abella BS, Aufderheide TP, Cave DM, Hazinski MF, Lerner EB, Rea TD, Sayre MR, Swor RA. \"Part 5: Adult basic life support: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care\" ''Circulation'' 2010;122(suppl 3):S685\u2013S705. http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/122/18_suppl_3/S685</ref> When a [[sudden cardiac arrest]] occurs, immediate CPR is a vital link in the [[chain of survival]]. Another important link is early [[defibrillation]], which has improved greatly with the widespread availability of [[Automated external defibrillator|automated external defibrillators (AEDs)]].\n\n==Electrocardiogram interpretation==\nACLS often starts with analyzing the patient's heart rhythms with a manual defibrillator. In contrast to an [[Automated external defibrillator|AED]] in BLS, where the machine makes the determination as to when to defibrillate (shock) a patient, the ACLS team leader makes those decisions based on rhythms on the monitor and the patient's vital signs. The next steps in ACLS are insertion of intravenous (IV) lines and placement of various airway devices, such as an endotracheal tube (an advanced airway used in intubations). Commonly used ACLS drugs, such as [[epinephrine]] and [[amiodarone]], are then administered.<ref>NeumarRW, Otto CW, Link MS, Kronick SL, Shuster M, Callaway CW, Kudenchuk PJ, OrnatoJP, McNally B, Silvers SM, Passman RS, White RD, Hess EP, Tang W, Davis D, SinzE, Morrison LJ. \"Part 8: adult advanced cardiovascular life support: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care\" ''Circulation'' 2010; 122(suppl 3) S729\u2013S767.</ref> The ACLS personnel quickly search for possible reversible causes of cardiac arrest (i.e. the [[Hs and Ts|H's and T's]], [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]). Based on their diagnosis, more specific treatments are given. These treatments may be medical such as IV injection of an antidote for drug overdose, or surgical such as insertion of a [[chest tube]] for those with tension [[pneumothorax|pneumothoraces]] or [[hemothorax|hemothoraces]].\n\n==Guidelines==\nThe [[American Heart Association]] and the [[International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation]] performs a science review every five years and publishes an updated set of recommendations and educational materials. These guidelines are often synonymously referred to as [[Emergency Cardiovascular Care (ECC) Guidelines]]. Following are recent changes.\n\n=== 2015 guidelines ===\nThe 2015 ACLS guidelines promoted minor tweaks and improvements to the 2010 guidelines with no major changes.

Most institutions expect their staff to recertify at least every two years. Many sites offer training in simulation labs with simulated code situations with a dummy. Other hospitals accept software-based courses for recertification. An ''ACLS Provider Manual'' reflecting the new Guidelines is now available.\n\nStroke is also included in the ACLS course with emphasis on the stroke chain of survival.<ref>Jauch EC, Cucchiara B, Adeoye O, Meurer W, Brice J, Chan Y-F, Gentile N, Hazinski MF. \"Part 11: adult stroke: 2010 American Heart Association Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiovascular Care\" ''Circulation'' 2010;122(suppl 3):S818\u2013S828. http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/122/18_suppl_3/S818</ref>\n\n\n==Algorithms==\nThe current ACLS guidelines are set into several groups of \"[[algorithm]]s\" - a set of instructions that are followed to standardize treatment, and increase its effectiveness.
