The whole milk of the morning milking is mixed with the naturally skimmed milk (which is made by keeping milk in large shallow tanks to allow the cream to separate) of the previous evening's milking, resulting in a part skim mixture. This mixture is pumped into copper-lined vats, which heat evenly and contribute copper ions to the mix.<ref>Molly McDonough, \"Why Copper Vats Matter\", ''Culture: The Word on Cheese'' [https://culturecheesemag.com/cheese-iq/copper-vats-cheesemaking July 19, 2017]</ref>\n\n[[File:Parmigiano-Reggiano Factory.png|thumb|right|Copper-lined vats for the production of Parmigiano-Reggiano]]\nStarter [[whey]] (containing a mixture of certain [[thermophile|thermophilic]] [[lactic acid bacteria]]) is added, and the temperature is raised to 33\u201335&nbsp;\u00b0C (91\u201395&nbsp;\u00b0F). Calf [[rennet]] is added, and the mixture is left to curdle for 10\u201312 minutes. The curd is then broken up mechanically into small pieces (around the size of rice grains). The temperature is then raised to 55&nbsp;\u00b0C (131&nbsp;\u00b0F) with careful control by the cheese-maker. The curd is left to settle for 45\u201360 minutes. The compacted curd is collected in a piece of [[muslin]] before being divided in two and placed in molds. There is 1100 L (291 US gallons or 250 imperial gallons) of milk per vat, producing two cheeses each. The curd making up each [[truckle|wheel]] at this point weighs around 45&nbsp;kg (100&nbsp;lb). The remaining whey in the vat was traditionally used to feed the pigs from which ''Prosciutto di Parma'' ([[Prosciutto|cured Parma ham]]) was produced. The barns for these animals were usually just a few yards away from the cheese production rooms.\n\n[[File:Cracking a Parmesan Wheel-9MAR2013.ogv|thumb|right|Cracking open a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese]]\nThe cheese is put into a stainless steel, round form that is pulled tight with a spring-powered buckle so the cheese retains its wheel shape. After a day or two, the buckle is released and a plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the Parmigiano-Reggiano name, the plant's number, and month and year of production is put around the cheese and the metal form is buckled tight again. The imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about a day and the wheel is then put into a brine bath to absorb salt for 20\u201325 days. After brining, the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months. Each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be 24 cheeses high by 90 cheeses long or 2160 total wheels per aisle. Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned manually or robotically every seven days. The cheese is also turned at this time.\n\n[[File:parmigiano reggiano factory.jpg|thumb|A Parmigiano-Reggiano factory maturation room]]\n[[File:Parmigiano-Reggiano.png|thumb|Product process of Parmesan cheese]]\n\nAt 12 months, the Consorzio Parmigiano-Reggiano inspects every wheel. The cheese is tested by a master grader who taps each wheel to identify undesirable cracks and voids within the wheel. Wheels that pass the test are then heat branded on the rind with the Consorzio's logo. Those that do not pass the test used to have their rinds marked with lines or crosses all the way around to inform consumers that they are not getting top-quality Parmigiano-Reggiano; more recent practices simply have these lesser rinds stripped of all markings.\n\nTraditionally, cows have to be fed only on [[grass]] or [[hay]], producing [[grass fed]] [[milk]]. Only natural whey culture is allowed as a starter, together with calf rennet.<ref>\"[http://www.famigliagastaldello.it/a_52_IT_251_1.html Standard di Produzione] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513123536/http://www.famigliagastaldello.it/a_52_IT_251_1.html |date=2006-05-13 }}\".

Each wheel must meet strict criteria early in the aging process, when the cheese is still soft and creamy, to merit the official seal and be placed in storage for aging.

The whole milk of the morning milking is mixed with the naturally skimmed milk (which is made by keeping milk in large shallow tanks to allow the cream to separate) of the previous evening's milking, resulting in a part skim mixture. This mixture is pumped into copper-lined vats, which heat evenly and contribute copper ions to the mix.<ref>Molly McDonough, \"Why Copper Vats Matter\", ''Culture: The Word on Cheese'' [https://culturecheesemag.com/cheese-iq/copper-vats-cheesemaking July 19, 2017]</ref>\n\n[[File:Parmigiano-Reggiano Factory.png|thumb|right|Copper-lined vats for the production of Parmigiano-Reggiano]]\nStarter [[whey]] (containing a mixture of certain [[thermophile|thermophilic]] [[lactic acid bacteria]]) is added, and the temperature is raised to 33\u201335&nbsp;\u00b0C (91\u201395&nbsp;\u00b0F). Calf [[rennet]] is added, and the mixture is left to curdle for 10\u201312 minutes. The curd is then broken up mechanically into small pieces (around the size of rice grains). The temperature is then raised to 55&nbsp;\u00b0C (131&nbsp;\u00b0F) with careful control by the cheese-maker. The curd is left to settle for 45\u201360 minutes. The compacted curd is collected in a piece of [[muslin]] before being divided in two and placed in molds. There is 1100 L (291 US gallons or 250 imperial gallons) of milk per vat, producing two cheeses each. The curd making up each [[truckle|wheel]] at this point weighs around 45&nbsp;kg (100&nbsp;lb). The remaining whey in the vat was traditionally used to feed the pigs from which ''Prosciutto di Parma'' ([[Prosciutto|cured Parma ham]]) was produced. The barns for these animals were usually just a few yards away from the cheese production rooms.\n\n[[File:Cracking a Parmesan Wheel-9MAR2013.ogv|thumb|right|Cracking open a wheel of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese]]\nThe cheese is put into a stainless steel, round form that is pulled tight with a spring-powered buckle so the cheese retains its wheel shape. After a day or two, the buckle is released and a plastic belt imprinted numerous times with the Parmigiano-Reggiano name, the plant's number, and month and year of production is put around the cheese and the metal form is buckled tight again. The imprints take hold on the rind of the cheese in about a day and the wheel is then put into a brine bath to absorb salt for 20\u201325 days. After brining, the wheels are then transferred to the aging rooms in the plant for 12 months. Each cheese is placed on wooden shelves that can be 24 cheeses high by 90 cheeses long or 2160 total wheels per aisle. Each cheese and the shelf underneath it is then cleaned manually or robotically every seven days. The cheese is also turned at this time.\n\n[[File:parmigiano reggiano factory.jpg|thumb|A Parmigiano-Reggiano factory maturation room]]\n[[File:Parmigiano-Reggiano.png|thumb|Product process of Parmesan cheese]]\n\nAt 12 months, the Consorzio Parmigiano-Reggiano inspects every wheel. The cheese is tested by a master grader who taps each wheel to identify undesirable cracks and voids within the wheel. Wheels that pass the test are then heat branded on the rind with the Consorzio's logo. Those that do not pass the test used to have their rinds marked with lines or crosses all the way around to inform consumers that they are not getting top-quality Parmigiano-Reggiano; more recent practices simply have these lesser rinds stripped of all markings.\n\nTraditionally, cows have to be fed only on [[grass]] or [[hay]], producing [[grass fed]] [[milk]]. Only natural whey culture is allowed as a starter, together with calf rennet.<ref>\"[http://www.famigliagastaldello.it/a_52_IT_251_1.html Standard di Produzione] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060513123536/http://www.famigliagastaldello.it/a_52_IT_251_1.html |date=2006-05-13 }}\".

First was the  [[Chongqing\u2013Huaihua Railway]], completed in 2005. Its Fuling Railway Station is located a few kilometers west of town ({{coord|29|42|10|N|107|19|45|E|display=inline|region:CN-62_type:landmark}}).\n\nThe high-speed [[Chongqing\u2212Lichuan Railway]], opened on December 28, 2013, serves Fuling as well, with its Fuling North Railway Station. This railway crosses the Yangtze near the city over the [[Hanjiatuo Bridge]]. The railway's [[Caijiagou Bridge]] ({{zh|labels=no|s=\u8521\u5bb6\u6c9f\u7279\u5927\u6865}}; {{coord|29|46|17|N|107|22|07|E}}), located in Fuling District, is said to be the world's tallest railway bridge, as measured by the height of the bridge's tallest pillar (139 m).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cd.qq.com/a/20120826/000005.htm |script-title=zh:\u6e1d\u5229\u94c1\u8def139\u7c73\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u9ad8 \u6210\u90fd\u5230\u4e0a\u6d77\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed |work=[[QQ.com]] |date=2012-08-26 |language=zh-cn}}</ref>  The [[Nanchuan\u2013Fuling Railway]], completed in 2012, forms part of Chongqing's outer railway ring.\n\nAs of 2015, Fuling had five [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|Yangtze River bridges]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Yangtze Normal Universitymaingate.jpg|thumb|[[Yangtze Normal University]]]]\n[[Yangtze Normal University]] (formerly Fuling Teachers College) is in Fuling.\n\n==Culture==\nThe [[White Crane Ridge]] (Baiheliang), a rock outcrop on the Yangtze River, has been used as a [[hydrological station]] recording water levels since the Tang Dynasty.

In the middle [[Warring States period]], it was part of the [[State of Chu]]. It was called the County of Zhi ({{lang|zh-hans|\u67b3\u53bf}}) in 277 by the [[State of Qin]]. In 347 (during the [[Eastern Jin Dynasty]]), it became the Commandery of Fu ({{lang|zh|\u6daa\u90e1}}), also known as Commandery of Zicheng ({{lang|zh|\u6893\u57ce\u90e1}}). It became County of Fuling ({{lang|zh-hans|\u6daa\u9675\u53bf}}) in the [[Sui Dynasty]]. It was Fu Prefecture ({{lang|zh|\u6daa\u5dde}}) in 618 (during the [[Tang Dynasty]]). From the [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan]] to the [[Qing Dynasty]], Fu Department was part of Chongqing Prefecture ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u5e9c}}}}).  In the early years of the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]], Fuling County was a part of Dongchuan [[Circuit (political division)|Circuit]] ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4e1c\u5ddd}}) until 1928 it became part of [[Sichuan]] province.\n\nIn January 1950, Fuling ''Zhuanqu'' of Chuandong include the seven counties of:\n\n* Fuling\n* [[Nanchuan District|Nanchuan]]\n* [[Fengdu County|Fengdu]]\n* [[Shizhu County|Shizhu]]\n* [[Wulong County|Wulong]]\n* [[Pengshui County|Pengshui]]\n* [[Changshou District|Changshou]]\n\nIn September 1952, Youyang ''Zhuanqu'' was abolished, and its counties of [[Qianjiang District|Qianjiang]], [[Youyang County|Youyang]], and [[Xiushan County|Xiushan]] were incorporated into Fuling ''Zhuanqu''.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The following year, [[Dianjiang County]] was also assigned to Fuling. Fuling's [[Changshou District|Changshou]] became under Chongqing City in 1958. The ''zhuanqu'' was made a [[prefecture (China)|prefecture]] in 1968.\n\nFuling County was upgraded to a [[county-level city]] in 1983.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} The prefecture became a [[Three Gorges]] provincial planning region ({{lang|zh-hans|\u4e09\u5ce1\u7701\u7b79\u5907\u533a\u57df}}) the following year. In 1988, the counties of Qianjiang, Youyang, Shizhu, Xiushan, and Pengshui were separated into new prefecture of their own (Qianjiang Prefecture).\n\nOn November 5, 1995, Fuling Prefecture and the original county-level city were abolished.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In the replace of the prefecture was the prefectural Fuling City, administer the three counties of Dianjiang, Wulong, and Fengdu, and Nanchuan City. It also includes the newly established districts of Zhicheng and Lidu ({{lang|zh-hans|\u67b3\u57ce}} and {{lang|zh|\u674e\u6e21}}).\n\nThe city was administered by Chongqing since September 1996 on behalf of the province, and became part of Chongqing Municipality the following year.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} In June 1998, Fuling city and its two districts were abolished. The districts became Fuling District. The remaining subdivisions of the Fuling City persisted, but were directly governed by Chongqing.\n\n==Climate==\nFuling District has a [[monsoon]]-influenced [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Cwa''), with four distinct seasons and ample rainfall: winters are short, mild, and comparatively dry, while summers are long, hot, and humid.

When imbibing large amounts of alcohol many people became so sick and they could not drink heavily all the time. Therefore, according to Hessler, consumption of alcohol was not habitual but instead was a ritual, and therefore drinking patterns were \"abusive with light consequences.\"<ref>[[Peter Hessler|Hessler]], p. 80.</ref>\n\n==Administrative divisions==\nThere are eight sub-districts, 18 towns, and 14 townships.

First was the  [[Chongqing\u2013Huaihua Railway]], completed in 2005. Its Fuling Railway Station is located a few kilometers west of town ({{coord|29|42|10|N|107|19|45|E|display=inline|region:CN-62_type:landmark}}).\n\nThe high-speed [[Chongqing\u2212Lichuan Railway]], opened on December 28, 2013, serves Fuling as well, with its Fuling North Railway Station. This railway crosses the Yangtze near the city over the [[Hanjiatuo Bridge]]. The railway's [[Caijiagou Bridge]] (\u8521\u5bb6\u6c9f\u7279\u5927\u6865; {{coord|29|46|17|N|107|22|07|E}}), located in Fuling District, is said to be the world's tallest railway bridge, as measured by the height of the bridge's tallest pillar (139 m).<ref>[http://cd.qq.com/a/20120826/000005.htm \u6e1d\u5229\u94c1\u8def139\u7c73\u4e16\u754c\u6700\u9ad8 \u6210\u90fd\u5230\u4e0a\u6d77\u65f6\u95f4\u7f29\u77ed] (Yu-Li Railway's world's highest 139 m [pillar]; will shorten Chengdu-Shanghai travel time), 2012-08-26 {{in lang|zh}}</ref>  The [[Nanchuan\u2013Fuling Railway]], completed in 2012, forms part of Chongqing's outer railway ring.\n\nAs of 2015, Fuling had five [[Yangtze River bridges and tunnels|Yangtze River bridges]].{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n==Education==\n[[File:Yangtze Normal Universitymaingate.jpg|thumb|[[Yangtze Normal University]]]]\n[[Yangtze Normal University]] (formerly Fuling Teachers College) is in Fuling.\n\n==Culture==\nThe [[White Crane Ridge]] (Baiheliang), a rock outcrop on the Yangtze River, has been used as a [[hydrological station]] recording water levels since the Tang Dynasty. It includes many rock carvings. With the flooding of the Yangtze as part of the Three Gorges Dam project, the [[White Crane Ridge Underwater Museum]] was opened in 2009 to protect the carvings and allow viewing by visitors under the new water level of the river.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2013/03/fuling-china/hessler-text | title=Fuling, China: Return to River Town | first=Peter | last=Hessler | authorlink=Peter Hessler | work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] | date=March 2013 | accessdate=24 September 2014 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*''[[River Town: Two Years on the Yangtze]]''\n*[[Fuling Catholic Church]]\n*[[White Crane Ridge]]\n*[[Baiheliang Underwater Museum]]\n*[[Project 816]]\n{{Portal|China}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Peter Hessler|Hessler, Peter]].

Some people stay on top of the ''Rath'' to distribute prasad (holy fruits) to people. The Holy Cart will be followed by many smaller carts which are pulled by oxen.

The ruins of temples, palaces and ponds are scattered in a vast area of Vedhyari, Buddhanagar VDC. The ruins of the buildings and deep wells are to be found in many areas. Since the last three to four centuries the encroachment by the newcomers has been a major problem to the old heritage. The typical people used to live in this ancient city and its nearby area since unknown past. They called themselves as \"BIRAT RAJBANSHI\" not to be confused with Bengali(Koch) Rajbanshi. In 1914 AD, Colonel Jit Bahadur Khatri, the district governor, laid the foundations of modern Biratnagar by moving the hospital, post office, jail and the customs, land registry, forestry and auditor offices to Gograha Bazaar from [[Rangeli]], the district capital of Morang at the time.<ref name=\"Dambar Krishna Shrestha & Kamal Rimal\">{{cite web|last=Dambar Krishna Shrestha & Kamal Rimal|title=\u0967\u0966\u0966 \u0935\u0930\u094d\u0937\u0915\u094b \u0935\u093f\u0930\u093e\u091f\u0928\u0917\u0930, \u092e\u0923\u093f \u0916\u094b\u091c\u094d\u0926\u0948 (Biratnagar Turns 100, Seeking Glory)|url=http://www.himalkhabar.com/?p=40621|work=Himal Khabar|publisher=Himal Media|accessdate=26 December 2013}}</ref> Biratnagar got its present name in 1919 AD (around 1976 BS) from [[Kaiser Shamsher Jang Bahadur Rana|Keshar Shamsher Rana]] after objects of historical importance were found in the place.<ref name=\"Dambar Krishna Shrestha & Kamal Rimal\"/> The ruins of the palace along with stone carved tools, idols, and household objects can be seen protected in the southern part of Biratnagar, close to the border.

This sparked a countrywide anti-Rana demonstration that eventually led to the abolishment of Rana rule in Nepal.\n\n==Demography==\n===Population and ethnicity===\nAccording to 2011 CBS census data, Biratnagar's population was 214,663.<ref>\"National Population Census 2011\"</ref>  Majority of people are from [[Brahmins|Brahmin]]  & [[Kshatriya]] community.

The [[Tihar (festival)|Tihar]] festival, or festival of lights, occurs when residents line their homes with Diyo (earthen oil lamps), candles and decorative electrical lamps during two days of celebration. Decorations on the main road include the use of banana trees and bamboo in all shops. Firecrackers are banned in Nepal and are strictly prohibited during Tihar,<ref>https://www.rediff.com/news/2006/oct/13nepal.htm</ref> but smuggling them in during Tihar still occurs.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}}\n\n[[Krishna Janmashtami]] (Krishna's birthday) is a festival that is heavily celebrated in Biratnagar. Thousands of people gather on the second day of Krishna Ashtami to pull the Holy Cart (Rath) which goes around the city the length of which is approximately 8&nbsp;km. This event is termed the Rath Yatra (the Cart Journey). It is the largest rath yatra in Nepal and the second largest in Asia.<ref>https://2018.biratnagar.wordcamp.org/12-facts-about-biratnagar/</ref> Traffic will be halted for five to six hours on that day. It is believed that the Holy Cart (Rath) was driven by [[Lord Krishna]]. So, people keep a young child in the Holy Cart as a symbol of Krishna and pull the cart with joy to celebrate the Lord Krishna's birthday. The ''Rath'' is very big and heavy and needs hundreds of men and women to move it. Mostly the recruits of the Nepalese Army are recruited to pull the heavy cart. It has an engine to run if required to move fast, and it has brakes to stop, as it has to stop at many places to allow people to worship the Lord. Some people stay on top of the ''Rath'' to distribute prasad (holy fruits) to people. The Holy Cart will be followed by many smaller carts which are pulled by oxen. People in the smaller carts play music and sing hymns of joy and happiness. It is the most important festival for the people of Biratnagar. So, almost all the schools and offices close after 1 p.m. to let the believers and spectators attend the Rath Yatra (Cart Journey).\n\n[[Chhath]] (Devanagari: \u091b\u0920, \u091b\u0920\u0940, \u091b\u0920 \u092a\u0930\u094d\u0935, \u091b\u0920 \u092a\u0941\u091c\u093e, \u0921\u093e\u0932\u093e \u091b\u0920, \u0921\u093e\u0932\u093e \u092a\u0941\u091c\u093e, \u0938\u0941\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0937\u0937\u094d\u0920\u0940) is an important festival for Madheshi and Bihari Hindus, nowadays observed by all the Hindu communities.

The [[Spring and Autumn Annals|Confucian chronicle]] of the early years of this process led to its title of the \"[[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]]\" period. The [[partition of Jin]] in the mid-5th century BC initiated a second phase, the [[Warring States Period|\"Warring States\"]].{{sfnp|Hucker|1978|p=37}} In 403 BC, the Zhou court recognized [[state of Han|Han]], [[state of Zhao|Zhao]], and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] as fully independent states. [[King Hui of Wei|Duke Hui]] of [[Wei (state)|Wei]], in 344 BC,  was the first to claim the royal title of [[wang (title)|king]] (Chinese: \u738b) for himself. Others followed, marking a turning point, as rulers did not even entertain the pretence of being vassals of the Zhou court, instead proclaiming themselves fully independent kingdoms. A series of states rose to prominence before each falling in turn, and Zhou was a minor player in most of these conflicts.\n\nThe last Zhou king is traditionally taken to be [[King Nan of Zhou|Nan]], who was killed when [[Qin state|Qin]] captured the capital [[Wangcheng (Zhou dynasty)|Wangcheng]]<ref name=\"Chengzhou\"/> in 256 BC. A \"[[Duke Wen of Eastern Zhou|King Hui]]\" was declared, but his splinter state was fully removed by 249 BC. Qin's [[Qin's wars of unification|unification of China]] concluded in 221 BC with [[Qin Shihuang]]'s annexation of [[Qi (state)|Qi]].\n\nThe Eastern Zhou, however, is also remembered as the golden age of Chinese philosophy: the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] which flourished as rival lords patronized itinerant ''[[Four occupations#The shi .28.E5.A3.AB.29|shi]]'' scholars is led by the example of [[Qi (state)|Qi]]'s [[Jixia Academy]]. The [[Nine Schools of Thought]] which came to dominate the others were [[Confucianism]] (as interpreted by [[Mencius]] and others), [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], [[Taoism]], [[Mohism]], the utopian communalist [[Agriculturalism]], two strains of [[school of Diplomacy|Diplomatists]], the sophistic [[School of Names|Logicians]], [[Sun-tzu]]'s [[School of the Military|Militarists]], and the [[School of Naturalists|Naturalists]].<ref name=\"chiphi\">.Carr, Brian & al.

The [[Mohism|Mohists]], for instance, found little interest in their praise of meritocracy but much acceptance for their mastery of defensive siege warfare; much later, however, their arguments against nepotism were used in favor of establishing the [[imperial exam]]ination system.\n\n==Culture and society==\n[[File:Changshadragon.jpg|thumb|upright|right|''[[Silk painting depicting a man riding a dragon]]'', painting on [[silk]], dated to 5th-3rd century BC, from Zidanku Tomb no. 1 in [[Changsha]], [[Hunan]] Province]]\n[[File:Lacquer painting from Ch'u State.jpg|thumb|A [[lacquerware]] painting from the Jingmen Tomb (Chinese: \u834a\u9580\u695a\u5893; Pinyin: J\u012bngm\u00e9n ch\u01d4 m\u00f9) of the [[State of Chu]] (704\u2013223 BC), depicting men wearing precursors to ''[[Hanfu]]'' (i.e. traditional [[silk]] dress) and riding in a two-horsed [[chariot]]]]\n\n===Mandate of Heaven and the justification of power===\n[[Image:Western Zhou Gui Vessel.jpg|thumb|A Western Zhou bronze gui vessel, {{circa|lk=no|1000}} BC]]\n\nZhou rulers introduced what was to prove one of East Asia's most enduring political doctrines: the concept of the \"[[Mandate of Heaven]]\". They did this by asserting that their moral superiority justified taking over Shang wealth and territories, and that heaven had imposed a moral mandate on them to replace the Shang and return good governance to the people.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\">{{Cite book|title=Worlds together, worlds apart|last=Tignor|first=Robert L.|others=Adelman, Jeremy; Aron, Stephen; Brown, Peter; Elman, Benjamin A.; Liu, Xinru; Pittman, Holly|isbn=9780393922080|edition=fourth (two volume)|location=New York|oclc=870312289}}</ref>\n\nThe Mandate of Heaven was presented as a religious compact between the Zhou people and their supreme god in heaven (literally the 'sky god'). The Zhou agreed that since worldly affairs were supposed to align with those of the heavens, the heavens conferred [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] power on only one person, the Zhou ruler. In return, the ruler was duty-bound to uphold heaven's principles of [[harmony]] and [[honor]]. Any ruler who failed in this duty, who let [[instability]] creep into earthly affairs, or who let his people suffer, would lose the mandate. Under this system, it was the [[prerogative]] of spiritual authority to withdraw support from any wayward ruler and to find another, more worthy one.<ref name=\"Worlds together, worlds apart\">{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Robert Tignor, Jeremy Adelman, Peter Brown, Benjamin Elman, Xinru Liu, Holly Pittman, Brent|title=Worlds together, worlds apart|date=2014|isbn=978-0-393-92208-0|page=153|edition=Fourth}}</ref> In this way, the Zhou sky god legitimated regime change.\n\nIn using this creed, the Zhou rulers had to acknowledge that any group of rulers, even they themselves, could be ousted if they lost the mandate of heaven because of improper practices. The book of odes written during the Zhou period clearly intoned this caution.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\"/>\n\nThe early Zhou kings contended that heaven favored their triumph because the last [[Shang]] kings had been evil men whose policies brought pain to the people through waste and corruption. After the Zhou came to power, the mandate became a political tool.\n\nOne of the duties and privileges of the king was to create a royal [[calendar]]. This official document defined times for undertaking agricultural activities and celebrating rituals. But unexpected events such as [[solar eclipses]] or natural [[Disaster|calamities]] threw the ruling house's mandate into question. Since rulers claimed that their authority came from heaven, the Zhou made great efforts to gain accurate knowledge of the stars and to perfect the [[astronomical]] system on which they based their calendar.<ref name=\"Worlds together, worlds apart\"/>\n\nZhou [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] also arose indirectly from [[Shang]] material culture through the use of bronze ritual vessels, [[statues]], ornaments, and [[weapons]].<ref name=\"Worlds together, worlds apart\"/> As the Zhou emulated the Shang's large scale production of ceremonial bronzes, they developed an extensive system of bronze metal working that required a large force of tribute labor. Many of its members were Shang, who were sometimes forcibly transported to new Zhou to produce the bronze ritual objects which were then sold and distributed across the lands, symbolizing Zhou legitimacy.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\"/>\n\n===Feudalism===\n[[Image:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze gui.jpg|thumb|right|A Western Zhou ceremonial bronze of cooking-vessel form inscribed to record that the King of Zhou gave a fiefdom to Shi You, ordering that he inherit the title as well as the land and people living there]]\nWestern writers often describe the Zhou period as \"[[Feudalism|feudal]]\" because the Zhou's ''[[f\u0113ngji\u00e0n]]'' (\u5c01\u5efa) system invites comparison with [[Middle Ages|medieval rule in Europe]].\n\nThere were many similarities between the decentralized systems. When the dynasty was established, the conquered land was divided into hereditary fiefs ({{lang|zh|\u8af8\u4faf}}, ''zh\u016bh\u00f3u'') that eventually became powerful in their own right. In matters of inheritance, the Zhou dynasty recognized only patrilineal [[primogeniture]] as legal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancestral Memory in Early China|first=K.

Marriage and Family, Shanghai. 1934</ref>\n\nThe system, also called \"extensive stratified patrilineage\", was defined by the anthropologist [[Kwang-chih Chang]] as \"characterized by the fact that the eldest son of each generation formed the main of line descent and political authority, whereas the younger brothers were moved out to establish new lineages of lesser authority. The farther removed, the lesser the political authority\". Ebrey defines the descent-line system as follows: \"A great line (ta-tsung) is the line of eldest sons continuing indefinitely from a founding ancestor. A lesser line is the line of younger sons going back no more than five generations. Great lines and lesser lines continually spin off new lesser lines, founded by younger sons\".\n\nK.E. Brashier writes in his book \"Ancestral Memory in Early China\" about the tsung-fa system of patrilineal primogeniture: \"The greater lineage, if it has survived, is the direct succession from father to eldest son and is not defined via the collateral shifts of the lesser lineages. In discussions that demarcate between trunk and collateral lines, the former is called a zong and the latter a zu, whereas the whole lineage is dubbed the shi. [...] On one hand every son who is not the eldest and hence not heir to the lineage territory has the potential of becoming a progenitor and fostering a new trunk lineage (Ideally he would strike out to cultivate new lineage territory). [...] According to the Zou commentary, the [[son of heaven]] divided land among his feudal lords, his feudal lords divided land among their dependent families and so forth down the pecking order to the officers who had their dependent kin and the commoners who \"each had his apportioned relations and all had their graded precedence\"\"<ref>Ancestral Memory in Early China Written By K.

Centralization became more necessary as the states began to war among themselves and decentralization encouraged more war. If a duke took power from his nobles, the state would have to be administered bureaucratically by appointed officials.\n\nDespite these similarities, there are a number of important differences from medieval Europe. One obvious difference is that the Zhou ruled from walled cities rather than castles. Another was China's distinct class system, which lacked an organized clergy but saw the Shang [[Zi (surname)|Zi]]-clan yeomen become masters of ritual and ceremony known as ''Shi'' (\u58eb). When a dukedom was centralized, these people would find employment as government officials or officers. These hereditary classes were similar to Western knights in status and breeding, but like Western clergy were expected to be something of a scholar instead of a warrior. Being appointed, they could move from one state to another. Some would travel from state to state peddling schemes of administrative or military reform. Those who could not find employment would often end up teaching young men who aspired to official status. The most famous of these was [[Confucius]], who taught a system of mutual duty between superiors and inferiors. In contrast, the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]] had no time for Confucian virtue and advocated a system of strict laws and harsh punishments. The wars of the Warring States were finally ended by the most legalist state of all, Qin. When the [[Qin dynasty]] fell and was replaced by the [[Han dynasty]], many Chinese were relieved to return to the more humane virtues of Confucius.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[Image:Shi Qiang pan.jpg|thumb|The [[Shi Qiang pan]], inscribed with the accomplishments of the earliest Zhou kings, circa 10th century BC]]\nAgriculture in the Zhou dynasty was very intensive and, in many cases, directed by the government. All farming lands were owned by nobles, who then gave their land to their [[Serfdom|serfs]], a situation similar to European [[feudalism]]. For example, a piece of land was divided into nine squares in the [[well-field system]], with the grain from the middle square taken by the government and that of surrounding squares kept by individual farmers. This way, the government was able to store surplus food and distribute it in times of famine or bad harvest. Some important manufacturing sectors during this period included bronze smelting, which was integral to making weapons and farming tools. Again, these industries were dominated by the nobility who directed the production of such materials.\n\nChina's first projects of [[hydraulic engineering]] were initiated during the Zhou dynasty, ultimately as a means to aid agricultural [[irrigation]]. The [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] of [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Sunshu Ao]], who served [[King Zhuang of Chu]], dammed a river to create an enormous irrigation [[reservoir]] in modern-day northern [[Anhui]] province. For this, Sunshu is credited as China's first hydraulic engineer. The later Wei statesman [[Ximen Bao]], who served [[Marquis Wen of Wei]] (445-396 BC), was the first hydraulic engineer of China to have created a large irrigation canal system. As the main focus of his grandiose project, his canal work eventually diverted the waters of the entire [[Zhang River]] to a spot further up the [[Yellow River]].\n\n===Military===\nThe early Western Zhou supported a strong army, split into two major units: \"the Six Armies of the west\" and \"the Eight Armies of Chengzhou\". The armies campaigned in the northern [[Loess Plateau]], modern [[Ningxia]] and the [[Yellow River]] floodplain. The military prowess of Zhou peaked during the 19th year of [[King Zhao of Zhou|King Zhao]]'s reign, when the six armies were wiped out along with King Zhao on a campaign around the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]].  Early Zhou kings were true commanders-in-chief. They were in constant wars with barbarians on behalf of the fiefs called ''guo'', which at that time meant \"statelet\" or \"principality\".\n\n[[File:Charioteer figure, bronze, Eastern Zhou Dynasty.JPG|thumb|A bronze figure of a [[Chariot (China)|charioteer]] from the Warring States era of the Zhou Dynasty, dated 4th to 3rd century BC]]\n[[File:Chinese silk, 4th Century BC.JPG|thumb|An embroidered silk gauze ritual garment from an Eastern-Zhou-era tomb at Mashan, Hubei province, China, 4th century BC]]\n[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze sword.jpg|thumb|An Eastern-Zhou bronze sword excavated from Changsa, Hunan Province]]\n[[File:Crystal Cup(Warring States Period) in Hangzhou Museum.JPG|thumb|A drinking cup carved from [[crystal]], unearthed at Banshan, [[Hangzhou]], [[Warring States]] period, [[Hangzhou Museum]].]]\n[[File:Bianzhong.jpg|thumb|The [[Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng]], a set of bronze ''[[bianzhong]]'' percussion instruments from the [[Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng|tomb of the aforesaid marquis]] in [[Hubei]] province, China, dated 433 BC, [[Warring States]] period]]\nKing Zhao was famous for repeated campaigns in the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] areas and died in his last action. Later kings' campaigns were less effective. [[King Li of Zhou|King Li]] led 14 armies against [[barbarians]] in the south, but failed to achieve any victory. [[King Xuan of Zhou|King Xuan]] fought the [[Quanrong]] nomads in vain. [[King You of Zhou|King You]] was killed by the Quanrong when Haojing was sacked. Although [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariots]] had been introduced to China during the Shang dynasty from Central Asia, the Zhou period saw the first major use of chariots in battle.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1988}} Recent archaeological finds demonstrate similarities between [[horse burial]]s of the Shang and Zhou dynasties and Indo-European peoples in the west.<ref name=\"KrechSteinicke\">{{harvnb|Krech|Steinicke|2011|p=100}}</ref> Other possible cultural influences resulting from Indo-European contact in this period may include fighting styles, head-and-hooves burials, art motifs and myths.<ref name=\"KrechSteinicke\"/>\n\n===Philosophy===\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, the origins of native [[Chinese philosophy]] developed, its initial stages of development beginning in the 6th century BC. The greatest Chinese philosophers, those who made the greatest impact on later generations of Chinese, were [[Confucius]], founder of [[Confucianism]], and [[Laozi]], founder of [[Taoism]]. Other philosophers, theorists, and schools of thought in this era were [[Mozi]], founder of [[Mohism]]; [[Mencius]], a famous Confucian who expanded upon Confucius' legacy; [[Shang Yang]] and [[Han Fei]], responsible for the development of ancient Chinese [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] (the core philosophy of the [[Qin dynasty]]); and [[Xun Zi]], who was arguably the center of ancient Chinese intellectual life during his time, even more so than iconic intellectual figures such as Mencius.{{sfnp|Schirokauer|Brown|2006|pp=25\u201347}}\n\n====Li====\n{{Main|Li (Confucian)}}\nEstablished during the Western period, the ''Li'' ({{CJKV|t=\u79ae|s=\u793c|p=l\u01d0}}) ritual system encoded an understanding of manners as an expression of the social hierarchy, ethics, and regulation concerning material life; the corresponding social practices became idealized within Confucian ideology.\n\nThe system was canonized in the ''[[Book of Rites]]'', ''[[Zhou li|Zhouli]]'', and ''[[Yili (text)|Yili]]'' compendiums of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC&ndash;220 AD), thus becoming the heart of the Chinese imperial ideology. While the system was initially a respected body of concrete regulations, the fragmentation of the Western Zhou period led the ritual to drift towards moralization and formalization in regard to:\n\n* The five orders of [[Chinese nobility]].\n* Ancestral temples (size, legitimate number of pavilions)\n* Ceremonial regulations (number of [[Ding (vessel)|ritual vessels]], musical instruments, people in the dancing troupe)\n\n==Kings==\n{{see also|Family tree of ancient Chinese emperors#Zhou dynasty|label 1=The family tree of the Zhou kings}}\n{{anchor|kings|list of kings|list of rulers}}\nThe rulers of the Zhou dynasty were titled ''W\u00e1ng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u738b}}}}), which is normally translated into English as \"king\" and was also the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] term for their rulers.<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = China in the Early Bronze Age\n  | first = Robert L. | last = Thorp\n  | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8122-3910-2\n  | page = 176\n}}</ref>\nIn addition to these rulers, King Wu's immediate ancestors {{ndash}} [[Gugong Danfu|Danfu]], [[King Ji of Zhou|Jili]], and [[King Wen of Zhou|Wen]] {{ndash}} are also referred to as \"Kings of Zhou\", despite having been nominal vassals of the Shang kings.\n\nNB: Dates in Chinese history before the first year of the [[Gonghe Regency]] in 841 BC are contentious and vary by source.

The [[Spring and Autumn Annals|Confucian chronicle]] of the early years of this process led to its title of the \"[[Spring and Autumn period|Spring and Autumn]]\" period. The [[partition of Jin]] in the mid-5th century BC initiated a second phase, the [[Warring States Period|\"Warring States\"]].{{sfnp|Hucker|1978|p=37}} In 403 BC, the Zhou court recognized [[state of Han|Han]], [[state of Zhao|Zhao]], and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] as fully independent states. [[King Hui of Wei|Duke Hui]] of [[Wei (state)|Wei]], in 344 BC,  was the first to claim the royal title of [[wang (title)|king]] (Chinese: \u738b) for himself. Others followed, marking a turning point, as rulers did not even entertain the pretence of being vassals of the Zhou court, instead proclaiming themselves fully independent kingdoms. A series of states rose to prominence before each falling in turn, and Zhou was a minor player in most of these conflicts.\n\nThe last Zhou king is traditionally taken to be [[King Nan of Zhou|Nan]], who was killed when [[Qin state|Qin]] captured the capital [[Wangcheng (Zhou dynasty)|Wangcheng]]<ref name=\"Chengzhou\"/> in 256 BC. A \"[[Duke Wen of Eastern Zhou|King Hui]]\" was declared, but his splinter state was fully removed by 249 BC.

They did this by asserting that their moral superiority justified taking over Shang wealth and territories, and that heaven had imposed a moral mandate on them to replace the Shang and return good governance to the people.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\">{{Cite book|title=Worlds together, worlds apart|last=Tignor|first=Robert L.|others=Adelman, Jeremy; Aron, Stephen; Brown, Peter; Elman, Benjamin A.; Liu, Xinru; Pittman, Holly|isbn=9780393922080|edition=fourth (two volume)|location=New York|oclc=870312289}}</ref>\n\nThe Mandate of Heaven was presented as a religious compact between the Zhou people and their supreme god in heaven (literally the 'sky god'). The Zhou agreed that since worldly affairs were supposed to align with those of the heavens, the heavens conferred [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] power on only one person, the Zhou ruler. In return, the ruler was duty-bound to uphold heaven's principles of [[harmony]] and [[honor]]. Any ruler who failed in this duty, who let [[instability]] creep into earthly affairs, or who let his people suffer, would lose the mandate. Under this system, it was the [[prerogative]] of spiritual authority to withdraw support from any wayward ruler and to find another, more worthy one.<ref name=\"Worlds together, worlds apart\">{{cite book|last1=Shaw|first1=Robert Tignor, Jeremy Adelman, Peter Brown, Benjamin Elman, Xinru Liu, Holly Pittman, Brent|title=Worlds together, worlds apart|date=2014|isbn=978-0-393-92208-0|page=153|edition=Fourth}}</ref> In this way, the Zhou sky god legitimated regime change.\n\nIn using this creed, the Zhou rulers had to acknowledge that any group of rulers, even they themselves, could be ousted if they lost the mandate of heaven because of improper practices. The book of odes written during the Zhou period clearly intoned this caution.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\"/>\n\nThe early Zhou kings contended that heaven favored their triumph because the last [[Shang]] kings had been evil men whose policies brought pain to the people through waste and corruption. After the Zhou came to power, the mandate became a political tool.\n\nOne of the duties and privileges of the king was to create a royal [[calendar]]. This official document defined times for undertaking agricultural activities and celebrating rituals. But unexpected events such as [[solar eclipses]] or natural [[Disaster|calamities]] threw the ruling house's mandate into question. Since rulers claimed that their authority came from heaven, the Zhou made great efforts to gain accurate knowledge of the stars and to perfect the [[astronomical]] system on which they based their calendar.<ref name=\"Worlds together, worlds apart\"/>\n\nZhou [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] also arose indirectly from [[Shang]] material culture through the use of bronze ritual vessels, [[statues]], ornaments, and [[weapons]].<ref name=\"Worlds together, worlds apart\"/> As the Zhou emulated the Shang's large scale production of ceremonial bronzes, they developed an extensive system of bronze metal working that required a large force of tribute labor. Many of its members were Shang, who were sometimes forcibly transported to new Zhou to produce the bronze ritual objects which were then sold and distributed across the lands, symbolizing Zhou legitimacy.<ref name=\"worldcat.org\"/>\n\n===Feudalism===\n[[Image:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze gui.jpg|thumb|right|A Western Zhou ceremonial bronze of cooking-vessel form inscribed to record that the King of Zhou gave a fiefdom to Shi You, ordering that he inherit the title as well as the land and people living there]]\nWestern writers often describe the Zhou period as \"[[Feudalism|feudal]]\" because the Zhou's ''[[f\u0113ngji\u00e0n]]'' (\u5c01\u5efa) system invites comparison with [[Middle Ages|medieval rule in Europe]].\n\nThere were many similarities between the decentralized systems. When the dynasty was established, the conquered land was divided into hereditary fiefs ({{lang|zh|\u8af8\u4faf}}, ''zh\u016bh\u00f3u'') that eventually became powerful in their own right. In matters of inheritance, the Zhou dynasty recognized only patrilineal [[primogeniture]] as legal.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Ancestral Memory in Early China|first=K.

Marriage and Family, Shanghai. 1934</ref>\n\nThe system, also called \"extensive stratified patrilineage\", was defined by the anthropologist [[Kwang-chih Chang]] as \"characterized by the fact that the eldest son of each generation formed the main of line descent and political authority, whereas the younger brothers were moved out to establish new lineages of lesser authority. The farther removed, the lesser the political authority\". Ebrey defines the descent-line system as follows: \"A great line (ta-tsung) is the line of eldest sons continuing indefinitely from a founding ancestor. A lesser line is the line of younger sons going back no more than five generations. Great lines and lesser lines continually spin off new lesser lines, founded by younger sons\".\n\nK.E. Brashier writes in his book \"Ancestral Memory in Early China\" about the tsung-fa system of patrilineal primogeniture: \"The greater lineage, if it has survived, is the direct succession from father to eldest son and is not defined via the collateral shifts of the lesser lineages. In discussions that demarcate between trunk and collateral lines, the former is called a zong and the latter a zu, whereas the whole lineage is dubbed the shi. [...] On one hand every son who is not the eldest and hence not heir to the lineage territory has the potential of becoming a progenitor and fostering a new trunk lineage (Ideally he would strike out to cultivate new lineage territory). [...] According to the Zou commentary, the [[son of heaven]] divided land among his feudal lords, his feudal lords divided land among their dependent families and so forth down the pecking order to the officers who had their dependent kin and the commoners who \"each had his apportioned relations and all had their graded precedence\"\"<ref>Ancestral Memory in Early China Written By K.

Centralization became more necessary as the states began to war among themselves and decentralization encouraged more war. If a duke took power from his nobles, the state would have to be administered bureaucratically by appointed officials.\n\nDespite these similarities, there are a number of important differences from medieval Europe. One obvious difference is that the Zhou ruled from walled cities rather than castles. Another was China's distinct class system, which lacked an organized clergy but saw the Shang [[Zi (surname)|Zi]]-clan yeomen become masters of ritual and ceremony known as ''Shi'' (\u58eb). When a dukedom was centralized, these people would find employment as government officials or officers. These hereditary classes were similar to Western knights in status and breeding, but like Western clergy were expected to be something of a scholar instead of a warrior. Being appointed, they could move from one state to another. Some would travel from state to state peddling schemes of administrative or military reform. Those who could not find employment would often end up teaching young men who aspired to official status. The most famous of these was [[Confucius]], who taught a system of mutual duty between superiors and inferiors. In contrast, the [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalists]] had no time for Confucian virtue and advocated a system of strict laws and harsh punishments. The wars of the Warring States were finally ended by the most legalist state of all, Qin. When the [[Qin dynasty]] fell and was replaced by the [[Han dynasty]], many Chinese were relieved to return to the more humane virtues of Confucius.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}\n\n===Agriculture===\n[[Image:Shi Qiang pan.jpg|thumb|The [[Shi Qiang pan]], inscribed with the accomplishments of the earliest Zhou kings, circa 10th century BC]]\nAgriculture in the Zhou dynasty was very intensive and, in many cases, directed by the government. All farming lands were owned by nobles, who then gave their land to their [[Serfdom|serfs]], a situation similar to European [[feudalism]]. For example, a piece of land was divided into nine squares in the [[well-field system]], with the grain from the middle square taken by the government and that of surrounding squares kept by individual farmers. This way, the government was able to store surplus food and distribute it in times of famine or bad harvest. Some important manufacturing sectors during this period included bronze smelting, which was integral to making weapons and farming tools. Again, these industries were dominated by the nobility who directed the production of such materials.\n\nChina's first projects of [[hydraulic engineering]] were initiated during the Zhou dynasty, ultimately as a means to aid agricultural [[irrigation]]. The [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] of [[Wei (state)|Wei]], [[Sunshu Ao]], who served [[King Zhuang of Chu]], dammed a river to create an enormous irrigation [[reservoir]] in modern-day northern [[Anhui]] province. For this, Sunshu is credited as China's first hydraulic engineer. The later Wei statesman [[Ximen Bao]], who served [[Marquis Wen of Wei]] (445-396 BC), was the first hydraulic engineer of China to have created a large irrigation canal system. As the main focus of his grandiose project, his canal work eventually diverted the waters of the entire [[Zhang River]] to a spot further up the [[Yellow River]].\n\n===Military===\nThe early Western Zhou supported a strong army, split into two major units: \"the Six Armies of the west\" and \"the Eight Armies of Chengzhou\". The armies campaigned in the northern [[Loess Plateau]], modern [[Ningxia]] and the [[Yellow River]] floodplain. The military prowess of Zhou peaked during the 19th year of [[King Zhao of Zhou|King Zhao]]'s reign, when the six armies were wiped out along with King Zhao on a campaign around the [[Han River (Hanshui)|Han River]].  Early Zhou kings were true commanders-in-chief. They were in constant wars with barbarians on behalf of the fiefs called ''guo'', which at that time meant \"statelet\" or \"principality\".\n\n[[File:Charioteer figure, bronze, Eastern Zhou Dynasty.JPG|thumb|A bronze figure of a [[Chariot (China)|charioteer]] from the Warring States era of the Zhou Dynasty, dated 4th to 3rd century BC]]\n[[File:Chinese silk, 4th Century BC.JPG|thumb|An embroidered silk gauze ritual garment from an Eastern-Zhou-era tomb at Mashan, Hubei province, China, 4th century BC]]\n[[File:CMOC Treasures of Ancient China exhibit - bronze sword.jpg|thumb|An Eastern-Zhou bronze sword excavated from Changsa, Hunan Province]]\n[[File:Crystal Cup(Warring States Period) in Hangzhou Museum.JPG|thumb|A drinking cup carved from [[crystal]], unearthed at Banshan, [[Hangzhou]], [[Warring States]] period, [[Hangzhou Museum]].]]\n[[File:Bianzhong.jpg|thumb|The [[Bianzhong of Marquis Yi of Zeng]], a set of bronze ''[[bianzhong]]'' percussion instruments from the [[Tomb of Marquis Yi of Zeng|tomb of the aforesaid marquis]] in [[Hubei]] province, China, dated 433 BC, [[Warring States]] period]]\nKing Zhao was famous for repeated campaigns in the [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] areas and died in his last action. Later kings' campaigns were less effective. [[King Li of Zhou|King Li]] led 14 armies against [[barbarians]] in the south, but failed to achieve any victory. [[King Xuan of Zhou|King Xuan]] fought the [[Quanrong]] nomads in vain. [[King You of Zhou|King You]] was killed by the Quanrong when Haojing was sacked. Although [[Chariot (Ancient China)|chariots]] had been introduced to China during the Shang dynasty from Central Asia, the Zhou period saw the first major use of chariots in battle.{{sfnp|Ebrey|Walthall|Palais|2006|p=14}}{{sfnp|Shaughnessy|1988}} Recent archaeological finds demonstrate similarities between [[horse burial]]s of the Shang and Zhou dynasties and Indo-European peoples in the west.<ref name=\"KrechSteinicke\">{{harvnb|Krech|Steinicke|2011|p=100}}</ref> Other possible cultural influences resulting from Indo-European contact in this period may include fighting styles, head-and-hooves burials, art motifs and myths.<ref name=\"KrechSteinicke\"/>\n\n===Philosophy===\nDuring the Zhou dynasty, the origins of native [[Chinese philosophy]] developed, its initial stages of development beginning in the 6th century BC. The greatest Chinese philosophers, those who made the greatest impact on later generations of Chinese, were [[Confucius]], founder of [[Confucianism]], and [[Laozi]], founder of [[Taoism]]. Other philosophers, theorists, and schools of thought in this era were [[Mozi]], founder of [[Mohism]]; [[Mencius]], a famous Confucian who expanded upon Confucius' legacy; [[Shang Yang]] and [[Han Fei]], responsible for the development of ancient Chinese [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] (the core philosophy of the [[Qin dynasty]]); and [[Xun Zi]], who was arguably the center of ancient Chinese intellectual life during his time, even more so than iconic intellectual figures such as Mencius.{{sfnp|Schirokauer|Brown|2006|pp=25\u201347}}\n\n====Li====\n{{Main|Li (Confucian)}}\nEstablished during the Western period, the ''Li'' ({{CJKV|t=\u79ae|s=\u793c|p=l\u01d0}}) ritual system encoded an understanding of manners as an expression of the social hierarchy, ethics, and regulation concerning material life; the corresponding social practices became idealized within Confucian ideology.\n\nThe system was canonized in the ''[[Book of Rites]]'', ''[[Zhou li|Zhouli]]'', and ''[[Yili (text)|Yili]]'' compendiums of the [[Han dynasty]] (206 BC&ndash;220 AD), thus becoming the heart of the Chinese imperial ideology. While the system was initially a respected body of concrete regulations, the fragmentation of the Western Zhou period led the ritual to drift towards moralization and formalization in regard to:\n\n* The five orders of [[Chinese nobility]].\n* Ancestral temples (size, legitimate number of pavilions)\n* Ceremonial regulations (number of [[Ding (vessel)|ritual vessels]], musical instruments, people in the dancing troupe)\n\n==Kings==\n{{see also|Family tree of ancient Chinese emperors#Zhou dynasty|label 1=The family tree of the Zhou kings}}\n{{anchor|kings|list of kings|list of rulers}}\nThe rulers of the Zhou dynasty were titled ''W\u00e1ng'' ({{lang|zh|{{linktext|\u738b}}}}), which is normally translated into English as \"king\" and was also the [[Shang dynasty|Shang]] term for their rulers.<ref>{{cite book\n  | title = China in the Early Bronze Age\n  | first = Robert L. | last = Thorp\n  | publisher = University of Pennsylvania Press | year = 2005 | isbn = 978-0-8122-3910-2\n  | page = 176\n}}</ref>\nIn addition to these rulers, King Wu's immediate ancestors {{ndash}} [[Gugong Danfu|Danfu]], [[King Ji of Zhou|Jili]], and [[King Wen of Zhou|Wen]] {{ndash}} are also referred to as \"Kings of Zhou\", despite having been nominal vassals of the Shang kings.\n\nNB: Dates in Chinese history before the first year of the [[Gonghe Regency]] in 841 BC are contentious and vary by source.

The shark convulses and in a few moments is transformed by the probe into a red-lined robotic [[simulacrum]] of the ocean predator. An American [[nuclear submarine]] in the area detects the robotic shark's movements and, considering it an unknown hostile entity, the captain decides to destroy it. Instead, the submarine's hull is breached by the shark's newly enhanced teeth and all hands are lost.\n\nIn [[Seattle]], a [[viral video]] of uncertain authenticity begins to circulate of a [[seaplane]] being attacked in the harbour. Local reporter Trish Larson is tired of her role as \"the wacky weather girl\" and complains about [[fake news]]. She defies station orders and takes her cameraman Louie to cover area military activity in the [[Discovery Park (Seattle)|Discovery Park]] area, and they witness the so-called Roboshark as it invades a coffee shop and devours a customer who unwittingly [[livestream]]s his own demise. Trish's story is hijacked by her colleague Veronica. Trish's husband Rick, a supervisor at the Seattle [[public works]] department, is tracking the alien's progress through the sewers and informs her of its movements even as Roboshark begins trending in earnest. The [[U.S. Navy|Navy]] commandeers his office, determined to destroy Roboshark by any means necessary, even at the cost of bystanders' lives.\n[[File:Seattle - Pacific Place interior pano 01.jpg|thumb|[[Pacific Place (Seattle)|Pacific Place]] (interior)]]\n[[Navy SEALs]] track and engage Roboshark in the [[Pacific Place (Seattle)|Pacific Place]] mall.

Veronica gets too close to the action in her zeal to win a [[Peabody Award]] and is likewise killed. A final confrontation ensues at the [[Space Needle]], which Roboshark intends to use as a means to \"phone home\". The battle leads to the Needle collapsing, Admiral Black along with it, and the disappearance of the alien. Rick is reunited with Trish and Melody.\n\nSome time later, a woman walks in the park amid the Space Needle debris with a small dog whose eyes begin to glow red.\n\n==Cast==\n;Main\n{{Castlist|\n*[[Alexis Peterman]] as Trish\n*[[Matt Rippy]] as Rick\n*Nigel Barber as Admiral Black\n*Vanessa Grasse as Melody\n*Isaac Haig as Louie\n*Laura Dale as Veronica\n*Steve Sires as Bill Glates\n}}\n;Supporting\n{{Castlist|\n*Vladimir Mihaylov as Erik\n*Derek Morse as Chief Xavier\n*Raymond Steers as Commander Summer\n*Lorenzo Estebanez as Rodriguez\n*Kitodar Todorov as Malone\n*Hristo Balabanov as Max\n*Anton Poriazov as Bike Rider Go Pro Guy\n*Atanas Srebrev as Fire Chief Wilson\n*Anton Trendafilov as Phil\n*Daniel Ganev as Barista\n}}\n\n==Genre and themes==\nRichard Scheib remarks that the \"gonzo shark film\" has become its own \"mini-genre\" in the 2010s: \"the shark film began a move towards the increasingly tongue-in-cheek, something that reached its zenith with the deliberate absurdity of the instant bad movie hit ''Sharknado'' (2013).\"<ref name=\"Scheib\" /> Scheib lists some twenty titles of shark films in a similar vein, and explains its attractiveness to a filmmaker: \"no matter how cheesy and ridiculous the film is, it actually adds to the appeal.\"<blockquote>Indeed, filmmakers seem to be in a competition with each other as to how absurdly over-the-top they are capable of making each film and/or the mash-up the title brings together. From the outset, ''Roboshark'' looks set to try and top the cheesiness value. The film is made with the cut-price locations and effects common to BUFO's other disaster and monster movies...  In particular, the CGI animation of the Roboshark is painfully obvious and cheap.<ref name=\"Scheib\" /></blockquote>\n[[File:Dr. Strangelove - Riding the Bomb.png|thumb|[[Slim Pickens]] riding the Bomb in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'', a possible reference in ''Roboshark''.]]\nA recurring theme and object of \"sly\" [[satire]] running through ''Roboshark'' is the world of [[social media]] and online reactions to current events, something which \"sets it apart from its many, many brethren.\"<ref name=\"Craggus\">{{cite web |title=Roboshark (2015) #SharkWeak Review |url=https://thecraggus.com/2017/08/01/roboshark-2015-sharkweak-review/ |website=What the Craggus Saw |accessdate=1 September 2019}}</ref> Scheib speculates that this may have been an attempt to capitalize on the fact that \"the ''Sharknado'' phenomenon was spawned by ''Twitter''.\"<ref name=\"Scheib\" /> In the same vein, ''Roboshark'' also takes \"pot shots\" at [[Microsoft]] and [[Starbucks]], closely associated with Seattle.<ref name=\"Craggus\" />\n\nFinally, there are also many [[inside jokes]]<ref name=\"Bowman\" /> and references to [[science fiction films]], ''[[Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]'' and ''[[THX 1138]]'' to name two.<ref name=\"Craggus\" /> Lisa Bowman suggests that the film's penultimate scene of the Admiral's [[kamikaze]]-style use of the Space Needle references [[Slim Pickens]] riding the [[nuclear bomb]] in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]''.<ref name=\"Bowman\" />\n\n==Production==\n===Background===\nThe Bulgarian Unified Film Organization (UFO International Productions LLC during production),<ref name=\"UFO\" /> is [[Phillip J.

''SciFi & Scary'' gave the film 5/5: \"Overall, ''Roboshark'' was a delight to watch and to interact with, because, yes, folks, Roboshark will follow you on Twitter.\"<ref name=\"SFS\" /> Lisa Bowman calls it \"the type of film that must be watched with a large group of people looking to have a good (and silly) time. It's the type of film that literally begged to be live tweeted and, needless to say, that's exactly what a lot of us did.\" <ref name=\"Bowman\" /> Richard Scheib assigned the film 3 stars: \"The film keeps serving up a range of entertainingly preposterous scenes...  By far the most entertaining parts of the film are where the Roboshark goes on the internet... By the end, the film even gets itself together and delivers some reasonably accomplished effects as the military decide to crash the Space Needle down to kill Roboshark.\"<ref name=\"Scheib\" />\n\nSteve Hutchison agrees the film is entertaining, providing a \"chuckle every two minutes\"; an \"extremely stupid story, but without ever testing our attention span.\" The film is \"a guilty pleasure\" but: \"Sadly, this picture runs out of things to say after the first half.

From the outset, ''Roboshark'' looks set to try and top the cheesiness value. The film is made with the cut-price locations and effects common to BUFO's other disaster and monster movies...

''SciFi & Scary'' gave the film 5/5: \"Overall, ''Roboshark'' was a delight to watch and to interact with, because, yes, folks, Roboshark will follow you on Twitter.\"<ref name=\"SFS\" /> Lisa Bowman calls it \"the type of film that must be watched with a large group of people looking to have a good (and silly) time. It's the type of film that literally begged to be live tweeted and, needless to say, that's exactly what a lot of us did.\" <ref name=\"Bowman\" /> Richard Scheib assigned the film 3 stars: \"The film keeps serving up a range of entertainingly preposterous scenes...

By the end, the film even gets itself together and delivers some reasonably accomplished effects as the military decide to crash the Space Needle down to kill Roboshark.\"<ref name=\"Scheib\" />\n\nSteve Hutchison agrees the film is entertaining, providing a \"chuckle every two minutes\"; an \"extremely stupid story, but without ever testing our attention span.\" The film is \"a guilty pleasure\" but: \"Sadly, this picture runs out of things to say after the first half.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur. On 7 August Charles was persuaded by communications with the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], that the city would be surrendered quickly and without bloodshed if the King made a show of force. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined castle by the river and a stretch of wall that linked South, East and original North Gates, the last known as Inner North Gate and now well within the city, still survived. From South to East Gates the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Herbert's army in February, and then the fall of Bristol, prompted the hurried reinforcement of the exsting defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from South Gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to Outer North Gate. From there it followed the River Twyver, which formed a moat, north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This third, easternmost channel of the River Severn was filled in in the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west, and was extended the other side to the east channel of the River Severn just above West Gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at Inner North Gate and along the walls of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The Outer North Gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline, while what the Town Regiment lacked in experience it made up for with a motivation rooted in ties to the city it was defending. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member common council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nOn 10 August, the Royalist army arrived at Gloucester and promptly demanded that Colonel [[Edward Massey]] surrender. Massey refused and Royalist forces began digging in and setting up artillery batteries around the south and east gates of the city and severed or diverted water pipes. The defenders burned houses and other obstacles outside the city walls. The bombardment of the city began.\n\nHowever, over the next days, the defenders made several sallies from the gates, attacking and disabling Royalist artillery, taking prisoners and tools. Breaches in the wall were filled with cannon baskets and wool sacks. The Royalists made attempts to drain the city moat and fill it in at places.\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur. On 7 August Charles was persuaded by communications with the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], that the city would be surrendered quickly and without bloodshed if the King made a show of force. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined castle by the river and a stretch of wall that linked South, East and original North Gates, the last known as Inner North Gate and now well within the city, still survived. From South to East Gates the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe arrival of Herbert's army in February, and then the fall of Bristol, prompted the hurried reinforcement of the exsting defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from South Gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to Outer North Gate. From there it followed the River Twyver, which formed a moat, north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This third, easternmost channel of the River Severn was filled in in the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west, and was extended the other side to the east channel of the River Severn just above West Gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at Inner North Gate and along the walls of [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The Outer North Gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline, while what the Town Regiment lacked in experience it made up for with a motivation rooted in ties to the city it was defending. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member common council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen aldermen, including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nOn 10 August, the Royalist army arrived at Gloucester and promptly demanded that Colonel [[Edward Massey]] surrender. Massey refused and Royalist forces began digging in and setting up artillery batteries around the south and east gates of the city and severed or diverted water pipes. The defenders burned houses and other obstacles outside the city walls. The bombardment of the city began.\n\nHowever, over the next days, the defenders made several sallies from the gates, attacking and disabling Royalist artillery, taking prisoners and tools. Breaches in the wall were filled with cannon baskets and wool sacks. The Royalists made attempts to drain the city moat and fill it in at places.\n\nAs the siege was prolonged, the King requested his favourite, Prince Rupert, who was currently holding the newly captured port of Bristol, to acquire a newly built cannon from his friends and associates in the Low Countries. This was done post-haste and this huge cannon was shipped over to Bristol and escorted up the Severn Channel to Gloucester, to be positioned just outside the city walls (actually on the high wall of Llanthony Secunda priory in Hempsted), aimed at the cathedral itself.\n\nUnfortunately for the King, his gunners had no experience of firing the brand new gun, especially one larger than they had ever used before, and, on its initial firing, the cannon exploded. With this failure and the excessive time spent trying to take Gloucester, the King had given Parliament enough time to gather huge London forces to march to its relief.\n\nOn 26 August the Earl of Essex left London with an army of 15,000 men to relieve the City. Meanwhile, the Royalist army began tunnelling to place a mine under the East Gate, but a sudden spell of bad weather flooded the tunnel, leaving enough time for the Earl of Essex to arrive and reinforce the city. \n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

Papyrus 75 (= Papyrus Bodmer XIV-XV) is another very early manuscript (late 2nd - early 3rd century), and it includes an attribution of the gospel to Luke. The oldest complete texts are the 4th century [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]], both from the Alexandrian family; [[Codex Bezae]], a 5th- or 6th-century [[Western text-type]] manuscript that contains Luke in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] versions on facing pages, appears to have descended from an offshoot of the main manuscript tradition, departing from more familiar readings at many points. [[Codex Bezae]] shows comprehensively the differences between the versions which show no core theological significance. {{sfn|Ellis|2003|p=19}}{{NoteTag|Verses {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:19\u201320|31}} are omitted in Codex Bezae and a handful of [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] manuscripts.

Verse 22:20, which is very similar to {{bibleverse|1|Cor|11:25}}, and provides gospel support for the doctrine of the [[New Covenant]], along with {{bibleverse|Matthew|26:28}} and {{bibleverse|Mark|14:24}} (both, in the [[Textus Receptus]] Greek manuscript). Verses {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:43\u201344|31}} are found in Western text-type, are omitted by a diverse number of ancient witnesses, and are generally marked as such in modern translations.

Matthew and Luke share a large amount of additional material that is not found in Mark, and each also has a proportion of unique material.]]\n\nLuke\u2013Acts is a religio-political history of the Founder of the church and his successors, in both deeds and words. The author describes his book as a \"narrative\" (''diegesis''), rather than as a gospel, and implicitly criticises his predecessors for not giving their readers the speeches of Jesus and the Apostles, as such speeches were the mark of a \"full\" report, the vehicle through which ancient historians conveyed the meaning of their narratives. He seems to have taken as his model the works of two respected Classical authors, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], who wrote a history of Rome, and the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], author of a [[Antiquities of the Jews|history of the Jews]]. All three authors anchor the histories of their respective peoples  by dating the births of the founders (Romulus, Moses, and Jesus) and narrate the stories of the founders' births from God, so that they are sons of God. Each founder taught authoritatively, appeared to witnesses after death, and ascended to heaven. Crucial aspects of the teaching of all three concerned the relationship between rich and poor and the question of whether \"foreigners\" were to be received into the people.{{sfn|Balch|2003|p=1104}}\n\nThe author of Luke used the [[Gospel of Mark]] as a source for the narrative of Christ's earthly life, and likely used a hypothetical sayings collection called the [[Q source]] for Jesus' teachings, although the existence of Q has been questioned by some scholars.{{sfn|Adamczewski|2010|p=30ff}}{{sfn|Goodacre|2002}}{{sfn|Farrer|1955}} Mark, written around 70 AD, provided the narrative outline, but Mark contains comparatively little of Jesus' teachings.{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|p=284}} For these Luke likely turned to Q, which would have consisted mostly, although not exclusively, of \"sayings\".{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=82}} Mark and Q account for about 64% of Luke. The remaining material, known as the [[L source]], is of unknown origin and date.{{sfn|Powell|1998|pp=39\u201340}} Most Q and L-source material is grouped in two clusters, Luke 6:17\u20138:3 and 9:51\u201318:14, and L-source material forms the first two sections of the gospel (the preface and infancy and childhood narratives).{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=204}}\n\n===Audience and authorial intent===\nLuke was written to be read aloud to a group of Jesus-followers gathered in a house to share the Lord's supper.{{sfn|Balch|2003|p=1104}} The author assumes an educated Greek-speaking audience, but directs his attention to specifically Christian concerns rather than to the Greco-Roman world at large.{{sfn|Green|1995|pp=16\u201317}} He begins his gospel with a preface addressed to \"Theophilus\" ([[Luke 1:3]]; ''cf.'' [[Acts 1:1]]): the name means \"Lover of God,\" and could mean any Christian though most interpreters consider it a reference to a Christian convert and Luke's literary patron.{{sfn|Meier|2013|p=417}} Here he informs Theophilus of his intention, which is to lead his reader to certainty through an orderly account \"of the events that have been fulfilled among us.\"{{sfn|Green|1997|p=35}} He did not, however, intend to provide Theophilus with a historical justification of the Christian faith \u2013 \"did it happen?\" \u2013 but to encourage faith \u2013 \"what happened, and what does it all mean?\"{{sfn|Green|1997|p=36}}\n\n==Structure and content==\n{{Content of Luke}}\n\n===Structure of Luke's Gospel===\nFollowing the author's preface addressed to his patron and the two birth narratives (John the Baptist and Jesus), the gospel opens in Galilee and moves gradually to its climax in Jerusalem:{{sfn|Carroll|2012|pp=15\u201316}}\n# A brief preface addressed to Theophilus stating the author's aims;\n# Birth and infancy narratives for both Jesus and John the Baptist, interpreted as the dawn of the promised era of Israel's salvation;\n# Preparation for Jesus' messianic mission: John's prophetic mission, his baptism of Jesus, and the testing of Jesus' vocation;\n# The beginning of Jesus' mission in Galilee, and the hostile reception there;\n# The central section: the journey to Jerusalem, where Jesus knows he must meet his destiny as God's prophet and messiah;\n# His mission in Jerusalem, culminating in confrontation with the leaders of the Jewish Temple;\n# His last supper with his most intimate followers, followed by his arrest, interrogation, and crucifixion;\n# God's validation of Jesus as Christ: events from the first Easter to the Ascension, showing Jesus' death to be divinely ordained, in keeping with both scriptural promise and the nature of messiahship, and anticipating the story of {{NoteTag|For studies of the literary structure of this Gospel, see recent contributions of Bailey, Goulder and Talbert, in particular for their readings of Luke's Central Section. (Almost all scholars believe the section begins at 9.51;  strong case, however, can be put for 9.43b.) Then the introductory pieces to the opening and closing parts that frame the teaching of the Central Section would exhibit a significant dualism: compare 9.43b\u201345 and 18.31\u201335. The Central Section would then be defined as 9.43b\u201319.48, 'Jesus Journey to Jerusalem and its Temple'. Between the opening part ('His Setting out', 9.43b\u201310.24) and the closing part ('His Arriving', 18.31\u201319.48) lies a chiasm of parts 1\u20135,C,5'\u20131', 'His Teachings on the Way': 1, 10.25\u201342 Inheriting eternal life: law and love; 2, 11.1\u201313 Prayer: right praying, persistence, Holy Spirit is given; 3, 11.14\u201312.12 The Kingdom of God: what is internal is important; 4, 12.13\u201348 Earthly and Heavenly riches; the coming of the Son of Man; 5, 12.49\u201313.9 Divisions, warning and prudence, repentance; C, 13.10\u201314.24 a Sabbath healing, kingdom and entry (13.10\u201330), Jesus is to die in Jerusalem, his lament for it (13.31\u201335), a Sabbath healing, banqueting in the kingdom (14.1\u201324); 5', 14.25\u201315.32 Divisions, warning and prudence, repentance; 4', 16.1\u201331 Earthly and Heavenly riches: the coming judgement; 3', 17.1\u201337 The kingdom of God is 'within', not coming with signs; 2', 18.1\u201317 Prayer: persistence, right praying, receiving the kingdom; 1', 18.18\u201330 Inheriting eternal life: law and love.

One approach to this is through the titles Luke gives to Jesus: these include, but are not limited to, Christ ([[Messiah]]), Lord, [[Son of God]], and [[Son of Man]].{{sfn|Powell|1989|p=60}} Another is by reading Luke in the context of similar Greco-Roman divine saviour figures (Roman emperors are an example), references which would have made clear to Luke's readers that Jesus was the greatest of all saviours.{{sfn|Powell|1989|pp=63\u201365}} A third is to approach Luke through his use of the Old Testament, those passages from Jewish scripture which he cites to establish that Jesus is the promised Messiah.{{sfn|Powell|1989|p=66}} While much of this is familiar, much also is missing: for example, Luke makes no clear reference to Christ's pre-existence or to the Christian's union with Christ, and makes relatively little reference to the concept of atonement: perhaps he felt no need to mention these ideas, or disagreed with them, or possibly he was simply unaware of them.{{sfn|Buckwalter|1996|p=4}}\n\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo 023.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Annunciation'' ([[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo|Murillo]])]]\nEven what Luke does say about Christ is ambiguous or even contradictory.{{sfn|Buckwalter|1996|p=4}} For example, according to [[Luke 2:11]] Jesus was the Christ at his birth, but in {{bibleref2|Acts|10:37\u201338|NKJV}} he becomes Christ at the resurrection, while in Acts 3:20 it seems his messiahship is active only at the [[parousia]], the \"[[second coming of Christ|second coming]]\"; similarly, in Luke 2:11 he is the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Saviour]] from birth, but in {{bibleverse|Acts|5:31|KJV}} he is made Saviour at the resurrection; and he is born the [[Son of God]] in {{bibleverse|Luke|1:32\u201335|KJV}}, but becomes the Son of God at the resurrection according to {{bibleverse|Acts|13:33|KJV}}.{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=65}} Many of these differences may be due to scribal error, but others were deliberate alterations to doctrinally unacceptable passages, or the introduction by scribes of \"proofs\" for their favourite theological tenets.{{sfn|Miller|2011|p=63}} An important example of such deliberate alterations is found in Luke's account of the baptism of Jesus, where virtually all the earliest witnesses have God saying, \"This day I have begotten you.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}} (Luke has taken the words of God from [[Psalm 2]], an ancient royal adoption formula in which the king of Israel was recognised as God's elect).{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}} This reading is theologically difficult, as it implies that God is now conferring status on Jesus that he did not previously hold.{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}} It is unlikely, therefore, that the more common reading of {{bibleref2|Luke|3:22|NKJV}} (God says to Jesus, \"You are my beloved son, with you I am well pleased\") is original.{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}}\n\n===The Holy Spirit, the Christian community, and the kingdom of God===\nThe Holy Spirit plays a more important role in Luke\u2013Acts than in the other gospels. Some scholars have argued that the Spirit's involvement in the career of Jesus is paradigmatic of the universal Christian experience, others that Luke's intention was to stress Jesus' uniqueness as the Prophet of the final age.{{sfn|Powell|1989|pp=108\u201311}} It is clear, however, that Luke understands the enabling power of the Spirit, expressed through non-discriminatory fellowship (\"All who believed were together and had all things in common\"), to be the basis of the Christian community.{{sfn|Powell|1989|p=111}} This community can also be understood as the [[Kingdom of God]], although the kingdom's final consummation will not be seen till the [[Son of Man]] comes \"on a cloud\" at the end-time.{{sfn|Holladay|2011|p=no page number}}\n\n===Christians vs. Rome and the Jews===\n{{see also|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}\nLuke needed to define the position of Christians in relation to two political and social entities, the Roman Empire and Judaism. Regarding the Empire Luke makes clear that, while Christians are not a threat to the established order, the rulers of this world hold their power from Satan, and the essential loyalty of Christ's followers is to God and this world will be the kingdom of God, ruled by Christ the King.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=562}} Regarding the Jews, Luke emphasises the fact that Jesus and all his earliest followers were Jews, although by his time the majority of Christ-followers were gentiles; nevertheless, the Jews had rejected and killed the Messiah, and the Christian mission now lay with the gentiles.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=563}}\n\n==Comparison with other writings==\n[[File:1602-3 Caravaggio,Supper at Emmaus National Gallery, London.jpg|300px|left|thumb|''[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio), London|Supper at Emmaus]]'' (1601), [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]], [[National Gallery]].]]\n\n===Synoptics===\nThe gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and Luke share so much in common that they are called the [[Synoptic gospels|Synoptics]], as they frequently cover the same events in similar and sometimes identical language. The majority opinion among scholars is that Mark was the earliest of the three (about 70 AD) and that Matthew and Luke both used this work and the \"sayings gospel\" known as [[Q source|Q]] as their basic sources. Luke has both expanded Mark and refined his grammar and syntax, as Mark's Greek writing is less elegant. Some passages from Mark he has eliminated entirely, notably most of chapters 6 and 7, which he apparently felt reflected poorly on the disciples and painted Jesus too much like a magician. Despite this, he follows Mark's narrative more faithfully than does Matthew.{{sfn|Johnson|2010|p=48}}\n\n===The Gospel of John===\nDespite being grouped with Matthew and Mark, Luke's gospel has a number of parallels with the [[Gospel of John]] which are not shared by the other [[Synoptic Gospels|Synoptics]]:\n* Luke uses the terms \"Jews\" and \"Israelites\" in a way unlike Mark, but like John.\n* Both gospels contain the figures of [[Mary of Bethany]] and [[Martha]], as well as a person named Lazarus\u2014 although John's [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] is portrayed as a real person, while Luke's Lazarus appears only in a [[Rich man and Lazarus|parable]].\n* At Jesus' arrest, only Luke and John state that the servant's ''right'' ear was cut off (cf. {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:50-51}}, {{Bibleref2|John|18:10}}).\n* John shares Luke's radical concept of the master serving the slaves, which is not found in Mark or Matthew (cf. {{Bibleref2|Luke|12:37}}, {{Bibleref2|John|13:4}}).\nThere are also several other parallels that scholars have identified.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=576}} Recently, some scholars have proposed that the author of John's gospel may have specifically redacted and responded to the Gospel of Luke, in order to explain these parallels.{{sfn|MacDonald|2015}}\n\n===The Gospel of Marcion===\n{{see also|Gospel of Marcion}}\nSome time in the 2nd century, the Christian thinker [[Marcion of Sinope]] began using a gospel that was very similar to, but shorter than, canonical Luke. Marcion was well-known for preaching that the god who sent Jesus into the world was a different, higher deity than the creator god of Judaism.{{sfn|BeDuhn|2015|p=165}}\n\nWhile no manuscript copies of [[Gospel of Marcion|Marcion's gospel]] survive, reconstructions of his text have been published by [[Adolf von Harnack]] and Dieter T. Roth,{{sfn|Roth|2015}} based on quotations in the anti-[[Marcionism|Marcionite]] treatises of orthodox Christian [[Apologetics|apologists]], such as [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], and [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]]. These early apologists accused Marcion of having \"mutilated\" canonical Luke by removing material that contradicted his unorthodox theological views.{{sfn|BeDuhn|2015|p=166}} According to Tertullian, Marcion also accused his orthodox opponents of having \"falsified\" canonical Luke.{{sfn|BeDuhn|2015|p=167-168, citing Tertullian, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/evans_marc/evans_marc_10book4_eng.htm ''Adversus Marcionem'' 4.4]}}\n\nLike the [[Gospel of Mark]], Marcion's gospel lacked any nativity story, and Luke's account of the baptism of Jesus was absent. The Gospel of Marcion also omitted Luke's parables of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]] and the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son|Prodigal Son]].{{sfn|BeDuhn|2015|p=170}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Gospel}}\n* [[Authorship of Luke\u2013Acts]]\n* [[List of Gospels]]\n* [[List of omitted Bible verses]]\n* [[Marcion]]\n* [[Order of St. Luke]]\n* [[Synoptic Gospels]]\n* [[Synoptic problem]]\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#Gospel of Luke|Textual variants in the Gospel of Luke]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n|last = Adamczewski\n|first = Bartosz\n|title = Q or not Q?

The author of Luke used the [[Gospel of Mark]] as a source for the narrative of Christ's earthly life, and likely used a hypothetical sayings collection called the [[Q source]] for Jesus' teachings.{{NoteTag|\"Although the assumption of the existence of Q is nowadays accepted by the majority of scholars as the most convenient hypothesis that explains more problems and creates fewer difficulties than others do, it remains only a hypothesis that is in fact hard to prove conclusively.\" {{sfn|Adamczewski|2010|p=30}}}}{{sfn|Adamczewski|2010|p=30ff}}{{sfn|Goodacre|2002}}{{sfn|Farrer|1955}} Luke also contains material found in no other gospels, often referred to as the [[L source|L (for Luke) source]].{{sfn|Johnson|2010|p=44}}\n\nLuke\u2013Acts does not name its author.{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=196}} According to Church tradition this was [[Luke the Evangelist]], the companion of Paul, but while this view is still occasionally put forward the scholarly consensus emphasises the many contradictions between Acts and the authentic Pauline letters.{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|p=32}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2005|pp=172, 235}} The most probable date for its composition is around AD 80\u2013110, and there is evidence that it was still being revised well into the 2nd century.{{sfn|Perkins|2009|pp=250\u201353}}\n\n==Composition and setting==\n===Textual history===\n<!-- The last half of this section is partially linked from [[Biblical canon]] -->\n{{See also|Acts of the Apostles#Manuscripts}}\n\n[[File:P.

It has been dated from the late 2nd century, although this dating is disputed. Papyrus 75 (= Papyrus Bodmer XIV-XV) is another very early manuscript (late 2nd - early 3rd century), and it includes an attribution of the gospel to Luke. The oldest complete texts are the 4th century [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]], both from the Alexandrian family; [[Codex Bezae]], a 5th- or 6th-century [[Western text-type]] manuscript that contains Luke in [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] and [[Latin]] versions on facing pages, appears to have descended from an offshoot of the main manuscript tradition, departing from more familiar readings at many points. [[Codex Bezae]] shows comprehensively the differences between the versions which show no core theological significance. {{sfn|Ellis|2003|p=19}}{{NoteTag|Verses {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:19\u201320|31}} are omitted in Codex Bezae and a handful of [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] manuscripts. Nearly all other manuscripts including Codex Sinaiticus and Codex Vaticanus and Church Fathers contain the \"longer\" reading of Luke 22:19 and 20. Verse 22:20, which is very similar to {{bibleverse|1|Cor|11:25}}, and provides gospel support for the doctrine of the [[New Covenant]], along with {{bibleverse|Matthew|26:28}} and {{bibleverse|Mark|14:24}} (both, in the [[Textus Receptus]] Greek manuscript). Verses {{bibleverse-nb||Luke|22:43\u201344|31}} are found in Western text-type, are omitted by a diverse number of ancient witnesses, and are generally marked as such in modern translations.

Matthew and Luke share a large amount of additional material that is not found in Mark, and each also has a proportion of unique material.]]\n\nLuke\u2013Acts is a religio-political history of the Founder of the church and his successors, in both deeds and words. The author describes his book as a \"narrative\" (''diegesis''), rather than as a gospel, and implicitly criticises his predecessors for not giving their readers the speeches of Jesus and the Apostles, as such speeches were the mark of a \"full\" report, the vehicle through which ancient historians conveyed the meaning of their narratives. He seems to have taken as his model the works of two respected Classical authors, [[Dionysius of Halicarnassus]], who wrote a history of Rome, and the Jewish historian [[Josephus]], author of a [[Antiquities of the Jews|history of the Jews]]. All three authors anchor the histories of their respective peoples  by dating the births of the founders (Romulus, Moses, and Jesus) and narrate the stories of the founders' births from God, so that they are sons of God. Each founder taught authoritatively, appeared to witnesses after death, and ascended to heaven. Crucial aspects of the teaching of all three concerned the relationship between rich and poor and the question of whether \"foreigners\" were to be received into the people.{{sfn|Balch|2003|p=1104}}\n\nThe author of Luke used the [[Gospel of Mark]] as a source for the narrative of Christ's earthly life, and likely used a hypothetical sayings collection called the [[Q source]] for Jesus' teachings, although the existence of Q has been questioned by some scholars.{{sfn|Adamczewski|2010|p=30ff}}{{sfn|Goodacre|2002}}{{sfn|Farrer|1955}} Mark, written around 70 AD, provided the narrative outline, but Mark contains comparatively little of Jesus' teachings.{{sfn|Hurtado|2005|p=284}} For these Luke likely turned to Q, which would have consisted mostly, although not exclusively, of \"sayings\".{{sfn|Ehrman|1999|p=82}} Mark and Q account for about 64% of Luke. The remaining material, known as the [[L source]], is of unknown origin and date.{{sfn|Powell|1998|pp=39\u201340}} Most Q and L-source material is grouped in two clusters, Luke 6:17\u20138:3 and 9:51\u201318:14, and L-source material forms the first two sections of the gospel (the preface and infancy and childhood narratives).{{sfn|Burkett|2002|p=204}}\n\n===Audience and authorial intent===\nLuke was written to be read aloud to a group of Jesus-followers gathered in a house to share the Lord's supper.{{sfn|Balch|2003|p=1104}} The author assumes an educated Greek-speaking audience, but directs his attention to specifically Christian concerns rather than to the Greco-Roman world at large.{{sfn|Green|1995|pp=16\u201317}} He begins his gospel with a preface addressed to \"Theophilus\" ([[Luke 1:3]]; ''cf.'' [[Acts 1:1]]): the name means \"Lover of God,\" and could mean any Christian though most interpreters consider it a reference to a Christian convert and Luke's literary patron.{{sfn|Meier|2013|p=417}} Here he informs Theophilus of his intention, which is to lead his reader to certainty through an orderly account \"of the events that have been fulfilled among us.\"{{sfn|Green|1997|p=35}} He did not, however, intend to provide Theophilus with a historical justification of the Christian faith \u2013 \"did it happen?\" \u2013 but to encourage faith \u2013 \"what happened, and what does it all mean?\"{{sfn|Green|1997|p=36}}\n\n==Structure and content==\n{{Content of Luke}}\n\n===Structure of Luke's Gospel===\nFollowing the author's preface addressed to his patron and the two birth narratives (John the Baptist and Jesus), the gospel opens in Galilee and moves gradually to its climax in Jerusalem:{{sfn|Carroll|2012|pp=15\u201316}}\n# A brief preface addressed to Theophilus stating the author's aims;\n# Birth and infancy narratives for both Jesus and John the Baptist, interpreted as the dawn of the promised era of Israel's salvation;\n# Preparation for Jesus' messianic mission: John's prophetic mission, his baptism of Jesus, and the testing of Jesus' vocation;\n# The beginning of Jesus' mission in Galilee, and the hostile reception there;\n# The central section: the journey to Jerusalem, where Jesus knows he must meet his destiny as God's prophet and messiah;\n# His mission in Jerusalem, culminating in confrontation with the leaders of the Jewish Temple;\n# His last supper with his most intimate followers, followed by his arrest, interrogation, and crucifixion;\n# God's validation of Jesus as Christ: events from the first Easter to the Ascension, showing Jesus' death to be divinely ordained, in keeping with both scriptural promise and the nature of messiahship, and anticipating the story of {{NoteTag|For studies of the literary structure of this Gospel, see recent contributions of Bailey, Goulder and Talbert, in particular for their readings of Luke's Central Section. (Almost all scholars believe the section begins at 9.51;  strong case, however, can be put for 9.43b.) Then the introductory pieces to the opening and closing parts that frame the teaching of the Central Section would exhibit a significant dualism: compare 9.43b\u201345 and 18.31\u201335. The Central Section would then be defined as 9.43b\u201319.48, 'Jesus Journey to Jerusalem and its Temple'. Between the opening part ('His Setting out', 9.43b\u201310.24) and the closing part ('His Arriving', 18.31\u201319.48) lies a chiasm of parts 1\u20135,C,5'\u20131', 'His Teachings on the Way': 1, 10.25\u201342 Inheriting eternal life: law and love; 2, 11.1\u201313 Prayer: right praying, persistence, Holy Spirit is given; 3, 11.14\u201312.12 The Kingdom of God: what is internal is important; 4, 12.13\u201348 Earthly and Heavenly riches; the coming of the Son of Man; 5, 12.49\u201313.9 Divisions, warning and prudence, repentance; C, 13.10\u201314.24 a Sabbath healing, kingdom and entry (13.10\u201330), Jesus is to die in Jerusalem, his lament for it (13.31\u201335), a Sabbath healing, banqueting in the kingdom (14.1\u201324); 5', 14.25\u201315.32 Divisions, warning and prudence, repentance; 4', 16.1\u201331 Earthly and Heavenly riches: the coming judgement; 3', 17.1\u201337 The kingdom of God is 'within', not coming with signs; 2', 18.1\u201317 Prayer: persistence, right praying, receiving the kingdom; 1', 18.18\u201330 Inheriting eternal life: law and love.

One approach to this is through the titles Luke gives to Jesus: these include, but are not limited to, Christ ([[Messiah]]), Lord, [[Son of God]], and [[Son of Man]].{{sfn|Powell|1989|p=60}} Another is by reading Luke in the context of similar Greco-Roman divine saviour figures (Roman emperors are an example), references which would have made clear to Luke's readers that Jesus was the greatest of all saviours.{{sfn|Powell|1989|pp=63\u201365}} A third is to approach Luke through his use of the Old Testament, those passages from Jewish scripture which he cites to establish that Jesus is the promised Messiah.{{sfn|Powell|1989|p=66}} While much of this is familiar, much also is missing: for example, Luke makes no clear reference to Christ's pre-existence or to the Christian's union with Christ, and makes relatively little reference to the concept of atonement: perhaps he felt no need to mention these ideas, or disagreed with them, or possibly he was simply unaware of them.{{sfn|Buckwalter|1996|p=4}}\n\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo 023.jpg|thumb|left|upright|''Annunciation'' ([[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo|Murillo]])]]\nEven what Luke does say about Christ is ambiguous or even contradictory.{{sfn|Buckwalter|1996|p=4}} For example, according to [[Luke 2:11]] Jesus was the Christ at his birth, but in {{bibleref2|Acts|10:37\u201338|NKJV}} he becomes Christ at the resurrection, while in Acts 3:20 it seems his messiahship is active only at the [[parousia]], the \"[[second coming of Christ|second coming]]\"; similarly, in Luke 2:11 he is the [[Redeemer (Christianity)|Saviour]] from birth, but in {{bibleverse|Acts|5:31|KJV}} he is made Saviour at the resurrection; and he is born the [[Son of God]] in {{bibleverse|Luke|1:32\u201335|KJV}}, but becomes the Son of God at the resurrection according to {{bibleverse|Acts|13:33|KJV}}.{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=65}} Many of these differences may be due to scribal error, but others were deliberate alterations to doctrinally unacceptable passages, or the introduction by scribes of \"proofs\" for their favourite theological tenets.{{sfn|Miller|2011|p=63}} An important example of such deliberate alterations is found in Luke's account of the baptism of Jesus, where virtually all the earliest witnesses have God saying, \"This day I have begotten you.\"{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}} (Luke has taken the words of God from [[Psalm 2]], an ancient royal adoption formula in which the king of Israel was recognised as God's elect).{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}} This reading is theologically difficult, as it implies that God is now conferring status on Jesus that he did not previously hold.{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}} It is unlikely, therefore, that the more common reading of {{bibleref2|Luke|3:22|NKJV}} (God says to Jesus, \"You are my beloved son, with you I am well pleased\") is original.{{sfn|Ehrman|1996|p=66}}\n\n===The Holy Spirit, the Christian community, and the kingdom of God===\nThe Holy Spirit plays a more important role in Luke\u2013Acts than in the other gospels. Some scholars have argued that the Spirit's involvement in the career of Jesus is paradigmatic of the universal Christian experience, others that Luke's intention was to stress Jesus' uniqueness as the Prophet of the final age.{{sfn|Powell|1989|pp=108\u201311}} It is clear, however, that Luke understands the enabling power of the Spirit, expressed through non-discriminatory fellowship (\"All who believed were together and had all things in common\"), to be the basis of the Christian community.{{sfn|Powell|1989|p=111}} This community can also be understood as the [[Kingdom of God]], although the kingdom's final consummation will not be seen till the [[Son of Man]] comes \"on a cloud\" at the end-time.{{sfn|Holladay|2011|p=no page number}}\n\n===Christians vs. Rome and the Jews===\n{{see also|History of the Jews in the Roman Empire}}\nLuke needed to define the position of Christians in relation to two political and social entities, the Roman Empire and Judaism. Regarding the Empire Luke makes clear that, while Christians are not a threat to the established order, the rulers of this world hold their power from Satan, and the essential loyalty of Christ's followers is to God and this world will be the kingdom of God, ruled by Christ the King.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=562}} Regarding the Jews, Luke emphasises the fact that Jesus and all his earliest followers were Jews, although by his time the majority of Christ-followers were gentiles; nevertheless, the Jews had rejected and killed the Messiah, and the Christian mission now lay with the gentiles.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=563}}\n\n==Comparison with other writings==\n[[File:1602-3 Caravaggio,Supper at Emmaus National Gallery, London.jpg|300px|left|thumb|''[[Supper at Emmaus (Caravaggio), London|Supper at Emmaus]]'' (1601), [[Michelangelo Merisi|Caravaggio]], [[National Gallery]].]]\n\n===Synoptics===\nThe gospels of [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]] and Luke share so much in common that they are called the [[Synoptic gospels|Synoptics]], as they frequently cover the same events in similar and sometimes identical language. The majority opinion among scholars is that Mark was the earliest of the three (about 70 AD) and that Matthew and Luke both used this work and the \"sayings gospel\" known as [[Q source|Q]] as their basic sources. Luke has both expanded Mark and refined his grammar and syntax, as Mark's Greek writing is less elegant. Some passages from Mark he has eliminated entirely, notably most of chapters 6 and 7, which he apparently felt reflected poorly on the disciples and painted Jesus too much like a magician. Despite this, he follows Mark's narrative more faithfully than does Matthew.{{sfn|Johnson|2010|p=48}}\n\n===The Gospel of John===\nDespite being grouped with Matthew and Mark, Luke's gospel has a number of parallels with the [[Gospel of John]] which are not shared by the other [[Synoptic Gospels|Synoptics]]:\n* Luke uses the terms \"Jews\" and \"Israelites\" in a way unlike Mark, but like John.\n* Both gospels contain the figures of [[Mary of Bethany]] and [[Martha]], as well as a person named Lazarus\u2014 although John's [[Lazarus of Bethany|Lazarus]] is portrayed as a real person, while Luke's Lazarus appears only in a [[Rich man and Lazarus|parable]].\n* At Jesus' arrest, only Luke and John state that the servant's ''right'' ear was cut off (cf. {{Bibleref2|Luke|22:50-51}}, {{Bibleref2|John|18:10}}).\n* John shares Luke's radical concept of the master serving the slaves, which is not found in Mark or Matthew (cf. {{Bibleref2|Luke|12:37}}, {{Bibleref2|John|13:4}}).\nThere are also several other parallels that scholars have identified.{{sfn|Boring|2012|p=576}} Recently, some scholars have proposed that the author of John's gospel may have specifically redacted and responded to the Gospel of Luke, in order to explain these parallels.{{sfn|MacDonald|2015}}\n\n===The Gospel of Marcion===\n{{see also|Gospel of Marcion}}\nSome time in the 2nd century, the Christian thinker [[Marcion of Sinope]] began using a gospel that was very similar to, but shorter than, canonical Luke. Marcion was well-known for preaching that the god who sent Jesus into the world was a different, higher deity than the creator god of Judaism.{{sfn|BeDuhn|2015|p=165}}\n\nWhile no manuscript copies of [[Gospel of Marcion|Marcion's gospel]] survive, reconstructions of his text have been published by [[Adolf von Harnack]] and Dieter T. Roth,{{sfn|Roth|2015}} based on quotations in the anti-[[Marcionism|Marcionite]] treatises of orthodox Christian [[Apologetics|apologists]], such as [[Irenaeus]], [[Tertullian]], and [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]]. These early apologists accused Marcion of having \"mutilated\" canonical Luke by removing material that contradicted his unorthodox theological views.{{sfn|BeDuhn|2015|p=166}} According to Tertullian, Marcion also accused his orthodox opponents of having \"falsified\" canonical Luke.{{sfn|BeDuhn|2015|p=167-168, citing Tertullian, [http://www.tertullian.org/articles/evans_marc/evans_marc_10book4_eng.htm ''Adversus Marcionem'' 4.4]}}\n\nLike the [[Gospel of Mark]], Marcion's gospel lacked any nativity story, and Luke's account of the baptism of Jesus was absent. The Gospel of Marcion also omitted Luke's parables of the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan|Good Samaritan]] and the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son|Prodigal Son]].{{sfn|BeDuhn|2015|p=170}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books|Gospel}}\n* [[Authorship of Luke\u2013Acts]]\n* [[List of Gospels]]\n* [[List of omitted Bible verses]]\n* [[Marcion]]\n* [[Order of St. Luke]]\n* [[Synoptic Gospels]]\n* [[Synoptic problem]]\n* [[Textual variants in the New Testament#Gospel of Luke|Textual variants in the Gospel of Luke]]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|20em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book\n|last = Adamczewski\n|first = Bartosz\n|title = Q or not Q?
