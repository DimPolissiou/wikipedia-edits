The English translation of the team's name is ''Football Club Freedom''.\n\nThe club is a member of the [[Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and has been active in the [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] since it was founded, an exception being a two-year stint of playing in the [[First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] after the club got relegated to it in the [[2011\u201312 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2011\u201312 Premier League]] season.\n\nSloboda got promoted back up to the Premier League in the [[2013\u201314 First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2013\u201314 First League of FBiH]] season, and has been playing in the country's top division since.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nFK Sloboda Tuzla was founded in October 1919, as a part of the Labour Sport Society ''Gorki'', named after the great socialist [[Russia]]n poet [[Maxim Gorky]]. The football club and the labour society was popular in a wide part of the sporting public in Tuzla and beyond. The club was formed on the initiative of the Tuzla branch of the newly formed [[KPJ|Communist party of Yugoslavia]], under the influence of the ideas of the [[October revolution]] of 1917 and revolutionary movements in [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as its integral part.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nAfter the initial congress of unification and the creation of the [[KPJ|Socialist Labour Party (Communists)]] in Yugoslavia that took place in [[Vukovar]], [[Croatia]] in 1919, the first conference of the Tuzla municipal organisation of the [[KPJ|SWPY(c)]] took place on 17 October 1919 in Tuzla. The elected party council decided on the same day to start with the formation of a worker's sporting society. The official founding of the club took place in the end of October 1919, and gathering was led by Jovo Sretenovi\u0107, Mato Vidovi\u0107, Safet Had\u017eiefendi\u0107, Ljubko Simi\u0107, Niko Trifkovi\u0107 and Petar Dugonji\u0107.<ref name=Monografija>''RSD Sloboda Tuzla 1919\u20131989'', a monography commemorating 70 years of the club</ref>\n\nThe men elected into the first Board of directors of the club were: Leonard Bancher, Mato Vidovi\u0107, Niko Trifkovi\u0107, Stjepan Brklja\u010di\u0107 and Alfred Puhta, Mijo Cuvaj and Ahmed Mand\u017ei\u0107, Franto Bauzek (locksmith), Emil Kranj\u010dec, Jakov \u010curi\u0107 and Petar Dugonji\u0107, Franjo Mi\u0161kovski, Safet Had\u017eiefendi\u0107, August Mot and Karlo Schwartz. The origin of the original name of the sporting society, ''Gorki'', was explained by Petar Dugonji\u0107:\n\n''When the final preparations for the organising meeting were being dealt with, it was suggested that the club be named ''Sokolovi\u0107'', after [[Mi\u0107o Sokolovi\u0107]], a known worker's rights activist. Then Mitar Trifunovi\u0107 noticed: \"People, few will know that we named the Club after our Mi\u0107a. Most will think of [[Mehmed-pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107]]\". The practical Franjo Reza\u010d insisted we go to the meeting with a concrete name suggestion. Mitar Trifunovi\u0107 then said: \"If no one objects, I would suggest the club bears the name of Maxim Gorky\". I remember it well. Afterwards the name was accepted with enthusiasm at the meeting.''<ref name=Monografija/>\n\nThe first headquarters of the club was in Rudarska Street in Tuzla, not far from Skver is today. Afterwards the headquarters moved to the building of the Jewish Bank, then to the Grand Hotel and then back to Rudarska Street. The games were played on two fields&nbsp;\u2013 the first one was called the ''Communist playground'' between what today are the Chemical and Mechanical high-schools and the second one was the field where the Bra\u0107a Ribar primary schools stands.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nAll the players were workers, and the ''Gorki'' first team had the following players: Mirko Veseli, Peri Mot, Karlo Krej\u010di, Santo Altarac, Ivica \u0160ifer, Franto Bauzek, Mijo Josi\u0107, Lorenc Ajhberger, Vili Zabo\u0161, Slavko Zafani, Ahmed Mand\u017ei\u0107, Alfred Puhta, Jozo Viki\u0107, Malaga Musta\u010devi\u0107, Dragoslav Staki\u0107 and several others. The coach was Brato Gamberger, former player of H\u0160K Zrinjski.<ref name=Monografija/>\n\nThe club mostly played against other Tuzla football clubs. Namely, at the time of the formation of FK Gorki there were three other football clubs in Tuzla, ''Zrinjski'', ''Obili\u0107'' and ''Makabi'', based around the Croatian, Serbian and Jewish population of Tuzla. In 1921 the [[Bosnia]]k club ''Bura'' was also formed. Unlike these confessional clubs, FK Gorki was multinational and accepted members of all faiths and ethnicities.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nIt is important to note that the official ground of Tuzla in this period was the field of H\u0160K Zrinjski built in 1928 on the road to Solina from Br\u010danska Malta with the help of Kalman Liska, a wood merchant and president of H\u0160K Zrinjski.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n{{wide image|TZstadium.png|900px|Panoramic view of the stadium}}\n\n===FK Sloboda===\nIn 1924, because of the country-wide ban of communist activities, FK Gorki was banned by the government of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] under the orders of the infamous ''Obznana''. There was an attempt to form another worker's club, called ''Hajduk'', but this was also banned in 1924.\n\n====Foundation and activity between 1927 and 1941====\nThanks to the perseverance of labour activists, on 20 November 1927 the ''Labour-cultural and sporting society'' '''Sloboda''' (Bosnian: ''Radni\u010dko-kulturno sportsko dru\u0161tvo Sloboda'') was formed in Tuzla. The society initially had four sections: Sports, [[Tamburica]], Choir and Amateur theatre. The first team of the sports section was: Karlo Mot, Nikola Kemenc, Suljo Nezirovi\u0107, Alfred Puhta, Safet and E\u0161o Isabegovi\u0107, Oto and Ivica Milinovi\u0107, Josip Leder and Muho Mujezinovi\u0107, Karlo Schwartz, Vlado Mileusni\u0107, Jozo Kemenc, Rihard \u017dlebnik, Mujo Begi\u0107 and many others.\n\nIn the beginning of 1928, the sports section becomes independent and renames itself to '''RSK Sloboda'''. Although officially under the influence of social-democrats, communists continue to have a substantial influence in the club, hence it is a continuation of the formerly banned FK Gorki. That is the reason the year of foundation is always considered to be 1919, the year when Gorki was formed and not 1928. The first game played by the new club was against FK Solvaj from Lukavac. Because of the discontinuation of several other Tuzla football clubs, like Obili\u0107 nad Bura, many players transferred to Sloboda and in 1928 it had a formidable team that consisted of the following players: Asim Mulaosmanovi\u0107, Muho Mujeznovi\u0107, Dejan Vujasinovi\u0107, Mujko Me\u0161kovi\u0107, [[Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107]], Abdurahman Mujezinovi\u0107 Smrt, Vlado Mileusni\u0107, Karlo Mot, Ivan Majer and others. It is a very interesting fact that Mehmed Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107, one of the greatest [[Bosniak]] writers of all time, played in Sloboda at this period.\n\n====Re-foundation in SFRY and rise to the top 1945\u20131992====\nDuring the time of [[SFRY|former Yugoslavia]], FK Sloboda was active in the [[Yugoslav First League]] and the team had much success, despite never winning the title. The best result was achieved in 1977 when FC Sloboda has qualified for the UEFA cup 1977\u201378. Unfortunately, Las Palmas from Spain was stronger, 5\u20130 in Spain for Las Palmas and 4\u20133 for FK Sloboda in Tuzla. This is a club with very rich history in former Yugoslavia giving many stars such as Mesud Nali\u0107, [[Omer Jusi\u0107]], [[Rizah Me\u0161kovi\u0107]], Mersed Kova\u010devi\u0107, [[Fuad Mulahasanovi\u0107]], [[Ismet Had\u017ei\u0107]], [[D\u017eevad \u0160e\u0107erbegovi\u0107]], [[Mustafa Huki\u0107]], Midhat Memi\u0161evi\u0107 as well as young players members of U-20 national team such as Isanovi\u0107, \u0106ulumarevi\u0107, Milo\u0161evi\u0107, Hajrulahovi\u0107, Jogun\u010di\u0107.\n\n===Bosnian First League 1993\u20132000===\nIn 1991 Sloboda was to be relegated from 1st Yugoslav league, but after Croatian and Slovenian teams left Yugoslav 1st league Sloboda was there for season 1992 but left league with \u017deljezni\u010dar, Sarajevo and Vele\u017e after breakout of war. Until 2000 Sloboda played First League of NFSBiH, after 2000 Sloboda played Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nSeason 1994\u20131995 was first season of Bosnian First League, Sloboda won Tuzla Group but lost in First Play-off Round from Bosna Visoko,and reached finals of National Cup, but lost to \u010celik Zenica.\n\nNext season saw Sloboda winning third place in League, top scorer was Nedim Omerovi\u0107 with 17 goals, same thing happens again in Cup, losing to \u010celik.\n\nIn season 1996\u20131997 Sloboda declined and ended up tenth in First League. In Season 1997\u20131998 Sloboda missed Championship Playoff with Croat teams by 3 points.\n\nSeason 1998\u20131999 was turbulent one, by the end of first half of championship Sloboda was in relegation zone, on winter Mustafa Huki\u0107 took club over and made great success by reaching fifth place.\n\nSeason 1999\u20132000 started with huge expectations, fans expected great things, but on 7 August manager of Sloboda Mustafa Huki\u0107 died in car crash, and Sloboda ended up in 7th place and runner up in 3 team finals of National Cup.\n\nNumber of great players played for team during these years such as [[Vedin Musi\u0107]], [[Muhamed Konji\u0107]], Sakib Malko\u010devi\u0107, Nedim Omerovi\u0107.\n\n===Premier League, decline and relegation 2000\u20132012===\n\n====First League of FBiH (2nd tier of Bosnian football), back in top flight 2014\u2013present====\n\nAfter 42 years, Sloboda got relegated from the top divisions (including both, Yugoslav and Bosnian football) to the [[First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|First League of FBiH]] in the [[2011\u201312 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2011\u201312 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina season]]. They came back after their 2nd season of being relegated. In their first season after getting back to the top tier ([[2014\u201315 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2014\u201315]]), Sloboda finished at 8th place, recording the 2nd best performance of the spring part of the season (8\u20134\u20133).\n\nSloboda was the league leader of the first part of the [[2015\u201316 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2015\u201316 Bosnian Premier League season]]. Until March 2016, the team were on an 18-game unbeaten run in the [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] dating back to 18 November 2015. The club took 2nd league place that season, managing also to achieve the Bosnian Cup final which was lost by Radnik Bijeljina (11 May \u2013 Tuzla: 1\u20131, 18 May \u2013 Bijeljina: 0\u20133).\n\nThe season [[2016\u201317 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2016\u201317]] was followed by turbulence. The club's board changed when Azmir Husi\u0107 decided to leave the chairman seat in September and was replaced with Senad Mujkanovi\u0107. The club took 5th place in the league at the end. That season left the fans with memories on one of the best come backs when Sloboda hosted [[H\u0160K Zrinjski Mostar|Zrinjski Mostar]] on 19 November 2016. Zrinski had 3\u20130 after 51 minutes, but the Tuzla-based team managed to tie the game in the end in only 18 minutes.\n\nThe [[2017\u201318 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2017\u201318]] league season was entire to forget when the club took 10th position, just one place above relegation zone. However, through the [[2017\u201318 Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup|2017\u201318 Bosnian Cup]], under the guidance of then manager [[Slavko Petrovi\u0107]], Sloboda made it all the way to the [[2017\u201318 Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup#Semi final|semi-finals]], losing 4\u20131 on aggregate to eventual winner, [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/zeljeznicar-protutnjao-tuzlom-i-zakazao-finale-kupa-bih-s-krupom/180418122|title=\u017deljezni\u010dar protutnjao Tuzlom i zakazao finale Kupa BiH s Krupom|date=18 April 2018|accessdate=18 April 2018|language=Bosnian|author=N.K.|publisher=Klix.ba}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 March 2019, the club chairman, Senad Mujkanovi\u0107 left Sloboda and, Sead Kozli\u0107 was named for the new club's chairman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/skupstina-razrijesila-mujkanovica-kozlic-novi-predsjednik-slobode/190329128|title=Skup\u0161tina razrije\u0161ila Mujkanovi\u0107a, Kozli\u0107 novi predsjednik Slobode|date=29 March 2019|accessdate=29 March 2019|language=Bosnian|publisher=Klix.ba}}</ref> Not even seven months after Kozli\u0107 was named as the new chairman, on 15 October 2019, Kozli\u0107 decided to step down from the position<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/sead-kozlic-podnio-neopozivu-ostavku-na-mjestu-predsjednika-uo-fk-sloboda/337124|title=Sead Kozli\u0107 podnio neopozivu ostavku na mjestu predsjednika UO FK Sloboda|date=15 October 2019|accessdate=15 October 2019|language=Bosnian|author=E. \u010cau\u0161evi\u0107|publisher=sportsport.ba}}</ref>, while on the next day, October 16, Elmir \u0160e\u0107erbegovi\u0107 became the new FK Sloboda Tuzla club chairman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/izabran-novi-predsjednik-uo-fk-sloboda/337288|title=Izabran novi predsjednik UO FK Sloboda|date=16 October 2019|accessdate=16 October 2019|language=Bosnian|author=R.

The English translation of the team's name is ''Football Club Freedom''.\n\nThe club is a member of the [[Football Association of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and has been active in the [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] since it was founded, an exception being a two-year stint of playing in the [[First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] after the club got relegated to it in the [[2011\u201312 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2011\u201312 Premier League]] season.\n\nSloboda got promoted back up to the Premier League in the [[2013\u201314 First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2013\u201314 First League of FBiH]] season, and has been playing in the country's top division since.\n\n==History==\n===Foundation===\nFK Sloboda Tuzla was founded in October 1919, as a part of the Labour Sport Society ''Gorki'', named after the great socialist [[Russia]]n poet [[Maxim Gorky]]. The football club and the labour society was popular in a wide part of the sporting public in Tuzla and beyond. The club was formed on the initiative of the Tuzla branch of the newly formed [[KPJ|Communist party of Yugoslavia]], under the influence of the ideas of the [[October revolution]] of 1917 and revolutionary movements in [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] as its integral part.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nAfter the initial congress of unification and the creation of the [[KPJ|Socialist Labour Party (Communists)]] in Yugoslavia that took place in [[Vukovar]], [[Croatia]] in 1919, the first conference of the Tuzla municipal organisation of the [[KPJ|SWPY(c)]] took place on 17 October 1919 in Tuzla. The elected party council decided on the same day to start with the formation of a worker's sporting society. The official founding of the club took place in the end of October 1919, and gathering was led by Jovo Sretenovi\u0107, Mato Vidovi\u0107, Safet Had\u017eiefendi\u0107, Ljubko Simi\u0107, Niko Trifkovi\u0107 and Petar Dugonji\u0107.<ref name=Monografija>''RSD Sloboda Tuzla 1919\u20131989'', a monography commemorating 70 years of the club</ref>\n\nThe men elected into the first Board of directors of the club were: Leonard Bancher, Mato Vidovi\u0107, Niko Trifkovi\u0107, Stjepan Brklja\u010di\u0107 and Alfred Puhta, Mijo Cuvaj and Ahmed Mand\u017ei\u0107, Franto Bauzek (locksmith), Emil Kranj\u010dec, Jakov \u010curi\u0107 and Petar Dugonji\u0107, Franjo Mi\u0161kovski, Safet Had\u017eiefendi\u0107, August Mot and Karlo Schwartz. The origin of the original name of the sporting society, ''Gorki'', was explained by Petar Dugonji\u0107:\n\n''When the final preparations for the organising meeting were being dealt with, it was suggested that the club be named ''Sokolovi\u0107'', after [[Mi\u0107o Sokolovi\u0107]], a known worker's rights activist. Then Mitar Trifunovi\u0107 noticed: \"People, few will know that we named the Club after our Mi\u0107a. Most will think of [[Mehmed-pa\u0161a Sokolovi\u0107]]\". The practical Franjo Reza\u010d insisted we go to the meeting with a concrete name suggestion. Mitar Trifunovi\u0107 then said: \"If no one objects, I would suggest the club bears the name of Maxim Gorky\". I remember it well. Afterwards the name was accepted with enthusiasm at the meeting.''<ref name=Monografija/>\n\nThe first headquarters of the club was in Rudarska Street in Tuzla, not far from Skver is today. Afterwards the headquarters moved to the building of the Jewish Bank, then to the Grand Hotel and then back to Rudarska Street. The games were played on two fields&nbsp;\u2013 the first one was called the ''Communist playground'' between what today are the Chemical and Mechanical high-schools and the second one was the field where the Bra\u0107a Ribar primary schools stands.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nAll the players were workers, and the ''Gorki'' first team had the following players: Mirko Veseli, Peri Mot, Karlo Krej\u010di, Santo Altarac, Ivica \u0160ifer, Franto Bauzek, Mijo Josi\u0107, Lorenc Ajhberger, Vili Zabo\u0161, Slavko Zafani, Ahmed Mand\u017ei\u0107, Alfred Puhta, Jozo Viki\u0107, Malaga Musta\u010devi\u0107, Dragoslav Staki\u0107 and several others. The coach was Brato Gamberger, former player of H\u0160K Zrinjski.<ref name=Monografija/>\n\nThe club mostly played against other Tuzla football clubs. Namely, at the time of the formation of FK Gorki there were three other football clubs in Tuzla, ''Zrinjski'', ''Obili\u0107'' and ''Makabi'', based around the Croatian, Serbian and Jewish population of Tuzla. In 1921 the [[Bosnia]]k club ''Bura'' was also formed. Unlike these confessional clubs, FK Gorki was multinational and accepted members of all faiths and ethnicities.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\nIt is important to note that the official ground of Tuzla in this period was the field of H\u0160K Zrinjski built in 1928 on the road to Solina from Br\u010danska Malta with the help of Kalman Liska, a wood merchant and president of H\u0160K Zrinjski.{{fact|date=November 2019}}\n\n{{wide image|TZstadium.png|900px|Panoramic view of the stadium}}\n\n===FK Sloboda===\nIn 1924, because of the country-wide ban of communist activities, FK Gorki was banned by the government of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] under the orders of the infamous ''Obznana''. There was an attempt to form another worker's club, called ''Hajduk'', but this was also banned in 1924.\n\n====Foundation and activity between 1927 and 1941====\nThanks to the perseverance of labour activists, on 20 November 1927 the ''Labour-cultural and sporting society'' '''Sloboda''' (Bosnian: ''Radni\u010dko-kulturno sportsko dru\u0161tvo Sloboda'') was formed in Tuzla. The society initially had four sections: Sports, [[Tamburica]], Choir and Amateur theatre. The first team of the sports section was: Karlo Mot, Nikola Kemenc, Suljo Nezirovi\u0107, Alfred Puhta, Safet and E\u0161o Isabegovi\u0107, Oto and Ivica Milinovi\u0107, Josip Leder and Muho Mujezinovi\u0107, Karlo Schwartz, Vlado Mileusni\u0107, Jozo Kemenc, Rihard \u017dlebnik, Mujo Begi\u0107 and many others.\n\nIn the beginning of 1928, the sports section becomes independent and renames itself to '''RSK Sloboda'''. Although officially under the influence of social-democrats, communists continue to have a substantial influence in the club, hence it is a continuation of the formerly banned FK Gorki. That is the reason the year of foundation is always considered to be 1919, the year when Gorki was formed and not 1928. The first game played by the new club was against FK Solvaj from Lukavac. Because of the discontinuation of several other Tuzla football clubs, like Obili\u0107 nad Bura, many players transferred to Sloboda and in 1928 it had a formidable team that consisted of the following players: Asim Mulaosmanovi\u0107, Muho Mujeznovi\u0107, Dejan Vujasinovi\u0107, Mujko Me\u0161kovi\u0107, [[Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107]], Abdurahman Mujezinovi\u0107 Smrt, Vlado Mileusni\u0107, Karlo Mot, Ivan Majer and others. It is a very interesting fact that Mehmed Me\u0161a Selimovi\u0107, one of the greatest [[Bosniak]] writers of all time, played in Sloboda at this period.\n\n====Re-foundation in SFRY and rise to the top 1945\u20131992====\nDuring the time of [[SFRY|former Yugoslavia]], FK Sloboda was active in the [[Yugoslav First League]] and the team had much success, despite never winning the title. The best result was achieved in 1977 when FC Sloboda has qualified for the UEFA cup 1977\u201378. Unfortunately, Las Palmas from Spain was stronger, 5\u20130 in Spain for Las Palmas and 4\u20133 for FK Sloboda in Tuzla. This is a club with very rich history in former Yugoslavia giving many stars such as Mesud Nali\u0107, [[Omer Jusi\u0107]], [[Rizah Me\u0161kovi\u0107]], Mersed Kova\u010devi\u0107, [[Fuad Mulahasanovi\u0107]], [[Ismet Had\u017ei\u0107]], [[D\u017eevad \u0160e\u0107erbegovi\u0107]], [[Mustafa Huki\u0107]], Midhat Memi\u0161evi\u0107 as well as young players members of U-20 national team such as Isanovi\u0107, \u0106ulumarevi\u0107, Milo\u0161evi\u0107, Hajrulahovi\u0107, Jogun\u010di\u0107.\n\n===Bosnian First League 1993\u20132000===\nIn 1991 Sloboda was to be relegated from 1st Yugoslav league, but after Croatian and Slovenian teams left Yugoslav 1st league Sloboda was there for season 1992 but left league with \u017deljezni\u010dar, Sarajevo and Vele\u017e after breakout of war. Until 2000 Sloboda played First League of NFSBiH, after 2000 Sloboda played Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina.\n\nSeason 1994\u20131995 was first season of Bosnian First League, Sloboda won Tuzla Group but lost in First Play-off Round from Bosna Visoko,and reached finals of National Cup, but lost to \u010celik Zenica.\n\nNext season saw Sloboda winning third place in League, top scorer was Nedim Omerovi\u0107 with 17 goals, same thing happens again in Cup, losing to \u010celik.\n\nIn season 1996\u20131997 Sloboda declined and ended up tenth in First League. In Season 1997\u20131998 Sloboda missed Championship Playoff with Croat teams by 3 points.\n\nSeason 1998\u20131999 was turbulent one, by the end of first half of championship Sloboda was in relegation zone, on winter Mustafa Huki\u0107 took club over and made great success by reaching fifth place.\n\nSeason 1999\u20132000 started with huge expectations, fans expected great things, but on 7 August manager of Sloboda Mustafa Huki\u0107 died in car crash, and Sloboda ended up in 7th place and runner up in 3 team finals of National Cup.\n\nNumber of great players played for team during these years such as [[Vedin Musi\u0107]], [[Muhamed Konji\u0107]], Sakib Malko\u010devi\u0107, Nedim Omerovi\u0107.\n\n===Premier League, decline and relegation 2000\u20132012===\n\n====First League of FBiH (2nd tier of Bosnian football), back in top flight 2014\u2013present====\n\nAfter 42 years, Sloboda got relegated from the top divisions (including both, Yugoslav and Bosnian football) to the [[First League of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|First League of FBiH]] in the [[2011\u201312 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2011\u201312 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina season]]. They came back after their 2nd season of being relegated. In their first season after getting back to the top tier ([[2014\u201315 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2014\u201315]]), Sloboda finished at 8th place, recording the 2nd best performance of the spring part of the season (8\u20134\u20133).\n\nSloboda was the league leader of the first part of the [[2015\u201316 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2015\u201316 Bosnian Premier League season]]. Until March 2016, the team were on an 18-game unbeaten run in the [[Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] dating back to 18 November 2015. The club took 2nd league place that season, managing also to achieve the Bosnian Cup final which was lost by Radnik Bijeljina (11 May \u2013 Tuzla: 1\u20131, 18 May \u2013 Bijeljina: 0\u20133).\n\nThe season [[2016\u201317 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2016\u201317]] was followed by turbulence. The club's board changed when Azmir Husi\u0107 decided to leave the chairman seat in September and was replaced with Senad Mujkanovi\u0107. The club took 5th place in the league at the end. That season left the fans with memories on one of the best come backs when Sloboda hosted [[H\u0160K Zrinjski Mostar|Zrinjski Mostar]] on 19 November 2016. Zrinski had 3\u20130 after 51 minutes, but the Tuzla-based team managed to tie the game in the end in only 18 minutes.\n\nThe [[2017\u201318 Premier League of Bosnia and Herzegovina|2017\u201318]] league season was entire to forget when the club took 10th position, just one place above relegation zone. However, through the [[2017\u201318 Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup|2017\u201318 Bosnian Cup]], under the guidance of then manager [[Slavko Petrovi\u0107]], Sloboda made it all the way to the [[2017\u201318 Bosnia and Herzegovina Football Cup#Semi final|semi-finals]], losing 4\u20131 on aggregate to eventual winner, [[FK \u017deljezni\u010dar Sarajevo|\u017deljezni\u010dar]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/zeljeznicar-protutnjao-tuzlom-i-zakazao-finale-kupa-bih-s-krupom/180418122|title=\u017deljezni\u010dar protutnjao Tuzlom i zakazao finale Kupa BiH s Krupom|date=18 April 2018|accessdate=18 April 2018|language=Bosnian|author=N.K.|publisher=Klix.ba}}</ref>\n\nOn 29 March 2019, the club chairman, Senad Mujkanovi\u0107 left Sloboda and, Sead Kozli\u0107 was named for the new club's chairman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.klix.ba/sport/nogomet/skupstina-razrijesila-mujkanovica-kozlic-novi-predsjednik-slobode/190329128|title=Skup\u0161tina razrije\u0161ila Mujkanovi\u0107a, Kozli\u0107 novi predsjednik Slobode|date=29 March 2019|accessdate=29 March 2019|language=Bosnian|publisher=Klix.ba}}</ref> Not even seven months after Kozli\u0107 was named as the new chairman, on 15 October 2019, Kozli\u0107 decided to step down from the position<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/sead-kozlic-podnio-neopozivu-ostavku-na-mjestu-predsjednika-uo-fk-sloboda/337124|title=Sead Kozli\u0107 podnio neopozivu ostavku na mjestu predsjednika UO FK Sloboda|date=15 October 2019|accessdate=15 October 2019|language=Bosnian|author=E. \u010cau\u0161evi\u0107|publisher=sportsport.ba}}</ref>, while on the next day, October 16, Elmir \u0160e\u0107erbegovi\u0107 became the new FK Sloboda Tuzla club chairman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sportsport.ba/fudbal/izabran-novi-predsjednik-uo-fk-sloboda/337288|title=Izabran novi predsjednik UO FK Sloboda|date=16 October 2019|accessdate=16 October 2019|language=Bosnian|author=R.

Through the elimination of territories ruled by [[prince-bishop]]s ([[secularisation]]) and through the [[German mediatization|consolidation of neighbouring principalities, enclaves and exclaves]], Napoleon reduced several hundred states into a relative concentration of a little over two dozen states in the [[Confederation of the Rhine]].

[[Prussia]] and the [[Austrian Empire]]\u2014the successor state to the Habsburg Monarchy\u2014were the only major German powers, and neither had been part of the Confederation of the Rhine. The victorious allies, including Prussia and Austria, decided at the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1814\u201315) on widespread dynastic [[European Restoration|restorations]], although some of Napoleon's consolidations were maintained, and Austria and Prussia helped themselves to some formerly independent territories. The resulting territorial division resulted in a consolidated version\u2014around 40 states\u2014of the pre-Napoleonic ''Kleinstaaterei''.\n\nThe rise of [[nationalism]] across Europe brought movements striving for \"[[Nation state|nation-states]]\", each governing an entire (ethno-cultural) [[Race (human classification)|people]].

The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], who defeated an army commanded by [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to Constantinople and established his court there.\n\nThe capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.\n\nIt was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of [[gunpowder]] (which powered formidable cannons).<ref name=\"econfallmill\" />\n\nThe conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event in the [[Late Middle Ages]] which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.<ref name=\"GpAG8\" />\n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century. Thessaloniki was captured by the Ottomans in 1430. A few islands in the Aegean and the [[Propontis]] remained under Byzantine rule until 1453 (not shown on the map).]]\n\nIn the summer of 1452, when [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumel\u0131 Hisari]] was completed and the threat had become imminent, Constantine wrote to the Pope, promising to implement the Union, which was declared valid by a half-hearted imperial court on 12 December 1452.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}} Although he was eager for an advantage, Pope Nicholas V did not have the influence the Byzantines thought he had over the Western kings and princes, some of whom were wary of increasing papal control, and these had not the wherewithal to contribute to the effort, especially in light of the weakened state of France and England from the [[Hundred Years' War]], Spain, being in the final part of the [[Reconquista]], the internecine fighting in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and Hungary and Poland's defeat at the [[Battle of Varna]] of 1444. Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength.

This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards.

The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn.

As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers.

The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. The sea walls at the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]] were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under [[Gabriele Trevisano]].<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nTwo tactical reserves were kept behind in the city, one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], under the command of [[Loukas Notaras]] and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively. The Venetian Alviso Diedo commanded the ships in the harbour.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94}}\n\nAlthough the Byzantines also had cannons, they were much smaller than those of the Ottomans and the [[recoil]] tended to damage their own walls.<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" />\n\nAccording to [[David Nicolle]], despite many odds, the idea that Constantinople was inevitably doomed is wrong, and the overall situation was not as one-sided as a simple glance at a map might suggest.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|40}} It has also been claimed that Constantinople was \"the best-defended city in Europe\" at that time.<ref name=\"bZgqW\" />\n\n==Siege==\nAt the beginning of the siege, Mehmed sent out some of his best troops to reduce the remaining Byzantine strongholds outside the city of Constantinople. The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days.

Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships{{NoteTag|These were the three Genoese ships sent by the Pope, joined by a large Imperial transport ship which had been sent on a foraging mission to Sicily previous to the siege and was on its way back to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|100}}}} managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.\n\nMehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across [[Galata]] on the north side of the Golden Horn, and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} This seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the\u2014nominally neutral\u2014colony of [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], and demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using [[fire ship]]s, but the Ottomans forced the Christians to retreat with heavy losses. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore.  On orders of Mehmed, they were [[Impalement|impaled]] on stakes, in sight of the city's defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|108}}<ref name=\"MoRBA\" /> With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.\n\nThe Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but were always repelled with heavy losses.<ref name=\"FdrIR\" /> Venetian surgeon [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]], describing in his diary one of such frequent land attacks especially by the Janissaries, wrote:\n\n{{quote|They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries&nbsp;... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones&nbsp;... without caring how near they came to the city walls.

However, an engineer named [[Johannes Grant]], a German{{NoteTag|[[Steven Runciman|Runciman]] speculates that he may have been Scottish<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|84}}}} who came together with the Genoese contingent, had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, and destroyed with [[Greek fire]] and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref name=\"TQ2Lp\" />\n\nOn 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city. Constantine XI only agreed to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possession.\n\n{{quote|As to surrendering the city to you, it is not for me to decide or for anyone else of its citizens; for all of us have reached the mutual decision to die of our own free will, without any regard for our lives.{{NoteTag|Original text: \u03a4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u1fd6 \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f10\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3\u2022 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1fc7 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u1fc3 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd.<ref name=\"29maiouiefemerida\" />}}}}\n\nAround this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers.

[[Zagan Pasha]] argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack.

This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the eleventh century, and was much weaker. The [[Anatolians]] managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders.

The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defence collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]] pressed forward.

Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn.

The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn.

After the doors were breached, the troops separated the congregation according to what price they might bring in the slave markets.\n\nOttoman casualties are unknown but they are believed by most historians to be very heavy due to several unsuccessful Ottoman attacks made during the siege and final assault.{{cn|date=February 2020}} According to the Venetian surgeon Nicolo Barbaro \"all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city\". Barbaro described blood flowing in the city \"like rainwater in the gutters after a sudden storm\", and bodies of Turks and Christians floating in the sea \"like melons along a canal\".<ref name=\"Barbaro\" />\n\n===Plundering phase===\nMehmed II granted his soldiers three days to plunder the city, as he had promised them and in accordance with the custom of the time.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|145}}<ref name=\"mCj01\" /> Soldiers fought over the possession of some of the [[War looting|spoils of war]].<ref name=\"histbyzoxon\" />{{rp|283}} Most of the Greek women were raped and enslaved<ref name=\"hRhtW\" />. According to the Venetian surgeon Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, \"all through the day the Turks made a great slaughter of Christians through the city\". According to Philip Mansel, widespread persecution of the city's civilian inhabitants took place, resulting in thousands of murders and rapes and 30,000 civilians being enslaved or forcibly deported.<ref name=\"iK51W\" />\n\nThe looting was extremely thorough in certain parts of the city. Four days later on 2 June, the Sultan would find the city largely deserted and half in ruins; churches had been desecrated and stripped, houses were no longer habitable and stores and shops were emptied. He is famously reported to have been moved to tears by this, speaking \"What a city we have given over to plunder and destruction.\"<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|152}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n<!--Linked from infobox above-->\nOn the third day of the conquest, [[Mehmed II]] ordered all [[looting]] to stop and issued a proclamation that all Christians who had avoided capture or who had been ransomed could return to their homes without further molestation, although many had no homes to return to, and many more had been taken captive and not ransomed.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|150\u201351}} Byzantine historian [[George Sphrantzes]], an eyewitness to the fall of Constantinople, described the Sultan's actions:<ref name=\"ttHMm\" /><ref name=\"vCvPQ\" /><!-- there was a ref to p.&nbsp;133, but it is not clear which edition of which book (Sphrantzes or Kritovoulos) it referred to-->\n\n{{quote | On the third day after the fall of our city, the Sultan celebrated his victory with a great, joyful triumph.

He further declared the restoration of houses and property to those who had abandoned our city before the siege. If they returned home, they would be treated according to their rank and religion, as if nothing had changed. | George Sphrantzes}}\n\nThe ''Hagia Sophia'' was converted into a mosque, but the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople|Greek Orthodox Church]] was allowed to remain intact and [[Gennadius Scholarius]] was appointed [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]]. This was once thought to be the origin of the [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman ''millet'' system]]; however, it is now considered a myth and no such system existed in the fifteenth century.<ref name=\"aMn4U\" /><ref name=\"AIhgF\" />\n\n[[File:Hagia-Sophia-Laengsschnitt.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|Following the city's conquest, the Church of the [[Holy Wisdom]] (the ''[[Hagia Sophia]]'') was converted into a [[mosque]].]]\n\nAfter the sack, many feared other European Christian kingdoms would suffer the same fate as Constantinople. Two possible responses emerged amongst the [[Renaissance humanism|humanists]] and churchmen of that era: [[Crusade]] or dialogue. [[Pope Pius II]] strongly advocated for another Crusade, while the German [[Nicholas of Cusa]] supported engaging in a dialogue with the Ottomans.<ref name=\"NqTxI\" />\n\nThe [[Morea]]n (Peloponnesian) fortress of Mystras, where Constantine's brothers [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrius]] ruled, constantly in conflict with each other and knowing that Mehmed would eventually invade them as well, held out until 1460. Long before the fall of Constantinople, Demetrius had fought for the throne with Thomas, Constantine, and their other brothers [[John VIII Palaiologos|John]] and [[Theodore II Palaiologos, Lord of Morea|Theodore]].<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}} Thomas escaped to Rome when the Ottomans invaded Morea while Demetrius expected to rule a puppet state, but instead was imprisoned and remained there for the rest of his life. In Rome, Thomas and his family received some monetary support from the Pope and other Western rulers as Byzantine emperor in exile, until 1503. In 1461 the independent Byzantine state in [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]] fell to Mehmed.<ref name=\"norwichdeclinefall\" />{{rp|446}}\n\n[[Constantine XI]] had died without producing an heir, and had Constantinople not fallen he likely would have been succeeded by the sons of his deceased elder brother, who were taken into the palace service of Mehmed after the fall of Constantinople. The oldest boy, renamed to Murad, became a personal favourite of Mehmed and served as [[Beylerbey]] (Governor-General) of [[Rumeli]] (the Balkans). The younger son, renamed [[Mesih Pasha]], became Admiral of the Ottoman fleet and Sancak Beg (Governor) of the Province of Gallipoli. He eventually served twice as Grand Vizier under Mehmed's son, [[Bayezid II]].<ref name=\"nsxzN\" />\n\nWith the capture of Constantinople, Mehmed II had acquired the \"natural\" capital of its kingdom, albeit one in decline due to years of war. The loss of the city was a crippling blow to Christendom, and it exposed the Christian west to a vigorous and aggressive foe in the east. The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands. [[Pope Nicholas V]] called for an immediate counter-attack in the form of a crusade.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} When no European monarch was willing to lead the crusade, the Pope himself decided to go, but his early death stopped this plan. As Western Europe entered the 16th century, the [[Crusades|age of Crusading]] began to come to an end.\n\nFor some time Greek scholars had gone to [[Italian city-states]], a cultural exchange begun in 1396 by [[Coluccio Salutati]], chancellor of Florence, who had invited [[Manuel Chrysoloras]], a Byzantine scholar to lecture at the [[University of Florence]].<ref name=\"Mw3eQ\" /> After the conquest many Greeks, such as [[John Argyropoulos]] and [[Constantine Lascaris]], fled the city and found refuge in the Latin West, [[Greek scholars in the Renaissance|bringing with them knowledge and documents from the Greco-Roman tradition to Italy]] and other regions that further propelled the [[Renaissance]].<ref name=\"J2i2B\" /><ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" /> Those Greeks who stayed behind in Constantinople mostly lived in the [[Phanar]] and [[Galata]] districts of the city. The [[Phanariotes]], as they were called, provided many capable advisers to the Ottoman rulers.\n\n===Third Rome===\n{{Main|Third Rome}}\n\n[[File:Gentile Bellini 003.jpg|thumb|''Sultan Mehmed II the Conqueror'', by [[Gentile Bellini]]]]\n\n[[Byzantium]] is a term used by modern historians to refer to the later Roman Empire. In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire. Other potential claimants, such as the [[Republic of Venice]] and the [[Holy Roman Empire]] have disintegrated into history.<ref name=\"W8pk7\" />\n\n===Impact on the Churches===\nIn 17th-century Russia, the fall of Constantinople had a role in the fierce theological and political controversy between adherents and opponents of the [[Raskol|reforms]] in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] carried out by [[Patriarch Nikon]], which he intended to bring the Russian Church closer to the norms and practices of other Orthodox churches. [[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam. As a result of this process, the centre of authority in the Orthodox Church changed and migrated to Eastern Europe (e.g., [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russia]]) rather than remaining in the former Byzantine Near East.{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}}\n\n==Cultural references==\n===Legends===\nThere are many legends in Greece surrounding the Fall of Constantinople. It was said that [[May 1453 lunar eclipse|the partial lunar eclipse]] that occurred on 22 May 1453 represented a fulfilment of a prophecy of the city's demise.<ref name=\"L0Kni\" /> Four days later, the whole city was blotted out by a thick [[fog]], a condition unknown in that part of the world in May. When the fog lifted that evening, a strange light was seen playing about the dome of the Hagia Sophia, which some interpreted as the [[Holy Spirit]] departing from the city. \"This evidently indicated the departure of the Divine Presence, and its leaving the City in total abandonment and desertion, for the Divinity conceals itself in cloud and appears and again disappears.\"<ref name=\"OBWWf\" /> For others, there was still a distant hope that the lights were the campfires of the troops of [[John Hunyadi]] who had come to relieve the city.{{NoteTag|It is possible that all these phenomena were local effects of the cataclysmic [[Kuwae]] volcanic eruption in the Pacific Ocean. The \"fire\" seen may have been an optical illusion due to the reflection of intensely red twilight glow by clouds of volcanic ash high in the atmosphere.<ref name=\"nasakuwae\" />}}\n\nAnother legend holds that two priests saying [[divine liturgy]] over the crowd disappeared into the cathedral's walls as the first Turkish soldiers entered. According to the legend, the priests will appear again on the day that Constantinople returns to Christian hands.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|147}} Another legend refers to the ''Marble King'' (Constantine XI), holding that an angel rescued the emperor when the Ottomans entered the city, turning him into marble and placing him in a cave under the earth near the Golden Gate, where he waits to be brought to life again (a variant of the [[sleeping hero]] legend).<ref name=\"3otvo\" /><ref name=\"hatzfallhec\" />\n\n===Cultural impact===\n[[Guillaume Dufay]] composed several songs lamenting the fall of the Eastern church, and the duke of Burgundy, [[Philip the Good]], [[Feast of the Pheasant|avowed]] to take up arms against the Turks. However, as the growing Ottoman power from this date on coincided with the [[Protestant Reformation]] and subsequent [[Counter-Reformation]], the recapture of Constantinople became an ever-distant dream. Even France, once a fervent participant in the Crusades, became an ally of the Ottomans.\n\nNonetheless, depictions of Christian coalitions taking the city and of the late Emperor's resurrection by [[Leo the Wise]] persisted.<ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" />{{rp|280}}\n\n29 May 1453, the day of the fall of Constantinople, fell on a Tuesday, and since then Tuesday has been considered an unlucky day by Greeks generally.<ref name=\"QMrK6\" />\n\n===Impact on the Renaissance===\n{{Main|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\nThe migration waves of [[Byzantine]] scholars and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking of Constantinople]] and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered by many scholars key to the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies that led to the development of the [[Renaissance humanism]]<ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" />{{dead link|date=November 2016}}{{better source|reason=Tall claim requires high-quality academic citation, not a website|date=November 2016}} and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]].

''Islambol'' ({{lang|ota| \u0627\u0633\u0644\u0627\u0645\u0628\u0648\u0644}}, ''Full of Islam'') or ''Islambul'' (''find Islam'') or ''Islam(b)ol'' (''old [[Turkic languages|Turkic]]: be Islam''), both in Turkish Language, were [[folk etymology|folk-etymological]] adaptations of ''Istanbul'' created after the Ottoman conquest of 1453 to express the city's new role as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire. It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan [[Mehmed II]] himself.<ref name=\"istanbulunadlari\" />\n\nThe [[Names of Istanbul|name of Istanbul]] is thought to be derived from the Greek phrase ''\u012bs t\u012bmbol\u012b(n)'' ({{lang-el|\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''eis t\u0113n p\u00f3lin'', \"to the City\"), and it is claimed that it had already spread among the Turkish populace of the Ottoman Empire before the conquest.

{{lang-tr|{{italics correction|\u0130stanbul'un Fethi}}|lit= '''Conquest of Istanbul'''}}) was the capture of the [[capital city]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] by an invading [[Ottoman army]] on 29 May 1453. The attackers were commanded by the 21-year-old [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Mehmed II]], who defeated an army commanded by [[Byzantine Emperor|Emperor]] [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] and took control of the imperial capital, ending a 53-day siege that had begun on 6 April 1453. After conquering the city, Sultan Mehmed transferred the capital of the Ottoman State from [[Edirne|Adrianople]] to Constantinople and established his court there.\n\nThe capture of the city (and two other Byzantine splinter territories soon thereafter) marked the end of the [[Roman Empire]], a state which dated to 27 BC, which had lasted for nearly 1,500 years.<ref name=\"ms97\" /> The conquest of Constantinople also dealt a massive blow to the defence of mainland Europe, as the Muslim Ottoman armies thereafter were left unchecked to advance into Europe without an adversary to their rear.\n\nIt was also a watershed moment in military history. Since ancient times, cities had used ramparts and city walls to protect themselves from invaders, and Constantinople's substantial fortifications had been a model followed by cities throughout the Mediterranean region and Europe. The Ottomans ultimately prevailed due to the use of [[gunpowder]] (which powered formidable cannons).<ref name=\"econfallmill\" />\n\nThe conquest of the city of Constantinople and the end of the Byzantine Empire<ref name=\"ealoipolis\" /> was a key event in the [[Late Middle Ages]] which also marks, for some historians, the end of the Medieval period.<ref name=\"GpAG8\" />\n\n==State of the Byzantine Empire==\n[[Constantinople]] had been an imperial capital since its consecration in 330 under Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]]. In the following eleven centuries, the city had been [[List of sieges of Constantinople|besieged many times]] but was captured only once: during the [[Fourth Crusade]] in 1204.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|304}} The crusaders established an unstable [[Latin Empire|Latin state]] in and around Constantinople while the remaining empire splintered into a number of Byzantine successor states, notably [[Empire of Nicaea|Nicaea]], [[Despotate of Epirus|Epirus]] and [[Empire of Trebizond|Trebizond]]. They fought as allies against the Latin establishments, but also fought among themselves for the Byzantine throne.\n\nThe Nicaeans eventually reconquered Constantinople from the Latins in 1261, reestablishing the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologos dynasty. Thereafter, there was little peace for the much-weakened empire as it fended off successive attacks by the Latins, the [[Serbia]]ns, the [[Bulgaria]]ns, and, most importantly, the [[Ottoman Turks]].<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" /><ref name=\"O2kxx\" /><ref name=\"ospbyzwar6001453\" /><ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" /> The [[Black Plague]] between 1346 and 1349 killed almost half of the inhabitants of Constantinople.<ref name=\"rCeS6\" /> The city was further depopulated by the general economic and territorial decline of the empire, and by 1453 consisted of a series of walled villages separated by vast fields encircled by the fifth-century [[Theodosian Walls]].\n\nBy 1450 the empire was exhausted and had shrunk to a few square kilometres outside the city of Constantinople itself, the [[Princes' Islands]] in the [[Sea of Marmara]], and the [[Peloponnese]] with its cultural centre at [[Mystras]]. The [[Empire of Trebizond]], an independent [[successor state]] that formed in the aftermath of the Fourth Crusade, also survived on the coast of the [[Black Sea]].\n\n==Preparations==\nWhen Sultan [[Mehmed II]] succeeded his father in 1451, he was just nineteen years old.  Many European courts assumed that the young Ottoman ruler would not seriously challenge Christian hegemony in the [[Balkans]] and the Aegean.<ref name=\"nbpyu\" /> This calculation was boosted by Mehmed's friendly overtures to the European envoys at his new court.<ref name=\"cJRwI\" /> But Mehmed's mild words were not matched by actions. By early 1452, work began on the construction of a second [[fortress]] (''[[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumeli hisar\u0131]]'') on the [[Bosphorus]],<ref name=\"WDL\" /> on the European side several miles north of Constantinople, set directly across the strait on the Asian side from the ''[[Anadoluhisar\u0131|Anadolu Hisar\u0131]]'' fortress, built by his great-grandfather [[Bayezid I]]. This pair of fortresses ensured complete control of sea traffic on the Bosphorus;<ref name=\"MBVR8\" /> and defended against attack by the [[Genoa|Genoese]] colonies on the Black Sea coast to the north. (This new fortress, was called  ''Bo\u011fazkesen'', which means 'strait-blocker' or 'throat-cutter', to emphasize its strategic position.) In October 1452, Mehmed ordered [[Turakhan Beg]] to station a large garrison force in the [[Peloponnese]] to block [[Thomas Palaiologos|Thomas]] and [[Demetrios Palaiologos|Demetrios]] ([[despotes]] in Southern Greece) from providing aid to their brother [[Constantine XI Palaiologos]] during the impending siege of Constantinople.{{NoteTag|While Mehmed II had been steadily preparing for the siege of Constantinople, he had sent the old general Turakhan and the latter's two sons, Ahmed Beg and Omar Beg, to invade the [[Morea]] and to remain there all winter also to prevent the despots Thomas and Demetrius from giving aid to Constantine XI.<ref name=\"setpapacylevant\" />{{rp|146}}}}  [[Michael Critobulus]] quotes the speech of Mehmed II to his soldiers: \"My friends and men of my empire! You all know very well that our forefathers secured this kingdom that we now hold at the cost of many struggles and very great dangers and that, having passed it along in succession from their fathers, from father to son, they handed it down to me. For some of the oldest of you were sharers in many of the exploits carried through by them\u2014those at least of you who are of maturer years\u2014and the younger of you have heard of these deeds from your fathers. They are not such very ancient events nor of such a sort as to be forgotten through the lapse of time. Still, the eyewitness of those who have seen testifies better than does the hearing of deeds that happened but yesterday or the day before.\"\n\n===European support===\n[[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine Emperor]] [[Constantine XI]] swiftly understood Mehmed's true intentions and turned to [[Western Europe]] for help; but now the price of centuries of war and enmity between the [[Eastern Christianity|eastern]] and [[Western Christianity|western churches]] had to be paid. Since the [[East\u2013West Schism|mutual excommunications]] of 1054, the [[pope]] in Rome was committed to establishing authority over [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the eastern church]]. The Union was agreed by the Byzantine Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] in 1274, at the [[Second Council of Lyon]], and indeed, some Palaiologoi emperors (Latin, Palaeologan) had since been received into the [[Latin Church]]. Emperor [[John VIII Palaiologos]] had also recently negotiated union with [[Pope Eugene IV]], with the [[Council of Florence#Eugene IV's eastern strategy|Council of Florence]] of 1439 proclaiming a ''Bull of Union''. The imperial efforts to impose union were met with strong resistance in Constantinople. A propaganda initiative was stimulated by anti-unionist [[Greek Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] partisans in Constantinople; the population, as well as the laity and leadership of the Byzantine Church, became bitterly divided. Latent [[ethnic hatred]] between Greeks and Italians, stemming from the events of the [[Massacre of the Latins]] in 1182 by the Greeks and the [[Fourth Crusade|sack of Constantinople]] in 1204 by the Latins, played a significant role. Ultimately, the attempted Union failed, greatly annoying [[Pope Nicholas V]] and the hierarchy of the Roman church.\n\n[[File:Eastern Mediterranean 1450 .svg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The Byzantine Empire in the first half of the 15th&nbsp;century. Thessaloniki was captured by the Ottomans in 1430. A few islands in the Aegean and the [[Propontis]] remained under Byzantine rule until 1453 (not shown on the map).]]\n\nIn the summer of 1452, when [[Rumelihisar\u0131|Rumel\u0131 Hisari]] was completed and the threat had become imminent, Constantine wrote to the Pope, promising to implement the Union, which was declared valid by a half-hearted imperial court on 12 December 1452.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}} Although he was eager for an advantage, Pope Nicholas V did not have the influence the Byzantines thought he had over the Western kings and princes, some of whom were wary of increasing papal control, and these had not the wherewithal to contribute to the effort, especially in light of the weakened state of France and England from the [[Hundred Years' War]], Spain, being in the final part of the [[Reconquista]], the internecine fighting in the [[Holy Roman Empire]], and Hungary and Poland's defeat at the [[Battle of Varna]] of 1444. Although some troops did arrive from the mercantile city-states in the north of Italy, the Western contribution was not adequate to counterbalance Ottoman strength. Some Western individuals, however, came to help defend the city on their own account. Cardinal Isidore, funded by the pope, arrived in 1452 with 200 archers.<ref name=\"qGd6u\" /> An accomplished soldier from [[Genoa]], [[Giovanni Giustiniani]],  arrived with 400 men from Genoa and 300 men from Genoese Chios, in January 1453.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|83\u201384}} As a specialist in defending walled cities, he was immediately given the overall command of the defence of the land walls by the emperor. Around the same time, the captains of the Venetian ships that happened to be present in the [[Golden Horn]] offered their services to the Emperor, barring contrary orders from [[Venice]], and Pope Nicholas undertook to send three ships laden with provisions, which set sail near the end of March.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|81}}\n\nIn Venice, meanwhile, deliberations were taking place concerning the kind of assistance the Republic would lend to Constantinople. The Senate decided upon sending a fleet in February 1453, but there were delays, and when it finally set out late in April, it was already too late for it to be able to take part in the battle.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}} Further undermining Byzantine morale, seven Italian ships with around 700 men slipped out of the capital at the moment when Giustiniani arrived, men who had sworn to defend the capital. At the same time, Constantine's attempts to appease the Sultan with gifts ended with the execution of the Emperor's ambassadors\u2014even Byzantine diplomacy could not save the city.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|373}}<ref name=\"ThackerayFindling2012\" /><ref name=\"Norwich1998\" /><ref name=\"Somerwil-Ayrton2007\" /><ref name=\"Roberts1973\" /><ref name=\"Brownworth2009\" /><ref name=\"Norwich v.3\" />\n\n[[File:Walls of Constantinople.JPG|right|thumb|upright=1|Restored Walls of Constantinople]]\n[[File:Hali\u00e7 zinciri (2).jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The [[boom (navigational barrier)|chain]] that closed off the entrance to the Golden Horn in 1453, now on display in the [[\u0130stanbul Archaeology Museums]].]]\n\nFearing a possible naval attack along the shores of the Golden Horn, Emperor Constantine XI ordered that a [[boom (navigational barrier)|defensive chain]] be placed at the mouth of the harbour. This chain, which floated on logs, was strong enough to prevent any Turkish ship from entering the harbour. This device was one of two that gave the Byzantines some hope of extending the siege until the possible arrival of foreign help.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{rp|380}} This strategy was enforced because in 1204 the armies of the Fourth Crusade successfully circumvented Constantinople's land defences by breaching the Golden Horn Wall. Another strategy employed by the Byzantines was the repair and fortification of the Land Wall (Theodosian Walls). Emperor Constantine deemed it necessary to ensure that the [[Blachernae]] district's wall was the most fortified because that section of the wall protruded northwards. The land fortifications comprised a {{convert|60|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide moat fronting inner and outer [[Battlement|crenellated walls]] studded with towers every 45\u201355 metres.<ref name=\"f6GY9\" />\n\n===Strength===\n[[File:Siege of Constantinople 1453 map-fr.svg|thumb|left|Map of Constantinople and the dispositions of the defenders and the besiegers]]\n\nThe army defending Constantinople was relatively small, totalling about 7,000 men, 2,000 of whom were foreigners.{{NoteTag|According to Sphrantzes, whom Constantine had ordered to make a census, the Emperor was appalled when the number of native men capable of bearing arms turned out to be only 4,983. Leonardo di Chio gave a number of 6,000 Greeks.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}}}} At the onset of the siege, probably fewer than 50,000 people were living within the walls, including the refugees from the surrounding area.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|32}} {{NoteTag|The Spanish [[Crist\u00f3bal de Villal\u00f3n]] claims there were ' 60,000 Turkish households, 40,000 Greek and Armenian, 10,000 Jewish.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|85}}}} Turkish commander Dorgano, who was in Constantinople in the pay of the Emperor, was also guarding one of the quarters of the city on the seaward side with the Turks in his pay. These Turks kept loyal to the Emperor and perished in the ensuing battle. The defending army's Genoese corps were well trained and equipped, while the rest of the army consisted of small numbers of well-trained soldiers, armed civilians, sailors and volunteer forces from foreign communities, and finally [[monks]]. The garrison used a few small-calibre artillery pieces, which nonetheless proved ineffective. The rest of the citizens repaired walls, stood guard on observation posts, collected and distributed food provisions, and collected gold and silver objects from churches to melt down into coins to pay the foreign soldiers.\n\nThe Ottomans had a much larger force. Recent studies and Ottoman archival data state that there were about 50,000\u201380,000 Ottoman soldiers including between 5,000 and 10,000 [[Janissary|Janissaries]],<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}, 70 [[cannon]]s<ref name=\"battle100\" />{{rp|139\u2013140}}<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"halilosmanimpklas\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}, an elite infantry corps, and thousands of Christian troops, notably 1,500 Serbian cavalry{{cn|date=February 2020}} that the [[Serbs|Serbian]] lord [[\u0110ura\u0111 Brankovi\u0107]] was forced to supply as part of his obligation to the Ottoman sultan\u2014just a few months before, he had supplied the money for the reconstruction of the walls of Constantinople.

They were built at [[foundries]] that employed Turkish cannon founders and technicians, most notably Saruca, in addition to at least one foreign cannon founder, [[Orban]] (also called Urban). Most of the cannons at the siege were built by Turkish engineers, including a large bombard by Saruca, while one cannon was built by Orban, who contributed a large bombard.<ref name=\"Steele\" /><ref name=\"Hammer\" />\n\nOrban, a Hungarian (though some suggest he was German), was a somewhat mysterious figure.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|374}} His cannon was named \"[[Basilic (cannon)|Basilica]]\" and was {{convert|27|ft|m}} long, and able to hurl a 600&nbsp;lb (272&nbsp;kg) stone ball over a mile (1.6&nbsp;km).<ref name=\"q6rsq\" /> The founder initially tried to sell his services to the Byzantines, who were unable to secure the funds needed to hire him. Orban then left Constantinople and approached Mehmed II, claiming that his weapon could blast 'the walls of [[Babylon]] itself'.

His army encamped outside the city on the Monday after [[Easter]], 2 April 1453.\n\nThe bulk of the Ottoman army were encamped south of the Golden Horn. The regular European troops, stretched out along the entire length of the walls, were commanded by Karadja Pasha. The regular troops from [[Anatolia]] under Ishak Pasha were stationed south of the Lycus down to the Sea of Marmara. Mehmed himself erected his red-and-gold tent near the ''Mesoteichion'', where the guns and the elite regiments, the Janissaries, were positioned. The [[Bashi-bazouk]]s were spread out behind the front lines. Other troops under [[Zagan Pasha]] were employed north of the Golden Horn.

The walls had recently been repaired (under [[John VIII Palaiologos|John VIII]]) and were in fairly good shape, giving the defenders sufficient reason to believe that they could hold out until help from the West arrived.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|39}} In addition, the defenders were relatively well-equipped with a fleet of 26 ships: 5 from [[Genoa]], 5 from [[Venice]], 3 from Venetian [[Crete]], 1 from [[Ancona]], 1 from [[Aragon]], 1 from France, and about 10 Byzantine.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|45}}\n\nOn 5 April, the Sultan himself arrived with his last troops, and the defenders took up their positions. As their numbers were insufficient to occupy the walls in their entirety, it had been decided that only the outer walls would be manned. Constantine and his Greek troops guarded the ''Mesoteichion'', the middle section of the land walls, where they were crossed by the river Lycus. This section was considered the weakest spot in the walls and an attack was feared here most. Giustiniani was stationed to the north of the emperor, at the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of Charisius|Charisian Gate]] (''Myriandrion''); later during the siege, he was shifted to the ''Mesoteichion'' to join Constantine, leaving the ''Myriandrion'' to the charge of the Bocchiardi brothers. Minotto and his Venetians were stationed in the Blachernae palace, together with Teodoro Caristo, the Langasco brothers, and Archbishop Leonardo of Chios.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nTo the left of the emperor, further south, were the commanders Cataneo, with Genoese troops, and Theophilus Palaeologus, who guarded the [[Walls of Constantinople#Gate of the Spring|Pegae Gate]] with Greek soldiers. The section of the land walls from the Pegae Gate to the Golden Gate (itself guarded by a Genoese called Manuel) was defended by the Venetian Filippo Contarini, while Demetrius Cantacuzenus had taken position on the southernmost part of the Theodosian wall.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|92}}\n\nThe sea walls were manned more sparsely, with Jacobo Contarini at [[Stoudion]], a makeshift defence force of Greek monks to his left hand, and prince Orhan at the Harbour of Eleutherius. Pere Juli\u00e0 was stationed at the Great Palace with Genoese and Catalan troops; Cardinal Isidore of Kiev guarded the tip of the peninsula near the boom. The sea walls at the southern shore of the [[Golden Horn]] were defended by Venetian and Genoese sailors under [[Gabriele Trevisano]].<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nTwo tactical reserves were kept behind in the city, one in the Petra district just behind the land walls and one near the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]], under the command of [[Loukas Notaras]] and Nicephorus Palaeologus, respectively. The Venetian Alviso Diedo commanded the ships in the harbour.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|94}}\n\nAlthough the Byzantines also had cannons, they were much smaller than those of the Ottomans and the [[recoil]] tended to damage their own walls.<ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" />\n\nAccording to [[David Nicolle]], despite many odds, the idea that Constantinople was inevitably doomed is wrong, and the overall situation was not as one-sided as a simple glance at a map might suggest.<ref name=\"nicolleendbyz\" />{{rp|40}} It has also been claimed that Constantinople was \"the best-defended city in Europe\" at that time.<ref name=\"bZgqW\" />\n\n==Siege==\nAt the beginning of the siege, Mehmed sent out some of his best troops to reduce the remaining Byzantine strongholds outside the city of Constantinople. The fortress of Therapia on the Bosphorus and a smaller castle at the village of Studius near the Sea of Marmara were taken within a few days. The [[Princes' Islands]] in the Sea of Marmara were taken by [[Suleiman Baltoghlu|Admiral Baltoghlu]]'s fleet.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|96\u201397}} Mehmed's massive cannon fired on the walls for weeks, but due to its imprecision and extremely slow rate of reloading the Byzantines were able to repair most of the damage after each shot, limiting the cannon's effect.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}}\n\n[[File:Kusatma Zonaro.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The Ottoman Turks transport their fleet overland into the [[Golden Horn]].]]\n\nMeanwhile, despite some probing attacks, the Ottoman fleet under [[Suleiman Baltoghlu]] could not enter the Golden Horn due to the chain the Byzantines had previously stretched across the entrance. Although one of the fleet's main tasks was to prevent any ships from outside from entering the Golden Horn, on 20 April a small flotilla of four Christian ships{{NoteTag|These were the three Genoese ships sent by the Pope, joined by a large Imperial transport ship which had been sent on a foraging mission to Sicily previous to the siege and was on its way back to Constantinople.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|100}}}} managed to slip in after some heavy fighting, an event which strengthened the morale of the defenders and caused embarrassment to the Sultan.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} Baltoghlu's life was spared after his subordinates testified to his bravery during the conflict.\n\nMehmed ordered the construction of a road of greased logs across [[Galata]] on the north side of the Golden Horn, and dragged his ships over the hill, directly into the Golden Horn on 22 April, bypassing the chain barrier.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|376}} This seriously threatened the flow of supplies from Genoese ships from the\u2014nominally neutral\u2014colony of [[Beyo\u011flu|Pera]], and demoralized the Byzantine defenders. On the night of 28 April, an attempt was made to destroy the Ottoman ships already in the Golden Horn using [[fire ship]]s, but the Ottomans forced the Christians to retreat with heavy losses. Forty Italians escaped their sinking ships and swam to the northern shore.  On orders of Mehmed, they were [[Impalement|impaled]] on stakes, in sight of the city's defenders on the sea walls across the Golden Horn. In retaliation, the defenders brought their Ottoman prisoners, 260 in all, to the walls, where they were executed, one by one, before the eyes of the Ottomans.<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|108}}<ref name=\"MoRBA\" /> With the failure of their attack on the Ottoman vessels, the defenders were forced to disperse part of their forces to defend the sea walls along the Golden Horn.\n\nThe Ottoman army had made several frontal assaults on the land wall of Constantinople, but were always repelled with heavy losses.<ref name=\"FdrIR\" /> Venetian surgeon [[Niccol\u00f2 Barbaro]], describing in his diary one of such frequent land attacks especially by the Janissaries, wrote:\n\n{{quote|They found the Turks coming right up under the walls and seeking battle, particularly the Janissaries&nbsp;... and when one or two of them were killed, at once more Turks came and took away the dead ones&nbsp;... without caring how near they came to the city walls. Our men shot at them with guns and crossbows, aiming at the Turk who was carrying away his dead countryman, and both of them would fall to the ground dead, and then there came other Turks and took them away, none fearing death, but being willing to let ten of themselves be killed rather than suffer the shame of leaving a single Turkish corpse by the walls.<ref name=\"Barbaro\" />}}\n\n[[File:Siege constantinople bnf fr2691.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Siege of Constantinople as depicted between 1453 and 1475.<ref name=\"JRaLV\" />]]\n\nAfter these inconclusive frontal offensives, the Ottomans sought to break through the walls by constructing tunnels in an effort to [[mining (military)|mine]] them from mid-May to 25 May. Many of the sappers were miners of Serbian origin sent from [[Novo Brdo]] by the Serbian [[Despot (court title)|despot]]. They were placed under the command of [[Zagan Pasha]]. However, an engineer named [[Johannes Grant]], a German{{NoteTag|[[Steven Runciman|Runciman]] speculates that he may have been Scottish<ref name=\"runcimanfall\" />{{rp|84}}}} who came together with the Genoese contingent, had counter-mines dug, allowing Byzantine troops to enter the mines and kill the workers. The Byzantines intercepted the first Serbian tunnel on the night of 16 May. Subsequent tunnels were interrupted on 21, 23, and 25 May, and destroyed with [[Greek fire]] and vigorous combat. On 23 May, the Byzantines captured and [[torture]]d two Turkish officers, who revealed the location of all the Turkish tunnels, which were then destroyed.<ref name=\"TQ2Lp\" />\n\nOn 21 May, Mehmed sent an ambassador to Constantinople and offered to lift the siege if they gave him the city. He promised he would allow the Emperor and any other inhabitants to leave with their possessions. Moreover, he would recognize the Emperor as governor of the Peloponnese. Lastly, he guaranteed the safety of the population that might choose to remain in the city. Constantine XI only agreed to pay higher tributes to the sultan and recognized the status of all the conquered castles and lands in the hands of the Turks as Ottoman possession.\n\n{{quote|As to surrendering the city to you, it is not for me to decide or for anyone else of its citizens; for all of us have reached the mutual decision to die of our own free will, without any regard for our lives.{{NoteTag|Original text: \u03a4\u1f78 \u03b4\u1f72 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd \u03c3\u03bf\u1fd6 \u03b4\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bd\u03b1\u03b9 \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f10\u03bc\u1f78\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af\u03bd \u03bf\u1f54\u03c4' \u1f04\u03bb\u03bb\u03bf\u03c5 \u03c4\u1ff6\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u03c4\u03bf\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03cd\u03bd\u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03b1\u03cd\u03c4\u1fc3\u2022 \u03ba\u03bf\u03b9\u03bd\u1fc7 \u03b3\u1f70\u03c1 \u03b3\u03bd\u03ce\u03bc\u1fc3 \u03c0\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03c4\u03bf\u03c0\u03c1\u03bf\u03b1\u03b9\u03c1\u03ad\u03c4\u03c9\u03c2 \u1f00\u03c0\u03bf\u03b8\u03b1\u03bd\u03bf\u1fe6\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bf\u1f50 \u03c6\u03b5\u03b9\u03c3\u03cc\u03bc\u03b5\u03b8\u03b1 \u03c4\u1fc6\u03c2 \u03b6\u03c9\u1fc6\u03c2 \u1f21\u03bc\u1ff6\u03bd.<ref name=\"29maiouiefemerida\" />}}}}\n\nAround this time, Mehmed had a final council with his senior officers. Here he encountered some resistance; one of his Viziers, the veteran [[\u00c7andarl\u0131 Halil Pasha|Halil Pasha]], who had always disapproved of Mehmed's plans to conquer the city, now admonished him to abandon the siege in the face of recent adversity. [[Zagan Pasha]] argued against Halil Pasha, and insisted on an immediate attack. Mehmed planned to overpower the walls by sheer force, expecting that the weakened Byzantine defence by the prolonged siege would now be worn out before he ran out of troops and started preparations for a final all-out offensive.\n\n===Final assault===\n[[File:Theofilos Palaiologos.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Painting by the Greek folk painter [[Theophilos Hatzimihail]] showing the battle inside the city, Constantine is visible on a white horse]]\n\nPreparations for the final assault were started in the evening of 26 May and continued to the next day.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} For 36 hours after the war council decision to attack, the Ottomans extensively mobilized their manpower in order to prepare for the general offensive.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|378}} Prayer and resting would be then granted to the soldiers on the 28th, and then the final assault would be launched. On the Byzantine side, a small Venetian fleet of 12 ships, after having searched the Aegean, reached the Capital on May 27 and reported to the Emperor that no large Venetian relief fleet was on its way.<ref name=\"norwichshortbyzhist\" />{{rp|377}} On May 28, as the Ottoman army prepared for the final assault, large-scale religious processions were held in the city.

The Christian troops of the Ottoman Empire attacked first, followed by the successive waves of the irregular [[azap]]s, who were poorly trained and equipped, and [[Anatolia]]ns who focused on a section of the [[Blachernae]] walls in the north-west part of the city, which had been damaged by the cannon. This section of the walls had been built earlier, in the eleventh century, and was much weaker. The [[Anatolians]] managed to breach this section of walls and entered the city but were just as quickly pushed back by the defenders. Finally, as the battle was continuing, the last wave, consisting of elite Janissaries, attacked the city walls. The Genoese general in charge of the land troops,<ref name=\"pertusicadvol1\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}<ref name=\"isbesepistle\" /><ref name=\"LeonardoChio\" /> [[Giovanni Giustiniani]], was grievously wounded during the attack, and his evacuation from the ramparts caused a panic in the ranks of the defenders.{{NoteTag|Sources hostile towards the Genoese (such as the Venetian Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro), however, report that Longo was only lightly wounded or not wounded at all, but, overwhelmed by fear, simulated the wound to abandon the battlefield, determining the fall of the city.

The defenders were also being overwhelmed at several points in Constantine's section. When Turkish flags were seen flying above a small postern gate, the Kerkoporta, which was left open, panic ensued, and the defence collapsed, as Janissary soldiers, led by [[Ulubatl\u0131 Hasan]] pressed forward. Many Greek soldiers ran back home to protect their families, the Venetians ran over to their ships, and a few of the Genoese got over to Galata. The rest committed suicide by jumping off the city walls or surrendered.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}} The Greek houses nearest to the walls were the first to suffer from the Ottomans. It is said that Constantine, throwing aside his purple regalia, led the final charge against the incoming Ottomans, perishing in the ensuing battle in the streets just like his soldiers. On the other hand, Nicol\u00f2 Barbaro, a Venetian eyewitness to the siege, wrote in his diary that it was said that Constantine hanged himself at the moment when the Turks broke in at the San Romano gate, although his ultimate fate remains unknown.{{NoteTag|Barbaro added the description of the emperor's heroic last moments to his diary based on information he received afterward.

Mehmed II had sent an advance guard to protect key buildings such as the [[Church of the Holy Apostles]].\n\nA small few lucky civilians managed to escape. When the Venetians retreated over to their ships, the Ottomans had already taken the walls of the Golden Horn. Luckily for the occupants of the city, the Ottomans were not interested in killing potentially valuable slaves, but rather in the loot they could get from raiding the city's houses, so they decided to attack the city instead. The Venetian captain ordered his men to break open the gate of the Golden Horn. Having done so, the Venetians left in ships filled with soldiers and refugees. Shortly after the Venetians left, a few Genoese ships and even the Emperor's ships followed them out of the Golden Horn. This fleet narrowly escaped prior to the Ottoman navy assuming control over the Golden Horn, which was accomplished by midday.<ref name=\"nicollastcenbyz\" />{{page needed|date=June 2017}}\nThe Army converged upon the [[Augusteum]], the vast square that fronted the great church of Hagia Sophia whose bronze gates were barred by a huge throng of civilians inside the building, hoping for divine protection.

The Christian re-conquest of Constantinople remained a goal in Western Europe for many years after its fall to the [[House of Osman]].  Rumours of Constantine XI's survival and subsequent rescue by an angel led many to hope that the city would one day return to Christian hands.

In its own time, the Empire ruled from Constantinople (or \"New Rome\" as some people call it, although this was a laudatory expression that was never an official title) was considered simply as \"the Roman Empire.\" The fall of Constantinople led competing factions to lay claim to being the inheritors of the Imperial mantle. Russian claims to Byzantine heritage clashed with those of the Ottoman Empire's own claim. In Mehmed's view, he was the successor to the [[Roman Emperor]], declaring himself ''Kayser-i Rum'', literally \"[[Caesar (title)|Caesar of Rome]]\", that is, of the Roman Empire, though he was remembered as \"the Conqueror\".  He founded a political system that survived until 1922 with the establishment of the [[Republic of Turkey]].\n\n[[Stefan Du\u0161an]], Tsar of [[Serbian Empire|Serbia]], and [[Ivan Alexander]], Tsar of [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgaria]], both made similar claims, regarding themselves as legitimate heirs to the Roman Empire.

[[Avvakum]] and other \"[[Old Believers]]\" saw these reforms as a [[corruption (philosophical concept)|corruption]] of the Russian Church, which they considered to be the \"true\" Church of God. As the other Churches were more closely related to Constantinople in their liturgies, Avvakum argued that Constantinople fell to the Turks because of these [[heresy|heretical]] beliefs and practices.\n\nThe fall of Constantinople has a profound impact on the ancient [[Pentarchy]] of [[Eastern Orthodox Church|the Orthodox Church]]. Today, the four ancient sees of Jerusalem, Antioch, Alexandria, and Constantinople are almost completely devoid of followers and believers{{Citation needed|date=January 2020}} because of Islamization and the ''[[Dhimma]]'' system to which Christians have been subjected since the earliest days of Islam.

Even France, once a fervent participant in the Crusades, became an ally of the Ottomans.\n\nNonetheless, depictions of Christian coalitions taking the city and of the late Emperor's resurrection by [[Leo the Wise]] persisted.<ref name=\"oxhistbyzmango\" />{{rp|280}}\n\n29 May 1453, the day of the fall of Constantinople, fell on a Tuesday, and since then Tuesday has been considered an unlucky day by Greeks generally.<ref name=\"QMrK6\" />\n\n===Impact on the Renaissance===\n{{Main|Greek scholars in the Renaissance}}\nThe migration waves of [[Byzantine]] scholars and \u00e9migr\u00e9s in the period following the [[Siege of Constantinople|sacking of Constantinople]] and the fall of Constantinople in 1453 is considered by many scholars key to the revival of [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[ancient Rome|Roman]] studies that led to the development of the [[Renaissance humanism]]<ref name=\"Byzantines in Renaissance Italy\" />{{dead link|date=November 2016}}{{better source|reason=Tall claim requires high-quality academic citation, not a website|date=November 2016}} and [[History of science in the Renaissance|science]].

It is first attested shortly after the conquest, and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan [[Mehmed II]] himself.<ref name=\"istanbulunadlari\" />\n\nThe [[Names of Istanbul|name of Istanbul]] is thought to be derived from the Greek phrase ''\u012bs t\u012bmbol\u012b(n)'' ({{lang-el|\u03b5\u1f30\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f74\u03bd \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03bd}}, [[transliteration|translit.]] ''eis t\u0113n p\u00f3lin'', \"to the City\"), and it is claimed that it had already spread among the Turkish populace of the Ottoman Empire before the conquest.

First appearing in the show's [[Doctor Who (series 7)|seventh series]], Clara served as a companion of the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[time travel in fiction|time traveller]] known as [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in his [[Eleventh Doctor|eleventh]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) and [[Twelfth Doctor|twelfth]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) incarnations. She remains the longest serving companion since the show's revival in 2005.\n\nClara is initially presented to the audience during the seventh series as three distinct, though similarly named, people living in different eras. The first two incarnations, Oswin Oswald and Clara Oswin Oswald, each die during the episode in which they appear. The third incarnation becomes the Doctor's companion, travelling with him for the remainder of the series as he tries to uncover the mystery of her multiple lives. She continues to travel with the Doctor after the mystery is resolved at the end of the series, witnessing him regenerate into his twelfth incarnation in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\" (2013). The pair have various adventures together in the [[Doctor Who (series 8)|eighth]] and [[Doctor Who (series 9)|ninth series]] until she departs the show in \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\" (2015). She reappears briefly in the Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon A Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" (2017).\n\nColeman's performance as Clara was well received by critics, however many of the ''Doctor Who fanbase'' have found the character very divisive.\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nOswin Oswald is introduced in the [[Doctor Who (series 7)|series 7]] premiere, \"[[Asylum of the Daleks]]\" (2012). She is the sole survivor of the [[starship]] ''Alaska'', which crashed on the Asylum, a prison planet for insane [[Dalek]]s.

First appearing in the show's [[Doctor Who (series 7)|seventh series]], Clara served as a companion of the [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] [[time travel in fiction|time traveller]] known as [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in his [[Eleventh Doctor|eleventh]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) and [[Twelfth Doctor|twelfth]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]) incarnations. She remains the longest serving companion since the show's revival in 2005.\n\nClara is initially presented to the audience during the seventh series as three distinct, though similarly named, people living in different eras. The first two incarnations, Oswin Oswald and Clara Oswin Oswald, each die during the episode in which they appear. The third incarnation becomes the Doctor's companion, travelling with him for the remainder of the series as he tries to uncover the mystery of her multiple lives. She continues to travel with the Doctor after the mystery is resolved at the end of the series, witnessing him regenerate into his twelfth incarnation in \"[[The Time of the Doctor]]\" (2013). The pair have various adventures together in the [[Doctor Who (series 8)|eighth]] and [[Doctor Who (series 9)|ninth series]] until she departs the show in \"[[Hell Bent (Doctor Who)|Hell Bent]]\" (2015). She reappears briefly in the Christmas special \"[[Twice Upon A Time (Doctor Who)|Twice Upon a Time]]\" (2017).\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===Television===\nOswin Oswald is introduced in the [[Doctor Who (series 7)|series 7]] premiere, \"[[Asylum of the Daleks]]\" (2012). She is the sole survivor of the [[starship]] ''Alaska'', which crashed on the Asylum, a prison planet for insane [[Dalek]]s. Oswin then learns from the [[Eleventh Doctor]] (Matt Smith) that she has been converted from human into a Dalek and has coped by retreating into a fantasy of her own intact survival. She assists the Doctor and his [[Companion (Doctor Who)|travelling companions]], [[Amy Pond]] ([[Karen Gillan]]) and [[Rory Williams]] ([[Arthur Darvill]]), to escape the planet unharmed, but at the cost of her own life.<ref>{{Cite episode |title=Asylum of the Daleks |episode-link=Asylum of the Daleks |url= |access-date= |series=Doctor Who |series-link=Doctor Who |first=Steven (writer) |last=Moffat |author-link=Steven Moffat |first2=Nick (director) |last2=Hurran |author-link2=Nick Hurran |first3=Marcus (producer) |last3=Wilson |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |date=1 September 2012 |season= |series-no=7 |number=1 |minutes= |time= |transcript= |transcript-url= |quote= |language=}}</ref> Later, in the 2012 Christmas special \"[[The Snowmen]]\", the Doctor meets a woman named Clara Oswin Oswald, whom he initially knows only as Clara.

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-thru\" testing stations for quick testing.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-thru\" testing stations for quick testing. Diagnostics company Seegene Inc. is also exporting its test kits to other countries including China, Europe and the US.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/south-korea-tests-hundreds-of-thousands-to-fight-virus-outbreak Virus Testing Blitz Appears to Keep Korea Death Rate Low] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309094739/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/south-korea-tests-hundreds-of-thousands-to-fight-virus-outbreak |date=9 March 2020 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seegene-launches-kfda-approved-covid-19-assay-301005858.html Seegene launches KFDA Approved COVID-19 Assay]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219191708/https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seegene-launches-kfda-approved-covid-19-assay-301005858.html |date=19 February 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] attributed the factors behind the low death rate of South Korea to the rigorous testing and the infected population profile. South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women.
