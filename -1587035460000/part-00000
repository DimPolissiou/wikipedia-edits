Moncrieff developed two alternative 'models' for understanding what drugs might be doing when they are prescribed to people with mental health problems. The current mainstream understanding of psychiatric drug action is based on a 'disease-centred' model that suggests that drugs work by rectifying the underlying abnormality that is presumed to lead to the symptoms of the disorder in question. Moncrieff contrast this with an alternative 'drug centred' model, which suggests that since psychiatric drugs are [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]], they work because they change the way people think, feel and behave. According to this model, psychiatric drugs have no specific biological effects in people with a mental disorder, and they produce their characteristic effects in everyone who takes them. The changes induced by some sorts of drugs may, however, lead to the suppression of the manifestations (symptoms) of some mental disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moncrieff |first1=J. |last2=Cohen |first2=D. |date=April 2005 |title=Rethinking models of psychotropic drug action |journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=145\u2013153 |pmid=15832065 |doi=10.1159/000083999 }}</ref>  ''The Myth of the Chemical Cure'' traces the emergence and development of the disease-centred model from the 1950s onwards.

Moncrieff developed two alternative 'models' for understanding what drugs might be doing when they are prescribed to people with mental health problems. The current mainstream understanding of psychiatric drug action is based on a 'disease-centred' model that suggests that drugs work by rectifying the underlying abnormality that is presumed to lead to the symptoms of the disorder in question. Moncrieff contrast this with an alternative 'drug centred' model, which suggests that since psychiatric drugs are [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]], they work because they change the way people think, feel and behave. According to this model, psychiatric drugs have no specific biological effects in people with a mental disorder, and they produce their characteristic effects in everyone who takes them. The changes induced by some sorts of drugs may, however, lead to the suppression of the manifestations (symptoms) of some mental disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Moncrieff |first1=J. |last2=Cohen |first2=D. |date=April 2005 |title=Rethinking models of psychotropic drug action |journal=Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics |volume=74 |issue=3 |pages=145\u2013153 |pmid=15832065 |doi=10.1159/000083999 }}</ref>  ''The Myth of the Chemical Cure'' traces the emergence and development of the disease-centred model from the 1950s onwards.
