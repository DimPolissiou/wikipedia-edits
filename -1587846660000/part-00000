The song was written by [[Jim Jonsin]], [[Rico Love]], Daniel Morris and [[Lil Wayne]], with Jonsin producing the song and Lil Wayne having featured vocals. The [[Contemporary R&B|R&B]] slow-jam serves as the [[lead single]] from ''Here I Am'' and was released from April 8, 2011. Upon release, \"Motivation\" received favorable reviews from critics generally praising the sexiness of the song. Official remixes were produced for the song, including a [[dubstep]]-inspired [[electronic music|electronic]] mix by [[Diplo (producer)|Diplo]] and a rap remix by [[Busta Rhymes]], [[Trey Songz]] and [[Fabolous]].\n\nIn the United States, the song has peaked at number one on the [[Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs]] chart where it stayed seven weeks in a row, and number seventeen on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], becoming Rowland's second US top 20 hit (fourth top 30 overall) and her second highest performing single to date as a solo artist, behind \"[[Dilemma (song)|Dilemma]]\". It was certified [[double platinum]] by the [[RIAA]] in May 2013.\n\nAn accompanying music video was directed by Sarah Chatfield, the director behind Rowland's previous video \"[[Forever and a Day (Kelly Rowland song)|Forever and a Day]]\" (2010). It follows a number of sultry scenes where Rowland dances seductively amongst partially dressed dancers in a dimly-lit warehouse, with the entire video tinged in blue light. \"Motivation\" was nominated for the [[Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration]] at the [[54th Grammy Awards]]. Rowland sang the song with Trey Songz at the [[BET Awards of 2011|2011 BET Awards]] ceremony.\n\n==Background and release==\n''Here I Am'' was originally scheduled for release in 2010, but was pushed back numerous times.

United States on June 29, 2007. It featured [[quad-band]] [[GSM]] cellular connectivity with [[GPRS]] and [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] support for data transfer.\n\nDevelopment of the iPhone dated back to 2005, when former Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] conceived the idea. The design was expanded upon over the next 2 years in complete secrecy, before being announced in Q1 of 2007.\n\nAlthough several aspects of the iPhone are considered obsolete by current standards, the device is seen as a prototype for current cell phones, eliminating most physical hardware buttons and stylus in favor of a touch-based user interface. Its successor, the [[iPhone 3G]], was announced in June 2008.\n\n==History==\n{{main | History of iPhone}}\nIn 2005, Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] conceived an idea of using a [[touchscreen]] to interact with a computer in a way in which he could directly type onto the display, instead of requiring a stylus which was common on existing technology of the time. He decided that the device would require a triple layered [[Capacitive touchscreen|capacitive]] [[multi-touch]] [[touch screen]], a very new and advanced technology at the time. This helped out with removing the physical [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], the same as a [[tablet computer]]. Jobs recruited a group of Apple engineers to investigate the idea as a side project.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen |first=Peter |url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php |title=Macworld Expo Keynote Live Update |publisher=[[Macworld]] |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=February 1, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127110536/http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php |archivedate=January 27, 2007 }}</ref> When Jobs reviewed the prototype and its [[user interface]], he saw the potential in developing the concept into a mobile phone.<ref>{{cite video\n |people=[[Walter Mossberg]]; [[Kara Swisher]] \n |date=June 2, 2010 \n |title=D8: Steve Jobs on the iPhone's Origin \n |url=http://allthingsd.com/20100601/d8-video-steve-jobs-on-the-origins-of-the-ipad/ \n |publisher=All Things Digital \n |accessdate=June 20, 2010 \n |time=0:20 \n |url-status=live \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525110502/http://allthingsd.com/20100601/d8-video-steve-jobs-on-the-origins-of-the-ipad/ \n |archivedate=May 25, 2011 \n}}</ref> The whole effort was called Project Purple 2 and began in 2005.<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Murtazin \n |first=Eldar \n |url=http://mobile-review.com/articles/2010/iphone-history3-en.shtml \n |title=Apple's Phone: From 1980s' Sketches to iPhone.

'''iPhone''' (colloquially known, [[retronym|retronymically]], as the '''iPhone 2G''', '''the first iPhone''', and '''iPhone 1''' after 2008 to differentiate it from later models) is the first

United States on June 29, 2007. It featured [[quad-band]] [[GSM]] cellular connectivity with [[GPRS]] and [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] support for data transfer.\n\nDevelopment of the iPhone dated back to 2005, when former Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] conceived the idea. The design was expanded upon over the next 2 years in complete secrecy, before being announced in Q1 of 2007.\n\nAlthough several aspects of the iPhone are considered obsolete by current standards, the device is seen as a prototype for current cell phones, eliminating most physical hardware buttons and stylus in favor of a touch-based user interface. Its successor, the [[iPhone 3G]], was announced in June 2008.\n\n==History==\n{{main | History of iPhone}}\nIn 2005, Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]] conceived an idea of using a [[touchscreen]] to interact with a computer in a way in which he could directly type onto the display, instead of requiring a stylus which was common on existing technology of the time. He decided that the device would require a triple layered [[Capacitive touchscreen|capacitive]] [[multi-touch]] [[touch screen]], a very new and advanced technology at the time. This helped out with removing the physical [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] and [[mouse (computing)|mouse]], the same as a [[tablet computer]]. Jobs recruited a group of Apple engineers to investigate the idea as a side project.<ref>{{cite news|last=Cohen |first=Peter |url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php |title=Macworld Expo Keynote Live Update |publisher=[[Macworld]] |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=February 1, 2007 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070127110536/http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php |archivedate=January 27, 2007 }}</ref> When Jobs reviewed the prototype and its [[user interface]], he saw the potential in developing the concept into a mobile phone.<ref>{{cite video\n |people=[[Walter Mossberg]]; [[Kara Swisher]] \n |date=June 2, 2010 \n |title=D8: Steve Jobs on the iPhone's Origin \n |url=http://allthingsd.com/20100601/d8-video-steve-jobs-on-the-origins-of-the-ipad/ \n |publisher=All Things Digital \n |accessdate=June 20, 2010 \n |time=0:20 \n |url-status=live \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110525110502/http://allthingsd.com/20100601/d8-video-steve-jobs-on-the-origins-of-the-ipad/ \n |archivedate=May 25, 2011 \n}}</ref> The whole effort was called Project Purple 2 and began in 2005.<ref>{{cite news\n |last=Murtazin \n |first=Eldar \n |url=http://mobile-review.com/articles/2010/iphone-history3-en.shtml \n |title=Apple's Phone: From 1980s' Sketches to iPhone.

{"title_page": "Einstein synchronisation", "text_new": "'''Einstein synchronisation''' (or '''Poincar\u00e9&ndash;Einstein synchronisation''') is a [[Convention (norm)|convention]]  for synchronising clocks at different places by means of signal exchanges. This synchronisation method was used by telegraphers in the middle 19th century, but was popularized by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Albert Einstein]], who applied it to light signals and recognized its fundamental role in [[Theory of relativity|relativity theory]]. Its principal value is for clocks within a single inertial frame.\n\n==Einstein==\nAccording to [[Albert Einstein]]'s prescription from 1905, a light signal is sent at time <math>\\tau_1</math> from clock 1 to clock 2 and immediately back, e.g. by means of a mirror. Its arrival time back at clock 1 is <math>\\tau_2</math>. This synchronisation convention sets clock 2 so that the time <math>\\tau_3</math> of signal reflection is defined to be\n\n: <math>\\tau_3 = \\tau_1 + \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\tau_2 - \\tau_1) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\tau_1 + \\tau_2).</math><ref>{{Citation | author=Einstein, A. | year=1905 | title=Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=17 | pages=891\u2013921 | bibcode=1905AnP...322..891E | doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004 | issue=10 | url=http://www.pro-physik.de/Phy/pdfs/ger_890_921.pdf | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229162203/http://www.pro-physik.de/Phy/pdfs/ger_890_921.pdf | archivedate=2009-12-29 }}.\n\nSee also [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/ English translation]</ref>\n\nThe same synchronisation is achieved by \"slowly\" transporting a third clock from clock 1 to clock 2, in the limit of vanishing transport velocity. The literature discusses many other thought experiments for clock synchronisation giving the same result.\n\nThe problem is whether this synchronisation does really succeed in assigning a time label to any event in a consistent way. To that end one should find conditions under which:\n\n: (a) clocks once synchronised remain synchronised,\n: (b1) the synchronisation is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], that is any clock is synchronised with itself (automatically satisfied),\n: (b2) the synchronisation is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], that is if clock A is synchronised with clock B then clock B is synchronised with clock A,\n: (b3) the synchronisation is [[transitive relation|transitive]], that is if clock A is synchronised with clock B and clock B is synchronised with clock C then clock A is synchronised with clock C.\n\nIf point (a) holds then it makes sense to say that clocks are synchronised. Given (a), if (b1)&ndash;(b3) hold then the synchronisation allows us to build a global time function t. The slices t=const. are called \"simultaneity slices\".\n\nEinstein (1905) did not recognize the possibility of reducing (a) and (b1)&ndash;(b3) to easily verifiable physical properties of light propagation (see below). Instead he just wrote \"''We assume that this definition of synchronism is free from contradictions, and possible for any number of points; and that the following'' (that is b2&ndash;b3) ''relations are universally valid''.\"\n\nMax Von Laue<ref>{{Citation | author=Laue, M. | year=1911 | title=Das Relativit\u00e4tsprinzip | publisher=Friedr.

However, the previous conditions that guarantee the applicability of Einstein's synchronisation do not imply that the one-way light speed turns out to be the same all over the frame.

The importance of Laue-Weyl's condition stands on the fact that the time there mentioned can be measured with only one clock thus this condition does not rely on synchronisation conventions and can be experimentally checked. Indeed, it is experimentally verified that the Laue-Weyl round-trip condition holds throughout an inertial frame.\n\nSince it is meaningless to measure a one-way velocity prior to the synchronisation of distant clocks, experiments claiming a measure of the one-way speed of light can often be reinterpreted as verifying the Laue-Weyl's round-trip condition.\n\nThe Einstein synchronisation looks this natural only in [[inertial frame]]s. One can easily forget that it is only a convention. In rotating frames, even in special relativity, the non-transitivity of Einstein synchronisation diminishes its usefulness. If clock 1 and clock 2 are not synchronised directly, but by using a chain of intermediate clocks, the synchronisation depends on the path chosen. Synchronisation around the circumference of a rotating disk gives a non vanishing time difference that depends on the direction used. This is important in the [[Sagnac effect]] and the [[Ehrenfest paradox]]. The [[Global Positioning System]] accounts for this effect.\n\nA substantive discussion of Einstein synchronisation's conventionalism is due to [[Hans Reichenbach|Reichenbach]]. Most attempts to negate the conventionality of this synchronisation are considered refuted, with the notable exception of [[David B. Malament|Malament]]'s argument, that it can be derived from demanding a  symmetrical relation of causal connectability. Whether this settles the issue is disputed.\n\n==History: Poincar\u00e9==\n{{Main|History of special relativity}}\nSome features of the conventionality of synchronization were discussed by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]].<ref>Galison (2002).</ref><ref>Darrigol (2005).</ref> In 1898 (in a philosophical paper) he argued that the postulate of light speed constancy in all directions is useful to formulate physical laws in a simple way. He also showed that the definition of simultaneity of events at different places is only a convention.<ref>{{Citation|author=Poincar\u00e9, Henri|year=1898-1913|title=The foundations of science|chapter=[[s:The Measure of Time|The Measure of Time]]|place=New York|publisher=Science Press|pages=222&ndash;234}}</ref> Based on those conventions, but within the framework of the now superseded [[Lorentz ether theory|aether theory]], Poincar\u00e9 in 1900 proposed the following convention for defining clock synchronisation: 2 observers A and B, which are moving in the aether, synchronise their clocks by means of optical signals. Because of the [[relativity principle]] they believe themselves to be at rest in the aether and assume that the speed of light is constant in all directions. Therefore, they have to consider only the transmission time of the signals and then crossing their observations to examine whether their clocks are synchronous.\n\n{{Quote|Let us suppose that there are some observers placed at various points, and they synchronize their clocks using light signals. They attempt to adjust the measured transmission time of the signals, but they are not aware of their common motion, and consequently believe that the signals travel equally fast in both directions. They perform  observations of crossing signals, one traveling from A to B, followed by another traveling from B to A. The local time <math>t'</math> is the time indicated by the clocks which are so adjusted. If <math>V=\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{K_{0}}}</math> is the speed of light, and <math>v</math> is the speed of the Earth which we suppose is parallel to the <math>x</math> axis, and in the positive direction, then we have: <math>t'=t-\\tfrac{vx}{V^{2}}</math>.<ref>{{Citation|author=Poincar\u00e9, Henri|year=1900|title=La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action|journal=Archives N\u00e9erlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles|volume=5|pages=252\u2013278|title-link=s:fr:La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action}}. See also the [http://www.physicsinsights.org/poincare-1900.pdf English translation].</ref>}}\n\nIn 1904 Poincar\u00e9 illustrated the same procedure in the following way:\n\n{{Quote|Imagine two observers who wish to adjust their timepieces by optical signals; they exchange signals, but as they know that the transmission of light is not instantaneous, they are careful to cross them. When station B perceives the signal from station A, its clock should not mark the same hour as that of station A at the moment of sending the signal, but this hour augmented by a constant representing the duration of the transmission. Suppose, for example, that station A sends its signal when its clock marks the hour 0, and that station B perceives it when its clock marks the hour <math>t</math>. The clocks are adjusted if the slowness equal to t represents the duration of the transmission, and to verify it, station B sends in its turn a signal when its clock marks 0; then station A should perceive it when its clock marks <math>t</math>. The timepieces are then adjusted. And in fact they mark the same hour at the same physical instant, but on the one condition, that the two stations are fixed. Otherwise the duration of the transmission will not be the same in the two senses, since the station A, for example, moves forward to meet the optical perturbation emanating from B, whereas the station B flees before the perturbation emanating from A. The watches adjusted in that way will not mark, therefore, the true time; they will mark what may be called the ''local time'', so that one of them will be slow of the other.<ref>{{Citation|author=Poincar\u00e9, Henri|year=1904-1906|chapter=[[s:The Principles of Mathematical Physics|The Principles of Mathematical Physics]]|title=Congress of arts and science, universal exposition, St. Louis, 1904|volume=1|pages=604\u2013622|publisher=Houghton, Mifflin and Company|place=Boston and New York}}</ref>}}\n\n==See also==\n*[[Relativity of simultaneity]]\n*[[One-way speed of light]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Literature ==\n*{{Citation|author=Darrigol, Olivier|title=The Genesis of the theory of relativity|year=2005|journal=S\u00e9minaire Poincar\u00e9|volume=1|pages=1\u201322|url=http://www.bourbaphy.fr/darrigol2.pdf|doi=10.1007/3-7643-7436-5_1|bibcode=2006eins.book....1D|isbn=978-3-7643-7435-8}}\n* [[Dennis Dieks|D.

This synchronisation method was used by telegraphers in the middle 19th century, but was popularized by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]] and [[Albert Einstein]], who applied it to light signals and recognized its fundamental role in [[Theory of relativity|relativity theory]]. Its principal value is for clocks within a single inertial frame.\n\n==Einstein==\nAccording to [[Albert Einstein]]'s prescription from 1905, a light signal is sent at time <math>\\tau_1</math> from clock 1 to clock 2 and immediately back, e.g. by means of a mirror. Its arrival time back at clock 1 is <math>\\tau_2</math>. This synchronisation convention sets clock 2 so that the time <math>\\tau_3</math> of signal reflection is defined to be\n\n: <math>\\tau_3 = \\tau_1 + \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\tau_2 - \\tau_1) = \\tfrac{1}{2}(\\tau_1 + \\tau_2).</math><ref>{{Citation | author=Einstein, A. | year=1905 | title=Zur Elektrodynamik bewegter K\u00f6rper | journal=Annalen der Physik | volume=17 | pages=891\u2013921 | bibcode=1905AnP...322..891E | doi=10.1002/andp.19053221004 | issue=10 | url=http://www.pro-physik.de/Phy/pdfs/ger_890_921.pdf | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229162203/http://www.pro-physik.de/Phy/pdfs/ger_890_921.pdf | archivedate=2009-12-29 }}.\n\nSee also [http://www.fourmilab.ch/etexts/einstein/specrel/ English translation]</ref>\n\nThe same synchronisation is achieved by \"slowly\" transporting a third clock from clock 1 to clock 2, in the limit of vanishing transport velocity. The literature discusses many other thought experiments for clock synchronisation giving the same result.\n\nThe problem is whether this synchronisation does really succeed in assigning a time label to any event in a consistent way. To that end one should find conditions under which:\n\n: (a) clocks once synchronised remain synchronised,\n: (b1) the synchronisation is [[reflexive relation|reflexive]], that is any clock is synchronised with itself (automatically satisfied),\n: (b2) the synchronisation is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], that is if clock A is synchronised with clock B then clock B is synchronised with clock A,\n: (b3) the synchronisation is [[transitive relation|transitive]], that is if clock A is synchronised with clock B and clock B is synchronised with clock C then clock A is synchronised with clock C.\n\nIf point (a) holds then it makes sense to say that clocks are synchronised. Given (a), if (b1)&ndash;(b3) hold then the synchronisation allows us to build a global time function t. The slices t=const. are called \"simultaneity slices\".\n\nEinstein (1905) did not recognize the possibility of reducing (a) and (b1)&ndash;(b3) to easily verifiable physical properties of light propagation (see below). Instead he just wrote \"''We assume that this definition of synchronism is free from contradictions, and possible for any number of points; and that the following'' (that is b2&ndash;b3) ''relations are universally valid''.\"\n\nMax Von Laue<ref>{{Citation | author=Laue, M. | year=1911 | title=Das Relativit\u00e4tsprinzip | publisher=Friedr.

Reichenbach,<ref>{{Citation | author=Reichenbach, H. | year=1969 | title=Axiomatization of the Theory of Relativity | publisher=University of California Press | place=Berkeley }}.</ref> and found a final shape in a work by A.

However, the previous conditions that guarantee the applicability of Einstein's synchronisation do not imply that the one-way light speed turns out to be the same all over the frame. Consider\n\n* (''[[Max von Laue|Laue]]-[[Hermann Weyl|Weyl's]] round-trip condition'') The time needed by a light beam to traverse a closed path of length L is L/c, where L is the length of the path and c is a constant independent of the path.\n\nA theorem<ref>{{Citation |author1=Minguzzi, E.  |author2=Macdonald, A. | year=2003 | title=Universal one-way light speed from a universal light speed over closed paths | journal=Foundations of Physics Letters| volume =16 | pages =593\u2013604 | doi=10.1023/B:FOPL.0000012785.16203.52|arxiv = gr-qc/0211091 |bibcode = 2003FoPhL..16..593M | issue=6 }}</ref> (whose origin can be traced back to von Laue and Weyl)<ref>{{Citation | author=Weyl, H. | year=1988 | title=Raum Zeit Materie | publisher=Springer-Verlag | place=New York }}  Seventh edition based on the fifth German edition (1923).</ref> states that Laue-Weyl's round trip condition holds if and only if the Einstein synchronisation can be applied consistently (i.e. (a) and (b1)&ndash;(b3) hold) and the one-way speed of light with respect to the so synchronised clocks is a constant all over the frame. The importance of Laue-Weyl's condition stands on the fact that the time there mentioned can be measured with only one clock thus this condition does not rely on synchronisation conventions and can be experimentally checked. Indeed, it is experimentally verified that the Laue-Weyl round-trip condition holds throughout an inertial frame.\n\nSince it is meaningless to measure a one-way velocity prior to the synchronisation of distant clocks, experiments claiming a measure of the one-way speed of light can often be reinterpreted as verifying the Laue-Weyl's round-trip condition.\n\nThe Einstein synchronisation looks this natural only in [[inertial frame]]s. One can easily forget that it is only a convention. In rotating frames, even in special relativity, the non-transitivity of Einstein synchronisation diminishes its usefulness. If clock 1 and clock 2 are not synchronised directly, but by using a chain of intermediate clocks, the synchronisation depends on the path chosen. Synchronisation around the circumference of a rotating disk gives a non vanishing time difference that depends on the direction used. This is important in the [[Sagnac effect]] and the [[Ehrenfest paradox]]. The [[Global Positioning System]] accounts for this effect.\n\nA substantive discussion of Einstein synchronisation's conventionalism is due to [[Hans Reichenbach|Reichenbach]]. Most attempts to negate the conventionality of this synchronisation are considered refuted, with the notable exception of [[David B. Malament|Malament]]'s argument, that it can be derived from demanding a  symmetrical relation of causal connectibility. Whether this settles the issue is disputed.\n\n==History: Poincar\u00e9==\n{{Main|History of special relativity}}\nSome features of the conventionality of synchronization were discussed by [[Henri Poincar\u00e9]].<ref>Galison (2002).</ref><ref>Darrigol (2005).</ref> In 1898 (in a philosophical paper) he argued that the postulate of light speed constancy in all directions is useful to formulate physical laws in a simple way. He also showed that the definition of simultaneity of events at different places is only a convention.<ref>{{Citation|author=Poincar\u00e9, Henri|year=1898-1913|title=The foundations of science|chapter=[[s:The Measure of Time|The Measure of Time]]|place=New York|publisher=Science Press|pages=222&ndash;234}}</ref> Based on those conventions, but within the framework of the now superseded [[Lorentz ether theory|aether theory]], Poincar\u00e9 in 1900 proposed the following convention for defining clock synchronisation: 2 observers A and B, which are moving in the aether, synchronise their clocks by means of optical signals. Because of the [[relativity principle]] they believe themselves to be at rest in the aether and assume that the speed of light is constant in all directions. Therefore, they have to consider only the transmission time of the signals and then crossing their observations to examine whether their clocks are synchronous.\n\n{{Quote|Let us suppose that there are some observers placed at various points, and they synchronize their clocks using light signals. They attempt to adjust the measured transmission time of the signals, but they are not aware of their common motion, and consequently believe that the signals travel equally fast in both directions. They perform  observations of crossing signals, one traveling from A to B, followed by another traveling from B to A. The local time <math>t'</math> is the time indicated by the clocks which are so adjusted. If <math>V=\\tfrac{1}{\\sqrt{K_{0}}}</math> is the speed of light, and <math>v</math> is the speed of the Earth which we suppose is parallel to the <math>x</math> axis, and in the positive direction, then we have: <math>t'=t-\\tfrac{vx}{V^{2}}</math>.<ref>{{Citation|author=Poincar\u00e9, Henri|year=1900|title=La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action|journal=Archives N\u00e9erlandaises des Sciences Exactes et Naturelles|volume=5|pages=252\u2013278|title-link=s:fr:La th\u00e9orie de Lorentz et le principe de r\u00e9action}}. See also the [http://www.physicsinsights.org/poincare-1900.pdf English translation].</ref>}}\n\nIn 1904 Poincar\u00e9 illustrated the same procedure in the following way:\n\n{{Quote|Imagine two observers who wish to adjust their timepieces by optical signals; they exchange signals, but as they know that the transmission of light is not instantaneous, they are careful to cross them. When station B perceives the signal from station A, its clock should not mark the same hour as that of station A at the moment of sending the signal, but this hour augmented by a constant representing the duration of the transmission. Suppose, for example, that station A sends its signal when its clock marks the hour 0, and that station B perceives it when its clock marks the hour <math>t</math>. The clocks are adjusted if the slowness equal to t represents the duration of the transmission, and to verify it, station B sends in its turn a signal when its clock marks 0; then station A should perceive it when its clock marks <math>t</math>. The timepieces are then adjusted. And in fact they mark the same hour at the same physical instant, but on the one condition, that the two stations are fixed. Otherwise the duration of the transmission will not be the same in the two senses, since the station A, for example, moves forward to meet the optical perturbation emanating from B, whereas the station B flees before the perturbation emanating from A.
