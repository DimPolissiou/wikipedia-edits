Kjellberg's channel was the [[List of most-subscribed YouTube channels|most-subscribed channel on YouTube]] for more than five years from 2013 to 2019.\n\nAfter registering his eponymous YouTube channel in 2010, Kjellberg primarily posted Let's Play videos of horror and action video games. His channel experienced substantial growth in popularity over the next two years and he reached 1 million subscribers in July 2012. Over time, his style of content diversified to include vlogs, comedy shorts, formatted shows, and music videos. \n\nKjellberg became the most-subscribed YouTuber on 15 August 2013 (being briefly surpassed in late 2013 by [[YouTube (channel)|YouTube Spotlight]]) and held the title until early 2019 when he [[PewDiePie vs T-Series|publicly vied for it]] with [[India]]n record label [[T-Series (company)|T-Series]], until the latter established a significant lead in April that year.

Subject/Law !! Long guns!! Handguns !! Relevant statutes !! Notes\n|-\n| State permit required to purchase? || Yes || Yes || || A lifetime purchaser identification card is required for purchase of rifles and shotguns, as well as for purchases of handgun ammunition. A permit to purchase a handgun, valid for 90 days is required for each handgun purchase. Only one handgun can be purchased within a 30-day period. According to state law, purchase permits/identification cards are supposed to be granted on a ''Shall-Issue'' basis, but in practice many issuing authorities require the applicant to justify the need for a firearm before granting approval for the permit/ID card.  Some issuing authorities have been known to arbitrarily deny purchase permits and ID cards.\n|-\n| Firearm registration? || No || Yes || || The NJ State Police Firearms Investigation Unit (NJSP FIU) maintains a record of all handgun transfers, except for inherited firearms willed to the transferee, or firearms brought to the state by new residents moving to the state.  Firearm registration is voluntary, but since handgun purchase permits are also a form of register, there is de facto mandatory handgun registration for handguns purchased in-state. Purchases by NJ residents must either be from a licensed dealer in NJ or a private individual who is a resident of NJ. In both dealer purchases and private sales, a copy of the purchase permit is sent to the NJSP FIU. A NICS background check at the point of sale is only required for purchases from dealers.\n|-\n| Owner license required? || No || No || || No license is required to own any firearm in New Jersey, except an assault firearm or NFA regulated firearms\n|-\n| Permit required for concealed carry? || N/A || Yes || [http://www.state.nj.us/njsp/info/pdf/firearms/njac-title13-ch54.pdf N.J. Admin. Code \u00a7 13:54] || New Jersey calls its permit a \"permit to carry a handgun\" and is a \"may-issue\" by law for firearm carry, either openly or concealed, but permits are rarely or never granted to the general populace. Permit applicants must \"specify in detail the urgent necessity for self-protection, as evidenced by specific threats or previous attacks which demonstrate a special danger to the applicant's life that cannot be avoided by means other than by issuance of a permit to carry a handgun.\" Then it must be approved by both the township's police chief and a NJ judge, whereas the applicant will not know who denied the $200 application to carry. As a result of this tough standard, New Jersey is effectively a \"no issue\" state unless one is a retired law enforcement officer or an individual with political connections. Armed security officers and armored car drivers typically get restricted permits limited to carry while on duty only. A letter of need from the security company is required. \n|-\n| Permit required for open carry? || No || Yes || || Open carry is allowed only with a permit to carry a handgun and is generally not practiced except by security officers and others who carry firearms on duty.

To purchase a handgun, a separate permit is needed from the Chief of Police of their municipality, or the Superintendent of State Police if the municipality does not have a local police department. A permit is required for each handgun to be purchased and expires after 90 days but may be extended for an additional 90 days at the discretion of the Chief of Police or Superintendent of State Police. These, like the initial Firearms Purchaser Identification Card (FID), are provided to applicants on a shall-issue basis. They require in-depth application questioning, multiple references and background checks via the State Bureau of Identification and [[New Jersey State Police]]; however, authorities do not have discretion and must issue permits to applicants who satisfy the criteria described in the statutes. Reasons for denial include being convicted of a crime (equivalent to a [[felony]]) or disorderly persons offense (equivalent to a [[misdemeanor]]) in the case of [[domestic violence]]. As of August 2013 anyone on the [[terror watchlist]] is also disqualified. \n\nNJ law states that Firearms Identification approval and/or handgun purchase permit(s) must be issued within 30 days. However, this is not always adhered to with some applicants waiting months to receive their permits. Applicants are able to appeal the denial of permits. The Firearm Purchaser ID card is also required to purchase handgun ammunition at dealers in the state. \"Handgun ammunition\" is interpreted as any caliber that can be used in a handgun, therefore some calibers that are typically used in rifles and shotguns require one to show a FPIC to purchase.\n\nPrivate firearm transfers require a background check conducted through a federally licensed gun dealer.  The dealer is required to keep a record of the sale.  There are limited exceptions, including for transfers between members of an immediate family and for law enforcement officers.<ref name=HuffPo>{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Wing |date=June 13, 2018 |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-jersey-gun-laws_us_5b203d57e4b0bbb7a0e2849b |title=New Jersey's Tough Gun Laws Just Got Even Stronger |website=Huffington Post |access-date=July 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=May 21, 2018 |url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2018/Bills/A3000/2757_S2.PDF |title=Assembly Bill No. 2757 (1R) |website=New Jersey Legislature |access-date=July 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Forms required by municipalities===\n{{Cite NJSA|title=2C|chapter=58|section=3|subsection=f}}:\n\n{{quote|There shall be no conditions or requirements added to the form or content of the application, or required by the licensing authority for the issuance of a permit or identification card, other than those that are specifically set forth in this chapter.}}\n\nOnly two forms are required to obtain a FPIC or permit to purchase a handgun: the \"Application for Firearms Purchaser Identification Card and/or Handgun Purchase Permit\", STS-33, and \"Consent For Mental Health Records Search\", SP-66. Additionally, the Chief of Police for the Municipality or the Superintendent of State Police may require an applicant to be fingerprinted or complete a \"Request for Criminal History Record Information\", form SBI 212A.  Fingerprinting is usually done at private facilities such as [[Morpho (Safran)]] and the SBI 212A form can be submitted online or on paper. The method of submission is determined by the local police department. Many police departments and the NJSP are moving toward online submission and phasing out the paper SBI 212A.\n\nSome municipalities have required additional forms, photographs and other requirements such as notarization. These forms are not required for approval per NJSA 2C:58-3a. This has been affirmed by the Appellate Court in  two cases, one against the City of Paterson by resident Jeremy Perez, and another against Jersey City by resident Michael McGovern where the court ruled against the cities in violation.<ref>http://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-unpublished/2014/a1282-12.html</ref><ref>http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/12/jersey_city_man_gets_gun_permit_after_three-year_legal_war.html</ref><ref>http://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-unpublished/2014/a0498-12.html</ref>\n\n===Fees===\nEach FPIC application fee is $5 and each permit to purchase a handgun is $2. Fingerprinting is charged a fee by the private facility contracted by the state, approximately $50 to $60. The SBI 212A \"Request for Criminal History Record Information\" application fee is $18 if submitted on paper or $20 if submitted online. Each police department has its own policy with regard to which method they choose for background checks. Some may require fingerprinting for each application, but most only require it for the initial FPIC.\n\nNew Jersey limits handgun purchases to one per 30-day period. Upon completing a New Jersey State police form, an FID card holder may be granted permission to purchase more than one handgun a month by declaring good reason. Reasons may include: recreational shooting; the purposes of collectors; when it is required for certain employment;  and when obtaining firearms as the beneficiary of a will.<ref>Graber, Trish G.

In practice, very few permits are granted; normally only individuals with political connections are able to obtain handgun carry permits. Many applicants have reported difficulty in obtaining New Jersey Permits to Carry, especially non-residents. Most people do not even bother to apply since denial is almost a certainty and any denial must be disclosed on subsequent applications for permits to purchase a firearm, which is cause for a future firearms purchase to be denied.

As of the end of 2013, there were 1,212 active Handgun Carry Permits in New Jersey, out of a population of nearly 9 million residents.<ref>[Concealed Carry Permit Holders Across the United States, Crime Prevention Research Center, July 9, 2014]</ref>\n\n===Carry to exempted locations===\nThere are a few exempted locations where one may carry and possess firearms. These locations are your home, place of business, premises or land possessed, or to a gunsmith for purposes of repair. Members of rifle or pistol clubs that submit their names to the state police annually are allowed to possess and transport their firearms to \"a place of target practice.\"  Those who are not members of a rifle or pistol club can carry their firearms to  \"an authorized target range.\" One may also carry firearms to the woods or fields or waters of the state for purposes of hunting or fishing. One must have a valid hunting or fishing license and the firearms must be appropriate for hunting or fishing to be covered under this exemption.\n\n===Interstate transportation of unloaded firearms===\nInterstate transportation is covered under the Safe Passage provision of the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA), 18 USC \u00a7 926A, which states:\n\n{{quote|Notwithstanding any other provision of any law or any rule or regulation of a State or any political subdivision thereof, any person who is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter from transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm shall be entitled to transport a firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm if, during such transportation the firearm is unloaded, and neither the firearm nor any ammunition being transported is readily accessible or is directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting vehicle: Provided, That in the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the driver's compartment the firearm or ammunition shall be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console.}}\n\nHowever, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in ''Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs v. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey'' has found that this provision only applies to transporting a firearm in a vehicle, and that carrying a firearm in a locked container in checked luggage in an airport terminal to declare it to the airline constitutes unlawful possession and is not protected under the law. This decision was a direct result of a 2005 incident where Gregg C. Revell, a Utah Resident with a valid Utah Concealed Firearm Permit was traveling through [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]] en route to Allentown, Pennsylvania. Because of a missed flight, he was given his luggage, which included a properly checked firearm, and was forced to spend the night in a hotel in New Jersey. When he returned to the airport the following day to check his handgun for the last portion of the trip, he was arrested for illegal possession of a firearm. Revell lost his lawsuit after The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held in ''Gregg C. Revell v. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey'', [222] held that \"Section 926A does not apply to Revell because his firearm and ammunition were readily accessible to him during his stay in New Jersey.\" This opinion will apply to NJ airports. If you miss a flight or for any other reason your flight is interrupted and the airline tries to return you luggage that includes a checked firearm, you cannot take possession of the firearm if you are taking a later flight. The Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs (ANJRPC) later also sued the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which resulted in a similar decision.\n\n==Assault firearms and magazine capacity==\n\nFirearms classed as \"assault firearms\" but acquired before May 1, 1990, and registered with the state are legal to possess. Police officers may possess assault weapons for duty purposes and may possess personal assault weapons with recommendation by their agency. FFLs are also allowed to possess \"assault firearms.\"\n\n===Assault firearm feature criteria===\n\nUnder New Jersey law, a firearm is classified as an \"[[Assault weapons legislation in the United States|assault firearm]]\" if it meets the following criteria:<ref>5.N.J.

According to state law, purchase permits/identification cards are supposed to be granted on a ''Shall-Issue'' basis, but in practice many issuing authorities require the applicant to justify the need for a firearm before granting approval for the permit/ID card.

Purchases by NJ residents must either be from a licensed dealer in NJ or a private individual who is a resident of NJ.

However, hollow-point bullets may not be carried outside of a place of target practice, dwelling, premises or land possessed by a person, even if one has a valid permit to carry a handgun, except when being transported directly to and from these places. LEOSA (HR 218) qualified and retired or separated LEOs carrying anywhere in the USA are exempt from  state laws and may legally carry hollow points ammo or any ammo that is not prohibited under the Gun Control Act of 1968 or the National Firearm Act.<ref>\"TITLE 13.

To purchase a handgun, a separate permit is needed from the Chief of Police of their municipality, or the Superintendent of State Police if the municipality does not have a local police department. A permit is required for each handgun to be purchased and expires after 90 days but may be extended for an additional 90 days at the discretion of the Chief of Police or Superintendent of State Police. These, like the initial Firearms Purchaser Identification Card (FID), are provided to applicants on a shall-issue basis. They require in-depth application questioning, multiple references and background checks via the State Bureau of Identification and [[New Jersey State Police]]; however, authorities do not have discretion and must issue permits to applicants who satisfy the criteria described in the statutes. Reasons for denial include being convicted of a crime (equivalent to a [[felony]]) or disorderly persons offense (equivalent to a [[misdemeanor]]) in the case of [[domestic violence]]. As of August 2013 anyone on the [[terror watchlist]] is also disqualified. \n\nNJ law states that Firearms Identification approval and/or handgun purchase permit(s) must be issued within 30 days. However, this is not always adhered to with some applicants waiting months to receive their permits. Applicants are able to appeal the denial of permits. The Firearm Purchaser ID card is also required to purchase handgun ammunition at dealers in the state. \"Handgun ammunition\" is interpreted as any caliber that can be used in a handgun, therefore some calibers that are typically used in rifles and shotguns require one to show a FPIC to purchase.\n\nPrivate firearm transfers require a background check conducted through a federally licensed gun dealer.  The dealer is required to keep a record of the sale.  There are limited exceptions, including for transfers between members of an immediate family and for law enforcement officers.<ref name=HuffPo>{{cite web |first=Nick |last=Wing |date=June 13, 2018 |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/new-jersey-gun-laws_us_5b203d57e4b0bbb7a0e2849b |title=New Jersey's Tough Gun Laws Just Got Even Stronger |website=Huffington Post |access-date=July 7, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=May 21, 2018 |url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2018/Bills/A3000/2757_S2.PDF |title=Assembly Bill No. 2757 (1R) |website=New Jersey Legislature |access-date=July 7, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Forms required by municipalities===\n{{Cite NJSA|title=2C|chapter=58|section=3|subsection=f}}:\n\n{{quote|There shall be no conditions or requirements added to the form or content of the application, or required by the licensing authority for the issuance of a permit or identification card, other than those that are specifically set forth in this chapter.}}\n\nOnly two forms are required to obtain a FPIC or permit to purchase a handgun: the \"Application for Firearms Purchaser Identification Card and/or Handgun Purchase Permit\", STS-33, and \"Consent For Mental Health Records Search\", SP-66. Additionally, the Chief of Police for the Municipality or the Superintendent of State Police may require an applicant to be fingerprinted or complete a \"Request for Criminal History Record Information\", form SBI 212A.  Fingerprinting is usually done at private facilities such as [[Morpho (Safran)]] and the SBI 212A form can be submitted online or on paper. The method of submission is determined by the local police department. Many police departments and the NJSP are moving toward online submission and phasing out the paper SBI 212A.\n\nSome municipalities have required additional forms, photographs and other requirements such as notarization. These forms are not required for approval per NJSA 2C:58-3a. This has been affirmed by the Appellate Court in  two cases, one against the City of Paterson by resident Jeremy Perez, and another against Jersey City by resident Michael McGovern where the court ruled against the cities in violation.<ref>http://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-unpublished/2014/a1282-12.html</ref><ref>http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2014/12/jersey_city_man_gets_gun_permit_after_three-year_legal_war.html</ref><ref>http://law.justia.com/cases/new-jersey/appellate-division-unpublished/2014/a0498-12.html</ref>\n\n===Fees===\nEach FPIC application fee is $5 and each permit to purchase a handgun is $2. Fingerprinting is charged a fee by the private facility contracted by the state, approximately $50 to $60. The SBI 212A \"Request for Criminal History Record Information\" application fee is $18 if submitted on paper or $20 if submitted online. Each police department has its own policy with regard to which method they choose for background checks. Some may require fingerprinting for each application, but most only require it for the initial FPIC.\n\nNew Jersey limits handgun purchases to one per 30-day period. Upon completing a New Jersey State police form, an FID card holder may be granted permission to purchase more than one handgun a month by declaring good reason. Reasons may include: recreational shooting; the purposes of collectors; when it is required for certain employment;  and when obtaining firearms as the beneficiary of a will.<ref>Graber, Trish G.

Armored car employees are required to apply to the Superintendent of State Police. Non-residents may apply to the Superintendent of State Police.

In practice, very few permits are granted; normally only individuals with political connections are able to obtain handgun carry permits. Many applicants have reported difficulty in obtaining New Jersey Permits to Carry, especially non-residents. Most people do not even bother to apply since denial is almost a certainty and any denial must be disclosed on subsequent applications for permits to purchase a firearm, which is cause for a future firearms purchase to be denied. Registered and licensed private security officers and private investigators encounter less difficulty, however their permits are usually heavily scrutinized and restricted to carry while on duty only.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Roma|first1=James|title=Registered and licensed private|url=http://www.art375.org/private-investigator-license-nj/|accessdate=22 November 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181016032811/http://www.art375.org/private-investigator-license-nj/|archive-date=16 October 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nRetired law enforcement officers are eligible to obtain a permit to carry a handgun without specific justifiable need, pursuant to {{Cite NJSA|title=2C|chapter=39|section=6|subsection=l}}.

There is no requirement for qualified retired or separated officers to apply for the state permit when carrying under LEOSA (H.R. 218) since the federal law trumps state law.  As of the end of 2013, there were 1,212 active Handgun Carry Permits in New Jersey, out of a population of nearly 9 million residents.<ref>[Concealed Carry Permit Holders Across the United States, Crime Prevention Research Center, July 9, 2014]</ref>\n\n===Carry to exempted locations===\nThere are a few exempted locations where one may carry and possess firearms. These locations are your home, place of business, premises or land possessed, or to a gunsmith for purposes of repair. Members of rifle or pistol clubs that submit their names to the state police annually are allowed to possess and transport their firearms to \"a place of target practice.\"  Those who are not members of a rifle or pistol club can carry their firearms to  \"an authorized target range.\" One may also carry firearms to the woods or fields or waters of the state for purposes of hunting or fishing. One must have a valid hunting or fishing license and the firearms must be appropriate for hunting or fishing to be covered under this exemption.\n\n===Interstate transportation of unloaded firearms===\nInterstate transportation is covered under the Safe Passage provision of the Firearm Owners Protection Act (FOPA), 18 USC \u00a7 926A, which states:\n\n{{quote|Notwithstanding any other provision of any law or any rule or regulation of a State or any political subdivision thereof, any person who is not otherwise prohibited by this chapter from transporting, shipping, or receiving a firearm shall be entitled to transport a firearm for any lawful purpose from any place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm to any other place where he may lawfully possess and carry such firearm if, during such transportation the firearm is unloaded, and neither the firearm nor any ammunition being transported is readily accessible or is directly accessible from the passenger compartment of such transporting vehicle: Provided, That in the case of a vehicle without a compartment separate from the driver's compartment the firearm or ammunition shall be contained in a locked container other than the glove compartment or console.}}\n\nHowever, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in ''Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs v. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey'' has found that this provision only applies to transporting a firearm in a vehicle, and that carrying a firearm in a locked container in checked luggage in an airport terminal to declare it to the airline constitutes unlawful possession and is not protected under the law. This decision was a direct result of a 2005 incident where Gregg C. Revell, a Utah Resident with a valid Utah Concealed Firearm Permit was traveling through [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]] en route to Allentown, Pennsylvania. Because of a missed flight, he was given his luggage, which included a properly checked firearm, and was forced to spend the night in a hotel in New Jersey. When he returned to the airport the following day to check his handgun for the last portion of the trip, he was arrested for illegal possession of a firearm. Revell lost his lawsuit after The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held in ''Gregg C. Revell v. Port Authority of New York and New Jersey'', [222] held that \"Section 926A does not apply to Revell because his firearm and ammunition were readily accessible to him during his stay in New Jersey.\" This opinion will apply to NJ airports. If you miss a flight or for any other reason your flight is interrupted and the airline tries to return you luggage that includes a checked firearm, you cannot take possession of the firearm if you are taking a later flight. The Association of New Jersey Rifle and Pistol Clubs (ANJRPC) later also sued the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which resulted in a similar decision.\n\n==Assault firearms and magazine capacity==\n\nFirearms classed as \"assault firearms\" but acquired before May 1, 1990, and registered with the state are legal to possess. Police officers may possess assault weapons for duty purposes and may possess personal assault weapons with recommendation by their agency. FFLs are also allowed to possess \"assault firearms.\"\n\n===Assault firearm feature criteria===\n\nUnder New Jersey law, a firearm is classified as an \"[[Assault weapons legislation in the United States|assault firearm]]\" if it meets the following criteria:<ref>5.N.J.

T. Vasudevan Nair]], and starring [[Mammootty]], [[Balan K. Nair]], [[Suresh Gopi]], [[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]], [[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]] and [[Captain Raju]]. The film won four [[National Film Awards]] (1989) including [[National Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Mammootty), [[National Film Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] (M. T. Vasudevan Nair), [[National Film Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] and [[National Film Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] ([[P. Krishnamoorthy]]) and six [[Kerala State Film Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set in 16th-century northern Kerala. The plot unfolds at Puthooram, the house of great Kannappan Chekavar. Kannappan Chekavar adopts the son of his estranged sister when the boy loses both his parents and brings him to Puthooram to live and learn with his cousins. The orphan boy, Chandu, a quick learner, earns the love and admiration of his uncle, while he is loathed by his cousin [[Aromal Chekavar|Aromal]].\n\nAs they grow up Chandu is betrothed to Chekavar's daughter, [[Unniyarcha]]. Several events unfold where in Chandu finds himself being pushed to the corner by his cousin. He flees to the kalari under the guidance of Tulunadan expert and master Chekavar, Aringodar.\n\nChandu has to recount only losses in his life, as Aromal ensures his sister is not married to Chandu. He even deceives Chandu by usurping and marrying Kunjinooli (Chithra), who was in love with Chandu. The heartbroken Chandu moves ahead and continues to master the art of Kalari Payattu from Aringodar.\n\nOn wedding day of Aromal, Unniyarcha invites Chandu to her room. However Unniyarcha's husband, the eunuch Kunjiraman sees them. Unniyarcha, the clever vixen that she is, convinces her husband that Chandu broke into her room as she was awaiting the arrival of Kunjiraman. Chandu gets a sobriquet: 'Womanizer Chandu.' A dejected Chandu finds solace in Kunji, Aringodar\u2019s daughter.\n\nFeudal lord Unnichandror (Ramu) arrives at the footsteps of Aringodar and invites him to represent his cause in an angam (duel unto death) against mooppu feud with his brother Unnikonar. Unnikonar, in turn, invites Aromal to represent him. Chandu is now caught in a dilemma, when his uncle requests him to play second hand to Aromal in the angam against his teacher Aringodar. Unniyarcha also appears and offers to live with Chandu if he assists Aromal to win against Aringodar. A tempted Chandu, decides to second Aromal. Chandu takes on the task of revitalizing Aromal's swords by providing them for treatment to the blacksmith. However, Kunji, Aringodar\u2019s daughter, bribes the blacksmith and makes them brittle.\n\nOn the day of the duel, Aromal, though highly skilled, is no match for the master Aringodar. To add to the misery, Aromal's sword breaks in two. As Chandu placates an attacking Aringodar, seeking time to replace the weapon, Aringodar obliges. Then wily Aromal throws his broken sword and kills an unguarded Aringodar.\n\nAromal is declared winner. As he retires to his resting place, Chandu follows him to tend to his injuries. Aromal blames Chandu of cheating, by treating the swords to make them brittle, and attacks him. Aromal kills himself in an accident by falling over a lamp. As people gather, Aromal breathes out his last words: \"Chandu betrayed us!\".\n\nThe ill-fated Chandu escapes the mob and finds the blacksmith, who informs that he was bribed by Kunji. Fighting his way through the entire contingent of guards, Chandu storms into Aringodar's household seeking Kunji. To add to his list of regrets, he finds Kunji has committed suicide by hanging herself. Chandu returns to Puthooram Veedu and is greeted by a raging Unniyarcha, who vows her sons will avenge her brother\u2019s death.\n\nYears later, Aromal Unni and Kannapan Unni (sons of Unniyarcha and Aromal Chekavar respectively) come to the kalari of Arangodar seeking revenge. Chandu explains to them the situation, hoping to avoid a duel. However, after being repeatedly challenge Chandu easily beats both, once again showing his mastery. Thinking they will leave before bloodshed is inevitable he attempts to retire his weapons. The two young warriors are in no mood to leave in defeat and insist on a duel to the death. Chandu plainly tells them about their mistakes in the duel and skillfully explains the possible strategies they have up their sleeve. Aromal Unni announces himself, \"I, son of Unniyarcha, will die or go back with your head.\" Chandu realises the madness in the youngsters and appears to relent to their provocations, turns his back to them as if to pray in preparation for the duel. But knowing that no one will ever be able to win against him, and reminded that Aromal is Kannappan Chekavar's grandson, he commits one final act of valour: Chandu stabs himself with his sword. \"You would have been my son,\" he tells Aromal Unni reminiscing bitterly on what could have been. He reaches out to the statue of his deity and dies. There ends life of a valiant but misunderstood man, the greatest warrior of his age.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n*[[Mammootty]] as [[Chandu Chekavar]]: A misunderstood hero belonging to a mercenary clan. The orphan boy, Chandu, a quick learner, earns the love and admiration of his uncle, while he is loathed by his cousin. Veteran actor [[Prem Nazir]] was originally considered for this role but since MT felt Mammootty's physique would better suit the character.<ref>K. T. C. Abdullah, P. M. Jayan.

T. Vasudevan Nair]], and starring [[Mammootty]], [[Balan K. Nair]], [[Suresh Gopi]], [[Madhavi (actress)|Madhavi]], [[Geetha (actress)|Geetha]] and [[Captain Raju]]. The film won four [[National Film Awards]] (1989) including [[National Film Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] (Mammootty), [[National Film Award for Best Screenplay|Best Screenplay]] (M. T. Vasudevan Nair), [[National Film Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]] and [[National Film Award for Best Costume Design|Best Costume Design]] ([[P. Krishnamoorthy]]) and six [[Kerala State Film Awards]].\n\n== Plot ==\nThe film is set in 16th-century northern Kerala. The plot unfolds at Puthooram, the house of great Kannappan Chekavar. Kannappan Chekavar adopts the son of his estranged sister when the boy loses both his parents and brings him to Puthooram to live and learn with his cousins. The orphan boy, Chandu, a quick learner, earns the love and admiration of his uncle, while he is loathed by his cousin [[Aromal Chekavar|Aromal]].\n\nAs they grow up Chandu is betrothed to Chekavar's daughter, [[Unniyarcha]]. Several events unfold where in Chandu finds himself being pushed to the corner by his cousin. He flees to the kalari under the guidance of Tulunadan expert and master Chekavar, Aringodar.\n\nChandu has to recount only losses in his life, as Aromal ensures his sister is not married to Chandu. He even deceives Chandu by usurping and marrying Kunjinooli (Chithra), who was in love with Chandu. The heartbroken Chandu moves ahead and continues to master the art of Kalari Payattu from Aringodar.\n\nOn wedding day of Aromal, Unniyarcha invites Chandu to her room. However Unniyarcha\u2019s husband, the eunuch Kunjiraman sees them. Unniyarcha, the clever vixen that she is, convinces her husband that Chandu broke into her room as she was awaiting the arrival of Kunjiraman. Chandu gets a sobriquet: 'Womanizer Chandu.' A dejected Chandu finds solace in Kunji, Aringodar\u2019s daughter.\n\nFeudal lord Unnichandror (Ramu) arrives at the footsteps of Aringodar and invites him to represent his cause in an angam (duel unto death) against mooppu feud with his brother Unnikonar. Unnikonar, in turn, invites Aromal to represent him. Chandu is now caught in a dilemma, when his uncle requests him to play second hand to Aromal in the angam against his teacher Aringodar. Unniyarcha also appears and offers to live with Chandu if he assists Aromal to win against Aringodar. A tempted Chandu, decides to second Aromal. Chandu takes on the task of revitalizing Aromal's swords by providing them for treatment to the blacksmith. However, Kunji, Aringodar\u2019s daughter, bribes the blacksmith and makes them brittle.\n\nOn the day of the duel, Aromal, though highly skilled, is no match for the master Aringodar. To add to the misery, Aromal's sword breaks in two. As Chandu placates an attacking Aringodar, seeking time to replace the weapon, Aringodar obliges. Then wily Aromal throws his broken sword and kills an unguarded Aringodar.\n\nAromal is declared winner. As he retires to his resting place, Chandu follows him to tend to his injuries. Aromal blames Chandu of cheating, by treating the swords to make them brittle, and attacks him. Aromal kills himself in an accident by falling over a lamp. As people gather, Aromal breathes out his last words: \"Chandu betrayed us!\".\n\nThe ill-fated Chandu escapes the mob and finds the blacksmith, who informs that he was bribed by Kunji. Fighting his way through the entire contingent of guards, Chandu storms into Aringodar's household seeking Kunji. To add to his list of regrets, he finds Kunji has committed suicide by hanging herself. Chandu returns to Puthooram Veedu and is greeted by a raging Unniyarcha, who vows her sons will avenge her brother\u2019s death.\n\nYears later, Aromal Unni and Kannapan Unni (sons of Unniyarcha and Aromal Chekavar respectively) come to the kalari of Arangodar seeking revenge. Chandu explains to them the situation, hoping to avoid a duel. However, after being repeatedly challenge Chandu easily beats both, once again showing his mastery. Thinking they will leave before bloodshed is inevitable he attempts to retire his weapons. The two young warriors are in no mood to leave in defeat and insist on a duel to the death. Chandu plainly tells them about their mistakes in the duel and skillfully explains the possible strategies they have up their sleeve. Aromal Unni announces himself, \"I, son of Unniyarcha, will die or go back with your head.\" Chandu realises the madness in the youngsters and appears to relent to their provocations, turns his back to them as if to pray in preparation for the duel. But knowing that no one will ever be able to win against him, and reminded that Aromal is Kannappan Chekavar's grandson, he commits one final act of valour: Chandu stabs himself with his sword. \"You would have been my son,\" he tells Aromal Unni reminiscing bitterly on what could have been. He reaches out to the statue of his deity and dies. There ends life of a valiant but misunderstood man, the greatest warrior of his age.\n\n== Cast ==\n\n*[[Mammootty]] as [[Chandu Chekavar]]: A misunderstood hero belonging to a mercenary clan. The orphan boy, Chandu, a quick learner, earns the love and admiration of his uncle, while he is loathed by his cousin.

M. |last=McFarland |date=March 10, 2015 |website=[[Boing Boing]] |access-date=October 12, 2019}}</ref> played by [[Jonathan Banks]]. Mike is a former [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] police officer who works for [[Gus Fring|Gus]]\u2014and, on occasion, [[Saul Goodman|Saul]]\u2014as a private investigator, head of security, [[Fixer (person)|cleaner]], and [[hitman]]. His reasons for leaving the force in Philadelphia are never specified during the ''Breaking Bad'' series, but are detailed in ''Better Call Saul''. In 2019, he briefly appeared in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', a film directed and written by Vince Gilligan, made by Netflix and a continuation of the original show. In 2019, he became the first character to appear in ''Breaking Bad'', ''Better Call Saul'', and ''El Camino'' and is one of only two characters to have appeared in all three, the other being [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Associates of Saul Goodman#Ed Galbraith|Ed Galbraith]].\n\n==Creation==\nThe writers of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created the character of Mike Ehrmantraut as a substitute for [[Saul Goodman]], when actor [[Bob Odenkirk]] was unavailable for the last of four planned ''Breaking Bad'' episodes of [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|the second season]] because of a commitment to appear in ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''.<ref name=\"hiatt20150316\">{{Cite magazine |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |last2=Hiatt |first2=Brian |date=2015-03-16 |title=Bob Odenkirk on ''Saul'' and ''Mr. Show''{{'s}} Non-Reunion |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/bob-odenkirk-on-better-call-saul-and-the-mr-show-non-reunion-96299/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> They cast Jonathan Banks because they admired his work in the 1980s police drama ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''. Banks himself thought he would come on and do the role for the second season finale \"[[ABQ (Breaking Bad)|ABQ]]\", but had been impressed by working alongside [[Aaron Paul]] in that scene, and with the overall direction that [[Vince Gilligan]] had given for the episode once it aired. Banks considered his character close to that of [[Max Von Sydow]]'s Joubert from ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'', an assassin that painted figurines on the side.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://tv.avclub.com/jonathan-banks-1798227722 | title = Jonathan Banks | first = Will | last = Harris | date = November 5, 2011 | accessdate = March 5, 2020 | work = [[The A.V.

He subsequently became an officer on the Philadelphia police force. Mike had one son, Matt, who also became a police officer. Matt married Stacey and they had a daughter, Kaylee. In an extended flashback in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode, \"[[Five-O (Better Call Saul)|Five-O]]\", Mike is revealed as a crooked cop who took bribes. Matt was approached by other corrupt officers and asked Mike for advice; Mike advised Matt that not taking the money would label him a [[whistleblower]], and endanger his life and family, so Matt took it. Matt's partner and another officer killed Matt because his hesitation caused them to think he might turn them in. Stacey and Kaylee left Philadelphia for Albuquerque after Matt's funeral. Mike identified the officers who killed Matt and arranged a similar ambush to kill both of them, after which he left for Albuquerque, allowing him to see Stacey and Kaylee.\n\n===''Better Call Saul''===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nMike works as a parking lot attendant at the courthouse. In his off-hours he engages in security and \"muscle\" jobs to help support Stacey and Kaylee. Jimmy frequently deals with Mike when leaving the parking lot, irritated with Mike's demands for payment or the right number of validation stickers.\n\nPhiladelphia officers involved in the investigation of two murdered cops interrogate Mike, who hires Jimmy to represent him. Mike has Jimmy create a diversion, enabling Mike to steal one detective's notepad to learn what they know. He finds that Stacey contacted them after finding money hidden in the lining of one of her suitcases. Mike admits to her that he was involved in corruption in Philadelphia, and confesses that he \"broke\" his son Matt by persuading him to go along. Matt's partner and another cop killed him for fear he would report them, so Mike retaliated by killing the two of them, then moving to Albuquerque to be near his daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Stacey accepts Mike's explanation and consoles him. The detectives have no solid evidence, and leave for Philadelphia without bringing charges. Mike aids Jimmy in proving the Kettlemans staged their own disappearance, then helps Jimmy recover and return the money the Kettlemans embezzled.\n\nOn one of his \"muscle\" jobs, Mike is employed by Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\") to protect him during a drug deal with [[Nacho Varga]]. Mike has no weapon, but remains calm and controlled. When the payment is $20 short, Mike insists that Nacho pay Pryce full. After the deal is complete, Mike explains that he investigated Nacho beforehand and determined he was operating without the knowledge of his bosses in the Salamanca drug cartel, giving him an incentive to ensure that the transaction went smoothly.\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nImpressed by Mike's work for Pryce, Nacho approaches him with a request to kill his boss [[Tuco Salamanca]], Hector's nephew. Nacho fears Tuco may learn about his outside drug deals, and that his erratic behavior will draw unwanted police attention to the Salamanca drug business. Rather than kill Tuco, Mike engineers a public altercation so that Tuco is sentenced to prison for assault. Hector convinces Mike to say that the gun Tuco was carrying was his to reduce Tuco's sentence, but Mike suspects Hector knows the truth.\n\nFearing Hector may exact revenge on Stacey and Kaylee, Mike attempts to disrupt Hector's drug trade by hijacking a Salamanca truck and stealing the $250,000 it carries, but allowing the driver to live. He intended for a \"Good Samaritan\" to free the driver, but learns from Nacho that when someone did stop to help, the truck driver called Hector first, and Hector's crew cleaned up the scene and killed the Good Samaritan.\n\nMike decides to kill Hector and procures a black market sniper rifle. As he prepares to fire at Hector, he is suddenly interrupted by the horn of a car.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike finds his moves have been tracked by [[Gus Fring]], the owner of the Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant chain, which is part of the cartel's drug trafficking chain. Gus meets with Mike and explains that he does not want Hector dead until the time is right. He encourages Mike to continue to disrupt Hector's drug trafficking and attempts to pay him, but Mike does not accept the money. He asks for help to launder the $250,000 he stole, and Gus obliges by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive, the parent company to Los Pollos and a participant in its drug activities, to hire Mike as a contracted security consultant and pay him monthly consulting fees. Mike joins Stacey at group therapy sessions to help her overcome Matt's death.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nMike quits work at the parking lot and conducts actual security consulting at Madrigal. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] informs him the consulting contract was supposed to be a paper transaction, but Mike argues that his inspections provide plausible cover if anyone questions the payments. When Lydia complains to Gus, he tacitly approves of Mike's actions. At the group therapy sessions, Mike confronts another attendee over his lies, which causes a temporary rift between Stacey and Mike.\n\nConflict between the Salamancas and Gus's organization lead to Hector Salamanca suffering a stroke, and Gus discreetly pays for his recovery to the point where he recovers his mental faculties and can move his right finger. Gus initiates plans for a meth lab to be built under an industrial laundry, which is part of his plan to end reliance on cartel cocaine smuggled from Mexico. Mike arranges for structural engineers to secretly visit and assess the site while Gus silently observes. Gus selects Werner Ziegler to oversee construction of the lab, and Mike arranges for living quarters for Werner and his men during the months-long project. Mike takes to Werner, and tries to cover for him to Gus when Werner inadvertently reveals minimal details of the lab's construction to patrons at a local bar. When construction falls behind schedule, a homesick Werner escapes, intending to meet his wife at a nearby spa. Mike catches up to Werner and realizes that he has inadvertently revealed the existence of a construction project to Hector's nephew [[Lalo Salamanca]], who has arrived to take over management of the Salamanca drug business. Gus orders Werner's death, and offers to send someone to do it, but Mike executes Werner himself.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nWerner's death forces Gus to halt construction of the lab. Mike pays Werner's men in full for the half-completed job and sends them home. Gus presents a cover story to Lalo and Juan Bolsa, claiming Werner was working on a chilling system for the chicken farm, stole cocaine, and fled, after which Mike tracked him down and killed him. The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, and Lalo and Juan accept Gus's explanation and apology, but Lalo remains suspicious. Mike reacts with disgust at Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner and refuses to accept Gus's offer to continue paying him during the construction delay. Mike continues to struggle with Werner's death and drinks to excess. He becomes alienated from his family when he loses his temper with Kaylee, which leads Stacey to ask Mike to keep his distance. \n\nA gang with whom Mike had a previous altercation beats and stabs him. He awakens at a ranch just inside the Mexico border, which has ties to Gus including a fountain dedicated to Max, where his wounds have been treated by [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]]. He attempts to leave, but in his weakened state Dr. Goodman easily catches up. The doctor re-bandages Mike's wounds and recommends that he stay to recuperate. Mike calls Gus to ask what he intends, but Gus hangs up on him. Gus subsequently arrives to speak with Mike in person and asks for his help. Mike refuses to be Gus's \"[[contract killing|button man]]\", killing only to further Gus's vendetta against the Salamancas. Gus tells Mike he wants Mike with him because Mike understands Gus's need for revenge. After Mike returns to Albuquerque, Gus puts him in charge of dealing with Nacho and his inside information on the Salamancas. Mike secretly points police to Lalo's car and its ties to the murder of the money wire clerk. After Nacho tips him off to Lalo's location, Mike uses a police radio to pretend to be an officer making a check on Lalo's license plate, which causes police to converge on Lalo's location while he is driving and detain him.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is over the recent events that angered him, saying he moved past them by deciding to play the cards he was dealt. Lalo is arrested under an assumed name and remanded. Nacho tells Mike that Lalo wants Nacho to burn Los Pollos Hermanos. Nacho and Gus destroy the interior of one of Gus's restaurants then Gus sets an explosion that burns it down. Gus wants Lalo released, so Mike gives Jimmy details about the work he did to investigate to Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling Jimmy to win a motion for Lalo be released on bail.\n\nThe Cousins pick up Lalo's bail money in Mexico and deliver it to Jimmy at a remote pickup site. An informant makes a telephone call to report their activities. As Jimmy begins his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen, who take the cash and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked and killed, but one escapes. The shooter is revealed to be Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. Mike puts the cash and Jimmy back in Jimmy's car and they begin the drive to Albuquerque, but begin to walk cross-country after the car breaks down. They camp overnight and resume their trek the next morning. When they see the surviving gunman is still searching for them, Jimmy attracts his attention and draws him closer so Mike can shoot him. The gunman's vehicle flips and is destroyed, and the gunman is killed. Mike and Jimmy resume walking.\n\n===''Breaking Bad''===\nBy time of ''Breaking Bad'', Mike still works for Gus, and does occasional work for Jimmy, who continues practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] allows [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane]] to die from a heroin overdose, Saul dispatches Mike to clean [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]'s apartment. Mike removes all traces of the drugs and provides Jesse advice that enables him to avoid incriminating himself when speaking to police after Mike leaves. When Jesse later goes missing Mike tracks him down and drives Walt to the location.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWith Walt and [[Skyler White]] in the middle of a divorce, Saul has Mike spy on Skyler. Mike sees Walt arrive home, followed soon after by Tuco's cousins, who intend to kill Walt in retaliation for Tuco's death. Mike has Gus call off the cousins, since Walt is central to Gus's meth making scheme, and convinces them to target Hank, the DEA agent who shot Tuco. Gus then anonymously warns Hank, who is able to fight back. He survives the attack and kills one cousin, and Mike kills the other in the hospital.\n\nThe cartel disrupts Gus' meth distribution and he has Mike investigate. Mike kills the four cartel operatives sent to harass Duane Chow, one of Gus' chemical suppliers. He later hides in one of the Los Pollos Hermanos trucks during a drug run so he can learn the cartel's tactics and implement countermeasures that protect future drug shipments.\n\nWhile Walt and Jesse have been cooking meth in the underground superlab, Jesse has become more unstable. He learns that two of Gus's local drug dealers were responsible for the death of his friend Combo and Tom\u00e1s, the younger brother of Jesse's girlfriend Andrea. Knowing Jesse intends to kill the dealers, Walt acts first and runs them down with his car, then tells Jesse to flee.  Gus keeps Walt on, but requires that he work with [[Gale Boetticher|Gale]] again. Walt correctly fears that once Gale knows enough to take over, Gus will have Walt and Jesse killed.  Walt tricks Mike into looking for Jesse in the wrong place, giving Walt time to meet Jesse and tell him to find Gale's address. Mike later escorts Walt back to the lab on the pretense of responding to a chemical spill, but Walt knows Mike is supposed to kill him. Intending to kill Jesse too, Mike instructs Walt to call Jesse and persuade him to come to the lab.  Instead, Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale so that Gus will have to keep them alive to continue meth production.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nJesse kills Gale. Victor arrives soon after and brings Jesse back to the lab. Mike and Victor keep watch over Jesse and Walt while waiting for Gus. Knowing he was recognized at Gale's house, and hoping to demonstrate that he can still be useful to Gus, Victor begins producing a batch of meth, revealing that he has learned the process by watching Walt and Jesse. Gus arrives, kills Victor in front of Walt and Jesse, then tells them to get back to work. Mike increases security at the lab, including installing video cameras and personally standing watch over Walt and Jesse while they work.\n\nMike informs Gus they may be able to drive Walter and Jesse apart. Gus agrees, and Mike takes Jesse with him on dead-drop retrievals and other tasks. Jesse foils a prearranged attack on Mike, boosting his confidence and increasing his loyalty to Mike and Gus. After another Los Pollos Hermanos truck is robbed and the meth stolen, Jesse aids Mike in retrieving it. His competence convinces Mike and Gus to continue making use of Jesse, and he goes to Mexico with them for a meeting between Gus and the cartel leaders that is intended to end their dispute. Jesse produces a superior batch of meth on his own, and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico to produce it for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse. During a party at [[Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]]'s house to celebrate the rapprochement, Gus uses a poisoned bottle of tequila to kill most of the cartel leaders, including taking the first drink himself to alleviate suspicion. Mike is shot helping Gus escape, and Jesse helps both the ill Gus and injured Mike make their way to pre-planned medical treatment. For the doctor Gus has hired, Mike's wounds are secondary to Gus\u2018s illness, and after Gus recovers, Mike remains in Mexico for several weeks while Gus and Jesse return to Albuquerque. While Mike is recovering, Walt engineers Gus\u2018s death, after which he and Jesse destroy the meth lab.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nMike learns of Gus's death, blames Walt, and intends to kill him. As Mike drives back to Albuquerque, he encounters Walt and Jesse, who explain why they killed Gus. They remind him that the security camera footage from the lab can implicate both Mike and them, and ask for his aid in destroying it.  Mike tells them the recordings were stored on Gus's laptop, which is now in police custody.  He aids Walt and Jesse to build and employ an [[electromagnet]] that wipes the laptop's data. This inadvertently leads the police to discover, elsewhere in Gus's possessions, hidden account numbers and access codes for the money Gus deposited offshore to be used to pay the members of his organization for their silence.  They seize the accounts, making it likely that Gus's former employees will reveal Mike, Jesse, and Walt to the police.\n\nMike joins Walt and Jesse in a new organization, with Jesse and Walt producing meth in a mobile lab operated inside the tented homes of a fumigation company's customers.  When Lydia suspects the DEA is tracking the methylamine Madrigal supplies, she provides Mike, Walt and Jesse with information on a train that includes a tanker car of methylamine. They arrange to steal a large quantity without detection, but Todd, an employee of the fumigation company who aids in the robbery, shoots and kills a young boy who witnessed it. Wanting no part of this type of brutality, Mike and Jesse sell their share of the methylamine to Declan, a drug dealer from Phoenix, while Walt produces the meth Declan distributes.  Mike agrees to continue paying Gus's former employees from his share of the methylamine sale in order to ensure their continued silence.\n\nThe DEA identifies Mike's connection to Gus, but he removes evidence from his home and hides getaway money in a \"go bag\" at the airport, so a police search of his home turns up nothing.  The police identify the attorney Mike has been using to make the payments to Gus's former employees, then locate the money he has been saving for Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike, intending to flee, asks Saul to retrieve his go bag.  Walt retrieves it instead, and meets with Mike. He demands the names of Mike's associates in exchange, so he can have them killed in prison to protect his identity. Mike refuses, and Walt shoots him with the gun from the go bag.  After following a mortally wounded Mike to the edge of a river, Walt comes to the realization that he could have simply asked Lydia for the names. Walt begins to apologize, but Mike stops him, saying \"let me die in peace.\"<ref>{{cite web |last=Molloy |first=Tim |title=\"Breaking Bad\" star Jonathan Banks: \"The bad guy's gotta die\" |url=https://news.yahoo.com/breaking-bad-star-jonathan-banks-bad-guys-gotta-201325777.html |website=Yahoo!

In a discussion that takes place shortly before Mike and Jesse leave Walt's meth business, Jesse asks Mike where he would go if he could start over.  Mike says if he was younger, he would go to [[Alaska]], an idea Jesse finds appealing.  Jesse expresses a desire to make amends for past wrongdoing, but Mike cautions that starting over will make it impossible.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://etcanada.com/video/f73606ac-dd83-11e9-bfeb-5a25fcbd3cd5/jonathan-banks-confirms-el-camino-role/ |title=Jonathan Banks Confirms 'El Camino' Role |website=[[ET Canada]] |date=September 22, 2019 |access-date=September 23, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n[[File:Jonathan Banks 2012 2.jpg|thumb|[[Jonathan Banks]] portrays Mike Ehrmantraut in both ''Breaking Bad'' and ''Better Call Saul'']]\nThe ''Breaking Bad'' [[Breaking Bad (season 5)|fifth season]] episode \"[[Say My Name (Breaking Bad)|Say My Name]]\" received critical acclaim, with many critics singling out Jonathan Banks and [[Bryan Cranston]] for particular praise.

Mike is a former [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] police officer who works for [[Gus Fring|Gus]]\u2014and, on occasion, [[Saul Goodman|Saul]]\u2014as a private investigator, head of security, [[Fixer (person)|cleaner]], and [[hitman]]. His reasons for leaving the force in Philadelphia are never specified during the ''Breaking Bad'' series, but are detailed in ''Better Call Saul''. In 2019, he briefly appeared in ''[[El Camino: A Breaking Bad Movie]]'', a film directed and written by Vince Gilligan, made by Netflix and a continuation of the original show. In 2019, he became the first character to appear in ''Breaking Bad'', ''Better Call Saul'', and ''El Camino'' and is one of only two characters to have appeared in all three, the other being [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Associates of Saul Goodman#Ed Galbraith|Ed Galbraith]].\n\n==Creation==\nThe writers of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' created the character of Mike Ehrmantraut as a substitute for [[Saul Goodman]], when actor [[Bob Odenkirk]] was unavailable for the last of four planned ''Breaking Bad'' episodes of [[Breaking Bad (season 2)|the second season]] because of a commitment to appear in ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]''.<ref name=\"hiatt20150316\">{{Cite magazine |last=Hiatt |first=Brian |last2=Hiatt |first2=Brian |date=2015-03-16 |title=Bob Odenkirk on ''Saul'' and ''Mr. Show''{{'s}} Non-Reunion |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/tv/tv-news/bob-odenkirk-on-better-call-saul-and-the-mr-show-non-reunion-96299/ |magazine=Rolling Stone |language=en-US}}</ref> They cast Jonathan Banks because they admired his work in the 1980s police drama ''[[Wiseguy (TV series)|Wiseguy]]''. Banks himself thought he would come on and do the role for the second season finale \"[[ABQ (Breaking Bad)|ABQ]]\", but had been impressed by working alongside [[Aaron Paul]] in that scene, and with the overall direction that [[Vince Gilligan]] had given for the episode once it aired. Banks considered his character close to that of [[Max Von Sydow]]'s Joubert from ''[[Three Days of the Condor]]'', an assassin that painted figurines on the side.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://tv.avclub.com/jonathan-banks-1798227722 | title = Jonathan Banks | first = Will | last = Harris | date = November 5, 2011 | accessdate = March 5, 2020 | work = [[The A.V.

He subsequently became an officer on the Philadelphia police force. Mike had one son, Matt, who also became a police officer. Matt married Stacey and they had a daughter, Kaylee. In an extended flashback in the ''Better Call Saul'' episode, \"[[Five-O (Better Call Saul)|Five-O]]\", Mike is revealed as a crooked cop who took bribes. Matt was approached by other corrupt officers and asked Mike for advice; Mike advised Matt that not taking the money would label him a [[whistleblower]], and endanger his life and family, so Matt took it. Matt's partner and another officer killed Matt because his hesitation caused them to think he might turn them in. Stacey and Kaylee left Philadelphia for Albuquerque after Matt's funeral. Mike identified the officers who killed Matt and arranged a similar ambush to kill both of them, after which he left for Albuquerque, allowing him to see Stacey and Kaylee.\n\n===''Better Call Saul''===\n====Season 1====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 1)}}\nMike works as a parking lot attendant at the courthouse. In his off-hours he engages in security and \"muscle\" jobs to help support Stacey and Kaylee. Jimmy frequently deals with Mike when leaving the parking lot, irritated with Mike's demands for payment or the right number of validation stickers.\n\nPhiladelphia officers involved in the investigation of two murdered cops interrogate Mike, who hires Jimmy to represent him. Mike has Jimmy create a diversion, enabling Mike to steal one detective's notepad to learn what they know. He finds that Stacey contacted them after finding money hidden in the lining of one of her suitcases. Mike admits to her that he was involved in corruption in Philadelphia, and confesses that he \"broke\" his son Matt by persuading him to go along. Matt's partner and another cop killed him for fear he would report them, so Mike retaliated by killing the two of them, then moving to Albuquerque to be near his daughter-in-law and granddaughter. Stacey accepts Mike's explanation and consoles him. The detectives have no solid evidence, and leave for Philadelphia without bringing charges. Mike aids Jimmy in proving the Kettlemans staged their own disappearance, then helps Jimmy recover and return the money the Kettlemans embezzled.\n\nOn one of his \"muscle\" jobs, Mike is employed by Daniel Wormald (\"Pryce\") to protect him during a drug deal with [[Nacho Varga]]. Mike has no weapon, but remains calm and controlled. When the payment is $20 short, Mike insists that Nacho pay Pryce full. After the deal is complete, Mike explains that he investigated Nacho beforehand and determined he was operating without the knowledge of his bosses in the Salamanca drug cartel, giving him an incentive to ensure that the transaction went smoothly.\n\n====Season 2====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 2)}}\nImpressed by Mike's work for Pryce, Nacho approaches him with a request to kill his boss [[Tuco Salamanca]], Hector's nephew. Nacho fears Tuco may learn about his outside drug deals, and that his erratic behavior will draw unwanted police attention to the Salamanca drug business. Rather than kill Tuco, Mike engineers a public altercation so that Tuco is sentenced to prison for assault. Hector convinces Mike to say that the gun Tuco was carrying was his to reduce Tuco's sentence, but Mike suspects Hector knows the truth.\n\nFearing Hector may exact revenge on Stacey and Kaylee, Mike attempts to disrupt Hector's drug trade by hijacking a Salamanca truck and stealing the $250,000 it carries, but allowing the driver to live. He intended for a \"Good Samaritan\" to free the driver, but learns from Nacho that when someone did stop to help, the truck driver called Hector first, and Hector's crew cleaned up the scene and killed the Good Samaritan.\n\nMike decides to kill Hector and procures a black market sniper rifle. As he prepares to fire at Hector, he is suddenly interrupted by the horn of a car.\n\n====Season 3====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 3)}}\nMike finds his moves have been tracked by [[Gus Fring]], the owner of the Los Pollos Hermanos restaurant chain, which is part of the cartel's drug trafficking chain. Gus meets with Mike and explains that he does not want Hector dead until the time is right. He encourages Mike to continue to disrupt Hector's drug trafficking and attempts to pay him, but Mike does not accept the money. He asks for help to launder the $250,000 he stole, and Gus obliges by arranging for Madrigal Electromotive, the parent company to Los Pollos and a participant in its drug activities, to hire Mike as a contracted security consultant and pay him monthly consulting fees. Mike joins Stacey at group therapy sessions to help her overcome Matt's death.\n\n====Season 4====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 4)}}\nMike quits work at the parking lot and conducts actual security consulting at Madrigal. [[Lydia Rodarte-Quayle]] informs him the consulting contract was supposed to be a paper transaction, but Mike argues that his inspections provide plausible cover if anyone questions the payments. When Lydia complains to Gus, he tacitly approves of Mike's actions. At the group therapy sessions, Mike confronts another attendee over his lies, which causes a temporary rift between Stacey and Mike.\n\nConflict between the Salamancas and Gus's organization lead to Hector Salamanca suffering a stroke, and Gus discreetly pays for his recovery to the point where he recovers his mental faculties and can move his right finger. Gus initiates plans for a meth lab to be built under an industrial laundry, which is part of his plan to end reliance on cartel cocaine smuggled from Mexico. Mike arranges for structural engineers to secretly visit and assess the site while Gus silently observes. Gus selects Werner Ziegler to oversee construction of the lab, and Mike arranges for living quarters for Werner and his men during the months-long project. Mike takes to Werner, and tries to cover for him to Gus when Werner inadvertently reveals minimal details of the lab's construction to patrons at a local bar. When construction falls behind schedule, a homesick Werner escapes, intending to meet his wife at a nearby spa. Mike catches up to Werner and realizes that he has inadvertently revealed the existence of a construction project to Hector's nephew [[Lalo Salamanca]], who has arrived to take over management of the Salamanca drug business. Gus orders Werner's death, and offers to send someone to do it, but Mike executes Werner himself.\n\n====Season 5====\n{{see also|Better Call Saul (season 5)}}\nWerner's death forces Gus to halt construction of the lab. Mike pays Werner's men in full for the half-completed job and sends them home. Gus presents a cover story to Lalo and Juan Bolsa, claiming Werner was working on a chilling system for the chicken farm, stole cocaine, and fled, after which Mike tracked him down and killed him. The story explains events of which Lalo is aware, and Lalo and Juan accept Gus's explanation and apology, but Lalo remains suspicious. Mike reacts with disgust at Gus's seeming lack of compassion for Werner and refuses to accept Gus's offer to continue paying him during the construction delay. Mike continues to struggle with Werner's death and drinks to excess. He becomes alienated from his family when he loses his temper with Kaylee, which leads Stacey to ask Mike to keep his distance. \n\nA gang with whom Mike had a previous altercation beats and stabs him. He awakens at a ranch just inside the Mexico border, which has ties to Gus including a fountain dedicated to Max, where his wounds have been treated by [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Barry Goodman|Dr. Barry Goodman]]. He attempts to leave, but in his weakened state Dr. Goodman easily catches up. The doctor re-bandages Mike's wounds and recommends that he stay to recuperate. Mike calls Gus to ask what he intends, but Gus hangs up on him. Gus subsequently arrives to speak with Mike in person and asks for his help. Mike refuses to be Gus's \"[[contract killing|button man]]\", killing only to further Gus's vendetta against the Salamancas. Gus tells Mike he wants Mike with him because Mike understands Gus's need for revenge. After Mike returns to Albuquerque, Gus puts him in charge of dealing with Nacho and his inside information on the Salamancas. Mike secretly points police to Lalo's car and its ties to the murder of the money wire clerk. After Nacho tips him off to Lalo's location, Mike uses a police radio to pretend to be an officer making a check on Lalo's license plate, which causes police to converge on Lalo's location while he is driving and detain him.\n\nMike spends time with Kaylee and tells Stacey he is over the recent events that angered him, saying he moved past them by deciding to play the cards he was dealt. Lalo is arrested under an assumed name and remanded. Nacho tells Mike that Lalo wants Nacho to burn Los Pollos Hermanos. Nacho and Gus destroy the interior of one of Gus's restaurants then Gus sets an explosion that burns it down. Gus wants Lalo released, so Mike gives Jimmy details about the work he did to investigate to Lalo. Jimmy uses the information to accuse police of witness tampering, enabling Jimmy to win a motion for Lalo be released on bail.\n\nThe Cousins pick up Lalo's bail money in Mexico and deliver it to Jimmy at a remote pickup site. An informant reports activities of The Cousins, and as Jimmy begins his return trip, he is cut off by several gunmen, who take the cash and prepare to kill him. The gunmen are suddenly attacked and killed, but one escapes. The shooter is revealed to be Mike, who was tracking Jimmy's movements for Gus. Mike puts the cash and Jimmy back in Jimmy's car and they begin the drive to Albuquerque, but begin to walk cross-country after the car breaks down. They camp overnight and resume their trek the next morning. When they see the surviving gunman is still searching for them, Jimmy attracts his attention and draws him so Mike can shoot him. The gunman's vehicle flips and is destroyed, and Mike and Jimmy resume walking.\n\n===''Breaking Bad''===\nBy time of ''Breaking Bad'', Mike still works for Gus, and does occasional work for Jimmy, who continues practicing law under the name Saul Goodman.\n\n==== Season 2 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 2)}}\nAfter [[Walter White (Breaking Bad)|Walt]] allows [[List of Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul characters#Jane Margolis|Jane]] to die from a heroin overdose, Saul dispatches Mike to clean [[Jesse Pinkman|Jesse]]'s apartment. Mike removes all traces of the drugs and provides Jesse advice that enables him to avoid incriminating himself when speaking to police after Mike leaves. When Jesse later goes missing Mike tracks him down and drives Walt to the location.\n\n==== Season 3 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 3)}}\nWith Walt and [[Skyler White]] in the middle of a divorce, Saul has Mike spy on Skyler. Mike sees Walt arrive home, followed soon after by Tuco's cousins, who intend to kill Walt in retaliation for Tuco's death. Mike has Gus call off the cousins, since Walt is central to Gus's meth making scheme, and convinces them to target Hank, the DEA agent who shot Tuco. Gus then anonymously warns Hank, who is able to fight back. He survives the attack and kills one cousin, and Mike kills the other in the hospital.\n\nThe cartel disrupts Gus' meth distribution and he has Mike investigate. Mike kills the four cartel operatives sent to harass Duane Chow, one of Gus' chemical suppliers. He later hides in one of the Los Pollos Hermanos trucks during a drug run so he can learn the cartel's tactics and implement countermeasures that protect future drug shipments.\n\nWhile Walt and Jesse have been cooking meth in the underground superlab, Jesse has become more unstable. He learns that two of Gus's local drug dealers were responsible for the death of his friend Combo and Tom\u00e1s, the younger brother of Jesse's girlfriend Andrea. Knowing Jesse intends to kill the dealers, Walt acts first and runs them down with his car, then tells Jesse to flee.  Gus keeps Walt on, but requires that he work with [[Gale Boetticher|Gale]] again. Walt correctly fears that once Gale knows enough to take over, Gus will have Walt and Jesse killed.  Walt tricks Mike into looking for Jesse in the wrong place, giving Walt time to meet Jesse and tell him to find Gale's address. Mike later escorts Walt back to the lab on the pretense of responding to a chemical spill, but Walt knows Mike is supposed to kill him. Intending to kill Jesse too, Mike instructs Walt to call Jesse and persuade him to come to the lab.  Instead, Walt tells Jesse to kill Gale so that Gus will have to keep them alive to continue meth production.\n\n==== Season 4 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 4)}}\nJesse kills Gale. Victor arrives soon after and brings Jesse back to the lab. Mike and Victor keep watch over Jesse and Walt while waiting for Gus. Knowing he was recognized at Gale's house, and hoping to demonstrate that he can still be useful to Gus, Victor begins producing a batch of meth, revealing that he has learned the process by watching Walt and Jesse. Gus arrives, kills Victor in front of Walt and Jesse, then tells them to get back to work. Mike increases security at the lab, including installing video cameras and personally standing watch over Walt and Jesse while they work.\n\nMike informs Gus they may be able to drive Walter and Jesse apart. Gus agrees, and Mike takes Jesse with him on dead-drop retrievals and other tasks. Jesse foils a prearranged attack on Mike, boosting his confidence and increasing his loyalty to Mike and Gus. After another Los Pollos Hermanos truck is robbed and the meth stolen, Jesse aids Mike in retrieving it. His competence convinces Mike and Gus to continue making use of Jesse, and he goes to Mexico with them for a meeting between Gus and the cartel leaders that is intended to end their dispute. Jesse produces a superior batch of meth on his own, and Gus offers to have him stay in Mexico to produce it for the cartel.  Jesse is apprehensive, but the offer is a ruse. During a party at [[Don Eladio Vuente|Don Eladio]]'s house to celebrate the rapprochement, Gus uses a poisoned bottle of tequila to kill most of the cartel leaders, including taking the first drink himself to alleviate suspicion. Mike is shot helping Gus escape, and Jesse helps both the ill Gus and injured Mike make their way to pre-planned medical treatment. For the doctor Gus has hired, Mike's wounds are secondary to Gus\u2018s illness, and after Gus recovers, Mike remains in Mexico for several weeks while Gus and Jesse return to Albuquerque. While Mike is recovering, Walt engineers Gus\u2018s death, after which he and Jesse destroy the meth lab.\n\n==== Season 5 ====\n{{see also|Breaking Bad (season 5)}}\nMike learns of Gus's death, blames Walt, and intends to kill him. As Mike drives back to Albuquerque, he encounters Walt and Jesse, who explain why they killed Gus. They remind him that the security camera footage from the lab can implicate both Mike and them, and ask for his aid in destroying it.  Mike tells them the recordings were stored on Gus's laptop, which is now in police custody.  He aids Walt and Jesse to build and employ an [[electromagnet]] that wipes the laptop's data. This inadvertently leads the police to discover, elsewhere in Gus's possessions, hidden account numbers and access codes for the money Gus deposited offshore to be used to pay the members of his organization for their silence.  They seize the accounts, making it likely that Gus's former employees will reveal Mike, Jesse, and Walt to the police.\n\nMike joins Walt and Jesse in a new organization, with Jesse and Walt producing meth in a mobile lab operated inside the tented homes of a fumigation company's customers.  When Lydia suspects the DEA is tracking the methylamine Madrigal supplies, she provides Mike, Walt and Jesse with information on a train that includes a tanker car of methylamine. They arrange to steal a large quantity without detection, but Todd, an employee of the fumigation company who aids in the robbery, shoots and kills a young boy who witnessed it. Wanting no part of this type of brutality, Mike and Jesse sell their share of the methylamine to Declan, a drug dealer from Phoenix, while Walt produces the meth Declan distributes.  Mike agrees to continue paying Gus's former employees from his share of the methylamine sale in order to ensure their continued silence.\n\nThe DEA identifies Mike's connection to Gus, but he removes evidence from his home and hides getaway money in a \"go bag\" at the airport, so a police search of his home turns up nothing.  The police identify the attorney Mike has been using to make the payments to Gus's former employees, then locate the money he has been saving for Stacey and Kaylee.  Mike, intending to flee, asks Saul to retrieve his go bag.  Walt retrieves it instead, and meets with Mike. He demands the names of Mike's associates in exchange, so he can have them killed in prison to protect his identity. Mike refuses, and Walt shoots him with the gun from the go bag.

The Post Office Act XIV introduced reforms by 1 May 1866 to correct some of the more obvious postal-system deficiencies and abuses. Postal-service efficiencies were also introduced. In 1863, lower rates were set for [[steamship|\"steamer\"]] mail to Europe at (six annas, eight pies for a {{1/2}}-ounce letter). Lower rates were also introduced for inland mail.\nNew regulations removed special postal privileges enjoyed by officials of the East India Company. Stamps for official use were prepared and carefully accounted for, to combat abuses by officials. In 1854 Spain had printed special stamps for official communications, but in 1866 India was the first country to adopt the expedient of [[overprint]]ing \"Service\" on postage stamps and \"Service Postage\" on revenue stamps. This innovation was later widely adopted by other countries.<ref name=\"Alan C. Campbell 1996\">Alan C.

Some \"Service Postage\" overprinted rarities resulted from abrupt changes in postal regulations. New designs for the four-anna and six-anna-eight-[[Indian pie|pie]] stamps were issued in 1866. Nevertheless, there was a shortage of stamps to meet the new rates. Provisional six-anna stamps were improvised by cutting the top and bottom from a current foreign-bill [[revenue stamp]] and overprinting \"Postage\".

Thereafter, the Indian Posts and Telegraph Department embarked on a broad-based policy for the issuance of stamps. On 21 November 1947 the first new stamp was issued by independent India. It depicts the [[Indian flag]] with the patriots' slogan, ''[[Jai Hind]]'' (\"long live India\"), at the top right-hand corner. The stamp was valued at three and one-half [[Indian anna|annas]]. A memorial to [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was issued 15 August 1948 on the first anniversary of independence. One year later a [[definitive series]] appeared, depicting India's broad cultural heritage (primarily [[Hindu]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Muslim]], [[Sikh]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] temples, sculptures, monuments and fortresses). A subsequent issue commemorated the beginning of the [[Republic of India]] on 26 January 1950. Definitives included a technology-and-development theme in 1955, a series depicting a map of India in 1957 (denominated in ''[[Paisa|naya paisa]]''\u2014decimal currency) and a 1965 series with a wide variety of images. The old inscription \"India Postage\" was replaced in 1962 with ''\"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 INDIA\"'', although three stamps (issued from December 1962 to January 1963) carried the earlier inscription.<ref>Saksena, V.

The Scinde stamps became known as \"[[Scinde Dawk]]s\"; \"Dawk\" is the Anglicised spelling of the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] word ''Dak'' or (\"post\"). These stamps, with a value of {{1/2}}-anna, were in use until June 1866. The first all-India stamps were issued on 1 October 1854.\n\n===Stamps issued by the East India Company===\n{{Multiple image\n|direction=vertical\n|image1=Money Order-Front.jpg\n|caption1=1955 money order (front)\n|image2=Money Order-Back 01.jpg\n|caption2=1955 money order (back)}}\nThe volume of mail moved by the postal system increased significantly, doubling between 1854 and 1866 and doubling again by 1871. The Post Office Act XIV introduced reforms by 1 May 1866 to correct some of the more obvious postal-system deficiencies and abuses. Postal-service efficiencies were also introduced. In 1863, lower rates were set for [[steamship|\"steamer\"]] mail to Europe at (six annas, eight pies for a {{1/2}}-ounce letter). Lower rates were also introduced for inland mail.\nNew regulations removed special postal privileges enjoyed by officials of the East India Company. Stamps for official use were prepared and carefully accounted for, to combat abuses by officials. In 1854 Spain had printed special stamps for official communications, but in 1866 India was the first country to adopt the expedient of [[overprint]]ing \"Service\" on postage stamps and \"Service Postage\" on revenue stamps. This innovation was later widely adopted by other countries.<ref name=\"Alan C. Campbell 1996\">Alan C.

Some \"Service Postage\" overprinted rarities resulted from abrupt changes in postal regulations. New designs for the four-anna and six-anna-eight-[[Indian pie|pie]] stamps were issued in 1866. Nevertheless, there was a shortage of stamps to meet the new rates. Provisional six-anna stamps were improvised by cutting the top and bottom from a current foreign-bill [[revenue stamp]] and overprinting \"Postage\".

Thereafter, the Indian Posts and Telegraph Department embarked on a broad-based policy for the issuance of stamps. On 21 November 1947 the first new stamp was issued by independent India. It depicts the [[Indian flag]] with the patriots' slogan, ''[[Jai Hind]]'' (\"long live India\"), at the top right-hand corner. The stamp was valued at three and one-half [[Indian anna|annas]]. A memorial to [[Mahatma Gandhi]] was issued 15 August 1948 on the first anniversary of independence. One year later a [[definitive series]] appeared, depicting India's broad cultural heritage (primarily [[Hindu]], [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], [[Muslim]], [[Sikh]] and [[Jainism|Jain]] temples, sculptures, monuments and fortresses). A subsequent issue commemorated the beginning of the [[Republic of India]] on 26 January 1950. Definitives included a technology-and-development theme in 1955, a series depicting a map of India in 1957 (denominated in ''[[Paisa|naya paisa]]''\u2014decimal currency) and a 1965 series with a wide variety of images. The old inscription \"India Postage\" was replaced in 1962 with ''\"\u092d\u093e\u0930\u0924 INDIA\"'', although three stamps (issued from December 1962 to January 1963) carried the earlier inscription.<ref>Saksena, V.
