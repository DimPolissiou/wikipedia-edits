With a population of 7,659 (as of 1 January 2019),<ref>[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1 January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref> it is the main town and the administrative seat of the [[T\u00f8nder Municipality]].\n\n==History==\nThe first mention of T\u00f8nder might have been in the mid-12th century, when the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] mentioned the landmark ''Tu(r)ndira'', which might have been a reference to either T\u00f8nder, or the nearby town of [[M\u00f8gelt\u00f8nder]].\n\nT\u00f8nder was granted port privileges by the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1243, making it Denmark's oldest privileged market town. In 1532 it was hit by severe floods, with water levels reaching 1.8 m in St Laurent's church, 5.3 m above [[sea level]]. In the 1550s, T\u00f8nder's port lost direct access to the sea due to [[Levee|dyke]]s being built to the west of town at the direction of Duke [[John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev|Hans the Elder of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev]], the son of [[Frederick I of Denmark]].\n\nThe town center is dominated by houses from the late 17th and early 18th century, when the town experienced rapid growth as a result of its [[T\u00f8nder lace|lace]] industry. Prior to 1864, T\u00f8nder was situated in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]], so its history is intertwined with the contentious [[history of Schleswig-Holstein]]. In the 1920s, when the [[Schleswig Plebiscite]] incorporated [[Northern Schleswig]] into Denmark, 76.5% of T\u00f8nder's inhabitants voted to remain part of Germany and 23.5% voted to join Denmark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/forum/kollektives_gedaechtnis/082/nachher.html|title=Nach der Volksabstimmung|language=German|publisher=[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204040129/http://www.dhm.de/lemo/forum/kollektives_gedaechtnis/082/nachher.html|archive-date=4 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], a [[Zeppelin]] base was operated in T\u00f8nder by the [[Imperial German Navy]]. The base was attacked by the British on 19 July 1918, in what is known as the [[Tondern raid]]. Seven [[Sopwith Camels]] from the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} bombed the base, hitting two of the three [[airship hangar]]s. The Zeppelins ''L.54'' and ''L.60'' inside one hangar were destroyed and a balloon inside the other was damaged. After this, T\u00f8nder was abandoned as an active airship base, and was used only as an emergency landing site. A wartime aircraft hangar survives, as do some of the ancillary buildings, but only the foundations remain of the large airship hangars. The site now houses a museum, named the Zeppelin and Garrison Museum T\u00f8nder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeppelin-museum.dk/main.php?page=base&lang=en |title=The Zeppelin base in T\u00f8nder |date= |work= |publisher=Zeppelin and Garrison Museum T\u00f8nder |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter the First World War, T\u00f8nder was detached from Germany in spite of the majority of its population casting a pro-German vote in the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] - as T\u00f8nder was included in Zone I, which as a whole had a strong pro-Danish majority.  In the years that followed, German political parties enjoyed a majority in the city council, and until 1945, the city was officially bilingual.\n\nAfter the end of the [[German occupation of Denmark]], the political influence of the German population dwindled considerably. In spite of the improvement in cross-border traffic, the location of the town continued to hamper industrial growth through the late 20th century, although some companies did set up businesses. Tourism has grown in importance. In 1989, T\u00f8nder Seminarium, the oldest teacher training college in Scandinavia, established in 1788, was closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-sonderjylland.dk/SIDERNE/Museerne/Bygningskulturen/03c04-Oestergade63.html|title=03c04-Oestergade63.html|website=Museum-sonderjylland.dk|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Tondern, Fussgaengerzone.jpg|thumb|Pedestrian street]]\nEvery August, the [[T\u00f8nder Festival]] offers visitors a wide variety of traditional and modern folk music. The Scouts of T\u00f8nder are twinned with [[Hemyock]], in Devon, England, and make exchange trips between the countries every few years.\n\n== Marriage ==\nAs T\u00f8nder is the first town over the border in Denmark from Germany, the town has been a particularly popular place to [[Marriage|elope]] since the 1960s. This is especially true for couples of mixed-nationalities, particularly between [[European citizens|Europeans citizens]] and non-European citizens.

With a population of 7,659 (as of 1 January 2019),<ref>[https://m.statbank.dk/TableInfo/BY3?lang=en BY3: Population 1 January, by urban areas] The Mobile Statbank from [[Statistics Denmark]]</ref> it is the main town and the administrative seat of the [[T\u00f8nder Municipality]].\n\n==History==\nThe first mention of T\u00f8nder might have been in the mid-12th century, when the Arab geographer [[Muhammad al-Idrisi]] mentioned the landmark ''Tu(r)ndira'', which might have been a reference to either T\u00f8nder, or the nearby town of [[M\u00f8gelt\u00f8nder]].\n\nT\u00f8nder was granted port privileges by the [[Hanseatic League]] in 1243, making it Denmark's oldest privileged market town. In 1532 it was hit by severe floods, with water levels reaching 1.8 m in St Laurent's church, 5.3 m above [[sea level]]. In the 1550s, T\u00f8nder's port lost direct access to the sea due to [[Levee|dyke]]s being built to the west of town at the direction of Duke [[John II, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev|Hans the Elder of Schleswig-Holstein-Haderslev]], the son of [[Frederick I of Denmark]].\n\nThe town center is dominated by houses from the late 17th and early 18th century, when the town experienced rapid growth as a result of its [[T\u00f8nder lace|lace]] industry. Prior to 1864, T\u00f8nder was situated in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]], so its history is intertwined with the contentious [[history of Schleswig-Holstein]]. In the 1920s, when the [[Schleswig Plebiscite]] incorporated [[Northern Schleswig]] into Denmark, 76.5% of T\u00f8nder's inhabitants voted to remain part of Germany and 23.5% voted to join Denmark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/forum/kollektives_gedaechtnis/082/nachher.html|title=Nach der Volksabstimmung|language=German|publisher=[[Deutsches Historisches Museum]]|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204040129/http://www.dhm.de/lemo/forum/kollektives_gedaechtnis/082/nachher.html|archive-date=4 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War I]], a [[Zeppelin]] base was operated in T\u00f8nder by the [[Imperial German Navy]]. The base was attacked by the British on 19 July 1918, in what is known as the [[Tondern raid]]. Seven [[Sopwith Camels]] from the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Furious|47|6}} bombed the base, hitting two of the three [[airship hangar]]s. The Zeppelins ''L.54'' and ''L.60'' inside one hangar were destroyed and a balloon inside the other was damaged. After this, T\u00f8nder was abandoned as an active airship base, and was used only as an emergency landing site. A wartime aircraft hangar survives, as do some of the ancillary buildings, but only the foundations remain of the large airship hangars. The site now houses a museum, named the Zeppelin and Garrison Museum T\u00f8nder.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.zeppelin-museum.dk/main.php?page=base&lang=en |title=The Zeppelin base in T\u00f8nder |date= |work= |publisher=Zeppelin and Garrison Museum T\u00f8nder |accessdate=7 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nAfter the First World War, T\u00f8nder was detached from Germany in spite of the majority of its population casting a pro-German vote in the [[Schleswig Plebiscites]] - as T\u00f8nder was included in Zone I, which as a whole had a strong pro-Danish majority.  In the years that followed, German political parties enjoyed a majority in the city council, and until 1945, the city was officially bilingual.\n\nAfter the end of the [[German occupation of Denmark]], the political influence of the German population dwindled considerably. In spite of the improvement in cross-border traffic, the location of the town continued to hamper industrial growth through the late 20th century, although some companies did set up businesses. Tourism has grown in importance. In 1989, T\u00f8nder Seminarium, the oldest teacher training college in Scandinavia, established in 1788, was closed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.museum-sonderjylland.dk/SIDERNE/Museerne/Bygningskulturen/03c04-Oestergade63.html|title=03c04-Oestergade63.html|website=Museum-sonderjylland.dk|accessdate=15 December 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Attractions==\n[[File:Tondern, Fussgaengerzone.jpg|thumb|Pedestrian street]]\nEvery August, the [[T\u00f8nder Festival]] offers visitors a wide variety of traditional and modern folk music. The Scouts of T\u00f8nder are twinned with [[Hemyock]], in Devon, England, and make exchange trips between the countries every few years.\n\n== Marriage ==\nSince the 1960s, as T\u00f8nder is the first town over the border in Denmark from Germany. The town has been growing into a particularly popular place to [[Marriage|elope]]. This is especially true for couples of mixed-nationalities, particularly between [[European citizens|Europeans citizens]] and non-European citizens. This is due in part to Denmark's liberal marriage laws, compared to those in nearby [[Germany]] which requires a minimum of three months administration and the ceremony has to be in [[German language|German]]. However, in Denmark it can be done in just around a week, with fewer documents required and the vows can be done in languages other than [[Danish language|the national language]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Saeed|first1=Saim|title=Love me T\u00f8nder: Europe\u2019s quickie wedding destination|url=http://www.politico.eu/article/denmark-tonder-wedding-tourism-quickie-liberal-marriage-laws/|website=Politico Europe|accessdate=7 September 2016}}</ref> In 2007, over 2500 marriages were done at T\u00f8nder town hall by non-resident couples compared to just 150 local couples.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avisen.dk/toender-er-europas-las-vegas_8248.aspx|title=T\u00f8nder er Europas Las Vegas|last=Zankel|first=Sara|date=2008-04-22|website=avisen.dk|language=da|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref>\n\n== Notable people from T\u00f8nder ==\n[[File:Heinrich W. von Gerstenberg.jpg|thumb|140px|H.W. von Gerstenberg, 1793]]\n[[File:Poul Schluter portrait 2005.jpg|thumb|140px|Poul Schluter, 2005]]\n* [[Oluf Gerhard Tychsen]] (1734-1815) a German Orientalist and Hebrew scholar, a founding father of [[Islamic]] [[numismatics]]\n* [[Heinrich Wilhelm von Gerstenberg]] (1737\u20131823) a German poet <ref>[https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/1911_Encyclop\u00e6dia_Britannica/Gerstenberg,_Heinrich_Wilhelm_von   1911 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica, Volume 11, Gerstenberg, Heinrich Wilhelm von] retrieved 23 March 2018</ref> and critic.\n* [[Johan Christian Fabricius]] (1745\u20131808) a Danish zoologist, specialising in \"Insecta\", [[arthropods]]: insects, arachnids and crustaceans\n* [[Nicolai Andresen]] (1781\u20131861) a Norwegian merchant, banker and member of [[Stortinget]]\n* [[Geskel Saloman]] (1821\u20131902) a Danish\u2013Swedish portrait and genre painter\n* [[Julius Bahnsen]] (1830\u20131881) a German philosopher, originator of [[characterology]] \n* [[Gustav Adolf Neuber]] (1850\u20131932) a German surgeon\n* [[Jannik Petersen Bjerrum]] (1851\u20131920) a Danish [[ophthalmologist]] from [[Sk\u00e6rb\u00e6k]], did [[pathogenetic]] research of [[glaucoma]]\n* [[Bernhard M.

It was released worldwide for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in August 2016, and for [[Xbox One]] in July 2018. The game is built around four pillars: exploration, survival, combat, and trading. Players are free to perform within the entirety of a [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]] deterministic [[open world]] universe, which includes over 18 [[quintillion]] planets. Through the game's procedural generation system, planets have their own ecosystems with unique forms of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and various sentient alien species may engage the player in combat or trade within planetary systems. Players advance in the game by mining for resources to power and improve their equipment, buying and selling resources using credits earned by documenting flora and fauna, and otherwise seeking out the mystery around the Atlas, an entity at the center of the galaxy.\n\nThe founder of Hello Games, Sean Murray, had wanted to create a game that captured the sense of exploration and optimism of science fiction writings and art of the 1970s and 1980s with ''No Man's Sky''. The game was developed over three years by a small team at Hello Games with promotional and publishing help from [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]. The game was seen as an ambitious project by a small team by the gaming media, and Murray and Hello Games drew significant attention leading to its release.\n\n''No Man's Sky'' received mixed reviews at its 2016 launch, with some critics praising the technical achievements of the procedurally generated universe, while others considered the gameplay lackluster and repetitive. However, the critical response was marred by the lack of several features that had been reported to be in the game, particularly [[multiplayer]] capabilities, though Murray had tried to downplay expectations prior to release. The game was further criticised due to Hello Games' lack of communication in the months following the launch, creating a hostile backlash from some of its player base. Murray stated later that Hello Games had failed to control the exaggerated expectations of the game from the media and the larger-than-expected player count at launch, and since have taken an approach of remaining quiet about updates to ''No Man's Sky'' until they are nearly ready to ship to avoid miscommunication. The promotion and marketing for ''No Man's Sky'' became a subject of debate, and the video game industry has used ''No Man's Sky'' as an example of missteps to avoid in marketing.\n\nSince the game's initial release, Hello Games has continued to improve and expand ''No Man's Sky'' to achieve the vision of the experience they wanted to build, while the game continued to have a [[cult following]] of players. The game has received multiple major content updates that have introduced several previously missing features, such as multiplayer components, while adding new features like surface vehicles, base-building, space fleet management, and [[virtual reality]] support, all of which have generally improved its overall reception.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:No mans sky screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|''No Man's Sky'' allows players to explore planets with procedurally generated flora and fauna]]\n''No Man's Sky'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[survival game]] played from a [[First-person perspective|first]] or [[Third-person perspective|third]] person perspective that allows players to engage in four principal activities: exploration, survival, combat, and trading.<ref name=\"polygon april2016\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/1/11340322/no-mans-sky-preview-ps4 | title = A brief tour of a tiny corner of No Man's Sky | first = Samit | last = Sarkar | date = 1 April 2016 | accessdate = 1 April 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160401191435/http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/1/11340322/no-mans-sky-preview-ps4 | archivedate = 1 April 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The player takes the role of a specimen of alien humanoid planetary explorer, known in-game as the Traveller<!-- British spelling, do not change -->, in an uncharted universe.

They also may be attacked by Sentinels, a self-replicating robot force that patrols the planets and takes action against those that take the planet's resources. The player can fend these off using the weapons installed on the multitool. The game uses a \"wanted level\" similar to that of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series; low wanted levels may cause small drones to appear which may be easily fought off, while giant walking machines can assault the player at higher wanted levels.<ref name=\"edge demo\"/> While in space, the Traveller may be attacked by pirates seeking their ship's cargo, or by alien factions with whom they have a poor reputation. Here, the player can use the ship's weapon systems to engage in these battles.

Once constructed, the player can then immediately return to their base via teleportation from a space station in the rest of the galaxy. The base supports adding special stations, such as research terminals, that can be manned by one of the sentient aliens, which can help to unlock additional base components and blueprints, tend to harvesting flora for resources, and other aspects. The player may opt to tear down the base and relocate to a different home planet at any time. The player also has abilities to construct devices such as automatic mineral drills in the field. The player is able to purchase starship freighters, which serve both as a space-bound base, with similar base-building and construction options as the planetary base, and as additional storage capacity that collected resources can be transferred.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | title = No Man\u2019s Sky gets gigantic update with new modes, features, fixes and more | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = 27 November 2016 | accessdate = 30 November 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129124649/http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | archivedate = 29 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Foundation update also adds in two new play modes, with the original gameplay considered as the third, default mode. [[Survival mode]] is similar to standard gameplay but the difficulty is much higher\u2014atmospheric effects have larger impact on the exosuit's armour, alien creatures are more hostile, Sentinels are more alert and deadly, and resources tend to be sparse. If a player should die in Survival mode, they must restart without being able to recover their lost progress, though they still possess their credits, alien language progress, and known blueprints. Creative mode removes much of the mechanics that can kill the player's character, and gives them unlimited resources for constructing bases.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\"/>\n\nA second update released in March 2017, known as the \"Path Finder Update\", added several new features to the game. Among these included the ability to share bases with other players, as well as new vehicles called exocraft to help in exploration. The exocraft can be built on the player's set home planet, and called upon on any other planet via a minor update released a few days afterwards.

It included significant contributions to the game's story mode, added an estimated 30 hours of narrative, and added procedurally generated missions. The player can use portals to quickly transport across the game's galaxy. A limited online cooperative mode, called \"Joint Exploration\", allows for up to 16 players to explore the same planet and use voice chat and text commands to communicate to others in close proximity, seeing each other as glowing spheres, but otherwise they cannot directly interact with each other; Hello Games called it an \"important first step into the world of synchronous co-op\".

When they arrive, they are guided by their starship's computer, directing the character to make the necessary repairs to it, and collecting the resources needed to fuel a [[hyperspace]] jump to another planetary system. En route, they encounter individual members of three alien species, the Gek, the Korvax, and the Vy'keen, that inhabit the galaxy.  During their voyage, the Traveller is compelled by an unknown force to reach the centre of the galaxy.\n\nAlong the way to the centre, the Traveller receives a message from an alien entity named Artemis, who tells them that they, like the player, are a Traveller and wished to meet others of their kind.  They stepped through a strange, ancient portal, but they got trapped on a sunless world.  After triangulating their position and talking with the local alien species, the Traveller discovers that Artemis's location does not exist.  After telling Artemis the news, the transmission ends mysteriously and the Traveller learns of another Traveller named Apollo.\n\nThe Traveller contacts Apollo, telling them about Artemis's predicament.  The player is told to uncover the connection between the portals and the Sentinels.  After a skirmish with the Sentinels, the Traveller passes through a portal and is taken aboard a large, unknown vessel in space, where it comes face to face with a cosmic being.  The Traveller is then sent to an unknown planet where they find the grave of Artemis, revealing Artemis has been dead the entire time.  While trying to contact Apollo, they accidentally contact a new entity, -null.  -null tells the Traveller that Artemis can be saved, through the use of a \"Mind Arc\".\n\nWhile in space, they are alerted to a presence of a space anomaly in a nearby system. Traveling there they find a special space station (\"space anomaly\") where two aliens wait for them, Priest Entity Nada and Specialist Polo. Nada and Polo have knowledge beyond what other aliens in the galaxy appear to possess, including being able to speak without translation to the Traveller.  They tell of the entity the player met, called \"The Atlas\", found at the centre of the galaxy.  They are able to guide the Traveller towards meeting Atlas, either by directing them to the location of a nearby Atlas Interface, the vessel they were previously transported to, or to a [[black hole]] that can quickly take the Traveller closer to the centre of the galaxy.  After constructing the Mind Arc, the Traveller must choose whether to upload Artemis's soul into a machine aboard the Anomaly or to let them die. Regardless of the choice, they are directed by a distress beacon to another portal, where they find themselves aboard another Atlas Interface.  They learn that the Atlas is dying and must warn the other Travellers in the galaxy, but is unable to contact them.\n\nThe Traveller becomes aware that they, like Nada and Polo, are different from the other sentient beings in the galaxy, having some sense of the universe's construction and nature.<ref name=\"crave plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | title = No Man\u2019s Sky Ending Explained: The Center of the Galaxy and the Simulation Theory | first = Paul | last = Tamburro | date = 11 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[CraveOnline]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821051616/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It is revealed that the galaxy itself exists as a computer simulation managed by the Atlas, and the Travellers, or the fourth race, are entities that were created by the Atlas to explore the simulation.  It is also revealed how Nada and Polo met, and how they are \"errors\" that had become self-aware of being in a simulation and isolated themselves in the anomaly to help others.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/>\n\nThe Traveller investigates more Interfaces to find themselves once again in direct communication with the Atlas.  The Atlas informs them it doesn't want to die.  In order to save itself, it directs the Traveller to continue to explore and collect information all while moving towards the centre, where the entity appears to be.  The Atlas judges the Traveller's progress, and grants it the [[blueprint]] for a different Atlas Seed if it deems the Traveller worthy.  The Traveller must continue on its journey, continuing to gain help from Nada and Polo and Atlas Seeds from other Interfaces.\n\nUltimately, the Traveller reaches the galaxy's centre, finding yet another Atlas Interface.  The Traveller must choose to either restart the simulation, saving the Atlas, or continue exploring.  If they choose to restart the simulation, the Traveller presents the Interface with the Atlas Seeds they have obtained.  The Atlas resets, upon which it creates a new galaxy, as well as creating another new Traveller entity to restart the exploration, but it is revealed this has happened many times before, each time shortening the life of the Atlas.  The Atlas tries to see into the future, past its death, but sees nothing, besides the hand of its creator on its glass casing. The current Traveller is released, free to explore on its own, while from the player's view, they are placed in control of this new Traveller, effectively restarting the game.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/><ref name=\"polygon plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky/2016/8/17/12514826/atlas-interface-story-path-guide | title = No Man's Sky's Atlas Interfaces, story path and you | first = Jeffrey | last = Parkin | date = 17 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821071150/http://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky/2016/8/17/12514826/atlas-interface-story-path-guide | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n{{main|Development of No Man's Sky}}\n\n''No Man's Sky'' represented Hello Games' vision of a broad, attention-getting game that they wanted to pursue while they secured their financial well being through the ''[[Joe Danger]]'' series of games.<ref name=\"nms hello games\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/12/19/the-secret-story-behind-no-man-s-sky.aspx | title = The Secret Story Behind No Man's Sky | first = Jeff | last = Cork | date = 19 December 2014 | accessdate = 19 December 2014 | work = [[Game Informer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101227/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/12/19/the-secret-story-behind-no-man-s-sky.aspx | archivedate = 23 December 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The game's original prototype was worked on by Hello Games' Sean Murray, who wanted to create a game about the spirit of exploration inspired by the optimistic science fiction of [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Arthur C.

Keighley felt that Murray could not \"rip off that band-aid\" and explain exactly what had made it and had to be cut for the game prior to release, and in the end appeared to \"disrespect his audience\".

It was released worldwide for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in August 2016, and for [[Xbox One]] in July 2018. The game is built around four pillars: exploration, survival, combat, and trading. Players are free to perform within the entirety of a [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]] deterministic [[open world]] universe, which includes over 18 [[quintillion]] planets. Through the game's procedural generation system, planets have their own ecosystems with unique forms of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and various sentient alien species may engage the player in combat or trade within planetary systems. Players advance in the game by mining for resources to power and improve their equipment, buying and selling resources using credits earned by documenting flora and fauna, and otherwise seeking out the mystery around the Atlas, an entity at the center of the galaxy.\n\nThe founder of Hello Games, Sean Murray, had wanted to create a game that captured the sense of exploration and optimism of science fiction writings and art of the 1970s and 1980s with ''No Man's Sky''. The game was developed over three years by a small team at Hello Games with promotional and publishing help from [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]. The game was seen as an ambitious project by a small team by the gaming media, and Murray and Hello Games drew significant attention leading to its release.\n\n''No Man's Sky'' received mixed reviews at its 2016 launch, with some critics praising the technical achievements of the procedurally generated universe, while others considered the gameplay lackluster and repetitive. However, the critical response was marred by the lack of several features that had been reported to be in the game, particularly [[multiplayer]] capabilities, though Murray had tried to downplay expectations prior to release. The game was further criticised due to Hello Games' lack of communication in the months following the launch, creating a hostile backlash from some of its player base. Murray stated later that Hello Games had failed to control the exaggerated expectations of the game from the media and the larger-than-expected player count at launch, and since have taken an approach of remaining quiet about updates to ''No Man's Sky'' until they are nearly ready to ship to avoid miscommunication. The promotion and marketing for ''No Man's Sky'' became a subject of debate, and the video game industry has used ''No Man's Sky'' as an example of missteps to avoid in marketing.\n\nSince the game's initial release, Hello Games has continued to improve and expand ''No Man's Sky'' to achieve the vision of the experience they wanted to build, while the game continued to have a [[cult following]] of players. The game has received multiple major content updates that have introduced several previously missing features, such as multiplayer components, while adding new features like surface vehicles, base-building, space fleet management, and [[virtual reality]] support, all of which have generally improved its overall reception.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:No mans sky screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|''No Man's Sky'' allows players to explore planets with procedurally generated flora and fauna]]\n''No Man's Sky'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[survival game]] played from a [[First-person perspective|first]] or [[Third-person perspective|third]] person perspective that allows players to engage in four principal activities: exploration, survival, combat, and trading.<ref name=\"polygon april2016\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/1/11340322/no-mans-sky-preview-ps4 | title = A brief tour of a tiny corner of No Man's Sky | first = Samit | last = Sarkar | date = 1 April 2016 | accessdate = 1 April 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160401191435/http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/1/11340322/no-mans-sky-preview-ps4 | archivedate = 1 April 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The player takes the role of a specimen of alien humanoid planetary explorer, known in-game as the Traveller<!-- British spelling, do not change -->, in an uncharted universe.

They also may be attacked by Sentinels, a self-replicating robot force that patrols the planets and takes action against those that take the planet's resources. The player can fend these off using the weapons installed on the multitool. The game uses a \"wanted level\" similar to that of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series; low wanted levels may cause small drones to appear which may be easily fought off, while giant walking machines can assault the player at higher wanted levels.<ref name=\"edge demo\"/> While in space, the Traveller may be attacked by pirates seeking their ship's cargo, or by alien factions with whom they have a poor reputation. Here, the player can use the ship's weapon systems to engage in these battles.

Once constructed, the player can then immediately return to their base via teleportation from a space station in the rest of the galaxy. The base supports adding special stations, such as research terminals, that can be manned by one of the sentient aliens, which can help to unlock additional base components and blueprints, tend to harvesting flora for resources, and other aspects. The player may opt to tear down the base and relocate to a different home planet at any time. The player also has abilities to construct devices such as automatic mineral drills in the field. The player is able to purchase starship freighters, which serve both as a space-bound base, with similar base-building and construction options as the planetary base, and as additional storage capacity that collected resources can be transferred.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | title = No Man\u2019s Sky gets gigantic update with new modes, features, fixes and more | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = 27 November 2016 | accessdate = 30 November 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129124649/http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | archivedate = 29 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Foundation update also adds in two new play modes, with the original gameplay considered as the third, default mode. [[Survival mode]] is similar to standard gameplay but the difficulty is much higher\u2014atmospheric effects have larger impact on the exosuit's armour, alien creatures are more hostile, Sentinels are more alert and deadly, and resources tend to be sparse. If a player should die in Survival mode, they must restart without being able to recover their lost progress, though they still possess their credits, alien language progress, and known blueprints. Creative mode removes much of the mechanics that can kill the player's character, and gives them unlimited resources for constructing bases.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\"/>\n\nA second update released in March 2017, known as the \"Path Finder Update\", added several new features to the game. Among these included the ability to share bases with other players, as well as new vehicles called exocraft to help in exploration. The exocraft can be built on the player's set home planet, and called upon on any other planet via a minor update released a few days afterwards.

It included significant contributions to the game's story mode, added an estimated 30 hours of narrative, and added procedurally generated missions. The player can use portals to quickly transport across the game's galaxy. A limited online cooperative mode, called \"Joint Exploration\", allows for up to 16 players to explore the same planet and use voice chat and text commands to communicate to others in close proximity, seeing each other as glowing spheres, but otherwise they cannot directly interact with each other; Hello Games called it an \"important first step into the world of synchronous co-op\".

When they arrive, they are guided by their starship's computer, directing the character to make the necessary repairs to it, and collecting the resources needed to fuel a [[hyperspace]] jump to another planetary system. En route, they encounter individual members of three alien species, the Gek, the Korvax, and the Vy'keen, that inhabit the galaxy.  During their voyage, the Traveller is compelled by an unknown force to reach the centre of the galaxy.\n\nAlong the way to the centre, the Traveller receives a message from an alien entity named Artemis, who tells them that they, like the player, are a Traveller and wished to meet others of their kind.  They stepped through a strange, ancient portal, but they got trapped on a sunless world.  After triangulating their position and talking with the local alien species, the Traveller discovers that Artemis's location does not exist.  After telling Artemis the news, the transmission ends mysteriously and the Traveller learns of another Traveller named Apollo.\n\nThe Traveller contacts Apollo, telling them about Artemis's predicament.  The player is told to uncover the connection between the portals and the Sentinels.  After a skirmish with the Sentinels, the Traveller passes through a portal and is taken aboard a large, unknown vessel in space, where it comes face to face with a cosmic being.  The Traveller is then sent to an unknown planet where they find the grave of Artemis, revealing Artemis has been dead the entire time.  While trying to contact Apollo, they accidentally contact a new entity, -null.  -null tells the Traveller that Artemis can be saved, through the use of a \"Mind Arc\".\n\nWhile in space, they are alerted to a presence of a space anomaly in a nearby system. Traveling there they find a special space station (\"space anomaly\") where two aliens wait for them, Priest Entity Nada and Specialist Polo. Nada and Polo have knowledge beyond what other aliens in the galaxy appear to possess, including being able to speak without translation to the Traveller.  They tell of the entity the player met, called \"The Atlas\", found at the centre of the galaxy.  They are able to guide the Traveller towards meeting Atlas, either by directing them to the location of a nearby Atlas Interface, the vessel they were previously transported to, or to a [[black hole]] that can quickly take the Traveller closer to the centre of the galaxy.  After constructing the Mind Arc, the Traveller must choose whether to upload Artemis's soul into a machine aboard the Anomaly or to let them die. Regardless of the choice, they are directed by a distress beacon to another portal, where they find themselves aboard another Atlas Interface.  They learn that the Atlas is dying and must warn the other Travellers in the galaxy, but is unable to contact them.\n\nThe Traveller becomes aware that they, like Nada and Polo, are different from the other sentient beings in the galaxy, having some sense of the universe's construction and nature.<ref name=\"crave plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | title = No Man\u2019s Sky Ending Explained: The Center of the Galaxy and the Simulation Theory | first = Paul | last = Tamburro | date = 11 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[CraveOnline]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821051616/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It is revealed that the galaxy itself exists as a computer simulation managed by the Atlas, and the Travellers, or the fourth race, are entities that were created by the Atlas to explore the simulation.  It is also revealed how Nada and Polo met, and how they are \"errors\" that had become self-aware of being in a simulation and isolated themselves in the anomaly to help others.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/>\n\nThe Traveller investigates more Interfaces to find themselves once again in direct communication with the Atlas.  The Atlas informs them it doesn't want to die.  In order to save itself, it directs the Traveller to continue to explore and collect information all while moving towards the centre, where the entity appears to be.  The Atlas judges the Traveller's progress, and grants it the [[blueprint]] for a different Atlas Seed if it deems the Traveller worthy.  The Traveller must continue on its journey, continuing to gain help from Nada and Polo and Atlas Seeds from other Interfaces.\n\nUltimately, the Traveller reaches the galaxy's centre, finding yet another Atlas Interface.  The Traveller must choose to either restart the simulation, saving the Atlas, or continue exploring.  If they choose to restart the simulation, the Traveller presents the Interface with the Atlas Seeds they have obtained.  The Atlas resets, upon which it creates a new galaxy, as well as creating another new Traveller entity to restart the exploration, but it is revealed this has happened many times before, each time shortening the life of the Atlas.  The Atlas tries to see into the future, past its death, but sees nothing, besides the hand of its creator on its glass casing. The current Traveller is released, free to explore on its own, while from the player's view, they are placed in control of this new Traveller, effectively restarting the game.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/><ref name=\"polygon plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky/2016/8/17/12514826/atlas-interface-story-path-guide | title = No Man's Sky's Atlas Interfaces, story path and you | first = Jeffrey | last = Parkin | date = 17 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821071150/http://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky/2016/8/17/12514826/atlas-interface-story-path-guide | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n{{main|Development of No Man's Sky}}\n\n''No Man's Sky'' represented Hello Games' vision of a broad, attention-getting game that they wanted to pursue while they secured their financial well being through the ''[[Joe Danger]]'' series of games.<ref name=\"nms hello games\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/12/19/the-secret-story-behind-no-man-s-sky.aspx | title = The Secret Story Behind No Man's Sky | first = Jeff | last = Cork | date = 19 December 2014 | accessdate = 19 December 2014 | work = [[Game Informer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101227/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/12/19/the-secret-story-behind-no-man-s-sky.aspx | archivedate = 23 December 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The game's original prototype was worked on by Hello Games' Sean Murray, who wanted to create a game about the spirit of exploration inspired by the optimistic science fiction of [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Arthur C.

Keighley felt that Murray could not \"rip off that band-aid\" and explain exactly what had made it and had to be cut for the game prior to release, and in the end appeared to \"disrespect his audience\".
