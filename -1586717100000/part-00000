The clinical syndrome is associated with pathological findings including pneumonia, [[eosinophilic pneumonia]], [[cryptogenic organizing pneumonia]], acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, and [[Diffuse alveolar damage|diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)]]. Of these, the pathology most commonly associated with ARDS is DAD, which is characterized by a diffuse inflammation of lung tissue. The triggering insult to the tissue usually results in an initial release of [[cytokine|chemical signals]] and other inflammatory mediators secreted by local [[epithelium|epithelial]] and [[endothelium|endothelial]] cells.\n\n[[Neutrophils]] and some T-[[lymphocytes]] quickly migrate into the inflamed lung tissue and contribute in the amplification of the phenomenon. Typical histological presentation involves diffuse [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] damage and [[hyaline]] membrane formation in alveolar walls. Although the triggering mechanisms are not completely understood, recent research has examined the role of inflammation and mechanical stress.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Transfusion-related acute lung injury chest X-ray.gif|thumb|upright=2.0|A chest x-ray of [[transfusion-related acute lung injury]] which lead to ARDS]]\nDiagnostic criteria for ARDS have changed over time as understanding of the [[Pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome|pathophysiology]] has evolved.

Generally, radiographic findings of fluid accumulation (pulmonary edema) affecting both lungs and unrelated to increased cardiopulmonary vascular pressure (such as in heart failure) may be suggestive of ARDS. \nUltrasound findings suggestive of ARDS include the following:\n* Anterior subpleural consolidations\n* Absence or reduction of lung sliding\n* \"Spared areas\" of normal parenchyma\n* [[Pleura]]l line abnormalities (irregular thickened fragmented pleural line)\n* Nonhomogeneous distribution of B-lines (a characteristic ultrasound finding suggestive of fluid accumulation in the lungs)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Volpicelli|first=Giovanni|last2=Elbarbary|first2=Mahmoud|last3=Blaivas|first3=Michael|last4=Lichtenstein|first4=Daniel A.|last5=Mathis|first5=Gebhard|last6=Kirkpatrick|first6=Andrew W.|last7=Melniker|first7=Lawrence|last8=Gargani|first8=Luna|last9=Noble|first9=Vicki E.|date=2012-04-01|title=International evidence-based recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|volume=38|issue=4|pages=577\u2013591|doi=10.1007/s00134-012-2513-4|issn=1432-1238|pmid=22392031}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome is usually treated with [[mechanical ventilation]] in the intensive care unit (ICU). Mechanical ventilation is usually delivered through a rigid tube which enters the oral cavity and is secured in the [[trachea|airway]] (endotracheal intubation), or by [[tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] when prolonged ventilation (\u22652 weeks) is necessary. The role of [[non-invasive ventilation]] is limited to the very early period of the disease or to prevent worsening respiratory distress in individuals with [[atypical pneumonia]]s, [[pulmonary contusion|lung bruising]], or major surgery patients, who are at risk of developing ARDS. Treatment of the underlying cause is crucial. Appropriate [[antibiotic]] therapy is started as soon as [[microbiological culture|culture]] results are available, or if infection is suspected (whichever is earlier). Empirical therapy may be appropriate if local microbiological surveillance is efficient. Where possible the origin of the infection is removed. When sepsis is diagnosed, appropriate local [[Guideline (medical)|protocols]] are followed.\n\n===Mechanical ventilation===\n{{further|Dual-control modes of ventilation|l1=Pressure regulated volume control}}\n\nThe overall goal of mechanical ventilation is to maintain acceptable gas exchange to meet the body's metabolic demands and to minimize adverse effects in its application. The parameters PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure, to keep alveoli open), mean airway pressure (to promote recruitment (opening) of easily collapsible alveoli and predictor of hemodynamic effects) and [[plateau pressure]] (best predictor of alveolar overdistention) are used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malhotra A |title=Low-tidal-volume ventilation in the acute respiratory distress syndrome |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=357 |issue=11 |pages=1113\u201320 |year=2007 |pmid=17855672 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct074213 |pmc=2287190}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, mechanical ventilation aimed to achieve tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) of 12\u201315 ml/kg (where the weight is [[body weight#ideal body weight|ideal body weight]] rather than actual weight). Recent studies have shown that high tidal volumes can overstretch alveoli resulting in [[volutrauma]] (secondary lung injury). The ARDS Clinical Network, or ARDSNet, completed a clinical trial that showed improved mortality when people with ARDS were ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg compared to the traditional 12 ml/kg. Low tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) may cause a permitted [[permissive hypercapnia|rise in blood carbon dioxide levels]] and [[atelectasis|collapse of alveoli]]<ref name=\"Rippe-ARDS\"/> because of their inherent tendency to increase shunting within the lung. Physiologic dead space cannot change as it is ventilation without perfusion. A shunt is perfusion without ventilation.\n\nLow tidal volume ventilation was the primary independent variable associated with reduced mortality in the NIH-sponsored ARDSnet trial of tidal volume in ARDS. Plateau pressure less than 30&nbsp;cm {{chem|H|2|O}} was a secondary goal, and subsequent analyses of the data from the ARDSnet trial and other experimental data demonstrate that there appears to be no safe upper limit to plateau pressure; regardless of plateau pressure, individuals with ARDS fare better with low tidal volumes.<ref name=\"Hager05\">{{cite journal|last1=Hager|first1=DN|last2=Krishnan|first2=JA|last3=Hayden|first3=DL|last4=Brower|first4=RG|last5=ARDS Clinical Trials Network|title=Tidal volume reduction in patients with acute lung injury when plateau pressures are not high|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=November 2005|volume=172|issue=10|pages=1241\u20135|pmid=16081547|doi=10.1164/rccm.200501-048cp|pmc=2718413}}</ref>\n\n====Airway pressure release ventilation====\nNo particular ventilator mode is known to improve mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSome [[respiratory therapist|practitioners]] favor [[airway pressure release ventilation]] when treating ARDS.

In ARDS, three populations of alveoli can be distinguished.  There are normal alveoli which are always inflated and engaging in gas exchange, flooded alveoli which can never, under any ventilatory regime, be used for gas exchange, and atelectatic or partially flooded alveoli that can be \"recruited\" to participate in gas exchange under certain ventilatory regimens.  The recruitable alveoli represent a continuous population, some of which can be recruited with minimal PEEP, and others which can only be recruited with high levels of PEEP.  An additional complication is that some alveoli can only be opened with higher airway pressures than are needed to keep them open, hence the justification for maneuvers where PEEP is increased to very high levels for seconds to minutes before dropping the PEEP to a lower level. PEEP can be harmful; high PEEP necessarily increases mean airway pressure and alveolar pressure, which can damage normal alveoli by overdistension resulting in DAD. A compromise between the beneficial and adverse effects of PEEP is inevitable.\n\nThe 'best PEEP' used to be defined as 'some' cm{{chem|H|2|O}} above the lower inflection point (LIP) in the [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] pressure-volume relationship curve of the lung. Recent research has shown that the LIP-point pressure is no better than any pressure above it, as recruitment of collapsed alveoli{{mdash}}and, more importantly, the overdistension of aerated units{{mdash}}occur throughout the whole inflation. Despite the awkwardness of most procedures used to trace the pressure-volume curve, it is still used by some{{who|date=October 2013}} to define the ''minimum'' PEEP to be applied to their patients. Some new ventilators can automatically plot a pressure-volume curve.\n\nPEEP may also be set empirically. Some authors{{who|date=October 2013}} suggest performing a 'recruiting maneuver'{{mdash}}a short time at a very high continuous positive airway pressure, such as 50&nbsp;cm{{chem|H|2|O}} (4.9 kPa){{mdash}}to recruit or open collapsed units with a high distending pressure before restoring previous ventilation. The final PEEP level should be the one just before the drop in Pa{{chem|O|2}} or [[hemoglobin|peripheral blood oxygen saturation]] during a step-down trial.\n\n[[Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure|Intrinsic PEEP]] (iPEEP) or auto-PEEP{{mdash}}first described by John Marini of St. Paul Regions Hospital{{mdash}}is a potentially unrecognized contributor to PEEP in intubated individuals.  When ventilating at high frequencies, its contribution can be substantial, particularly in people with obstructive lung disease such as [[asthma]] or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). iPEEP has been measured in very few formal studies on ventilation in ARDS, and its contribution is largely unknown. Its measurement is recommended in the treatment of people who have ARDS, especially when using [[high-frequency ventilation|high-frequency (oscillatory/jet) ventilation]].\n\n=== Prone position ===\nThe position of lung infiltrates in acute respiratory distress syndrome is non-uniform.

The clinical syndrome is associated with pathological findings including pneumonia, [[eosinophilic pneumonia]], [[cryptogenic organizing pneumonia]], acute fibrinous organizing pneumonia, and [[Diffuse alveolar damage|diffuse alveolar damage (DAD)]]. Of these, the pathology most commonly associated with ARDS is DAD, which is characterized by a diffuse inflammation of lung tissue. The triggering insult to the tissue usually results in an initial release of [[cytokine|chemical signals]] and other inflammatory mediators secreted by local [[epithelium|epithelial]] and [[endothelium|endothelial]] cells.\n\n[[Neutrophils]] and some T-[[lymphocytes]] quickly migrate into the inflamed lung tissue and contribute in the amplification of the phenomenon. Typical histological presentation involves diffuse [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveolar]] damage and [[hyaline]] membrane formation in alveolar walls. Although the triggering mechanisms are not completely understood, recent research has examined the role of inflammation and mechanical stress.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Transfusion-related acute lung injury chest X-ray.gif|thumb|upright=2.0|A chest x-ray of [[transfusion-related acute lung injury]] which lead to ARDS]]\nDiagnostic criteria for ARDS have changed over time as understanding of the [[Pathophysiology of acute respiratory distress syndrome|pathophysiology]] has evolved.

Generally, radiographic findings of fluid accumulation (pulmonary edema) affecting both lungs and unrelated to increased cardiopulmonary vascular pressure (such as in heart failure) may be suggestive of ARDS. \nUltrasound findings suggestive of ARDS include the following:\n* Anterior subpleural consolidations\n* Absence or reduction of lung sliding\n* \"Spared areas\" of normal parenchyma\n* [[Pleura]]l line abnormalities (irregular thickened fragmented pleural line)\n* Nonhomogeneous distribution of B-lines (a characteristic ultrasound finding suggestive of fluid accumulation in the lungs)<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Volpicelli|first=Giovanni|last2=Elbarbary|first2=Mahmoud|last3=Blaivas|first3=Michael|last4=Lichtenstein|first4=Daniel A.|last5=Mathis|first5=Gebhard|last6=Kirkpatrick|first6=Andrew W.|last7=Melniker|first7=Lawrence|last8=Gargani|first8=Luna|last9=Noble|first9=Vicki E.|date=2012-04-01|title=International evidence-based recommendations for point-of-care lung ultrasound|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|volume=38|issue=4|pages=577\u2013591|doi=10.1007/s00134-012-2513-4|issn=1432-1238|pmid=22392031}}</ref>\n\n==Treatment==\nAcute respiratory distress syndrome is usually treated with [[mechanical ventilation]] in the intensive care unit (ICU). Mechanical ventilation is usually delivered through a rigid tube which enters the oral cavity and is secured in the [[trachea|airway]] (endotracheal intubation), or by [[tracheotomy|tracheostomy]] when prolonged ventilation (\u22652 weeks) is necessary. The role of [[non-invasive ventilation]] is limited to the very early period of the disease or to prevent worsening respiratory distress in individuals with [[atypical pneumonia]]s, [[pulmonary contusion|lung bruising]], or major surgery patients, who are at risk of developing ARDS. Treatment of the underlying cause is crucial. Appropriate [[antibiotic]] therapy is started as soon as [[microbiological culture|culture]] results are available, or if infection is suspected (whichever is earlier). Empirical therapy may be appropriate if local microbiological surveillance is efficient. Where possible the origin of the infection is removed. When sepsis is diagnosed, appropriate local [[Guideline (medical)|protocols]] are followed.\n\n===Mechanical ventilation===\n{{further|Dual-control modes of ventilation|l1=Pressure regulated volume control}}\n\nThe overall goal of mechanical ventilation is to maintain acceptable gas exchange to meet the body's metabolic demands and to minimize adverse effects in its application. The parameters PEEP (positive end-expiratory pressure, to keep alveoli open), mean airway pressure (to promote recruitment (opening) of easily collapsible alveoli and predictor of hemodynamic effects) and [[plateau pressure]] (best predictor of alveolar overdistention) are used.<ref>{{cite journal |author=Malhotra A |title=Low-tidal-volume ventilation in the acute respiratory distress syndrome |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=357 |issue=11 |pages=1113\u201320 |year=2007 |pmid=17855672 |doi=10.1056/NEJMct074213 |pmc=2287190}}</ref>\n\nPreviously, mechanical ventilation aimed to achieve tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) of 12\u201315 ml/kg (where the weight is [[body weight#ideal body weight|ideal body weight]] rather than actual weight). Recent studies have shown that high tidal volumes can overstretch alveoli resulting in [[volutrauma]] (secondary lung injury). The ARDS Clinical Network, or ARDSNet, completed a clinical trial that showed improved mortality when people with ARDS were ventilated with a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg compared to the traditional 12 ml/kg. Low tidal volumes (''V''<sub>t</sub>) may cause a permitted [[permissive hypercapnia|rise in blood carbon dioxide levels]] and [[atelectasis|collapse of alveoli]]<ref name=\"Rippe-ARDS\"/> because of their inherent tendency to increase shunting within the lung. Physiologic dead space cannot change as it is ventilation without perfusion. A shunt is perfusion without ventilation.\n\nLow tidal volume ventilation was the primary independent variable associated with reduced mortality in the NIH-sponsored ARDSnet trial of tidal volume in ARDS. Plateau pressure less than 30&nbsp;cm {{chem|H|2|O}} was a secondary goal, and subsequent analyses of the data from the ARDSnet trial and other experimental data demonstrate that there appears to be no safe upper limit to plateau pressure; regardless of plateau pressure, individuals with ARDS fare better with low tidal volumes.<ref name=\"Hager05\">{{cite journal|last1=Hager|first1=DN|last2=Krishnan|first2=JA|last3=Hayden|first3=DL|last4=Brower|first4=RG|last5=ARDS Clinical Trials Network|title=Tidal volume reduction in patients with acute lung injury when plateau pressures are not high|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine|date=November 2005|volume=172|issue=10|pages=1241\u20135|pmid=16081547|doi=10.1164/rccm.200501-048cp|pmc=2718413}}</ref>\n\n====Airway pressure release ventilation====\nNo particular ventilator mode is known to improve mortality in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nSome [[respiratory therapist|practitioners]] favor [[airway pressure release ventilation]] when treating ARDS.

In ARDS, three populations of alveoli can be distinguished.  There are normal alveoli which are always inflated and engaging in gas exchange, flooded alveoli which can never, under any ventilatory regime, be used for gas exchange, and atelectatic or partially flooded alveoli that can be \"recruited\" to participate in gas exchange under certain ventilatory regimens.  The recruitable alveoli represent a continuous population, some of which can be recruited with minimal PEEP, and others which can only be recruited with high levels of PEEP.  An additional complication is that some alveoli can only be opened with higher airway pressures than are needed to keep them open, hence the justification for maneuvers where PEEP is increased to very high levels for seconds to minutes before dropping the PEEP to a lower level. PEEP can be harmful; high PEEP necessarily increases mean airway pressure and alveolar pressure, which can damage normal alveoli by overdistension resulting in DAD. A compromise between the beneficial and adverse effects of PEEP is inevitable.\n\nThe 'best PEEP' used to be defined as 'some' cm{{chem|H|2|O}} above the lower inflection point (LIP) in the [[Sigmoid function|sigmoidal]] pressure-volume relationship curve of the lung. Recent research has shown that the LIP-point pressure is no better than any pressure above it, as recruitment of collapsed alveoli{{mdash}}and, more importantly, the overdistension of aerated units{{mdash}}occur throughout the whole inflation. Despite the awkwardness of most procedures used to trace the pressure-volume curve, it is still used by some{{who|date=October 2013}} to define the ''minimum'' PEEP to be applied to their patients. Some new ventilators can automatically plot a pressure-volume curve.\n\nPEEP may also be set empirically. Some authors{{who|date=October 2013}} suggest performing a 'recruiting maneuver'{{mdash}}a short time at a very high continuous positive airway pressure, such as 50&nbsp;cm{{chem|H|2|O}} (4.9 kPa){{mdash}}to recruit or open collapsed units with a high distending pressure before restoring previous ventilation. The final PEEP level should be the one just before the drop in Pa{{chem|O|2}} or [[hemoglobin|peripheral blood oxygen saturation]] during a step-down trial.\n\n[[Intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure|Intrinsic PEEP]] (iPEEP) or auto-PEEP{{mdash}}first described by John Marini of St. Paul Regions Hospital{{mdash}}is a potentially unrecognized contributor to PEEP in intubated individuals.  When ventilating at high frequencies, its contribution can be substantial, particularly in people with obstructive lung disease such as [[asthma]] or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD). iPEEP has been measured in very few formal studies on ventilation in ARDS, and its contribution is largely unknown. Its measurement is recommended in the treatment of people who have ARDS, especially when using [[high-frequency ventilation|high-frequency (oscillatory/jet) ventilation]].\n\n=== Prone position ===\nThe position of lung infiltrates in acute respiratory distress syndrome is non-uniform.

Multiple studies have shown the effectiveness of ECMO in acute respiratory failure.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Makdisi|first1=G|last2=Wang|first2=IW|title=Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) review of a lifesaving technology|journal=Journal of Thoracic Disease|date=July 2015|volume=7|issue=7|pages=E166\u201376|pmid=26380745|doi=10.3978/j.issn.2072-1439.2015.07.17|pmc=4522501}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hemmila|first1=MR|last2=Rowe|first2=SA|last3=Boules|first3=TN|last4=Miskulin|first4=J|last5=McGillicuddy|first5=JW|last6=Schuerer|first6=DJ|last7=Haft|first7=JW|last8=Swaniker|first8=F|last9=Arbabi|first9=S|last10=Hirschl|first10=RB|last11=Bartlett|first11=RH|title=Extracorporeal life support for severe acute respiratory distress syndrome in adults|journal=Annals of Surgery|date=October 2004|volume=240|issue=4|pages=595\u2013605; discussion 605\u20137|pmid=15383787|pmc=1356461|doi=10.1097/01.sla.0000141159.90676.2d}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Brogan|first1=TV|last2=Thiagarajan|first2=RR|last3=Rycus|first3=PT|last4=Bartlett|first4=RH|last5=Bratton|first5=SL|title=Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation in adults with severe respiratory failure: a multi-center database|journal=Intensive Care Medicine|date=December 2009|volume=35|issue=12|pages=2105\u201314|pmid=19768656|doi=10.1007/s00134-009-1661-7}}</ref> Specifically, the CESAR (Conventional ventilatory support versus Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for Severe Acute Respiratory failure) trial<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Peek|first1=GJ|last2=Mugford|first2=M|last3=Tiruvoipati|first3=R|last4=Wilson|first4=A|last5=Allen|first5=E|last6=Thalanany|first6=MM|last7=Hibbert|first7=CL|last8=Truesdale|first8=A|last9=Clemens|first9=F|last10=Cooper|first10=N|last11=Firmin|first11=RK|last12=Elbourne|first12=D|last13=CESAR trial|first13=collaboration|title=Efficacy and economic assessment of conventional ventilatory support versus extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe adult respiratory failure (CESAR): a multicentre randomised controlled trial|journal=Lancet|date=17 October 2009|volume=374|issue=9698|pages=1351\u201363|pmid=19762075|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(09)61069-2}}</ref> demonstrated that a group referred to an ECMO center demonstrated significantly increased survival compared to conventional management (63% to 47%).<ref>{{cite book|last1=editors|first1=Fabio Sangalli, Nicol\u00f2 Patroniti, Antonio Pesenti|title=ECMO-- extracorporeal life support in adults|date=2014|isbn=978-88-470-5427-1}}</ref>\n\n===Ineffective treatments===\n\nAs of 2019, there is no evidence showing that treatments with exogenous [[surfactant]]s, [[statin]]s, [[Beta blocker|beta-blockers]] or [[Acetylcysteine|n-acetylcysteine]] decreases early mortality, late all-cause mortality, duration of mechanical ventilation, or number of ventilator-free days.<ref name=Lew2019 />\n\n== Prognosis ==\nThe overall prognosis of ARDS is poor, with mortality rates of approximately 40%.<ref name=Lew2019>{{Cite journal|last=Lewis|first=Sharon R.|last2=Pritchard|first2=Michael W.|last3=Thomas|first3=Carmel M.|last4=Smith|first4=Andrew F.|date=July 23, 2019|title=Pharmacological agents for adults with acute respiratory distress syndrome|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=7|pages=CD004477|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004477.pub3|issn=1469-493X|pmc=6646953|pmid=31334568}}</ref>\n\n==Epidemiology==\n\nThe annual rate of ARDS is generally  13\u201323 people per 100,000 in the general population.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lewandowski K, Lewandowski M | year = 2006 | title = Epidemiology of ARDS | url = | journal = Minerva Anestesiol | volume = 72 | issue = 6| pages = 473\u20137 | pmid = 16682918 }}</ref> It is more common in people who are [[mechanical ventilation|mechanically ventilated]] with acute lung injury (ALI) occurring 16% of ventilated people.

Although Rice made his debut as a [[relief pitcher]], he is best known as an outfielder. Playing for the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] from {{baseball year|1915}} until {{baseball year|1933}}, he was regularly among the [[American League]] leaders in [[run (baseball)|runs scored]], [[hit (baseball)|hits]], [[stolen base]]s and [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]. He led the Senators to three postseasons and a [[World Series]] championship in [[1924 World Series|1924]]. He batted left-handed but threw right-handed. Rice played his final year, {{baseball year|1934}}, for the [[Cleveland Indians]]. He was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1963.\n\nRice was best known for making a controversial catch in the [[1925 World Series]] which carried him over the fence and into the stands. While he was alive, Rice maintained a sense of mystery around the catch, which had been ruled an out. He wrote a letter that was only opened after his 1974 death; it claimed that he had maintained possession of the ball the entire time.\n\n==Early life==\nRice was the first of six children born to Charles Rice and Louisa Newmyer. Charles and Louisa married about two months after his birth. He grew up in various towns near [[Morocco, Indiana]], on the Indiana-Illinois border, and considered Morocco his hometown.<ref>Carroll, p. 9.</ref> He was known as \"Eddie\" during his childhood. In 1908, Rice married 16-year-old Beulah Stam.<ref>Carroll, pp. 9-10.</ref> They lived in [[Watseka, Illinois]], where Rice ran the family farm, worked at several jobs in the area, and attended tryouts for various professional baseball teams.<ref>Paul Niemann, ''Red, White & True Mysteries'', [[Tooele Transcript-Bulletin]], 10 November 2011</ref>\n\nBy April 1912, Rice and his wife had two children, aged 18 months and three years. While Rice's wife cared for the children, Rice traveled to [[Galesburg, Illinois]], to play for a spot on a minor league baseball team, the [[Galesburg Pavers]] of the [[Central Association]].<ref>Carroll, p. 11.</ref> Rice spent about a week with the team, appearing in three exhibition games. In an appearance on April 21, Rice entered the game as a relief pitcher and finished the last three innings of a Pavers victory, giving up one run in a game marked by forceful winds.<ref>Carroll, pp. 11-12.</ref>\n\nThat same day, Rice's wife took their children on a day trip to the homestead of Rice's parents in Morocco, about 20 miles from Watseka. A storm arose and a tornado swept across the homestead, destroying the house and most of the outbuildings. The tornado killed Rice's wife, his two children, his mother, his two younger sisters and a farmhand. Rice's father survived for another week before also succumbing to his injuries. Rice had to attend two funerals: one for his parents and sisters, and a second for his wife and children.<ref>Carroll, pp. 12-15.</ref>\n\nRice played for the [[Muscatine Muskies]] of the Central Association in 1912, hitting .194 in 18 games. He did not play in 1913.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=rice--001edg</ref>\n\n==Early baseball career==\nProbably wracked with grief, Rice spent the next year wandering the area and working at several jobs.

His team lost the Series in seven games.\n\nControversy persisted over whether Rice had actually caught the ball and whether he had kept possession of it. Some Pittsburgh fans sent signed and notarized documents claiming that they saw a fan pick up the ball and put it back in Rice's glove. Rice himself would not tell, answering only, \"The umpire said I caught it.\" Magazines offered to pay him for the story, but Rice turned them down, saying, \"I don't need the money.

Although Rice made his debut as a [[relief pitcher]], he is best known as an outfielder. Playing for the [[Washington Senators (1901\u201360)|Washington Senators]] from {{baseball year|1915}} until {{baseball year|1933}}, he was regularly among the [[American League]] leaders in [[run (baseball)|runs scored]], [[hit (baseball)|hits]], [[stolen base]]s and [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]]. He led the Senators to three postseasons and a [[World Series]] championship in [[1924 World Series|1924]]. He batted left-handed but threw right-handed. Rice played his final year, {{baseball year|1934}}, for the [[Cleveland Indians]]. He was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1963.\n\nRice was best known for making a controversial catch in the [[1925 World Series]] which carried him over the fence and into the stands. While he was alive, Rice maintained a sense of mystery around the catch, which had been ruled an out. He wrote a letter that was only opened after his 1974 death; it claimed that he had maintained possession of the ball the entire time.\n\n==Early life==\nRice was the first of six children born to Charles Rice and Louisa Newmyer. Charles and Louisa married about two months after his birth. He grew up in various towns near [[Morocco, Indiana]], on the Indiana-Illinois border, and considered Morocco his hometown.<ref>Carroll, p. 9.</ref> He was known as \"Eddie\" during his childhood. In 1908, Rice married 16-year-old Beulah Stam.<ref>Carroll, pp. 9-10.</ref> They lived in [[Watseka, Illinois]], where Rice ran the family farm, worked at several jobs in the area, and attended tryouts for various professional baseball teams.<ref>Paul Niemann, ''Red, White & True Mysteries'', [[Tooele Transcript-Bulletin]], 10 November 2011</ref>\n\nBy April 1912, Rice and his wife had two children, aged 18 months and three years. While Rice's wife cared for the children, Rice traveled to [[Galesburg, Illinois]], to play for a spot on a minor league baseball team, the [[Galesburg Pavers]] of the [[Central Association]].<ref>Carroll, p. 11.</ref> Rice spent about a week with the team, appearing in three exhibition games. In an appearance on April 21, Rice entered the game as a relief pitcher and finished the last three innings of a Pavers victory, giving up one run in a game marked by forceful winds.<ref>Carroll, pp. 11-12.</ref>\n\nThat same day, Rice's wife took their children on a day trip to the homestead of Rice's parents in Morocco, about 20 miles from Watseka. A storm arose and a tornado swept across the homestead, destroying the house and most of the outbuildings. The tornado killed Rice's wife, his two children, his mother, his two younger sisters and a farmhand. Rice's father survived for another week before also succumbing to his injuries. Rice had to attend two funerals: one for his parents and sisters, and a second for his wife and children.<ref>Carroll, pp. 12-15.</ref>\n\nRice played for the [[Muscatine Muskies]] of the Central Association in 1912, hitting .194 in 18 games. He did not play in 1913.<ref>https://www.baseball-reference.com/register/player.fcgi?id=rice--001edg</ref>\n\n==Early baseball career==\nProbably wracked with grief, Rice spent the next year wandering the area and working at several jobs. In 1913, he joined the [[United States Navy]] and served on the {{USS|New Hampshire|BB-25|6}}, a 16,000-ton battleship that was large enough to field a baseball team. Rice played on that team during one season.<ref>''Red, White & True''</ref> He was on the ship when it took part in the [[United States occupation of Veracruz]], Mexico.\n\nIn 1914, Rice joined the [[Petersburg Goobers]] of the [[Virginia League]] as a pitcher.

When Jung-hyun attempts to carry the chairman out of the house, a fire is started and Jung-hyun is knocked out. After the evidence points to Jung-hyun as the main suspect, he is sentenced to life imprisonment. To give her son a chance to get out of jail and prove his innocence, his mother kills herself.

In 1909, he cofounded the ''Liberale Volksbond'' of the district Brussels.

After the war this remained the program for the ''Vlaams-Belgisch Verbond''.\n\nAfter the war Hoste took over the management of the publishing company, and ''Het Laatste Nieuws'' became the most popular newspaper in Flanders. The success of the newspaper stood in strong contrast to the bad results for the liberals in Brussels in the elections of 1920.

While he was in office, he founded the [[Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie van Belgi\u00eb voor Wetenschappen en Kunsten|Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie voor Wetenschappen, Letteren en Schone Kunsten]] and a Dutch and French ''cultural council'' (1938).\n\nDuring [[World War II]] he stayed in [[Great Britain]], where he became the under-secretary for education in the Belgian government in exile. After the war, he helped reestablish the ''Liberale Volksbond'' and the [[Liberaal Vlaams Verbond]]. In 1947, he was one of the main authors of the [[Oxford Manifesto]] on liberalism. In 1949 he was chosen as liberal [[Senate of Belgium|senator]] for Brussels, which he remained until his death in 1954.
