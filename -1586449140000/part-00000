NGA provides governors and their senior staff members with services that range from representing states on [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] and at the [[White House]] when discussing federal issues to developing policy reports on state programs and hosting [[social network|networking]] [[seminar]]s for state [[executive (government)|executive branch]] officials. The NGA Center for Best Practices focuses on state innovations and [[best practices]] on issues that range from [[education]] and [[public health|health]] to [[technology]], [[welfare reform]], and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. NGA also provides [[management]] and technical assistance to both new and [[incumbent]] governors.\n\nNGA adopted a policy in 1977 formalizing its standard practice dating back to 1941: The position of NGA [[Chairman|chair]] alternates yearly between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governors, so that neither party can control the position for two consecutive years. The vice chair is usually of the opposite party to the chair, and generally assumes the role of NGA chair the following year. The current NGA chair is [[List of Governors of Maryland|Governor]] [[Larry Hogan]] of [[Maryland]], a Republican. The vice chair is [[List of Governors of New York|Governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], a Democrat.\n\n[[Arkansas]]' [[Bill Clinton]] is, to date, the only former chair of the organization to become [[president of the United States]].

NGA provides governors and their senior staff members with services that range from representing states on [[Capitol Hill, Washington, D.C.|Capitol Hill]] and at the [[White House]] when discussing federal issues to developing policy reports on state programs and hosting [[social network|networking]] [[seminar]]s for state [[executive (government)|executive branch]] officials. The NGA Center for Best Practices focuses on state innovations and [[best practices]] on issues that range from [[education]] and [[public health|health]] to [[technology]], [[welfare reform]], and the [[Natural environment|environment]]. NGA also provides [[management]] and technical assistance to both new and [[incumbent]] governors.\n\nNGA adopted a policy in 1977 formalizing its standard practice dating back to 1941: The position of NGA [[Chairman|chair]] alternates yearly between [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governors, so that neither party can control the position for two consecutive years. The vice chair is usually of the opposite party to the chair, and generally assumes the role of NGA chair the following year. The current NGA chair is [[List of Governors of Maryland|Governor]] [[Larry Hogan]] of [[Maryland]], a Republican. The vice chair is [[List of Governors of New York|Governor]] [[Andrew Cuomo]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], a Democrat.\n\n[[Arkansas]]' [[Bill Clinton]] is, to date, the only former chair of the organization to become [[president of the United States]]. [[Janet Napolitano]] of [[Arizona]] became the first female chair in 2006.\n\nIn February 2020, [[Mike Pompeo]] warned the National Governors Association that the [[Communist Party of China]] was actively attempting to influence U.S. policy through state governors and local officials.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Allen-Ebrahimian|first=Bethany|url=https://www.axios.com/china-rating-us-governors-bff6cc73-e485-44f2-98d0-b7639af3f0aa.html|title=How a Chinese think tank rates all 50 U.S. governors|date=February 19, 2020|work=[[Axios (website)|Axios]]|access-date=February 19, 2020|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Chairs==\nFormally adopted as policy in 1977, chairs preside for a one-year term and alternate party affiliation, so the same party never serves for two terms in a row.<ref name=\"GovsTime\">{{cite web |url=http://www.subnet.nga.org/centennial/timeline/ |title=Historical Timeline |publisher=National Governors Association Centennial |accessdate=2008-10-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121004103801/http://www.subnet.nga.org/centennial/timeline/ |archivedate=2012-10-04 }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Years\n!Chair\n!State\n!Party\n|- bgcolor=#FFE8E8\n|1908\u20131911\n|[[Augustus E.

This practice is similar to many developing countries, but different from developed countries such as the United States who adjusts their poverty line on an incremental basis per additional household member. For example, in the United States, the poverty line for a household with just one member was set at $11,670 per year for 2014, while it was set at $23,850 per year for a 4-member household (or $5963 per person for the larger household).<ref name=hhspovline>[http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/14poverty.cfm 2014 Poverty Guidelines] US Department of Health and Human Services (2014)</ref> The rationale for the differences arise from the economic realities of each country. In India, households may include surviving grandparents, parents, and children. They typically do not incur any or significant rent expenses every month particularly in rural India, unlike housing in mostly urban developed economies. The cost of food and other essentials are shared within the household by its members in both cases. However, a larger portion of a monthly expenditure goes to food in poor households in developing countries,<ref>[http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/food-security-poverty.pdf Food Security and Poverty in Asia and the Pacific] Asian Development Bank (April 2012), {{ISBN|978-92-9092-666-5}}, pp. 9-11.</ref> while housing, conveyance, and other essentials cost significantly more in developed economies.\n\nFor its current poverty rate measurements, India calculates two benchmarks. The first includes a basket of goods, including food items but excluding the implied value of home, value of any means of conveyance or the economic value of other essentials created, grown or used without a financial transaction, by the members of a household. The second poverty line benchmark adds rent value of residence as well as the cost of conveyance, but nothing else, to the first benchmark.<ref name=povmethod2009>[http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_pov.pdf REPORT OF THE EXPERT GROUP TO REVIEW THE METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATION OF POVERTY] Govt of India (2009), pp. 11-27.</ref> This practice is similar to those used in developed countries for non-cash income equivalents and  a poverty line basis.<ref>Gordon Fisher, [http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v55n4/v55n4p3.pdf The Development and the history of poverty thresholds] Social Security Bulletin, Vol 55, No 4 (Winter 1992), US Government, pp. 9.</ref><ref>Smeeding et al., [http://www.iariw.org/kendrickprizepdfs/1993-2-Smeeding-et-al.pdf POVERTY, INEQUALTTY, AND FAMILY LIVING STANDARDS IMPACTS ACROSS SEVEN NATIONS: THE EFFECT OF NONCASH SUBSIDIES FOR HEALTH, EDUCATION AND HOUSING] Review of Income and Wealth, Series 39, Number 3.

This was revised in 1993, and the absolute poverty line was set at $1.08 a day for all countries on a [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) basis, after adjusting for inflation to the 1993 US dollar.

According to this revised World Bank methodology, India had 179.6 million people below the new poverty line, China had 137.6 million, and the world had 872.3 million people below the new poverty line on an equivalent basis as of 2013.

These are in addition to the earlier poverty line of $1.90 per day. The new lines are supposed to serve two purposes. One, they account for the fact that achieving the same set of capabilities may need a different set of goods and services in different countries and, specifically, a costlier set in richer countries. Second, they allow for cross-country comparisons and benchmarking both within and across developing regions. India falls in the lower middle-income category. Using the $3.20 per day poverty line, the percentage of the population living in poverty in India (2011) was 60%. This means that 763 million people in India were living below this poverty line in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n====Semi-economic measures of poverty====\nOther measures such as the semi-economic [[Multi-dimensional Poverty Index]] (MPI), which places 33% weight on education and number of schooling years in its definition of poverty, and places 6.25% weight on income and assets owned, suggests there were 650 million people (53.7% of population) living in MPI-poverty in India.<ref name=ophimpi>{{cite web|url=http://www.ophi.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/India.pdf?cda6c1|work=Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative|title=Country Briefing: India, Multidimensional Poverty Index (MPI) At a Glance|accessdate=16 August 2017}}</ref> 421 million of MPI-defined poor are concentrated in eight [[North India]]n and [[East India]]n states of Bihar, [[Chhattisgarh]], Jharkhand, [[Madhya Pradesh]], [[Odisha|Orissa]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[West Bengal]].

This practice is similar to many developing countries, but different from developed countries such as the United States who adjusts their poverty line on an incremental basis per additional household member. For example, in the United States, the poverty line for a household with just one member was set at $11,670 per year for 2014, while it was set at $23,850 per year for a 4-member household (or $5963 per person for the larger household).<ref name=hhspovline>[http://aspe.hhs.gov/poverty/14poverty.cfm 2014 Poverty Guidelines] US Department of Health and Human Services (2014)</ref> The rationale for the differences arise from the economic realities of each country. In India, households may include surviving grandparents, parents, and children. They typically do not incur any or significant rent expenses every month particularly in rural India, unlike housing in mostly urban developed economies. The cost of food and other essentials are shared within the household by its members in both cases. However, a larger portion of a monthly expenditure goes to food in poor households in developing countries,<ref>[http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/food-security-poverty.pdf Food Security and Poverty in Asia and the Pacific] Asian Development Bank (April 2012), {{ISBN|978-92-9092-666-5}}, pp. 9-11.</ref> while housing, conveyance, and other essentials cost significantly more in developed economies.\n\nFor its current poverty rate measurements, India calculates two benchmarks. The first includes a basket of goods, including food items but excluding the implied value of home, value of any means of conveyance or the economic value of other essentials created, grown or used without a financial transaction, by the members of a household. The second poverty line benchmark adds rent value of residence as well as the cost of conveyance, but nothing else, to the first benchmark.<ref name=povmethod2009>[http://planningcommission.nic.in/reports/genrep/rep_pov.pdf REPORT OF THE EXPERT GROUP TO REVIEW THE METHODOLOGY FOR ESTIMATION OF POVERTY] Govt of India (2009), pp. 11-27.</ref> This practice is similar to those used in developed countries for non-cash income equivalents and  a poverty line basis.<ref>Gordon Fisher, [http://www.ssa.gov/policy/docs/ssb/v55n4/v55n4p3.pdf The Development and the history of poverty thresholds] Social Security Bulletin, Vol 55, No 4 (Winter 1992), US Government, pp. 9.</ref><ref>Smeeding et al., [http://www.iariw.org/kendrickprizepdfs/1993-2-Smeeding-et-al.pdf POVERTY, INEQUALTTY, AND FAMILY LIVING STANDARDS IMPACTS ACROSS SEVEN NATIONS: THE EFFECT OF NONCASH SUBSIDIES FOR HEALTH, EDUCATION AND HOUSING] Review of Income and Wealth, Series 39, Number 3.

These are in addition to the earlier poverty line of $1.90 per day. The new lines are supposed to serve two purposes. One, they account for the fact that achieving the same set of capabilities may need a different set of goods and services in different countries and, specifically, a costlier set in richer countries. Second, they allow for cross-country comparisons and benchmarking both within and across developing regions. India falls in the lower middle-income category. Using the $3.20 per day poverty line, the percentage of the population living in poverty in India (2011) was 60%.

The boat is allowed to drift to present a more natural bait. Swordfishing requires strong fishing rods and reels, as swordfish can become quite large, and it is not uncommon to use five pounds or more of weight to get the baits deep enough during the day, up to 1,500&nbsp;feet is common.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fishingbooker.com/blog/proven-daytime-swordfish-tactics|title=Daytime Swordfish Tactics That Work Like a Charm|work=FishingBooker.com|date=2018-10-13}}</ref> Night fishing baits are usually fished much shallower, often less than {{convert|90|m}}.
