(He would retire in 1914.)  From 1904 to 1911 the [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res]] company led the world in film production and distribution.<ref name=\"Town 1914\" />\n\nAt Gaumont, pioneer [[Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9]] (M. Gaumont's former secretary) was made head of production and oversaw about 400 films, from her first, ''[[La F\u00e9e aux Choux]]'', in 1896, through 1906.  She then continued her career in the United States, as did [[Maurice Tourneur]] and [[L\u00e9once Perret]] after World War I.\n\nIn 1907 Gaumont owned and operated the biggest movie studio in the world, and along with the boom in construction of \"luxury cinemas\" like the Gaumont-Palace and the Path\u00e9-Palace (both 1911), cinema became an economic challenger to legitimate theater by 1914.<ref name=\"Town 1914\" />\n\n=== After World War I ===\nAfter World War I, the French film industry suffered because of a lack of capital, and film production decreased as it did in most other European countries. This allowed the United States film industry to enter the European cinema market, because American films could be sold more cheaply than European productions, since the studios already had recouped their costs in the home market. When film studios in Europe began to fail, many European countries began to set import barriers. France installed an import quota of 1:7, meaning for every seven foreign films imported to France, one French film was to be produced and shown in French cinemas.<ref>L'Estrange Fawcett: Die Welt des Films. Amalthea-Verlag, Z\u00fcrich, Leipzig, Wien 1928, p. 149 (German translation of Fawcett's book of 1928: ''Film, Facts and Forecasts'')</ref>\n\nDuring the period between World War I and World War II, [[Jacques Feyder]] and [[Jean Vigo]] became two of the founders of [[poetic realism]] in French cinema. They also dominated [[French impressionist cinema]], along with [[Abel Gance]], [[Germaine Dulac]] and [[Jean Epstein]].\n\nIn 1931, [[Marcel Pagnol]] filmed the first of his great trilogy ''[[Marius (1931 film)|Marius]]'', ''Fanny'', and ''C\u00e9sar''. He followed this with other films including ''[[The Baker's Wife (film)|The Baker's Wife]]''. Other notable films of the 1930s included [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]]'s ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris]]'' (1930), Jean Vigo's ''[[L'Atalante]]'' (1934), Jacques Feyder's ''[[Carnival in Flanders (film)|Carnival in Flanders]]'' (1935), and [[Julien Duvivier]]'s ''La belle equipe'' (1936). In 1935, renowned playwright and actor [[Sacha Guitry]] directed his first film and went on to make more than 30 films that were precursors to the [[French New Wave|New Wave]] era. In 1937, [[Jean Renoir]], the son of painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], directed ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' (''The Grand Illusion''). In 1939, Renoir directed ''[[The Rules of the Game|La R\u00e8gle du Jeu]]'' (''The Rules of the Game'').  Several critics have cited this film as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest of all-time]], particularly for its innovative camerawork, cinematography and sound editing.\n\n[[Marcel Carn\u00e9]]'s ''[[Children of Paradise|Les Enfants du Paradis]]'' (''Children of Paradise'') was filmed during World War II and released in 1945. The three-hour film was extremely difficult to make due to the [[Nazi occupation of France|Nazi occupation]]. Set in Paris in 1828, it was voted Best French Film of the Century in a poll of 600 French critics and professionals in the late [[1990s in film|1990s]].\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\n\n==== 1940s\u20131970s ====\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Alain Delon in Belgrade, 1962 (1).JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Alain Delon]] was known as much for his beauty as for his acting career and holds an enduring status as a leading man in French cinema.]]\nIn the magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', founded by [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]] and two other writers in 1951, film critics raised the level of discussion of the cinema, providing a platform for the birth of modern [[film theory]].  Several of the ''Cahiers'' critics, including [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Jacques Rivette]] and [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]], went on to make films themselves, creating what was to become known as the [[French New Wave]]. Some of the first films of this new movement were Godard's ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' (''\u00c0 bout de souffle'', 1960), starring [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], Rivette's ''[[Paris Belongs to Us]]'' (''Paris nous appartient'', 1958 \u2013 distributed in 1961), starring [[Jean-Claude Brialy]] and Truffaut's ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (''Les Quatre Cent Coups'', 1959) starring [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]].\n\nMany contemporaries of Godard and Truffaut followed suit, or achieved international critical acclaim with styles of their own, such as the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] films of [[Robert Bresson]] and [[Jean-Pierre Melville]], the Hitchcockian-like thrillers of [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]], and other New Wave films by [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] and [[Alain Resnais]]. The movement, while an inspiration to other national cinemas and unmistakably a direct influence on the future [[New Hollywood]] directors, slowly faded by the end of the 1960s.\n\n[[File:Brigitte Bardot - 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Brigitte Bardot]] was one of the most famous French actresses in the 1960s.]]\n[[File:Leslie Caron - Maruice Chevalier - 1957.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The French actress [[Leslie Caron]] with [[Maurice Chevalier]] on the set of ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958).]]\nDuring this period, French commercial film also made a name for itself. Immensely popular French comedies with [[Louis de Fun\u00e8s]] topped the French box office. The war comedy ''[[La Grande Vadrouille]]'' (1966), from [[G\u00e9rard Oury]] with [[Bourvil]] and [[Terry-Thomas]], was the most successful film in French theaters for more than 30 years. Another example was ''[[Delusions of Grandeur (film)|La Folie des grandeurs]]'' with [[Yves Montand]]. French cinema also was the birthplace for many subgenres of the [[crime film]], most notably the modern [[caper film]], starting with 1955's ''[[Rififi]]'' by American-born director [[Jules Dassin]] and followed by a large number of serious, noirish heist dramas as well as playful caper comedies throughout the sixties, and the \"polar,\" a typical French blend of [[film noir]] and [[detective fiction]]. In addition, French movie stars began to claim fame abroad as well as at home. Popular actors of the period included [[Brigitte Bardot]], [[Alain Delon]], [[Romy Schneider]], [[Catherine Deneuve]], [[Jeanne Moreau]], [[Simone Signoret]], [[Yves Montand]], [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]] and [[Jean Gabin]]. Since the Sixties and Seventies they are completed and followed by [[Michel Piccoli]], [[Philippe Noiret]], [[Annie Girardot]], [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]], [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]], [[Claude Jade]], [[Isabelle Huppert]], [[Anny Duperey]], [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], [[Patrick Dewaere]], [[Jean-Pierre Cassel]], [[Miou-Miou]], [[Brigitte Fossey]], [[St\u00e9phane Audran]] and [[Isabelle Adjani]].\n\nThe 1979 film ''[[La Cage aux Folles (film)|La Cage aux Folles]]'' ran for well over a year at the [[Paris Theatre]], an [[arthouse cinema]] in New York City, and was a commercial success at theaters throughout the country, in both urban and rural areas. It won the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], and for years it remained the most successful foreign film to be released in the United States.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=foreign.htm |title=Foreign Languages Movies |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=19 April 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100724001435/http://www.boxofficemojo.com/genres/chart/?id=foreign.htm |archivedate=24 July 2010 }}</ref>\n[[File:DARRIEUX Danielle-24x30-2008b.jpg|thumb|right|[[Danielle Darrieux]] (pictured in 2008) was a French centenarian,  who had one of the longest careers in French cinema, spanning eight decades]]\n\n==== 1980s ====\n[[Jean-Jacques Beineix]]'s ''[[Diva (1981 film)|Diva]]'' (1981) sparked the beginning of the 1980s wave of French cinema.

These films, made with a slick commercial style and emphasizing the alienation of their main characters, was known as [[Cinema du look]].\n\n''[[Camille Claudel (film)|Camille Claudel]]'', directed by newcomer [[Bruno Nuytten]] and starring [[Isabelle Adjani]] and [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], was a major commercial success in 1988, earning Adjani, who was also the film's co-producer, a [[C\u00e9sar Award]] for best actress. The [[historical fiction|historical drama]] film ''[[Jean de Florette]]'' (1986) and its sequel ''[[Manon des Sources (1986 film)|Manon des Sources]]'' (1986) were among the highest grossing French films in history and brought Daniel Auteuil international recognition.\n\nAccording to [[Rapha\u00ebl Bassan]], in his article \u00ab''[[The Angel (1982 film)|The Angel]]'': Un m\u00e9t\u00e9ore dans le ciel de l'animation,\u00bb ''La Revue du cin\u00e9ma'', n\u00b0 393, avril 1984. {{in lang|fr}}, [[Patrick Bokanowski]]'s ''[[The Angel (1982 film)|The Angel]]'', shown in [[1982 in film|1982]] at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], can be considered the beginnings of contemporary animation. The masks erase all human personality in the characters. [[Patrick Bokanowski]] would thus have total control over the \"matter\" of the image and its optical composition. This is especially noticeable throughout the film, with images taken through distorted objectives or a plastic work on the sets and costumes, for example in the scene of the designer. [[Patrick Bokanowski]] creates his own universe and obeys his own aesthetic logic. It takes us through a series of distorted areas, obscure visions, metamorphoses and synthetic objects. Indeed, in the film, the human may be viewed as a fetish object (for example, the doll hanging by a thread), with reference to [[Franz Kafka#\"Kafkaesque\"|Kafkaesque]] and [[Siegmund Freud|Freudian]] theories on [[automaton|automata]] and the fear of man faced with something as complex as him. The ascent of the stairs would be the liberation of the ideas of death, culture, and sex that makes us reach the emblematic figure of the angel.\n\n==== 1990s ====\n[[File:Palmed'or.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palme d'Or]] (\"Golden Palm\"), the most prestigious award given out at [[Cannes Film Festival]].]]\nJean-Paul Rappeneau's ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (1990 film)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' was a major box-office success in 1990, earning several [[C\u00e9sar Award]]s, including best actor for [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], as well as an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for best foreign picture.\n\n[[Luc Besson]] made ''[[La Femme Nikita (film)|La Femme Nikita]]'' in 1990, a movie that inspired remakes in both United States and in Hong Kong.

[[Mathieu Kassovitz]]'s 1995 film ''Hate'' (''[[La Haine]]'') received critical praise and made [[Vincent Cassel]] a star, and in 1997, [[Juliette Binoche]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''.\n\nThe success of [[Michel Ocelot]]'s ''[[Kirikou and the Sorceress]]'' in 1998 rejuvenated the production of original feature-length animated films by such filmmakers as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Laguionie]] and [[Sylvain Chomet]].\n\n==== 2000s ====\n[[File:Texas Instruments, DLP Cinema Prototype System, Mark V, Paris, 2000 - Philippe Binant Archives.jpg|thumb|First [[digital cinema]] projection in Paris with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]] (2000).]]\nIn 2000, Philippe Binant realized the first [[digital cinema]] projection in [[Europe]], with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]], in Paris.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"google.com\"/>\n\nIn 2001, after a brief stint in Hollywood, [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] returned to France with ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (''Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain'') starring [[Audrey Tautou]].

The following year, ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' became the second-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States since 1980 and went on to gross more than $70 million worldwide.\n\nIn 2008, [[Marion Cotillard]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for her portrayal of legendary French singer [[\u00c9dith Piaf]] in ''[[La Vie en Rose (film)|La Vie en Rose]]'', the first French-language performance to be so honored. The film won two Oscars and four [[BAFTA]]s and became the third-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States since 1980. Cotillard was the first female and second person to win both an Academy Award and [[C\u00e9sar Award]] for the same performance.\n\nAt the 2008 [[Cannes Film Festival]], ''[[Entre les murs]]'' (''The Class'') won the [[Palme d'Or]], the 6th French victory at the festival. The 2000s also saw an increase in the number of individual competitive awards won by French artists at the Cannes Festival, for [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|direction]] ([[Tony Gatlif]], ''[[Exils]]'', 2004), [[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|screenplay]] ([[Agn\u00e8s Jaoui]] and [[Jean-Pierre Bacri]], ''[[Look at Me (film)|Look at Me]]'', 2004), [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|female acting]] ([[Isabelle Huppert]], ''[[The Piano Teacher (film)|The Piano Teacher]]'', 2001; [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]], ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'', 2009) and male acting ([[Jamel Debbouze]], [[Samy Naceri]], [[Roschdy Zem]], [[Sami Bouajila]] and [[Bernard Blancan]], ''[[Days of Glory (2006 film)|Days of Glory]]'', 2006).\n\nThe 2008 rural comedy ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]'' drew an audience of more than 20 million, the first French film to do so. Its $193 million gross in France puts it just behind ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' as the most successful film of all time in French theaters.\n\nIn the 2000s, several French directors made international productions, often in the action genre. These include [[G\u00e9rard Pir\u00e8s]] (''[[Steal (film)|Riders]]'', 2002), [[Pitof]] (''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'', 2004), [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet]] (''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (2005 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'', 2005), [[Florent Emilio Siri]] (''[[Hostage (2005 film)|Hostage]]'', 2005), [[Christophe Gans]] (''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'', 2006), [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] (''[[Babylon A.D.]]'', 2008), [[Louis Leterrier]] (''[[The Transporter]]'', 2002; ''[[Transporter 2]]'', 2005; [[Olivier Megaton]] directed ''[[Transporter 3]]'', 2008), [[Alexandre Aja]] (''[[Mirrors (film)|Mirrors]]'', 2008), and [[Pierre Morel]] (''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]'', 2009).\n\nSurveying the entire range of French filmmaking today, Tim Palmer calls contemporary cinema in France a kind of eco-system, in which commercial cinema co-exists with artistic radicalism, first-time directors (who make up about 40% of all France's directors each year) mingle with veterans, and there even occasionally emerges a fascinating pop-art hybridity, in which the features of intellectual and mass cinemas are interrelated (as in filmmakers like Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, Olivier Assayas, Ma\u00efwenn, Sophie Filli\u00e8res, Serge Bozon, and others).<ref>Palmer, Tim (2011).

The French cinema market, and more generally the French-speaking market, is smaller than the English-speaking market; one reason being that some major markets, including prominently the United States, are reluctant to generally accept foreign films, especially foreign-language and subtitled productions.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/movies/22kauf.html|title= Is Foreign Film the New Endangered Species?|author= Anthony Kaufman|date= 22 January 2006|work= The New York Times|accessdate= 3 June 2011|url-status= live|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120329230925/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/22/movies/22kauf.html|archivedate= 29 March 2012}}</ref> As a consequence, French movies have to be amortized on a relatively small market and thus generally have budgets far lower than their American counterparts, ruling out expensive settings and [[special effect]]s.\n\nThe French government has implemented various measures aimed at supporting local film production and movie theaters. The [[Canal+]] TV channel has a broadcast license requiring it to support the production of movies. Some taxes are levied on movies and TV channels for use as subsidies for movie production. Some tax breaks are given for investment in movie productions, as is common elsewhere [[Movie production incentives in the United States|including in the United States]]. The sale of DVDs is prohibited for four months after the showing in theaters, so as to ensure some revenue for movie theaters. Recently, Messerlin and Parc (2014, 2017) described the effect of subsidies in the French film industry.<ref>[http://gem.sciences-po.fr/content/publications/pdf/audiovisual/Messerlin_Parc_ScreenQuotas&Subisies122014.pdf Messerlin, P. and Parc, J.

For this reason, French cinema is sometimes intertwined with the cinema of foreign nations. Directors from nations such as [[Poland]] ([[Roman Polanski]], [[Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski]], and [[Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski]]), [[Argentina]] ([[Gaspar No\u00e9]] and [[Edgardo Cozarinsky]]), [[Russia]] ([[Alexandre Alexeieff]], [[Anatole Litvak]]), Austria ([[Michael Haneke]]), and [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] ([[G\u00e9la Babluani]], [[Otar Iosseliani]]) are prominent in the ranks of French cinema. Conversely, French directors have had prolific and influential careers in other countries, such as [[Luc Besson]], [[Jacques Tourneur]], or [[Francis Veber]] in the [[Cinema of the United States|United States]].\n\nAnother element supporting this fact is that [[Paris]] has the highest density of cinemas in the world, measured by the  number of [[movie theaters]] per inhabitant,<ref>[http://old.campusfrance.org/en/a-etudier/faq.htm 20 questions about studying in France] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110504080519/http://old.campusfrance.org/en/a-etudier/faq.htm |date=2011-05-04 }}</ref> and that in most \"downtown Paris\" movie theaters, foreign movies which would be secluded to \"art houses\" cinemas in other places are shown alongside \"mainstream\" works.

[[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re]] invented the [[cin\u00e9matographe]] and their ''[[L'Arriv\u00e9e d'un train en gare de La Ciotat]]'' in Paris in 1895 is considered by many historians as the official birth of cinematography.\n\nThe early days of the industry, from 1896 to 1902, saw the dominance of four firms:  [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res]], the [[Gaumont Film Company]], the [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] company, and [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|the Lumi\u00e8res]].<ref name=\"Town 1914\">The Cin\u00e9 Goes to Town:  French Cinema 1896\u20131914, Richard Abel</ref>  M\u00e9li\u00e8s invented many of the techniques of cinematic grammar, and among his fantastic, surreal short subjects is the first [[science fiction film]] ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' (''Le Voyage dans la Lune'') in 1902).\n\nIn 1902 [[Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re|the Lumi\u00e8res]] abandoned everything but the production of film stock, leaving M\u00e9li\u00e8s as the weakest player of the remaining three.  (He would retire in 1914.)  From 1904 to 1911 the [[Path\u00e9 Fr\u00e8res]] company led the world in film production and distribution.<ref name=\"Town 1914\" />\n\nAt Gaumont, pioneer [[Alice Guy-Blach\u00e9]] (M. Gaumont's former secretary) was made head of production and oversaw about 400 films, from her first, ''[[La F\u00e9e aux Choux]]'', in 1896, through 1906.  She then continued her career in the United States, as did [[Maurice Tourneur]] and [[L\u00e9once Perret]] after World War I.\n\nIn 1907 Gaumont owned and operated the biggest movie studio in the world, and along with the boom in construction of \"luxury cinemas\" like the Gaumont-Palace and the Path\u00e9-Palace (both 1911), cinema became an economic challenger to legitimate theater by 1914.<ref name=\"Town 1914\" />\n\n=== After World War I ===\nAfter World War I, the French film industry suffered because of a lack of capital, and film production decreased as it did in most other European countries. This allowed the United States film industry to enter the European cinema market, because American films could be sold more cheaply than European productions, since the studios already had recouped their costs in the home market. When film studios in Europe began to fail, many European countries began to set import barriers. France installed an import quota of 1:7, meaning for every seven foreign films imported to France, one French film was to be produced and shown in French cinemas.<ref>L'Estrange Fawcett: Die Welt des Films. Amalthea-Verlag, Z\u00fcrich, Leipzig, Wien 1928, p. 149 (German translation of Fawcett's book of 1928: ''Film, Facts and Forecasts'')</ref>\n\nDuring the period between World War I and World War II, [[Jacques Feyder]] and [[Jean Vigo]] became two of the founders of [[poetic realism]] in French cinema. They also dominated [[French impressionist cinema]], along with [[Abel Gance]], [[Germaine Dulac]] and [[Jean Epstein]].\n\nIn 1931, [[Marcel Pagnol]] filmed the first of his great trilogy ''[[Marius (1931 film)|Marius]]'', ''Fanny'', and ''C\u00e9sar''. He followed this with other films including ''[[The Baker's Wife (film)|The Baker's Wife]]''. Other notable films of the 1930s included [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]]'s ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris]]'' (1930), Jean Vigo's ''[[L'Atalante]]'' (1934), Jacques Feyder's ''[[Carnival in Flanders (film)|Carnival in Flanders]]'' (1935), and [[Julien Duvivier]]'s ''La belle equipe'' (1936). In 1935, renowned playwright and actor [[Sacha Guitry]] directed his first film and went on to make more than 30 films that were precursors to the [[French New Wave|New Wave]] era. In 1937, [[Jean Renoir]], the son of painter [[Pierre-Auguste Renoir]], directed ''[[La Grande Illusion]]'' (''The Grand Illusion''). In 1939, Renoir directed ''[[The Rules of the Game|La R\u00e8gle du Jeu]]'' (''The Rules of the Game'').  Several critics have cited this film as one of the [[List of films considered the best|greatest of all-time]], particularly for its innovative camerawork, cinematography and sound editing.\n\n[[Marcel Carn\u00e9]]'s ''[[Children of Paradise|Les Enfants du Paradis]]'' (''Children of Paradise'') was filmed during World War II and released in 1945. The three-hour film was extremely difficult to make due to the [[Nazi occupation of France|Nazi occupation]]. Set in Paris in 1828, it was voted Best French Film of the Century in a poll of 600 French critics and professionals in the late [[1990s in film|1990s]].\n\n=== Post\u2013World War II ===\n\n==== 1940s\u20131970s ====\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Alain Delon in Belgrade, 1962 (1).JPG|thumb|right|upright|[[Alain Delon]] was known as much for his beauty as for his acting career and holds an enduring status as a leading man in French cinema.]]\nIn the magazine ''[[Cahiers du cin\u00e9ma]]'', founded by [[Andr\u00e9 Bazin]] and two other writers in 1951, film critics raised the level of discussion of the cinema, providing a platform for the birth of modern [[film theory]].  Several of the ''Cahiers'' critics, including [[Jean-Luc Godard]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]], [[Claude Chabrol]], [[Jacques Rivette]] and [[\u00c9ric Rohmer]], went on to make films themselves, creating what was to become known as the [[French New Wave]]. Some of the first films of this new movement were Godard's ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' (''\u00c0 bout de souffle'', 1960), starring [[Jean-Paul Belmondo]], Rivette's ''[[Paris Belongs to Us]]'' (''Paris nous appartient'', 1958 \u2013 distributed in 1961), starring [[Jean-Claude Brialy]] and Truffaut's ''[[The 400 Blows]]'' (''Les Quatre Cent Coups'', 1959) starring [[Jean-Pierre L\u00e9aud]]. \n\nMany contemporaries of Godard and Truffaut followed suit, or achieved international critical acclaim with styles of their own, such as the [[Minimalism|minimalist]] films of [[Robert Bresson]] and [[Jean-Pierre Melville]], the Hitchcockian-like thrillers of [[Henri-Georges Clouzot]], and other New Wave films by [[Agn\u00e8s Varda]] and [[Alain Resnais]]. The movement, while an inspiration to other national cinemas and unmistakably a direct influence on the future [[New Hollywood]] directors, slowly faded by the end of the 1960s.\n\n[[File:Brigitte Bardot - 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Brigitte Bardot]] was one of the most famous French actresses in the 1960s.]]\n[[File:Leslie Caron - Maruice Chevalier - 1957.jpg|upright|thumb|right|The French actress [[Leslie Caron]] with [[Maurice Chevalier]] on the set of ''[[Gigi (1958 film)|Gigi]]'' (1958).]]\nDuring this period, French commercial film also made a name for itself. Immensely popular French comedies with [[Louis de Fun\u00e8s]] topped the French box office. The war comedy ''[[La Grande Vadrouille]]'' (1966), from [[G\u00e9rard Oury]] with [[Bourvil]] and [[Terry-Thomas]], was the most successful film in French theaters for more than 30 years. Another example was ''[[Delusions of Grandeur (film)|La Folie des grandeurs]]'' with [[Yves Montand]]. French cinema also was the birthplace for many subgenres of the [[crime film]], most notably the modern [[caper film]], starting with 1955's ''[[Rififi]]'' by American-born director [[Jules Dassin]] and followed by a large number of serious, noirish heist dramas as well as playful caper comedies throughout the sixties, and the \"polar,\" a typical French blend of [[film noir]] and [[detective fiction]]. In addition, French movie stars began to claim fame abroad as well as at home.

Movies which followed in its wake included ''[[Betty Blue]]'' (''37\u00b02 le matin'', 1986) by Beineix, ''[[The Big Blue]]'' (''Le Grand bleu'', 1988) by [[Luc Besson]], and ''[[The Lovers on the Bridge]]'' (''Les Amants du Pont-Neuf'', 1991) by [[L\u00e9os Carax]]. These films, made with a slick commercial style and emphasizing the alienation of their main characters, was known as [[Cinema du look]].\n\n''[[Camille Claudel (film)|Camille Claudel]]'', directed by newcomer [[Bruno Nuytten]] and starring [[Isabelle Adjani]] and [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], was a major commercial success in 1988, earning Adjani, who was also the film's co-producer, a [[C\u00e9sar Award]] for best actress. The [[historical fiction|historical drama]] film ''[[Jean de Florette]]'' (1986) and its sequel ''[[Manon des Sources (1986 film)|Manon des Sources]]'' (1986) were among the highest grossing French films in history and brought Daniel Auteuil international recognition.\n\nAccording to [[Rapha\u00ebl Bassan]], in his article \u00ab''[[The Angel (1982 film)|The Angel]]'': Un m\u00e9t\u00e9ore dans le ciel de l'animation,\u00bb ''La Revue du cin\u00e9ma'', n\u00b0 393, avril 1984. {{in lang|fr}}, [[Patrick Bokanowski]]'s ''[[The Angel (1982 film)|The Angel]]'', shown in [[1982 in film|1982]] at the [[1982 Cannes Film Festival|Cannes Film Festival]], can be considered the beginnings of contemporary animation. The masks erase all human personality in the characters. [[Patrick Bokanowski]] would thus have total control over the \"matter\" of the image and its optical composition. This is especially noticeable throughout the film, with images taken through distorted objectives or a plastic work on the sets and costumes, for example in the scene of the designer. [[Patrick Bokanowski]] creates his own universe and obeys his own aesthetic logic. It takes us through a series of distorted areas, obscure visions, metamorphoses and synthetic objects. Indeed, in the film, the human may be viewed as a fetish object (for example, the doll hanging by a thread), with reference to [[Franz Kafka#\"Kafkaesque\"|Kafkaesque]] and [[Siegmund Freud|Freudian]] theories on [[automaton|automata]] and the fear of man faced with something as complex as him. The ascent of the stairs would be the liberation of the ideas of death, culture, and sex that makes us reach the emblematic figure of the angel.\n\n==== 1990s ====\n[[File:Palmed'or.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Palme d'Or]] (\"Golden Palm\"), the most prestigious award given out at [[Cannes Film Festival]].]]\nJean-Paul Rappeneau's ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (1990 film)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' was a major box-office success in 1990, earning several [[C\u00e9sar Award]]s, including best actor for [[G\u00e9rard Depardieu]], as well as an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for best foreign picture.\n\n[[Luc Besson]] made ''[[La Femme Nikita (film)|La Femme Nikita]]'' in 1990, a movie that inspired remakes in both United States and in Hong Kong. In 1994, he also made ''[[L\u00e9on: The Professional|L\u00e9on]]'' (starring [[Jean Reno]] and a young [[Natalie Portman]]), and in 1997 ''[[The Fifth Element]]'', which became a cult favorite and launched the career of [[Milla Jovovich]].\n\n[[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] made ''[[Delicatessen (1991 film)|Delicatessen]]'' and ''[[The City of Lost Children]]'' (''La Cit\u00e9 des enfants perdus''), both of which featured a distinctly fantastical style.\n\nIn 1992, [[Claude Sautet]] co-wrote (with Jacques Fieschi) and directed ''[[Un Coeur en Hiver]]'', considered by many to be a masterpiece. [[Mathieu Kassovitz]]'s 1995 film ''Hate'' (''[[La Haine]]'') received critical praise and made [[Vincent Cassel]] a star, and in 1997, [[Juliette Binoche]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role in ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]''.\n\nThe success of [[Michel Ocelot]]'s ''[[Kirikou and the Sorceress]]'' in 1998 rejuvenated the production of original feature-length animated films by such filmmakers as [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Laguionie]] and [[Sylvain Chomet]].\n\n==== 2000s ====\n[[File:Texas Instruments, DLP Cinema Prototype System, Mark V, Paris, 2000 - Philippe Binant Archives.jpg|thumb|First [[digital cinema]] projection in Paris with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]] (2000).]]\nIn 2000, Philippe Binant realized the first [[digital cinema]] projection in [[Europe]], with the DLP CINEMA technology developed by [[Texas Instruments]], in Paris.<ref name=\"auto\"/><ref name=\"auto1\"/><ref name=\"google.com\"/>\n\nIn 2001, after a brief stint in Hollywood, [[Jean-Pierre Jeunet]] returned to France with ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (''Le Fabuleux Destin d'Am\u00e9lie Poulain'') starring [[Audrey Tautou]]. It became the highest-grossing French-language film ever released in the United States. The following year, ''[[Brotherhood of the Wolf]]'' became the second-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States since 1980 and went on to gross more than $70 million worldwide.\n\nIn 2008, [[Marion Cotillard]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] and the [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role]] for her portrayal of legendary French singer [[\u00c9dith Piaf]] in ''[[La Vie en Rose (film)|La Vie en Rose]]'', the first French-language performance to be so honored. The film won two Oscars and four [[BAFTA]]s and became the third-highest-grossing French-language film in the United States since 1980. Cotillard was the first female and second person to win both an Academy Award and [[C\u00e9sar Award]] for the same performance.\n\nAt the 2008 [[Cannes Film Festival]], ''[[Entre les murs]]'' (''The Class'') won the [[Palme d'Or]], the 6th French victory at the festival. The 2000s also saw an increase in the number of individual competitive awards won by French artists at the Cannes Festival, for [[Best Director Award (Cannes Film Festival)|direction]] ([[Tony Gatlif]], ''[[Exils]]'', 2004), [[Best Screenplay Award (Cannes Film Festival)|screenplay]] ([[Agn\u00e8s Jaoui]] and [[Jean-Pierre Bacri]], ''[[Look at Me (film)|Look at Me]]'', 2004), [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|female acting]] ([[Isabelle Huppert]], ''[[The Piano Teacher (film)|The Piano Teacher]]'', 2001; [[Charlotte Gainsbourg]], ''[[Antichrist (film)|Antichrist]]'', 2009) and male acting ([[Jamel Debbouze]], [[Samy Naceri]], [[Roschdy Zem]], [[Sami Bouajila]] and [[Bernard Blancan]], ''[[Days of Glory (2006 film)|Days of Glory]]'', 2006).\n\nThe 2008 rural comedy ''[[Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis]]'' drew an audience of more than 20 million, the first French film to do so. Its $193 million gross in France puts it just behind ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' as the most successful film of all time in French theaters.\n\nIn the 2000s, several French directors made international productions, often in the action genre. These include [[G\u00e9rard Pir\u00e8s]] (''[[Steal (film)|Riders]]'', 2002), [[Pitof]] (''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'', 2004), [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Richet]] (''[[Assault on Precinct 13 (2005 film)|Assault on Precinct 13]]'', 2005), [[Florent Emilio Siri]] (''[[Hostage (2005 film)|Hostage]]'', 2005), [[Christophe Gans]] (''[[Silent Hill (film)|Silent Hill]]'', 2006), [[Mathieu Kassovitz]] (''[[Babylon A.D.]]'', 2008), [[Louis Leterrier]] (''[[The Transporter]]'', 2002; ''[[Transporter 2]]'', 2005; [[Olivier Megaton]] directed ''[[Transporter 3]]'', 2008), [[Alexandre Aja]] (''[[Mirrors (film)|Mirrors]]'', 2008), and [[Pierre Morel]] (''[[Taken (film)|Taken]]'', 2009).\n\nSurveying the entire range of French filmmaking today, Tim Palmer calls contemporary cinema in France a kind of eco-system, in which commercial cinema co-exists with artistic radicalism, first-time directors (who make up about 40% of all France's directors each year) mingle with veterans, and there even occasionally emerges a fascinating pop-art hybridity, in which the features of intellectual and mass cinemas are interrelated (as in filmmakers like Valeria Bruni-Tedeschi, Olivier Assayas, Ma\u00efwenn, Sophie Filli\u00e8res, Serge Bozon, and others).<ref>Palmer, Tim (2011).

The [[Canal+]] TV channel has a broadcast license requiring it to support the production of movies. Some taxes are levied on movies and TV channels for use as subsidies for movie production. Some tax breaks are given for investment in movie productions, as is common elsewhere [[Movie production incentives in the United States|including in the United States]]. The sale of DVDs is prohibited for four months after the showing in theaters, so as to ensure some revenue for movie theaters.

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Courtney Whitmore|of the same name]] created by Johns and Lee Moder. The series follows Courtney Whitmore, portrayed by [[Brec Bassinger]], who discovers the cosmic staff and becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes who become the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nDC Universe ordered the series in July 2018. Bassinger was cast in September 2018, with additional castings for her family members, the Justice Society of America, and the [[Injustice Society]] through February 2019. Filming for the series began by March 2019 in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] in Georgia.\n\n''Stargirl'' is set to premiere on May 18, 2020. The series will also air the following day on [[The CW]], as well as be available on The CW's digital platforms. Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were featured in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", establishing ''Stargirl'' as existing on [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse post-Crisis)|a parallel Earth to the Arrowverse series]].\n\n==Premise==\nHigh school sophomore [[Courtney Whitmore]] discovers a powerful cosmic staff, and after learning that her step-father [[Pat Dugan]] used to be a hero sidekick, becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Brec Bassinger]] as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]]:<br />A high school sophomore who discovers a powerful cosmic staff and becomes the hero Stargirl.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> She is the leader of the new [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Bassinger did not look at the previous portrayals of the character by [[Britt Irvin]] on ''[[Smallville]]'' or [[Sarah Grey]] on ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' because they were depicted as \"older, more mature version[s]\" of Stargirl. Bassinger added the series followed the comic ''[[Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.]]'' more \"in that she's young, high school, naive, which I wanted to bring that into this version of Stargirl.\"<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Anjelika Washington as [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid-Nite]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"Washington\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Yvette Monreal]] as [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez / Wildcat]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Christopher James Baker as [[Brainwave (comics)|Henry King / Brainwave]]: A member of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Joy Osmanski]] as [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Paula Brooks / Tigress]]: A member of the Injustice Society who hunts the world's most dangerous humans.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" />\n* [[Neil Hopkins]] as [[Sportsmaster|Lawrence \"Crusher\" Crock / Sportsmaster]]: A member of the Injustice Society who feels all of his targets are part of a game to win.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" />\n* [[Nelson Lee]] as [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dr. Ito / Dragon King]]: A member of the Injustice Society and a controversial scientist who hides his face and experiments on himself and his patients.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as [[Pat Dugan|Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.]]:<br />Courtney's stepfather, the former sidekick to Starman (when he was known as Stripesy), and a mechanic who pilots a 15-foot robot of his own creation.<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> He is a member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Cameron Gellman as [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler / Hourman]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"Gellman\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Barbara Whitmore: Courtney's mother and wife of Pat Dugan striving to balance her work and home life.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n* [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Icicle (comics)|Jordan Mahkent / Icicle]]: A member of the Injustice Society.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Hunter Sansone<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n* Trae Romano as Mike Dugan: Pat Dugan's son and Courtney's stepbrother.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Joel McHale]] as [[Sylvester Pemberton|Sylvester Pemberton / Starman]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America who used an anti-gravity cosmic staff that Courtney finds.<ref name=\"McHale\" />\n* [[Lou Ferrigno, Jr.]] as [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Rex Tyler / Hourman]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is \"a master chemist and adrenaline junkie\" with the ability to acquire super-strength for one hour a day.<ref name=\"Ferrigno\" />\n* Brian Stapf as [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant / Wildcat]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is a former heavyweight boxer.<ref name=\"Stapf\" />\n* [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Charles McNider|Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is a detective and a brilliant and forward-thinking medical pioneer.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\n===Guest===\n* Jake Austin Walker<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" />\n* Meg DeLacy as Cindy Burman: The daughter of Dragon King and the most popular student at Blue Valley High who is determined to follow in her father's footsteps.<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" />\n* Hina Khan as a principal<ref name=\"Khan\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#12223A |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = Pilot\n| RTitle          = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BuuwJytAyi9/|title=IT.

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Sarah Schechter]]. Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\". For the first season, star [[Brec Bassinger]] felt the original [[Charles McNider|Doctor Mid-Nite, Charles McNider]] would have \"a significant role to play\", while Johns added the season would establish the [[Seven Soldiers of Victory]] and the first superhero team before the JSA and explore the history of the Cosmic Staff.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n\n===Casting===\nIn September 2018, it was announced that [[Brec Bassinger]] had been cast as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]].<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> Johns called the casting of Stargirl a difficult process, auditioning hundreds of actress for the role.

It is based on the [[DC Comics]] [[superhero]] [[Courtney Whitmore|of the same name]] created by Johns and Lee Moder. The series follows Courtney Whitmore, portrayed by [[Brec Bassinger]], who discovers the cosmic staff and becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes who become the [[Justice Society of America]].\n\nDC Universe ordered the series in July 2018. Bassinger was cast in September 2018, with additional castings for her family members, the Justice Society of America, and the [[Injustice Society]] through February 2019. Filming for the series began by March 2019 in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]] in Georgia.\n\n''Stargirl'' is set to premiere on May 18, 2020. The series will also air the following day on [[The CW]], as well as be available on The CW's digital platforms. Ahead of the series premiere, characters from the series were featured in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\", establishing ''Stargirl'' as existing on [[Earth-2 (Arrowverse post-Crisis)|a parallel Earth to the Arrowverse series]].\n\n==Premise==\nHigh school sophomore [[Courtney Whitmore]] discovers a powerful cosmic staff, and after learning that her step-father [[Pat Dugan]] used to be a hero sidekick, becomes the inspiration for a new generation of superheroes.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" />\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Main===\n* [[Brec Bassinger]] as [[Courtney Whitmore|Courtney Whitmore / Stargirl]]:<br />A high school sophomore who discovers a powerful cosmic staff and becomes the hero Stargirl.<ref name=\"Bassinger\" /> She is the leader of the new [[Justice Society of America]].<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" /> Bassinger did not look at the previous portrayals of the character by [[Britt Irvin]] on ''[[Smallville]]'' or [[Sarah Grey]] on ''[[Legends of Tomorrow]]'' because they were depicted as \"older, more mature version[s]\" of Stargirl. Bassinger added the series followed the comic ''[[Stars and S.T.R.I.P.E.]]'' more \"in that she's young, high school, naive, which I wanted to bring that into this version of Stargirl.\"<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Anjelika Washington as [[Doctor Mid-Nite#Beth Chapel|Beth Chapel / Doctor Mid-Nite]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"Washington\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Yvette Monreal]] as [[Wildcat (Yolanda Montez)|Yolanda Montez / Wildcat]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Christopher James Baker as [[Brainwave (comics)|Henry King / Brainwave]]: A member of the [[Injustice Society]].<ref name=\"MonrealBaker\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Joy Osmanski]] as [[Tigress (DC Comics)|Paula Brooks / Tigress]]: A member of the Injustice Society who hunts the world's most dangerous humans.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" />\n* [[Neil Hopkins]] as [[Sportsmaster|Lawrence \"Crusher\" Crock / Sportsmaster]]: A member of the Injustice Society who feels all of his targets are part of a game to win.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" />\n* [[Nelson Lee]] as [[Dragon King (DC Comics)|Dr. Ito / Dragon King]]: A member of the Injustice Society and a controversial scientist who hides his face and experiments on himself and his patients.<ref name=\"InjusticeSociety\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Luke Wilson]] as [[Pat Dugan|Pat Dugan / S.T.R.I.P.E.]]:<br />Courtney's stepfather, the former sidekick to Starman (when he was known as Stripesy), and a mechanic who pilots a 15-foot robot of his own creation.<ref name=\"Wilson\" /> He is a member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Cameron Gellman as [[Hourman (Rick Tyler)|Rick Tyler / Hourman]]: A member of the new Justice Society of America.<ref name=\"Gellman\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* [[Amy Smart]] as Barbara Whitmore: Courtney's mother and wife of Pat Dugan striving to balance her work and home life.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n* [[Neil Jackson]] as [[Icicle (comics)|Jordan Mahkent / Icicle]]: A member of the Injustice Society.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" /><ref name=\"IGNJSAReveal\" />\n* Hunter Sansone<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n* Trae Romano as Mike Dugan: Pat Dugan's son and Courtney's stepbrother.<ref name=\"Final4Starring\" />\n\n===Recurring===\n* [[Joel McHale]] as [[Sylvester Pemberton|Sylvester Pemberton / Starman]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America who used an anti-gravity cosmic staff that Courtney finds.<ref name=\"McHale\" />\n* [[Lou Ferrigno, Jr.]] as [[Hourman (Rex Tyler)|Rex Tyler / Hourman]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is \"a master chemist and adrenaline junkie\" with the ability to acquire super-strength for one hour a day.<ref name=\"Ferrigno\" />\n* Brian Stapf as [[Wildcat (Ted Grant)|Ted Grant / Wildcat]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is a former heavyweight boxer.<ref name=\"Stapf\" />\n* [[Henry Thomas]] as [[Charles McNider|Charles McNider / Doctor Mid-Nite]]: A member of the original Justice Society of America, who is a detective and a brilliant and forward-thinking medical pioneer.<ref name=\"Thomas\" />\n\n===Guest===\n* Jake Austin Walker<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" />\n* Meg DeLacy as Cindy Burman: The daughter of Dragon King and the most popular student at Blue Valley High who is determined to follow in her father's footsteps.<ref name=\"WalkerDeLacy\" />\n* Hina Khan as a principal<ref name=\"Khan\" />\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Episode table |background=#12223A |overall= |title= |director= |writer= |airdate= |prodcode= |released=y |episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| Title           = Pilot\n| RTitle          = <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.instagram.com/p/BuuwJytAyi9/|title=IT.

The pilot is set to be written by [[Geoff Johns]] who will executive produce alongside [[Greg Berlanti]] and [[Sarah Schechter]]. Production companies involved with the series are Mad Ghost Productions, Berlanti Productions, and [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The series was said to be a \"reimagining\" of [[Courtney Whitmore|Stargirl]].<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\n===Writing===\nJohns described ''Stargirl'' as having a similar tone to 1980s films such as ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' and ''[[Back to the Future]]''. The start of the series sees the deaths of the original members of the [[Justice Society of America]] (JSA). With the younger generation taking up their mantle, Johns said their \"paths aren't complete. They don't know where they're going to be or what they're going to be. And so, there's all sorts of mistakes they can make and choices they can make, and who knows what their ultimate destiny will be?... It makes for a lot of fun and a lot of unpredictability.\" The members of the [[Injustice Society]] mirrors those on the JSA team, with Johns teasing that just about everyone who has been a member of the Injustice Society in the comics would appear in the series. Speaking to classic JSA members such as [[Alan Scott]] and [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]], Johns called them the \"elderly statesmen\" and that they \"are spoken of and they exist in the JSA\" with \"their legacies... felt throughout the show\". There were also \"plans in the future for things\".

He ranks either first or second in power hitting categories for Canadian major leaguers. Stairs also holds the all-time MLB record of home runs hit as a pinch-hitter with 23. His ability to pinch hit made him a valuable asset to several teams and earned him the nickname \"Matt Stairs \u2013 Professional Hitter\".

After playing Bantam & Midget baseball, at age 16 and 17, he played for the local Marysville Royals of the [[New Brunswick Senior Baseball League]] and was voted \"Rookie of The Year\" in 1984 and the league's [[Most Valuable Player]] in 1985. He was also named [[Nova Scotia Senior Baseball League]] MVP in 1987 and '88 while playing for the Fredericton Schooners.\n\nHe attended the National Baseball Institute (NBI) in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] for one year and played for Canada at the 1987 World Amateur Championships in Italy where he was named to the \"World All-Star\" team. In 1988, he joined the Canadian Junior National team after graduating from [[Fredericton High School]]. From there he went on to play for the Canadian Olympic Team at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea.\n\n==Minor league career==\nOn January 17, 1989, Stairs was signed as an international free agent by the [[Montreal Expos]]. Stairs was then assigned to low single-A [[Jamestown Expos]] where he played second and third base. He played Double-A ball in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] for the Harrisburg Senators where he led the league in hitting and was voted the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]]'s 1991 Most Valuable Player. In 1992 and 1993, he moved up to Triple-A ([[Indianapolis Indians|Indianapolis]] and [[Ottawa Lynx|Ottawa]], respectively), with only brief appearances in the majors. Over his career, Stairs has played for six other minor league teams: The [[Indianapolis Indians]] (Triple-A) in 1992, the [[Ottawa Lynx]] (Triple-A) in 1993, the [[New Britain Red Sox]] (Double-A) in 1994, the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] (Triple-A) in 1995, the [[Edmonton Trappers]] (Triple-A) in 1996 and a few rehab games for the [[Nashville Sounds]] (Triple-A) in 2003. His totals in the minors include a .291 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] with 46 [[home run]]s and 237 [[Run batted in|RBI]].<ref>[http://minors.baseball-reference.com/players.cgi?pid=13937 Matt Stairs Statistics (Minor Leagues)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405112359/http://minors.baseball-reference.com/players.cgi?pid=13937 |date=April 5, 2008 }} ''Minors.baseball-reference.com''</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 1993, Stairs' contract was purchased by the [[Chunichi Dragons]] of the [[Nippon Professional Baseball|NPB]]. He played 60 games for the Dragons that season, hitting .250, with 6 home runs in 142 at bats.\n\n==Major league career==\n===Montreal Expos===\nStairs began his [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] career in 1992 with the Montreal Expos, with whom he played sporadically throughout the season.  On December 15, 1993, he was re-signed as a [[free agent]] by Montreal. He ended up only playing in 19 games for the Expos from 1992 to 1993. He was sold on February 18, 1994 to the [[Boston Red Sox]] and assigned to Double-A New Britain for the 1994 season.\n\n===Boston Red Sox===\nHe started the 1995 season with the Pawtucket farm club until being called up to the major leagues in June 1995. He played in 39 games for the Red Sox, hitting .261 with 1 HR and 17 RBI. At the end of the season, he accepted an offer to play with the [[Oakland Athletics]] after becoming a free agent.\n\n===Oakland Athletics===\nStairs had the best years of his career playing for the Athletics. He was called up from Triple-A [[Edmonton Trappers|Edmonton]] in 1996, after crushing [[International League]] pitching to a tune of a .344 average with 8 homeruns and 41 RBI over the first 51 games. In 1999, he finished 17th in the [[American League]] in the [[MVP]] race with a .258 batting average, 38 home runs and 102 RBI. He played mostly in right field and as a [[designated hitter]], alongside superstars [[Rickey Henderson]], [[Mark McGwire]], and [[Jose Canseco]], throughout his tenure in Oakland.\n\nIn his July 5, 1996 debut with Oakland, Stairs tied a major league record with six runs batted in during one inning. That first inning performance included a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] and a two-run single.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/06/sports/baseball-matt-stairs-and-a-s-have-a-huge-first.html  \"BASEBALL;Matt Stairs and A's Have a Huge First\"], ''The New York Times'', July 06, 1996, accessed June 17, 2013.</ref> (subsequently broken by [[Fernando Tat\u00eds]] in 1999). In 1998, he finished 17th in the [[American League]] in the [[MVP]] race with a .258 batting average, 38 home runs and 102 RBI.\n\nAfter five seasons with the Athletics, during which he hit 122 home runs and drove in 315 RBI, he was traded on November 20, 2000 to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for minor league pitcher Eric Ireland. The trade was largely seen as a cost-cutting move by the cash-strapped Athletics\u2014Stairs was set to earn $3.2 million for the 2001 season, and his production had dropped in 2000, hitting just .227 with 21 home runs and 81 RBI.\n\n===Chicago Cubs===\nHe was the [[first baseman]] for the Cubs in 2001. He had an OBP of .358 and hit 17 HRs and drove in 61 runs in 128 games. After 2001, he signed with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] as a free agent for the 2002 season.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nIn 2002, Stairs had a similar season to the previous one with the Cubs. He finished the season with 16 home runs, but still had a low batting average, hitting .244. He elected to sign with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] the following season.\n\n===Pittsburgh Pirates===\n2003 was a strong year for Stairs. He had the best batting average of his career, hitting .292 in 128 games playing as a first baseman and outfielder. He also hit 20 home runs and drove in 57 runs. Stairs' 2003 season included a 3-game series back in Canada against the Blue Jays. In the three games at [[Rogers Centre]] (then called the Skydome), Stairs had 5 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in 8 [[at-bat]]s which included 2 long home runs.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/4848/splits;_ylt=AgaBqJmUpItSxZYuDh.lm3uFCLcF?year=2003&type=Batting Matt Stairs \u2013 Toronto Blue Jays \u2013 Split Statistics \u2013 MLB \u2013 Yahoo! Sports]. Sports.yahoo.com.</ref>\n\n===Kansas City Royals===\nStairs enjoyed three solid years with the [[Kansas City Royals]] after signing with them following the '03 season. Despite being on one of the worst teams in baseball, Stairs helped some of the younger players like [[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]] and [[David DeJesus]] adjust to the majors. He hit 39 home runs in his two-and-a-half years in Kansas City. On July 31, 2006, at the trade deadline, Stairs was dealt to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for [[Joselo D\u00edaz]].\n\n===Texas Rangers===\nThe Rangers hoped that Stairs could provide some veteran leadership on their club, but he just played in 26 games before being waived by the Rangers in 2006. He was picked up off waivers by the [[Detroit Tigers]] on September 15, 2006.\n\n===Detroit Tigers===\nOn the day he was claimed, he immediately went to Detroit, arriving at [[Comerica Park]] halfway through the game and immediately taking [[Marcus Thames]]'s place in the lineup. The Tigers picked up Stairs in hopes that his experience could help them hold their division lead. The Tigers lost their division lead on the final day of the season, but still clinched the [[Wild card (sports)|Wild Card]]. Since he was acquired after August 31, the deadline for play-off eligible players, he was unable to play for the Tigers during the playoffs. The Tigers went on to win the AL Pennant and lost in the [[World Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. He did not re-sign with the Tigers following the season.\n\n===Toronto Blue Jays===\nOn December 7, 2006, Stairs and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] agreed to a one-year minor-league contract with an invitation to [[spring training]]. He made the team and saw significant playing time as the fourth outfielder, replacing [[Lyle Overbay]] at first base during Overbay's time on the [[Disabled list|DL]]. The 2007 season rejuvenated Stairs' career, due to increased playing time following injuries to [[Reed Johnson]] and Overbay. Unexpectedly playing every day, he performed well above expectations, providing consistency at the plate and a valuable veteran presence in the Toronto dugout; team manager [[John Gibbons]] publicly stated, \"I don't know where we'd be without him.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/228878 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | title=Stairs has another big day | first=Mark | last=Zwolinski | date=June 24, 2007 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> As of September 4, Stairs had the highest [[slugging average]] on the Jays at .606 and the highest batting average at .312.\n\nOn August 8, 2007, Stairs became the first Toronto Blue Jays player to hit five consecutive [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] in five at-bats, and the first Major Leaguer to double in five straight at-bats in fourteen years since [[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]] accomplished the feat in 1993.<ref>[http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20070808&content_id=2138199&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tor The Official Site of The Toronto Blue Jays: News: Toronto Blue Jays News].

With performance bonuses, Stairs could make as much as $3.50 million based on plate appearances.\n\nThough his age and increasingly poor speed earned him a reputation as a defensive liability in the outfield, he still possessed a strong throwing arm, and was considered a perfectly capable fielder at first. In 2008, Stairs initially platooned in left field with [[Shannon Stewart (baseball)|Shannon Stewart]]; however, upon the club's release of [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], Stairs became the everyday DH for the ball club. Stairs was [[designated for assignment]] on August 28, 2008.\n\n===Philadelphia Phillies===\nOn August 30, 2008, Stairs was traded to the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] for [[Fabio Castro]].<ref>[http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/news/press_releases/press_release.jsp?ymd=20080830&content_id=3390552&vkey=pr_phi&fext=.jsp&c_id=phi Phillies acquire Stairs].

In the 2009 season, he once again made it to the World Series.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://philadelphia.phillies.mlb.com/media/video.jsp?content_id=3618349 |title=Video of Matt Stairs' Home Run in Dodger Stadium in 2008 NLCS }}</ref>\n\nHe won the first [[World Series ring]] of his 16-year career on October 29, 2008, when the Phillies won the [[2008 World Series|series]] against the Rays, 4 games to 1. On April 12, 2009, Stairs' game-winning home run against the [[Colorado Rockies]] was the last home run called by legendary broadcaster [[Harry Kalas]], who died unexpectedly less than 24 hours later.\n\nStairs faced Broxton again in the ninth inning of Game Four of the 2009 NLCS rematch between the Phillies and Dodgers at Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia. Broxton pitched around Stairs, walking him on four pitches.

After playing Bantam & Midget baseball, at age 16 and 17, he played for the local Marysville Royals of the [[New Brunswick Senior Baseball League]] and was voted \"Rookie of The Year\" in 1984 and the league's [[Most Valuable Player]] in 1985. He was also named [[Nova Scotia Senior Baseball League]] MVP in 1987 and '88 while playing for the Fredericton Schooners.\n\nHe attended the National Baseball Institute (NBI) in [[Vancouver, British Columbia]] for one year and played for Canada at the 1987 World Amateur Championships in Italy where he was named to the \"World All-Star\" team. In 1988, he joined the Canadian Junior National team after graduating from [[Fredericton High School]]. From there he went on to play for the Canadian Olympic Team at the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]], South Korea.\n\n==Minor league career==\nOn January 17, 1989, Stairs was signed as an international free agent by the [[Montreal Expos]]. Stairs was then assigned to low single-A [[Jamestown Expos]] where he played second and third base. He played Double-A ball in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]] for the Harrisburg Senators where he led the league in hitting and was voted the [[Eastern League (U.S. baseball)|Eastern League]]'s 1991 Most Valuable Player. In 1992 and 1993, he moved up to Triple-A ([[Indianapolis Indians|Indianapolis]] and [[Ottawa Lynx|Ottawa]], respectively), with only brief appearances in the majors. Over his career, Stairs has played for six other minor league teams: The [[Indianapolis Indians]] (Triple-A) in 1992, the [[Ottawa Lynx]] (Triple-A) in 1993, the [[New Britain Red Sox]] (Double-A) in 1994, the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] (Triple-A) in 1995, the [[Edmonton Trappers]] (Triple-A) in 1996 and a few rehab games for the [[Nashville Sounds]] (Triple-A) in 2003. His totals in the minors include a .291 [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]] with 46 [[home run]]s and 237 [[Run batted in|RBI]].<ref>[http://minors.baseball-reference.com/players.cgi?pid=13937 Matt Stairs Statistics (Minor Leagues)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080405112359/http://minors.baseball-reference.com/players.cgi?pid=13937 |date=April 5, 2008 }} ''Minors.baseball-reference.com''</ref>\n\nOn June 8, 1993, Stairs' contract was purchased by the [[Chunichi Dragons]] of the [[Nippon Professional Baseball|NPB]]. He played 60 games for the Dragons that season, hitting .250, with 6 home runs in 142 at bats.\n\n==Major league career==\n===Montreal Expos===\nStairs began his [[Major League Baseball|Major League]] career in 1992 with the Montreal Expos, with whom he played sporadically throughout the season.  On December 15, 1993, he was re-signed as a [[free agent]] by Montreal. He ended up only playing in 19 games for the Expos from 1992 to 1993. He was sold on February 18, 1994 to the [[Boston Red Sox]] and assigned to Double-A New Britain for the 1994 season.\n\n===Boston Red Sox===\nHe started the 1995 season with the Pawtucket farm club until being called up to the major leagues in June 1995. He played in 39 games for the Red Sox, hitting .261 with 1 HR and 17 RBI. At the end of the season, he accepted an offer to play with the [[Oakland Athletics]] after becoming a free agent.\n\n===Oakland Athletics===\nStairs had the best years of his career playing for the Athletics. He was called up from Triple-A [[Edmonton Trappers|Edmonton]] in 1996, after crushing [[International League]] pitching to a tune of a .344 average with 8 homeruns and 41 RBI over the first 51 games. In 1999, he finished 17th in the [[American League]] in the [[MVP]] race with a .258 batting average, 38 home runs and 102 RBI. He played mostly in right field and as a [[designated hitter]], alongside superstars [[Rickey Henderson]], [[Mark McGwire]], and [[Jose Canseco]], throughout his tenure in Oakland.\n\nIn his July 5, 1996 debut with Oakland, Stairs tied a major league record with six runs batted in during one inning. That first inning performance included a [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] and a two-run single.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/06/sports/baseball-matt-stairs-and-a-s-have-a-huge-first.html  \"BASEBALL;Matt Stairs and A's Have a Huge First\"], ''The New York Times'', July 06, 1996, accessed June 17, 2013.</ref> (subsequently broken by [[Fernando Tat\u00eds]] in 1999). In 1998, he finished 17th in the [[American League]] in the [[MVP]] race with a .258 batting average, 38 home runs and 102 RBI.\n\nAfter five seasons with the Athletics, during which he hit 122 home runs and drove in 315 RBI, he was traded on November 20, 2000 to the [[Chicago Cubs]] for minor league pitcher Eric Ireland. The trade was largely seen as a cost-cutting move by the cash-strapped Athletics\u2014Stairs was set to earn $3.2 million for the 2001 season, and his production had dropped in 2000, hitting just .227 with 21 home runs and 81 RBI.\n\n===Chicago Cubs===\nHe was the [[first baseman]] for the Cubs in 2001. He had an OBP of .358 and hit 17 HRs and drove in 61 runs in 128 games. After 2001, he signed with the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] as a free agent for the 2002 season.\n\n===Milwaukee Brewers===\nIn 2002, Stairs had a similar season to the previous one with the Cubs. He finished the season with 16 home runs, but still had a low batting average, hitting .244. He elected to sign with the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] the following season.\n\n===Pittsburgh Pirates===\n2003 was a strong year for Stairs. He had the best batting average of his career, hitting .292 in 128 games playing as a first baseman and outfielder. He also hit 20 home runs and drove in 57 runs. Stairs' 2003 season included a 3-game series back in Canada against the Blue Jays. In the three games at [[Rogers Centre]] (then called the Skydome), Stairs had 5 [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] in 8 [[at-bat]]s which included 2 long home runs.<ref>[https://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/4848/splits;_ylt=AgaBqJmUpItSxZYuDh.lm3uFCLcF?year=2003&type=Batting Matt Stairs \u2013 Toronto Blue Jays \u2013 Split Statistics \u2013 MLB \u2013 Yahoo! Sports]. Sports.yahoo.com.</ref>\n\n===Kansas City Royals===\nStairs enjoyed three solid years with the [[Kansas City Royals]] after signing with them following the '03 season. Despite being on one of the worst teams in baseball, Stairs helped some of the younger players like [[John Buck (baseball)|John Buck]] and [[David DeJesus]] adjust to the majors. He hit 39 home runs in his two-and-a-half years in Kansas City. On July 31, 2006, at the trade deadline, Stairs was dealt to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for [[Joselo D\u00edaz]].\n\n===Texas Rangers===\nThe Rangers hoped that Stairs could provide some veteran leadership on their club, but he just played in 26 games before being waived by the Rangers in 2006. He was picked up off waivers by the [[Detroit Tigers]] on September 15, 2006.\n\n===Detroit Tigers===\nOn the day he was claimed, he immediately went to Detroit, arriving at [[Comerica Park]] halfway through the game and immediately taking [[Marcus Thames]]'s place in the lineup. The Tigers picked up Stairs in hopes that his experience could help them hold their division lead. The Tigers lost their division lead on the final day of the season, but still clinched the [[Wild card (sports)|Wild Card]]. Since he was acquired after August 31, the deadline for play-off eligible players, he was unable to play for the Tigers during the playoffs. The Tigers went on to win the AL Pennant and lost in the [[World Series]] to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]]. He did not re-sign with the Tigers following the season.\n\n===Toronto Blue Jays===\nOn December 7, 2006, Stairs and the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] agreed to a one-year minor-league contract with an invitation to [[spring training]]. He made the team and saw significant playing time as the fourth outfielder, replacing [[Lyle Overbay]] at first base during Overbay's time on the [[Disabled list|DL]]. The 2007 season rejuvenated Stairs' career, due to increased playing time following injuries to [[Reed Johnson]] and Overbay. Unexpectedly playing every day, he performed well above expectations, providing consistency at the plate and a valuable veteran presence in the Toronto dugout; team manager [[John Gibbons]] publicly stated, \"I don't know where we'd be without him.\"<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.thestar.com/Sports/article/228878 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | title=Stairs has another big day | first=Mark | last=Zwolinski | date=June 24, 2007 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref> As of September 4, Stairs had the highest [[slugging average]] on the Jays at .606 and the highest batting average at .312.\n\nOn August 8, 2007, Stairs became the first Toronto Blue Jays player to hit five consecutive [[Double (baseball)|doubles]] in five at-bats, and the first Major Leaguer to double in five straight at-bats in fourteen years since [[Charles Johnson (catcher)|Charles Johnson]] accomplished the feat in 1993.<ref>[http://toronto.bluejays.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20070808&content_id=2138199&vkey=recap&fext=.jsp&c_id=tor The Official Site of The Toronto Blue Jays: News: Toronto Blue Jays News].

With performance bonuses, Stairs could make as much as $3.50 million based on plate appearances.\n\nThough his age and increasingly poor speed earned him a reputation as a defensive liability in the outfield, he still possessed a strong throwing arm, and was considered a perfectly capable fielder at first. In 2008, Stairs initially platooned in left field with [[Shannon Stewart (baseball)|Shannon Stewart]]; however, upon the club's release of [[Frank Thomas (designated hitter)|Frank Thomas]], Stairs became the everyday DH for the ball club.

In junior high school, Rosenquist won a short-term scholarship to study at the [[Minneapolis College of Art and Design|Minneapolis School of Art]] and subsequently studied painting at the [[University of Minnesota]] from 1952 to 1954.

He started by painting [[Phillips 66]] signs, going to gas stations from North Dakota to Wisconsin. After leaving school, Rosenquist took a series of odd jobs and then turned to sign painting.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> From 1957 to 1960, Rosenquist earned his living as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] painter.

So were Warhol's photo silk-screening and Lichtenstein's lining of panels from comic strips.

With ''President Elect'', Rosenquist seeks to make a statement on the new role that advertising and mass media had during the Kennedy's campaign. \"I was very interested at that time in people who advertised themselves,\" said Rosenquist. \"Why did they put up an advertisement of themselves? So that was his face. And his promise was half a Chevrolet and a piece of stale cake.\" In the painting, Rosenquist contrasts the portrait of Kennedy with the cake and the Chevrolet to show how each element is marketed to American consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n''F-111'': In 1965, James Rosenquist completed ''F-111'', one of the largest and most ambitious works in his collection.<ref>(n.d.).

His parents were amateur pilots of [[Swedes|Swedish]] descent who moved from town to town to look for work, finally settling in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. His mother, who was also a painter, encouraged her son to have an artistic interest. In junior high school, Rosenquist won a short-term scholarship to study at the [[Minneapolis College of Art and Design|Minneapolis School of Art]] and subsequently studied painting at the [[University of Minnesota]] from 1952 to 1954.  In 1955, at the age of 21, he moved to [[New York, New York|New York City]] on scholarship to study at the [[Art Students League of New York|Art Students League]], studying under painters such as [[Edwin Dickinson]] and [[George Grosz]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25939/in-the-studio-james-rosenquist/|title=In the Studio: James Rosenquist|last=Kastner|first=Jeffrey|date=November 22, 2007|publisher=artinfo.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524084109/http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/25939/in-the-studio-james-rosenquist/|archivedate=May 24, 2008|url-status=dead|accessdate=April 21, 2008}}</ref> Talking about his experience at the Art Students League, Rosenquist said \"I studied only with the abstract artists.

He started by painting [[Phillips 66]] signs, going to gas stations from North Dakota to Wisconsin. After leaving school, Rosenquist took a series of odd jobs and then turned to sign painting.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> From 1957 to 1960, Rosenquist earned his living as a [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] painter. Rosenquist applied sign-painting techniques to the large-scale paintings he began creating in 1960. Like other pop artists, Rosenquist adapted the visual language of advertising and [[popular culture|pop culture]] to the context of fine art.<ref>{{cite web|title= James Rosenquist, The Bird of Paradise Approaches the Hot Water Planet, 1988, Oil on canvas, 105 x 85 inches|website= www.acquavellagalleries.com |publisher=Acquavella Galleries|url=  https://www.acquavellagalleries.com/artists/james-rosenquist}}</ref>\n\"I painted billboards above every candy store in Brooklyn. \"I got so I could paint a [[Schenley Industries|Schenley]] whiskey bottle in my sleep\", he wrote in his 2009 autobiography, ''Painting Below Zero: Notes on a Life in Art''.<ref name=\"theguardian\"/> ''Time'' magazine stated that \"his powerful graphic style and painted montages helped define the 1960s Pop Art movement.\"<ref>\"Milestones James Rosenquist,\" ''Time,'' April 17, 2017, p.&nbsp;15</ref>\n\nIn 2003, art critic [[Peter Schjeldahl]] asked of Rosenquist's application of [[sign painting]] techniques to fine art thus: \"[W]as importing the method into art a bit of a cheap trick? So were Warhol's photo silk-screening and Lichtenstein's lining of panels from comic strips. The goal in all cases was to fuse painting aesthetics with the semiotics of media-drenched contemporary reality. The naked efficiency of anti-personal artmaking defines classic Pop. It's as if someone were inviting you to inspect the fist with which he simultaneously punches you.\"<ref name=\"nytimes\" />\n\nRosenquist had his first two solo exhibitions at the [[Green Gallery]] in 1962 and 1963.<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> He exhibited his painting ''F-111'', a room-scale painting, at the [[Leo Castelli Gallery]] in 1965,<ref name=\"nytimes\" /> with which he achieved international acclaim.<ref name=\"The Permanent Collections of the Guggenheim Museums\">{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=17bpAAAAMAAJ |title=The Permanent Collections of the Guggenheim Museums |publisher=Museo Guggenheim Bilbao |year=2007 |page=162}}</ref>\n\nBut Rosenquist said the following about his involvement in the Pop Art movement: \"They [art critics] called me a Pop artist because I used recognizable imagery. The critics like to group people together. I didn't meet [[Andy Warhol]] until 1964. I did not really know Andy or [[Roy Lichtenstein]] that well.

Rosenquist uses icons in pop culture to examine fame and the relationship between advertising and the consumer, exploring the kind of fame and iconography that comes with American politics. With ''President Elect'', Rosenquist seeks to make a statement on the new role that advertising and mass media had during the Kennedy's campaign. \"I was very interested at that time in people who advertised themselves,\" said Rosenquist. \"Why did they put up an advertisement of themselves? So that was his face. And his promise was half a Chevrolet and a piece of stale cake.\" In the painting, Rosenquist contrasts the portrait of Kennedy with the cake and the Chevrolet to show how each element is marketed to American consumers.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n''F-111'': In 1965, James Rosenquist completed ''F-111'', one of the largest and most ambitious works in his collection.<ref>(n.d.).

Rosenquist juxtaposes the imagery from the ads against the plane as a way to imply graphic scenes from the war, with broken light bulbs near the cockpit mirroring bombs dropping from the plane, and the hood of the hairdryer echoing the look of a missile.

{"title_page": "National Statuary Hall Collection", "text_new": "{{short description|Collection of statues in the US Capitol of notable individuals from each state}}\n{{about|the collection of statues|the room where the majority, but not all, are located|National Statuary Hall}}\n{{See also|List of sculptures in the National Statuary Hall Collection}}\n[[Image:National Statuary Hall Collection.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Part of the National Statuary Hall Collection.]]\n[[File:Car of history.jpg|thumb|right|300px|200px|Presiding over the Hall, Carlo Franzoni's 1819 sculptural [[chariot clock]], the ''Car of History'' depicts [[Clio]], the Greek [[Muses|muse]] of history.]]\nThe '''National Statuary Hall Collection''' in the [[United States Capitol]] is composed of statues donated by individual states to honor persons notable in their history. Limited to two statues per state, the collection was originally set up in the old Hall of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which was then renamed [[National Statuary Hall]]. The expanding collection has since been spread throughout the Capitol and its Visitor's Center.\n\nWith the addition of New Mexico's second statue in 2005, the collection is now complete with 100 statues contributed by 50 states, plus one from the [[District of Columbia]], plus one for all the states ([[Rosa Parks]]). Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, and Ohio have each replaced one of their first two statues after Congress authorized replacements in 2000.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a National Statuary Hall originated in the middle of the nineteenth century, before the completion of the present House wing in 1857. At that time, the House of Representatives moved into its new larger chamber and the old vacant chamber became a thoroughfare between the Rotunda and the House wing. Suggestions for the use of the chamber were made as early as 1853 by [[Gouverneur Kemble]], a former member of the House, who pressed for its use as a gallery of historical paintings. The space between the columns seemed too limited for this purpose, but it was well suited for the display of busts and statuary.\n\n[[Image:PopeUnveiling1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sculptor [[Cliff Fragua]], right, poses at the unveiling and dedication of the ''[[Po'pay (Fragua)|Po'pay]]'' statue in September 2005. The statue is the 100th in the collection.]]\nOn April 19, 1864, Representative [[Justin S. Morrill]] asked: \"To what end more useful or grand, and at the same time simple and inexpensive, can we devote it [the Chamber] than to ordain that it shall be set apart for the reception of such statuary as each State shall elect to be deserving of in this lasting commemoration?\" His proposal to create a National Statuary Hall became law on July 2, 1864:\n\n{{quote|[...] the President is hereby authorized to invite each and all the States to provide and furnish statues, in [[Marble sculpture|marble]] or [[bronze sculpture|bronze]], not exceeding two in number for each State, of deceased persons who have been citizens thereof, and illustrious for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services such as each State may deem to be worthy of this national commemoration; and when so furnished the same shall be placed in the Old Hall of the House of Representatives, in the Capitol of the United States, which is set apart, or so much thereof as may be necessary, as a national statuary hall for the purpose herein indicated.}}\n\nOriginally, all state statues were placed in National Statuary Hall. However, the aesthetic appearance of the Hall began to suffer from overcrowding until, in 1933, the situation became unbearable. At that time the Hall held 65 statues, which stood, in some cases, three deep. More important, the structure of the chamber would not support the weight of any more statues. Therefore, in 1933 Congress passed a resolution that:\n\n{{quote|the [[Architect of the Capitol]], upon the approval of the Joint Committee on the Library, with the advice of the Commission of Fine Arts, is hereby authorized and directed to relocate within the Capitol any of the statues already received and placed in Statuary Hall, and to provide for the reception and location of the statues received hereafter from the States.}}\n\nUnder authority of this resolution it was decided that only one statue from each state should be placed in Statuary Hall. The others would be given prominent locations in designated areas and corridors of the Capitol. A second rearrangement of the statues was made in 1976 by authorization of the Joint Committee on the Library. To improve the crowded appearance of the collection, thirty-eight statues were rearranged in Statuary Hall according to height and material. Statues representing ten of the thirteen original colonies were moved to the Central Hall of the East Front Extension on the first floor of the Capitol. The remainder of the statues were distributed throughout the Capitol, mainly in the Hall of Columns and the connecting corridors of the House and Senate wings. Legislation was introduced in 2005 that would authorize the collection to include one statue from each U.S. Territory; it did not pass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr4070|title=To permit each of the territories of the United States to provide and furnish a statue honoring a citizen of the territory to be placed in Statuary Hall in the same manner as statues honoring citizens of the States are placed in Statuary Hall. (2005 \u2013 H.R. 4070)|website=GovTrack.us|language=en|access-date=2019-04-20}}</ref>\n\nEach statue is the gift of a state, not of an individual or group of citizens. Proceedings for the donation of a statue usually begin in the state legislature with the enactment of a resolution that names the citizen to be commemorated and cites his or her qualifications, specifies a committee or commission to represent the state in selecting the sculptor, and provides for a method of obtaining the necessary funds to carry the resolution into effect. In recent years, the statues have been unveiled during ceremonies in the Rotunda and displayed there for up to six months. They are then moved to a permanent location approved by the Joint Committee on the Library. An act of Congress ({{usc|2|2132}}), enacted in 2000, permits states to provide replacements and repossess the earlier one.\n\nA [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-4145 special act] of Congress, {{USPL|109|116}}, signed on December 1, 2005, directed the Joint Committee on the Library to obtain a [[Rosa Parks (National Statuary Hall)|statue]] of [[Rosa Parks]] and to place the statue in the United States Capitol in National Statuary Hall in a suitable permanent location. On February 27, 2013, Parks became the first African-American woman to have her likeness in the Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/rosa-parks-full-bodied-statue-african-american-depicted/story?id=18608892|title=Rosa Parks: First Statue of African-American Female to Grace Capitol|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref> Though located in Statuary Hall, Parks' statue is ''not'' part of the Collection; neither Alabama (her birth state) nor Michigan (where she lived most of her later years) commissioned it, and both states are represented in the Collection by other statues.\n\nIn 2002, Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] introduced a bill in Congress to allow the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] to place two statues in the collection, in parity with the 50 states. While the bill was not enacted, the district commissioned two statues, one of abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]], the other of D.C. master planner [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre L'Enfant]], and housed them in [[One Judiciary Square]] in hopes of eventually placing them in the Capitol. A 2010 version of the bill to accept D.C.'s statues stalled after House Republicans began adding amendments weakening D.C.'s gun laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2014/06/19/first-statue-representing-dc-unveiled-us-capitol|title=First Statue Representing D.C.

Limited to two statues per state, the collection was originally set up in the old Hall of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], which was then renamed [[National Statuary Hall]]. The expanding collection has since been spread throughout the Capitol and its Visitor's Center.\n\nWith the addition of New Mexico's second statue in 2005, the collection is now complete with 100 statues contributed by 50 states, plus one from the [[District of Columbia]], plus one for all the states ([[Rosa Parks]]). Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, and Ohio have each replaced one of their first two statues after Congress authorized replacements in 2000.\n\n==History==\nThe concept of a National Statuary Hall originated in the middle of the nineteenth century, before the completion of the present House wing in 1857. At that time, the House of Representatives moved into its new larger chamber and the old vacant chamber became a thoroughfare between the Rotunda and the House wing. Suggestions for the use of the chamber were made as early as 1853 by [[Gouverneur Kemble]], a former member of the House, who pressed for its use as a gallery of historical paintings. The space between the columns seemed too limited for this purpose, but it was well suited for the display of busts and statuary.\n\n[[Image:PopeUnveiling1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Sculptor [[Cliff Fragua]], right, poses at the unveiling and dedication of the ''[[Po'pay (Fragua)|Po'pay]]'' statue in September 2005. The statue is the 100th in the collection.]]\nOn April 19, 1864, Representative [[Justin S. Morrill]] asked: \"To what end more useful or grand, and at the same time simple and inexpensive, can we devote it [the Chamber] than to ordain that it shall be set apart for the reception of such statuary as each State shall elect to be deserving of in this lasting commemoration?\" His proposal to create a National Statuary Hall became law on July 2, 1864:\n\n{{quote|[...] the President is hereby authorized to invite each and all the States to provide and furnish statues, in [[Marble sculpture|marble]] or [[bronze sculpture|bronze]], not exceeding two in number for each State, of deceased persons who have been citizens thereof, and illustrious for their historic renown or for distinguished civic or military services such as each State may deem to be worthy of this national commemoration; and when so furnished the same shall be placed in the Old Hall of the House of Representatives, in the Capitol of the United States, which is set apart, or so much thereof as may be necessary, as a national statuary hall for the purpose herein indicated.}}\n\nOriginally, all state statues were placed in National Statuary Hall. However, the aesthetic appearance of the Hall began to suffer from overcrowding until, in 1933, the situation became unbearable. At that time the Hall held 65 statues, which stood, in some cases, three deep. More important, the structure of the chamber would not support the weight of any more statues. Therefore, in 1933 Congress passed a resolution that:\n\n{{quote|the [[Architect of the Capitol]], upon the approval of the Joint Committee on the Library, with the advice of the Commission of Fine Arts, is hereby authorized and directed to relocate within the Capitol any of the statues already received and placed in Statuary Hall, and to provide for the reception and location of the statues received hereafter from the States.}}\n\nUnder authority of this resolution it was decided that only one statue from each state should be placed in Statuary Hall. The others would be given prominent locations in designated areas and corridors of the Capitol. A second rearrangement of the statues was made in 1976 by authorization of the Joint Committee on the Library. To improve the crowded appearance of the collection, thirty-eight statues were rearranged in Statuary Hall according to height and material. Statues representing ten of the thirteen original colonies were moved to the Central Hall of the East Front Extension on the first floor of the Capitol. The remainder of the statues were distributed throughout the Capitol, mainly in the Hall of Columns and the connecting corridors of the House and Senate wings. Legislation was introduced in 2005 that would authorize the collection to include one statue from each U.S. Territory; it did not pass.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/109/hr4070|title=To permit each of the territories of the United States to provide and furnish a statue honoring a citizen of the territory to be placed in Statuary Hall in the same manner as statues honoring citizens of the States are placed in Statuary Hall. (2005 - H.R. 4070)|website=GovTrack.us|language=en|access-date=2019-04-20}}</ref>\n\nEach statue is the gift of a state, not of an individual or group of citizens. Proceedings for the donation of a statue usually begin in the state legislature with the enactment of a resolution that names the citizen to be commemorated and cites his or her qualifications, specifies a committee or commission to represent the state in selecting the sculptor, and provides for a method of obtaining the necessary funds to carry the resolution into effect. In recent years, the statues have been unveiled during ceremonies in the Rotunda and displayed there for up to six months. They are then moved to a permanent location approved by the Joint Committee on the Library. An act of Congress ({{usc|2|2132}}), enacted in 2000, permits states to provide replacements and repossess the earlier one.\n\nA [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-4145 special act] of Congress, {{USPL|109|116}}, signed on December 1, 2005, directed the Joint Committee on the Library to obtain a [[Rosa Parks (National Statuary Hall)|statue]] of [[Rosa Parks]] and to place the statue in the United States Capitol in National Statuary Hall in a suitable permanent location. On February 27, 2013, Parks became the first African-American woman to have her likeness in the Hall.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/rosa-parks-full-bodied-statue-african-american-depicted/story?id=18608892|title=Rosa Parks: First Statue of African-American Female to Grace Capitol|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=27 February 2013}}</ref> Though located in Statuary Hall, Parks' statue is ''not'' part of the Collection; neither Alabama (her birth state) nor Michigan (where she lived most of her later years) commissioned it, and both states are represented in the Collection by other statues.\n\nIn 2002, Delegate [[Eleanor Holmes Norton]] introduced a bill in Congress to allow the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] to place two statues in the collection, in parity with the 50 states. While the bill was not enacted, the district commissioned two statues, one of abolitionist [[Frederick Douglass]], the other of D.C. master planner [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant|Pierre L'Enfant]], and housed them in [[One Judiciary Square]] in hopes of eventually placing them in the Capitol. A 2010 version of the bill to accept D.C.'s statues stalled after House Republicans began adding amendments weakening D.C.'s gun laws.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blogs.weta.org/boundarystones/2014/06/19/first-statue-representing-dc-unveiled-us-capitol|title=First Statue Representing D.C.
