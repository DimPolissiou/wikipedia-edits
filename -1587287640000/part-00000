The character has appeared in both live action and animated television series and films, as well as in video games in her alter-egos as both [[Batgirl]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]].\n\n==Film==\n===Live-action===\nIn 1997, [[Alicia Silverstone]] portrayed '''Barbara Wilson'''/Batgirl in the film [[Batman & Robin (film)|''Batman & Robin'']].  Unlike the comics, this version of Barbara is not the Commissioner Gordon's daughter but Alfred Pennyworth's niece. This change was probably made because Gordon and Batman are not as close in the movies as they are in the comics. Her Batgirl costume in the film is completely different than the one from the comics as it lacks gold accents and had a Robin-style domino mask. Like Batman and Robin, she also had a silvery Arctic version of her costume with a cowl (similar to the one in the comics), in which she briefly wears. In 2008, Hannah Gunn briefly portrayed Barbara Gordon in [[The Dark Knight (film)|''The Dark Knight'']].\n\nIn March 2017, it was announced that [[Joss Whedon]] was in talks to write, direct and produce a Batgirl film as part of the [[DC Extended Universe]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2017/film/news/batgirl-movie-joss-whedon-warner-bros-1202018544/|title='Batgirl' Movie: Joss Whedon to Direct Standalone Film|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Dave|last=McNary|date=March 30, 2017|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> The film will feature the [[Barbara Gordon]] incarnation of the character, with [[The New 52]] comics by [[Gail Simone]] serving as \"a starting point\" for the film.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/movies/2017/03/30/joss-whedon-batgirl-movie-barbara-gordon/|title=Joss Whedon will write and direct a Batgirl movie about Barbara Gordon|last=Breznican|first=Anthony|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 30, 2017|accessdate=March 30, 2017}}</ref> In April 2017, Whedon stated that he was fascinated by a character that chooses to be a vigilante, even though she hadn't suffered any tragedies in her life like [[Batman|Bruce Wayne / Batman]], and that the damaged aspect of the character will be explored in the film.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/joss-whedon-batgirl-exploring-damage-behind-his-next-superhero-995812 | title=Joss Whedon on 'Batgirl' and Exploring the \"Damage\" Behind His Next Superhero}}</ref> In July, Geoff John's stated production on the film would begin in 2018.

Batgirl's role in the film was expanded from the source material, including depicting her decision to retire as Batgirl just before the Joker's attack after a tense case with a ruthless gang leader, as well as an encounter with Batman that ended with them having sex. There is also a post-credits scene where Barbara, some time after recovering in the hospital, now operates as Oracle. Barbara's role and portrayal in the film (which differs heavily from most other portrayals) has been heavily criticized as \"cheap, misogynistic writing\".<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://filmschoolrejects.com/killing-joke-2016-review-595f8a5b7264#.5tujuunfm | title=It's Time for the Killing Joke to die| date=2016-07-26}}</ref>\n\n====''The LEGO Batman Movie''====\n[[Rosario Dawson]] voiced Barbara Gordon in ''[[The Lego Batman Movie|The LEGO Batman Movie]]''.<ref>http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/lego-batman-rosario-dawson-plat-832508</ref> This incarnation is the new Police Commissioner of the Gotham City Police Department after her father retires.

Her Batgirl costume color was purple with gold accents and it also incorporated a long red wig to hide her real avocado-style, black hair.\n\nIn a promotional short,<ref>{{cite web | title = Television Obscurities - Batgirl and the Batman Phenomenon|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/batgirl/ | accessdate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> librarian Barbara Gordon encounters millionaire [[Bruce Wayne]] and his \"youthful ward\" [[Dick Grayson]] at the [[Gotham City]] Public Library. As Gordon and Wayne become acquainted, [[Killer Moth]] and his henchmen (in full costume) discuss a plan of attack. One henchman suggests taking Bruce Wayne hostage, but Killer Moth shows reluctance, due to Wayne's alleged friendship with [[Batman]]. Moth directs the group to kidnap Wayne's business acquaintance instead, who also happens to be a billionaire. When Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson realize the presence of their adversaries, they quickly leave the library to change into Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].\n\n[[File:Yvonne Craig Batgirl.JPG|thumb|The late [[Yvonne Craig]] as Batgirl.|alt=Yvonne Craig poses in the Batgirl costume from the television show, holding the cape open. The costume consists of a purple bodysuit, cowl, gloves, boots, a yellow cape and belt.]]\n\nMeanwhile, Gordon is locked in the library's office by Killer Moth's henchmen, however, it is revealed there is a secret chamber within the office where she changes into Batgirl. When Batman and Robin arrive to apprehend Moth and his gang, all parties are shocked at the arrival of a Batgirl. Batman, Robin, and Batgirl defeat the villains with relative ease and Batgirl vanishes without revealing her secret identity. Batgirl's costume in the episode closely resembles that later seen in the series, though the design of her mask changes. The short also featured a unique version of the Batman theme, ending with the lyric \"Batgirl!\" rather than the usual \"Batman!\" (and accompanied by an appropriately modified Batman logo).\n\nThe promotional short was able to renew the series for a third season and add Batgirl to its regular cast. Batgirl's official debut was in the episode \"[[Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin]]\".<ref>{{cite episode\n | title = Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin\n | url = http://www.tv.com/batman-1966/enter-batgirl-exit-penguin/episode/6903/summary.html\n | series = Batman\n | serieslink = Batman (TV series)\n | airdate = 1967-09-14\n | season = 3\n | number = 1}}</ref> The [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] kidnaps [[Commissioner Gordon]]'s daughter Barbara, binds her to a chair and gags her, and hides her in the next-door apartment which is being redecorated. The dynamic duo make it their mission to rescue her. The Penguin plans to marry her, thinking that becoming Commissioner Gordon's son-in-law would make him immune from arrest. He ungags her and forces her to agree to this by threatening to have Gordon killed. Pretending to be locked behind a secured door, Barbara makes her transformation into Batgirl and assists Batman and Robin in defeating the Penguin as they have been gassed and hung over a vat of acid. During the episode, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] discovers her secret identity - but he vows never to reveal it. He claims she left a few minutes ago when the fight has finished, by which time Barbara has changed back.\n\nDuring the third season, Batgirl aided Batman and Robin in solving several mysteries and even saved them from near death by herself on several occasions. Unfortunately, Batgirl's addition to the cast was not enough to save the series from cancellation. Although the promotional short has been mistakenly thought of as a pilot for Batgirl's own spin-off, it is highly unlikely ABC would have agreed to give her own series since Batman had been in danger of cancellation since the end of its first season. According to the book ''DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes'', Batgirl's addition to the cast \"was a sign of desperation. Ratings were down and there was hope that a new character might give the show a shot in the arm.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Daniels |first= Les |authorlink= Les Daniels |title= DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes |year= 1995 |publisher= Bulfinch |page = 141 |isbn= 0-8212-2076-4}}</ref>\n\nYvonne Craig once again appeared as Batgirl in a 1972 television commercial supporting [[feminism|women's rights]] (specifically, equal pay).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/batman-the-unusual-story-of-yvonne-craigs-final-appearance-as-batgirl/ |title=Batman: The Unusual Story of Yvonne Craig's Final Appearance as Batgirl |publisher=Tvseriesfinale.com |date=2008-12-19 |accessdate=2010-09-13| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100911200917/http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/batman-the-unusual-story-of-yvonne-craigs-final-appearance-as-batgirl/| archivedate= 11 September 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>\n\nThe 2003 made-for-TV film ''[[Return to the Batcave: The Misadventures of Adam and Burt]]'' included scenes recreating the filming of the 1960s TV series.

Years ago, when Batman defended the streets of Gotham City, he fathered a daughter to [[Catwoman]] which he never knew about. After the birth of her daughter Helena, Selena Kyle gave up her life as Catwoman and raised her child as a single mother. Bruce Wayne, apparently oblivious to the fact that he has a child, continues to fight crime in Gotham as Batman. Alfred tells that he \"had trained many prot\u00e9g\u00e9s over the years and one of them was Barbara Gordon, who called herself Batgirl.\" As Batman and Batgirl continued to fight the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] for control of the city, the battle came to an end with Joker's loss. However, the Joker swore revenge not on Batman himself, but on those he loved. While a hit-man was sent to murder Catwoman, the Joker, in a scene adapted directly from ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'', guns down Barbara at her apartment. With Gordon paralyzed and Kyle dead, Batman abandons Gotham, never to be seen again.\n\nSeven years later, in the present day, Barbara Gordon has now become \"Oracle\" and has adopted and trained Helena Kyle; the vigilante known as [[Huntress (comics)|The Huntress]]. They soon adopt Dinah Redmond and the three vow to protect the city of New Gotham. During the series, Oracle is briefly reunited with [[Black Canary]], described as her original partner in Birds of Prey (and the mother of Dinah Redmond), and in one episode dons the Batgirl costume once more in order to face off with [[Lady Shiva]] (while using an electronic device that allows her to temporarily walk again). In the final episode, she is able to improve her spine replacement device enough to engage in combat for several minutes though she collapses at the end of the battle. The series would last a total of thirteen episodes, leaving the mystery of Batman's whereabouts unresolved. However, a phone conversation with Alfred in [[Wayne Manor]] implies that the Dark Knight has monitored Birds of Prey activities in the city and knows of his daughter's existence.\n\n[[Laeta Kalogridis]] planned several series highlights for the second season, including [[Dick Grayson]]'s reintroduction (prompting a Barbara/Helena argument), as well as [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Koriand'r]] possibly appearing. Ollie Queen/[[Green Arrow]] would have joined Dinah, and thus the series would have progressed with a [[Cassandra Cain]] episode as well.\n\nDina Meyer additionally reprises her role as Barbara Gordon in a vocal capacity in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover event \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/12/10/crisis-on-infinite-earths-spoilers-cameos-birds-of-prey-part-3/ |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Birds of Prey TV Show's Role Revealed|work=comicbook.com|first=Jenna|last=Anderson|date=December 10, 2019|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Arrow''====\nBarbara Gordon's Oracle persona was briefly mentioned in the [[Arrow (TV series)|''Arrow'']] episode \"A.W.O.L,\" where Oliver mentions that the reason he didn't choose Oracle as [[Felicity Smoak]]'s codename is because it was taken, referencing Barbara Gordon and even possibly [[Batman]]'s existence in the Arrowverse, but still they didn't appear in that series.\n\n====''Titans''====\nBarbara Gordon was mentioned in the [[Titans (2018 TV series)|''Titans'']] episode \u201cDick Grayson\u201d, where Jason Todd lists her as one of the many people who has stated that Bruce Wayne was never the same after Grayson stopped being his partner. She is later mentioned by Dawn Granger when she lists those who were once close to Bruce, stating that she is missing after her father's death at the hands of the Joker. These references suggest that Gordon is or has been Batgirl within this universe as she knew of Grayson's close relationship with Bruce as Batman and Robin and has a close connection to both.\n\nExecutive producers Greg Walker and Akiva Goldsman have both stated that despite being part of the original planned cast for the series before it was created for the DC Universe streaming service, they are currently unable to use Gordon's character on the show, but remain eager to include her if ever possible. Due to this, many iconic scenarios related to Gordon have been used within the series without her character being involved; Grayson's complicated on/off romantic history with Granger, created specifically for the show, is reminiscent of his and Gordon's, suggesting that Granger's character to an extent is filling the role that the writers planned for Gordon. Todd being paralysed from the waist down by a super villain and placed into a wheelchair also reflects Gordon's own disability within the comic books and mirrors how she too was shot within The Killing Joke storyline. Likewise, her father being abused and photographed by the Joker is something that happened to her within the former storyline, too.\n\nIt was announced that Barbara will appear in season 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discussingfilm.net/2020/01/13/barbara-gordon-oracle-set-to-join-titans-season-3-exclusive/|title=Barbara Gordon/Oracle Set To Join 'Titans' Season 3 (EXCLUSIVE)|publisher=Discussing Film|date=January 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====''Gotham''====\nBarbara Gordon, renamed '''Barbara Lee Gordon''', appears in the [[Gotham (season 5)|fifth and final season]] of ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', portrayed by Jet\u00e9 Laurence.<ref name=\"The Beginning...\">{{Cite web |url=http://thefutoncritic.com/listings/20190403fox07/ |title=(GTH-510) \"The Beginning...\" |website=The Futon Critic |access-date=April 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\n====''The Adventures of Batman''====\n{{Main| The Adventures of Batman}}\nThe Barbara Gordon version of Batgirl made her first [[animation|animated]] appearance in the 1968 series ''The Adventures of Batman''. Jane Webb provided her voice. Her Batgirl costume is now a gray bodysuit (similar to Batman's) along with gold colored gloves, boots, bat-symbol and utility belt while her blue cape and cowl from the comics is retained. Also, the colors of the costume from the show are later adopted in the Bronze Age comics from the 1970s through the early 1980s. Barbara Gordon, this time working in the District Attorney's office instead of being a librarian, made several appearances in both her civilian persona and as her alter ego in the 1977 Saturday morning animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''. [[Adam West]] and [[Burt Ward]] reprised their roles to provide the voices for Batman and Robin, but Jane Webb was replaced by [[Melendy Britt]] for the voice of Batgirl.\n\n====''Super Friends''====\n{{Main|Super Friends}}\nAlthough not appearing in the television show, Batgirl does appear in some of the merchandise produced for the show using her design from ''The Adventures of Batman'' and the Bronze Age comics.\n\n====DC Animated Universe====\nBarbara Gordon has appeared in [[Bruce Timm]]'s [[DC animated universe]], with Batgirl voiced by [[Melissa Gilbert]] in ''Batman: The Animated Series'',<ref>\n{{cite episode\n | title = Shadow of the Bat\n | url = http://www.tv.com/batman-the-animated-series/shadow-of-the-bat-part-1-of-2/episode/72331/summary.html\n | series = Batman: The Animated Series\n | serieslink = Batman: The Animated Series\n | airdate = 1993-09-13\n | season = 2\n | number = 1}}</ref> by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] in the animated movie ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', by [[Tara Strong]] for ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' and ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', and by [[Stockard Channing]] during the first two seasons of ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' and by [[Angie Harmon]] during the last season of ''Batman Beyond'' and ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''.\n\n=====''Batman: The Animated Series''=====\n{{Main|Batman: The Animated Series}}\n[[File:Batgirl (Bruce Timm's art).jpg|thumb|Barbara Gordon as Batgirl in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.|alt= Typical depiction of Batgirl from ''Batman: The Animated Series'': grey body-suit; blue scalloped gloves, cowl, and cape; yellow belt and bat-emblem.]]\n\nIn ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', Barbara Gordon is introduced in the two-part episode \"Heart of Steel\",<ref>{{cite episode\n | title = Heart of Steel\n | url =http://www.tv.com/batman-the-animated-series/heart-of-steel-part-1-of-2/episode/69011/summary.html\n | series = Batman: The Animated Series\n | season = 1\n | number = 39}}</ref> where she assists [[Batman]] in saving her father [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] from the evil [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] supercomputer [[HARDAC]] (although [[Fox Kids]]' original broadcast order has her first appearance in the episode \"I Am the Night\"). She makes her first appearance as Batgirl in the two-part episode \"Shadow of the Bat\" in which Commissioner Gordon is framed for corruption. Barbara asks Batman to appear at a public rally to support Gordon but the Dark Knight declines, citing more important things to do in investigating who framed Gordon. Barbara then decides to impersonate Batman at the rally, intending only to be seen in the shadows. But when there is a drive-by shooting, she leaps into action to assist. Robin appears as well and attempts to grab her, accidentally ripping the back of her mask which causes her hair to spill out. When media articles the next day ask the question \"Who is Batgirl?\", Barbara decides she can accomplish her goal with greater ease as Batgirl than as a civilian and redesigns her costume as a more contrast from Batman's. Her Batgirl costume is exactly the same from ''The Adventures of Batman'' and from the Bronze Age comics, but with blue gloves and boots instead of yellow ones to reflect Batman's costume while retaining the same gold bat-symbol and utility belt from the comics. She discovers that Gill Mason of the GCPD (under [[Two-Face]]'s orders) is behind the frame-up and goes to rescue her father, only to complicate the rescue already underway by Batman and Robin. In the end, Batgirl is the one who captures Mason. Although Batman had been critical of her at first, the Dark Knight changes this thinking after witnessing her capabilities. Barbara's final appearance is in the episode \"Batgirl Returns\" in which she is seen having a flirting relationship with her classmate [[Dick Grayson]] at Gotham State University. In the movie ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', Barbara Gordon appears a central character and her age is revealed to be 20. She is first seen wearing her Batgirl costume while fighting a thug. She is then kidnapped by an associate of [[Mr. Freeze]] because she is an exact match for a transplant needed to save [[Nora Fries]]. The bulk of the film showcases Barbara using her skills to evade Mr. Freeze while trying to escape her captor's hideout. Despite being against Mr. Freeze, Barbara admits that she feels sorry for Nora and is willing to do the transfusion but only in a hospital. Eventually, Batman and Robin locate her, and the three of them manage to destroy Mr. Freeze's hideout and escape. It's also shown in this film that Barbara is in a relationship with Dick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_and_mr_freeze_subzero/ |title=Review for Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>\n\n=====''The New Batman Adventures''=====\n{{Main|The New Batman Adventures}}\n[[File:Batgirl tnba.jpg|thumb|112px|Barbara Gordon as Batgirl in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.|alt=Batgirl as depicted in ''The New Batman Adventures'': Black bodysuit and cowl; yellow bat emblem, belt, scalloped gloves, boots, and cape lining; blue cape; and red hair.]]\n\nDuring ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Barbara Gordon appears as Batgirl as a recurring character.<ref>{{cite episode\n | title = Holiday Knights\n | url = http://www.tv.com//holiday-knights/episode/115343/summary.html\n | series = The New Batman Adventures\n | serieslink = The New Batman Adventures\n | airdate = 1997-09-13\n | season = 1\n | number = 1}}</ref> Batgirl is eventually allowed into the [[Batcave]] and becomes a main character and is [[Batman]]'s main partner.

The episode \"Over the Edge\" also implies this as Nightwing \"can't believe it ended like this for us or Barbara\". The episode \"Girls' Night Out\" establishes Batgirl and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] (Kara Kent) as close friends. Along with all other characters in the series, Barbara's civilian and superhero identity were redesigned. Her Batgirl costume was changed to a black body suit with yellow gloves, boots, bat-symbol and utility belt to match her original comic book design seen in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359. In the movie ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'', Barbara Gordon appears briefly when she calls Bruce Wayne to find out who [[Batwoman]] is. She expresses jealousy and Bruce dodges the issue by faking cellular phone problems. This is Barbara's only scene in the film and hints a crush on Bruce which she expresses with hinting that she misses Bruce.\n\n=====''Batman Beyond''=====\n[[File:Barbara Gordan from Batman Beyond.gif|thumb|110px|right|Barbara Gordon as she appears in ''Batman Beyond''.]]\n\nBarbara Gordon appears in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. No longer the dashing beautiful vigilante she was in her youth, this version is a grim, bitter old woman that is the Police Commissioner. Her history is also a little revised: she and Bruce Wayne developed a romantic relationship at one point, after Dick Grayson had left, stating that \"on the streets it was like ballet\" but that \"eventually it gets old\" and she left, later thinking \"[she doesn't] hate [Bruce]. [She hates] what [Bruce's] become. Such a great man - so alone.\". Despite that she and Bruce are no longer together, she does care and wishes for Bruce to be happy. She resents Wayne dragging [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] as a new Batman as she believes Bruce did with all of his previous partners. Unlike her father, she states that vigilante justice \"went out with the tommy gun\" and insists Terry to give up being Batman. But she develops respect for the new Batman, assisting her in defending her husband Gotham [[District Attorney]] Sam Young from assassin Curar\u00e9. While she never officially endorses or helps him (as she never uses a [[Bat-Signal]]), she no longer threatens to turn him in and continually looks the other way, acknowledging his assistance in some cases even if she never asks for it. On one occasion, she was prepared to arrest Terry when she apparently witnessed the second Batman murder the criminal bomber Mad Stan despite the fact that Terry's arrest would compromise her and Bruce's secret. However, Bruce and Terry succeeded in revealing that Spellbinder had simply created an illusion of Mad Stan's death; she subsequently awarded Terry with a civic service award as an apology. The precise future of her and Dick's relationship remains unknown but Barbara tells Terry to \"try looking up for Nightwing sometime\" about how Bruce treated partners. In the movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', Barbara Gordon appears as a supporting character. When the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] returns from the dead, Terry McGinnis goes to her when Bruce Wayne refuses to talk about how this cannot be the Clown Price of Crime. When Bruce is recovering from the Joker's toxin, she reluctantly tells Terry the details: the Joker kidnapped, tortured and brainwashed Tim Drake into a miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime. During the chaos, Batgirl faced off against [[Harley Quinn]] and watched as Harley fell to an apparent death. Tim killed the Joker who was buried under [[Arkham Asylum]] and covered up the events with her father's aid a year before Tim's recovery from his trauma and Bruce forbade Tim from being Robin again as Tim soon left after this. Barbara also temporarily takes Bruce's place in advising Terry while tracking a couple of suspects as possible candidates for the Joker's true identity. At the conclusion of the film, she and Bruce visit Tim recovering in the hospital after the Joker's final defeat by Terry with Bruce reconciling his relationship with Tim.\n\n=====''Gotham Girls''=====\nBarbara Gordon is also a featured character in the [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animated web series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' (2002). A joint production of [[Warner Bros.]] and Noodle Soup Productions, the series stars Batgirl protecting Gotham City from the criminal activities of [[Catwoman]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and Harley Quinn. Although not restricted to the animated continuity, the main characters were adapted from ''The New Batman Adventures''.\n\n=====''Justice League''=====\nThe character also made several brief [[cameo appearance]]s in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series. While the Bat Embargo forbade the use of her character for the majority of the time, she appears in the episode \"The Savage Time\" [Pt. I] in the alternate timeline where she can be seen kissing Dick Grayson (as confirmed by the show's producers) and mentioned briefly in the episode \"Comfort and Joy\".<ref>{{cite episode\n | title = Comfort and Joy\n | url =http://www.tv.com//comfort-and-joy/episode/212546/summary.html\n | series = Justice League\n | serieslink = Justice League (TV series)\n | airdate = 2003-12-13\n | season = 2\n | number = 49}}</ref> Barbara Gordon was originally planned to appear in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The episode \"Double Date\" (scripted by ''[[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]]'' author [[Gail Simone]]) would have also featured Oracle's animated debut. But due to the restrictions on Batman-related characters, she was replaced with [[Green Arrow]] and the [[Question (comics)|Question]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode43/episode43.htm |title=Gail Simone speaks on JLU \"Double Date\" |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>\n\n====''The Batman''====\n{{Main| The Batman (TV series)}}\n[[File:Batgirl The Batman.jpg|thumb|[[The Batman (TV series)|''The Batman'']] version of Barbara Gordon as [[Batgirl]] alongside Batman. Art by [[Jeff Matsuda]].|alt=Batgirl drops in front of a charging Batman. The art for the comic book uses the same style as the animation for ''The Batman''.]] Unlike previous Batman series, this version is established as Batman's first official sidekick instead of Dick Grayson which was also different from the comics.\n\nBarbara Gordon appears on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' animated series, with Batgirl voiced by Danielle Judovits,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com//batgirl-begins-1/episode/416142/summary.html |title=Batgirl Begins |publisher=Tv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> and Oracle voiced by [[Kellie Martin]]. She replaced Ellen-Yin as Batman's female ally for Season three onward. Her Batgirl costume color is purple along with a black cape, cowl, gloves and boots with dark purple highlights (which is an homage to the Batgirl costume from the 60's TV series) along with a gold bat-symbol and utility belt and has white eye lenses for the first time. She also has brown eyes instead of green.\n\nShe was first mentioned on the episode \"Night and the City\" and made her first appearance on the two-part episode \"Batgirl Begins\". This version is the teenage daughter of [[James Gordon (comics)|Gotham Police Commissioner Gordon]] and a student of Gotham High. Though an excellent gymnast, she has lost interest in gymnastics; however, her father wants her to continue in the hope she might attend an [[Olympic Games]]. Although not as interested in gymnastics, she finds police detective work fascinating - which worries her father. In addition to that, Barbara associates with her close friend Pamela Isley, a fellow student with a juvenile-detention record - something James does not like. During a battle with Temblor in the Chlorogene lab, Barbara sees [[Batman]] in action; after this, the seed to use her Batgirl persona is planted. The battle also causes Pamela to become the villainess [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] after an experimental plant mutagen fell upon her former friend. Batgirl arrives at Poison Ivy's lair to help Batman save Gordon (though she originally wanted to save her friend from getting into more trouble) only to find Batman under Poison Ivy's mind control. Batgirl is then forced to fight Batman. During the battle, she beat Batman in hand-to-hand combat by kicking the Dark Knight into a pond which freed Batman of Poison Ivy's control. After she defeated Poison Ivy and saved her father, Batman decides not to tell Gordon that his daughter is Batgirl. That first adventure, Batgirl says is 'only the beginning'. During her initial introduction, she demands to be called \u201c'''[[Batwoman]]'''\u201d until Commissioner Gordon calls her by the Batgirl name.\n\nShe aids the Dark Knight with numerous cases, proving herself as a trusted ally. Batman himself, despite never asking to have a partner, becomes fond of working with her - though would not admit it. At one point, in the episode \"A Dark Knight to Remember\", she has figured out that Batman is secretly Bruce Wayne as the billionaire is physically fit and can afford to purchase equipment that Batman would require. But Wayne suffered partial amnesia during that time which made Bruce lose the memory as the Dark Knight Detective which threw Barbara off. After she and Batman saved Gotham from [[Maxie Zeus]]'s siege in the episode \"Thunder\", the Dark Knight gave her some spare gadgets and accepted her as a partner as she was in the loop, marking the only time Batgirl is Batman's first sidekick instead of Robin, which was different from the comics due to having Robin's character in [[Teen Titans (TV series)|another DC animated television series]].\n\nBatman finally let Barbara in on his own secret in the episode \"Team Penguin\" after getting [[Dick Grayson]] as a second partner. Deciding they needed teamwork training and to learn to trust one another more, the trio shares their secret identities (but Batgirl is reluctant to give up hers so Batman does it for her) and begins training. She and Robin develop a sibling-like relationship throughout the show, and gets annoyed when Robin refers to her as \"Babs\". In the two-part episode \"The Joining\", she participated in the battle to save Earth with Robin from the alien technological entity known as The Joining.\n\nThe episode \"Artifacts\" features her adult incarnation using a wheelchair (under unknown circumstances) using her Oracle identity. Oracle manages the cyber realms and has a joking yet more adult-like relationship to Nightwing. The distant future shows Batgirl, Batman and Robin are now legends similar to Robin Hood and the Merry Men and she's also known in these stories as Batwoman.\n\nIn the episode \"Joker Express\", Batgirl was under the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s control and Batman and Robin have perforce to fight her. While Robin was almost killed, Batman fought Batgirl briefly. The Dark Knight defeated her by making Barbara inhale an [[Incapacitating agent|incapacitating gas]] which eventually restores her to normal after her body and mind begin to relax.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} In the episode \"Attack of the Terrible Trio\", it is revealed that Barbara has graduated from Gotham High School at an early age and enrolled in Gotham University.\n\nIn the two-part [[Lost Heroes (episode)|series finale]], Barbara and Robin once again join the battle against The Joining with the [[Justice League]] after they lost their powers.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} After The Joining is once again defeated, she and Robin discuss the idea of forming their [[Teen Titans|own junior Justice League]].\n\n====''Batman: The Brave and The Bold''====\nThe Barbara Gordon incarnation of Batgirl appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Mae Whitman]]. Her Batgirl costume is exactly the same in the comics and her debut in ''Detective Comics'' #359. In the teaser of the episode \"The Last Patrol!\", she saves Batman from [[Killer Moth]] in a flashback. In a present-day scene of the teaser, she and Batman end up in one of the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s death traps. She returns in the episode \"The Criss Cross Conspiracy!\" in which she and Nightwing have to work alongside Batman (in Batwoman's body) and [[Felix Faust]] to save [[Batwoman]] (in Batman's body) at the mercy of the [[Riddler (comics)|Riddler]]. Additionally, the [[fourth wall]]-breaking series finale \"Mitefall!\" sees [[Bat-Mite]] altering reality in order to make ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' \"[[Jumping the Shark|jump the shark]]\" so that it will be cancelled and replaced with a more serious ''Batman'' series. In the end, he succeeds, and an in-universe commercial for the (fictional) replacement series reveals that the new show will focus on Batgirl instead, with Batman as a supporting character. [[Ambush Bug]] then compounds Bat-Mite's initial disappointment by pointing out that a darker, more serious series like the ''Batgirl'' show he has just instigated would not use a character as silly as Bat-Mite, leading the anti-hero to disappear into nothingness just before the end of the episode.\n\n====''Young Justice''====\nBarbara Gordon appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Alyson Stoner]]. In the episode \"Homefront\", she is portrayed as a student at the Gotham Academy alongside Dick Grayson and [[Artemis Crock]]. She also had a cameo appearance in the episode \"Failsafe\" of standing in the crowd with [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. In ''[[Young Justice: Invasion]]'', Batgirl has joined the Team during the five-year gap. She helps [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]] (Cassie Sandsmark) rescue U.N. Secretary General Tseng from Lobo. Her Batgirl costume is a gray bodysuit with black accents to mirror that of Batman's. In the episode \"Alienated\", she had a cameo with the rest of the Bat-Family invading a Krolotean facility. Batgirl returns in the episode \"Beneath\" as part of a team sent to investigate [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]]'s activities in Bialya. In the tie-in comics, she's shown to have a romantic interest in Dick Grayson, and appears to have a \"friends with benefits\" relationship.<ref>[[Greg Weisman]] (2013). Young Justice #25.

In \"Darkness\", Barbara overhears a conversation between Katana and Gordon in how to disable the Ion Cortex's AI. She attempts to try to help out by stealing a police van and attempting to use the computers in it. Her father catches her, but eventually agrees to help her. Batman gives her the password to the Cortex (\"Oracle\") so she can hack it and take it down. The following episode, \"Reckoning\", forces her and her dad to infiltrate the lair of [[Ra's al Ghul]] to take down the Cortex, saving Gotham City in the process. After the black-out, she continues to assist Katana and Batman, taking the codename of Oracle. In \"Alone\", she joins other [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] such as [[Metamorpho]] and [[Man-Bat]] in assisting in the final battle against [[Deathstroke]].\n\n====''Teen Titans Go!''====\nBatgirl makes appearances in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' animated series, voiced by Tara Strong once again. She makes a cameo appearance at Titans East's party in the episode \"Starliar\" when seen dancing next to [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]] before Robin obnoxiously cuts in. She is later seen in the episode \"Staring at the Future\" shown to be the future wife of Nightwing and the mother of their three babies. Her design resembles her appearance from ''The New Batman Adventures'' and her debut design from ''Detective Comics'' #359.\n\n====''DC Super Hero Girls''====\nBatgirl appears in the web series ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', with Mae Whitman reprising her role from ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold''.

She never appears in person but an artist's drawing of her is seen in her bio.\n*In ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', [[Alfred Pennyworth]] serves as Batman's guide over the radio for the first part of the game, and Oracle first appears in the Museum over the radio. No reason is given as to her absence up to that point. She and Alfred talk to Batman over the radio helping stop [[Hugo Strange]], track other inmates and villains like [[Deadshot]] as well as intercepting radio broadcasts and aiding the Dark Knight in various side missions.\n*In ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', her father James Gordon is initially hostile to Batman unlike the teenage Barbara. While Barbara immediately expresses admiration, she helps Batman access the National Criminal Database in the GCPD. She eventually manages to hack into Batman's communicator and asks help in finding and disabling the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s weapon caches, working alongside the Dark Knight for the first time.\n*In ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', Oracle helps Batman track down Scarecrow at the start, but is later kidnapped by the Arkham Knight. After Batman has a flashback of Barbara's paralysis and Gordon breaks off their alliance with Batman, the Dark Knight brings out Barbara's old Batgirl suit and looks at while reminiscing her career as Batgirl. Batman then goes on a quest to find and save her but is tragically too late. The Scarecrow apparently subjects her to his newest toxin and she goes mad, committing suicide. This drives Batman to become more determined than ever to stop Scarecrow and the Arkham Knight. But she is later revealed to be still alive - her death was part of another fear-toxin-induced hallucination. After Batman rescues Barbara and brings her to the GCPD for protection, she helps the Dark Knight fight off a wave of the Scarecrow's militia's drone forces and is shown to be engaged to Tim Drake at the end of the game.

Unlike the comics, this version of Barbara is not the Commissioner Gordon's daughter but Alfred Pennyworth's niece. This change was probably made because Gordon and Batman are not as close in the movies as they are in the comics. Her Batgirl costume in the film is completely different than the one from the comics as it lacks gold accents and had a Robin-style domino mask.

Her Batgirl costume color was purple with gold accents and it also incorporated a long red wig to hide her real avocado-style, black hair.\n\nIn a promotional short,<ref>{{cite web | title = Television Obscurities - Batgirl and the Batman Phenomenon|url=http://www.tvobscurities.com/articles/batgirl/ | accessdate = 2007-09-11}}</ref> librarian Barbara Gordon encounters millionaire [[Bruce Wayne]] and his \"youthful ward\" [[Dick Grayson]] at the [[Gotham City]] Public Library. As Gordon and Wayne become acquainted, [[Killer Moth]] and his henchmen (in full costume) discuss a plan of attack. One henchman suggests taking Bruce Wayne hostage, but Killer Moth shows reluctance, due to Wayne's alleged friendship with [[Batman]]. Moth directs the group to kidnap Wayne's business acquaintance instead, who also happens to be a billionaire. When Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson realize the presence of their adversaries, they quickly leave the library to change into Batman and [[Robin (comics)|Robin]].\n\n[[File:Yvonne Craig Batgirl.JPG|thumb|The late [[Yvonne Craig]] as Batgirl.|alt=Yvonne Craig poses in the Batgirl costume from the television show, holding the cape open. The costume consists of a purple bodysuit, cowl, gloves, boots, a yellow cape and belt.]]\n\nMeanwhile, Gordon is locked in the library's office by Killer Moth's henchmen, however, it is revealed there is a secret chamber within the office where she changes into Batgirl. When Batman and Robin arrive to apprehend Moth and his gang, all parties are shocked at the arrival of a Batgirl. Batman, Robin, and Batgirl defeat the villains with relative ease and Batgirl vanishes without revealing her secret identity. Batgirl's costume in the episode closely resembles that later seen in the series, though the design of her mask changes. The short also featured a unique version of the Batman theme, ending with the lyric \"Batgirl!\" rather than the usual \"Batman!\" (and accompanied by an appropriately modified Batman logo).\n\nThe promotional short was able to renew the series for a third season and add Batgirl to its regular cast. Batgirl's official debut was in the episode \"[[Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin]]\".<ref>{{cite episode\n | title = Enter Batgirl, Exit Penguin\n | url = http://www.tv.com/batman-1966/enter-batgirl-exit-penguin/episode/6903/summary.html\n | series = Batman\n | serieslink = Batman (TV series)\n | airdate = 1967-09-14\n | season = 3\n | number = 1}}</ref> The [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]] kidnaps [[Commissioner Gordon]]'s daughter Barbara, binds her to a chair and gags her, and hides her in the next-door apartment which is being redecorated. The dynamic duo make it their mission to rescue her. The Penguin plans to marry her, thinking that becoming Commissioner Gordon's son-in-law would make him immune from arrest. He ungags her and forces her to agree to this by threatening to have Gordon killed. Pretending to be locked behind a secured door, Barbara makes her transformation into Batgirl and assists Batman and Robin in defeating the Penguin as they have been gassed and hung over a vat of acid. During the episode, [[Alfred Pennyworth]] discovers her secret identity - but he vows never to reveal it. He claims she left a few minutes ago when the fight has finished, by which time Barbara has changed back.\n\nDuring the third season, Batgirl aided Batman and Robin in solving several mysteries and even saved them from near death by herself on several occasions. Unfortunately, Batgirl's addition to the cast was not enough to save the series from cancellation. Although the promotional short has been mistakenly thought of as a pilot for Batgirl's own spin-off, it is highly unlikely ABC would have agreed to give her own series since Batman had been in danger of cancellation since the end of its first season. According to the book ''DC Comics: Sixty Years of the World's Favorite Comic Book Heroes'', Batgirl's addition to the cast \"was a sign of desperation.

Years ago, when Batman defended the streets of Gotham City, he fathered a daughter to [[Catwoman]] which he never knew about. After the birth of her daughter Helena, Selena Kyle gave up her life as Catwoman and raised her child as a single mother. Bruce Wayne, apparently oblivious to the fact that he has a child, continues to fight crime in Gotham as Batman. Alfred tells that he \"had trained many prot\u00e9g\u00e9s over the years and one of them was Barbara Gordon, who called herself Batgirl.\" As Batman and Batgirl continued to fight the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] for control of the city, the battle came to an end with Joker's loss. However, the Joker swore revenge not on Batman himself, but on those he loved. While a hit-man was sent to murder Catwoman, the Joker, in a scene adapted directly from ''[[Batman: The Killing Joke|The Killing Joke]]'', guns down Barbara at her apartment. With Gordon paralyzed and Kyle dead, Batman abandons Gotham, never to be seen again.\n\nSeven years later, in the present day, Barbara Gordon has now become \"Oracle\" and has adopted and trained Helena Kyle; the vigilante known as [[Huntress (comics)|The Huntress]]. They soon adopt Dinah Redmond and the three vow to protect the city of New Gotham. During the series, Oracle is briefly reunited with [[Black Canary]], described as her original partner in Birds of Prey (and the mother of Dinah Redmond), and in one episode dons the Batgirl costume once more in order to face off with [[Lady Shiva]] (while using an electronic device that allows her to temporarily walk again). In the final episode, she is able to improve her spine replacement device enough to engage in combat for several minutes though she collapses at the end of the battle. The series would last a total of thirteen episodes, leaving the mystery of Batman's whereabouts unresolved. However, a phone conversation with Alfred in [[Wayne Manor]] implies that the Dark Knight has monitored Birds of Prey activities in the city and knows of his daughter's existence.\n\n[[Laeta Kalogridis]] planned several series highlights for the second season, including [[Dick Grayson]]'s reintroduction (prompting a Barbara/Helena argument), as well as [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Koriand'r]] possibly appearing. Ollie Queen/[[Green Arrow]] would have joined Dinah, and thus the series would have progressed with a [[Cassandra Cain]] episode as well.\n\nDina Meyer additionally reprises her role as Barbara Gordon in a vocal capacity in the [[Arrowverse]] crossover event \"[[Crisis on Infinite Earths (Arrowverse)|Crisis on Infinite Earths]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://comicbook.com/dc/2019/12/10/crisis-on-infinite-earths-spoilers-cameos-birds-of-prey-part-3/ |title=Crisis on Infinite Earths: Birds of Prey TV Show's Role Revealed|work=comicbook.com|first=Jenna|last=Anderson|date=December 10, 2019|accessdate=December 10, 2019}}</ref>\n\n====''Arrow''====\nBarbara Gordon's Oracle persona was briefly mentioned in the [[Arrow (TV series)|''Arrow'']] episode \"A.W.O.L,\" where Oliver mentions that the reason he didn't choose Oracle as [[Felicity Smoak]]'s codename is because it was taken, referencing Barbara Gordon and even possibly [[Batman]]'s existence in the Arrowverse, but still they didn't appear in that series.\n\n====''Titans''====\nBarbara Gordon was mentioned in the [[Titans (2018 TV series)|''Titans'']] episode \u201cDick Grayson\u201d, where Jason Todd lists her as one of the many people who has stated that Bruce Wayne was never the same after Grayson stopped being his partner. She is later mentioned by Dawn Granger when she lists those who were once close to Bruce, stating that she is missing after her father's death at the hands of the Joker. These references suggest that Gordon is or has been Batgirl within this universe as she knew of Grayson's close relationship with Bruce as Batman and Robin and has a close connection to both.\n\nExecutive producers Greg Walker and Akiva Goldsman have both stated that despite being part of the original planned cast for the series before it was created for the DC Universe streaming service, they are currently unable to use Gordon's character on the show, but remain eager to include her if ever possible. Due to this, many iconic scenarios related to Gordon have been used within the series without her character being involved; Grayson's complicated on/off romantic history with Granger, created specifically for the show, is reminiscent of his and Gordon's, suggesting that Granger's character to an extent is filling the role that the writers planned for Gordon. Todd being paralysed from the waist down by a super villain and placed into a wheelchair also reflects Gordon's own disability within the comic books and mirrors how she too was shot within The Killing Joke storyline. Likewise, her father being abused and photographed by the Joker is something that happened to her within the former storyline, too.\n\nIt was announced that Barbara will appear in season 3.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discussingfilm.net/2020/01/13/barbara-gordon-oracle-set-to-join-titans-season-3-exclusive/|title=Barbara Gordon/Oracle Set To Join 'Titans' Season 3 (EXCLUSIVE)|publisher=Discussing Film|date=January 13, 2020}}</ref>\n\n====''Gotham''====\nBarbara Gordon, renamed '''Barbara Lee Gordon''', appears in the [[Gotham (season 5)|fifth and final season]] of ''[[Gotham (TV series)|Gotham]]'', portrayed by Jet\u00e9 Laurence.<ref name=\"The Beginning...\">{{Cite web |url=http://thefutoncritic.com/listings/20190403fox07/ |title=(GTH-510) \"The Beginning...\" |website=The Futon Critic |access-date=April 4, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Animation===\n====''The Adventures of Batman''====\n{{Main| The Adventures of Batman}}\nThe Barbara Gordon version of Batgirl made her first [[animation|animated]] appearance in the 1968 series ''The Adventures of Batman''. Jane Webb provided her voice. Her Batgirl costume is now a gray bodysuit (similar to Batman's) along with gold colored gloves, boots, bat-symbol and utility belt while her blue cape and cowl from the comics is retained. Also, the colors of the costume from the show are later adopted in the Bronze Age comics from the 1970s through the early 1980s. Barbara Gordon, this time working in the District Attorney's office instead of being a librarian, made several appearances in both her civilian persona and as her alter ego in the 1977 Saturday morning animated series ''[[The New Adventures of Batman]]''. [[Adam West]] and [[Burt Ward]] reprised their roles to provide the voices for Batman and Robin, but Jane Webb was replaced by [[Melendy Britt]] for the voice of Batgirl.\n\n====''Super Friends''====\n{{Main|Super Friends}}\nAlthough not appearing in the television show, Batgirl does appear in some of the merchandise produced for the show using her design from ''The Adventures of Batman'' and the Bronze Age comics.\n\n====DC Animated Universe====\nBarbara Gordon has appeared in [[Bruce Timm]]'s [[DC animated universe]], with Batgirl voiced by [[Melissa Gilbert]] in ''Batman: The Animated Series'',<ref>\n{{cite episode\n | title = Shadow of the Bat\n | url = http://www.tv.com/batman-the-animated-series/shadow-of-the-bat-part-1-of-2/episode/72331/summary.html\n | series = Batman: The Animated Series\n | serieslink = Batman: The Animated Series\n | airdate = 1993-09-13\n | season = 2\n | number = 1}}</ref> by [[Mary Kay Bergman]] in the animated movie ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', by [[Tara Strong]] for ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'' and ''[[Gotham Girls]]'', and by [[Stockard Channing]] during the first two seasons of ''[[Batman Beyond]]'' and by [[Angie Harmon]] during the last season of ''Batman Beyond'' and ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]''.\n\n=====''Batman: The Animated Series''=====\n{{Main|Batman: The Animated Series}}\n[[File:Batgirl (Bruce Timm's art).jpg|thumb|Barbara Gordon as Batgirl in ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]''.|alt= Typical depiction of Batgirl from ''Batman: The Animated Series'': grey body-suit; blue scalloped gloves, cowl, and cape; yellow belt and bat-emblem.]]\n\nIn ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'', Barbara Gordon is introduced in the two-part episode \"Heart of Steel\",<ref>{{cite episode\n | title = Heart of Steel\n | url =http://www.tv.com/batman-the-animated-series/heart-of-steel-part-1-of-2/episode/69011/summary.html\n | series = Batman: The Animated Series\n | season = 1\n | number = 39}}</ref> where she assists [[Batman]] in saving her father [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]] from the evil [[Artificial intelligence|A.I.]] supercomputer [[HARDAC]] (although [[Fox Kids]]' original broadcast order has her first appearance in the episode \"I Am the Night\"). She makes her first appearance as Batgirl in the two-part episode \"Shadow of the Bat\" in which Commissioner Gordon is framed for corruption. Barbara asks Batman to appear at a public rally to support Gordon but the Dark Knight declines, citing more important things to do in investigating who framed Gordon. Barbara then decides to impersonate Batman at the rally, intending only to be seen in the shadows. But when there is a drive-by shooting, she leaps into action to assist. Robin appears as well and attempts to grab her, accidentally ripping the back of her mask which causes her hair to spill out. When media articles the next day ask the question \"Who is Batgirl?\", Barbara decides she can accomplish her goal with greater ease as Batgirl than as a civilian and redesigns her costume as a more contrast from Batman's. Her Batgirl costume is exactly the same from ''The Adventures of Batman'' and from the Bronze Age comics, but with blue gloves and boots instead of yellow ones to reflect Batman's costume while retaining the same gold bat-symbol and utility belt from the comics. She discovers that Gill Mason of the GCPD (under [[Two-Face]]'s orders) is behind the frame-up and goes to rescue her father, only to complicate the rescue already underway by Batman and Robin. In the end, Batgirl is the one who captures Mason. Although Batman had been critical of her at first, the Dark Knight changes this thinking after witnessing her capabilities. Barbara's final appearance is in the episode \"Batgirl Returns\" in which she is seen having a flirting relationship with her classmate [[Dick Grayson]] at Gotham State University. In the movie ''[[Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero]]'', Barbara Gordon appears a central character and her age is revealed to be 20. She is first seen wearing her Batgirl costume while fighting a thug. She is then kidnapped by an associate of [[Mr. Freeze]] because she is an exact match for a transplant needed to save [[Nora Fries]]. The bulk of the film showcases Barbara using her skills to evade Mr. Freeze while trying to escape her captor's hideout. Despite being against Mr. Freeze, Barbara admits that she feels sorry for Nora and is willing to do the transfusion but only in a hospital. Eventually, Batman and Robin locate her, and the three of them manage to destroy Mr. Freeze's hideout and escape. It's also shown in this film that Barbara is in a relationship with Dick.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/batman_and_mr_freeze_subzero/ |title=Review for Batman & Mr. Freeze: SubZero |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>\n\n=====''The New Batman Adventures''=====\n{{Main|The New Batman Adventures}}\n[[File:Batgirl tnba.jpg|thumb|112px|Barbara Gordon as Batgirl in ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''.|alt=Batgirl as depicted in ''The New Batman Adventures'': Black bodysuit and cowl; yellow bat emblem, belt, scalloped gloves, boots, and cape lining; blue cape; and red hair.]]\n\nDuring ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]'', Barbara Gordon appears as Batgirl as a recurring character.<ref>{{cite episode\n | title = Holiday Knights\n | url = http://www.tv.com//holiday-knights/episode/115343/summary.html\n | series = The New Batman Adventures\n | serieslink = The New Batman Adventures\n | airdate = 1997-09-13\n | season = 1\n | number = 1}}</ref> Batgirl is eventually allowed into the [[Batcave]] and becomes a main character and is [[Batman]]'s main partner. Batgirl was made an addition to the cast with producer [[Bruce Timm]] stating, \"The consumer products division and the people at [[The WB Television Network|the WB]] wanted to make sure kids would watch the show, so they strongly suggested we include Batgirl and [[Tim Drake]] (as Robin) as a way of courting young girl audiences as well as young boys...We liked the Batgirl character and I certainly didn't mind putting her in the show.\"<ref>{{cite book |last= Nolen-Weathington |first= Eric |title= Modern Masters Volume 3: Bruce Timm |year= 2004 |publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing| isbn = 1-893905-30-6}}</ref> It is also shown in the series that her previous relationship with [[Dick Grayson]] did not last. The episode \"You Scratch My Back\" emphasized this, portraying her relationship with Nightwing as strenuous. The episode \"Over the Edge\" also implies this as Nightwing \"can't believe it ended like this for us or Barbara\". The episode \"Girls' Night Out\" establishes Batgirl and [[Supergirl (Kara Zor-El)|Supergirl]] (Kara Kent) as close friends. Along with all other characters in the series, Barbara's civilian and superhero identity were redesigned. Her Batgirl costume was changed to a black body suit with yellow gloves, boots, bat-symbol and utility belt to match her original comic book design seen in ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #359. In the movie ''[[Batman: Mystery of the Batwoman]]'', Barbara Gordon appears briefly when she calls Bruce Wayne to find out who [[Batwoman]] is. She expresses jealousy and Bruce dodges the issue by faking cellular phone problems. This is Barbara's only scene in the film and hints a crush on Bruce which she expresses with hinting that she misses Bruce.\n\n=====''Batman Beyond''=====\n[[File:Barbara Gordan from Batman Beyond.gif|thumb|110px|right|Barbara Gordon as she appears in ''Batman Beyond''.]]\n\nBarbara Gordon appears in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. No longer the dashing beautiful vigilante she was in her youth, this version is a grim, bitter old woman that is the Police Commissioner. Her history is also a little revised: she and Bruce Wayne developed a romantic relationship at one point, after Dick Grayson had left, stating that \"on the streets it was like ballet\" but that \"eventually it gets old\" and she left, later thinking \"[she doesn't] hate [Bruce]. [She hates] what [Bruce's] become. Such a great man - so alone.\". Despite that she and Bruce are no longer together, she does care and wishes for Bruce to be happy. She resents Wayne dragging [[Batman (Terry McGinnis)|Terry McGinnis]] as a new Batman as she believes Bruce did with all of his previous partners. Unlike her father, she states that vigilante justice \"went out with the tommy gun\" and insists Terry to give up being Batman. But she develops respect for the new Batman, assisting her in defending her husband Gotham [[District Attorney]] Sam Young from assassin Curar\u00e9. While she never officially endorses or helps him (as she never uses a [[Bat-Signal]]), she no longer threatens to turn him in and continually looks the other way, acknowledging his assistance in some cases even if she never asks for it. On one occasion, she was prepared to arrest Terry when she apparently witnessed the second Batman murder the criminal bomber Mad Stan despite the fact that Terry's arrest would compromise her and Bruce's secret. However, Bruce and Terry succeeded in revealing that Spellbinder had simply created an illusion of Mad Stan's death; she subsequently awarded Terry with a civic service award as an apology. The precise future of her and Dick's relationship remains unknown but Barbara tells Terry to \"try looking up for Nightwing sometime\" about how Bruce treated partners. In the movie ''[[Batman Beyond: Return of the Joker]]'', Barbara Gordon appears as a supporting character. When the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] returns from the dead, Terry McGinnis goes to her when Bruce Wayne refuses to talk about how this cannot be the Clown Price of Crime. When Bruce is recovering from the Joker's toxin, she reluctantly tells Terry the details: the Joker kidnapped, tortured and brainwashed Tim Drake into a miniature version of the Clown Prince of Crime. During the chaos, Batgirl faced off against [[Harley Quinn]] and watched as Harley fell to an apparent death. Tim killed the Joker who was buried under [[Arkham Asylum]] and covered up the events with her father's aid a year before Tim's recovery from his trauma and Bruce forbade Tim from being Robin again as Tim soon left after this. Barbara also temporarily takes Bruce's place in advising Terry while tracking a couple of suspects as possible candidates for the Joker's true identity. At the conclusion of the film, she and Bruce visit Tim recovering in the hospital after the Joker's final defeat by Terry with Bruce reconciling his relationship with Tim.\n\n=====''Gotham Girls''=====\nBarbara Gordon is also a featured character in the [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] animated web series ''[[Gotham Girls]]'' (2002). A joint production of [[Warner Bros.]] and Noodle Soup Productions, the series stars Batgirl protecting Gotham City from the criminal activities of [[Catwoman]], [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] and Harley Quinn. Although not restricted to the animated continuity, the main characters were adapted from ''The New Batman Adventures''.\n\n=====''Justice League''=====\nThe character also made several brief [[cameo appearance]]s in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' animated series. While the Bat Embargo forbade the use of her character for the majority of the time, she appears in the episode \"The Savage Time\" [Pt. I] in the alternate timeline where she can be seen kissing Dick Grayson (as confirmed by the show's producers) and mentioned briefly in the episode \"Comfort and Joy\".<ref>{{cite episode\n | title = Comfort and Joy\n | url =http://www.tv.com//comfort-and-joy/episode/212546/summary.html\n | series = Justice League\n | serieslink = Justice League (TV series)\n | airdate = 2003-12-13\n | season = 2\n | number = 49}}</ref> Barbara Gordon was originally planned to appear in ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]''. The episode \"Double Date\" (scripted by ''[[Birds of Prey (comic)|Birds of Prey]]'' author [[Gail Simone]]) would have also featured Oracle's animated debut. But due to the restrictions on Batman-related characters, she was replaced with [[Green Arrow]] and the [[Question (comics)|Question]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jl.toonzone.net/episode43/episode43.htm |title=Gail Simone speaks on JLU \"Double Date\" |publisher=Jl.toonzone.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>\n\n====''The Batman''====\n{{Main| The Batman (TV series)}}\n[[File:Batgirl The Batman.jpg|thumb|[[The Batman (TV series)|''The Batman'']] version of Barbara Gordon as [[Batgirl]] alongside Batman. Art by [[Jeff Matsuda]].|alt=Batgirl drops in front of a charging Batman. The art for the comic book uses the same style as the animation for ''The Batman''.]] Unlike previous Batman series, this version is established as Batman's first official sidekick instead of Dick Grayson which was also different from the comics.\n\nBarbara Gordon appears on ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]'' animated series, with Batgirl voiced by Danielle Judovits,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com//batgirl-begins-1/episode/416142/summary.html |title=Batgirl Begins |publisher=Tv.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref> and Oracle voiced by [[Kellie Martin]]. She replaced Ellen-Yin as Batman's female ally for Season three onward. Her Batgirl costume color is purple along with a black cape, cowl, gloves and boots with dark purple highlights (which is an homage to the Batgirl costume from the 60's TV series) along with a gold bat-symbol and utility belt and has white eye lenses for the first time. She also has brown eyes instead of green.\n\nShe was first mentioned on the episode \"Night and the City\" and made her first appearance on the two-part episode \"Batgirl Begins\". This version is the teenage daughter of [[James Gordon (comics)|Gotham Police Commissioner Gordon]] and a student of Gotham High. Though an excellent gymnast, she has lost interest in gymnastics; however, her father wants her to continue in the hope she might attend an [[Olympic Games]]. Although not as interested in gymnastics, she finds police detective work fascinating - which worries her father. In addition to that, Barbara associates with her close friend Pamela Isley, a fellow student with a juvenile-detention record - something James does not like. During a battle with Temblor in the Chlorogene lab, Barbara sees [[Batman]] in action; after this, the seed to use her Batgirl persona is planted. The battle also causes Pamela to become the villainess [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]] after an experimental plant mutagen fell upon her former friend. Batgirl arrives at Poison Ivy's lair to help Batman save Gordon (though she originally wanted to save her friend from getting into more trouble) only to find Batman under Poison Ivy's mind control. Batgirl is then forced to fight Batman. During the battle, she beat Batman in hand-to-hand combat by kicking the Dark Knight into a pond which freed Batman of Poison Ivy's control. After she defeated Poison Ivy and saved her father, Batman decides not to tell Gordon that his daughter is Batgirl. That first adventure, Batgirl says is 'only the beginning'. During her initial introduction, she demands to be called \u201c'''[[Batwoman]]'''\u201d until Commissioner Gordon calls her by the Batgirl name.\n\nShe aids the Dark Knight with numerous cases, proving herself as a trusted ally. Batman himself, despite never asking to have a partner, becomes fond of working with her - though would not admit it. At one point, in the episode \"A Dark Knight to Remember\", she has figured out that Batman is secretly Bruce Wayne as the billionaire is physically fit and can afford to purchase equipment that Batman would require. But Wayne suffered partial amnesia during that time which made Bruce lose the memory as the Dark Knight Detective which threw Barbara off. After she and Batman saved Gotham from [[Maxie Zeus]]'s siege in the episode \"Thunder\", the Dark Knight gave her some spare gadgets and accepted her as a partner as she was in the loop, marking the only time Batgirl is Batman's first sidekick instead of Robin, which was different from the comics due to having Robin's character in [[Teen Titans (TV series)|another DC animated television series]].\n\nBatman finally let Barbara in on his own secret in the episode \"Team Penguin\" after getting [[Dick Grayson]] as a second partner. Deciding they needed teamwork training and to learn to trust one another more, the trio shares their secret identities (but Batgirl is reluctant to give up hers so Batman does it for her) and begins training. She and Robin develop a sibling-like relationship throughout the show, and gets annoyed when Robin refers to her as \"Babs\". In the two-part episode \"The Joining\", she participated in the battle to save Earth with Robin from the alien technological entity known as The Joining.\n\nThe episode \"Artifacts\" features her adult incarnation using a wheelchair (under unknown circumstances) using her Oracle identity. Oracle manages the cyber realms and has a joking yet more adult-like relationship to Nightwing. The distant future shows Batgirl, Batman and Robin are now legends similar to Robin Hood and the Merry Men and she's also known in these stories as Batwoman.\n\nIn the episode \"Joker Express\", Batgirl was under the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s control and Batman and Robin have perforce to fight her. While Robin was almost killed, Batman fought Batgirl briefly. The Dark Knight defeated her by making Barbara inhale an [[Incapacitating agent|incapacitating gas]] which eventually restores her to normal after her body and mind begin to relax.{{Clarify|date=November 2009}} In the episode \"Attack of the Terrible Trio\", it is revealed that Barbara has graduated from Gotham High School at an early age and enrolled in Gotham University.\n\nIn the two-part [[Lost Heroes (episode)|series finale]], Barbara and Robin once again join the battle against The Joining with the [[Justice League]] after they lost their powers.{{Clarify|date=February 2010}} After The Joining is once again defeated, she and Robin discuss the idea of forming their [[Teen Titans|own junior Justice League]].\n\n====''Batman: The Brave and The Bold''====\nThe Barbara Gordon incarnation of Batgirl appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Mae Whitman]]. Her Batgirl costume is exactly the same in the comics and her debut in ''Detective Comics'' #359. In the teaser of the episode \"The Last Patrol!\", she saves Batman from [[Killer Moth]] in a flashback. In a present-day scene of the teaser, she and Batman end up in one of the [[Penguin (comics)|Penguin]]'s death traps. She returns in the episode \"The Criss Cross Conspiracy!\" in which she and Nightwing have to work alongside Batman (in Batwoman's body) and [[Felix Faust]] to save [[Batwoman]] (in Batman's body) at the mercy of the [[Riddler (comics)|Riddler]]. Additionally, the [[fourth wall]]-breaking series finale \"Mitefall!\" sees [[Bat-Mite]] altering reality in order to make ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' \"[[Jumping the Shark|jump the shark]]\" so that it will be cancelled and replaced with a more serious ''Batman'' series. In the end, he succeeds, and an in-universe commercial for the (fictional) replacement series reveals that the new show will focus on Batgirl instead, with Batman as a supporting character. [[Ambush Bug]] then compounds Bat-Mite's initial disappointment by pointing out that a darker, more serious series like the ''Batgirl'' show he has just instigated would not use a character as silly as Bat-Mite, leading the anti-hero to disappear into nothingness just before the end of the episode.\n\n====''Young Justice''====\nBarbara Gordon appears in the ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Alyson Stoner]]. In the episode \"Homefront\", she is portrayed as a student at the Gotham Academy alongside Dick Grayson and [[Artemis Crock]]. She also had a cameo appearance in the episode \"Failsafe\" of standing in the crowd with [[Alfred Pennyworth]]. In ''[[Young Justice: Invasion]]'', Batgirl has joined the Team during the five-year gap. She helps [[Wonder Girl (Cassie Sandsmark)|Wonder Girl]] (Cassie Sandsmark) rescue U.N. Secretary General Tseng from Lobo. Her Batgirl costume is a gray bodysuit with black accents to mirror that of Batman's. In the episode \"Alienated\", she had a cameo with the rest of the Bat-Family invading a Krolotean facility. Batgirl returns in the episode \"Beneath\" as part of a team sent to investigate [[Secret Society of Super Villains|The Light]]'s activities in Bialya. In the tie-in comics, she's shown to have a romantic interest in Dick Grayson, and appears to have a \"friends with benefits\" relationship.<ref>[[Greg Weisman]] (2013). Young Justice #25.

In \"Darkness\", Barbara overhears a conversation between Katana and Gordon in how to disable the Ion Cortex's AI. She attempts to try to help out by stealing a police van and attempting to use the computers in it. Her father catches her, but eventually agrees to help her. Batman gives her the password to the Cortex (\"Oracle\") so she can hack it and take it down. The following episode, \"Reckoning\", forces her and her dad to infiltrate the lair of [[Ra's al Ghul]] to take down the Cortex, saving Gotham City in the process. After the black-out, she continues to assist Katana and Batman, taking the codename of Oracle. In \"Alone\", she joins other [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] such as [[Metamorpho]] and [[Man-Bat]] in assisting in the final battle against [[Deathstroke]].\n\n====''Teen Titans Go!''====\nBatgirl makes appearances in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' animated series, voiced by Tara Strong once again. She makes a cameo appearance at Titans East's party in the episode \"Starliar\" when seen dancing next to [[Garth (comics)|Aqualad]] before Robin obnoxiously cuts in. She is later seen in the episode \"Staring at the Future\" shown to be the future wife of Nightwing and the mother of their three babies.

However, it was the labor leaders who were oftentimes targeted and publicly denounced as \u201cblatherskites\u201d and \u201cdemagogues\u201d who were \u201ctoo lazy to work and unwilling to allow self-respecting men to work.\u201d<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 59.</ref>\n\n===The Chartist movement===\n\nThe organizers who participated in the creation of the American Miners\u2019 Association were working men of [[Great Britain]] who fled [[England]] in 1848 after the failed [[Chartist movement]].<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 59.</ref> Between 1838 and 1848, England faced a season of [[great depression]]s and was under the stimulus of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 60.</ref> With all these events taking place, the working-class movement in England became excited to the point of rebellion and sought [[political reform]].

Fearful of a rebellion, [[Queen Victoria]] dispatched thousands of soldiers and special constables who successfully suppressed the rebellion.<ref>Andrew 1907, p.60.</ref>\n\n===British mine workers, Thomas Lloyd and Daniel Weaver===\n\nThrough the Chartist movement, British emigrants were taught the proper methods needed to obtain power through intelligent organization.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 59.</ref> Accustomed to better labor conditions in England, many Chartist and lieutenants of the well-formed ''Miners\u2019 National Association of Great Britain'' arrived in [[United States]] and began to spread the gospel of unionism and labor rights among the American miners.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 65.</ref>  Many of these labor rights that they were accustomed to included; shorter work days, increased safety, better ventilation in mines, educational advantages for union members, higher wages and protection for union workers for the future state.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 65.</ref>\n\nThe most influential members who participated in the creation of the American Miners\u2019 Association were Thomas Lloyd and Daniel Weaver. Thomas Lloyd, first president of the Association, was a [[Welshman]] and Chartist veteran who settled on the [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville Tract]]. As an energetic worker and forcible speaker, Lloyd was able to attract mass crowds and was the chief supporter of Weaver in getting the organization started.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 247.</ref> Equally influential was Daniel Weaver, an English Chartist veteran who was raised in the mines and was self-educated. He was the author of the address, which was the call for a national convention, and the constitution for the American Miners\u2019 Association.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 247</ref>\n\n==An Attempt to Organize Miners' Prior to the American Miners' Association==\n\nPrior to the organization of the American Miners\u2019 Association, there was no need for an organization at a national level. However, organization at a local level was easily accomplished for two reasons. The first being that trade was easily controlled through organization without assistance from other districts.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 243.</ref>  Secondly, each district had its own market and therefore created no competition.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 244.</ref>   Although easily accomplished, these unions only lasted a short period of time due to public scrutiny and internal difficulties.\n\nThe need for local organization was a result of several factors. First, because the only means of transportation for coal during this period was river transportation, mining was a seasonal occupation.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 242.</ref> Coal mining was generally done by experienced hands in the spring and fall, and was transported in the summer. During the winter season, however, the only work for miners was domestic coal. In order to cut wages, employers employed inexperienced and unskilled farm hands in the mines.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 243.</ref> This resulted in competition within the mining workforce because farm hands were paid less, which resulted in starvation of miners.\n\nAnother reason for the failure of local unions was due to a policy that required corporations to eliminate labor leaders from their ranks.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 243.</ref>  They did this by offering incentives to labor leaders. These included higher wages and promotions to superintendents. This method was successful in several localities and played a prominent role in the dismantling of local unions.\n\nThe final reason for the failure of local unions was still relevant during the organization of the national union. Public scrutiny made it almost impossible for miners to take a step forward in industrial advancement because they were always faced with adverse public opinion that was generated by the corporate employers that employed them.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 242.</ref> This section will be further explained in the \u201cFall of the Organization\u201d section of this wiki.\n\n==Formation of the American Miners' Association==\n\nThe formation of the American Miners\u2019 Association was largely the work of British miners who were accustomed to better work conditions and labor rights than their American counterpart. When Daniel Weaver and Thomas Lloyd, two Chartist veterans, immigrated into the United States, they quickly attempted to build a national organization in Belleville Tract, Illinois. These former Chartist's discussed the benefits that were to be derived from the organization and urged representatives of miners from Illinois and Missouri to join in the formation.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 246.</ref>  The initial success of this national union was largely due to Daniel Weaver's To the Miners of the United States, in which he laid out several arguments in favor of unionism and provided a date and location for the January 1861 Convention. It was during this convention that Daniel Weaver showcased his constitution for the union, which was adopted and printed, and maintained the rules and laws of the organization, as well as the duties of the Executive officers to protect the miners from their employers.\n\n===To the Miners of the United States===\n\nTo the Miners of the United States was a call for representatives, mainly from Illinois and Missouri, to meet at a convention in St. Louis, Missouri, on January 28, 1861, with the goal to organize a national union. Daniel Weaver made several arguments in favor for a union, but most of them had one common theme, which was that unity was essential for the attainment of rights and to improve and alleviate their current condition.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 60-63.</ref>  By using the union as a \u201cfundamental principle,\u201d the address argued that men could do more together united, than alone.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 60-64.</ref>  This was well displayed in the preface of the constitution, which will be provided in the following section. Along with labor rights and legislative protection for their safety, interest, and well being of their families, the address also provided a section that urged individuals of the important to mutually instruct and improve their own knowledge.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 60-63.</ref>  By arguing that knowledge is power, the address argued the importance for individuals to study the law of life, relations of capital to labor, politics, municipal affairs, literature, science, and other subject relating to the general warfare of their craft. This was perhaps a mechanism to alleviate the public scrutiny that labeled them as ill-mannered individuals, and as a result, achieve support from the public.\n\n===Constitution===\n\nThe preface of the constitution included a poem that demonstrated helplessness and the sentiments that ran through the mineworkers and demonstrated how a strong organization would support them.\n\n\u201cStep by step, the longest march\nCan be won, can be won; \nSingle stones will form an arch, \nOne by one, one by one, \nAndy by union, what we will\nCan be all accomplished still. \nDrops of water turn a mill--\nSingly none, singly none.\u201d<ref>Weaver 1864, p. Preface</ref>\n\nIn the preamble of the constitution, Daniel Weaver aggressively lays out the problems that miners faced on a daily basis. These included dangers from explosions and insecure roofs, firedamp's and noxious gases, poor ventilation, and other accidents that were caused by the poor management of their employers, whose only object was to increase their capital with no remorse to the loss of life, limbs, or health of their employees.<ref>Weaver 1864, p. 5.</ref>\n\t\nThe constitution also laid out the formation of the union, in which practicing miners were formed into [[Local union|Lodges]], who were formed into [[Districts]], and supervised by the [[General Board]] who also represented the association in the corporate capacity.<ref>Weaver 1864, p. 6.</ref>  \n\t\nThe General Board consisted of one [[President (corporate title)|President]], one [[Vice-President]], one [[Treasurer]], and one Delegate who were elected from each Lodge in the Association. The officers of the General Board were elected by delegates and held their positions for two years. They were required to meet once a year, unless a special meeting was called. Information from the meetings were reported and printed through the ''Weekly Miner'', a publication that was directed and edited by John Hinchcliffe, the second president of the American Miners\u2019 Association. The ''Weekly Miner'' was essential in keeping the union up to date in current events.<ref>Weaver 1864, p. 6.</ref>   \n\t\nThe constitution also provided the duties of each Executive Officer. The President was responsible for presiding over all the meetings in the Board and appointed all necessary committees. He was subjected to the approval of the delegates in session and received applications for admission of new Lodges into the association.<ref>Weaver 1864, p. 7.</ref>  The Vice-President was responsible in performing the duties of the President if absent.<ref>Weaver 1864, p. 7.</ref> The Financial Secretary was responsible for receiving the money and drafts that were paid to the General Board and record all financial affairs. He is then responsible to turn in all the money to the Treasurer at the end of each General Board meeting or before the expiration of every three months.<ref>Weaver 1864, p. 7.</ref> The Corresponding Secretary was responsible for recording everything in meetings, communicating with the press and distant members of officers in the association, and received post office orders, communications, parcels, papers or periodicals.<ref>Weaver 1864, p. 7.</ref>  Finally, the Treasurer was responsible for receiving all money and credit that belong or pertained to the General Board.<ref>Weaver 1864, p. 7.</ref>\n\nAlong with the government and powers of the General Board, the constitution also provided general laws that members were to follow. These were various and included procedures that kept the officers from corruption, membership fees and monthly dues, penalties for failure to pay, and punishment for acting uncivil, failing to make the meetings, or disobeying the General Laws or By-Laws that were provided.<ref>Weaver 1864, p. 10-12.</ref>\n\n==Growth in the Face of Public Scrutiny==\n\nThe American Miners\u2019 Association was not long confined within the [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville Tract]] and [[Missouri]]. It made rapid strides eastward to form the districts of [[Braidwood, Illinois]], and [[La Salle, Illinois]]. In March 1863, the Tuscarawas Valley in [[Ohio]] formed its own district under the name Massillon Miners\u2019 Association.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 248.</ref> Unlike the American Miners\u2019 Association, Massillon Miners\u2019 Association provided regulation of work in mines and careful government of the association in the constitution.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 248.</ref> Along with other branches that were formed during its brief existence, the districts were all members of the branch of the Belleville headquarters.\n\n===Civil War===\n\nWhen the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] was about to break out in 1861, labor workers and leaders were well aware of the advantages it might produce to spread a national union. When millions of workingmen were pulled from their occupation, either from farms, workshops, mines, and other industrial professions, labor in these fields were scarce. With the lack of labor and an unparalleled demand coal, which was in response to due to the creation of war industries that manufactured firearms, ammunition, naval vessels, armaments, etc., the need for experience workers was drastic.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 65.</ref>  Because the demand for experienced miners far exceeded the supply of coal, wages in mines rose to three or four times its former value.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 64.</ref> When word of these high wages and need for experienced miners reached the ear of British workers in England, thousands emigrated to the United States and took advantage of the situation by enjoying high wages and bargaining rights.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 66.</ref>\n\n===Public scrutiny===\n\nAlthough rapid strides in the advancement of this national union were accomplished, they were still done under a great deal of public scrutiny. As stated earlier with the fall of local organizations, coal miners in the United States were often misunderstood and unfavorably judged, more than any other class of laborers in the world.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 248.</ref>  The prejudice beliefs that were forced upon them were traced to the corporations that employed them.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 248.</ref>  And because union meetings often took place in public spaces, journalist were known to infiltrated them in order to spread rumors of barbaric and uncivilized tactics. However, it was during times of strikes that newsletters would publish unfair and unverifiable images of miners. This was a major problem because it provided no fair representation to the miners or their grievances.\n\n==Fall of the organization==\n\n===End of Civil War===\n\nWhen the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] ended, soldiers who originally left their position returned to their work and war industries that required large amount of coal were shut down.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 65</ref>  With the increase in workers and decrease in coal, competition among producers resulted in extreme measures. Contractors cut the prices of their coal in order to make contracts in an already dull market. As a result, wages for miners were drastically cut and strikes ensued.  During the first year of the Civil War, strikes were somewhat successful with the former rate of wages restored. However, as strikes slowly began to be unsuccessful, internal dissension destroyed the union from the inside.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 67.</ref>\n\n===Strikes===\n\nThe strikes that the union participated in generally dealt with wage cuts. Union representatives argued that the wage cuts were unwarranted and unjust. However, companies argued that they were allowed to cut the wages when the market was damaged. Although successful during the first year after the Civil War, unions eventually started to lose strikes. The strikes of 1867 and 1868 eventually brought the American Miners\u2019 Association down all over the country, resulting in internal dissensions among labor leaders, members, and officers.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 59.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n* [http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/pamphlets/coal/coal_10.html Coal Mines and Coal Miners: The Story of a Great Industry and the Men Who Work In It], I.W.W.

However, it was the labor leaders who were oftentimes targeted and publicly denounced as \u201cblatherskites\u201d and \u201cdemagogues\u201d who were \u201ctoo lazy to work and unwilling to allow self-respecting men to work.\u201d<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 59.</ref>\n\n===The Chartist movement===\n\nThe organizers who participated in the creation of the American Miners\u2019 Association were working men of [[Great Britain]] who fled [[England]] in 1848 after the failed [[Chartist movement]].<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 59.</ref> Between 1838 and 1848, England faced a season of [[great depression]]s and was under the stimulus of the [[French Revolution]].<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 60.</ref> With all these events taking place, the working-class movement in England became excited to the point of rebellion and sought [[political reform]]. On April 10, 1848, [[Chartists]] leaders delivered a petition to [[Parliament]] asserting the rights of ordinary people.<ref>\"British History in Depth: The Chartist Movement 1838\u20131848\".</ref> The petition contained an exaggeration of six million signatures to enact the \"Six-Point Political Principles\" of the Chartists in the National Constitution.<ref>\"British History in Depth: The Chartist Movement 1838\u20131848\".</ref><ref>Andrew 1907, p. 60.</ref>  Originally taken from the [[United States Constitution|American Constitutional System]], these points included annual parliaments, universal suffrage, vote by ballot, abolition of property qualifications for membership in the House of Commons, payment of members, and equal electoral districts. Fearful of a rebellion, [[Queen Victoria]] dispatched thousands of soldiers and special constables who successfully suppressed the rebellion.<ref>Andrew 1907, p.60.</ref>\n\n===British mine workers, Thomas Lloyd and Daniel Weaver===\n\nThrough the Chartist movement, British emigrants were taught the proper methods needed to obtain power through intelligent organization.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 59.</ref> Accustomed to better labor conditions in England, many Chartist and lieutenants of the well-formed ''Miners\u2019 National Association of Great Britain'' arrived in [[United States]] and began to spread the gospel of unionism and labor rights among the American miners.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 65.</ref>  Many of these labor rights that they were accustomed to included; shorter work days, increased safety, better ventilation in mines, educational advantages for union members, higher wages and protection for union workers for the future state.<ref>Andrew 1907, p. 65.</ref>\n\nThe most influential members who participated in the creation of the American Miners\u2019 Association were Thomas Lloyd and Daniel Weaver. Thomas Lloyd, first president of the Association, was a [[Welshman]] and Chartist veteran who settled on the [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville Tract]]. As an energetic worker and forcible speaker, Lloyd was able to attract mass crowds and was the chief supporter of Weaver in getting the organization started.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 247.</ref> Equally influential was Daniel Weaver, an English Chartist veteran who was raised in the mines and was self-educated. He was the author of the address, which was the call for a national convention, and the constitution for the American Miners\u2019 Association.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 247</ref>\n\n==An Attempt to Organize Miners' Prior to the American Miners' Association==\n\nPrior to the organization of the American Miners\u2019 Association, there was no need for an organization at a national level. However, organization at a local level was easily accomplished for two reasons. The first being that trade was easily controlled through organization without assistance from other districts.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 243.</ref>  Secondly, each district had its own market and therefor created no competition.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 244.</ref>   Although easily accomplished, these unions only lasted a short period of time due to public scrutiny and internal difficulties.\n\nThe need for local organization was a result of several factors. First, because the only means of transportation for coal during this period was river transportation, mining was a seasonal occupation.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 242.</ref> Coal mining was generally done by experienced hands in the spring and fall, and was transported in the summer. During the winter season, however, the only work for miners was domestic coal. In order to cut wages, employers employed inexperienced and unskilled farm hands in the mines.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 243.</ref> This resulted in competition within the mining workforce because farm hands were paid less, which resulted in starvation of miners.\n\nAnother reason for the failure of local unions was due to a policy that required corporations to eliminate labor leaders from their ranks.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 243.</ref>  They did this by offering incentives to labor leaders. These included higher wages and promotions to superintendents. This method was successful in several localities and played a prominent role in the dismantling of local unions.\n\nThe final reason for the failure of local unions was still relevant during the organization of the national union. Public scrutiny made it almost impossible for miners to take a step forward in industrial advancement because they were always faced with adverse public opinion that was generated by the corporate employers that employed them.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 242.</ref> This section will be further explained in the \u201cFall of the Organization\u201d section of this wiki.\n\n==Formation of the American Miners' Association==\n\nThe formation of the American Miners\u2019 Association was largely the work of British miners who were accustomed to better work conditions and labor rights than their American counterpart. When Daniel Weaver and Thomas Lloyd, two Chartist veterans, immigrated into the United States, they quickly attempted to build a national organization in Belleville Tract, Illinois. These former Chartist's discussed the benefits that were to be derived from the organization and urged representatives of miners from Illinois and Missouri to join in the formation.<ref>McNeill, Powderly, James 1887, p. 246.</ref>  The initial success of this national union was largely due to Daniel Weaver's To the Miners of the United States, in which he laid out several arguments in favor of unionism and provided a date and location for the January 1861 Convention. It was during this convention that Daniel Weaver showcased his constitution for the union, which was adopted and printed, and maintained the rules and laws of the organization, as well as the duties of the Executive officers to protect the miners from their employers.\n\n===To the Miners of the United States===\n\nTo the Miners of the United States was a call for representatives, mainly from Illinois and Missouri, to meet at a convention in St. Louis, Missouri, on January 28, 1861, with the goal to organize a national union.

{"title_page": "Amendment of the Constitution of India", "text_new": "{{Short description|Process of amending India's constitution}}{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=November 2018}}\n'''Amending the Constitution of India''' is the process of making changes to the nation's fundamental law or supreme law. The procedure of amendment in the constitution is laid down in Part XX (Article 368) of the [[Constitution of India]]. This procedure  ensures the sanctity of the Constitution of India and keeps a check on arbitrary power of the [[Parliament of India]].\n\nHowever, there is another limitation imposed on the amending power of the constitution of India, which developed during conflicts between the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] and Parliament, where Parliament wants to exercise discretionary use of power to amend the constitution while the Supreme Court wants to restrict that power.\nThis has led to the laying down of various doctrines or rules in regard to checking the validity/legality of an amendment, the most famous among them is the [[Basic structure doctrine]] as laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of [[Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala]] .\n\n==Constituent Assembly debates==\nThe framers of the Constitution were neither in favour of the traditional theory of [[federalism]], which entrusts the task of constitutional amendment to a body other than the Legislature, nor did they favour a rigid special procedure for such amendments. They also never wanted to have a British-style system where [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is supreme. The framers, instead, adopted a combination of the \"theory of fundamental law\", which underlies the written [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] with the \"theory of parliamentary sovereignty\" as existing in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Constitution of India vests constituent power upon the Parliament subject to the special procedure laid down therein.<ref name=\"Nature and Scope\">{{cite web|title=Constitution Amendment: Nature and Scope of the Amending Process|url=http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|work=Lok Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=1 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013055/http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDuring the discussion in the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] on this aspect, some members were in favour of adopting an easier mode of amending procedure for the initial five to ten years. Explaining why it was necessary to introduce an element of flexibility in the Constitution, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] observed in the Constituent Assembly on 8 November 1948, \"While we want this Constitution to be as solid and as permanent a structure as we can make it, nevertheless there is no permanence in Constitutions. There should be a certain flexibility. If you make anything rigid and permanent, you stop a nation\u2019s growth, the growth of a living, vital, organic people. Therefore, it has to be flexible ... while we, who are assembled in this House, undoubtedly represent the people of India, nevertheless I think it can be said, and truthfully, that when a new House, by whatever name it goes, is elected in terms of this Constitution, and every adult in India has the right to vote - man and woman - the House that emerges then will certainly be fully representative of every section of the Indian people. It is right that House elected so - under this Constitution of course it will have the right to do anything - should have an easy opportunity to make such changes as it wants to. But in any event, we should not make a Constitution, such as some other great countries have, which are so rigid that they do not and cannot be adapted easily to changing conditions. Today especially, when the world is in turmoil and we are passing through a very swift period of transition, what we may do today may not be wholly applicable tomorrow. Therefore, while we make a Constitution which is sound and as basic as we can, it should also be flexible ...\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly of India Debates (Proceedings) - Vol. VII|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|pages=322\u2013323|date=8 November 1948|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103153825/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|archive-date=3 November 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDr. P.S. Deshmukh believed that the amendment of the Constitution should be made easier as he felt there were contradictory provisions in some places which would be more and more apparent when the provisions were interpreted, and that the whole administration would suffer, if the amendment to the Constitution was not made easy. Brajeshwar Prasad also favoured a flexible Constitution so as to make it survive the test of time. He was of the opinion that rigidity tends to check progressive legislation or gradual innovation. On the other hand, H.V. Kamath favoured ensuring procedural safeguards to avoid the possibility of hasty amendment to the Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n{{quotation|\"It is said that the provisions contained in the Draft make amendment difficult. It is proposed that the Constitution should be amendable by a simple majority at least for some years. The argument is subtle and ingenious. It is said that this Constituent Assembly is not elected on adult suffrage while the future Parliament will be elected on adult suffrage and yet the former has been given the right to pass the Constitution by a simple majority while the latter has been denied the same right. It is paraded as one of the absurdities of the Draft Constitution. I must repudiate the charge because it is without foundation. To know how simple are the provisions of the Draft Constitution in respect of amending the Constitution one has only to study the provisions for amendment contained in the American and Australian Constitutions. Compared to them those contained in the Draft Constitution will be found to be the simplest. The Draft Constitution has eliminated the elaborate and difficult procedures such as a decision by a convention or a referendum ... It is only for amendments of specific matters\u2014and they are only few\u2014that the ratification of the State Legislatures is required. All other Articles of the Constitution are left to be amended by Parliament. The only limitation is that it shall be done by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of each House present and voting and a majority of the total membership of each House. It is difficult to conceive a simpler method of amending the Constitution.\n\nWhat is said to be the absurdity of the amending provisions is founded upon a misconception of the position of the Constituent Assembly and of the future Parliament elected under the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly in making a Constitution has no partisan motive. Beyond securing a good and workable Constitution it has no axe to grind. In considering the Articles of the Constitution it has no eye on getting through a particular measure. The future Parliament if it met as Constituent Assembly, its members will be acting as partisans seeking to carry amendments to the Constitution to facilitate the passing of party measures which they have failed to get through Parliament by reason of some Article of the Constitution which has acted as an obstacle in their way. Parliament will have an axe to grind while the Constituent Assembly has none. That is the difference between the Constituent Assembly and the future Parliament. That explains why the Constituent Assembly though elected on limited franchise can be trusted to pass the Constitution by simple majority and why the Parliament though elected on adult suffrage cannot be trusted with the same power to amend it.\"\n|[[B. R. Ambedkar]], speaking in the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1948<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n}}\n\n==Procedure==\nThe Constitution of India provides for a distinctive amendment process when compared to the Constitutions of other nations. This can be described as partly flexible and partly rigid. The Constitution provides for a variety in the amending process. This feature has been commended by Australian academic Sir [[Kenneth Wheare]] who felt that uniformity in the amending process imposed \"quite unnecessary restrictions\" upon the amendment of parts of a Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/> An amendment of the Constitution can be initiated only by the introduction of a [[Bill (law)|Bill]] in either [[Parliament of India|House of Parliament]]. The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting.<ref>http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108220111/http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm |date=8 November 2012 }} {{PD-notice}}</ref> This is known as special majority. There is no provision for a [[joint sitting]] in case of disagreement between the two Houses. The Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the provision to article 368, it must be [[Ratification|ratified]] by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. Although there is no prescribed time limit for ratification, it must be completed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nEvery constitutional amendment is formulated as a statute. The first amendment is called the \"Constitution (First Amendment) Act\", the second, the \"Constitution (Second Amendment) Act\", and so forth. Each usually has the long title \"An Act further to amend the Constitution of India\".\n\n===Types of amendments===\nThe original constitution provided for three categories of amendments. The first category of amendments are those contemplated in articles 4 (2), 169, 239A (2), 239AA (7b), 243M (4b), 243ZC (3), 244A (4), 356 (1)c, para 7(2) of Schedule V and para 21(2) of Schedule VI.<ref name=\"text\">{{cite web|title=Full text of the Constitution of India|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621134720/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-21|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> These amendments can be effected by Parliament by a [[Plurality voting system|simple majority]] such as that required for the passing of any ordinary law. The amendments under this category are specifically excluded from the purview of article 368 which is the specific provision in the Constitution dealing with the power and the procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 4]] provides that laws made by Parliament under article 2 (relating to admission or establishment of new States) and [[Part One of the Constitution of India|article 3]] (relating to formation of new States and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing States) effecting amendments in the First Schedule or the Fourth Schedule and supplemental, incidental and consequential matters, shall not be deemed to be amendments of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. For example, the ''[[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]]'', which brought about the reorganization of the States in India, was passed by Parliament as an ordinary piece of legislation. In ''Mangal Singh v. Union of India'' (A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 944), the Supreme Court held that power to reduce the total number of members of Legislative Assembly below the minimum prescribed under article 170 (1) is implicit in the authority to make laws under article 4. Article 169 empowers Parliament to provide by law for the abolition or creation of the [[Vidhan Parishad|Legislative Councils]] in States and specifies that though such law shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the Constitution as may be necessary, it shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. ''The Legislative Councils Act, 1957'', which provided for the creation of a Legislative Council in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and for increasing the strength of the Legislative Councils in certain other States, is an example of a law passed by Parliament in an exercise of its powers under article 169. The Fifth Schedule contains provisions as to the administration and control of the Schedule Areas and [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. Para 7 of the Schedule vests Parliament with plenary powers to enact laws amending the Schedule and lays down that no such law shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. Under Para 21 of the Sixth Schedule, Parliament has full power to enact laws amending the Sixth Schedule which contains provisions for the administration of Tribal Areas in the States of [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]]. No such law will be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368.\n\nThe second category includes amendments that can be effected by Parliament by a prescribed \u2018[[Supermajority|special majority]]\u2019; and the third category of amendments includes those that require, in addition to such \"special majority\", ratification by at least one-half of the State Legislatures. The last two categories are governed by article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nAmbedkar speaking in the Constituent Assembly on 17 September 1949, pointed out that there were \"innumerable articles in the Constitution\" which left matters subject to laws made by Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly Debates - Volume IX|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|work=India Kanoon|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=1660|date=17 September 1949|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012448/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Under article 11, Parliament may make any provision relating to citizenship notwithstanding anything in article 5 to 10. Thus, by passing ordinary laws, Parliament may, in effect, provide, modify or annul the operation of certain provisions of the Constitution without actually amending them within the meaning of article 368. Since such laws do not, in fact, make any change whatsoever in the letter of the Constitution, they cannot be regarded as amendments of the Constitution nor categorized as such. Other examples include Part XXI of the Constitution\u2014\"Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions\" whereby \"Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution\" power is given to Parliament to make laws with respect to certain matters included in the State List (article 369); article 370 (1) (d) which empowers the President to modify, by order, provisions of the Constitution in their application to the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]; provisos to articles 83 (2) and 172 (1) empower Parliament to extend the lives of the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly of every State beyond a period of five years during the operation of a Proclamation of Emergency; and articles 83(1) and 172 (2) provide that the Council of States/Legislative Council of a State shall not be subject to dissolution but as nearly as possible one-t\n\n===Amendments under article 368===\nPart-xx Article 368 (1) of the Constitution of India grants constituent power to make formal amendments and  empowers Parliament to amend the Constitution by way of addition, variation or repeal of any provision according to the procedure laid down therein, which is different from the procedure for ordinary legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|title= constituent power versus legislative power|accessdate= 23 August 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150826234901/http://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|archive-date= 26 August 2015|url-status= live}}</ref> Article 368 has been amended by the 24th and 42nd Amendments in 1971 and 1976 respectively.

The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting. There is no provision for a joint sitting in case of disagreement between the two Houses. Total membership in this context has been defined to mean the total number of members comprising the House irrespective of any vacancies or absentees on any account vide Explanation to Rule 159 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368, it must be ratified by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. These provisions relate to certain matters concerning the federal structure or of common interest to both the Union and the States viz., the election of the President (articles 54 and 55); the extent of the executive power of the Union and the States (articles 73 and 162); the High Courts for Union territories (article 241); The Union Judiciary and the High Courts in the States (Chapter IV of Part V and Chapter V of Part VI); the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States (Chapter I of Part XI and Seventh Schedule); the representation of States in Parliament; and the provision for amendment of the Constitution laid down in article 368.

There are gaps in the procedure as to how and after what notice a Bill is to be introduced, how it is to be passed by each House and how the President's assent is to be obtained. This point was decided by the Supreme Court in ''Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India'' (AIR 1951 SC 458). Delivering the judgment, Patanjali Sastri J. observed, \"Having provided for the constitution of a Parliament and prescribed a certain procedure for the conduct of its ordinary legislative business to be supplemented by rules made by each House (article 118), the makers of the Constitution must be taken to have intended Parliament to follow that procedure, so far as it may be applicable consistently with the express provisions of article 368, when they entrusted to it power of amending the Constitution.\" Hence, barring the requirements of special majority, ratification by the State Legislatures in certain cases, and the mandatory assent by the President, a Bill for amending the Constitution is dealt with the Parliament following the same legislative process as applicable to an ordinary piece of legislation. The Rules of the House in the Rajya Sabha do not contain special provisions with regard to Bills for the amendment of the Constitution and the Rules relating to ordinary Bills apply, subject to the requirements of article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business make certain specific provisions regarding amendment bills in the Lok Sabha. They relate to the voting procedure in the House at various stages of such Bills, in the light of the requirements of article 368; and the procedure before introduction in the case of such Bills, if sponsored by Private Members. Although the \"special majority\", required by article 368 is prima facie applicable only to the voting at the final stage, the Lok Sabha Rules prescribe adherence to this constitutional requirement at all the effective stages of the Bill, i.e., for adoption of the motion that the Bill be taken into consideration; that the Bill as reported by the Select/Joint Committee be taken into consideration, in case a Bill has been referred to a Committee; for adoption of each clause or schedule or clause or schedule as amended, of a Bill; or that the Bill or the Bill as amended, as the case may be, be passed.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\">{{cite book|title=Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha|year=2004|publisher=Lok Sabha Secretariat|location=New Delhi|page=67|edition=Eleventh|chapter=Rules 155 and 157}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThis provision was arrived at after consultation with the Attorney-General and detailed discussions in the Rules Committee. It has been described as \"evidently ''ex abundanti cautela''\", a Latin phrase, which in law, describes someone taking precautions against a very remote contingency.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>Gray, John (2006), ''\"Lawyer's Latin (a vade-mecum)\"'', Hale, London, {{ISBN|9780709082774}}.</ref> By strictly adhering to article 368, the provision is intended to ensure the validity of the procedure adopted, but also guard against the possibility of violation of the spirit and scheme of that article 29 by the consideration of a Bill seeking to amend the Constitution including its consideration clause by clause being concluded in the House with only the bare quorum present. Voting at all the above stages is by division. However, the Speaker may, with the concurrence of the House, put any group of clauses or schedules together to the vote of the House, provided that the Speaker will permit any of the clauses or schedules be put separately, if any member requests that. The Short Title, Enacting Formula and the Long Title are adopted by a simple majority. The adoption of amendments to clauses or schedules of the Bill, requires a majority of members present and voting in the same manner as in the case of any other Bill.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\"/>\n\n====Private Members' Bills====\nA Bill for amendment of the Constitution by a Private Member is governed by the rules applicable to Private Members' Bills in general. The period of one month's notice applies to such a Bill also. In addition, in Lok Sabha, such a Bill has to be examined and recommended by the Committee on Private Members\u2019 Bills before it is included in the List of Business. The Committee has laid down the following principles as guiding criteria in making their recommendations in regard to these Bills:\n\n{{quote|\n\"(i) The Constitution should be considered as a sacred document \u2014 a document which should not be lightly interfered with and it should be amended only when it is found absolutely necessary to do so. Such amendments may generally be brought forward when it is found that the interpretation of the various articles and provisions of the Constitution has not been in accordance with the intention behind such provisions and cases of lacunae or glaring inconsistencies have come to light. Such amendments should, however, normally be brought by the Government after considering the matter in all its aspects and consulting experts, and taking such other advice as they may deem fit.<br />\n(ii) Some time should elapse before a proper assessment of the working of the Constitution and its general effect is made so that any amendments that may be necessary are suggested as a result of sufficient experience.<br />\n(iii) Generally speaking, notice of Bills from Private Members should be examined in the background of the proposal or measures which the Government may be considering at the time so that consolidated proposals are brought forward before the House by the Government after collecting sufficient material and taking expert advice.<br />\n(iv) Whenever a Private Member\u2019s Bill raises issues of far-reaching importance and public interest, the Bill might be allowed to be introduced so that public opinion is ascertained and gauged to enable the House to consider the matter further. In determining whether a matter is of sufficient public importance, it should be examined whether the particular provisions in the Constitution are adequate to satisfy the current ideas and public demand at the time. In other words, the Constitution should be adapted to the current needs and demands of the progressive society and any rigidity which may impede progress should be avoided.\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>}}\n\n===Role of state legislatures===\nThe role of the states in constitutional amendment is limited. State legislatures cannot initiate any Bill or proposal for amendment of the Constitution. They are associated in the process of the amendment only through the ratification procedure laid down in article 368, in case the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368. The only other provision for constitutional changes by state legislatures is to initiate the process for creating or abolishing Legislative Councils in their respective legislatures, and to give their views on a proposed Parliamentary bill seeking to affect the area, boundaries or name of any State or States which has been referred to them under the proviso to [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 3]]. However, this referral does not restrict Parliament's power to make any further amendments of the Bill.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nArticle 169 (1) reads, \"Notwithstanding anything in article 168, Parliament may by law provide for the abolition of the Legislative Council of a State having such a Council or for the creation of such a Council in a State having no such Council, if the Legislative Assembly of the State passes a resolution to that effect by a majority of the total membership of the Assembly and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of the Assembly present and voting.\" The proviso of article 3 provides that no bill for the purpose shall be introduced in either House of Parliament except on the recommendation of the President and unless, where the proposal contained in the Bill affects the area, boundaries or name of any of the States, the bill has been referred by the President to the Legislature of the State for expressing its views thereon within such period as may be specified in the reference or within such further period as the President may allow and the period so specified or allowed has expired.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n===Role of Union territories===\nUnion territories have no say in constitutional amendments, including the ratification process which is only open to States. [[Delhi]] and [[Puducherry]] are two union territories that are entitled, by special constitutional amendments, to have an elected Legislative Assembly and a Cabinet of ministers, thereby enjoying partial statehood powers. Both of these territories can participate in the ratification process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|title=Third non-BJP state Delhi ratifies 'big reform' GST bill {{!}} Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=2016-08-24|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028145535/http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|archive-date=28 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n==Limitations==\n{{Main|Basic structure doctrine}}\nThe Constitution can be amended any number of times by the Parliament; but only in the manner provided. There is no such limit provided in the constitution of India which allows it to enact only certain number of amendments in a year. In other words, Parliament is free to enact any number of constitutional amendment in any given year. Although Parliament must preserve the basic framework of the Constitution, there is no other limitation placed upon the amending power, meaning that there is no provision of the Constitution that cannot be amended. In ''Abdul Rahiman Jamaluddin v. Vithal Arjun (''AIR 1958 Bombay, 94, (1957)), the Bombay High Court held that any attempt to amend the Constitution by a Legislature other than Parliament, and in a manner different from that provided for, will be void and inoperative.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court first struck down a constitutional amendment in 1967, ruling in the case of ''[[I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr.|I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr]]''. An amendment was struck down on the basis that it violated Article 13: \"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by [the charter of Fundamental Rights]\". The term \"law\" in this article was interpreted as including a constitutional amendment. Parliament responded by enacting the twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India which declared that \"nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution\".\n\nThe current limitation on amendments comes from ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala]]'', where the Supreme Court ruled that amendments of the constitution must respect the \"[[basic structure]]\" of the constitution, and certain fundamental features of the constitution cannot be altered by amendment. Parliament attempted to remove this limitation by enacting the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|Forty-second Amendment]], which declared, among other provisions, that \"there shall be no limitation whatever on the constituent power of Parliament to amend ...this Constitution\". However, this change was itself later declared invalid by the Supreme Court in ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]''.\n\nThe issue of whether an entire constitutional amendment is void for want of ratification or only an amended provision required to be ratified under proviso to clause (2) of article 368 was debated before the Supreme Court in ''Kihota Hollohon v. Zachilhu ''(AIR 1993 SC 412), in which the constitutional validity of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution inserted by the 52nd Amendment in 1985 was challenged.  The decisions of the Speakers/Chairmen on disqualification, which had been challenged in different High Courts through different petitions, were heard by a five-member Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. The case, now popularly known as Anti-Defection case, was decided in 1992. The Constitution Bench in its majority judgement upheld the validity of the Tenth Schedule, but declared Paragraph 7 of the Schedule invalid because it was not ratified by the required number of the Legislatures of the States as it brought about in terms and effect, a change in articles 136, 226 and 227 of the Constitution. While doing so, the majority treated Paragraph 7 as a severable part from the rest of the Schedule. However, in the [[dissenting opinion]], the minority of the Judges held that the entire Amendment is invalid for want of ratification.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n==Parts frequently amended==\n{{See also|List of amendments of the Constitution of India}}\n[[File:India constitutional amendments per decade.JPG|thumb|250px|right| Number of constitutional amendments in India per decade.<ref name=\"ncert\">{{cite book  |last=Sharma |first=Dinesh |author2=Singh, Jaya|author3= Maganathan, R.|title=Indian Constitution at Work |publisher=[[National Council of Educational Research and Training|NCERT]] |year=2002 |series=Political Science, Class XI|display-authors=etal}}</ref>]]\nDespite the [[super majority]] requirement in the Constitution, it is one of the most frequently amended governing documents in the world, and the most amended national constitution in the world;<ref name=\"Krishnamurthy2009\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |page=219 |title=Colonial Cousins: Explaining India and Canada\u2019s Unwritten Constitutional Principles |last=Krishnamurthi |first=Vivek |date=2009 |volume=34 |issue=1 |journal=[[Yale Journal of International Law]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075730/http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> amendments have averaged about two a year. This is partly because the Constitution is so specific in spelling out government powers that amendments are often required to deal with matters that could be addressed by ordinary statutes in other democracies. As a result, it is the longest constitution of any sovereign nation in the world. It currently consists of over 117,000 words (450 articles plus 104 amendments). Another reason is that the Parliament of India is elected by means of single seat districts, under the [[plurality voting system]], used in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. This means that, it is possible for a party to win two thirds of the seats in Parliament without securing two thirds of the vote. For example, in the first two [[Lok Sabha]] elections held under the Constitution, the [[Indian National Congress]] party won less than one half of the national vote but roughly two thirds of seats in the chamber.\n\n===Fundamental Rights===\nThe most important and frequent reason for amendments to the Constitution is the curtailment of the [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Rights]] charter. This is achieved by inserting laws contrary to the fundamental rights provisions into Schedule 9 of the Constitution. Schedule 9 protects such laws from [[judicial review]]. The typical areas of restriction include laws relating to property rights, and affirmative action in favour of minority groups such as the \"scheduled castes\", \"scheduled tribes\", and other \"backward classes\" and also lower classes people.\n\nIn a [[landmark ruling]] in January 2007, a nine judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court of India confirmed that all laws (including those in Schedule 9) would be open to judicial review if they violate the \"basic structure of the constitution\".<ref name=\"Basic structure now ironcast\">{{cite news|title=Basic structure now ironcast|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=12 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402222003/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|archive-date=2 April 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal|Chief Justice Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal]] noted, \"If laws put in the Ninth Schedule abridge or abrogate fundamental rights resulting in violation of the basic structure of the constitution, such laws need to be invalidated\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|title=India court opens laws to review|author=|date=4 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413031110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|archive-date=13 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Territorial changes===\n\nConstitutional amendments have been made to facilitate changes in the territorial extent of the Republic of India due to the incorporation of the former French colony of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], the former Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], and a minor exchange of territory with [[Pakistan]]. Amendments are also necessary with regard to littoral rights over the exclusive economic zone of 200&nbsp;mi and the formation of new states and union territories by the reorganization of existing states. Constitutional amendment under article 368 allows peaceful division of the country provided [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental rights]] (Article 13) are ensured in all the resultant countries. The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 is an example which has ceded territory to old Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |title= The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 |accessdate= 23 March 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080125225558/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |archive-date= 25 January 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n===Transitional provisions===\n\nThe constitution includes transitional provisions intended to remain in force only for a limited period. These need to be renewed periodically. For example, for continuing reservation in parliamentary seats for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes a constitutional amendment is enacted once in every ten years.\n\n===Democratic reform===\n\nAmendments have been made with the intent of reform the system of government and incorporating new \"checks and balances\" in the Constitution. These have included the following:\n\n* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.\n* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.\n* Creation of mechanisms for ''[[Panchayati Raj]]'' (local self governance).\n* Disqualification of members from changing party allegiance.\n* Restrictions on the size of the cabinet.\n* Restrictions on imposition of an internal emergency.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of amendments of the Constitution of India]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160416084719/http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-4March2016.pdf Full text of the Constitution of India] (as of November 2015)\n* [http://constitution-of-india.pykih.com/ Pykih Data Visualization of Constitutional Amendments]\n\n[[Category:Constitution of India]]\n[[Category:Amendments of the Constitution of India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Process of amending India's constitution}}{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=November 2018}}\n'''Amending the Constitution of India''' is the process of making changes to the nation's fundamental law or supreme law. The procedure of amendment in the constitution is laid down in Part XX (Article 368) of the [[Constitution of India]]. This procedure  ensures the sanctity of the Constitution of India and keeps a check on arbitrary power of the [[Parliament of India]].\n\nHowever, there is another limitation imposed on the amending power of the constitution of India, which developed during conflicts between the [[Supreme Court of India|Supreme Court]] and Parliament, where Parliament wants to exercise discretionary use of power to amend the constitution while the Supreme Court wants to restrict that power.\nThis has led to the laying down of various doctrines or rules in regard to checking the validity/legality of an amendment, the most famous among them is the [[Basic structure doctrine]] as laid down by the Supreme Court in the case of [[Kesavananda Bharati vs State of Kerala]] .\n\n==Constituent Assembly debates==\nThe framers of the Constitution were neither in favour of the traditional theory of [[federalism]], which entrusts the task of constitutional amendment to a body other than the Legislature, nor did they favour a rigid special procedure for such amendments. They also never wanted to have a British-style system where [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] is supreme. The framers, instead, adopted a combination of the \"theory of fundamental law\", which underlies the written [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]] with the \"theory of parliamentary sovereignty\" as existing in the [[United Kingdom]]. The Constitution of India vests constituent power upon the Parliament subject to the special procedure laid down therein.<ref name=\"Nature and Scope\">{{cite web|title=Constitution Amendment: Nature and Scope of the Amending Process|url=http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|work=Lok Sabha Secretariat|accessdate=1 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203013055/http://164.100.47.134/intranet/CAI/1.pdf|archive-date=2013-12-03|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDuring the discussion in the [[Constituent Assembly of India|Constituent Assembly]] on this aspect, some members were in favour of adopting an easier mode of amending procedure for the initial five to ten years. Explaining why it was necessary to introduce an element of flexibility in the Constitution, [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] observed in the Constituent Assembly on 8 November 1948, \"While we want this Constitution to be as solid and as permanent a structure as we can make it, nevertheless there is no permanence in Constitutions. There should be a certain flexibility. If you make anything rigid and permanent, you stop a nation\u2019s growth, the growth of a living, vital, organic people. Therefore, it has to be flexible ... while we, who are assembled in this House, undoubtedly represent the people of India, nevertheless I think it can be said, and truthfully, that when a new House, by whatever name it goes, is elected in terms of this Constitution, and every adult in India has the right to vote - man and woman - the House that emerges then will certainly be fully representative of every section of the Indian people. It is right that House elected so - under this Constitution of course it will have the right to do anything - should have an easy opportunity to make such changes as it wants to. But in any event, we should not make a Constitution, such as some other great countries have, which are so rigid that they do not and cannot be adapted easily to changing conditions. Today especially, when the world is in turmoil and we are passing through a very swift period of transition, what we may do today may not be wholly applicable tomorrow. Therefore, while we make a Constitution which is sound and as basic as we can, it should also be flexible ...\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly of India Debates (Proceedings) - Vol. VII|url=http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|accessdate=1 December 2013|pages=322\u2013323|date=8 November 1948|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103153825/http://164.100.47.132/LssNew/constituent/vol7p4.html|archive-date=3 November 2011|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nDr. P.S. Deshmukh believed that the amendment of the Constitution should be made easier as he felt there were contradictory provisions in some places which would be more and more apparent when the provisions were interpreted, and that the whole administration would suffer, if the amendment to the Constitution was not made easy. Brajeshwar Prasad also favoured a flexible Constitution so as to make it survive the test of time. He was of the opinion that rigidity tends to check progressive legislation or gradual innovation. On the other hand, H.V. Kamath favoured ensuring procedural safeguards to avoid the possibility of hasty amendment to the Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n{{quotation|\"It is said that the provisions contained in the Draft make amendment difficult. It is proposed that the Constitution should be amendable by a simple majority at least for some years. The argument is subtle and ingenious. It is said that this Constituent Assembly is not elected on adult suffrage while the future Parliament will be elected on adult suffrage and yet the former has been given the right to pass the Constitution by a simple majority while the latter has been denied the same right. It is paraded as one of the absurdities of the Draft Constitution. I must repudiate the charge because it is without foundation. To know how simple are the provisions of the Draft Constitution in respect of amending the Constitution one has only to study the provisions for amendment contained in the American and Australian Constitutions. Compared to them those contained in the Draft Constitution will be found to be the simplest. The Draft Constitution has eliminated the elaborate and difficult procedures such as a decision by a convention or a referendum ... It is only for amendments of specific matters\u2014and they are only few\u2014that the ratification of the State Legislatures is required. All other Articles of the Constitution are left to be amended by Parliament. The only limitation is that it shall be done by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of each House present and voting and a majority of the total membership of each House. It is difficult to conceive a simpler method of amending the Constitution.\n\nWhat is said to be the absurdity of the amending provisions is founded upon a misconception of the position of the Constituent Assembly and of the future Parliament elected under the Constitution. The Constituent Assembly in making a Constitution has no partisan motive. Beyond securing a good and workable Constitution it has no axe to grind. In considering the Articles of the Constitution it has no eye on getting through a particular measure. The future Parliament if it met as Constituent Assembly, its members will be acting as partisans seeking to carry amendments to the Constitution to facilitate the passing of party measures which they have failed to get through Parliament by reason of some Article of the Constitution which has acted as an obstacle in their way. Parliament will have an axe to grind while the Constituent Assembly has none. That is the difference between the Constituent Assembly and the future Parliament. That explains why the Constituent Assembly though elected on limited franchise can be trusted to pass the Constitution by simple majority and why the Parliament though elected on adult suffrage cannot be trusted with the same power to amend it.\"\n|[[B. R. Ambedkar]], speaking in the Constituent Assembly on 4 November 1948<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n}}\n\n==Procedure==\nThe Constitution of India provides for a distinctive amendment process when compared to the Constitutions of other nations. This can be described as partly flexible and partly rigid. The Constitution provides for a variety in the amending process. This feature has been commended by Australian academic Sir [[Kenneth Wheare]] who felt that uniformity in the amending process imposed \"quite unnecessary restrictions\" upon the amendment of parts of a Constitution.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/> An amendment of the Constitution can be initiated only by the introduction of a [[Bill (law)|Bill]] in either [[Parliament of India|House of Parliament]]. The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting.<ref>http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108220111/http://parliamentofindia.nic.in/ls/intro/p5.htm |date=8 November 2012 }} {{PD-notice}}</ref> This is known as special majority. There is no provision for a [[joint sitting]] in case of disagreement between the two Houses. The Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the provision to article 368, it must be [[Ratification|ratified]] by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. Although there is no prescribed time limit for ratification, it must be completed before the amending Bill is presented to the President for his assent.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nEvery constitutional amendment is formulated as a statute. The first amendment is called the \"Constitution (First Amendment) Act\", the second, the \"Constitution (Second Amendment) Act\", and so forth. Each usually has the long title \"An Act further to amend the Constitution of India\".\n\n===Types of amendments===\nThe original constitution provided for three categories of amendments. The first category of amendments are those contemplated in articles 4 (2), 169, 239A (2), 239AA (7b), 243M (4b), 243ZC (3), 244A (4), 356 (1)c, para 7(2) of Schedule V and para 21(2) of Schedule VI.<ref name=\"text\">{{cite web|title=Full text of the Constitution of India|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|accessdate=11 August 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621134720/http://lawmin.nic.in/coi/coiason29july08.pdf|archive-date=2014-06-21|url-status=dead|df=}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> These amendments can be effected by Parliament by a [[Plurality voting system|simple majority]] such as that required for the passing of any ordinary law. The amendments under this category are specifically excluded from the purview of article 368 which is the specific provision in the Constitution dealing with the power and the procedure for the amendment of the Constitution. [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 4]] provides that laws made by Parliament under article 2 (relating to admission or establishment of new States) and [[Part One of the Constitution of India|article 3]] (relating to formation of new States and alteration of areas, boundaries or names of existing States) effecting amendments in the First Schedule or the Fourth Schedule and supplemental, incidental and consequential matters, shall not be deemed to be amendments of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. For example, the ''[[States Reorganisation Act, 1956]]'', which brought about the reorganization of the States in India, was passed by Parliament as an ordinary piece of legislation. In ''Mangal Singh v. Union of India'' (A.I.R. 1967 S.C. 944), the Supreme Court held that power to reduce the total number of members of Legislative Assembly below the minimum prescribed under article 170 (1) is implicit in the authority to make laws under article 4. Article 169 empowers Parliament to provide by law for the abolition or creation of the [[Vidhan Parishad|Legislative Councils]] in States and specifies that though such law shall contain such provisions for the amendment of the Constitution as may be necessary, it shall not be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. ''The Legislative Councils Act, 1957'', which provided for the creation of a Legislative Council in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and for increasing the strength of the Legislative Councils in certain other States, is an example of a law passed by Parliament in an exercise of its powers under article 169. The Fifth Schedule contains provisions as to the administration and control of the Schedule Areas and [[Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes|Scheduled Tribes]]. Para 7 of the Schedule vests Parliament with plenary powers to enact laws amending the Schedule and lays down that no such law shall be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368. Under Para 21 of the Sixth Schedule, Parliament has full power to enact laws amending the Sixth Schedule which contains provisions for the administration of Tribal Areas in the States of [[Assam]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Tripura]] and [[Mizoram]]. No such law will be deemed to be an amendment of the Constitution for the purposes of article 368.\n\nThe second category includes amendments that can be effected by Parliament by a prescribed \u2018[[Supermajority|special majority]]\u2019; and the third category of amendments includes those that require, in addition to such \"special majority\", ratification by at least one-half of the State Legislatures. The last two categories are governed by article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nAmbedkar speaking in the Constituent Assembly on 17 September 1949, pointed out that there were \"innumerable articles in the Constitution\" which left matters subject to laws made by Parliament.<ref>{{cite web|title=Constituent Assembly Debates - Volume IX|url=http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|work=India Kanoon|accessdate=1 December 2013|page=1660|date=17 September 1949|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203012448/http://www.indiankanoon.org/doc/487574/|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> Under article 11, Parliament may make any provision relating to citizenship notwithstanding anything in article 5 to 10. Thus, by passing ordinary laws, Parliament may, in effect, provide, modify or annul the operation of certain provisions of the Constitution without actually amending them within the meaning of article 368. Since such laws do not, in fact, make any change whatsoever in the letter of the Constitution, they cannot be regarded as amendments of the Constitution nor categorized as such. Other examples include Part XXI of the Constitution\u2014\"Temporary, Transitional and Special Provisions\" whereby \"Notwithstanding anything in this Constitution\" power is given to Parliament to make laws with respect to certain matters included in the State List (article 369); article 370 (1) (d) which empowers the President to modify, by order, provisions of the Constitution in their application to the State of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]; provisos to articles 83 (2) and 172 (1) empower Parliament to extend the lives of the House of the People and the Legislative Assembly of every State beyond a period of five years during the operation of a Proclamation of Emergency; and articles 83(1) and 172 (2) provide that the Council of States/Legislative Council of a State shall not be subject to dissolution but as nearly as possible one-t\n\n===Amendments under article 368===\nPart-xx Article 368 (1) of the Constitution of India grants constituent power to make formal amendments and  empowers Parliament to amend the Constitution by way of addition, variation or repeal of any provision according to the procedure laid down therein, which is different from the procedure for ordinary legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|title= constituent power versus legislative power|accessdate= 23 August 2014|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150826234901/http://www.academia.edu/4237119/Taming_the_tension_between_constituent_power_and_constituted_power_in_constitution_making_thoughts_on_delegability_of_constituent_power|archive-date= 26 August 2015|url-status= live}}</ref> Article 368 has been amended by the 24th and 42nd Amendments in 1971 and 1976 respectively.

The Bill must then be passed in each House by a majority of the total membership of that House and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of that House present and voting. There is no provision for a joint sitting in case of disagreement between the two Houses. Total membership in this context has been defined to mean the total number of members comprising the House irrespective of any vacancies or absentees on any account vide Explanation to Rule 159 of the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Bill, passed by the required majority, is then presented to the President who shall give his assent to the Bill. If the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368, it must be ratified by the Legislatures of not less than one-half of the States. These provisions relate to certain matters concerning the federal structure or of common interest to both the Union and the States viz., the election of the President (articles 54 and 55); the extent of the executive power of the Union and the States (articles 73 and 162); the High Courts for Union territories (article 241); The Union Judiciary and the High Courts in the States (Chapter IV of Part V and Chapter V of Part VI); the distribution of legislative powers between the Union and the States (Chapter I of Part XI and Seventh Schedule); the representation of States in Parliament; and the provision for amendment of the Constitution laid down in article 368. Ratification is done by a resolution passed by the State Legislatures. There is no specific time limit for the ratification of an amending Bill by the State Legislatures.

There are gaps in the procedure as to how and after what notice a Bill is to be introduced, how it is to be passed by each House and how the President's assent is to be obtained. This point was decided by the Supreme Court in ''Shankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India'' (AIR 1951 SC 458). Delivering the judgment, Patanjali Sastri J. observed, \"Having provided for the constitution of a Parliament and prescribed a certain procedure for the conduct of its ordinary legislative business to be supplemented by rules made by each House (article 118), the makers of the Constitution must be taken to have intended Parliament to follow that procedure, so far as it may be applicable consistently with the express provisions of article 368, when they entrusted to it power of amending the Constitution.\" Hence, barring the requirements of special majority, ratification by the State Legislatures in certain cases, and the mandatory assent by the President, a Bill for amending the Constitution is dealt with the Parliament following the same legislative process as applicable to an ordinary piece of legislation. The Rules of the House in the Rajya Sabha do not contain special provisions with regard to Bills for the amendment of the Constitution and the Rules relating to ordinary Bills apply, subject to the requirements of article 368.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business make certain specific provisions regarding amendment bills in the Lok Sabha. They relate to the voting procedure in the House at various stages of such Bills, in the light of the requirements of article 368; and the procedure before introduction in the case of such Bills, if sponsored by Private Members. Although the \"special majority\", required by article 368 is prima facie applicable only to the voting at the final stage, the Lok Sabha Rules prescribe adherence to this constitutional requirement at all the effective stages of the Bill, i.e., for adoption of the motion that the Bill be taken into consideration; that the Bill as reported by the Select/Joint Committee be taken into consideration, in case a Bill has been referred to a Committee; for adoption of each clause or schedule or clause or schedule as amended, of a Bill; or that the Bill or the Bill as amended, as the case may be, be passed.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\">{{cite book|title=Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in Lok Sabha|year=2004|publisher=Lok Sabha Secretariat|location=New Delhi|page=67|edition=Eleventh|chapter=Rules 155 and 157}} {{PD-notice}}</ref>\n\nThis provision was arrived at after consultation with the Attorney-General and detailed discussions in the Rules Committee. It has been described as \"evidently ''ex abundanti cautela''\", a Latin phrase, which in law, describes someone taking precautions against a very remote contingency.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/><ref>Gray, John (2006), ''\"Lawyer's Latin (a vade-mecum)\"'', Hale, London, {{ISBN|9780709082774}}.</ref> By strictly adhering to article 368, the provision is intended to ensure the validity of the procedure adopted, but also guard against the possibility of violation of the spirit and scheme of that article 29 by the consideration of a Bill seeking to amend the Constitution including its consideration clause by clause being concluded in the House with only the bare quorum present. Voting at all the above stages is by division. However, the Speaker may, with the concurrence of the House, put any group of clauses or schedules together to the vote of the House, provided that the Speaker will permit any of the clauses or schedules be put separately, if any member requests that. The Short Title, Enacting Formula and the Long Title are adopted by a simple majority. The adoption of amendments to clauses or schedules of the Bill, requires a majority of members present and voting in the same manner as in the case of any other Bill.<ref name = \"Lok Sabha Rules\"/>\n\n====Private Members' Bills====\nA Bill for amendment of the Constitution by a Private Member is governed by the rules applicable to Private Members' Bills in general. The period of one month's notice applies to such a Bill also. In addition, in Lok Sabha, such a Bill has to be examined and recommended by the Committee on Private Members\u2019 Bills before it is included in the List of Business. The Committee has laid down the following principles as guiding criteria in making their recommendations in regard to these Bills:\n\n{{quote|\n\"(i) The Constitution should be considered as a sacred document \u2014 a document which should not be lightly interfered with and it should be amended only when it is found absolutely necessary to do so. Such amendments may generally be brought forward when it is found that the interpretation of the various articles and provisions of the Constitution has not been in accordance with the intention behind such provisions and cases of lacunae or glaring inconsistencies have come to light. Such amendments should, however, normally be brought by the Government after considering the matter in all its aspects and consulting experts, and taking such other advice as they may deem fit.<br />\n(ii) Some time should elapse before a proper assessment of the working of the Constitution and its general effect is made so that any amendments that may be necessary are suggested as a result of sufficient experience.<br />\n(iii) Generally speaking, notice of Bills from Private Members should be examined in the background of the proposal or measures which the Government may be considering at the time so that consolidated proposals are brought forward before the House by the Government after collecting sufficient material and taking expert advice.<br />\n(iv) Whenever a Private Member\u2019s Bill raises issues of far-reaching importance and public interest, the Bill might be allowed to be introduced so that public opinion is ascertained and gauged to enable the House to consider the matter further. In determining whether a matter is of sufficient public importance, it should be examined whether the particular provisions in the Constitution are adequate to satisfy the current ideas and public demand at the time. In other words, the Constitution should be adapted to the current needs and demands of the progressive society and any rigidity which may impede progress should be avoided.\"<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>}}\n\n===Role of state legislatures===\nThe role of the states in constitutional amendment is limited. State legislatures cannot initiate any Bill or proposal for amendment of the Constitution. They are associated in the process of the amendment only through the ratification procedure laid down in article 368, in case the amendment seeks to make any change in any of the provisions mentioned in the proviso to article 368. The only other provision for constitutional changes by state legislatures is to initiate the process for creating or abolishing Legislative Councils in their respective legislatures, and to give their views on a proposed Parliamentary bill seeking to affect the area, boundaries or name of any State or States which has been referred to them under the proviso to [[Part One of the Constitution of India|Article 3]]. However, this referral does not restrict Parliament's power to make any further amendments of the Bill.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nArticle 169 (1) reads, \"Notwithstanding anything in article 168, Parliament may by law provide for the abolition of the Legislative Council of a State having such a Council or for the creation of such a Council in a State having no such Council, if the Legislative Assembly of the State passes a resolution to that effect by a majority of the total membership of the Assembly and by a majority of not less than two-thirds of the members of the Assembly present and voting.\" The proviso of article 3 provides that no bill for the purpose shall be introduced in either House of Parliament except on the recommendation of the President and unless, where the proposal contained in the Bill affects the area, boundaries or name of any of the States, the bill has been referred by the President to the Legislature of the State for expressing its views thereon within such period as may be specified in the reference or within such further period as the President may allow and the period so specified or allowed has expired.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n===Role of Union territories===\nUnion territories have no say in constitutional amendments, including the ratification process which is only open to States. [[Delhi]] and [[Puducherry]] are two union territories that are entitled, by special constitutional amendments, to have an elected Legislative Assembly and a Cabinet of ministers, thereby enjoying partial statehood powers. Both of these territories can participate in the ratification process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|title=Third non-BJP state Delhi ratifies 'big reform' GST bill {{!}} Latest News & Updates at Daily News & Analysis|date=2016-08-24|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-27|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161028145535/http://www.dnaindia.com/money/report-third-non-bjp-state-delhi-ratifies-big-reform-gst-bill-2248576|archive-date=28 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n==Limitations==\n{{Main|Basic structure doctrine}}\nThe Constitution can be amended any number of times by the Parliament; but only in the manner provided. There is no such limit provided in the constitution of India which allows it to enact only certain number of amendments in a year. In other words, Parliament is free to enact any number of constitutional amendment in any given year. Although Parliament must preserve the basic framework of the Constitution, there is no other limitation placed upon the amending power, meaning that there is no provision of the Constitution that cannot be amended. In ''Abdul Rahiman Jamaluddin v. Vithal Arjun (''AIR 1958 Bombay, 94, (1957)), the Bombay High Court held that any attempt to amend the Constitution by a Legislature other than Parliament, and in a manner different from that provided for, will be void and inoperative.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\nThe Supreme Court first struck down a constitutional amendment in 1967, ruling in the case of ''[[I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr.|I.C. Golak Nath and Ors. vs. State of Punjab and Anr]]''. An amendment was struck down on the basis that it violated Article 13: \"The State shall not make any law which takes away or abridges the rights conferred by [the charter of Fundamental Rights]\". The term \"law\" in this article was interpreted as including a constitutional amendment. Parliament responded by enacting the twenty-fourth Amendment of the Constitution of India which declared that \"nothing in Article 13 shall apply to any amendment of this Constitution\".\n\nThe current limitation on amendments comes from ''[[Kesavananda Bharati v. The State of Kerala]]'', where the Supreme Court ruled that amendments of the constitution must respect the \"[[basic structure]]\" of the constitution, and certain fundamental features of the constitution cannot be altered by amendment. Parliament attempted to remove this limitation by enacting the [[Forty-second Amendment of the Constitution of India|Forty-second Amendment]], which declared, among other provisions, that \"there shall be no limitation whatever on the constituent power of Parliament to amend ...this Constitution\". However, this change was itself later declared invalid by the Supreme Court in ''[[Minerva Mills v. Union of India]]''.\n\nThe issue of whether an entire constitutional amendment is void for want of ratification or only an amended provision required to be ratified under proviso to clause (2) of article 368 was debated before the Supreme Court in ''Kihota Hollohon v. Zachilhu ''(AIR 1993 SC 412), in which the constitutional validity of the Tenth Schedule of the Constitution inserted by the 52nd Amendment in 1985 was challenged.  The decisions of the Speakers/Chairmen on disqualification, which had been challenged in different High Courts through different petitions, were heard by a five-member Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court. The case, now popularly known as Anti-Defection case, was decided in 1992. The Constitution Bench in its majority judgement upheld the validity of the Tenth Schedule, but declared Paragraph 7 of the Schedule invalid because it was not ratified by the required number of the Legislatures of the States as it brought about in terms and effect, a change in articles 136, 226 and 227 of the Constitution. While doing so, the majority treated Paragraph 7 as a severable part from the rest of the Schedule. However, in the [[dissenting opinion]], the minority of the Judges held that the entire Amendment is invalid for want of ratification.<ref name = \"Nature and Scope\"/>\n\n==Parts frequently amended==\n{{See also|List of amendments of the Constitution of India}}\n[[File:India constitutional amendments per decade.JPG|thumb|250px|right| Number of constitutional amendments in India per decade.<ref name=\"ncert\">{{cite book  |last=Sharma |first=Dinesh |author2=Singh, Jaya|author3= Maganathan, R.|title=Indian Constitution at Work |publisher=[[National Council of Educational Research and Training|NCERT]] |year=2002 |series=Political Science, Class XI|display-authors=etal}}</ref>]]\nDespite the [[super majority]] requirement in the Constitution, it is one of the most frequently amended governing documents in the world, and the most amended national constitution in the world;<ref name=\"Krishnamurthy2009\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |page=219 |title=Colonial Cousins: Explaining India and Canada\u2019s Unwritten Constitutional Principles |last=Krishnamurthi |first=Vivek |date=2009 |volume=34 |issue=1 |journal=[[Yale Journal of International Law]] |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304075730/http://www.yale.edu/yjil/files_PDFs/vol34/Krishnamurthy.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-04 }}</ref> amendments have averaged about two a year. This is partly because the Constitution is so specific in spelling out government powers that amendments are often required to deal with matters that could be addressed by ordinary statutes in other democracies. As a result, it is the longest constitution of any sovereign nation in the world. It currently consists of over 117,000 words (450 articles plus 104 amendments). Another reason is that the Parliament of India is elected by means of single seat districts, under the [[plurality voting system]], used in the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]. This means that, it is possible for a party to win two thirds of the seats in Parliament without securing two thirds of the vote. For example, in the first two [[Lok Sabha]] elections held under the Constitution, the [[Indian National Congress]] party won less than one half of the national vote but roughly two thirds of seats in the chamber.\n\n===Fundamental Rights===\nThe most important and frequent reason for amendments to the Constitution is the curtailment of the [[Fundamental Rights in India|Fundamental Rights]] charter. This is achieved by inserting laws contrary to the fundamental rights provisions into Schedule 9 of the Constitution. Schedule 9 protects such laws from [[judicial review]]. The typical areas of restriction include laws relating to property rights, and affirmative action in favour of minority groups such as the \"scheduled castes\", \"scheduled tribes\", and other \"backward classes\" and also lower classes people.\n\nIn a [[landmark ruling]] in January 2007, a nine judge constitutional bench of the Supreme Court of India confirmed that all laws (including those in Schedule 9) would be open to judicial review if they violate the \"basic structure of the constitution\".<ref name=\"Basic structure now ironcast\">{{cite news|title=Basic structure now ironcast|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|accessdate=2 April 2013|newspaper=Times of India|date=12 January 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402222003/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-01-12/india/27885602_1_constitution-structure-common-man|archive-date=2 April 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> [[Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal|Chief Justice Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal]] noted, \"If laws put in the Ninth Schedule abridge or abrogate fundamental rights resulting in violation of the basic structure of the constitution, such laws need to be invalidated\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|title=India court opens laws to review|author=|date=4 April 2018|publisher=|accessdate=4 April 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413031110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6251067.stm|archive-date=13 April 2012|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Territorial changes===\n\nConstitutional amendments have been made to facilitate changes in the territorial extent of the Republic of India due to the incorporation of the former French colony of [[Puducherry|Pondicherry]], the former Portuguese colony of [[Goa]], and a minor exchange of territory with [[Pakistan]]. Amendments are also necessary with regard to littoral rights over the exclusive economic zone of 200&nbsp;mi and the formation of new states and union territories by the reorganization of existing states. Constitutional amendment under article 368 allows peaceful division of the country provided [[Fundamental Rights in India|fundamental rights]] (Article 13) are ensured in all the resultant countries. The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 is an example which has ceded territory to old Pakistan.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |title= The constitution (ninth amendment) act, 1960 |accessdate= 23 March 2014 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080125225558/http://indiacode.nic.in/coiweb/amend/amend9.htm |archive-date= 25 January 2008 |url-status= live }}</ref>\n\n===Transitional provisions===\n\nThe constitution includes transitional provisions intended to remain in force only for a limited period. These need to be renewed periodically. For example, for continuing reservation in parliamentary seats for scheduled castes and scheduled tribes an constitutional amendment is enacted once in every ten years.\n\n===Democratic reform===\n\nAmendments have been made with the intent of reform the system of government and incorporating new \"checks and balances\" in the Constitution. These have included the following:\n\n* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Castes.\n* Creation of the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes.\n* Creation of mechanisms for ''[[Panchayati Raj]]'' (local self governance).\n* Disqualification of members from changing party allegiance.\n* Restrictions on the size of the cabinet.\n* Restrictions on imposition of an internal emergency.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of amendments of the Constitution of India]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20160416084719/http://lawmin.nic.in/olwing/coi/coi-english/coi-4March2016.pdf Full text of the Constitution of India] (as of November 2015)\n* [http://constitution-of-india.pykih.com/ Pykih Data Visualization of Constitutional Amendments]\n\n[[Category:Constitution of India]]\n[[Category:Amendments of the Constitution of India]]\n", "name_user": "John of Reading", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing, replaced: an constitutional \u2192 a constitutional", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amendment_of_the_Constitution_of_India"}
