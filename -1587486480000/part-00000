One subplot involves a married couple Vaembu and Mugil, and a cop named Berlin; another plot involves Shilpa (previously Manickam), her wife Jyothi, their son Rasukutty, and Berlin the cop; the third plot involves Leela, her husband Dhanasekaran alias Arputham and their son Soori, and Mohan; and the last plot involves five friends: Balaji (Gaaji), Soori, Mohan, Vasanth (Mutta Puffs) and Thuyavan. \n\nVaembu and Mugil's plot starts at their home with the death of Vaembu's ex-boyfriend during sexual intercourse with Vaembu, while her husband Mugil was away. Mugil returns home, and is requested by the neighbors to accommodate some guests. During this ordeal Mugil finds out about the dead body, Vaembu confesses the affair and the eventual death of the ex-boyfriend, and tells her husband she will surrender to the police and accept her punishment. Mugil rejects Vaembu's suggestion, saying it would ruin him and his family's image. With the uninvited guests at home, they struggle to contain the situation. They talk about how they are both dissatisfied with their marriage. Eventually, they manage to get the corpse out of town but they are still caught by Berlin, a corrupted senior police officer. Berlin blackmails the couple for sexual favor from Vaembu, in exchange to contain the situation and get rid of the corpse. Mugil, in a confused state, tells Vaembu the consequences if they refuse, and urges her to accept the deal. Shattered, Vaembu still refuses, but realizes there are no options left them. Berlin continues to take advantage of the situation and demands his end of the deal there and then. Threatening with his gun, Berlin then instructs Vaembu to handcuff her husband to the car, and tells her to lie down. As he  advances towards Vaembu, intending to rape her, a TV hits him on his head, he collapses and dies. The couple dispose both the dead bodies. Mugil forgives Vaembu and they reconcile. \n\nShilpa's plot starts with a family eagerly expecting the return of Jyothi's husband Manickam, who absconded the family seven years ago. To their shock, Manickam arrives back from Mumbai as a trans woman named Shilpa. The family reacts in various ways to her transition. Shilpa and Jyothi's 7-year old son, Rasukutty, who has been desperately longing the return of his father wants to take Shilpa to school. Rasukutty wants to introduce Shilpha to his friends, and prove them wrong about their mockery of him for being a test-tube baby. Raskutty and Shilpa set off to the school, but on the way there Raskutty needs the toilet. While in the toilet a cop becomes suspicious of Shilpa and drags her and Rasukutty to the police station. Berlin, the same corrupt senior police officer at the station, intervenes and orally rapes Shilpa. He eventually lets Shilpa and Rasukutty go and they arrive at the school. Shilpa once more faces humiliation at the entrance of the school by the school watchmen and is refused entry. Rasukutty enters the school by himself, telling Shilpa to wait as he goes to get his friends. The school watchmen, a father of another student and a few other students continue to harass and humiliate Shilpa. Distressed and ashamed Shilpa buys tickets to return to Mumbai. On the way home from school Shilpa loses Rasukutty. Shocked and distressed Shilpa starts to search for Rasukutty desperately, again encountering Berlin in the process, but this time, they enter into a tussle when he finds out that Shilpa is bald. Shilpa curses Berlin in the style of a trans woman (their curse is feared by many to turn out true) to die. Eventually, she finds him at home. Rasukutty reveals he knows about Shilpa's intention of abandoning them again, and confronts her emotionally. Shilpa realises that Rasukutty and Jyothi accept her as she is, she cancels her plan and decides to stay with her family. \n\nThe boys' plot starts with all boys skipping school and gathering to watch pornographic film at Thuyavan's home. As soon as the porn film starts, Soori is left in shock and anger upon seeing his mother Leela in the movie. He breaks the TV in anger and runs away crying, Mohan follows to console him. Thuyavan, afraid of his father finding out about the broken TV, asks help of remaining two friends, Balaji and Vasanth, to find money to buy a new TV to replace the broken one. They accept a job from the local don, but fail miserably. On failing to cut the deal with the don, they are left with an additional burden of more lump sum requirement before EOD. They decide to steal money from a Seth. They initially sneak into his home and escape out with few currency notes. But later they find that those are old demonetized currency and plans to steal from Seth again. When they enter Seth's home again, they are confronted by a teenage girl (Mirnalini Ravi). She appears to have magical powers and strips down to reveal she is an alien. She reveals that the Seth who was lying on the sofa was her companion and has just died, and so she needs a new companion now. She takes interest in Balaji, one of the boys and clones him. One clone stays with her and the other joins his friends. The friends get the money from her and then they buy a new TV and throw away the old one which co-incidentally is the TV which hits Berlin on his head and results in his death (a result of Shilpa's curse).\n\nLeela's plot starts with Soori, who is angrily running towards her with a screwdriver upon finding out she was in a porn film.  As he is climbing the stairs to reach Leela, he trips and he stabs himself in the abdomen. He is taken to the hospital, and his father Arputham is informed about this accident. Arputham is a lone survivor from a tsunami who believes that he was saved by God in the form of a statue which he held onto when the tsunami struck. He devotes himself to this god and strongly believes that this god can cure all illness, however on this particular day he is reluctant to give service to the followers. Learning about Soori's condition, he rushes to the hospital and brings the wounded Soori back to his chapel, believing that his prayers would cure him. Then, Leela forcefully takes back Soori to the hospital and struggles to arrange medical expenses. It is revealed that Arputham, who struggles to find money, has begun to question his faith in God after a conversation with Shilpa the day before. During this conversation, Shilpa confesses she feels deep shame and guilt for snatching and delivering children to criminals that injure children and force then to beg on the streets to get money. Arputham states that her confession is the worst that he has ever heard, and there is no forgiveness for her. Shilpa decides to return home to search for her son, but before leaving tells Arputham that she too survived the tsunami by holding onto a rock too. Remembering back to this Arputham, in the present time, begins to doubt himself. He continues to pray for his son, but eventually ends up accidentally breaking the statue and finds diamonds in it. It is revealed that the diamonds are from a sunken Italian pirate ship. He uses the diamonds and saves Soori, but continues to think about his beliefs and religion.\n\nJust before the end credits, the three friends who were in pursuit of buying a new TV go to watch a porn movie at the theater. The movie starts with a doctor speaking about the existence of life and then a sequence of scenes follows where various characters explain the origin of life, the design pattern and similarity of universe, solar system and atomic structure of atoms. And finally the movie ends with the opening title of the porn movie which is \"Vaazhvin Ragasiyam\" (The Secret of Life).\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay Sethupathi]] as Shilpa (Manickam), a transgender woman who returns home to her wife and son after transitioning\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Mugil, Vaembu\u2019s husband who is devastated after he is cheated on but helps her to hide the body of her dead ex-boyfriend\n* [[Samantha Akkineni|Samantha]] as Vaembu, Mugil\u2019s wife who engages in scandalous intercourse with her ex-boyfriend, who suddenly dies in bed with her\n* [[Ramya Krishnan]] as Leela, a pornographic actress whose son accidentally injures himself after he finds out his mother\u2019s profession and attempts to injure her\n* [[Gayathrie]] as Jyothi, Shilpa\u2019s wife, who is devastated to find out that her husband is transgender\n* [[Mysskin]] as Arputham (Dhanasekaran), Leela\u2019s husband and a syncretic preacher who relies on religious healing to save his injured son\n* [[Bagavathi Perumal]] as Berlin, a corrupt sub-inspector who expresses lust for Shilpa and later Vaembu (main antagonist)\n* Ramana as Ramasamy\n* Vijay Ram as Balaji (Gaaji)\n* [[Mirnalini Ravi]] as Seth Girl (Alien)\n* Naveen as Soori\n* Jayanth as Mohan\n* Abdul Jabbar as Thuyavan\n* Noble K.

He wrote \"This is an utterly unique film, a brave film. While watching Super Deluxe, I felt what Pauline Kael described in her review of [[The Godfather Part II]]: \u201cthe exploding effects keep accumulating. About midway, I began to feel that the film was expanding in my head like a soft bullet.\u201d I\u2019ll just say I\u2019ve never seen anything like this in Tamil cinema, with its mix of the sacred and the profane, the epic and the intimate, the earthly and the otherworldly, the pop-cultural and the philosophical. It\u2019s a film you want to view as much with a microscope (zooming in on the details) as a telescope (zooming out to the bigger picture).\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.filmcompanion.in/super-deluxe-movie-review-baradwaj-rangan-mysskin-vijay-sethupathi-thiagarajan-kumararaja-unique-ambitious-insanely-detailed-blessedly-amoral-drama-thats-as-epic-as-it-is-intimate/|title=Super Deluxe a lip-smacking combination of \"high\" and \"low\" art|date=29 March 2019}}</ref> In a later Film Companion segment he also mentioned that he had refrained from watching the film twice, in order to keep the movie \u201cperfect\u201d in his mind and not find flaws. \n\nSrivatsan S, reviewing for The Hindu wrote \"No other filmmaker has probably romanticized the Tamil cinema universe with pop culture references as much as Kumararaja. In one of the earliest stretch, a character says, \u201cDai rascal! Enna maranthutiya?\u201d For a moment, it felt as though Kumararaja was asking this question to us: it\u2019s been eight years since he made a film. If Super Deluxe is what you get from a filmmaker who was in exile, then you don't mind waiting a few years from now till he comes up with his next eccentric film.\". M Suganth, in his review of the film for Times of India wrote \"There is black comedy, double entendres, swear words, WTF moments, political and social commentary, romance, sentiment and even a musing on what it means to be life on Earth. There is ambition, genius, and also a beating heart.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/entertainment/movies/super-deluxe-review-believe-the-hype/article26671414.ece|title='Super Deluxe' review: an unusual film with an assortment of quirky characters|first=Srivatsan|last=S|date=29 March 2019|via=www.thehindu.com|newspaper=The Hindu}}</ref>\n\n== Home video ==\nThe film was made available for [[video on demand]] on [[YouTube]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Deluxe|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FP-DZDqtEp4|website=Youtube}}</ref>\nThe film was made available for streaming on [[Netflix]] as well.<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Deluxe|url=https://www.netflix.com/in/title/81128584?source=35|accessdate=7 January 2020|website=Netflix}}</ref>\n\n== Awards and nominations ==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

One subplot involves a married couple Vaembu and Mugil, and a cop named Berlin; another plot involves Shilpa (previously Manickam), her wife Jyothi, their son Rasukutty, and Berlin the cop; the third plot involves Leela, her husband Dhanasekaran alias Arputham and their son Soori, and Mohan; and the last plot involves five friends: Balaji (Gaaji), Soori, Mohan, Vasanth (Mutta Puffs) and Thuyavan. \n\nVaembu and Mugil's plot starts at their home with the death of Vaembu's ex-boyfriend during sexual intercourse with Vaembu, while her husband Mugil was away. Mugil returns home, and is requested by the neighbors to accommodate some guests. During this ordeal Mugil finds out about the dead body, Vaembu confesses the affair and the eventual death of the ex-boyfriend, and tells her husband she will surrender to the police and accept her punishment. Mugil rejects Vaembu's suggestion, saying it would ruin him and his family's image. With the uninvited guests at home, they struggle to contain the situation. They talk about how they are both dissatisfied with their marriage. Eventually, they manage to get the corpse out of town but they are still caught by Berlin, a corrupted senior police officer. Berlin blackmails the couple for sexual favor from Vaembu, in exchange to contain the situation and get rid of the corpse. Mugil, in a confused state, tells Vaembu the consequences if they refuse, and urges her to accept the deal. Shattered, Vaembu still refuses, but realizes there are no options left them. Berlin continues to take advantage of the situation and demands his end of the deal there and then. Threatening with his gun, Berlin then instructs Vaembu to handcuff her husband to the car, and tells her to lie down. As he  advances towards Vaembu, intending to rape her, a TV hits him on his head, he collapses and dies. The couple dispose both the dead bodies. Mugil forgives Vaembu and they reconcile. \n\nShilpa's plot starts with a family eagerly expecting the return of Jyothi's husband Manickam, who absconded the family seven years ago. To their shock, Manickam arrives back from Mumbai as a trans woman named Shilpa. The family reacts in various ways to her transition. Shilpa and Jyothi's 7-year old son, Rasukutty, who has been desperately longing the return of his father wants to take Shilpa to school. Rasukutty wants to introduce Shilpha to his friends, and prove them wrong about their mockery of him for being a test-tube baby. Raskutty and Shilpa set off to the school, but on the way there Raskutty needs the toilet. While in the toilet a cop becomes suspicious of Shilpa and drags her and Rasukutty to the police station. Berlin, the same corrupt senior police officer at the station, intervenes and orally rapes Shilpa. He eventually lets Shilpa and Rasukutty go and they arrive at the school. Shilpa once more faces humiliation at the entrance of the school by the school watchmen and is refused entry. Rasukutty enters the school by himself, telling Shilpa to wait as he goes to get his friends. The school watchmen, a father of another student and a few other students continue to harass and humiliate Shilpa. Distressed and ashamed Shilpa buys tickets to return to Mumbai. On the way home from school Shilpa loses Rasukutty. Shocked and distressed Shilpa starts to search for Rasukutty desperately, again encountering Berlin in the process, but this time, they enter into a tussle when he finds out that Shilpa is bald. Shilpa curses Berlin in the style of a trans woman (their curse is feared by many to turn out true) to die. Eventually, she finds him at home. Rasukutty reveals he knows about Shilpa's intention of abandoning them again, and confronts her emotionally. Shilpa realises that Rasukutty and Jyothi accept her as she is, she cancels her plan and decides to stay with her family. \n\nThe boys' plot starts with all boys skipping school and gathering to watch pornographic film at Thuyavan's home. As soon as the porn film starts, Soori is left in shock and anger upon seeing his mother Leela in the movie. He breaks the TV in anger and runs away crying, Mohan follows to console him. Thuyavan, afraid of his father finding out about the broken TV, asks help of remaining two friends, Balaji and Vasanth, to find money to buy a new TV to replace the broken one. They accept a job from the local don, but fail miserably. On failing to cut the deal with the don, they are left with an additional burden of more lump sum requirement before EOD. They decide to steal money from a Seth. They initially sneak into his home and escape out with few currency notes. But later they find that those are old demonetized currency and plans to steal from Seth again. When they enter Seth's home again, they are confronted by a teenage girl (Mirnalini Ravi). She appears to have magical powers and strips down to reveal she is an alien. She reveals that the Seth who was lying on the sofa was her companion and has just died, and so she needs a new companion now. She takes interest in Balaji, one of the boys and clones him. One clone stays with her and the other joins his friends. The friends get the money from her and then they buy a new TV and throw away the old one which co-incidentally is the TV which hits Berlin on his head and results in his death (a result of Shilpa's curse).\n\nLeela's plot starts with Soori, who is angrily running towards her with a screwdriver upon finding out she was in a porn film.  As he is climbing the stairs to reach Leela, he trips and he stabs himself in the abdomen. He is taken to the hospital, and his father Arputham is informed about this accident. Arputham is a lone survivor from a tsunami who believes that he was saved by God in the form of a statue which he held onto when the tsunami struck. He devotes himself to this god and strongly believes that this god can cure all illness, however on this particular day he is reluctant to give service to the followers. Learning about Soori's condition, he rushes to the hospital and brings the wounded Soori back to his chapel, believing that his prayers would cure him. Then, Leela forcefully takes back Soori to the hospital and struggles to arrange medical expenses. It is revealed that Arputham, who struggles to find money, has begun to question his faith in God after a conversation with Shilpa the day before. During this conversation, Shilpa confesses she feels deep shame and guilt for snatching and delivering children to criminals that injure children and force then to beg on the streets to get money. Arputham states that her confession is the worst that he has ever heard, and there is no forgiveness for her. Shilpa decides to return home to search for her son, but before leaving tells Arputham that she too survived the tsunami by holding onto a rock too. Remembering back to this Arputham, in the present time, begins to doubt himself. He continues to pray for his son, but eventually ends up accidentally breaking the statue and finds diamonds in it. It is revealed that the diamonds are from a sunken Italian pirate ship. He uses the diamonds and saves Soori, but continues to think about his beliefs and religion.\n\nJust before the end credits, the three friends who were in pursuit of buying a new TV go to watch a porn movie at the theater. The movie starts with a doctor speaking about the existence of life and then a sequence of scenes follows where various characters explain the origin of life, the design pattern and similarity of universe, solar system and atomic structure of atoms. And finally the movie ends with the opening title of the porn movie which is \"Vaazhvin Ragasiyam\" (The Secret of Life).\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Vijay Sethupathi]] as Shilpa (Manickam), a transgender woman who returns home to her wife and son after transitioning\n* [[Fahadh Faasil]] as Mugil, Vaembu\u2019s husband who is devastated after he is cheated on but helps her to hide the body of her dead ex-boyfriend\n* [[Samantha Akkineni|Samantha]] as Vaembu, Mugil\u2019s wife who engages in scandalous intercourse with her ex-boyfriend, who suddenly dies in bed with her\n* [[Ramya Krishnan]] as Leela, a pornographic actress whose son accidentally injures himself after he finds out his mother\u2019s profession and attempts to injure her\n* [[Gayathrie]] as Jyothi, Shilpa\u2019s wife, who is devastated to find out that her husband is transgender\n* [[Mysskin]] as Arputham (Dhanasekaran), Leela\u2019s husband and a syncretic preacher who relies on religious healing to save his injured son\n* [[Bagavathi Perumal]] as Berlin, a corrupt sub-inspector who expresses lust for Shilpa and later Vaembu (main antagonist)\n* Ramana as Ramasamy\n* Vijay Ram as Balaji (Gaaji)\n* [[Mirnalini Ravi]] as Seth Girl (Alien)\n* Naveen as Soori\n* Jayanth as Mohan\n* Abdul Jabbar as Thuyavan\n* Noble K.

M Suganth, in his review of the film for Times of India wrote \"There is black comedy, double entendres, swear words, WTF moments, political and social commentary, romance, sentiment and even a musing on what it means to be life on Earth.

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo. The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the [[Lion's Mound]], a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved.\n\n==Prelude==\n{{Main|Waterloo Campaign}}\n[[File:Strategic Situation of Western Europe 1815.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.4|The strategic situation in Western Europe in 1815: 250,000 Frenchmen faced a coalition of about 850,000 soldiers on four [[Front (military)|fronts]].

Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]]. In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=136\u2013160}}\n\nBy June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men. The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another). Crossing the frontier near [[Charleroi]] before dawn on 15 June, the French [[Waterloo Campaign: Start of hostilities (15 June)|rapidly overran Coalition outposts]], securing Napoleon's \"central position\" between Wellington's and Bl\u00fccher's armies.

In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125023608/http://waterloobattletours.users.btopenworld.com/page14.html |title= The Battle of Quatre Bras (June 16th 1815)    |publisher= Archive Org | date=  | author=   | accessdate= April 17, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Simner\"/><ref name=\"Perr2013\">{{cite book|author=Bryan Perrett|title=Why the Germans Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Black Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8o7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78159-197-0|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army.

With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime. The historian [[Alessandro Barbero]] states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=19}}\n\nWellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments. The [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the [[Henry Paget, 1st Marquess of Anglesey|Earl of Uxbridge]]. Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general.

He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille.

He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont,{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=305, 306}} and later stated that \"the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=57}}\n\n===The Grand Battery starts its bombardment===\n[[File:Battle of Waterloo.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the battle: Napoleon's units are in blue, Wellington's in red, Bl\u00fccher's in grey.]]\n\nThe 80 guns of Napoleon's ''grande batterie'' drew up in the centre.

This was done because, being on the left of the four divisions, it was ordered to send one (Quiot's brigade) against the south and west of La Haye Sainte, while the other ([[Baron Charles-Francois Bourgeois|Bourgeois]]') was to attack the eastern side of the same post.{{sfn|Haweis|1908|p=228}}\n\nThe divisions were to advance in [[echelon (formation)|echelon]] from the left at a distance of 400 paces apart\u2014the 2nd Division ([[Fran\u00e7ois-Xavier Donzelot|Donzelot]]'s) on the right of Bourgeois' brigade, the 3rd Division ([[Pierre-Louis Binet de Marcognet|Marcognet]]'s) next, and the 4th Division ([[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Durutte|Durutte]]'s) on the right.

The farmhouse was defended by the [[King's German Legion]]. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of [[cuirassiers]], succeeded in isolating the farmhouse. The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope. The rest of the brigade was lying down just behind the road.{{efn|Website of current Dutch historian<!--s: Erwin van Muilwijk: [http://home.tiscali.nl/erwinmuilwijk/index.htm Tiscali.nl], and... website no longer contains the referenced sources--> Marco Bijl: [http://www.8militia.net/ 8militia.net];{{Harvnb|Eenens|1879|pp=14\u201330, 131\u2013198}}; De Jongh, W.A.: Veldtocht van den Jare 1815, Historisch verhaal; in De Nieuwe Militaire Spectator (Nijmegen 1866), pp. 13\u201327.(This is the original account of Colonel de Jongh, commander of the Dutch 8th Militia.

Van Zuylen rallied 400 men, according to his estimate, who were ready to join the counterattack and even captured two French fanions ({{Harvnb|Bas|Wommersom|1909|pp=338\u2013341}}(vol. 3); {{Harvnb|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=293\u2013295}}).}} A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right.

Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle\u2014a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than {{convert|60|ft}} in length on a side. Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares. Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry. Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|pp=444, 447}}{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=273, 414}}\n\nWitnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12&nbsp;assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer. Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite ''carabinier'' brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|p=359}}\n\nA British eyewitness of the first French cavalry attack, an officer in the Foot Guards, recorded his impressions very lucidly and somewhat poetically:\n\n{{quote|About four p.m., the enemy's artillery in front of us ceased firing all of a sudden, and we saw large masses of cavalry advance: not a man present who survived could have forgotten in after life the awful grandeur of that charge.

On they came until they got near enough, whilst the very earth seemed to vibrate beneath the thundering tramp of the mounted host. One might suppose that nothing could have resisted the shock of this terrible moving mass. They were the famous cuirassiers, almost all old soldiers, who had distinguished themselves on most of the battlefields of Europe. In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

General M\u00fcffling, the Prussian liaison to Wellington, rode to meet Zieten.\n\nZieten had by this time brought up the [[Order of battle of the Waterloo campaign#Prussian 1st Brigade|Prussian 1st Brigade]] ([[Karl Friedrich Franciscus von Steinmetz|Steinmetz]]'s), but had become concerned at the sight of stragglers and casualties from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from the Prussian 15th Brigade (Laurens'). These troops appeared to be withdrawing and Zieten, fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting to move away from Wellington's flank and towards the Prussian main body near Plancenoit. Zieten had also received a direct order from Bl\u00fccher to support B\u00fclow, which Zieten obeyed, starting to march to B\u00fclow's aid.\n\nM\u00fcffling saw this movement away and persuaded Zieten to support Wellington's left flank.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|1999|p=125}} M\u00fcffling warned Zieten that \"The battle is lost if the corps does not keep on the move and immediately support the English army.\"{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=232}} Zieten resumed his march to support Wellington directly, and the arrival of his troops allowed Wellington to reinforce his crumbling centre by moving cavalry from his left.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|1999|p=125}}\n\nThe French were expecting Grouchy to march to their support from Wavre, and when Prussian I Corps (Zieten's) appeared at Waterloo instead of Grouchy, \"the shock of disillusionment shattered French morale\" and \"the sight of Zieten's arrival caused turmoil to rage in Napoleon's army\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=233}} I Corps proceeded to attack the French troops before Papelotte and by 19:30 the French position was bent into a rough horseshoe shape.

This attack, mounted at around 19:30, was intended to break through Wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the Prussians.

The Middle Guard formed in battalion squares, each about 550 men strong, with the 1st/3rd Grenadiers, led by Generals [[Louis Friant|Friant]] and [[Paul-Jean-Baptiste Poret de Morvan|Poret de Morvan]], on the right along the road, to their left and rear was General Harlet leading the square of the 4th Grenadiers, then the 1st/3rd Chasseurs under General [[Claude-\u00c9tienne Michel|Michel]], next the 2nd/3rd Chasseurs and finally the large single square of two battalions of 800 soldiers of the 4th Chasseurs led by General Henrion. Two batteries of Imperial Guard Horse Artillery accompanied them with sections of two guns between the squares. Each square was led by a general and Marshal Ney, mounted on his 5th horse of the day, led the advance.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=191\u2013192}} Behind them, in reserve, were the three battalions of the Old Guard, right to left 1st/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/2nd Chasseurs and 1st/2nd Chasseurs. Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault; however, Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Anglo-allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre. Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabb\u00e9 to order Ney to adjust, but Crabb\u00e9 was unable to get there in time.\n\nOther troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard. On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced. On the right all the now rallied elements of D'\u00c9rlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the Anglo-allied line. Of these, P\u00e9got's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers. The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire. Next, Colin Halket's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob. Other Anglo-allied troops began to give way as well. A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the Anglo-allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded. General Harlet brought up the 4th Grenadiers and the Anglo-allied centre was now in serious danger of breaking.\n\n[[File:General D H Chass\u00e9.jpg|thumb|upright|General D H Chass\u00e9|General [[David Hendrik Chass\u00e9]]]]\n\nIt was at this critical moment that the Dutch General [[David Hendrik Chass\u00e9|Chass\u00e9]] engaged the advancing French forces.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=196\u2013199}} Chass\u00e9's relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by a battery of Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain [[Carel Frederik Krahmer de Bichin|Krahmer de Bichin]].

But as their advance mounted the ridge they found it apparently abandoned and covered with dead. Suddenly 1,500 British Foot Guards under [[Peregrine Maitland|Maitland]] who had been lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys. The chasseurs deployed to answer the fire, but some 300 fell from the first volley, including Colonel Mallet and General Michel, and both battalion commanders.{{sfn|Field|2013|p=200}} A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke the leaderless squares, which fell back onto the following column. The 4th Chasseurs battalion, 800 strong, now came up onto the exposed battalions of British Foot Guards, who lost all cohesion and dashed back up the slope as a disorganized crowd with the chasseurs in pursuit. At the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the 1st and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs. They opened fire and swept away the gunners. The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back. But the skirmishers were replaced by the [[52nd (Oxfordshire) Regiment of Foot|52nd Light Infantry]], led by [[John Colborne]], which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them. The chasseurs returned a very sharp fire which killed or wounded some 150 men of the 52nd.{{sfn|Field|2013|pp=203}} The 52nd then charged,{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=214\u2013215}}{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=70}} and under this onslaught, the chasseurs broke.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=70}}\n\nThe last of the Guard retreated headlong.

No further major conflict occurred until the [[Crimean War]] of 1853\u20131856. Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned after Waterloo, included the formation of the [[Holy Alliance]] of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former [[Holy Roman Empire]] into a [[German Confederation]] increasingly marked by the political dominance of [[Prussia]]. The bicentenary of Waterloo prompted renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and to the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed.<ref>{{harvnb|Rapport|2015}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Black|2015}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Keeling|2015}}</ref>{{efn|Napoleon's last escapade was important politically because it \"compelled all the powers at Vienna to bury their remaining differences in order to achieve a peace which would enshrine the principles of the balance of power\".{{Harv|Kennedy|1987|p= 37}} \"No international disturbance comparable in magnitude...has ever been followed by such a protracted period of peace\". {{Harv|Palmer|1956|p=420}} Recovering, after Waterloo, from six decades of abnormal obstacles to transatlantic commerce (from the Seven Years War onwards), increasingly industrialized Europe and North America, by 1914, accounted for over 90% of global coal, iron and steel production and 76% of international trade.{{Harv|Paxton|1985|p= 2}} }}\n\n===Views on the reasons for Napoleon's defeat===\nGeneral [[Antoine-Henri Jomini|Antoine-Henri]], Baron Jomini, one of the leading military writers on the Napoleonic art of war, had a number of very cogent explanations of the reasons behind Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo.{{efn|Jomini was Swiss, but was an officer, eventually a general, in the French army and had served on the staff of Marshal Ney.

He also seems to have discounted the presence of B\u00fclow's substantial corps, which had not been in action at Ligny. Had Napoleon retained Grouchy's 30,000 men as a guard for his right flank, it is likely that these troops could have held off the Prussians and allowed the rest of Napoleon's army to attack Wellington's army unmolested.}} the second, was the admirable firmness of the British infantry, joined to the sang-froid and aplomb of its chiefs; the third, was the horrible weather, that had softened the ground, and rendered the offensive movements so toilsome, and retarded till one o'clock the attack that should have been made in the morning; the fourth, was the inconceivable formation of the first corps, in masses very much too deep for the first grand attack.|Antoine-Henri Jomini.{{sfn|Jomini|1864|pp=223, 224}} }}\n\nThe Prussian soldier, historian, and theorist [[Carl von Clausewitz]], who as a young colonel had served as chief-of-staff to Thielmann's Prussian III Corps during the Waterloo campaign, expressed the following opinion:\n\n{{quote|\nBonaparte and the authors who support him have always attempted to portray the great catastrophes that befell him as the result of chance.

The operation of General B\u00fclow upon the enemy's flank was a most decisive one; and, even if I had not found myself in a situation to make the attack which produced the final result, it would have forced the enemy to retire if his attacks should have failed, and would have prevented him from taking advantage of them if they should unfortunately have succeeded\".<ref name=\"Gazette, 17028\"/>}}\nDespite their differences on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's study of the ''Campaign of 1815'' and ''Wellington's famous 1842 essay'' in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|loc=''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/five1-9.htm Campaign of 1815]'' and ''[http://www.clausewitz.com/readings/1815/six.htm Wellington's famous 1842 essay]''}} Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington.{{sfn|Clausewitz|Wellington|2010|pp=144\u2013145 (Chapter 41 of Clausewitz's ''Feldzug'')}}\n\nAn alternative view is that towards the end of the battle Wellington's Anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without Prussian help. For example, Parkinson (2000) writes: \"Neither army beat Napoleon alone. But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. ....

Wellington, when he beheld Waterloo once more, two years later, exclaimed, \"They have altered my field of battle!\" Where the great pyramid of earth, surmounted by the lion, rises to-day, there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the Nivelles road, but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to Genappe.

A French army under the command of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] was defeated by two of the armies of the [[Seventh Coalition]]: an army consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Duke of Wellington]], referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] army under the command of Field Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher|von Bl\u00fccher]] referred also as Bl\u00fccher's army. The battle marked the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]].\n\nUpon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies. Wellington and Bl\u00fccher's armies were [[canton (military)|cantoned]] close to the northeastern border of France. Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition. On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the [[Battle of Ligny]] with his main force, causing the Prussians to [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|withdraw northwards on the 17th]], parallel to Wellington and in good order. Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate [[Battle of Wavre]] with the Prussian rear-guard on 18\u201319 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo. Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the [[Battle of Quatre Bras]] with the Anglo-allied army. The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to [[Waterloo campaign: Quatre Bras to Waterloo|withdraw north to Waterloo on the 17th.]]\n \nUpon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Mont-Saint-Jean]] escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo. Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of the 18th, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties. In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the [[French Imperial Guard]]. With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army withstood and repulsed the [[French Imperial Guard]], and the French army was routed.\n\nWaterloo was the decisive engagement of the [[Waterloo Campaign]] and Napoleon's last. According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\".<ref>[[q:Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington|Wikiquote:Wellington]] citing ''Creevey Papers'', ch. x, p. 236</ref> [[Abdication of Napoleon, 1815|Napoleon abdicated]] four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July. The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as [[Emperor of the French]] and marked the end of his [[Hundred Days]] return from exile. This ended the [[First French Empire]] and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of [[International relations of the Great Powers (1814\u20131919)|relative peace]], often referred to as the ''[[Pax Britannica]]''.\n\nThe battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of [[Braine-l'Alleud]] and [[Lasne]],{{sfn|Marcelis|2015}} about {{convert|15|km|mi}} south of [[Brussels]], and about {{convert|2|km|mi}} from the town of Waterloo.

Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the [[Peninsular War]] had been sent to North America to fight in the [[War of 1812]].{{sfn|Chandler|1966|pp=1016, 1017, 1093}}\n\nThe initial dispositions of British commander [[Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington]], were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through [[Mons]] to the south-west of Brussels.{{sfn|Siborne<!--W-->|1895|p=82}} This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by [[Gebhard Leberecht von Bl\u00fccher]], but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at [[Ostend]].

The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers.{{sfn|Herold|1967|pp= 53, 58, 110}} Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by [[Michel Ney|Marshal Ney]], a right wing commanded by [[Emmanuel, marquis de Grouchy|Marshal Grouchy]] and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another).

In the early hours of 16 June, at the [[Duchess of Richmond's ball]] in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance. He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on [[Quatre Bras]], where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of [[Bernhard Carl of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar]], was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing.{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=508}}\n\nNey's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary. Ney found the crossroads of [[Battle of Quatre Bras|Quatre Bras]] lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops. First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived. He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061125023608/http://waterloobattletours.users.btopenworld.com/page14.html |title= The Battle of Quatre Bras (June 16th 1815)    |publisher= Archive Org | date=  | author=   | accessdate= April 17, 2020  }}</ref><ref name=\"Simner\"/><ref name=\"Perr2013\">{{cite book|author=Bryan Perrett|title=Why the Germans Lost: The Rise and Fall of the Black Eagle|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b8o7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA51|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Pen and Sword|isbn=978-1-78159-197-0|pages=51\u2013}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Bl\u00fccher's Prussians at the [[Battle of Ligny]] using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army. The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground. [[Waterloo Campaign: Ligny through Wavre to Waterloo|The Prussian retreat from Ligny]] went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French.

Instead, they, too, fell back northwards\u2014parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout. The Prussians rallied on [[Friedrich Wilhelm Freiherr von B\u00fclow|B\u00fclow]]'s IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of [[Wavre]].{{sfn|Chesney|1874|pp=144\u2013145}}\n\nWith the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable.

Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had [[Blank cheque|carte blanche]] from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion. Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} away to the west. They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother [[Prince Frederick of the Netherlands]]. They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=239\u2013240}}{{efn|The straight-line distance from Halle to Braine-l'Alleud, Wellington's far right flank is nearly the same as the straight-line distance from Wavre to [[Frichermont]], Wellington's far left flank, around {{convert|8|mi|km}}.}}\n\nThe Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation. In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and ''Freikorps'' volunteer formations from the wars of 1813\u20131814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many ''[[Landwehr]]'' (militia) regiments. The ''Landwehr'' were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium. The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|p=59}} Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance\u2014guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nOffsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its [[German General Staff|General Staff]] organisation. These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training. This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army. This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}}\n\nAfter Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours.{{sfn|Hofschr\u00f6er|2005|pp=60\u201362}} Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under B\u00fclow, commander of IV Corps, attacked [[Georges Mouton|Lobau]] at 16:30, while [[Hans Ernst Karl, Graf von Zieten|Zieten]]'s I Corps and parts of [[Pirch I]]'s II Corps engaged at about 18:00.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Prussian March |url=https://www.waterlooassociation.org.uk/2018/06/04/prussian-advance/ |website=Waterloo Association |accessdate=9 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Battlefield==\n{{further|List of Waterloo Battlefield locations}}\n[[File:Waterloo.1816.02.jpg|thumb|left|An 1816 map of the local topography and the location of the battle]]\n[[File:Belgium-6773 - Battlefield View (14152126362).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A view of the battlefield from the Lion's mound. On the top right are the buildings of [[La Haye Sainte]].]]\n\nThe Waterloo position was a strong one. It consisted of a long ridge running east\u2013west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels. Along the crest of the ridge ran the [[Ohain, Belgium|Ohain]] road, a deep [[sunken lane]]. Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was [[Waterloo Elm|a large elm tree]] that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day. Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}}\n\nUsing the [[Reverse slope defence|reverse slope]], as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his [[skirmisher]]s and artillery.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=78\u201379}} The length of front of the battlefield was also relatively short at {{convert|2.5|mi|0}}. This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of [[Braine-l'Alleud]], in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=80}}\n\nIn front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified. On the extreme right were the ch\u00e2teau, garden, and orchard of [[Hougoumont (farmhouse)|Hougoumont]]. This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees. The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied. On the extreme left was the hamlet of [[Papelotte]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}}\n\nBoth Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's [[Flanking maneuver|flanks]] securely. Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position. On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of [[La Haye Sainte]], which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=149}} On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the [[95th Rifles]] were posted as sharpshooters.{{sfn|Parry|1900|p=58}}\n\nWellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force. Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position. Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between [[Enfilade and defilade|enfilading fire]] from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte. On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the [[List of Waterloo Battlefield locations#Eastern end of the line of battle|other garrisoned buildings]] on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain [[defile (geography)|defile]].{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=141, 235}}\n\nThe French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south. Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road. On the right was I Corps under [[Jean-Baptiste Drouet, Comte d'Erlon|d'Erlon]] with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700. On the left was II Corps under [[Honor\u00e9 Charles Reille|Reille]] with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600. In the centre about the road south of the inn ''[[La Belle Alliance]]'' were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the [[Imperial Guard (Napoleon I)|Imperial Guard]], and a cavalry reserve of 2,000.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=83\u201385}}\n\nIn the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of [[Plancenoit]], and at the extreme right, the ''Bois de Paris'' wood. Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near ''La Belle Alliance'' early in the afternoon. Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=91}}\n{{wide image|Panorama waterloo v2.jpg|1100px|align-cap=center|Panorama of the Waterloo battlefield, (2012)}}\n\n==Battle==\n===Preparation===\n[[File:Waterloo Campaign map-alt3.svg|thumb|upright=1.4|Map of the Waterloo campaign]]\n\nWellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn. He had earlier written to Bl\u00fccher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Bl\u00fccher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels. At a late-night council, Bl\u00fccher's chief of staff, [[August Neidhardt von Gneisenau]], had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Bl\u00fccher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army. In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Bl\u00fccher, promising to support him with three corps.{{sfn|Longford|1971|pp=535\u2013536}}\n\nFrom 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces. At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under B\u00fclow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny. Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny. They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow. The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and B\u00fclow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88&nbsp;artillery pieces. Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along B\u00fclow's intended route. As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo. B\u00fclow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=141}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\">{{cite book|author=John Grehan|title=Voices from the Past: Waterloo 1815: History's most famous battle told through eyewitness accounts, newspaper reports, parliamentary debate, memoirs and diaries.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_0KuCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA342|date=30 May 2015|publisher=Frontline Books|isbn=978-1-78383-199-9|pages=105\u2013}}</ref>\n\nNapoleon breakfasted off silver plate at ''Le Caillou'', the house where he had spent the night. When [[Jean-de-Dieu Soult|Soult]] suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general. I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=547}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nNapoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\". He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|pp=163\u2013166}}\n\n[[File:Napoleon.Waterloo.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|[[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium|Battle of Mont-Saint-Jean]]]]\n\nLater on, being told by his brother, [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Bonaparte|Jerome]], of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|p=73}} Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at ''Le Caillou'' had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Bl\u00fccher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.{{sfn|Roberts|2001|p=xxxii}}\n\nNapoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult. In addition, many of his forces had [[bivouac shelter|bivouacked]] well to the south of ''La Belle Alliance''. At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\".{{sfn|Longford|1971|p=548}}<ref name=\"Gre2015\"/>\n\nAt 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another. This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge.{{sfn|Bonaparte|1869|pp=292\u2013293}} To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves,{{sfn|Fletcher|1994|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=US-QQxjHnn8C&pg=PA20 20]}} since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea. A ''[[Grand Battery|grande batterie]]'' of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00. D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west. In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea.{{sfn|Barbero|2005|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Hougoumont===\n{{Main|Hougoumont}}\n[[File:Nassau - Hougoumont - Papendrecht.jpg|thumb|Nassau troops at the Hougoumont farm]]\n[[File:800px-North gate Hougoumont.jpg|thumb|Gate on the north side assaulted by the ''1st L\u00e9g\u00e8re'' who were led by ''[[sous-lieutenant]]'' Legros{{sfn|Lamar|2000|p=119}}]]\n\nThe historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\".{{sfn|Roberts|2005|p=55}} Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\".{{sfn|Wellesley|1815|loc=''To Earl Bathurst.

The Duke of Wellington puts it at 10:00. General Alava says half-past eleven, Napoleon and Drouet say noon, and Ney 13:00. Lord Hill may be credited with having settled this minute question of fact. He took two watches with him into the fight, one a stop-watch, and he marked with it the sound of the first shot fired, and this evidence is now accepted as proving that the first flash of red flame which marked the opening of the world-shaking tragedy of Waterloo took place at exactly ten minutes to twelve\" {{Harv|Fitchett|2006|loc=Chapter: King-making Waterloo}}. \"...watches had to be set by solar time, this meant that it was rare for two watches to agree... For example, on 9 June, ... the French I Corps had been at Lille, while the IV Corps was at Metz. Assuming an officer had set his watch at noon and then meticulously wound it twice a day but not reset it during the approach march, by the time the two corps reached the vicinity of Waterloo, the I Corps officer's watch would have read 12:40 p.m. at a time when the IV Corps officer's read 11:20 a.m., and it was noon at Waterloo. This is an extreme example, and unlikely to have actually been the case, but it demonstrates the problem quite well\" {{harv|Nofi|1998|p=182}}.}} The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of [[Foot guards|Guards]], and the wood and park by Hanoverian ''[[J\u00e4ger (military)|J\u00e4ger]]'' and the 1/2nd Nassau.{{efn|That is, the 1st battalion of the 2nd Regiment.

As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house. Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard.{{sfn|Thiers|1862|p=215}} The [[Coldstream Guards]] and the [[Scots Guards]] arrived to support the defence. There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in. The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed. Only a young drummer boy was spared.\n\nFighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon. Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont. Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it. In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire,{{efn|Seeing the flames, Wellington sent a note to the house's commander stating that he must hold his position whatever the cost {{Harv|Barbero|2005|p=298}}.}} resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel. Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers. Eventually they were relieved by the [[71st (Highland) Regiment of Foot|71st Highlanders]], a British infantry regiment. Adam's brigade was further reinforced by [[Hugh Halkett]]'s 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille. Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle.\n\n{{quote|I had occupied that post with a detachment from General Byng's brigade of Guards, which was in position in its rear; and it was some time under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel MacDonald, and afterwards of Colonel Home; and I am happy to add that it was maintained, throughout the day, with the utmost gallantry by these brave troops, notwithstanding the repeated efforts of large bodies of the enemy to obtain possession of it.|Wellington.{{sfn|Booth|1815|p=10}} }}\n\n{{quote|When I reached Lloyd's abandoned guns, I stood near them for about a minute to contemplate the scene: it was grand beyond description.

Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21&nbsp;battalions (12,000&nbsp;troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings.

The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse. Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The [[William II of the Netherlands|Prince of Orange]] saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian L\u00fcneburg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=289\u2013293}}\n\nAt about 13:30, d'Erlon started to advance his three other divisions, some 14,000&nbsp;men over a front of about {{convert|1,000|m|yd|abbr=off}}, against Wellington's left wing. At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000&nbsp;men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"[[Brigade van Bylandt]]\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side. The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under [[Sir Thomas Picton]], who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge. All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras. In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope.

It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with [[Willem Frederik van Bylandt|Bylandt]]'s brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right. Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division. In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade. On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the ''45e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'' and followed by the ''25e R\u00e9giment de Ligne'', somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the ''21e'' and ''45e'' regiments. Opposing them on the other side of the road was [[Denis Pack|Pack]]'s 9th Brigade consisting of the [[44th Foot]] and three Scottish regiments: the [[Royal Scots]], the 42nd [[Black Watch]], and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men. A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|pp=134\u2013138}}\n\nThe French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road. As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire. However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation. Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble. Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers.{{sfn|Hamilton-Williams|1993|pp=296\u2013297}} Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging. The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French ''45e Ligne'' burst through the hedge cheering. Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo.{{sfn|Barbero|2006|p=138}}\n\nReports from [[Karl Freiherr von M\u00fcffling|Baron von M\u00fcffling]], the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\".{{sfn|Uffindell|Corum|2002|p=211}}\n\n===Charge of the British heavy cavalry===\n{{quote|Our officers of cavalry have acquired a trick of galloping at everything.

In an almost incredibly short period they were within twenty yards of us, shouting ''\"Vive l'Empereur!\"'' The word of command, \"Prepare to receive cavalry\", had been given, every man in the front ranks knelt, and a wall bristling with steel, held together by steady hands, presented itself to the infuriated cuirassiers.|Captain Rees Howell Gronow, Foot Guards.{{sfn|Gronow|1862|loc=''The Duke of Wellington in our square''}} }}\n\n[[File:Artillery in Battle of Waterloo by Jones.jpg|thumb|\"The artillery officers had the range so accurately, that every shot and shell fell into the very centre of their masses\" (Original inscription and drawing after [[George Jones (painter)|George Jones]])]]\n\nIn essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect.{{sfn|Weller|1992|pp=211, 212}} Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive. The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive.{{sfn|Adkin|2001|pp=252, 361}} Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge. If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them. The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry. At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges. [[Cavali\u00e9 Mercer|Captain Mercer]], who commanded [[G Parachute Battery (Mercer's Troop) Royal Horse Artillery|'G' Troop]], [[Royal Horse Artillery]], thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect.{{sfn|Mercer|1870a|pp=313\u2013315}}{{efn|This qualification may have been self-serving on Mercer's part.

The whole of that plain is a sepulchre for France.|[[Victor Hugo]], ''[[Les Mis\u00e9rables]]''.{{sfn|Hugo|1862|loc=Chapter VII: Napoleon in a Good Humor}} }}\n\nThe alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/history/10218931/Rescuing-the-farm-where-Wellington-won-the-battle-of-Waterloo.html|title=Rescuing the farm where Wellington won the battle of Waterloo|last=Shute|first=Joe|date=2013-08-02|access-date=2018-01-17|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}</ref>\n\nOther terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle. These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels\u2013Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance.\n\nApart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield. A cluster of monuments at the Brussels\u2013Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud\u2013Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops. A monument to the French dead, entitled ''L'Aigle bless\u00e9'' (\"The Wounded Eagle\"), marks the location where it is believed one of the Imperial Guard units formed a square during the closing moments of the battle.{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}}\n\nA monument to the Prussian dead is located in the village of Plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The [[Guillaume Philibert Duhesme|Duhesme]] mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of [[Genappe]]. Seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the [[Brussels Cemetery#The British Waterloo Campaign Monument|British Monument]] in the [[Brussels Cemetery]] in [[Evere]].{{sfn|Hoorebeeke|2007|pp=6\u201321}} The remains of a 23-year-old soldier named Friederich Brandt were discovered in 2012.{{sfn|Paton|2015}} He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, {{convert|1.60|m}} tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His rifle, coins, and position on the battlefield identified him as an Hanoverian fighting in the King's German Legion.{{sfn|Peel|2012}}\n\n==Coin controversy==\nAs part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 [[Belgium]] minted a two-[[euro]] coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle. France officially protested against this issue of coins, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo.{{sfn|Torfs|2015}} After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted. Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2{{sfrac|1|2}} euros. Legally valid only within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 euros. A ten-euro coin, showing Wellington, Bl\u00fccher, their troops and the silhouette of Napoleon, was also available in silver for 42 euros.{{sfn|Kottasova|2015}}\n\n==Recent discovery at Mont St. Jean==\nOn 15 July 2019, archaeologists at [[Mont-Saint-Jean, Belgium]], found evidence of a shooting clash that happened there between attacking French cavalry and defending British infantry, including 58 [[musket ball]]s and 3 amputated human leg bones.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.itv.com/news/2019-07-17/human-remains-and-cannon-ball-unearthed-at-battle-of-waterloo-hospital-site/ |title=Human remains and cannon ball unearthed at Battle of Waterloo hospital site |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |work=[[ITV News]] |publisher=[[ITV plc]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2019/07/17/veterans-unearth-amputated-leg-bones-musket-balls-waterloo-field/ |title=Soldier archaeologists unearth musket balls and amputated leg bones at Battle of Waterloo field hospital site |first=James |last=Crisp |date=17 July 2019 |access-date=20 September 2019 |newspaper=[[Telegraph (newspaper)|Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group Limited]] |page=16}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|France|War}}\n* [[Lord Uxbridge's leg]] was shattered by a [[grape-shot]] at the Battle of Waterloo and removed by a surgeon.

With a curiosity about nature, he studied the heavens using a telescope from his father and observed the birds flying. Essentially a country boy, he loved the outdoors and hiking with his father on trips to Worcester and became an excellent marksman with a rifle.<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|63,64}} In 1898, his mother contracted tuberculosis and they moved back to Worcester for the clear air. On Sundays, the family attended the Episcopal church, and Robert sang in the choir.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|16}}\n\n===Childhood experiment===\nWith the [[electrification]] of American cities in the 1880s, the young Goddard became interested in science\u2014specifically, engineering and technology. When his father showed him how to generate static electricity on the family's carpet, the five-year-old's imagination was sparked.

He became a thorough diarist and documenter of his work\u2014a skill that would greatly benefit his later career. These interests merged at age 16, when Goddard attempted to construct a balloon out of [[aluminum]], shaping the raw metal in his home workshop, and filling it with hydrogen. After nearly five weeks of methodical, documented efforts, he finally abandoned the project, remarking, \"... balloon will not go up. ... Aluminum is too heavy. Failior {{sic}} crowns enterprise.\" However, the lesson of this failure did not restrain Goddard's growing determination and confidence in his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|21}} He wrote in 1927, \"I imagine an innate interest in mechanical things was inherited from a number of ancestors  who were machinists.\" <ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|7}}\n\n===Cherry tree dream===\nHe became interested in space when he read [[H.

The 17-year-old Goddard climbed a cherry tree to cut off dead limbs. He was transfixed by the sky, and his imagination grew. He later wrote:\n\n{{quote |On this day I climbed a tall cherry tree at the back of the barn ... and as I looked toward the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the ''possibility'' of ascending to Mars, and how it would look on a small scale, if sent up from the meadow at my feet. I have several photographs of the tree, taken since, with the little ladder I made to climb it, leaning against it.\nIt seemed to me then that a weight whirling around a horizontal shaft, moving more rapidly above than below, could furnish lift by virtue of the greater centrifugal force at the top of the path.\n\nI was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended. Existence at last seemed very purposive.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|26}}<ref name=\"NASA Goddard\" >{{cite web\n  | url = http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sgoddard.htm\n  | title = Robert Goddard and His Rockets\n  | publisher = NASA}}</ref>}}\n\nFor the rest of his life, he observed October 19 as \"Anniversary Day\", a private commemoration of the day of his greatest inspiration.\n\n== Education and early studies ==\n\nThe young Goddard was a thin and frail boy, almost always in fragile health. He suffered from stomach problems, pleurisy, colds, and bronchitis, and he fell two years behind his classmates. He became a voracious reader, regularly visiting the local public library to borrow books on the physical sciences.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|16,19}}\n\n===Aerodynamics and motion===\n\nGoddard's interest in aerodynamics led him to study some of [[Samuel Langley]]'s scientific papers in the periodical ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]''. In these papers, Langley wrote that birds flap their wings with different force on each side to turn in the air. Inspired by these articles, the teenage Goddard watched swallows and chimney swifts from the porch of his home, noting how subtly the birds moved their wings to control their flight. He noted how remarkably the birds controlled their flight with their tail feathers, which he called the birds' equivalent of [[ailerons]]. He took exception to some of Langley's conclusions and in 1901 wrote a letter to ''St. Nicholas'' magazine<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|5}} with his own ideas. The editor of  ''St. Nicholas'' declined to publish Goddard's letter, remarking that birds fly with a certain amount of intelligence and that \"machines will not act with such intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|31}} Goddard disagreed, believing that a man could control a flying machine with his own intelligence.\n\nAround this time, Goddard read [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', and found that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law of Motion]] applied to motion in space. He wrote later about his own tests of the Law:\n\n{{quote |I began to realize that there might be something after all to Newton's Laws. The Third Law was accordingly tested, both with devices suspended by rubber bands and by devices on floats, in the little brook back of the barn, and the said law was verified conclusively. It made me realize that if a way to navigate space were to be discovered, or invented, it would be the result of a knowledge of physics and mathematics.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}}}}\n\n===Academics===\nAs his health improved, Goddard continued his formal schooling as a 19-year-old sophomore at [[South High Community School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm|title=Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Collection \u2013 Archives and Special Collections \u2013 Clark University|work=clarku.edu}}</ref> in Worcester in 1901. He excelled in his coursework, and his peers twice elected him class president. Making up for  lost time, he studied books on mathematics, astronomy, mechanics and composition from the school library.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}} At his graduation ceremony in 1904, he gave his class oration as [[valedictorian]]. In his speech, entitled \"On Taking Things for Granted\", Goddard included a section that would become emblematic of his life:\n\n<blockquote>[J]ust as in the sciences we have learned that we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|19}}\n</blockquote>\n\nGoddard enrolled at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in 1904.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|41}} He quickly impressed the head of the physics department, A. Wilmer Duff, with his thirst for knowledge, and Duff took him on as a laboratory assistant and tutor.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|42}} At WPI, Goddard joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity and began a long courtship with high school classmate Miriam Olmstead, an honor student who had graduated with him as [[salutatorian]]. Eventually, she and Goddard were engaged, but they drifted apart and ended the engagement around 1909.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp |51}}\n\nGoddard received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in physics from Worcester Polytechnic in 1908,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} and after serving there for a year as an instructor in physics, he began his graduate studies at [[Clark University]] in Worcester in the fall of 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/library/collections/rgoddard.html | publisher =WPI George C. Gordon Library | title = Robert Goddard |date= |accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> Goddard received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in physics from Clark University in 1910, and then stayed at Clark to complete his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics in 1911. He spent another year at Clark as an honorary fellow in physics, and in 1912 he accepted a research fellowship at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Frist Campus Center|Palmer Physical Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|56\u201358}}\n\n===First scientific writings===\nThe high school student summed up his ideas on space travel in a proposed article, \"The Navigation of Space,\" which he submitted to the ''Popular Science News''. The journal's editor returned it, saying that they could not use it \"in the near future.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|34}}\n\nWhile still an undergraduate, Goddard wrote a paper proposing a method for balancing [[airplane]]s using gyro-stabilization. He submitted the idea to ''[[Scientific American]]'', which published the paper in 1907. Goddard later wrote in his diaries that he believed his paper was the first proposal of a way to automatically stabilize aircraft in flight.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} His proposal came around the same time as other scientists were making breakthroughs in developing functional [[gyroscope]]s.\n\nWhile studying physics at WPI, ideas came to Goddard's mind that sometimes seemed impossible, but he was compelled to record them for future investigation. He wrote that \"there was something inside which simply would not stop working.\" He purchased some cloth-covered notebooks and began filling them with a variety of thoughts, mostly concerning his dream of space travel.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|11\u201313}} He considered centrifugal force, radio waves, magnetic reaction, solar energy, atomic energy, ion or electrostatic propulsion and other methods to reach space. After experimenting with solid fuel rockets he was convinced by 1909 that chemical-propellant engines were the answer.<ref name= \"Frank\" />{{rp|11\u201312}} A particularly complex concept was set down in June 1908: Sending a camera around distant planets, guided by measurements of gravity along the trajectory, and returning to earth.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|14}}\n\nHis first writing on the possibility of a liquid-fueled rocket came on February 2, 1909. Goddard had begun to study ways of increasing a rocket's efficiency using methods differing from conventional [[solid-fuel rocket]]s. He wrote in his notebook about using liquid hydrogen as a fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. He believed that 50 percent efficiency could be achieved with these liquid propellants (i.e., half of the heat energy of combustion converted to the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|55}}\n\n==First patents==\nIn the decades around 1910, radio was a new technology, fertile for innovation. In 1912, while working at Princeton University, Goddard investigated the effects of radio waves on insulators.<ref>Goddard, Robert H. \"On ponderomotive force upon a dielectric which carries a displacement current in a magnetic field\", ''[[Physical Review]]'', Vol. 6(2), pp. 99\u2013120 (August 1914).</ref> In order to generate radio-frequency power, he invented a vacuum tube with a beam deflection<ref>{{US patent|1159209}}</ref> that operated like a cathode-ray oscillator tube. His patent on this tube, which predated that of [[Lee De Forest]], became central in the suit between [[Arthur A. Collins]], whose small company made radio transmitter tubes, and [[AT&T]] and [[RCA]] over his use of [[vacuum tube]] technology.  Goddard accepted only a consultant's fee from Collins when the suit was dropped. Eventually the two big companies allowed the country's growing electronics industry to use the De Forest patents freely.<ref>McElroy, Gil, \"The Collins 45A \u2013 How Art Collins met Robert Goddard\", ''QST'', Vol. 81(2), pp. 44\u201346 (February 1997).</ref>\n\n===Rocket math===\nBy 1912 he had in his spare time, using calculus, developed the mathematics which allowed him to calculate the position and velocity of a rocket in vertical flight, given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity (with respect to the rocket frame) of the exhaust gases. In effect he had independently developed the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] published a decade earlier in Russia. For vertical flight he included the effects of gravity and aerodynamic drag.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|136}}\n\nHis first goal was to build a [[Rocketsonde|sounding rocket]] with which to study the atmosphere. Not only would such investigation aid meteorology, but it was necessary to determine temperature, density and wind speed in order to design efficient space launch vehicles. He was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was in fact to develop a vehicle for flights into space, since most scientists, especially in the United States, did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit, nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas. Later, in 1933, Goddard said that \"[I]n no case must we allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel, test by test and step by step, until one day we succeed, cost what it may.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|65,67,74,101}}\n\n===Fight to survive===\nIn early 1913, Goddard became seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]] and had to leave his position at Princeton. He then returned to Worcester, where he began a prolonged process of recovery at home. His doctors did not expect him to live. He decided he should spend time outside in the fresh air and walk for exercise, and he gradually improved.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61\u201364}} When his nurse discovered some of his notes in his bed, he kept them, arguing, \"I have to live to do this work.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|66}}\n\nIt was during this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most important work. As his symptoms subsided, he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. He was afraid that nobody would be able to read his scribbling should he \nsuccumb.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n===Foundational patents===\nIn the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, [[patents]] were considered essential, not only to protect original work but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure those ideas before someone else did\u2014and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote descriptions concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent lawyer in  Worcester who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard's first patent application was submitted in October 1913.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|63\u201370}}\n\nIn 1914, his first two landmark patents were accepted and registered. The first, {{US patent|1102653}}, described a multi-stage rocket fueled with a solid \"explosive material.\" The second, {{US patent|1103503}}, described a rocket fueled with a [[solid fuel]] (explosive material) or with [[liquid propellant]]s (gasoline and liquid nitrous oxide). The two patents would eventually become important milestones in the history of rocketry.<ref name=\"Sea and Sky: Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.seasky.org/spacexp/sky5d1.html\n  | title = Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\n  | publisher = Sea and Sky}}</ref><ref name=\"Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.russianspaceweb.com/chronology_XX.html\n  | title = Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\n  | publisher = Russian Space Web}}</ref> Overall, 214 patents were published, some posthumously by his wife.\n\n== Early rocketry research ==\n[[File:Robert Goddard footage.ogv|thumb|right|Video clips of Goddard's launches and other events in his life]]\nIn the fall of 1914, Goddard's health had improved, and he accepted a part-time position as an instructor and research fellow at Clark University.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|73}} His position at Clark allowed him to further his rocketry research. He ordered numerous supplies that could be used to build rocket prototypes for launch and spent much of 1915 in preparation for his first tests. Goddard's first test launch of a powder rocket came on an early evening in 1915 following his daytime classes at Clark.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|74}} The launch was loud and bright enough to arouse the alarm of the campus janitor, and Goddard had to reassure him that his experiments, while being serious study, were also quite harmless. After this incident, Goddard took his experiments inside the physics lab, in order to limit any disturbance.\n\nAt the Clark physics lab, Goddard conducted static tests of powder rockets to measure their thrust and efficiency. He found his earlier estimates to be verified; powder rockets were converting only about two percent of the thermal energy in their fuel into thrust and kinetic energy. At this point he applied [[de Laval nozzle]]s, which were generally used with steam turbine engines, and these greatly improved efficiency. (Of the several definitions of rocket efficiency, Goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the ''internal efficiency'' of the engine: the ratio of the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion, expressed as a percentage.)<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|130}} By mid-summer of 1915, Goddard had obtained an average efficiency of 40 percent with a nozzle exit velocity of {{nowrap|6728 feet (2051 meters) per second}}.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|75}} Connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion (de Laval) nozzles, Goddard was able in static tests to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63% and exhaust velocities of over 7000 feet (2134 meters) per second.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|78}}\n\nFew would recognize it at the time, but this little engine was a major breakthrough. These experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape Earth and travel into space. This engine and subsequent experiments sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution were the beginning of modern rocketry and, ultimately, space exploration.<ref name=\"Pendray\">{{cite book|last=Pendray|first=G.

Webster, the world-renowned head of Clark's physics department,  Goddard arranged for the Smithsonian to publish the paper,  ''A Method...,'' which documented his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nWhile at Clark University, Goddard did research into solar power using a parabolic dish to concentrate the Sun's rays on a machined piece of [[quartz]], that was sprayed with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which then heated water and drove an electric generator. Goddard believed his invention had overcome all the obstacles that had previously defeated other scientists and inventors, and he had his findings published in the November 1929 issue of  ''Popular Science''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 \"A New Invention To Harness The Sun\"], ''Popular Science'', November 1929.</ref>\n\n===Goddard's military rocket===\nNot all of Goddard's early work was geared towards space travel. As the United States entered World War I in 1917, the country's universities began to lend their services to the war effort. Goddard believed his rocket research could be applied to many different military applications, including mobile artillery, field weapons and naval [[torpedo]]es. He made proposals to the Navy and Army. No record exists in his papers of any interest by the Navy to Goddard's inquiry. However, Army Ordnance was quite interested, and Goddard met several times with Army personnel.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89}}\n\nDuring this time, Goddard was also contacted, in early 1918, by a civilian industrialist in Worcester about the possibility of manufacturing rockets for the military. However, as the businessman's enthusiasm grew, so did Goddard's suspicion. Talks eventually broke down as Goddard began to fear his work might be appropriated by the business. However, an [[Army Signal Corps]] officer tried to make Goddard cooperate, but he was called off by General [[George Squier]] of the Signal Corps who had been contacted by Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89\u201391}} Goddard became leery of working with corporations and was careful to secure patents to \"protect his ideas.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|152}} These events led to the Signal Corps sponsoring Goddard's work during World War I.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nGoddard proposed to the Army an idea for a tube-based rocket launcher as a light infantry weapon. The launcher concept became the precursor to the [[bazooka]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|92}} The rocket-powered, recoil-free weapon was the brainchild of Goddard as a side project (under Army contract) of his work on rocket propulsion. Goddard, during his [[tenure]] at [[Clark University]], and working at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] for security reasons, designed the tube-fired rocket for military use during World War I. He and his co-worker, Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]] successfully demonstrated his rocket to the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Maryland]], on November 6, 1918, using two music stands for a launch platform. The Army was impressed, but the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Compi\u00e8gne Armistice]] was signed only five days later, and further development was discontinued as World War I ended.<ref name=\"NASA \u2013 Dr. Robert H.

Goddard continued to be a part-time consultant to the U.S. Government at [[Indian Head, Maryland]],<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|121}} until 1923, but his focus had turned to other research involving rocket propulsion, including work with liquid fuels and liquid oxygen.\n\nLater, the former Clark University researcher Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]], and Army officers Col. [[Leslie Skinner]] and Lt. [[Edward Uhl]] continued Goddard's work on the bazooka. A [[shaped-charge]] warhead was attached to the rocket, leading to the tank-killing weapon used in World War II and to many other powerful rocket weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|305}}\n\n== ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes'' ==\n\nIn 1919 Goddard thought that it would be premature to disclose the results of his experiments because his engine was not sufficiently developed. Dr. Webster realized that Goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that Goddard publish his progress so far or he would take care of it himself, so Goddard asked the Smithsonian Institution if it would publish the report, updated with footnotes, that he had submitted in late 1916.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nIn late 1919, the Smithsonian published Goddard's groundbreaking work, ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''. The report describes Goddard's mathematical theories of rocket flight, his experiments with solid-fuel rockets, and the possibilities he saw of exploring Earth's atmosphere and beyond.

Included as a [[thought experiment]] was the idea of launching a rocket to the Moon and igniting a mass of flash powder on its surface, so as to be visible through a telescope. He discussed the matter seriously, down to an estimate of the amount of powder required. Goddard's conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 3.21 tons could produce a flash \"just visible\" from Earth, assuming a final payload weight of 10.7 pounds.<ref name=\"Method\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Goddard|editor1-first=Esther C. |editor2-first=G.

He did, though, publish and talk about the rocket principle and [[sounding rockets]], since these subjects were not too \"far out.\" In a letter to the Smithsonian, dated March 1920, he discussed: photographing the Moon and planets from rocket-powered fly-by probes, sending messages to distant civilizations on inscribed metal plates, the use of solar energy in space, and the idea of high-velocity ion propulsion. In that same letter, Goddard clearly describes the concept of the [[Atmospheric reentry#Ablative|ablative heat shield]], suggesting the landing apparatus be covered with \"layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between\" designed to erode in the same way as the surface of a meteor.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/stories/march-1920-report-concerning-further-developments-space-travel\n|last=Goddard  |first=Robert H.\n  |title=Report Concerning Further Developments\n  |date=March 1920\n  |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution Archives\n}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |bgcolor=#F5F5F5 |salign=center |align=right |width=33% |quote=Every vision is a joke until the first man accomplishes it; once realized, it becomes commonplace.|source=&ndash;Response to a reporter's question following criticism in ''The New York Times'', 1920.<ref name=\"Clark University\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www2.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm#nyt\n|title=When was the famous New York Times editorial about Dr. Goddard?\n|publisher=Clark University\n|accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref><ref name=\"NASA\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/f_goddard.html\n|title=Robert Goddard: A Man and His Rocket\n|publisher=NASA\n|accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>}}\n\n===Publicity and criticism===\nThe publication of Goddard's document gained him national attention from U.S. newspapers, most of it negative. Although Goddard's discussion of targeting the moon was only a small part of the work as a whole (eight lines on the next to last page of 69 pages), and was intended as an illustration of the possibilities rather than a declaration of intent, the papers sensationalized his ideas to the point of misrepresentation and ridicule. Even the Smithsonian had to abstain from publicity because of the amount of ridiculous correspondence received from the general public.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|113}} David Lasser, who co-founded the [[American Rocket Society]] (ARS), wrote in 1931 that Goddard was subjected in the press to the \"most violent attacks.\"<ref name=\"Lasser\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Lasser|editor1-first=David |editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Godwin |title=The Conquest of Space|year=2002|publisher=Apogee Books|location=Burlington, Ontario|isbn=1-896522-92-0|page=38}}</ref>\n\nOn January 12, 1920, a front-page story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"Believes Rocket Can Reach Moon\", reported a Smithsonian press release about a \"multiple-charge, high-efficiency rocket.\" The chief application envisaged was \"the possibility of sending recording apparatus to moderate and extreme altitudes within the Earth's atmosphere\", the advantage over balloon-carried instruments being ease of recovery, since \"the new rocket apparatus would go straight up and come straight down.\" But it also mentioned a proposal \"to [send] to the dark part of the new moon a sufficiently large amount of the most brilliant flash powder which, in being ignited on impact, would be plainly visible in a powerful telescope. This would be the only way of proving that the rocket had really left the attraction of the earth, as the apparatus would never come back, once it had escaped that attraction.\"<ref>{{cite news\n  |title=Believes Rocket Can Reach Moon.

Such a rocket, too, might carry self-recording instruments, to be released at the limit of its flight, and conceivable parachutes would bring them safely to the ground.

Unbeknownst to the ''Times'', thrust is possible in a vacuum, as the writer would have discovered had he read Goddard's paper.<ref>{{cite book\n|editor=Newton, Isaac\n|title=Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, 2nd ed\n|publisher=\n|location=London\n|year=1713\n|pages=\n|isbn=\n|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/newton-principia/}}\n</ref>\n\n====Aftermath====\nA week after the ''New York Times'' editorial, Goddard released a signed statement to the [[Associated Press]], attempting to restore reason to what had become a sensational story:\n<blockquote>Too much attention has been concentrated on the proposed flash pow[d]er experiment, and too little on the exploration of the atmosphere. ... Whatever interesting possibilities there may be of the method that has been proposed, other than the purpose for which it was intended, no one of them could be undertaken without first exploring the atmosphere.<ref>{{cite news |title=Goddard Rockets To Take Pictures |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 19, 1920 |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9E05E2DF103AE033A2575AC1A9679C946195D6CF}}\n</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nIn 1924, Goddard published an article, \"How my speed rocket can propel itself in vacuum\", in ''[[Popular Science]]'', in which he explained the physics and gave details of the vacuum experiments he had performed to prove the theory.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Goddard |first=Robert |title=How my speed rocket can propel itself in vacuum |url=http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=DikDAAAAMBAJ&pg=38 |work=[[Popular Science]] |date=September 1924 |page=38}}</ref> But, no matter how he tried to explain his results, he was not understood by the majority. After one of Goddard's experiments in 1929, a local Worcester newspaper carried the mocking headline \"Moon rocket misses target by 238,799{{frac|1|2}}&nbsp;miles.\"<ref>{{cite book\n|editor=Nelson, Craig\n|title=Rocket Men: The Epic Story of the First Men on the Moon\n|publisher=\n|location=\n|year=1713\n|pages=\n|isbn=9781101057735\n|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LWMivGgbM7kC&pg=PT96 }}\n</ref>\n\nThough the unimaginitive of the public chuckled at the \"moon man,\" his groundbreaking paper was read seriously by many rocketeers in America, Europe, and Russia who were stirred to build their own rockets. This work was his most important contribution to the quest to \"aim for the stars.\" <ref name= \"Gainor\" />{{rp|50}}\n\nGoddard worked alone with just his team of mechanics and machinists for many years.  This was a result of the harsh criticism from the media and other scientists, and his understanding of the military applications which foreign powers might use. Goddard became increasingly suspicious of others and often worked alone, except during the two World Wars, which limited the impact of much of his work. Another limiting factor was the lack of support from the American government, military and academia, all failing to understand the value of the rocket to study the atmosphere and near space, and for military applications. As Germany became ever more war-like, he refused to communicate with German rocket experimenters, though he received more and more of their correspondence.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|131}}\n\n===='A Correction'====\nForty-nine years after its editorial mocking Goddard, on July 17, 1969\u2014the day after the launch of [[Apollo 11]]\u2014''The New York Times'' published a short item under the headline \"A Correction.\" The three-paragraph statement summarized its 1920 editorial and concluded:\n<blockquote>Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.<ref>''The New York Times'', July 17, 1969, p. 43,</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==First liquid-fueled flight==\n\nGoddard began considering liquid propellants, including hydrogen and oxygen, as early as 1909. He knew that hydrogen and oxygen was the most efficient fuel/oxidizer combination. Liquid hydrogen was not readily available in 1921, however, and he selected gasoline as the safest fuel to handle.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|13}}\n\n===First static tests===\n[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Robert Goddard, bundled against the cold weather of March 16, 1926, holds the launching frame of his most notable invention \u2014 the first liquid-fueled rocket.]]\nGoddard began experimenting with liquid oxidizer, [[liquid fuel rocket]]s in September 1921, and successfully tested the first liquid propellant engine in November 1923.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|520}} It had a cylindrical [[combustion chamber]], using impinging jets to mix and atomize [[liquid oxygen]] and [[gasoline]].<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|499\u2013500}}\n\nIn 1924\u201325, Goddard had problems developing a high-pressure [[piston pump]] to send fuel to the combustion chamber. He wanted to scale up the experiments, but his funding would not allow such growth. He decided to forego the pumps and use a pressurized fuel feed system applying pressure to the fuel tank from a tank of [[inert gas]], a technique used today. The liquid oxygen, some of which evaporated,  provided its own pressure.\n\nOn December 6, 1925, he tested the simpler pressure feed system. He conducted a static test on the firing stand at the Clark University physics laboratory. The engine successfully lifted its own weight in a 27-second test in the static rack. It was a major success for Goddard, proving that a liquid fuel rocket was possible.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|140}} The test moved Goddard an important step closer to launching a rocket with liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard conducted an additional test in December, and two more in January 1926. After that, he began preparing for a possible launch of the rocket system.\n\n===First flight===\nGoddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled ([[bipropellant rocket|gasoline and liquid oxygen]]) rocket on March 16, 1926, in [[Auburn, Massachusetts]]. Present at the launch were his crew chief Henry Sachs, Esther Goddard, and Percy Roope, who was Clark's assistant professor in the physics department. Goddard's diary entry of the event was notable for its understatement:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 16. Went to Auburn with S[achs] in am. E[sther] and Mr. Roope came out at 1 p.m. Tried rocket at 2.30. It rose 41 feet & went 184 feet, in 2.5 secs., after the lower half of the nozzle burned off. Brought materials to lab. ...<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHis diary entry the next day elaborated:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 17, 1926. The first flight with a rocket using liquid propellants was made yesterday at Aunt Effie's farm in Auburn. ... \nEven though the release was pulled, the rocket did not rise at first, but the flame came out, and there was a steady roar. After a number of seconds it rose, slowly until it cleared the frame, and then at express train speed, curving over to the left, and striking the ice and snow, still going at a rapid rate.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe rocket, which was later dubbed \"Nell\", rose just 41&nbsp;feet during a 2.5-second flight that ended 184 feet away in a cabbage field,<ref>{{cite book|last=Streissguth|first=Thomas|title=Rocket man: the story of Robert Goddard|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=1995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37 37]|isbn=0-87614-863-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37}}</ref> but it was an important demonstration that liquid fuels and oxidizers were possible propellants for larger rockets. The launch site is now a [[National Historic Landmark]], the [[Goddard Rocket Launching Site]].\n\nViewers familiar with more modern rocket designs may find it difficult to distinguish the rocket from its launching apparatus in the well-known picture of \"Nell\". The complete rocket is significantly taller than Goddard but does not include the pyramidal support structure which he is grasping. The rocket's [[combustion chamber]] is the small cylinder at the top; the [[nozzle]] is visible beneath it. The fuel tank, which is also part of the rocket, is the larger cylinder opposite Goddard's torso. The fuel tank is directly beneath the nozzle and is protected from the motor's exhaust by an [[asbestos]] cone. Asbestos-wrapped aluminum tubes connect the motor to the tanks, providing both support and fuel transport.<ref>[http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf NASA, ''Discover NASA and You''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527221503/http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }}.</ref> This layout is no longer used, since the experiment showed that this was [[Pendulum rocket fallacy|no more stable]] than placing the combustion chamber and nozzle at the base. By May, after a series of modifications to simplify the plumbing, the combustion chamber and nozzle were placed in the now classic position, at the lower end of the rocket.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|259}}\n\nGoddard determined early that fins alone were not sufficient to stabilize the rocket in flight and keep it on the desired trajectory in the face of winds aloft and other disturbing forces. He added movable vanes in the exhaust, controlled by a gyroscope, to control and steer his rocket. (The Germans used this technique in their V-2.) He also introduced the more efficient swiveling engine in several rockets, basically the method used to steer large liquid-propellant missiles and launchers today.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|263\u20136}}\n\n==Lindbergh and Goddard==\n\nAfter launch of one of Goddard's rockets in July 1929 again gained the attention of the newspapers,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9tbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wlINAAAAIBAJ&dq=rocket%20accident&pg=4275%2C2780242 \"Giant Rocket Alarms Many\"], ''St. Joseph, Missouri Gazette'', July 18, 1929.</ref> [[Charles Lindbergh]] learned of his work in a ''New York Times'' article. At the time, Lindbergh had begun to wonder what would become of [[aviation]] (even space flight) in the distant future and had settled on jet propulsion and rocket flight as a probable next step. After checking with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and being assured that Goddard was a bona fide physicist and not a crackpot, he phoned Goddard in November 1929.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|141}} Professor Goddard met the aviator soon after in his office at Clark University.<ref name=\"lehm\">{{cite journal|last=Lehman|first=Milton|date=October 4, 1963|title=How Lindbergh Gave a Lift to Rocketry|journal=LIFE Magazine|volume=55|issue=14|pages=115\u2013127|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uFIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA115|accessdate=15 Mar 2010}}</ref> Upon meeting Goddard, Lindbergh was immediately impressed by his research, and Goddard was similarly impressed by the flier's interest.

He was finding it increasingly difficult to conduct his research without unwanted distractions. Lindbergh discussed finding additional financing for Goddard's work and lent his famous name to Goddard's work. In 1930 Lindbergh made several proposals to industry and private investors for funding, which proved all but impossible to find following the recent [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|U.S. stock market crash]] in October 1929.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\n===Guggenheim sponsorship===\nIn the spring of 1930, Lindbergh finally found an ally in the [[Guggenheim family]]. Financier [[Daniel Guggenheim]] agreed to fund Goddard's research over the next four years for a total of $100,000 (~${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1932|r=-5}}}} today). The Guggenheim family, especially [[Harry Frank Guggenheim|Harry Guggenheim]], would continue to support Goddard's work in the years to come. The Goddards soon moved to [[Roswell, New Mexico]] <ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBecause of the military potential of the rocket, Goddard, Lindbergh, Harry Guggenheim, the Smithsonian Institution and others tried in 1940, before the U.S. entered World War II, to convince the Army and Navy of its value. Goddard's services were offered, but there was no interest, initially. Two young, imaginative military officers eventually got the services to attempt to contract with Goddard just prior to the war. The Navy beat the Army to the punch and secured his services to build variable-thrust, liquid-fueled rocket engines for jet-assisted take-off (JATO) of aircraft.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|293\u2013297}} These rocket engines were the precursors to the larger throttlable rocket plane engines that helped launch the space age.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The X-Planes|last=Miller|first=Jay|publisher=Orion Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=43,128\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAstronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] wrote that his father, Edwin Aldrin Sr. \"was an early supporter of Robert Goddard.\"  The elder Aldrin was a student of physics under Goddard at Clark, and worked with Lindbergh to obtain the help of the Guggenheims. Buzz believed that if Goddard had received military support as von Braun's team had in Germany, American rocket technology would have developed much more rapidly in World War II.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Men from Earth|last=Aldrin|first=Buzz|last2=McConnell|first2=Malcolm|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1989|isbn=0-553-05374-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/ xx,21]|url=https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/}}</ref>\n\n===Lack of vision in the United States===\nBefore World War II there was a lack of vision and serious interest in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard's rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|719,746}} Between the World Wars, the [[Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] was the main source of funding for Goddard's research.<ref name=\"Braun\" />{{rp|46,59,60}} Goddard's liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian [[Eugene Emme]], but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans.<ref name=\"Emme\" />{{rp|63}} Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he \"would not be surprised if the research would become something in the nature of a race,\" and he wondered how soon the European \"theorists\" would begin to build rockets.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|136}}\nIn 1936, the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Berlin asked Charles Lindbergh to visit Germany and learn what he could of their progress in aviation. Although the Luftwaffe showed him their factories and were open concerning their growing airpower, they were silent on the subject of rocketry. When Lindbergh told Goddard of this behavior, Goddard said, \"Yes, they must have plans for the rocket. When will our own people in Washington listen to reason?\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|272}}\n\nMost of the U.S.'s largest universities were also slow to realize rocketry's potential. Just before World War II, the head of the aeronautics department at MIT, at a meeting held by the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] to discuss project funding, said that the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) \"can take the Buck Rogers Job [rocket research].\"<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite book|last=Carter|first=John|title=Sex and Rockets|year=1999|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|page=31}}</ref> In 1941, Goddard tried to recruit an engineer for his team from MIT but couldn't find one who was interested.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|326}}  There were some exceptions: MIT was at least teaching basic rocketry,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|264}} and Caltech had courses in rocketry and aerodynamics. After the war, Dr. Jerome Hunsaker of MIT, having studied Goddard's patents, stated that \"Every liquid-fuel rocket that flies is a Goddard rocket.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|363}}\n\nWhile away in Roswell, Goddard was still head of the physics department at Clark University, and Clark allowed him to devote most of his time to rocket research. Likewise, the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) permitted astronomer [[Samuel Herrick (astronomer)|Samuel Herrick]] to pursue research in space vehicle guidance and control, and shortly after the war to teach courses in spacecraft guidance and orbit determination. Herrick began corresponding with Goddard in 1931 and asked if he should work in this new field, which he named [[astrodynamics]]. Herrick said that Goddard had the vision to advise and encourage him in his use of [[celestial mechanics]] \"to anticipate the basic problem of space navigation.\" Herrick's work contributed substantially to America's readiness to control flight of Earth satellites and send men to the Moon and back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=vt/viblbv00753.xml|title=Samuel Herrick Papers 1930-1974|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Roswell, New Mexico==\n[[File:RobertHGoddardRocket TopDown.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Lindbergh]] took this picture of Robert H.

He had consulted a meteorologist as to the best area to do his work, and Roswell seemed ideal. Here they would not endanger anyone, would not be bothered by the curious and would experience a more moderate climate (which was also better for Goddard's health).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|177}} The locals valued personal privacy, knew Goddard desired his, and when travelers asked where Goddard's facilities were located, they would likely be misdirected.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|261}}\n\nBy September 1931, his rockets had the now familiar appearance of a smooth casing with tail-fins. He began experimenting with [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] guidance and made a flight test of such a system in April 1932. A gyroscope mounted on gimbals electrically controlled steering vanes in the exhaust, similar to the system used by the German [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] over 10&nbsp;years later. Though the rocket crashed after a short ascent, the guidance system had worked, and Goddard considered the test a success.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|193\u20135}}\n\nA temporary loss of funding from the Guggenheims, as a result of the depression, forced Goddard in spring of 1932 to return to his much-loathed professorial responsibilities at Clark University.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clary |first1=David |title=Rocket Man |date=2003 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |isbn=978-0786887057 |pages=165\u2013166}}</ref> He remained at the university until the autumn of 1934, when funding resumed.<ref name=\"The Papers of Robert H.

Goddard\"/> Upon his return to Roswell, he began work on his A series of rockets, 4 to 4.5&nbsp;meters long, and powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen pressurized with nitrogen. The gyroscopic control system was housed in the middle of the rocket, between the propellant tanks.<ref name=\"RockDev\">{{cite book|last=Goddard|first=Robert and editors Esther C. Goddard and G. Edward Pendray|title=Rocket Development|year=1961|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|xv,15\u201346}}\n\nThe A-4 used a simpler pendulum system for guidance, as the gyroscopic system was being repaired. On March 8, 1935, it flew up to 1,000 feet, then turned into the wind and, Goddard reported, \"roared in a powerful descent across the prairie, at close to, or at, the speed of sound.\" On March 28, 1935, the A-5 successfully flew vertically to an altitude of (0.91&nbsp;mi; 4,800&nbsp;ft) using his gyroscopic guidance system. It then turned to a nearly horizontal path, flew 13,000 feet and achieved a maximum speed of 550 miles per hour. Goddard was elated because the guidance system kept the rocket on a vertical path so well.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|208}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|978\u20139}}\n\nIn 1936\u20131939, Goddard began work on the K and L series rockets, which were much more massive and designed to reach very high altitude. The K series consisted of static bench tests of a more powerful engine, achieving a thrust of 624&nbsp;lbs in February 1936.<ref name=\"Braun\">{{cite book|last=Von Braun|first=Wernher and Frederick I. Ordway III|title=History of Rocketry and Space Travel, revised Edition|year=1969|publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Co.|location=New York|page=50}}</ref>  This work was plagued by trouble with chamber burn-through. In 1923, Goddard had built a regeneratively cooled engine, which circulated liquid oxygen around the outside of the combustion chamber, but he deemed the idea too complicated. He then used a curtain cooling method that involved spraying excess gasoline, which evaporated around the inside wall of the combustion chamber, but this scheme did not work well, and the larger rockets failed. Goddard returned to a smaller design, and his L-13 reached an altitude of 2.7 kilometers (1.7&nbsp;mi; 8,900&nbsp;ft), the highest of any of his rockets. Weight was reduced by using thin-walled fuel tanks wound with high-tensile-strength wire.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|71\u2013148}}\n\nGoddard experimented with many of the features of today's large rockets, such as multiple combustion chambers and nozzles. In November 1936, he flew the world's first rocket (L-7) with multiple chambers, hoping to increase thrust without increasing the size of a single chamber. It had four combustion chambers, reached a height of 200 feet, and corrected its vertical path using blast vanes until one chamber burned through. This flight demonstrated that a rocket with multiple combustion chambers could fly stably and be easily guided.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|96}} In July 1937 he replaced the guidance vanes with a movable tail section containing a single combustion chamber, as if on gimbals ([[thrust vectoring]]). The flight was of low altitude, but a large disturbance, probably caused by a change in the wind velocity, was corrected back to vertical. In an August test the flight path was corrected seven times by the movable tail and was captured on film by Mrs Goddard.<ref name= \"RockDev\" />{{rp|113\u2013116}}\n\nFrom 1940 to 1941, Goddard worked on the P series of rockets, which used propellant turbopumps (also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen). The lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures, permitting a more powerful engine (greater thrust) and a lighter structure (lighter tanks and no pressurization tank), but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching an altitude of only a few hundred feet. The turbopumps worked well, however, and Goddard was pleased.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|187\u2013215}}\n\nWhen Goddard mentioned the need for turbopumps, Harry Guggenheim suggested that he contact pump manufacturers to aid him. None were interested, as the development cost of these miniature pumps was prohibitive. Goddard's team was therefore left on its own and from September 1938 to June 1940 designed and tested the small turbopumps and gas generators to operate the turbines. Esther later said that the pump tests were \"the most trying and disheartening phase of the research.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274\u20135}}\n\nGoddard was able to flight-test many of his rockets, but many resulted in what the uninitiated would call failures, usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control. Goddard did not consider them failures, however, because he felt that he always learned something from a test.<ref name=\"Gainor\" />{{rp|45}} Most of his work involved static tests, which are a standard procedure today, before a flight test. He wrote to a correspondent:  \"It is not a simple matter to differentiate unsuccessful from successful experiments. ... [Most] work that is finally successful is the result of a series of unsuccessful tests in which difficulties are gradually eliminated.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274}}\n\n===General Jimmy Doolittle===\n[[Jimmy Doolittle]] was introduced to the field of space science at an early point in its history. He recalls in his autobiography, \"I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation. ... While with Shell Oil I worked with him on the development of a type of fuel. ... \"<ref name=Jimmy>{{cite book|last1=Doolittle|first1=James H. \"Jimmy\"|title=I Could Never Be So Lucky Again|date=1991|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|page=515}}</ref> Harry Guggenheim and Charles Lindbergh arranged for (then Major) Doolittle to discuss with Goddard a special blend of gasoline. Doolittle flew himself to Roswell in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddard's shop and a \"short course\" in rocketry.  He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddard's rocket. In closing he said, \"interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away\u2014who knows!\" In July 1941, he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in his rocket propulsion research. The Army was interested only in JATO at this point. However, Doolittle and Lindbergh were concerned about the state of rocketry in the US, and Doolittle remained in touch with Goddard.<ref name=Method/>{{rp|1208\u201316,1334,1443}}\n\nShortly after World War II, Doolittle spoke concerning Goddard to an [[American Rocket Society]] (ARS) conference at which a  large number interested in rocketry attended. He later stated that at that time \"we [in the aeronautics field] had not given much credence to the tremendous potential of rocketry.\"<ref name=Putnam>{{cite book|last1=Putnam|first1=William D. and Eugene M.

Simply reaching high altitudes was not his primary goal; he was trying, with a methodical approach, to perfect his liquid fuel engine and subsystems such as guidance and control so that his rocket could eventually achieve high altitudes without tumbling in the rare atmosphere, providing a stable vehicle for the experiments it would eventually carry. He had built the necessary turbopumps and was on the verge of building larger, lighter, more reliable rockets to reach extreme altitudes carrying scientific instruments when World War II intervened and changed the path of American history. He hoped to return to his experiments in Roswell after the war.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|206,230,330\u20131}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|923\u20134}}\n\nThough by the end of the Roswell years much of his technology had been replicated independently by others, he introduced new developments to rocketry that were used in this new enterprise: lightweight turbopumps, variable-thrust engine (in U.S.), engine with multiple combustion chambers and nozzles, and curtain cooling of combustion chamber.\n\nAlthough Goddard had brought his work in rocketry to the attention of the [[United States Army]], between World Wars, he was rebuffed, since the Army largely failed to grasp the military application of large rockets and said there was no money for new experimental weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|297}} German military intelligence, by contrast, had paid attention to Goddard's work. The Goddards noticed that some mail had been opened, and some mailed reports had gone missing. An accredited [[military attach\u00e9]] to the US, Friedrich von Boetticher, sent a four-page report to the ''[[Abwehr]]'' in 1936, and the spy Gustav Guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information, claiming to have visited Roswell and witnessed a launch.

Fischer, who had visited Goddard in Roswell earlier and gained his confidence, believed Goddard was doing valuable work and was able to convince the Bureau of Aeronautics in September 1941 that Goddard could build the JATO unit the Navy desired. While still in Roswell, and before the Navy contract took effect, Goddard began in September to apply his technology to build a variable-thrust engine to be attached to a [[PBY]] seaplane. By May 1942, he had a unit that could meet the Navy's requirements and be able to launch a heavily loaded aircraft from a short runway. In February, he received part of a PBY with bullet holes apparently acquired in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack. Goddard wrote to Guggenheim that \"I can think of nothing that would give me greater satisfaction than to have it contribute to the inevitable retaliation.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|322,328\u20139,331,335,337}}\n\nIn April, Fischer notified Goddard that the Navy wanted to do all its rocket work at the Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis. Esther, worried that a move to the climate of Maryland would cause Robert's health to deteriorate faster, objected. But the patriotic Goddard replied, \"Esther, don't you know there's a war on?\" Fischer also questioned the move, as Goddard could work just as well in Roswell. Goddard simply answered, \"I was wondering when you would ask me.\" Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger\u2014a long range missile\u2014but JATO was all he could manage, hoping for a greater project later.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|338,9}} It was a case of a square peg in a round hole, according to a disappointed Goddard.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|209}}\n\nGoddard and his team had already been in Annapolis a month and had tested his constant-thrust JATO engine when he received a Navy telegram, forwarded from Roswell, ordering him to Annapolis. Lt. Fischer asked for a crash effort. By August, his engine was producing 800&nbsp;lbs of thrust for 20 seconds, and Fischer was anxious to try it on a PBY. On the sixth test run, with all bugs worked out, the PBY, piloted by Fischer, was pushed into the air from the Severn River. Fischer landed and prepared to launch again. Goddard had wanted to check the unit, but radio contact with the PBY had been lost. On the seventh try, the engine caught fire. The plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted. Because Goddard had installed a safety feature at the last minute, there was no explosion and no lives were lost. The problem's cause was traced to hasty installation and rough handling. Cheaper, safer solid fuel JATO engines were eventually selected by the armed forces. An engineer later said, \"Putting [Goddard's] rocket on a seaplane was like hitching an eagle to a plow.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|344\u201350}}\n\nMilton Lehman notes:\n<blockquote>\nIn its 1942 crash effort to perfect an aircraft booster, the Navy was beginning to learn its way in rocketry. In similar efforts, the Army Air Corps was also exploring the field [with [[GALCIT]]]. Compared to Germany's massive program, these beginnings were small, yet essential to later progress. They helped develop a nucleus of trained American rocket engineers, the first of the new breed who would follow the professor into the Age of Space.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|350}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn August, 1943, President Atwood at Clark wrote to Goddard that the University was losing the acting head of the Physics Department, was taking on \"emergency work\" for the Army, and he was to \"report for duty or declare the position vacant.\" Goddard replied that he believed he was needed by he Navy, was nearing retirement age, and was unable to lecture because of his throat problem, which did not allow allow him to talk above a whisper. He regretfully resigned as Professor of Physics and expressed his deepest appreciation for all Atwood and the Trustees had done for him and indirectly for the war effort.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1509\u201311}} In June he had gone to see a throat specialist in Baltimore, who recommended that he not talk at all, to give his throat a rest.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1503}}\n  \nThe station, under Lt Commander Robert Truax, was developing another JATO engine in 1942 that used [[hypergolic propellant]]<nowiki/>s, eliminating the need for an ignition system.

Goddard made improvements to the engine, and in November it was demonstrated to the Navy and some officials from Washington. Fischer invited the spectators to operate the controls; the engine blasted out over the Severn at full throttle with no hesitation, idled, and roared again at various thrust levels. The test was perfect, exceeding the Navy's requirements. The unit was able to be stopped and restarted, and it produced a medium thrust of 600 pounds for 15 seconds and a full thrust of 1,000 pounds for over 15 seconds. A Navy Commander commented that \"It was like being Thor, playing with thunderbolts.\" Goddard had produced the essential propulsion control system of the rocket plane. The Goddards celebrated by attending the Army-Navy football game and attending the Fischers' cocktail party.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|350\u20131}}\n\nThis engine was the basis of the Curtiss-Wright XLR25-CW-1 two-chamber, 15,000-pound variable-thrust engine that powered the [[Bell X-2]] research rocket plane.

Though the design details were not exactly the same, the basic design of the V-2 was similar to one of Goddard's rockets. The V-2, however, was technically far more advanced than the most successful of the rockets designed and tested by Goddard. The [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center|Peenem\u00fcnde rocket group]] led by [[Wernher von Braun]] may have benefited from the pre-1939 contacts to a limited extent,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|387\u20138}} but had also started from the work of their own space pioneer, [[Hermann Oberth]]; they also had the benefit of intensive state funding, large-scale production facilities (using slave labor), and repeated flight-testing that allowed them to refine their designs. Oberth was a theorist and had never built a rocket, but he tested small liquid propellant thrust chambers in 1929-30 which were not advancements in the \"state of the art.\"<ref name= \"Sutton\" />{{rp|273,275}} In 1922 Oberth asked Goddard for a copy of his 1919 paper and was sent one.<ref name= \"Clary\" />{{rp|96}}\n\nNevertheless, in 1963, von Braun, reflecting on the history of rocketry, said of Goddard: \"His rockets ... may have been rather crude by present-day standards, but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/recollect-childhood.html |title=Recollections of Childhood/Early Experiences in Rocketry |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> He once recalled that \"Goddard's experiments in liquid fuel saved us years of work, and enabled us to perfect the V-2 years before it would have been possible.\"<ref name=\"Levine\">{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Alan J.|title=The Missile and Space Race|year=1994|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-275-94451-4|page=3}}</ref> After  World War II von Braun reviewed Goddard's patents and believed they contained enough technical information to build a large missile.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aldrin|first1=Buzz, Malcolm McConnel|title=Men From Earth|date=1989|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|page=21}}</ref>\n\nThree features developed by Goddard appeared in the V-2: (1) turbopumps were used to inject fuel into the combustion chamber; (2) gyroscopically controlled vanes in the nozzle stabilized the rocket until external vanes in the air could do so; and (3) excess alcohol was fed in around the combustion chamber walls, so that a blanket of evaporating gas protected the engine walls from the combustion heat.\n<ref>{{cite book\n  |last=Burchard |first=John E.

General [[Walter Dornberger]], head of the V-2 project, used the idea that they were in a race with the U.S. and that Goddard had \"disappeared\" (to work with the Navy) as a way to persuade Hitler to raise the priority of the V-2.\n\n== Goddard's secrecy ==\nGoddard avoided sharing details of his work with other scientists and preferred to work alone with his technicians. [[Frank Malina]], who was then studying rocketry at the [[California Institute of Technology]], visited Goddard in August 1936. Goddard hesitated to discuss any of his research, other than that which had already been published in ''Liquid-Propellant Rocket Development''. [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]], Malina's mentor at the time, was unhappy with Goddard's attitude and later wrote, \"Naturally we at Caltech wanted as much information as we could get from Goddard for our mutual benefit. But Goddard believed in secrecy. ... The trouble with secrecy is that one can easily go in the wrong direction and never know it.\" <ref name=\"Burrows\" />{{rp|90}} However, at an earlier point, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n said that Malina was \"highly enthusiastic\" after his visit and that Caltech made changes to their liquid-propellant rocket, based on Goddard's work and patents. Malina remembered his visit as friendly and that he saw all but a few components in Goddard's shop.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|178}}\n\nGoddard's concerns about secrecy led to criticism for failure to cooperate with other scientists and engineers. His approach at that time was that independent development of his ideas without interference would bring quicker results even though he received less technical support. George Sutton, who became a rocket scientist working with von Braun's team in the late 1940s, said that he and his fellow workers had not heard of Goddard or his contributions and that they would have saved time if they had known the details of his work. Sutton admits that it may have been their fault for not looking for Goddard's patents and depending on the German team for knowledge and guidance; he wrote that information about the patents was not well distributed in the U.S. at that early period after World War II, though Germany and the Soviet Union had copies of some of them. (The Patent Office did not release rocket patents during World War II.)<ref name=\"Sutton\">{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, Virginia|pages=267, 269}}</ref> However, the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, an offshoot of the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] at Caltech (GALCIT), filed two patent applications in Sep 1943 referencing Goddard's {{US patent|1102653}} for the multistage rocket.\n\nBy 1939, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's GALCIT had received Army Air Corps funding to develop rockets to assist in aircraft take-off. Goddard learned of this in 1940, and openly expressed his displeasure at not being considered.<ref name=\"Burrows\">{{cite book\n  |last=Burrows |first=William E.\n  |title=This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age\n  |year=1999 |publisher=Modern Library\n  | pages=89\u201392\n  |isbn=0-375-75485-7\n}}</ref> Malina could not understand why the Army did not arrange for an exchange of information between Goddard and Caltech since both were under government contract at the same time. Goddard did not think he could be of that much help to Caltech because they were designing rocket engines mainly with solid fuel, while he was using liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard was concerned with avoiding the public criticism and ridicule he had faced in the 1920s, which he believed had harmed his professional reputation. He also lacked interest in discussions with people who had less understanding of rocketry than he did,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|171}} feeling that his time was extremely constrained.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|23}} Goddard's health was frequently poor, as a result of his earlier bout of tuberculosis, and he was uncertain about how long he had to live<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|65,190}} He felt, therefore, that he hadn't the time to spare arguing with other scientists and the press about his new field of research, or helping all the amateur rocketeers who wrote to him.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61,71,110\u201311,114\u201315}} In 1932 Goddard wrote to H. G. Wells:\n<blockquote> How many more years I shall be able to work on the problem, I do not know; I hope, as long as I live. There can be no thought of finishing, for \"aiming at the stars\", both literally and figuratively, is a problem to occupy generations, so that no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.<ref name=Stoiko>{{cite book|last=Stoiko|first=Michael|title=Pioneers of Rocketry|year=1974|publisher=Hawthorn Books|location=New York|page=63}}</ref></blockquote>\nGoddard spoke to professional groups, published articles and papers and patented his ideas; but while he discussed basic principles, he was unwilling to reveal the details of his designs until he had flown rockets to high altitudes and thus proven his theory.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|115}} He tended to avoid any mention of space flight, and spoke only of high-altitude research, since he believed that other scientists regarded the subject as unscientific.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|116}} GALCIT saw Goddard's publicity problems and that the word \"rocket\" was \"of such bad repute\" that they used the word \"jet\" in the name of JPL and the related Aerojet Engineering Corporation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History Of Rocket Technology|editor-last=Emme|editor-first=Eugene E.|last1=Malina |first1=Frank J.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=Detroit|pages=52}}</ref>\n\nMany authors writing about Goddard mention his secrecy, but\nneglect the reasons for it. Some reasons have been noted above. Much of his work was for the military and was classified.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1541}} There were some in the U.S. before World War II that called for long-range rockets, and in 1939 Major James Randolph wrote a \"provocative article\" advocating a 3000-mile range missile. Goddard was \"annoyed\" by the unclassified paper as he thought the subject of weapons should be \"discussed in strict secrecy.\" <ref name=\"Don\">{{cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Don P.|title=Bossart: America's Forgotten Rocket Scientist|year=2016|publisher=Mental Landscape|location=San Bernardino, CA|pages=76}}</ref>\n\nHowever, Goddard's tendency to secrecy was not absolute, nor was he totally uncooperative. In 1945 GALCIT was building the [[WAC Corporal]] for the Army.  But in 1942 they were having trouble with their liquid propellant rocket engine's performance (timely, smooth ignition and explosions). Frank Malina went  to Annapolis in February and consulted with Goddard and Stiff, and they arrived at a solution to the problem (hypergolic propellant), which resulted in the successful launch of the high-altitude research rocket in October 1945.<ref name=\"Heinz\">{{cite book|last=Gartmann|first=Heinz|title=The Men Behind the Space Rockets|year=1955|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|pages=149}}</ref>\n\nDuring the First and Second World Wars, Goddard offered his services, patents, and technology to the military, and made some significant contributions. Just before the Second World War several young Army officers and a few higher-ranking ones believed Goddard's research was important but were unable to generate funds for his work.<ref name=\"Glenn\">{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/rgoddardsite/|title=Robert H.

With a curiosity about nature, he studied the heavens using a telescope from his father and observed the birds flying. Essentially a country boy, he loved the outdoors and hiking with his father on trips to Worcester and became an excellent marksman with a rifle.<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|63,64}} In 1898, his mother contracted tuberculosis and they moved back to Worcester for the clear air. On Sundays, the family attended the Episcopal church, and Robert sang in the choir.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|16}}\n\n===Childhood experiment===\nWith the [[electrification]] of American cities in the 1880s, the young Goddard became interested in science\u2014specifically, engineering and technology. When his father showed him how to generate static electricity on the family's carpet, the five-year-old's imagination was sparked.

He became a thorough diarist and documenter of his work\u2014a skill that would greatly benefit his later career. These interests merged at age 16, when Goddard attempted to construct a balloon out of [[aluminum]], shaping the raw metal in his home workshop, and filling it with hydrogen. After nearly five weeks of methodical, documented efforts, he finally abandoned the project, remarking, \"... balloon will not go up. ... Aluminum is too heavy. Failior {{sic}} crowns enterprise.\" However, the lesson of this failure did not restrain Goddard's growing determination and confidence in his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|21}} He wrote in 1927, \"I imagine an innate interest in mechanical things was inherited from a number of ancestors  who were machinists.\" <ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|7}}\n\n===Cherry tree dream===\nHe became interested in space when he read [[H.

The 17-year-old Goddard climbed a cherry tree to cut off dead limbs. He was transfixed by the sky, and his imagination grew. He later wrote:\n\n{{quote |On this day I climbed a tall cherry tree at the back of the barn ... and as I looked toward the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the ''possibility'' of ascending to Mars, and how it would look on a small scale, if sent up from the meadow at my feet. I have several photographs of the tree, taken since, with the little ladder I made to climb it, leaning against it.\nIt seemed to me then that a weight whirling around a horizontal shaft, moving more rapidly above than below, could furnish lift by virtue of the greater centrifugal force at the top of the path.\n\nI was a different boy when I descended the tree from when I ascended. Existence at last seemed very purposive.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|26}}<ref name=\"NASA Goddard\" >{{cite web\n  | url = http://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Sgoddard.htm\n  | title = Robert Goddard and His Rockets\n  | publisher = NASA}}</ref>}}\n\nFor the rest of his life, he observed October 19 as \"Anniversary Day\", a private commemoration of the day of his greatest inspiration.\n\n== Education and early studies ==\n\nThe young Goddard was a thin and frail boy, almost always in fragile health. He suffered from stomach problems, pleurisy, colds, and bronchitis, and he fell two years behind his classmates. He became a voracious reader, regularly visiting the local public library to borrow books on the physical sciences.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|16,19}}\n\n===Aerodynamics and motion===\n\nGoddard's interest in aerodynamics led him to study some of [[Samuel Langley]]'s scientific papers in the periodical ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]]''. In these papers, Langley wrote that birds flap their wings with different force on each side to turn in the air. Inspired by these articles, the teenage Goddard watched swallows and chimney swifts from the porch of his home, noting how subtly the birds moved their wings to control their flight. He noted how remarkably the birds controlled their flight with their tail feathers, which he called the birds' equivalent of [[ailerons]]. He took exception to some of Langley's conclusions and in 1901 wrote a letter to ''St. Nicholas'' magazine<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|5}} with his own ideas. The editor of  ''St. Nicholas'' declined to publish Goddard's letter, remarking that birds fly with a certain amount of intelligence and that \"machines will not act with such intelligence.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|31}} Goddard disagreed, believing that a man could control a flying machine with his own intelligence.\n\nAround this time, Goddard read [[Isaac Newton|Newton's]] ''[[Philosophi\u00e6 Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'', and found that [[Newton's laws of motion|Newton's Third Law of Motion]] applied to motion in space. He wrote later about his own tests of the Law:\n\n{{quote |I began to realize that there might be something after all to Newton's Laws. The Third Law was accordingly tested, both with devices suspended by rubber bands and by devices on floats, in the little brook back of the barn, and the said law was verified conclusively. It made me realize that if a way to navigate space were to be discovered, or invented, it would be the result of a knowledge of physics and mathematics.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}}}}\n\n===Academics===\nAs his health improved, Goddard continued his formal schooling as a 19-year-old sophomore at [[South High Community School]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm|title=Frequently Asked Questions \u2013 Dr. Robert H. Goddard Collection \u2013 Archives and Special Collections \u2013 Clark University|work=clarku.edu}}</ref> in Worcester in 1901. He excelled in his coursework, and his peers twice elected him class president. Making up for  lost time, he studied books on mathematics, astronomy, mechanics and composition from the school library.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|32}} At his graduation ceremony in 1904, he gave his class oration as [[valedictorian]]. In his speech, entitled \"On Taking Things for Granted\", Goddard included a section that would become emblematic of his life:\n\n<blockquote>[J]ust as in the sciences we have learned that we are too ignorant to safely pronounce anything impossible, so for the individual, since we cannot know just what are his limitations, we can hardly say with certainty that anything is necessarily within or beyond his grasp. Each must remember that no one can predict to what heights of wealth, fame, or usefulness he may rise until he has honestly endeavored, and he should derive courage from the fact that all sciences have been, at some time, in the same condition as he, and that it has often proved true that the dream of yesterday is the hope of today and the reality of tomorrow.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|19}}\n</blockquote>\n\nGoddard enrolled at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in 1904.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|41}} He quickly impressed the head of the physics department, A. Wilmer Duff, with his thirst for knowledge, and Duff took him on as a laboratory assistant and tutor.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|42}} At WPI, Goddard joined the [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]] fraternity and began a long courtship with high school classmate Miriam Olmstead, an honor student who had graduated with him as [[salutatorian]]. Eventually, she and Goddard were engaged, but they drifted apart and ended the engagement around 1909.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp |51}}\n\nGoddard received his [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] degree in physics from Worcester Polytechnic in 1908,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} and after serving there for a year as an instructor in physics, he began his graduate studies at [[Clark University]] in Worcester in the fall of 1909.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wpi.edu/academics/library/collections/rgoddard.html | publisher =WPI George C. Gordon Library | title = Robert Goddard |date= |accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> Goddard received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] degree in physics from Clark University in 1910, and then stayed at Clark to complete his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in physics in 1911. He spent another year at Clark as an honorary fellow in physics, and in 1912 he accepted a research fellowship at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Frist Campus Center|Palmer Physical Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|56\u201358}}\n\n===First scientific writings===\nThe high school student summed up his ideas on space travel in a proposed article, \"The Navigation of Space,\" which he submitted to the ''Popular Science News''. The journal's editor returned it, saying that they could not use it \"in the near future.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|34}}\n\nWhile still an undergraduate, Goddard wrote a paper proposing a method for balancing [[airplane]]s using gyro-stabilization. He submitted the idea to ''[[Scientific American]]'', which published the paper in 1907. Goddard later wrote in his diaries that he believed his paper was the first proposal of a way to automatically stabilize aircraft in flight.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|50}} His proposal came around the same time as other scientists were making breakthroughs in developing functional [[gyroscope]]s.\n\nWhile studying physics at WPI, ideas came to Goddard's mind that sometimes seemed impossible, but he was compelled to record them for future investigation. He wrote that \"there was something inside which simply would not stop working.\" He purchased some cloth-covered notebooks and began filling them with a variety of thoughts, mostly concerning his dream of space travel.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|11\u201313}} He considered centrifugal force, radio waves, magnetic reaction, solar energy, atomic energy, ion or electrostatic propulsion and other methods to reach space. After experimenting with solid fuel rockets he was convinced by 1909 that chemical-propellant engines were the answer.<ref name= \"Frank\" />{{rp|11\u201312}} A particularly complex concept was set down in June 1908: Sending a camera around distant planets, guided by measurements of gravity along the trajectory, and returning to earth.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|14}}\n\nHis first writing on the possibility of a liquid-fueled rocket came on February 2, 1909. Goddard had begun to study ways of increasing a rocket's efficiency using methods differing from conventional [[solid-fuel rocket]]s. He wrote in his notebook about using liquid hydrogen as a fuel with liquid oxygen as the oxidizer. He believed that 50 percent efficiency could be achieved with these liquid propellants (i.e., half of the heat energy of combustion converted to the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|55}}\n\n==First patents==\nIn the decades around 1910, radio was a new technology, fertile for innovation. In 1912, while working at Princeton University, Goddard investigated the effects of radio waves on insulators.<ref>Goddard, Robert H. \"On ponderomotive force upon a dielectric which carries a displacement current in a magnetic field\", ''[[Physical Review]]'', Vol. 6(2), pp. 99\u2013120 (August 1914).</ref> In order to generate radio-frequency power, he invented a vacuum tube with a beam deflection<ref>{{US patent|1159209}}</ref> that operated like a cathode-ray oscillator tube. His patent on this tube, which predated that of [[Lee De Forest]], became central in the suit between [[Arthur A. Collins]], whose small company made radio transmitter tubes, and [[AT&T]] and [[RCA]] over his use of [[vacuum tube]] technology.  Goddard accepted only a consultant's fee from Collins when the suit was dropped. Eventually the two big companies allowed the country's growing electronics industry to use the De Forest patents freely.<ref>McElroy, Gil, \"The Collins 45A \u2013 How Art Collins met Robert Goddard\", ''QST'', Vol. 81(2), pp. 44\u201346 (February 1997).</ref>\n\n===Rocket math===\nBy 1912 he had in his spare time, using calculus, developed the mathematics which allowed him to calculate the position and velocity of a rocket in vertical flight, given the weight of the rocket and weight of the propellant and the velocity (with respect to the rocket frame) of the exhaust gases. In effect he had independently developed the [[Tsiolkovsky rocket equation]] published a decade earlier in Russia. For vertical flight he included the effects of gravity and aerodynamic drag.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|136}}\n\nHis first goal was to build a [[Rocketsonde|sounding rocket]] with which to study the atmosphere. Not only would such investigation aid meteorology, but it was necessary to determine temperature, density and wind speed in order to design efficient space launch vehicles. He was very reluctant to admit that his ultimate goal was in fact to develop a vehicle for flights into space, since most scientists, especially in the United States, did not consider such a goal to be a realistic or practical scientific pursuit, nor was the public yet ready to seriously consider such ideas. Later, in 1933, Goddard said that \"[I]n no case must we allow ourselves to be deterred from the achievement of space travel, test by test and step by step, until one day we succeed, cost what it may.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|65,67,74,101}}\n\n===Fight to survive===\nIn early 1913, Goddard became seriously ill with [[tuberculosis]] and had to leave his position at Princeton. He then returned to Worcester, where he began a prolonged process of recovery at home. His doctors did not expect him to live. He decided he should spend time outside in the fresh air and walk for exercise, and he gradually improved.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61\u201364}} When his nurse discovered some of his notes in his bed, he kept them, arguing, \"I have to live to do this work.\"<ref name=\"Stoiko\" />{{rp|66}}\n\nIt was during this period of recuperation, however, that Goddard began to produce some of his most important work. As his symptoms subsided, he allowed himself to work an hour per day with his notes made at Princeton. He was afraid that nobody would be able to read his scribbling should he \nsuccumb.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|63}}\n\n===Foundational patents===\nIn the technological and manufacturing atmosphere of Worcester, [[patents]] were considered essential, not only to protect original work but as documentation of first discovery. He began to see the importance of his ideas as intellectual property, and thus began to secure those ideas before someone else did\u2014and he would have to pay to use them. In May 1913, he wrote descriptions concerning his first rocket patent applications. His father brought them to a patent lawyer in  Worcester who helped him to refine his ideas for consideration. Goddard's first patent application was submitted in October 1913.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|63\u201370}}\n\nIn 1914, his first two landmark patents were accepted and registered. The first, {{US patent|1102653}}, described a multi-stage rocket fueled with a solid \"explosive material.\" The second, {{US patent|1103503}}, described a rocket fueled with a [[solid fuel]] (explosive material) or with [[liquid propellant]]s (gasoline and liquid nitrous oxide). The two patents would eventually become important milestones in the history of rocketry.<ref name=\"Sea and Sky: Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.seasky.org/spacexp/sky5d1.html\n  | title = Space Exploration Timeline 1600\u20131960\n  | publisher = Sea and Sky}}</ref><ref name=\"Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\">{{cite web\n  | url =  http://www.russianspaceweb.com/chronology_XX.html\n  | title = Milestones of space exploration in the 20th century\n  | publisher = Russian Space Web}}</ref> Overall, 214 patents were published, some posthumously by his wife.\n\n== Early rocketry research ==\n[[File:Robert Goddard footage.ogv|thumb|right|Video clips of Goddard's launches and other events in his life]]\nIn the fall of 1914, Goddard's health had improved, and he accepted a part-time position as an instructor and research fellow at Clark University.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|73}} His position at Clark allowed him to further his rocketry research. He ordered numerous supplies that could be used to build rocket prototypes for launch and spent much of 1915 in preparation for his first tests. Goddard's first test launch of a powder rocket came on an early evening in 1915 following his daytime classes at Clark.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|74}} The launch was loud and bright enough to arouse the alarm of the campus janitor, and Goddard had to reassure him that his experiments, while being serious study, were also quite harmless. After this incident, Goddard took his experiments inside the physics lab, in order to limit any disturbance.\n\nAt the Clark physics lab, Goddard conducted static tests of powder rockets to measure their thrust and efficiency. He found his earlier estimates to be verified; powder rockets were converting only about two percent of the thermal energy in their fuel into thrust and kinetic energy. At this point he applied [[de Laval nozzle]]s, which were generally used with steam turbine engines, and these greatly improved efficiency. (Of the several definitions of rocket efficiency, Goddard measured in his laboratory what is today called the ''internal efficiency'' of the engine: the ratio of the kinetic energy of the exhaust gases to the available thermal energy of combustion, expressed as a percentage.)<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|130}} By mid-summer of 1915, Goddard had obtained an average efficiency of 40 percent with a nozzle exit velocity of {{nowrap|6728 feet (2051 meters) per second}}.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|75}} Connecting a combustion chamber full of gunpowder to various converging-diverging expansion (de Laval) nozzles, Goddard was able in static tests to achieve engine efficiencies of more than 63% and exhaust velocities of over 7000 feet (2134 meters) per second.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|78}}\n\nFew would recognize it at the time, but this little engine was a major breakthrough. These experiments suggested that rockets could be made powerful enough to escape Earth and travel into space. This engine and subsequent experiments sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution were the beginning of modern rocketry and, ultimately, space exploration.<ref name=\"Pendray\">{{cite book|last=Pendray|first=G.

Goddard responded with a detailed manuscript he had already prepared, entitled ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|79}}\n\nIn January 1917, the Smithsonian agreed to provide Goddard with a five-year grant totaling {{nowrap|US$5000}}.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|84}} Afterward, Clark was able to contribute {{nowrap|US$3500 }} and the use of their physics lab to the project.

Webster, the world-renowned head of Clark's physics department,  Goddard arranged for the Smithsonian to publish the paper,  ''A Method...,'' which documented his work.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nWhile at Clark University, Goddard did research into solar power using a parabolic dish to concentrate the Sun's rays on a machined piece of [[quartz]], that was sprayed with [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], which then heated water and drove an electric generator. Goddard believed his invention had overcome all the obstacles that had previously defeated other scientists and inventors, and he had his findings published in the November 1929 issue of  ''Popular Science''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FSgDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA22 \"A New Invention To Harness The Sun\"], ''Popular Science'', November 1929.</ref>\n\n===Goddard's military rocket===\nNot all of Goddard's early work was geared towards space travel. As the United States entered World War I in 1917, the country's universities began to lend their services to the war effort. Goddard believed his rocket research could be applied to many different military applications, including mobile artillery, field weapons and naval [[torpedo]]es. He made proposals to the Navy and Army. No record exists in his papers of any interest by the Navy to Goddard's inquiry. However, Army Ordnance was quite interested, and Goddard met several times with Army personnel.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89}}\n\nDuring this time, Goddard was also contacted, in early 1918, by a civilian industrialist in Worcester about the possibility of manufacturing rockets for the military. However, as the businessman's enthusiasm grew, so did Goddard's suspicion. Talks eventually broke down as Goddard began to fear his work might be appropriated by the business. However, an [[Army Signal Corps]] officer tried to make Goddard cooperate, but he was called off by General [[George Squier]] of the Signal Corps who had been contacted by Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, [[Charles Doolittle Walcott|Charles Walcott]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|89\u201391}} Goddard became leery of working with corporations and was careful to secure patents to \"protect his ideas.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|152}} These events led to the Signal Corps sponsoring Goddard's work during World War I.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|91}}\n\nGoddard proposed to the Army an idea for a tube-based rocket launcher as a light infantry weapon. The launcher concept became the precursor to the [[bazooka]].<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|92}} The rocket-powered, recoil-free weapon was the brainchild of Goddard as a side project (under Army contract) of his work on rocket propulsion. Goddard, during his [[tenure]] at [[Clark University]], and working at [[Mount Wilson Observatory]] for security reasons, designed the tube-fired rocket for military use during World War I. He and his co-worker, Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]] successfully demonstrated his rocket to the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|U.S. Army Signal Corps]] at [[Aberdeen Proving Ground]], [[Maryland]], on November 6, 1918, using two music stands for a launch platform. The Army was impressed, but the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Compi\u00e8gne Armistice]] was signed only five days later, and further development was discontinued as World War I ended.<ref name=\"NASA \u2013 Dr. Robert H.

Goddard, American Rocketry Pioneer\n  | publisher = NASA\n  | accessdate = 2010-05-04\n}}.</ref>\n\nThe delay in the development of the bazooka and other weapons was a result of the long recovery period required from Goddard's serious bout with tuberculosis. Goddard continued to be a part-time consultant to the U.S. Government at [[Indian Head, Maryland]],<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|121}} until 1923, but his focus had turned to other research involving rocket propulsion, including work with liquid fuels and liquid oxygen.\n\nLater, the former Clark University researcher Dr. [[Clarence N. Hickman]], and Army officers Col. [[Leslie Skinner]] and Lt. [[Edward Uhl]] continued Goddard's work on the bazooka. A [[shaped-charge]] warhead was attached to the rocket, leading to the tank-killing weapon used in World War II and to many other powerful rocket weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|305}}\n\n== ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes'' ==\n\nIn 1919 Goddard thought that it would be premature to disclose the results of his experiments because his engine was not sufficiently developed. Dr. Webster realized that Goddard had accomplished a good deal of fine work and insisted that Goddard publish his progress so far or he would take care of it himself, so Goddard asked the Smithsonian Institution if it would publish the report, updated with footnotes, that he had submitted in late 1916.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|102}}\n\nIn late 1919, the Smithsonian published Goddard's groundbreaking work, ''A Method of Reaching Extreme Altitudes''. The report describes Goddard's mathematical theories of rocket flight, his experiments with solid-fuel rockets, and the possibilities he saw of exploring Earth's atmosphere and beyond. Along with [[Konstantin Tsiolkovsky]]'s earlier work, ''The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices'',<ref name=\"Tsiolkovsky, Exploration of Cosmic Space\">{{cite book\n  |title=The Exploration of Cosmic Space by Means of Reaction Devices\n  |first=Konstantin |last=Tsiolkovsky\n  |authorlink=Konstantin Tsiolkovsky\n  |year=1903\n  |ref=Tsiolkovsky, Exploration of Cosmic Space\n}}</ref> which was not widely disseminated outside Russia,<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ley|first1=Willy|title=Events in Space|url=https://archive.org/details/eventsinspace0000leyw|url-access=registration|date=1969|publisher=David McKay Company|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/eventsinspace0000leyw/page/9 9]}}</ref> Goddard's report is regarded as one of the pioneering works of the science of rocketry, and 1750 copies were distributed worldwide.<ref name=\"Emme\">{{cite book|last=Emme|first=Eugene M.|title=A History of Spaceflight|year=1965|publisher=Holt, Rinehart and Winston|location=New York|page=90}}</ref> Goddard also sent a copy to individuals who requested one, until his personal supply was exhausted. Smithsonian aerospace historian Frank Winter said that this paper was \"one of the key catalysts behind the international rocket movement of the 1920s and 30s.\" <ref name= \"NYT\"/>\n\nGoddard described extensive experiments with solid-fuel [[rocket engine]]s burning high-grade nitrocellulose [[smokeless powder]].

Included as a [[thought experiment]] was the idea of launching a rocket to the Moon and igniting a mass of flash powder on its surface, so as to be visible through a telescope. He discussed the matter seriously, down to an estimate of the amount of powder required. Goddard's conclusion was that a rocket with starting mass of 3.21 tons could produce a flash \"just visible\" from Earth, assuming a final payload weight of 10.7 pounds.<ref name=\"Method\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Goddard|editor1-first=Esther C. |editor2-first=G.

He did, though, publish and talk about the rocket principle and [[sounding rockets]], since these subjects were not too \"far out.\" In a letter to the Smithsonian, dated March 1920, he discussed: photographing the Moon and planets from rocket-powered fly-by probes, sending messages to distant civilizations on inscribed metal plates, the use of solar energy in space, and the idea of high-velocity ion propulsion. In that same letter, Goddard clearly describes the concept of the [[Atmospheric reentry#Ablative|ablative heat shield]], suggesting the landing apparatus be covered with \"layers of a very infusible hard substance with layers of a poor heat conductor between\" designed to erode in the same way as the surface of a meteor.<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://siarchives.si.edu/history/exhibits/stories/march-1920-report-concerning-further-developments-space-travel\n|last=Goddard  |first=Robert H.\n  |title=Report Concerning Further Developments\n  |date=March 1920\n  |publisher=The Smithsonian Institution Archives\n}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote box |bgcolor=#F5F5F5 |salign=center |align=right |width=33% |quote=Every vision is a joke until the first man accomplishes it; once realized, it becomes commonplace.|source=&ndash;Response to a reporter's question following criticism in ''The New York Times'', 1920.<ref name=\"Clark University\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www2.clarku.edu/research/archives/goddard/faq.cfm#nyt\n|title=When was the famous New York Times editorial about Dr. Goddard?\n|publisher=Clark University\n|accessdate=2017-10-01}}</ref><ref name=\"NASA\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.nasa.gov/missions/research/f_goddard.html\n|title=Robert Goddard: A Man and His Rocket\n|publisher=NASA\n|accessdate=2010-05-08}}</ref>}}\n\n===Publicity and criticism===\nThe publication of Goddard's document gained him national attention from U.S. newspapers, most of it negative. Although Goddard's discussion of targeting the moon was only a small part of the work as a whole (eight lines on the next to last page of 69 pages), and was intended as an illustration of the possibilities rather than a declaration of intent, the papers sensationalized his ideas to the point of misrepresentation and ridicule. Even the Smithsonian had to abstain from publicity because of the amount of ridiculous correspondence received from the general public.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|113}} David Lasser, who co-founded the [[American Rocket Society]] (ARS), wrote in 1931 that Goddard was subjected in the press to the \"most violent attacks.\"<ref name=\"Lasser\">{{cite book|editor1-last=Lasser|editor1-first=David |editor2-first=Robert |editor2-last=Godwin |title=The Conquest of Space|year=2002|publisher=Apogee Books|location=Burlington, Ontario|isbn=1-896522-92-0|page=38}}</ref>\n\nOn January 12, 1920, a front-page story in ''[[The New York Times]]'', \"Believes Rocket Can Reach Moon\", reported a Smithsonian press release about a \"multiple-charge, high-efficiency rocket.\" The chief application envisaged was \"the possibility of sending recording apparatus to moderate and extreme altitudes within the Earth's atmosphere\", the advantage over balloon-carried instruments being ease of recovery, since \"the new rocket apparatus would go straight up and come straight down.\" But it also mentioned a proposal \"to [send] to the dark part of the new moon a sufficiently large amount of the most brilliant flash powder which, in being ignited on impact, would be plainly visible in a powerful telescope.

This work was his most important contribution to the quest to \"aim for the stars.\" <ref name= \"Gainor\" />{{rp|50}}\n\nGoddard worked alone with just his team of mechanics and machinists for many years.  This was a result of the harsh criticism from the media and other scientists, and his understanding of the military applications which foreign powers might use. Goddard became increasingly suspicious of others and often worked alone, except during the two World Wars, which limited the impact of much of his work. Another limiting factor was the lack of support from the American government, military and academia, all failing to understand the value of the rocket to study the atmosphere and near space, and for military applications. As Germany became ever more war-like, he refused to communicate with German rocket experimenters, though he received more and more of their correspondence.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|131}}\n\n===='A Correction'====\nForty-nine years after its editorial mocking Goddard, on July 17, 1969\u2014the day after the launch of [[Apollo 11]]\u2014''The New York Times'' published a short item under the headline \"A Correction.\" The three-paragraph statement summarized its 1920 editorial and concluded:\n<blockquote>Further investigation and experimentation have confirmed the findings of Isaac Newton in the 17th Century and it is now definitely established that a rocket can function in a vacuum as well as in an atmosphere. The Times regrets the error.<ref>''The New York Times'', July 17, 1969, p. 43,</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\n==First liquid-fueled flight==\n\nGoddard began considering liquid propellants, including hydrogen and oxygen, as early as 1909. He knew that hydrogen and oxygen was the most efficient fuel/oxidizer combination. Liquid hydrogen was not readily available in 1921, however, and he selected gasoline as the safest fuel to handle.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|13}}\n\n===First static tests===\n[[File:Goddard and Rocket.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Robert Goddard, bundled against the cold weather of March 16, 1926, holds the launching frame of his most notable invention \u2014 the first liquid-fueled rocket.]]\nGoddard began experimenting with liquid oxidizer, [[liquid fuel rocket]]s in September 1921, and successfully tested the first liquid propellant engine in November 1923.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|520}} It had a cylindrical [[combustion chamber]], using impinging jets to mix and atomize [[liquid oxygen]] and [[gasoline]].<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|499\u2013500}}\n\nIn 1924\u201325, Goddard had problems developing a high-pressure [[piston pump]] to send fuel to the combustion chamber. He wanted to scale up the experiments, but his funding would not allow such growth. He decided to forego the pumps and use a pressurized fuel feed system applying pressure to the fuel tank from a tank of [[inert gas]], a technique used today. The liquid oxygen, some of which evaporated,  provided its own pressure.\n\nOn December 6, 1925, he tested the simpler pressure feed system. He conducted a static test on the firing stand at the Clark University physics laboratory. The engine successfully lifted its own weight in a 27-second test in the static rack. It was a major success for Goddard, proving that a liquid fuel rocket was possible.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|140}} The test moved Goddard an important step closer to launching a rocket with liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard conducted an additional test in December, and two more in January 1926. After that, he began preparing for a possible launch of the rocket system.\n\n===First flight===\nGoddard launched the world's first liquid-fueled ([[bipropellant rocket|gasoline and liquid oxygen]]) rocket on March 16, 1926, in [[Auburn, Massachusetts]]. Present at the launch were his crew chief Henry Sachs, Esther Goddard, and Percy Roope, who was Clark's assistant professor in the physics department. Goddard's diary entry of the event was notable for its understatement:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 16. Went to Auburn with S[achs] in am. E[sther] and Mr. Roope came out at 1 p.m. Tried rocket at 2.30. It rose 41 feet & went 184 feet, in 2.5 secs., after the lower half of the nozzle burned off. Brought materials to lab. ...<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nHis diary entry the next day elaborated:\n<blockquote>\nMarch 17, 1926. The first flight with a rocket using liquid propellants was made yesterday at Aunt Effie's farm in Auburn. ... \nEven though the release was pulled, the rocket did not rise at first, but the flame came out, and there was a steady roar. After a number of seconds it rose, slowly until it cleared the frame, and then at express train speed, curving over to the left, and striking the ice and snow, still going at a rapid rate.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|143}}\n</blockquote>\n\nThe rocket, which was later dubbed \"Nell\", rose just 41&nbsp;feet during a 2.5-second flight that ended 184 feet away in a cabbage field,<ref>{{cite book|last=Streissguth|first=Thomas|title=Rocket man: the story of Robert Goddard|publisher=Twenty-First Century Books|year=1995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37 37]|isbn=0-87614-863-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/rocketmanstoryof00stre/page/37}}</ref> but it was an important demonstration that liquid fuels and oxidizers were possible propellants for larger rockets. The launch site is now a [[National Historic Landmark]], the [[Goddard Rocket Launching Site]].\n\nViewers familiar with more modern rocket designs may find it difficult to distinguish the rocket from its launching apparatus in the well-known picture of \"Nell\". The complete rocket is significantly taller than Goddard but does not include the pyramidal support structure which he is grasping. The rocket's [[combustion chamber]] is the small cylinder at the top; the [[nozzle]] is visible beneath it. The fuel tank, which is also part of the rocket, is the larger cylinder opposite Goddard's torso. The fuel tank is directly beneath the nozzle and is protected from the motor's exhaust by an [[asbestos]] cone. Asbestos-wrapped aluminum tubes connect the motor to the tanks, providing both support and fuel transport.<ref>[http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf NASA, ''Discover NASA and You''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527221503/http://dln.nasa.gov/media/storage/DNY9-12activities.pdf |date=2010-05-27 }}.</ref> This layout is no longer used, since the experiment showed that this was [[Pendulum rocket fallacy|no more stable]] than placing the combustion chamber and nozzle at the base. By May, after a series of modifications to simplify the plumbing, the combustion chamber and nozzle were placed in the now classic position, at the lower end of the rocket.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|259}}\n\nGoddard determined early that fins alone were not sufficient to stabilize the rocket in flight and keep it on the desired trajectory in the face of winds aloft and other disturbing forces. He added movable vanes in the exhaust, controlled by a gyroscope, to control and steer his rocket. (The Germans used this technique in their V-2.) He also introduced the more efficient swiveling engine in several rockets, basically the method used to steer large liquid-propellant missiles and launchers today.<ref name=\"Sutton\" />{{rp|263\u20136}}\n\n==Lindbergh and Goddard==\n\nAfter launch of one of Goddard's rockets in July 1929 again gained the attention of the newspapers,<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X9tbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wlINAAAAIBAJ&dq=rocket%20accident&pg=4275%2C2780242 \"Giant Rocket Alarms Many\"], ''St. Joseph, Missouri Gazette'', July 18, 1929.</ref> [[Charles Lindbergh]] learned of his work in a ''New York Times'' article. At the time, Lindbergh had begun to wonder what would become of [[aviation]] (even space flight) in the distant future and had settled on jet propulsion and rocket flight as a probable next step. After checking with the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and being assured that Goddard was a bona fide physicist and not a crackpot, he phoned Goddard in November 1929.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|141}} Professor Goddard met the aviator soon after in his office at Clark University.<ref name=\"lehm\">{{cite journal|last=Lehman|first=Milton|date=October 4, 1963|title=How Lindbergh Gave a Lift to Rocketry|journal=LIFE Magazine|volume=55|issue=14|pages=115\u2013127|issn=0024-3019|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uFIEAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA115|accessdate=15 Mar 2010}}</ref> Upon meeting Goddard, Lindbergh was immediately impressed by his research, and Goddard was similarly impressed by the flier's interest. He discussed his work openly with Lindbergh, forming an alliance that would last for the rest of his life. While having long since become reticent to share his ideas, Goddard showed complete openness with those few who shared his dream, and whom he felt he could trust.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBy late 1929, Goddard had been attracting additional notoriety with each rocket launch. He was finding it increasingly difficult to conduct his research without unwanted distractions. Lindbergh discussed finding additional financing for Goddard's work and lent his famous name to Goddard's work. In 1930 Lindbergh made several proposals to industry and private investors for funding, which proved all but impossible to find following the recent [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|U.S. stock market crash]] in October 1929.<ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\n===Guggenheim sponsorship===\nIn the spring of 1930, Lindbergh finally found an ally in the [[Guggenheim family]]. Financier [[Daniel Guggenheim]] agreed to fund Goddard's research over the next four years for a total of $100,000 (~${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|100000|1932|r=-5}}}} today). The Guggenheim family, especially [[Harry Frank Guggenheim|Harry Guggenheim]], would continue to support Goddard's work in the years to come. The Goddards soon moved to [[Roswell, New Mexico]] <ref name=\"lehm\" />\n\nBecause of the military potential of the rocket, Goddard, Lindbergh, Harry Guggenheim, the Smithsonian Institution and others tried in 1940, before the U.S. entered World War II, to convince the Army and Navy of its value. Goddard's services were offered, but there was no interest, initially. Two young, imaginative military officers eventually got the services to attempt to contract with Goddard just prior to the war. The Navy beat the Army to the punch and secured his services to build variable-thrust, liquid-fueled rocket engines for jet-assisted take-off (JATO) of aircraft.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|293\u2013297}} These rocket engines were the precursors to the larger throttlable rocket plane engines that helped launch the space age.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The X-Planes|last=Miller|first=Jay|publisher=Orion Books|year=1988|isbn=|location=New York|pages=43,128\u20139}}</ref>\n\nAstronaut [[Buzz Aldrin]] wrote that his father, Edwin Aldrin Sr. \"was an early supporter of Robert Goddard.\"  The elder Aldrin was a student of physics under Goddard at Clark, and worked with Lindbergh to obtain the help of the Guggenheims. Buzz believed that if Goddard had received military support as von Braun's team had in Germany, American rocket technology would have developed much more rapidly in World War II.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Men from Earth|last=Aldrin|first=Buzz|last2=McConnell|first2=Malcolm|publisher=Bantam Books|year=1989|isbn=0-553-05374-4|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/ xx,21]|url=https://archive.org/details/menfromearth0000aldr/page/}}</ref>\n\n===Lack of vision in the United States===\nBefore World War II there was a lack of vision and serious interest in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard's rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|719,746}} Between the World Wars, the [[Daniel and Florence Guggenheim Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]] was the main source of funding for Goddard's research.<ref name=\"Braun\" />{{rp|46,59,60}} Goddard's liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian [[Eugene Emme]], but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans.<ref name=\"Emme\" />{{rp|63}} Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he \"would not be surprised if the research would become something in the nature of a race,\" and he wondered how soon the European \"theorists\" would begin to build rockets.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|136}}\nIn 1936, the U.S. military attach\u00e9 in Berlin asked Charles Lindbergh to visit Germany and learn what he could of their progress in aviation. Although the Luftwaffe showed him their factories and were open concerning their growing airpower, they were silent on the subject of rocketry. When Lindbergh told Goddard of this behavior, Goddard said, \"Yes, they must have plans for the rocket. When will our own people in Washington listen to reason?\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|272}}\n\nMost of the U.S.'s largest universities were also slow to realize rocketry's potential. Just before World War II, the head of the aeronautics department at MIT, at a meeting held by the [[United States Army Air Corps|Army Air Corps]] to discuss project funding, said that the [[California Institute of Technology]] (Caltech) \"can take the Buck Rogers Job [rocket research].\"<ref name=\"Carter\">{{cite book|last=Carter|first=John|title=Sex and Rockets|year=1999|publisher=Feral House|location=Los Angeles|page=31}}</ref> In 1941, Goddard tried to recruit an engineer for his team from MIT but couldn't find one who was interested.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|326}}  There were some exceptions: MIT was at least teaching basic rocketry,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|264}} and Caltech had courses in rocketry and aerodynamics. After the war, Dr. Jerome Hunsaker of MIT, having studied Goddard's patents, stated that \"Every liquid-fuel rocket that flies is a Goddard rocket.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|363}}\n\nWhile away in Roswell, Goddard was still head of the physics department at Clark University, and Clark allowed him to devote most of his time to rocket research. Likewise, the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA) permitted astronomer [[Samuel Herrick (astronomer)|Samuel Herrick]] to pursue research in space vehicle guidance and control, and shortly after the war to teach courses in spacecraft guidance and orbit determination. Herrick began corresponding with Goddard in 1931 and asked if he should work in this new field, which he named [[astrodynamics]]. Herrick said that Goddard had the vision to advise and encourage him in his use of [[celestial mechanics]] \"to anticipate the basic problem of space navigation.\" Herrick's work contributed substantially to America's readiness to control flight of Earth satellites and send men to the Moon and back.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=vt/viblbv00753.xml|title=Samuel Herrick Papers 1930-1974|access-date=June 21, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Roswell, New Mexico==\n[[File:RobertHGoddardRocket TopDown.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles Lindbergh]] took this picture of Robert H.

He had consulted a meteorologist as to the best area to do his work, and Roswell seemed ideal. Here they would not endanger anyone, would not be bothered by the curious and would experience a more moderate climate (which was also better for Goddard's health).<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|177}} The locals valued personal privacy, knew Goddard desired his, and when travelers asked where Goddard's facilities were located, they would likely be misdirected.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|261}}\n\nBy September 1931, his rockets had the now familiar appearance of a smooth casing with tail-fins. He began experimenting with [[gyroscope|gyroscopic]] guidance and made a flight test of such a system in April 1932. A gyroscope mounted on gimbals electrically controlled steering vanes in the exhaust, similar to the system used by the German [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] over 10&nbsp;years later. Though the rocket crashed after a short ascent, the guidance system had worked, and Goddard considered the test a success.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|193\u20135}}\n\nA temporary loss of funding from the Guggenheims, as a result of the depression, forced Goddard in spring of 1932 to return to his much-loathed professorial responsibilities at Clark University.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clary |first1=David |title=Rocket Man |date=2003 |publisher=Hyperion |location=New York |isbn=978-0786887057 |pages=165\u2013166}}</ref> He remained at the university until the autumn of 1934, when funding resumed.<ref name=\"The Papers of Robert H.

Goddard\"/> Upon his return to Roswell, he began work on his A series of rockets, 4 to 4.5&nbsp;meters long, and powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen pressurized with nitrogen. The gyroscopic control system was housed in the middle of the rocket, between the propellant tanks.<ref name=\"RockDev\">{{cite book|last=Goddard|first=Robert and editors Esther C. Goddard and G. Edward Pendray|title=Rocket Development|year=1961|publisher=Prentice-Hall|location=New York}}</ref>{{rp|xv,15\u201346}}\n\nThe A-4 used a simpler pendulum system for guidance, as the gyroscopic system was being repaired. On March 8, 1935, it flew up to 1,000 feet, then turned into the wind and, Goddard reported, \"roared in a powerful descent across the prairie, at close to, or at, the speed of sound.\" On March 28, 1935, the A-5 successfully flew vertically to an altitude of (0.91&nbsp;mi; 4,800&nbsp;ft) using his gyroscopic guidance system. It then turned to a nearly horizontal path, flew 13,000 feet and achieved a maximum speed of 550 miles per hour. Goddard was elated because the guidance system kept the rocket on a vertical path so well.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|208}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|978\u20139}}\n\nIn 1936\u20131939, Goddard began work on the K and L series rockets, which were much more massive and designed to reach very high altitude. The K series consisted of static bench tests of a more powerful engine, achieving a thrust of 624&nbsp;lbs in February 1936.<ref name=\"Braun\">{{cite book|last=Von Braun|first=Wernher and Frederick I. Ordway III|title=History of Rocketry and Space Travel, revised Edition|year=1969|publisher=Thomas Y. Crowell Co.|location=New York|page=50}}</ref>  This work was plagued by trouble with chamber burn-through. In 1923, Goddard had built a regeneratively cooled engine, which circulated liquid oxygen around the outside of the combustion chamber, but he deemed the idea too complicated. He then used a curtain cooling method that involved spraying excess gasoline, which evaporated around the inside wall of the combustion chamber, but this scheme did not work well, and the larger rockets failed. Goddard returned to a smaller design, and his L-13 reached an altitude of 2.7 kilometers (1.7&nbsp;mi; 8,900&nbsp;ft), the highest of any of his rockets. Weight was reduced by using thin-walled fuel tanks wound with high-tensile-strength wire.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|71\u2013148}}\n\nGoddard experimented with many of the features of today's large rockets, such as multiple combustion chambers and nozzles. In November 1936, he flew the world's first rocket (L-7) with multiple chambers, hoping to increase thrust without increasing the size of a single chamber. It had four combustion chambers, reached a height of 200 feet, and corrected its vertical path using blast vanes until one chamber burned through. This flight demonstrated that a rocket with multiple combustion chambers could fly stably and be easily guided.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|96}} In July 1937 he replaced the guidance vanes with a movable tail section containing a single combustion chamber, as if on gimbals ([[thrust vectoring]]). The flight was of low altitude, but a large disturbance, probably caused by a change in the wind velocity, was corrected back to vertical. In an August test the flight path was corrected seven times by the movable tail and was captured on film by Mrs Goddard.<ref name= \"RockDev\" />{{rp|113\u2013116}}\n\nFrom 1940 to 1941, Goddard worked on the P series of rockets, which used propellant turbopumps (also powered by gasoline and liquid oxygen). The lightweight pumps produced higher propellant pressures, permitting a more powerful engine (greater thrust) and a lighter structure (lighter tanks and no pressurization tank), but two launches both ended in crashes after reaching an altitude of only a few hundred feet. The turbopumps worked well, however, and Goddard was pleased.<ref name=\"RockDev\" />{{rp|187\u2013215}}\n\nWhen Goddard mentioned the need for turbopumps, Harry Guggenheim suggested that he contact pump manufacturers to aid him. None were interested, as the development cost of these miniature pumps was prohibitive. Goddard's team was therefore left on its own and from September 1938 to June 1940 designed and tested the small turbopumps and gas generators to operate the turbines. Esther later said that the pump tests were \"the most trying and disheartening phase of the research.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274\u20135}}\n\nGoddard was able to flight-test many of his rockets, but many resulted in what the uninitiated would call failures, usually resulting from engine malfunction or loss of control. Goddard did not consider them failures, however, because he felt that he always learned something from a test.<ref name=\"Gainor\" />{{rp|45}} Most of his work involved static tests, which are a standard procedure today, before a flight test. He wrote to a correspondent:  \"It is not a simple matter to differentiate unsuccessful from successful experiments. ... [Most] work that is finally successful is the result of a series of unsuccessful tests in which difficulties are gradually eliminated.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|274}}\n\n===General Jimmy Doolittle===\n[[Jimmy Doolittle]] was introduced to the field of space science at an early point in its history. He recalls in his autobiography, \"I became interested in rocket development in the 1930s when I met Robert H. Goddard, who laid the foundation. ...

Doolittle flew himself to Roswell in October 1938 and was given a tour of Goddard's shop and a \"short course\" in rocketry.  He then wrote a memo, including a rather detailed description of Goddard's rocket. In closing he said, \"interplanetary transportation is probably a dream of the very distant future, but with the moon only a quarter of a million miles away\u2014who knows!\" In July 1941, he wrote Goddard that he was still interested in his rocket propulsion research. The Army was interested only in JATO at this point. However, Doolittle and Lindbergh were concerned about the state of rocketry in the US, and Doolittle remained in touch with Goddard.<ref name=Method/>{{rp|1208\u201316,1334,1443}}\n\nShortly after World War II, Doolittle spoke concerning Goddard to an [[American Rocket Society]] (ARS) conference at which a  large number interested in rocketry attended.

Simply reaching high altitudes was not his primary goal; he was trying, with a methodical approach, to perfect his liquid fuel engine and subsystems such as guidance and control so that his rocket could eventually achieve high altitudes without tumbling in the rare atmosphere, providing a stable vehicle for the experiments it would eventually carry. He had built the necessary turbopumps and was on the verge of building larger, lighter, more reliable rockets to reach extreme altitudes carrying scientific instruments when World War II intervened and changed the path of American history. He hoped to return to his experiments in Roswell after the war.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|206,230,330\u20131}}<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|923\u20134}}\n\nThough by the end of the Roswell years much of his technology had been replicated independently by others, he introduced new developments to rocketry that were used in this new enterprise: lightweight turbopumps, variable-thrust engine (in U.S.), engine with multiple combustion chambers and nozzles, and curtain cooling of combustion chamber.\n\nAlthough Goddard had brought his work in rocketry to the attention of the [[United States Army]], between World Wars, he was rebuffed, since the Army largely failed to grasp the military application of large rockets and said there was no money for new experimental weapons.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|297}} German military intelligence, by contrast, had paid attention to Goddard's work. The Goddards noticed that some mail had been opened, and some mailed reports had gone missing. An accredited [[military attach\u00e9]] to the US, Friedrich von Boetticher, sent a four-page report to the ''[[Abwehr]]'' in 1936, and the spy Gustav Guellich sent a mixture of facts and made-up information, claiming to have visited Roswell and witnessed a launch. The ''Abwehr'' was very interested and responded with more questions about Goddard's work.<ref>{{cite book\n  |first=David  |last=Kahn\n  |title=Hitler's Spies: German Military Intelligence in World War II\n  |publisher=Da Capo Press\n  |year=2000\n  |page=77\n  |isbn=0-02-052440-4\n}}</ref>{{rp|77}}<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|227\u20138}} Guellich's reports did include information about fuel mixtures and the important concept of fuel-curtain cooling,<ref>The Game of the Foxes, Ladislas Farago, 1972,</ref>{{rp|39\u201341}} but thereafter the Germans received very little information about Goddard.\n\nThe Soviet Union had a spy in the U.S. Navy Bureau of Aeronautics. In 1935, she gave them a report Goddard had written for the Navy in 1933. It contained results of tests and flights and suggestions for military uses of his rockets. The Soviets considered this to be very valuable information. It provided few design details, but gave them the direction and knowledge about Goddard's progress.<ref name=\"Haynes, Spies, 2009\">{{cite book\n  |last=Haynes  |first=J.E.\n  |last2=Klehr  |first2=H.\n  |last3=Vassiliev  |first3=A.\n  |title=Spies: The Rise and Fall of the KGB in America\n  |url=https://archive.org/details/spiesrisefallofk00john  |url-access=registration  |publisher=Yale University Press\n  |year=2009\n  |ref=Haynes, Spies, 2009\n  |isbn=978-0-300-12390-6\n}}</ref>{{rp|386\u20137}}\n\n== Annapolis, Maryland ==\nNavy Lieutenant Charles F. Fischer, who had visited Goddard in Roswell earlier and gained his confidence, believed Goddard was doing valuable work and was able to convince the Bureau of Aeronautics in September 1941 that Goddard could build the JATO unit the Navy desired. While still in Roswell, and before the Navy contract took effect, Goddard began in September to apply his technology to build a variable-thrust engine to be attached to a [[PBY]] seaplane. By May 1942, he had a unit that could meet the Navy's requirements and be able to launch a heavily loaded aircraft from a short runway. In February, he received part of a PBY with bullet holes apparently acquired in the [[Pearl Harbor]] attack. Goddard wrote to Guggenheim that \"I can think of nothing that would give me greater satisfaction than to have it contribute to the inevitable retaliation.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|322,328\u20139,331,335,337}}\n\nIn April, Fischer notified Goddard that the Navy wanted to do all its rocket work at the Engineering Experiment Station at Annapolis. Esther, worried that a move to the climate of Maryland would cause Robert's health to deteriorate faster, objected. But the patriotic Goddard replied, \"Esther, don't you know there's a war on?\" Fischer also questioned the move, as Goddard could work just as well in Roswell. Goddard simply answered, \"I was wondering when you would ask me.\" Fischer had wanted to offer him something bigger\u2014a long range missile\u2014but JATO was all he could manage, hoping for a greater project later.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|338,9}} It was a case of a square peg in a round hole, according to a disappointed Goddard.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|209}}\n\nGoddard and his team had already been in Annapolis a month and had tested his constant-thrust JATO engine when he received a Navy telegram, forwarded from Roswell, ordering him to Annapolis. Lt. Fischer asked for a crash effort. By August, his engine was producing 800&nbsp;lbs of thrust for 20 seconds, and Fischer was anxious to try it on a PBY. On the sixth test run, with all bugs worked out, the PBY, piloted by Fischer, was pushed into the air from the Severn River. Fischer landed and prepared to launch again. Goddard had wanted to check the unit, but radio contact with the PBY had been lost. On the seventh try, the engine caught fire. The plane was 150 feet up when flight was aborted. Because Goddard had installed a safety feature at the last minute, there was no explosion and no lives were lost. The problem's cause was traced to hasty installation and rough handling. Cheaper, safer solid fuel JATO engines were eventually selected by the armed forces. An engineer later said, \"Putting [Goddard's] rocket on a seaplane was like hitching an eagle to a plow.\"<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|344\u201350}}\n\nMilton Lehman notes:\n<blockquote>\nIn its 1942 crash effort to perfect an aircraft booster, the Navy was beginning to learn its way in rocketry. In similar efforts, the Army Air Corps was also exploring the field [with [[GALCIT]]]. Compared to Germany's massive program, these beginnings were small, yet essential to later progress. They helped develop a nucleus of trained American rocket engineers, the first of the new breed who would follow the professor into the Age of Space.<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|350}}\n</blockquote>\n\nIn August, 1943, President Atwood at Clark wrote to Goddard that the University was losing the acting head of the Physics Department, was taking on \"emergency work\" for the Army, and he was to \"report for duty or declare the position vacant.\" Goddard replied that he believed he was needed by he Navy, was nearing retirement age, and was unable to lecture because of his throat problem, which did not allow allow him to talk above a whisper. He regretfully resigned as Professor of Physics and expressed his deepest appreciation for all Atwood and the Trustees had done for him and indirectly for the war effort.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1509\u201311}} In June he had gone to see a throat specialist in Baltimore, who recommended that he not talk at all, to give his throat a rest.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1503}}\n  \nThe station, under Lt Commander Robert Truax, was developing another JATO engine in 1942 that used [[hypergolic propellant]]<nowiki/>s, eliminating the need for an ignition system. Chemist Ensign Ray Stiff had discovered in the literature in February that aniline and nitric acid burned fiercely immediately when mixed.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1488}}<ref name= \"Gruntman\" />{{rp|172}} Goddard's team built the pumps for the [[aniline]] fuel and the [[nitric acid]] oxidizer and participated in the static testing.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1520,1531}} The Navy delivered the pumps to [[Reaction Motors]] (RMI) to use in developing a gas generator for the pump turbines.

The team built a 3000-lb thrust engine using a cluster of four 750-lb thrust motors.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1574,1592}} They also developed 750-lb engines for the Navy's Gorgon guided interceptor missile (experimental [[Project Gorgon]]). Goddard continued to develop the variable-thrust engine with gasoline and lox because of the hazards involved with the hypergolics.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|1592}}<ref name= \"Lehman\" />{{rp|355,371}}\n\nDespite Goddard's efforts to convince the Navy that liquid-fueled rockets had greater potential, he said that the Navy had no interest in long-range missiles.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|1554}} However, the Navy asked him to perfect the throttleable JATO engine. Goddard made improvements to the engine, and in November it was demonstrated to the Navy and some officials from Washington. Fischer invited the spectators to operate the controls; the engine blasted out over the Severn at full throttle with no hesitation, idled, and roared again at various thrust levels. The test was perfect, exceeding the Navy's requirements. The unit was able to be stopped and restarted, and it produced a medium thrust of 600 pounds for 15 seconds and a full thrust of 1,000 pounds for over 15 seconds. A Navy Commander commented that \"It was like being Thor, playing with thunderbolts.\" Goddard had produced the essential propulsion control system of the rocket plane. The Goddards celebrated by attending the Army-Navy football game and attending the Fischers' cocktail party.<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|350\u20131}}\n\nThis engine was the basis of the Curtiss-Wright XLR25-CW-1 two-chamber, 15,000-pound variable-thrust engine that powered the [[Bell X-2]] research rocket plane. After World War II, Goddard's team and some patents went to [[Curtiss-Wright]] Corporation. \"Although his death in August 1945 prevented him from participating in the actual development of this engine, it was a direct descendent of his design.\"<ref name=\"Method\" />{{rp|1606}} Clark University and the Guggenheim Foundation received the royalties from the use of the patents.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/tag/curtiss-wright-xlr25-cw-1/page/2/|title=This Day In Aviation|last=Swopes|first=Began R.|date=2017|access-date=2 Sep 2019}}</ref>  In September 1956, the X-2 was the first plane to reach 126,000 feet altitude and in its last flight exceeded Mach 3 (3.2) before losing control and crashing.

Though the design details were not exactly the same, the basic design of the V-2 was similar to one of Goddard's rockets. The V-2, however, was technically far more advanced than the most successful of the rockets designed and tested by Goddard. The [[Peenem\u00fcnde Army Research Center|Peenem\u00fcnde rocket group]] led by [[Wernher von Braun]] may have benefited from the pre-1939 contacts to a limited extent,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|387\u20138}} but had also started from the work of their own space pioneer, [[Hermann Oberth]]; they also had the benefit of intensive state funding, large-scale production facilities (using slave labor), and repeated flight-testing that allowed them to refine their designs. Oberth was a theorist and had never built a rocket, but he tested small liquid propellant thrust chambers in 1929-30 which were not advancements in the \"state of the art.\"<ref name= \"Sutton\" />{{rp|273,275}} In 1922 Oberth asked Goddard for a copy of his 1919 paper and was sent one.<ref name= \"Clary\" />{{rp|96}}\n\nNevertheless, in 1963, von Braun, reflecting on the history of rocketry, said of Goddard: \"His rockets ... may have been rather crude by present-day standards, but they blazed the trail and incorporated many features used in our most modern rockets and space vehicles\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://history.msfc.nasa.gov/vonbraun/recollect-childhood.html |title=Recollections of Childhood/Early Experiences in Rocketry |publisher=History.msfc.nasa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-03-10}}</ref> He once recalled that \"Goddard's experiments in liquid fuel saved us years of work, and enabled us to perfect the V-2 years before it would have been possible.\"<ref name=\"Levine\">{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Alan J.|title=The Missile and Space Race|year=1994|publisher=Praeger Publishers|location=Westport, Connecticut|isbn=0-275-94451-4|page=3}}</ref> After  World War II von Braun reviewed Goddard's patents and believed they contained enough technical information to build a large missile.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Aldrin|first1=Buzz, Malcolm McConnel|title=Men From Earth|date=1989|publisher=Bantam Books|location=New York|page=21}}</ref>\n\nThree features developed by Goddard appeared in the V-2: (1) turbopumps were used to inject fuel into the combustion chamber; (2) gyroscopically controlled vanes in the nozzle stabilized the rocket until external vanes in the air could do so; and (3) excess alcohol was fed in around the combustion chamber walls, so that a blanket of evaporating gas protected the engine walls from the combustion heat.\n<ref>{{cite book\n  |last=Burchard |first=John E.

General [[Walter Dornberger]], head of the V-2 project, used the idea that they were in a race with the U.S. and that Goddard had \"disappeared\" (to work with the Navy) as a way to persuade Hitler to raise the priority of the V-2.\n\n== Goddard's secrecy ==\nGoddard avoided sharing details of his work with other scientists and preferred to work alone with his technicians. [[Frank Malina]], who was then studying rocketry at the [[California Institute of Technology]], visited Goddard in August 1936. Goddard hesitated to discuss any of his research, other than that which had already been published in ''Liquid-Propellant Rocket Development''. [[Theodore von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n]], Malina's mentor at the time, was unhappy with Goddard's attitude and later wrote, \"Naturally we at Caltech wanted as much information as we could get from Goddard for our mutual benefit. But Goddard believed in secrecy. ... The trouble with secrecy is that one can easily go in the wrong direction and never know it.\" <ref name=\"Burrows\" />{{rp|90}} However, at an earlier point, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n said that Malina was \"highly enthusiastic\" after his visit and that Caltech made changes to their liquid-propellant rocket, based on Goddard's work and patents. Malina remembered his visit as friendly and that he saw all but a few components in Goddard's shop.<ref name=\"Clary\" />{{rp|178}}\n\nGoddard's concerns about secrecy led to criticism for failure to cooperate with other scientists and engineers. His approach at that time was that independent development of his ideas without interference would bring quicker results even though he received less technical support. George Sutton, who became a rocket scientist working with von Braun's team in the late 1940s, said that he and his fellow workers had not heard of Goddard or his contributions and that they would have saved time if they had known the details of his work. Sutton admits that it may have been their fault for not looking for Goddard's patents and depending on the German team for knowledge and guidance; he wrote that information about the patents was not well distributed in the U.S. at that early period after World War II, though Germany and the Soviet Union had copies of some of them. (The Patent Office did not release rocket patents during World War II.)<ref name=\"Sutton\">{{cite book|last=Sutton|first=George P.|title=History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines|year=2006|publisher=American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|location=Reston, Virginia|pages=267, 269}}</ref> However, the Aerojet Engineering Corporation, an offshoot of the [[Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory]] at Caltech (GALCIT), filed two patent applications in Sep 1943 referencing Goddard's {{US patent|1102653}} for the multistage rocket.\n\nBy 1939, von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n's GALCIT had received Army Air Corps funding to develop rockets to assist in aircraft take-off. Goddard learned of this in 1940, and openly expressed his displeasure at not being considered.<ref name=\"Burrows\">{{cite book\n  |last=Burrows |first=William E.\n  |title=This New Ocean: The Story of the First Space Age\n  |year=1999 |publisher=Modern Library\n  | pages=89\u201392\n  |isbn=0-375-75485-7\n}}</ref> Malina could not understand why the Army did not arrange for an exchange of information between Goddard and Caltech since both were under government contract at the same time. Goddard did not think he could be of that much help to Caltech because they were designing rocket engines mainly with solid fuel, while he was using liquid fuel.\n\nGoddard was concerned with avoiding the public criticism and ridicule he had faced in the 1920s, which he believed had harmed his professional reputation. He also lacked interest in discussions with people who had less understanding of rocketry than he did,<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|171}} feeling that his time was extremely constrained.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|23}} Goddard's health was frequently poor, as a result of his earlier bout of tuberculosis, and he was uncertain about how long he had to live<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|65,190}} He felt, therefore, that he hadn't the time to spare arguing with other scientists and the press about his new field of research, or helping all the amateur rocketeers who wrote to him.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|61,71,110\u201311,114\u201315}} In 1932 Goddard wrote to H. G. Wells:\n<blockquote> How many more years I shall be able to work on the problem, I do not know; I hope, as long as I live. There can be no thought of finishing, for \"aiming at the stars\", both literally and figuratively, is a problem to occupy generations, so that no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.<ref name=Stoiko>{{cite book|last=Stoiko|first=Michael|title=Pioneers of Rocketry|year=1974|publisher=Hawthorn Books|location=New York|page=63}}</ref></blockquote>\nGoddard spoke to professional groups, published articles and papers and patented his ideas; but while he discussed basic principles, he was unwilling to reveal the details of his designs until he had flown rockets to high altitudes and thus proven his theory.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|115}} He tended to avoid any mention of space flight, and spoke only of high-altitude research, since he believed that other scientists regarded the subject as unscientific.<ref name=\"Lehman\" />{{rp|116}} GALCIT saw Goddard's publicity problems and that the word \"rocket\" was \"of such bad repute\" that they used the word \"jet\" in the name of JPL and the related Aerojet Engineering Corporation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The History Of Rocket Technology|editor-last=Emme|editor-first=Eugene E.|last1=Malina |first1=Frank J.|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1964|isbn=|location=Detroit|pages=52}}</ref>\n\nMany authors writing about Goddard mention his secrecy, but\nneglect the reasons for it. Some reasons have been noted above. Much of his work was for the military and was classified.<ref name= \"Method\" />{{rp|1541}} There were some in the U.S. before World War II that called for long-range rockets, and in 1939 Major James Randolph wrote a \"provocative article\" advocating a 3000-mile range missile.

In 1945 GALCIT was building the [[WAC Corporal]] for the Army.  But in 1942 they were having trouble with their liquid propellant rocket engine's performance (timely, smooth ignition and explosions). Frank Malina went  to Annapolis in February and consulted with Goddard and Stiff, and they arrived at a solution to the problem (hypergolic propellant), which resulted in the successful launch of the high-altitude research rocket in October 1945.<ref name=\"Heinz\">{{cite book|last=Gartmann|first=Heinz|title=The Men Behind the Space Rockets|year=1955|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London|pages=149}}</ref>\n\nDuring the First and Second World Wars, Goddard offered his services, patents, and technology to the military, and made some significant contributions.

The house is inhabited by tiny creatures called ''[[susuwatari]]''\u2014small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places.<ref group=note>The susuwatari are called \"black soots\" in early subtitles and \"soot sprites\" in the later English dubbed version.</ref> When the girls become comfortable in their new house, the soot spirits leave to find another empty house.\n\nOne day, Mei discovers two small spirits who lead her into the hollow of a large [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]]. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". She falls asleep atop Totoro, but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei is unable to show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her by telling her that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.{{Multiple image|align = right|image1 = Expo 2005 of Satsuki and Mei\u2019s House 01.jpg|caption1 = Satsuki and Mei's house ([[:ja:\u30b5\u30c4\u30ad\u3068\u30e1\u30a4\u306e\u5bb6]]) at the [[Expo 2005]] site.|image2 = Satsuki and Mei's House 01.JPG|caption2 = Closeup view of Satsuki and Mei's house|direction = vertical}}\n\nOne rainy night, the girls are waiting for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back, and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken for her father. Totoro is delighted and gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A [[catbus|giant, bus-shaped cat]] halts at the stop, and Totoro boards it and leaves. Shortly after, Tatsuo's bus arrives.\n\nThe girls plant the seeds. A few days later, they awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his colleagues engaged in a [[ceremonial dance]] around the planted seeds. The girls join in and the seeds grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying [[top]]. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have indeed sprouted; it is left unclear whether the girls were dreaming.\n\nThe girls find out that a planned visit by Yasuko has to be postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei does not take this well and argues with Satsuki, later leaving for the hospital to bring fresh corn to Yasuko. Her disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her. In desperation, Satsuki returns to the [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]] and pleads for Totoro's help. Delighted to help, he summons the Catbus, which carries her to where the lost Mei sits. The bus then whisks them over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital. The girls overhear a conversation between their parents and discover that she has been kept in hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise doing well. They secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where it is discovered by their parents, and return home.\n\nEventually, Mei and Satsuki's mother returns home, and the sisters play with other children, while Totoro and his friends watch them from afar.\n\n==Paola Cant\u00fa ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The director challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga's experience with ''My Neighbor Totoro'' jump-started the artist's career. Oga and Miyazaki debated the palette of the film, Oga seeking to paint black soil from [[Akita Prefecture]] and Miyazaki preferring the color of red soil from the [[Kant\u014d region]].<ref name=art />{{rp|82}} The ultimate product was described by [[Studio Ghibli]] producer Toshio Suzuki: \"It was nature painted with translucent colors.\"<ref>{{cite news | first=Yoshiaki | last=Kikuchi | title=Totoro's set decorator | work=Daily Yomiuri | date=August 4, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nOga's conscientious approach to ''My Neighbor Totoro'' was a style that the ''International Herald Tribune'' recognized as \"[updating] the traditional Japanese animist sense of a natural world that is fully, spiritually alive\". The newspaper described the final product:\n{{quote|Set in a period that is both modern and nostalgic, the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity. A great part of this sense comes from Oga's evocative backgrounds, which give each tree, hedge and twist in the road an indefinable feeling of warmth that seems ready to spring into sentient life.<ref name=paper />}}\nOga's work on ''My Neighbor Totoro'' led to his continued involvement with Studio Ghibli.

The dual billing was considered \"one of the most moving and remarkable double bills ever offered to a cinema audience\".<ref name=\"mccarthy\">{{cite book | first=Helen | last=McCarthy | title=Hayao Miyazaki: Master of Japanese Animation | publisher=Stone Bridge Press | year=1999 | isbn=978-1-880656-41-9 | pages=43,120\u2013121 }}</ref>\n\n===Box office===\nIn Japan, ''My Neighbor Totoro'' sold 801,680 tickets and earned a distribution income of {{JPY|588 million}} in 1988.

Due to his disappointment with the result of the heavily edited English version of ''Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind'', Miyazaki would not permit any part of the movie to be edited out, all the names had to remain the same (with the exception being Catbus), the translation had to be as close to the original Japanese as possible, and no part of the movie could be changed for any reason, cultural or linguistic (which was very common at the time) despite creating problems with some English viewers, particularly in explaining the origin of the name \"Totoro\". It was produced by [[John Daly (producer)|John Daly]] and Derek Gibson, with co-producer [[Jerry Beck]]. In April 1993, [[Troma Entertainment|Troma Films]], under their 50th St. Films banner, distributed the dub of the film as a theatrical release, and was later released onto VHS by [[20th Century Fox Home Entertainment|Fox Video]].\n\nIn 2004, [[Disney]] produced an all new English dub of the movie to be released after the rights to the Streamline dub had expired. As is the case with Disney's other English dubs of Miyazaki films, the Disney version of ''Totoro'' features a star-heavy cast, including [[Dakota Fanning|Dakota]] and [[Elle Fanning]] as Satsuki and Mei, [[Timothy Daly]] as Mr. Kusakabe, [[Pat Carroll (actress)|Pat Carroll]] as Granny, [[Lea Salonga]] as Mrs. Kusakabe, and [[Frank Welker]] as Totoro and [[Catbus]].

Disney would later release the film on [[Blu-ray]] in the country on July 18, 2012.

The house is inhabited by tiny creatures called ''[[susuwatari]]''\u2014small, dark, dust-like house spirits seen when moving from light to dark places.<ref group=note>The susuwatari are called \"black soots\" in early subtitles and \"soot sprites\" in the later English dubbed version.</ref> When the girls become comfortable in their new house, the soot spirits leave to find another empty house.\n\nOne day, Mei discovers two small spirits who lead her into the hollow of a large [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]]. She befriends a larger spirit, which identifies itself by a series of roars that she interprets as \"Totoro\". She falls asleep atop Totoro, but when Satsuki finds her, she is on the ground. Despite many attempts, Mei is unable to show her family Totoro's tree. Tatsuo comforts her by telling her that Totoro will reveal himself when he wants to.{{Multiple image|align = right|image1 = Expo 2005 of Satsuki and Mei\u2019s House 01.jpg|caption1 = Satsuki and Mei's house ([[:ja:\u30b5\u30c4\u30ad\u3068\u30e1\u30a4\u306e\u5bb6]]) at the [[Expo 2005]] site.|image2 = Satsuki and Mei's House 01.JPG|caption2 = Closeup view of Satsuki and Mei's house|direction = vertical}}\n\nOne rainy night, the girls are waiting for Tatsuo's bus, which is late. Mei falls asleep on Satsuki's back, and Totoro appears beside them, allowing Satsuki to see him for the first time. Totoro has only a leaf on his head for protection against the rain, so Satsuki offers him the umbrella she had taken for her father. Totoro is delighted and gives her a bundle of nuts and seeds in return. A [[catbus|giant, bus-shaped cat]] halts at the stop, and Totoro boards it and leaves. Shortly after, Tatsuo's bus arrives.\n\nThe girls plant the seeds. A few days later, they awaken at midnight to find Totoro and his colleagues engaged in a [[ceremonial dance]] around the planted seeds. The girls join in and the seeds grow into an enormous tree. Totoro takes the girls for a ride on a magical flying [[top]]. In the morning, the tree is gone but the seeds have indeed sprouted; it is left unclear whether the girls were dreaming.\n\nThe girls find out that a planned visit by Yasuko has to be postponed because of a setback in her treatment. Mei does not take this well and argues with Satsuki, later leaving for the hospital to bring fresh corn to Yasuko. Her disappearance prompts Satsuki and the neighbors to search for her. In desperation, Satsuki returns to the [[Cinnamomum camphora|camphor tree]] and pleads for Totoro's help. Delighted to help, he summons the Catbus, which carries her to where the lost Mei sits. The bus then whisks them over the countryside to see Yasuko in the hospital. The girls overhear a conversation between their parents and discover that she has been kept in hospital by a minor cold but is otherwise doing well. They secretly leave the ear of corn on the windowsill, where it is discovered by their parents, and return home.\n\nEventually, Mei and Satsuki's mother returns home, and the sisters play with other children, while Totoro and his friends watch them from afar.\n\n==Cast==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The director challenged Oga to raise his standards, and Oga's experience with ''My Neighbor Totoro'' jump-started the artist's career.

The newspaper described the final product:\n{{quote|Set in a period that is both modern and nostalgic, the film creates a fantastic, yet strangely believable universe of supernatural creatures coexisting with modernity.

Disney would later release the film on [[Blu-ray]] in the country on July 18, 2012.

This implies a commitment to the worship of the Hellenic gods and action to back this up.\n\nThere is no central \"ecclesia\" (church/assembly) or hierarchical clergy, though some groups (i.e., Hellenion) do offer training in that capacity. Individual worshipers are generally expected to perform their own rituals and learn about the religion and the gods by reference to [[Primary source|primary]] and [[secondary sources]] on ancient Greek religion and through the personal experience of the gods. The information gained from such personal experiences is often referred to in Hellenic groups as \"UPG\" (Unverified Personal Gnosis), a term borrowed from [[\u00c1satr\u00fa]], though now commonly used among many pagan religions.\n\n== Relationship to ancient Greek religion ==\n{{further|Polytheistic reconstructionism}}\nThe majority of modern historians agree that the religion practiced by the ancient Greeks had been extinguished by the 9th century AD at the latest and that there is little to no evidence that any of its traditions or beliefs survived past the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=survival_greece>Gregory, T. (1986). The Survival of Paganism in Christian Greece: A Critical Essay. ''The American Journal of Philology'', '''107'''(2), 229-242. doi:10.2307/294605</ref> The majority of modern Hellenic polytheist organizations view their religious traditions as either \"revivalist\" or \"[[Polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructionist]]\", though most modern individual adherents exist somewhere on a Reconstructionist to Revivalist spectrum.\n\nRevivalists view Hellenic Polytheism as a living, changing religion. Hellenic Revivalism allows room for practitioners to decide what feels right to them, and to adapt historical religious practices to modern life.\n\n[[Polytheistic Reconstructionism|Reconstructionism]] is a methodology that attempts to accurately base modern religious practice on culturally and historically genuine examples of ancient religious practices. The term is frequently used in the United States to differentiate between [[syncretism|syncretic]] and [[eclecticism|eclectic]] [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] movements, and those based on the [[traditions]], writings, history, and [[mythology]] of a specific ancient polytheistic culture. In contrast to revivalist traditions, Reconstructionists are culturally oriented and attempt to reconstruct historical forms of religion and spirituality, in a modern context. Therefore, [[Kemetic reconstructionism|Kemetic]], Canaanite, Hellenic, [[Roman polytheistic reconstructionism|Roman]], [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic]], [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic]], [[Baltic neopaganism|Baltic]] and [[Slavic neopaganism|Slavic]] Reconstructionists aim for the revival of historical practices and beliefs of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egypt]], Ancient [[Canaanite religion|Canaan]] and Phoenicia, [[Religion in ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Celtic polytheism|Celts]], the [[Germanic Paganism|Germanic peoples]], the [[Baltic mythology|Balts]] and the [[Slavic mythology|Slavs]], respectively.\n\nMost Hellenic polytheist groups unequivocally state that reconstructionism is not the only correct method of practicing the ancient Greek religion, but do identify a practice as Hellenic only when it embraces the [[humanistic]] values and ethical virtues of the ancient Greeks, demonstrates loyalty and reverence toward the Greek Gods, and uses a religious structure that would be recognizable to an ancient Greek.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frequently asked questions about the Ethnic Hellenic religion and tradition: What do you think you will achieve by returning to the Ancient Ways in today's society? |work=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes |url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&f=faq#4 |accessdate=September 9, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=On Orthopraxy |work=Hellenismos.us|url=http://hellenismos.us/?p=124  |accessdate=September 9, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hellenic Ethics:Living Virtues in Community |work=The Cauldron: A Pagan Forum |url=http://www.ecauldron.com/greekethics.php |accessdate=September 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920112549/http://www.ecauldron.com/greekethics.php |archivedate=September 20, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The centrality of ethics in Dodekathiesm |work=Elaion |url=http://www.elaion.org/ethics.htm |accessdate=September 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120122509/http://www.elaion.org/ethics.htm |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}</ref> These groups make a clear distinction between themselves and the Neopagan movement, and identify some 'Hellenic' groups as \"simply disguised as 'Hellenes' for reasons that exist hidden within the depths of their own minds.\" <ref>{{cite web |title=Wojciech Jan Rudny interviews a constitutional member of the Supreme Council of the Ethnikoi Hellenes (YSEE) on behalf of the polish \"GNIAZDO\" magazine |work=YSEE |url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&f=rozmowa_en |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nSome adherents, like Greek ''Dodecatheon'' member Panagiotis Marinis, have claimed that the religion of ancient Greece actually survived throughout the intervening centuries, and some claim they were raised in families that practiced this religion.<ref>{{cite video|people=Jamil Said| title=I Still Worship Zeus|medium=DVD|publisher=Jamil Said Productions|date=2004}}</ref> Whether or not they believe that the Hellenic polytheist religious tradition is continuous, there is evidence that Greek Hellenic polytheists living in modern Greece see the movement as an expression of Greek cultural heritage in opposition to the dominant [[Church of Greece|Orthodox Christianity]].<ref>The periodic revival of aspects of the religion, such as in the arts, philosophy & etc is also an expression of a general European fascination with classicism & Hellenism.

The English author [[John Fransham]] (1730\u20131810) was one example, considered an eccentric by his peers, who was also referred to as a pagan and a polytheist. In Fransham's 1769 book ''The Oestrum of Orpheus'', he advanced a theology similar to that of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]]: that the first cause of existence is uncreated and indestructible, but not intelligent, and that the universe is shaped by \"innumerable intelligent powers or forces, 'plastic and designing,' who ruled all sublunary affairs, and may most fitly be designated by the nomenclature of the Hellenic theology.\"<ref name=survival/> Despite his apparent belief in the Hellenic gods, Fransham does not seem to have been particularly devoted to their worship. According to an 1875 profile in ''Fraser's Magazine'', Franshem's \"libations to the [[Penates]] found their way down his own throat, and when he sacrificed a fowl to [[Asclepius|'Esculapius]] it was usually in the form of chicken-broth for his supper.\"<ref name=survival/>\n\nAnother example of an 18th-century literary figure who may have considered himself a Hellenist was [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] (1758\u20131835), who produced the first English translations of many neoplatonic philosophical and religious texts. Taylor was widely known as the \"English Platonist\", and rumors existed that he had produced anonymous pamphlets advocating a return to a sort of pagan religion (these rumors have been debunked by modern scholars<ref>Addey, Tim. [http://www.prometheustrust.co.uk/Why_Thomas_Taylor_is_not_the_author_of_A_New_System_of_Religion.pdf Why Thomas Taylor is not the author of ''A New System of Religion'']. Prometheus Trust.</ref>). Though the extent of his actual devotion to Ancient Greek spirituality remains unknown, brief descriptions written by others about him tend to portray him as a sincerely devout polytheist.<ref name=survival/> One such sketch, written by [[Isaac D'Israeli]], describes Taylor delaying answering his door until he has finished his mid-day hymn to Apollo, and reports that his study contained a hanging globe of clear glass, representing Zeus, that scattered sunbeams he would use to read and write, shifting his position in the room to follow them throughout the day.<ref name=survival/>\n\nHis work inspired a limited number devotees.<ref name=survival>\"The Survival of Paganism\".

In 1788, Valadi traveled to England in order to convince an unnamed \"gentleman of eminence in the literary world\" to become the head of a new Pythagorean sect, assuring him that Valadi would help him find numerous followers.<ref name=valadi>\"Modern Platonism\".

Valadi began his studies at Glasgow, where he learned of Taylor, to whom he wrote in a letter:\n\n:\"''My determination was to go and live in North America, and there to keep a school of temperance and love, in order to preserve so many men from the prevailing vices of brutal intemperance and selfish cupidity ... There I would devoutly erect altars to my favourite Gods: Dioscuri, Hector, Aristomenes, Pan, Orpheus, Epaminondas, Pythagoras, Pluto, Timoleon, Marcus Brutus and his Portia, and above all, [[Helios|Phoebus]], the God of my hero [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] ...''\"<ref name=survival/>\n\nValadi paid Taylor to live in his house and study under him, but his tenure as Taylor's disciple was short lived. He returned to France to fight in the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 (he reportedly said, \"I came over Diogenes. I am going back Alexander.\"), and was executed by guillotine in December 1793.<ref name=valadi/>\n\n===20th century===\nIn the early 20th century, several [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] groups were formed, often incorporating elements of ancient Greek religion and honoring Greek gods, but with heavily syncretic elements drawn from Hermeticism and 19th century folklore studies. Most prominent of these modern traditions are [[Thelema]] and [[Wicca]], though [[Feraferia]] (an American tradition founded in the 1970s by Fred Adams) places heavier emphasis on a more Hellenistic style of worship and on the Greaco-Roman pantheon of gods.<ref>http://feraferia.org</ref> One Wiccan organization in the United States, the [[Aquarian Tabernacle Church]], began to host a spring festival based on the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] in 1985, which has continued to be held every year through the present day.<ref>[https://wildhunt.org/2019/03/aquarian-tabernacle-church-names-new-arch-priest.html Aquarian Tabernacle Church names new Arch Priest].</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, some began to reject the influence of Hermeticism and other heavily syncretic forms of Greek religion in preference of practices reconstructing earlier or more original forms of Hellenic worship. Early revivalists of Hellenic religion tended to be individuals working alone, and early attempts to organize adherents into larger groups failed. The first successful revival attempt was made by the [[Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes]] (or YSEE). In 1993, a variety of adherents to the Hellenic religion in Greece and elsewhere came together and began the process of organization. This resulted in a \"Hellenic National Assembly\", initiated at a gathering in southern Olympus on the 9th of September 1995. The process culminated with the formal establishment of the [[Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes|YSEE]] as a [[nonprofit organization|non-profit]] in Greece, in June 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ysee.gr/about.html |title=Who We Are and What We Want |publisher=Ysee.gr |date= |accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref>\n\n===21st century and official recognition===\n'''2004 Olympics controversy'''\n\nThe [[2004 Summer Olympics]] stirred up several disputes concerning Hellenic polytheistic religion.\n* Professor Giorgos Dontas, president of the [[Archaeological Society of Athens]] expressed public outrage at the destruction of ancient archaeological sites{{which|date=June 2016}} around the [[Parthenon]] and [[Acropolis]] in preparation for the Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/15/internationaleducationnews.artsnews|title=Drills and axes ravage ancient Greek site|author=Helena Smith|date=15 July 2002|website=theguardian.com|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=7 May 2015}}</ref>\n* Prior to the Olympic Games, [[MSNBC]] correspondent Rehema Ellis in a story called ''It's Greek to Me: Group Tries to Restore Pagan Worship'' documented the vandalism and arson of a bookstore in Athens which sold books promoting ancient Greek religion.

It was the first such rite performed at the temple since the ancient Greek religion was outlawed by the Roman government in the late 4th century.<ref>Associated Press, Zeus Worshippers Demand Access to Temple. ''The New York Times'', January 19, 2007</ref> The ceremony involved participants dressed as ancient warriors who left their swords and spears outside the sacred site, in order to represent the laying down of arms before the Olympic games. The BBC referred to the event as a show of \"intentional publicity\". The event caught the attention of the Greek Orthodox Church. Reporters at the event suggested the church might step up their opposition to the legitimizing of Hellenism. Father Eustathios Kollas, who presided over a community of Greek Orthodox priests, said: ''\"They are a handful of miserable resuscitators of a degenerate dead religion who wish to return to the monstrous dark delusions of the past.\"''<ref name=\"Ancient Greek gods' new believers\">Ancient Greek gods' new believers.

This implies a commitment to the worship of the Hellenic gods and action to back this up.\n\nThere is no central \"ecclesia\" (church/assembly) or hierarchical clergy, though some groups (i.e., Hellenion) do offer training in that capacity. Individual worshipers are generally expected to perform their own rituals and learn about the religion and the gods by reference to [[Primary source|primary]] and [[secondary sources]] on ancient Greek religion and through the personal experience of the gods. The information gained from such personal experiences is often referred to in Hellenic groups as \"UPG\" (Unverified Personal Gnosis), a term borrowed from [[\u00c1satr\u00fa]],, though now commonly used among many pagan religions.\n\n== Relationship to ancient Greek religion ==\n{{further|Polytheistic reconstructionism}}\nThe majority of modern historians agree that the religion practiced by the ancient Greeks had been extinguished by the 9th century AD at the latest and that there is little to no evidence that any of its traditions or beliefs survived past the [[Middle Ages]].<ref name=survival_greece>Gregory, T. (1986). The Survival of Paganism in Christian Greece: A Critical Essay. ''The American Journal of Philology'', '''107'''(2), 229-242. doi:10.2307/294605</ref> The majority of modern Hellenic polytheist organizations view their religious traditions as either \"revivalist\" or \"[[Polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructionist]]\", though most modern individual adherents exist somewhere on a Reconstructionist to Revivalist spectrum.\n\nRevivalists view Hellenic Polytheism as a living, changing religion. Hellenic Revivalism allows room for practitioners to decide what feels right to them, and to adapt historical religious practices to modern life.\n\n[[Polytheistic Reconstructionism|Reconstructionism]] is a methodology that attempts to accurately base modern religious practice on culturally and historically genuine examples of ancient religious practices. The term is frequently used in the United States to differentiate between [[syncretism|syncretic]] and [[eclecticism|eclectic]] [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] movements, and those based on the [[traditions]], writings, history, and [[mythology]] of a specific ancient polytheistic culture. In contrast to revivalist traditions, Reconstructionists are culturally oriented and attempt to reconstruct historical forms of religion and spirituality, in a modern context. Therefore, [[Kemetic reconstructionism|Kemetic]], Canaanite, Hellenic, [[Roman polytheistic reconstructionism|Roman]], [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic]], [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic]], [[Baltic neopaganism|Baltic]] and [[Slavic neopaganism|Slavic]] Reconstructionists aim for the revival of historical practices and beliefs of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Ancient Egypt]], Ancient [[Canaanite religion|Canaan]] and Phoenicia, [[Religion in ancient Greece|Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], the [[Celtic polytheism|Celts]], the [[Germanic Paganism|Germanic peoples]], the [[Baltic mythology|Balts]] and the [[Slavic mythology|Slavs]], respectively.\n\nMost Hellenic polytheist groups unequivocally state that reconstructionism is not the only correct method of practicing the ancient Greek religion, but do identify a practice as Hellenic only when it embraces the [[humanistic]] values and ethical virtues of the ancient Greeks, demonstrates loyalty and reverence toward the Greek Gods, and uses a religious structure that would be recognizable to an ancient Greek.<ref>{{cite web |title=Frequently asked questions about the Ethnic Hellenic religion and tradition: What do you think you will achieve by returning to the Ancient Ways in today's society? |work=Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes |url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&f=faq#4 |accessdate=September 9, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=On Orthopraxy |work=Hellenismos.us|url=http://hellenismos.us/?p=124  |accessdate=September 9, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Hellenic Ethics:Living Virtues in Community |work=The Cauldron: A Pagan Forum |url=http://www.ecauldron.com/greekethics.php |accessdate=September 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920112549/http://www.ecauldron.com/greekethics.php |archivedate=September 20, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The centrality of ethics in Dodekathiesm |work=Elaion |url=http://www.elaion.org/ethics.htm |accessdate=September 9, 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120122509/http://www.elaion.org/ethics.htm |archivedate=November 20, 2008 }}</ref> These groups make a clear distinction between themselves and the Neopagan movement, and identify some 'Hellenic' groups as \"simply disguised as 'Hellenes' for reasons that exist hidden within the depths of their own minds.\" <ref>{{cite web |title=Wojciech Jan Rudny interviews a constitutional member of the Supreme Council of the Ethnikoi Hellenes (YSEE) on behalf of the polish \"GNIAZDO\" magazine |work=YSEE |url=http://www.ysee.gr/index-eng.php?type=english&f=rozmowa_en |accessdate=September 26, 2010 }}</ref>\n\nSome adherents, like Greek ''Dodecatheon'' member Panagiotis Marinis, have claimed that the religion of ancient Greece actually survived throughout the intervening centuries, and some claim they were raised in families that practiced this religion.<ref>{{cite video|people=Jamil Said| title=I Still Worship Zeus|medium=DVD|publisher=Jamil Said Productions|date=2004}}</ref> Whether or not they believe that the Hellenic polytheist religious tradition is continuous, there is evidence that Greek Hellenic polytheists living in modern Greece see the movement as an expression of Greek cultural heritage in opposition to the dominant [[Church of Greece|Orthodox Christianity]].<ref>The periodic revival of aspects of the religion, such as in the arts, philosophy & etc is also an expression of a general European fascination with classicism & Hellenism.

The English author [[John Fransham]] (1730\u20131810) was one example, considered an eccentric by his peers, who was also referred to as a pagan and a polytheist. In Fransham's 1769 book ''The Oestrum of Orpheus'', he advanced a theology similar to that of the [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonists]]: that the first cause of existence is uncreated and indestructible, but not intelligent, and that the universe is shaped by \"innumerable intelligent powers or forces, 'plastic and designing,' who ruled all sublunary affairs, and may most fitly be designated by the nomenclature of the Hellenic theology.\"<ref name=survival/> Despite his apparent belief in the Hellenic gods, Fransham does not seem to have been particularly devoted to their worship. According to an 1875 profile in ''Fraser's Magazine'', Franshem's \"libations to the [[Penates]] found their way down his own throat, and when he sacrificed a fowl to [[Asclepius|'Esculapius]] it was usually in the form of chicken-broth for his supper.\"<ref name=survival/>\n\nAnother example of an 18th-century literary figure who may have considered himself a Hellenist was [[Thomas Taylor (neoplatonist)|Thomas Taylor]] (1758\u20131835), who produced the first English translations of many neoplatonic philosophical and religious texts. Taylor was widely known as the \"English Platonist\", and rumors existed that he had produced anonymous pamphlets advocating a return to a sort of pagan religion (these rumors have been debunked by modern scholars<ref>Addey, Tim. [http://www.prometheustrust.co.uk/Why_Thomas_Taylor_is_not_the_author_of_A_New_System_of_Religion.pdf Why Thomas Taylor is not the author of ''A New System of Religion'']. Prometheus Trust.</ref>). Though the extent of his actual devotion to Ancient Greek spirituality remains unknown, brief descriptions written by others about him tend to portray him as a sincerely devout polytheist.<ref name=survival/> One such sketch, written by [[Isaac D'Israeli]], describes Taylor delaying answering his door until he has finished his mid-day hymn to Apollo, and reports that his study contained a hanging globe of clear glass, representing Zeus, that scattered sunbeams he would use to read and write, shifting his position in the room to follow them throughout the day.<ref name=survival/>\n\nHis work inspired a limited number devotees.<ref name=survival>\"The Survival of Paganism\".

In 1788, Valadi traveled to England in order to convince an unnamed \"gentleman of eminence in the literary world\" to become the head of a new Pythagorean sect, assuring him that Valadi would help him find numerous followers.<ref name=valadi>\"Modern Platonism\".

Valadi began his studies at Glasgow, where he learned of Taylor, to whom he wrote in a letter:\n\n:\"''My determination was to go and live in North America, and there to keep a school of temperance and love, in order to preserve so many men from the prevailing vices of brutal intemperance and selfish cupidity ... There I would devoutly erect altars to my favourite Gods: Dioscuri, Hector, Aristomenes, Pan, Orpheus, Epaminondas, Pythagoras, Pluto, Timoleon, Marcus Brutus and his Portia, and above all, [[Helios|Phoebus]], the God of my hero [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] ...''\"<ref name=survival/>\n\nValadi paid Taylor to live in his house and study under him, but his tenure as Taylor's disciple was short lived. He returned to France to fight in the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 (he reportedly said, \"I came over Diogenes. I am going back Alexander.\"), and was executed by guillotine in December 1793.<ref name=valadi/>\n\n===20th century===\nIn the early 20th century, several [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] groups were formed, often incorporating elements of ancient Greek religion and honoring Greek gods, but with heavily syncretic elements drawn from Hermeticism and 19th century folklore studies. Most prominent of these modern traditions are [[Thelema]] and [[Wicca]], though [[Feraferia]] (an American tradition founded in the 1970s by Fred Adams) places heavier emphasis on a more Hellenistic style of worship and on the Greaco-Roman pantheon of gods.<ref>http://feraferia.org</ref> One Wiccan organization in the United States, the [[Aquarian Tabernacle Church]], began to host a spring festival based on the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]] in 1985, which has continued to be held every year through the present day.<ref>[https://wildhunt.org/2019/03/aquarian-tabernacle-church-names-new-arch-priest.html Aquarian Tabernacle Church names new Arch Priest].</ref>\n\nDuring the 1970s, some began to reject the influence of Hermeticism and other heavily syncretic forms of Greek religion in preference of practices reconstructing earlier or more original forms of Hellenic worship. Early revivalists of Hellenic religion tended to be individuals working alone, and early attempts to organize adherents into larger groups failed. The first successful revival attempt was made by the [[Supreme Council of Ethnikoi Hellenes]] (or YSEE). In 1993, a variety of adherents to the Hellenic religion in Greece and elsewhere came together and began the process of organization. This resulted in a \"Hellenic National Assembly\", initiated at a gathering in southern Olympus on the 9th of September 1995. The process culminated with the formal establishment of the [[Supreme Council of Ethnic Hellenes|YSEE]] as a [[nonprofit organization|non-profit]] in Greece, in June 1997.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ysee.gr/about.html |title=Who We Are and What We Want |publisher=Ysee.gr |date= |accessdate=2019-03-28}}</ref>\n\n===21st century and official recognition===\n'''2004 Olympics controversy'''\n\nThe [[2004 Summer Olympics]] stirred up several disputes concerning Hellenic polytheistic religion.\n* Professor Giorgos Dontas, president of the [[Archaeological Society of Athens]] expressed public outrage at the destruction of ancient archaeological sites{{which|date=June 2016}} around the [[Parthenon]] and [[Acropolis]] in preparation for the Games.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/jul/15/internationaleducationnews.artsnews|title=Drills and axes ravage ancient Greek site|author=Helena Smith|date=15 July 2002|website=theguardian.com|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=7 May 2015}}</ref>\n* Prior to the Olympic Games, [[MSNBC]] correspondent Rehema Ellis in a story called ''It's Greek to Me: Group Tries to Restore Pagan Worship'' documented the vandalism and arson of a bookstore in Athens which sold books promoting ancient Greek religion.

It was the first such rite performed at the temple since the ancient Greek religion was outlawed by the Roman government in the late 4th century.<ref>Associated Press, Zeus Worshippers Demand Access to Temple. ''The New York Times'', January 19, 2007</ref> The ceremony involved participants dressed as ancient warriors who left their swords and spears outside the sacred site, in order to represent the laying down of arms before the Olympic games. The BBC referred to the event as a show of \"intentional publicity\". The event caught the attention of the Greek Orthodox Church. Reporters at the event suggested the church might step up their opposition to the legitimizing of Hellenism. Father Eustathios Kollas, who presided over a community of Greek Orthodox priests, said: ''\"They are a handful of miserable resuscitators of a degenerate dead religion who wish to return to the monstrous dark delusions of the past.\"''<ref name=\"Ancient Greek gods' new believers\">Ancient Greek gods' new believers.

In 1999 Hatley deployed with the [[5th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|5th Cavalry Regiment]] to [[Operation Joint Forge]] in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. In 2001 Hatley again deployed to the [[Balkans]] this time as part of [[Kosovo Force|Operation Joint Guardian II]] in Kosovo. The first of Hatley's two deployments to Iraq came in 2004 where he worked in the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]]'s Operations section.

On 18 January 2008, appellant\u2019s battalion commander gave\nappellant an order to have no contact with the other soldiers in his company until the investigation\nwas complete.  The commander also ordered appellant to remain under the supervision of his command\nsergeant major (CSM, the most senior ranking NCO of battalion and higher units) until he was\ninterviewed by Army criminal investigators the following day and to remain on the installation.\nAppellant continued his preparations for reassignment, cleared his family quarters, and placed his\nhousehold goods in shipment.  However, in February 2008 his orders were revoked and he was assigned\nto live in bachelor quarters at a soon-to-close installation in W\u00fcrzburg, Germany, approximately a\n30 minute drive from Schweinfurt. Appellant was denied leave to accompany his wife back to the U.S.\nHowever, his wife returned to live with appellant in Germany a few weeks later.  By April, appellant\nwas again assigned family quarters in Schweinfurt and received his household goods from storage.\n\n\nFrom February to May 2008, appellant\u2019s primary duty was to report daily to his CSM.  From\nFebruary to April, appellant drove himself from W\u00fcrzburg to Schweinfurt.  Appellant\u2019s CSM sought an\nappropriate position for appellant, and in late May or early June 2008, appellant began duties at\nthe housing office in Schweinfurt, where he worked until his trial in April 2009.  During this\ntimeframe appellant was granted several leaves; however, he was not permitted to travel outside\nGermany.\n\n\nOn 16 September 2008 appellant\u2019s command preferred court-martial charges against appellant.  On\n8 October 2008 appellant waived his right to an Article 32 pretrial investigation hearing (a\nprerequisite to trial by general court-martial).  The convening authority referred appellant\u2019s case\nto a general court-martial on 5 January 2009.  Appellant was arraigned on 11 January 2009, 119 days\nafter preferral of charges.  At arraignment, appellant requested a trial date in early February\n2009.  Over defense objection, the military judge set trial for 13 April 2009 based on the\nGovernment\u2019s request to complete the trials of multiple co-accuseds, including SFC Mayo and SGT\nLeahy, whose trials had not yet concluded.  In February 2009, Sergeant Leahy pled not guilty but was\nfound guilty of premeditated murder and was sentenced, as required by UCMJ art. 118, to a mandatory\nsentence of life in prison, with possibility for parole.  In March 2009 SFC Mayo pled guilty to\npremeditated murder in exchange for a pretrial agreement limiting his confinement to 30 years,\nrather than confinement for life otherwise required for conviction of premeditated murder.<ref>{{cite web |last1=ARMY |title=United States v.

Latin was sometimes used in the theology faculty, but it was essentially a French-language institution. Lectures in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the other [[official language]] of Belgium and the language spoken in Leuven, began to be provided in 1930.\n\nIn 1962, in line with constitutional reforms governing official language use, the French and Dutch sections of the university became autonomous within a common governing structure. [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalists]] continued to demand a division of the university, and Dutch speakers expressed resentment at privileges given to French-speaking academic staff and the perceived disdain by the local French-speaking community for their Dutch-speaking neighbours. At the time, Brussels and Leuven were both part of the officially bilingual and now defunct [[Province of Brabant]]; but [[Francization of Brussels|unlike Brussels]], Leuven had retained its Dutch-speaking character. Tensions rose when a French-speaking [[Social geography|social geographer]] suggested in a televised lecture that the city of Leuven should be incorporated into an enlarged [[bilingual]] 'Greater-Brussels' region. Mainstream Flemish politicians and students began demonstrating under the slogan 'Leuven Vlaams \u2013 Walen Buiten' (\"Leuven [is] Flemish \u2013 [[Walloons]] out\"). Student demonstrations escalated into violence throughout the mid-1960s. Student unrest fueled by the [[Language legislation in Belgium|history of discrimination against Flemings]] eventually brought down the Belgian government in February 1968.\n\nThe dispute was resolved in June 1968 by turning the [[Dutch-language]] section of the university into the independent [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], which remained in Leuven. The French-speaking university, called the [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain]], was moved to a [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] campus called [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] (\"New Leuven\"), farther south in the French-speaking part of the Province of Brabant. Acrimony about the split was long-lasting. Nowadays, however, research collaborations and student exchanges between the two \"sister universities\" take place with increasing frequency.\n\n==Library==\n[[File:Louvain Library WWI.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the library of the Catholic University of Leuven after the library was burned by the German army in 1914.]]\n\nThe holdings of the modern Catholic University of Leuven date back to 1834. Its main collections were held in a building on Naamsestraat dating back to the 17th century. It was only the collections of the university since its founding in 1834 that were lost. The manuscripts and most valuable works of the pre-revolutionary Old University, were transported<ref>''Leuven University'', p. 31: \"The university colleges were closed on 9 november 1797, and all items of use, with all the books, were requisitioned for the new \u00c9cole Centrale, in Brussels\"</ref> to the National Library in Paris, while the bulk of the holdings (at least officially) was transferred to the [[Central School of Brussels]], the official legal successor of the [[Old University of Leuven]]. The library of the Central School of Brussels had about 80,000 volumes, which then became part of the library of Brussels, and then the future [[Royal Library of Belgium]] where they are still found. The extensive archives of the Old University are now part of the State Archives in Belgium.<ref>[http://www.arch.be/ arch.be]{{Clarify|date=August 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Leuven-University-Library.jpg|thumb|The library building designed by [[Whitney Warren]] and built from 1921\u20131928, now the KUL's central library.]]\nFollowing the destruction of the library, a new library building was constructed on the [[Ladeuzeplein|Mgr.

It was designed by the American architect [[Whitney Warren]] in a neo-Flemish-Renaissance style, and built between 1921 and 1928.<ref name=\"Impe2012\">{{cite book|author=Jan van Impe|title=De Leuvense universiteitsbibliotheek / druk 2: historische wandelgids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WL5uPw3HiwC&pg=PT26|accessdate=29 June 2013|date=20 November 2012|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=978-90-5867-920-8|page=26}}</ref> Its monumental size is a reflection of the Allied victory against [[Germany]], and it is one of the largest university buildings in the city. The library's collections were rebuilt with donations from all around the world, outraged by the barbaric act which it had suffered. In 1940, during the second German invasion of Leuven, the building largely burnt down, including its 900,000 manuscripts and books. The building was rebuilt after the war in accordance with Warren's design.\n\nThe library's collections were again restored after the war, and by the fission in 1968 had approximately four million books.\nThe split of the university into separate French-language and Dutch-language institutions in 1968 entailed a division of the central library holdings.  This was done on the basis of alternate shelfmarks (except in cases where a work clearly belonged to one section or the other, e.g. was written by a member of faculty or bequeathed by an alumnus whose linguistic allegiance was clear). This gave rise to the [[factoid]] that encyclopedias and runs of periodicals were divided by volume between the two universities, but actually such series bear single shelfmarks.\n\nThe building on the Mgr. Ladeuzeplein is now the central library of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Theodor Schwann]] (1810\u20131882), developer of [[cell theory]] and discoverer of [[Schwann cells]] (professor)\n* [[Louis Defr\u00e9]] (aka Maurice Voituron) (1816\u20131880), lawyer and burgomaster of [[Uccle]]\n* [[Charles-Louis-Joseph-Xavier de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin]] (1827\u20131903), a [[mineralogist]] and [[geologist]]\n* [[Auguste Marie Fran\u00e7ois Beernaert]] (1829\u20131912), [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] and winner of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Patrick Francis Healy]] (1830\u20131910), president of [[Georgetown University]], first [[Jesuit]] priest of [[African American]] ancestry, first American of acknowledged African-American ancestry to earn PhD\n* [[Antanas Baranauskas]] (1835\u20131902), Lithuanian [[poet]].\n* [[Arthur Vierendeel]] (1852\u20131940) civil engineer.\n* [[E.

The library was lost, as well as about 300,000 books, about 1000 [[incunable|incunabula]];<ref>[http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF Lost Memory - Libraries and Archives Destroyed in the Twentieth Century] ( {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905105742/http://www.unesco.org/webworld/mdm/administ/pdf/LOSTMEMO.PDF |date=5 September 2012 }})</ref> and a huge collection of [[manuscripts]], such as the [[Easter Island]] tablet bearing [[Rongorongo text E]] or [[cz:Bible leskovecko-dr\u00e1\u017e\u010fansk\u00e1|the oldest Czech Bible]] In the early stages of the war, Allied propaganda capitalized on the German destruction as a reflection on German ''Kultur''.\n\n====The split (1962\u20131970)====\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}\n{{main|Split of the Catholic University of Leuven}}\nFrom its beginning in 1834, the Catholic University of Louvain provided lectures only in [[French language|French]]. Latin was sometimes used in the theology faculty, but it was essentially a French-language institution. Lectures in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], the other [[official language]] of Belgium and the language spoken in Leuven, began to be provided in 1930.\n\nIn 1962, in line with constitutional reforms governing official language use, the French and Dutch sections of the university became autonomous within a common governing structure. [[Flemish Movement|Flemish nationalists]] continued to demand a division of the university, and Dutch speakers expressed resentment at privileges given to French-speaking academic staff and the perceived disdain by the local French-speaking community for their Dutch-speaking neighbours. At the time, Brussels and Leuven were both part of the officially bilingual and now defunct [[Province of Brabant]]; but [[Francization of Brussels|unlike Brussels]], Leuven had retained its Dutch-speaking character. Tensions rose when a French-speaking [[Social geography|social geographer]] suggested in a televised lecture that the city of Leuven should be incorporated into an enlarged [[bilingual]] 'Greater-Brussels' region. Mainstream Flemish politicians and students began demonstrating under the slogan 'Leuven Vlaams \u2013 Walen Buiten' (\"Leuven [is] Flemish \u2013 [[Walloons]] out\"). Student demonstrations escalated into violence throughout the mid-1960s. Student unrest fueled by the [[Language legislation in Belgium|history of discrimination against Flemings]] eventually brought down the Belgian government in February 1968.\n\nThe dispute was resolved in June 1968 by turning the [[Dutch-language]] section of the university into the independent [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]], which remained in Leuven. The French-speaking university, called the [[Universit\u00e9 catholique de Louvain]], was moved to a [[Greenfield land|greenfield]] campus called [[Louvain-la-Neuve]] (\"New Leuven\"), farther south in the French-speaking part of the Province of Brabant. Acrimony about the split was long-lasting. Nowadays, however, research collaborations and student exchanges between the two \"sister universities\" take place with increasing frequency.\n\n==Library==\n[[File:Louvain Library WWI.jpg|thumb|The ruins of the library of the Catholic University of Leuven after the library was burned by the German army in 1914.]]\n\nThe holdings of the modern Catholic University of Leuven date back to 1834. Its main collections were held in a building on Naamsestraat dating back to the 17th century. It was only the collections of the university since its founding in 1834 that were lost. The manuscripts and most valuable works of the pre-revolutionary Old University, were transported<ref>''Leuven University'', p. 31: \"The university colleges were closed on 9 november 1797, and all items of use, with all the books, were requisitioned for the new \u00c9cole Centrale, in Brussels\"</ref> to the National Library in Paris, while the bulk of the holdings (at least officially) was transferred to the [[Central School of Brussels]], the official legal successor of the [[Old University of Leuven]]. The library of the Central School of Brussels had about 80,000 volumes, which then became part of the library of Brussels, and then the future [[Royal Library of Belgium]] where they are still found. The extensive archives of the Old University are now part of the State Archives in Belgium.<ref>[http://www.arch.be/ arch.be]{{Clarify|date=August 2013}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Leuven-University-Library.jpg|thumb|The library building designed by [[Whitney Warren]] and built from 1921\u20131928, now the KUL's central library.]]\nFollowing the destruction of the library, a new library building was constructed on the [[Ladeuzeplein|Mgr. Ladeuzeplein]]. It was designed by the American architect [[Whitney Warren]] in a neo-Flemish-Renaissance style, and built between 1921 and 1928.<ref name=\"Impe2012\">{{cite book|author=Jan van Impe|title=De Leuvense universiteitsbibliotheek / druk 2: historische wandelgids|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9WL5uPw3HiwC&pg=PT26|accessdate=29 June 2013|date=20 November 2012|publisher=Leuven University Press|isbn=978-90-5867-920-8|page=26}}</ref> Its monumental size is a reflection of the Allied victory against [[Germany]], and it is one of the largest university buildings in the city. The library's collections were rebuilt with donations from all around the world, outraged by the barbaric act which it had suffered. In 1940, during the second German invasion of Leuven, the building largely burnt down, including its 900,000 manuscripts and books. The building was rebuilt after the war in accordance with Warren's design.\n\nThe library's collections were again restored after the war, and by the fission in 1968 had approximately four million books.\nThe split of the university into separate French-language and Dutch-language institutions in 1968 entailed a division of the central library holdings.  This was done on the basis of alternate shelfmarks (except in cases where a work clearly belonged to one section or the other, e.g. was written by a member of faculty or bequeathed by an alumnus whose linguistic allegiance was clear). This gave rise to the [[factoid]] that encyclopedias and runs of periodicals were divided by volume between the two universities, but actually such series bear single shelfmarks.\n\nThe building on the Mgr. Ladeuzeplein is now the central library of the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven.\n\n==Notable alumni==\n* [[Theodor Schwann]] (1810\u20131882), developer of [[cell theory]] and discoverer of [[Schwann cells]] (professor)\n* [[Louis Defr\u00e9]] (aka Maurice Voituron) (1816\u20131880), lawyer and burgomaster of [[Uccle]]\n* [[Charles-Louis-Joseph-Xavier de la Vall\u00e9e-Poussin]] (1827\u20131903), a [[mineralogist]] and [[geologist]]\n* [[Auguste Marie Fran\u00e7ois Beernaert]] (1829\u20131912), [[Prime Minister of Belgium]] and winner of the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]\n* [[Patrick Francis Healy]] (1830\u20131910), president of [[Georgetown University]], first [[Jesuit]] priest of [[African American]] ancestry, first American of acknowledged African-American ancestry to earn PhD\n* [[Antanas Baranauskas]] (1835\u20131902), Lithuanian [[poet]].\n* [[Arthur Vierendeel]] (1852\u20131940) civil engineer.\n* [[E.

Harvey notes that the series' diverse range of genres show that it is \"manifestly the work of someone who has clocked up many hours of screen time\". He further comments that Brooker is \"scrupulous\", as \"the believability of each episode depends on maintaining the complex internal logic of its dystopic world\". Brooker is involved during the filming and editing processes, pointing out any inconsistencies that arise, and is \"determined to make the devices and screens and interfaces used in 'Black Mirror' seem authentic\". As examples of Brooker's \"meticulous attention to detail\", Harvey reports that Brooker carefully considered whether a falling wine bottle would shatter in the nested virtual realities of \"[[Playtest (Black Mirror)|Playtest]]\", and whether it would rain in the eponymous location in \"[[San Junipero]]\". An instance of realistic technology is the email system in \"[[Be Right Back]]\", which contrasts with \"histrionic computers\" found in Hollywood; an email is sent to the main character with the heading \"Martha, people in your position bought the following\", containing various books on the topic of grief-counseling.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-speculative-dread-of-black-mirror |title=The Speculative Dread of \"Black Mirror\" |last=Harvey |first=Giles |website=[[The New Yorker]] |date=28 November 2016 |accessdate=16 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222050640/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-speculative-dread-of-black-mirror |archive-date=22 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Knowing that fans of the series have dissected some of these details by watching the episodes frame-by-frame, Brooker and his team have included humorous jabs at these fans through printed messages on various props, such as a paragraph in a news article held up by a character directed to fans of the series on [[Reddit]] in \"[[Crocodile (Black Mirror) |Crocodile]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-reddit-fans-easter-egg-crocodile/ |title='Black Mirror' Trolls Eagle-Eyed Reddit Users With Insane Season 4 Easter Egg |first=Jennifer |last=Maas |date=1 January 2018 |accessdate=2 January 2018 |website=[[The Wrap]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102033759/https://www.thewrap.com/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-reddit-fans-easter-egg-crocodile/ |archive-date=2 January 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Series 1 ===\nThe series' inception was in 2010. Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones served as executive producers; the two had begun to work together on ''[[Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe]]'', a television review programme which aired from 2006 to 2008. The first pitch, to the head of comedy at Channel 4, was for eight half-hour episodes written by different people. Technology was a lesser focus, and the worlds were larger and more detailed, which Jones said was not possible to execute properly in the short runtime. The series was then commissioned for three hour-long episodes. The first script was \"[[Fifteen Million Merits]]\", which was written by Brooker and his wife [[Konnie Huq]]. The second script was \"Inbound\", which episode was never produced; it was about war and contained concepts which were later repurposed for the series 3 episode \"[[Men Against Fire]]\". The following script pitched became \"[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]\", the first episode to air. The third episode is \"[[The Entire History of You]]\".<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>{{rp|6\u201313}}\n\nThe programme was produced by Brooker's production company Zeppotron, for [[Endemol]].

Shane Allen, head of comedy for Channel 4 at the time, stated in 2018 that someone had been taken aback by the budget for ''Black Mirror'', which was well above the standard for a comedy, and became involved in the editorial process. A new head of comedy had been hired, who did not have a relationship with Brooker and Jones.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|101\u2013103}}\n\nBrooker reported in 2018 that Channel 4 agreed on a third series of four episodes, but requested detailed synopses of the episodes in advance. Brooker came up with an episode \"Angel of the Morning\", which would later become a story in \"[[White Christmas (Black Mirror)|White Christmas]]\". He also conceived of an episode based on the earlier script \"Inbound\" which would have been similar to a later series 3 episode, \"Men Against Fire\". Another episode was named \"Crocodile\", which overlapped in parts with the series 4 episode of the same name. After a lengthy wait, Brooker and Jones were told that the ideas \"weren't very ''Black Mirror''\". Though Channel 4 may have suggested doing a one-off special, Jones said that \"we felt there wasn't any clarity from the channel\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|101\u2013103}}\n\nJones and Brooker worked on other projects for the next year, such as the comedy procedural ''[[A Touch of Cloth]]''. After bumping into a Channel 4 staff member, Brooker emailed the channel to ask about how to continue with ''Black Mirror''. Channel 4 had the budget for an hour-long Christmas special, but Jones and Brooker pushed for a 90-minute episode.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|101\u2013103}}\n\n\"White Christmas\" was a portmanteau of three stories, inspired by works such as the 1983 science fiction film ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|101\u2013103}} It starred [[Jon Hamm]] as Matt and [[Rafe Spall]] as Joe throughout. Actors in the individual stories include: [[Rasmus Hardiker]] as Harry, [[Natalia Tena]] as Jennifer, [[Oona Chaplin]] as Greta, [[Janet Montgomery]] as Beth, and Ken Drury as Beth's father. The episode aired on 16 December 2014.\n\n=== Move to Netflix ===\nOn the day of the press screening for \"White Christmas\", Brooker and Jones had a meeting with Channel 4 executives, who told them that they wanted to continue the series but due to budget constraints, it would need to be a co-production. The pair had travelled to Los Angeles a few months prior to try to get co-production money but were unsuccessful. The channel also suggested that Brooker could write an episode of ''[[Electric Dreams (2017 TV series)|Electric Dreams]]'', a 2017 adaptation of short stories by [[Philip K. Dick]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|123\u2013124}}\n\nIn December 2014, the first two series of the programme were released on [[Netflix]] in the United States after they bought exclusive streaming rights, leading to increased attention for the programme.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/netflix-run-brings-u-k-s-black-mirror-into-light-for-u-s-auds-1201380236/|title=Netflix Run Brings U.K.'s 'Black Mirror' Into Light for U.S. Auds|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=26 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040808/https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/netflix-run-brings-u-k-s-black-mirror-into-light-for-u-s-auds-1201380236/|archive-date=27 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In a bidding war between channels, which included several American networks, Netflix led with a commitment of two series of ten episodes each. Brooker and Jones reported in 2018 that although they and Netflix were both keen to have Channel 4 as equal partners, they could not get a meeting with Channel 4. They eventually got a meeting without discussion of a co-production with Netflix, where the channel suggested a renewal for three episodes. The channel later offered six episodes if full treatments could be given in advance, but Brooker and Jones were concerned due to past rejection of ideas. They had a limited time to reply to U.S. offers and chose to make a deal with Netflix.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|125\u2013126}}\n\nIn September 2015, Netflix officially commissioned 12 episodes of ''Black Mirror''.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-black-mirror-new-episodes-1201602037/ |title='Black Mirror' Lands at Netflix |first=Debra |last=Birnbaum |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=25 September 2015 |accessdate=26 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612162641/https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/netflix-black-mirror-new-episodes-1201602037/ |archive-date=12 June 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref> In March 2016, it outbid Channel 4 for the rights to distributing the third series in the UK, with a bid of {{US$|40&nbsp;million}}.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/29/netflix-channel-4-charlie-brooker-black-mirror |title=Netflix deals Channel 4 knockout blow over Charlie Brooker's Black Mirror |first=John |last=Plunkett |date=29 March 2016 |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=11 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171230021155/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/mar/29/netflix-channel-4-charlie-brooker-black-mirror |archive-date=30 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Endemol released a statement saying that Channel 4 had \"had the opportunity to recommission [''Black Mirror''] since 2013 and passed on this and subsequent co-production offers put to them.

Coupled with the anthology format that asked for viewers to get immersed within the stories to understand the nature of each, this created a sense of darkness and horror, which could make it difficult to watch successive episodes without becoming uncomfortable. With the third series, Brooker wanted to explore different formats, still having a few \"trap\" episodes but adding more conventional stories like a romance and police procedural, making the new series more digestible for the viewer.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/black-mirror-traps/ |title=What Happens When Black Mirror Moves Beyond Traps?

British TV station --> [[dystopia]]n [[science fiction]] [[comedy-drama]] [[Anthology series|anthology]] television series created by [[Charlie Brooker]]. He and [[Annabel Jones]] are the programme's [[showrunner]]s. It examines modern society, particularly with regard to the unanticipated consequences of [[Post-industrial society|new technologies]]. Episodes are standalone, usually set in an [[alternative history|alternative present]] or the near future, often with a dark and satirical tone, although some are more experimental and lighter.\n\n''Black Mirror'' was inspired by older anthology series, such as ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', which Brooker felt were able to deal with controversial, contemporary topics with less fear of censorship than other more realistic programmes. Brooker developed ''Black Mirror'' to highlight topics related to humanity's relationship with technology, creating stories that feature \"the way we live now&nbsp;\u2013 and the way we might be living in 10 minutes' time if we're clumsy.\"<ref name=\"guardian_a\"/>\n\nThe series premiered for two series on [[Channel 4]] in December 2011 and February 2013. After its addition to the catalogue in December 2014, [[Netflix]] purchased the programme in September 2015. It commissioned a series of 12 episodes later divided into the third and fourth series, each comprising six episodes; the former was released on 21 October 2016 and the latter on 29 December 2017. A standalone [[interactive film]] titled ''[[Black Mirror: Bandersnatch]]'' was released on 28 December 2018. A fifth series, comprising three episodes, was released on 5 June 2019.<ref name=\"S5ReleaseDate\" />\n\nThe series has garnered positive reception from critics, received many [[List of awards and nominations received by Black Mirror|awards and nominations]], and seen an increase in interest internationally, particularly in the United States after its addition to Netflix.

Harvey notes that the series' diverse range of genres show that it is \"manifestly the work of someone who has clocked up many hours of screen time\". He further comments that Brooker is \"scrupulous\", as \"the believability of each episode depends on maintaining the complex internal logic of its dystopic world\". Brooker is involved during the filming and editing processes, pointing out any inconsistencies that arise, and is \"determined to make the devices and screens and interfaces used in 'Black Mirror' seem authentic\". As examples of Brooker's \"meticulous attention to detail\", Harvey reports that Brooker carefully considered whether a falling wine bottle would shatter in the nested virtual realities of \"[[Playtest (Black Mirror)|Playtest]]\", and whether it would rain in the eponymous location in \"[[San Junipero]]\". An instance of realistic technology is the email system in \"[[Be Right Back]]\", which contrasts with \"histrionic computers\" found in Hollywood; an email is sent to the main character with the heading \"Martha, people in your position bought the following\", containing various books on the topic of grief-counseling.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-speculative-dread-of-black-mirror |title=The Speculative Dread of \"Black Mirror\" |last=Harvey |first=Giles |website=[[The New Yorker]] |date=28 November 2016 |accessdate=16 December 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222050640/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/11/28/the-speculative-dread-of-black-mirror |archive-date=22 December 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Knowing that fans of the series have dissected some of these details by watching the episodes frame-by-frame, Brooker and his team have included humorous jabs at these fans through printed messages on various props, such as a paragraph in a news article held up by a character directed to fans of the series on [[Reddit]] in \"[[Crocodile (Black Mirror) |Crocodile]]\".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-reddit-fans-easter-egg-crocodile/ |title='Black Mirror' Trolls Eagle-Eyed Reddit Users With Insane Season 4 Easter Egg |first=Jennifer |last=Maas |date=1 January 2018 |accessdate=2 January 2018 |website=[[The Wrap]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102033759/https://www.thewrap.com/black-mirror-charlie-brooker-reddit-fans-easter-egg-crocodile/ |archive-date=2 January 2018 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n=== Series 1 ===\nThe series' inception was in 2010. Charlie Brooker and Annabel Jones served as executive producers; the two had begun to work together on ''[[Charlie Brooker's Screenwipe]]'', a television review programme which aired from 2006 to 2008. The first pitch, to the head of comedy at Channel 4, was for eight half-hour episodes written by different people. Technology was a lesser focus, and the worlds were larger and more detailed, which Jones said was not possible to execute properly in the short runtime. The series was then commissioned for three hour-long episodes. The first script was \"[[Fifteen Million Merits]]\", which was written by Brooker and his wife [[Konnie Huq]]. The second script was \"Inbound\", which episode was never produced; it was about war and contained concepts which were later repurposed for the series 3 episode \"[[Men Against Fire]]\". The following script pitched became \"[[The National Anthem (Black Mirror)|The National Anthem]]\", the first episode to air. The third episode is \"[[The Entire History of You]]\".<ref name=\"ibm\">{{cite book | title=  Inside Black Mirror | date = November 2018 | first1 = Charlie | last1 = Brooker | first2 = Annabel | last2 = Jones | first3 = Jason | last3 = Arnopp | isbn = 9781984823489 | publisher =  [[Crown Publishing Group]] | place = New York City }}</ref>{{rp|6\u201313}}\n\nThe programme was produced by Brooker's production company Zeppotron, for [[Endemol]].

Shane Allen, head of comedy for Channel 4 at the time, stated in 2018 that someone had been taken aback by the budget for ''Black Mirror'', which was well above the standard for a comedy, and became involved in the editorial process. A new head of comedy had been hired, who did not have a relationship with Brooker and Jones.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|101\u2013103}}\n\nBrooker reported in 2018 that Channel 4 agreed on a third series of four episodes, but requested detailed synopses of the episodes in advance. Brooker came up with an episode \"Angel of the Morning\", which would later become a story in \"[[White Christmas (Black Mirror)|White Christmas]]\". He also conceived of an episode based on the earlier script \"Inbound\" which would have been similar to a later series 3 episode, \"Men Against Fire\". Another episode was named \"Crocodile\", which overlapped in parts with the series 4 episode of the same name. After a lengthy wait, Brooker and Jones were told that the ideas \"weren't very ''Black Mirror''\". Though Channel 4 may have suggested doing a one-off special, Jones said that \"we felt there wasn't any clarity from the channel\".<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|101\u2013103}}\n\nJones and Brooker worked on other projects for the next year, such as the comedy procedural ''[[A Touch of Cloth]]''. After bumping into a Channel 4 staff member, Brooker emailed the channel to ask about how to continue with ''Black Mirror''. Channel 4 had the budget for an hour-long Christmas special, but Jones and Brooker pushed for a 90-minute episode.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|101\u2013103}}\n\n\"White Christmas\" was a portmanteau of three stories, inspired by works such as the 1983 science fiction film ''[[Twilight Zone: The Movie]]''.<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|101\u2013103}} It starred [[Jon Hamm]] as Matt and [[Rafe Spall]] as Joe throughout. Actors in the individual stories include: [[Rasmus Hardiker]] as Harry, [[Natalia Tena]] as Jennifer, [[Oona Chaplin]] as Greta, [[Janet Montgomery]] as Beth, and Ken Drury as Beth's father. The episode aired on 16 December 2014.\n\n=== Move to Netflix ===\nOn the day of the press screening for \"White Christmas\", Brooker and Jones had a meeting with Channel 4 executives, who told them that they wanted to continue the series but due to budget constraints, it would need to be a co-production. The pair had travelled to Los Angeles a few months prior to try to get co-production money but were unsuccessful. The channel also suggested that Brooker could write an episode of ''[[Electric Dreams (2017 TV series)|Electric Dreams]]'', a 2017 adaptation of short stories by [[Philip K. Dick]].<ref name=\"ibm\"/>{{rp|123\u2013124}}\n\nIn December 2014, the first two series of the programme were released on [[Netflix]] in the United States after they bought exclusive streaming rights, leading to increased attention for the programme.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/netflix-run-brings-u-k-s-black-mirror-into-light-for-u-s-auds-1201380236/|title=Netflix Run Brings U.K.'s 'Black Mirror' Into Light for U.S. Auds|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|last=Spangler|first=Todd|date=18 December 2014|accessdate=26 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181227040808/https://variety.com/2014/tv/news/netflix-run-brings-u-k-s-black-mirror-into-light-for-u-s-auds-1201380236/|archive-date=27 December 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> In a bidding war between channels, which included several American networks, Netflix led with a commitment of two series of ten episodes each. Brooker and Jones reported in 2018 that although they and Netflix were both keen to have Channel 4 as equal partners, they could not get a meeting with Channel 4. They eventually got a meeting without discussion of a co-production with Netflix, where the channel suggested a renewal for three episodes. The channel later offered six episodes if full treatments could be given in advance, but Brooker and Jones were concerned due to past rejection of ideas.

Coupled with the anthology format that asked for viewers to get immersed within the stories to understand the nature of each, this created a sense of darkness and horror, which could make it difficult to watch successive episodes without becoming uncomfortable. With the third series, Brooker wanted to explore different formats, still having a few \"trap\" episodes but adding more conventional stories like a romance and police procedural, making the new series more digestible for the viewer.<ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/10/black-mirror-traps/ |title=What Happens When Black Mirror Moves Beyond Traps?
