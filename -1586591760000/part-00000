The western wing consisted of the merger of [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|Northwest Frontier Province]], [[West Punjab]], and [[Sind Province (1936\u20131955)|Sindh]], the [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan Chief Commissioners Province]], thirteen [[princely state]]s. The eastern wing consisted of [[East Bengal]], the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] and [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] from the former [[Provinces of India|British Raj province]] of [[Assam]].\n\nIn 1948, [[Karachi]] was separated from Sindh to form the [[Federal Capital Territory (Pakistan)|Federal Capital Territory]]. In 1950, the Northwest Frontier Province absorbed the princely states of [[Amb (princely state)|Amb]] and [[Phulra (princely state)|Phulra]] while West Punjab renamed itself to Punjab. In 1952, the four princely states in the southwest formed the [[Baluchistan States Union]].\n\nIn 1955, the ''[[One Unit]] Policy'' was launched by [[Muhammad Ali Bogra]], whereby all the provinces and princely states of the western wing were merged and formed [[West Pakistan]], with [[Lahore]] as the provincial capital. Simultaneously, East Bengal (including Sylhet and the Hill Tracts) was renamed to [[East Pakistan]], with [[Dacca]] as the provincial capital. The One Unit Policy aimed to reduce expenditure and to eliminate provincial prejudices, but the military coup of 1958 signaled difficulties when the first military President, [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]], abolished the office of Chief Minister of West Pakistan in favour of Governor's rule.\n\nOn 7 September 1958, after four years of negotiations, including six months of intense negotiations, Pakistan purchased the [[Gwadar]] enclave from the [[Sultanate of Muscat and Oman|government of Oman]] for 5.5 billion rupees/ USD $3 million (approx. $22,410,311.42 in 2017). Gwadar formally became part of Pakistan on 8 December 1958 after 174 years of Omani rule. In 1960, the federal capital moved from Karachi to [[Rawalpindi]] and in 1961, the Federal Capital Territory was merged into West Pakistan. In 1966, the capital was again moved to [[Islamabad]]. In 1962, [[Dacca]] was made the legislative capital of the country due to [[East Pakistan]]'s high population.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pakistan Affairs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFIdAQAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Information Division, Embassy of Pakistan.|page=19}}</ref> In 1963, Pakistan entered into a treaty with China to transfer part of the Gilgit Agency to China (Shaksgam Valley\u2014the Trans-Karakoram Tract) with the provision that the settlement was subject to the final solution of the Kashmir dispute.\n\n===Since 1970===\nIn 1970, the second military President, [[Yahya Khan]], abolished West Pakistan and established four new provinces: Sindh, Balochistan, Northwest Frontier Province and Punjab. In 1971, East Pakistan seceded to form [[Bangladesh]] in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. In 1974, the remaining princely states of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] were abolished and their territories merged into [[Gilgit Agency]], to form the ''Northern Areas''. In 1975, portions of the districts of [[Peshawar]] and [[Dera Ismail Khan]] were separated to form the ''Federally Administered Tribal Areas''. In 1981, the region around Islamabad was separated from Punjab, and renamed to Islamabad Capital Territory.\n\nIn August 2000, divisions were abolished as part of a plan to restructure local government, followed by elections in 2001. Many of the functions previously handled by the provinces had been transferred to the districts and tehsils. In 2008, the government restored the former divisions and appointed commissioners.\n\nIn 2009, the Northern Areas were renamed to Gilgit-Baltistan and became a ''de facto'' province.<ref>{{cite news|title=Northern Areas renamed Gilgit-Baltistan Poll for assembly, CM in Nov Regional groups unhappy: Autonomy package for NAs approved|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/851176|work=DAWN|date=August 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Disputed Northern Areas renamed as Gilgit-Baltistan|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/world/disputed-northern-areas-renamed-as-gilgit-baltistan/story-qickZAJF82JoXg1CnzZJsJ.html|work=Hindustan Times|date=Aug 30, 2009}}</ref> In 2010, the Northwest Frontier Province was renamed to [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]].<ref>{{cite news|title=From NWFP to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/854215|work=DAWN|date=April 1, 2010}}</ref> In 2018, the National Assembly of Pakistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly passed the historic ''FATA Merger Bill'' - with the adoption of the ''[[Thirty-first Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Twenty-Fifth Amendment Act of 2018]]''.

The western wing consisted of the merger of [[North-West Frontier Province (1901\u20131955)|Northwest Frontier Province]], [[West Punjab]], and [[Sind Province (1936\u20131955)|Sindh]], the [[Baluchistan (Chief Commissioners Province)|Baluchistan Chief Commissioners Province]], thirteen [[princely state]]s. The eastern wing consisted of [[East Bengal]], the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] and [[Sylhet Division|Sylhet]] from the former [[Provinces of India|British Raj province]] of [[Assam]].\n\nIn 1948, [[Karachi]] was separated from Sindh to form the [[Federal Capital Territory (Pakistan)|Federal Capital Territory]]. In 1950, the Northwest Frontier Province absorbed the princely states of [[Amb (princely state)|Amb]] and [[Phulra (princely state)|Phulra]] while West Punjab renamed itself to Punjab. In 1952, the four princely states in the southwest formed the [[Baluchistan States Union]].\n\nIn 1955, the ''[[One Unit]] Policy'' was launched by [[Muhammad Ali Bogra]], whereby all the provinces and princely states of the western wing were merged and formed [[West Pakistan]], with [[Lahore]] as the provincial capital. Simultaneously, East Bengal (including Sylhet and the Hill Tracts) was renamed to [[East Pakistan]], with [[Dacca]] as the provincial capital. The One Unit Policy aimed to reduce expenditure and to eliminate provincial prejudices, but the military coup of 1958 signaled difficulties when the first military President, [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]], abolished the office of Chief Minister of West Pakistan in favour of Governor's rule.\n\nOn 7 September 1958, after four years of negotiations, including six months of intense negotiations, Pakistan purchased the [[Gwadar]] enclave from the [[Sultanate of Muscat and Oman|government of Oman]] for 5.5 billion rupees/ USD $3 million (approx. $22,410,311.42 in 2017). Gwadar formally became part of Pakistan on 8 December 1958 after 174 years of Omani rule. In 1960, the federal capital moved from Karachi to [[Rawalpindi]] and in 1961, the Federal Capital Territory was merged into West Pakistan. In 1966, the capital was again moved to [[Islamabad]]. In 1962, [[Dacca]] was made the legislative capital of the country due to [[East Pakistan]]'s high population.<ref>{{cite book|title=Pakistan Affairs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFIdAQAAMAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Information Division, Embassy of Pakistan.|page=19}}</ref> In 1963, Pakistan entered into a treaty with China to transfer part of the Gilgit Agency to China (Shaksgam Valley\u2014the Trans-Karakoram Tract) with the provision that the settlement was subject to the final solution of the Kashmir dispute.\n\n===Since 1970===\nIn 1970, the second military President, [[Yahya Khan]], abolished West Pakistan and established four new provinces: Sindh, Balochistan, Northwest Frontier Province and Punjab. In 1971, East Pakistan seceded to form [[Bangladesh]] in the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]]. In 1974, the remaining princely states of [[Hunza (princely state)|Hunza]] and [[Nagar (princely state)|Nagar]] were abolished and their territories merged into [[Gilgit Agency]], to form the ''Northern Areas''. In 1975, portions of the districts of [[Peshawar]] and [[Dera Ismail Khan]] were separated to form the ''Federally Administered Tribal Areas''. In 1981, the region around Islamabad was separated from Punjab, and renamed to Islamabad Capital Territory.\n\nIn August 2000, divisions were abolished as part of a plan to restructure local government, followed by elections in 2001. Many of the functions previously handled by the provinces had been transferred to the districts and tehsils. In 2008, the government restored the former divisions and appointed commissioners.\n\nIn 2009, the Northern Areas were renamed to Gilgit-Baltistan and became a ''de facto'' province.<ref>{{cite news|title=Northern Areas renamed Gilgit-Baltistan Poll for assembly, CM in Nov Regional groups unhappy: Autonomy package for NAs approved|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/851176|work=DAWN|date=August 30, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Disputed Northern Areas renamed as Gilgit-Baltistan|url=https://www.hindustantimes.com/world/disputed-northern-areas-renamed-as-gilgit-baltistan/story-qickZAJF82JoXg1CnzZJsJ.html|work=Hindustan Times|date=Aug 30, 2009}}</ref> In 2010, the Northwest Frontier Province was renamed to [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]].<ref>{{cite news|title=From NWFP to Khyber Pakhtunkhwa|url=https://www.dawn.com/news/854215|work=DAWN|date=April 1, 2010}}</ref> In 2018, the National Assembly of Pakistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly passed the historic ''FATA Merger Bill'' - with the adoption of the ''[[Thirty-first Amendment to the Constitution of Pakistan|Twenty-Fifth Amendment Act of 2018]]''.
