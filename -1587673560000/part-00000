The [[observatory]] was established in 1945 by [[Bernard Lovell]], a radio astronomer at the University of Manchester to investigate [[cosmic ray]]s after his work on [[radar]] during the Second World War. It has since played an important role in the research of [[meteor]]s, [[quasar]]s, [[pulsar]]s, [[astrophysical maser|masers]] and [[gravitational lens]]es, and was heavily involved with the tracking of [[space probe]]s at the start of the [[Space Age]]. The managing director of the observatory is Professor Simon Garrington.\n\nThe main telescope at the observatory is the [[Lovell Telescope]], which is the third largest steerable radio telescope in the world. There are three other active telescopes at the observatory; the [[Mark II (radio telescope)|Mark II]], and {{convert|42|ft|m|abbr=on}} and 7&nbsp;m diameter radio telescopes.

It is named from a nearby rise in the ground, Jodrell Bank, which was named after [[William Jauderell]], whose descendants lived at the [[mansion]] that is now Terra Nova School. The site was extended in 1952 by the purchase of a farm from George Massey on which the [[Lovell Telescope]] was built.<ref name=\"story_jb\">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank''</ref>\n\nThe site was first used for [[astrophysics]] in 1945, when Bernard Lovell used some equipment left over from [[World War II]], including a [[gun laying]] [[radar]], to investigate [[cosmic ray]]s.<ref name=\"story_2\">Lovell, ''The Story of Jodrell Bank'', p. 2</ref> The equipment was a GL II radar system working at a wavelength of 4.2&nbsp;m, provided by [[J.

The observatory has been involved in the construction of several [[Cosmic Microwave Background]] experiments, including the [[Tenerife Experiment]], which ran from the 1980s to 2000, and the amplifiers and cryostats for the [[Very Small Array]].<ref name=\"vsa_cryostats\">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/tech/technology/vsa.html | title=JBO\u2014VSA Receivers | accessdate=2007-06-23|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory}}</ref> It has also constructed the front-end modules of the 30 and 44&nbsp;GHz receivers for the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck spacecraft]].<ref name=\"jb_bigbang\">{{cite web | url=http://www.jb.man.ac.uk/booklet/BigBang.html | title=Jodrell Bank\u2014Observing the Big Bang | accessdate=2007-06-10|publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory}}</ref> Receivers were also designed at Jodrell Bank for the [[Parkes Observatory|Parkes Telescope]] in Australia.<ref name=\"jodrellbank_anatomy\">{{cite web | url=http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/lovell/anatomy.html | title=Jodrell Bank\u2014Anatomy of a Radio Telescope | accessdate=2007-06-10 | publisher=Jodrell Bank Observatory | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081016100922/http://www.jodrellbank.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/lovell/anatomy.html | archivedate=16 October 2008 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Visitor facilities, and events==\n[[Image:Jodrell.Bank.Telescope.From.Arboretum.JPG|thumb|A view of the telescope from the Arboretum]]\n[[File:Aa Jodrellbank newbldg 00.jpg|thumb|New visitor's centre being constructed at Jodrell Bank in March 2011]]\n\nA visitors' centre opened on 19 April 1971 by the [[Duke of Devonshire]],<ref name=\"zenith\">Lovell, ''Out of the Zenith''</ref> attracted around 120,000 visitors per year.

The regressive phase of sea level is represented by the [[Komorowo Beds]] and\nUpper Slawecin Beds along with the Drzewica Formation.

The coagulation can be caused by adding [[rennet]] or any edible [[acid]]ic substance such as [[lemon juice]] or [[vinegar]], and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins ([[casein]]) to tangle into solid masses, or ''curds''. Milk that has been left to sour ([[raw milk]] alone or [[pasteurized milk]] with  will also naturally produce curds, and [[sour milk cheese]]s are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in [[cheesemaking]]; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only [[whey protein]]s, is the [[whey]]. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins.\n\nIn [[Indian English]], used only in the [[Indian subcontinent]], ''[[curd]]'' or ''curds'' instead refers to the traditional [[Yogurt#Homemade|homemade yogurt]] (also known as [[Dahi (Curd)|dahi]]<ref>Curd -[http://learningindia.in/references/indian-english-dictionary/ Indian English Dictionary])</ref>), while ''[[paneer]]'' and ''[[chhena]]'' are used to denote curdled milk.

The coagulation can be caused by adding [[rennet]] or any edible [[acid]]ic substance such as [[lemon juice]] or [[vinegar]], and then allowing it to coagulate. The increased acidity causes the milk proteins ([[casein]]) to tangle into solid masses, or ''curds''. Milk that has been left to sour ([[raw milk]] alone or [[pasteurized milk]] with added [[lactic acid bacteria]]) will also naturally produce curds, and [[sour milk cheese]]s are produced this way. Producing cheese curds is one of the first steps in [[cheesemaking]]; the curds are pressed and drained to varying amounts for different styles of cheese and different secondary agents (molds for blue cheeses, etc.) are introduced before the desired aging finishes the cheese. The remaining liquid, which contains only [[whey protein]]s, is the [[whey]]. In cow's milk, 90 percent of the proteins are caseins.\n\nIn [[Indian English]], used only in the [[Indian subcontinent]], ''[[curd]]'' or ''curds'' instead refers to the traditional [[Yogurt#Homemade|homemade yogurt]] (also known as [[Dahi (Curd)|dahi]]<ref>Curd -[http://learningindia.in/references/indian-english-dictionary/ Indian English Dictionary])</ref>), while ''[[paneer]]'' and ''[[chhena]]'' are used to denote curdled milk.

Critics cited the overuse of plot points, poorly produced [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and the 'out-of-place' science fiction elements.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Machete (character)|Machete Cortez]] ([[Danny Trejo]]) and Sartana Rivera ([[Jessica Alba]]) attempt to capture weapon dealers who have been supplying the [[Drug cartel#Mexico|Mexican drug cartels]]. The military men are then all killed by the gangsters, who in turn are wiped out by another intervening party. Its leader murders Sartana while Machete is arrested by corrupt Sheriff Doakes ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) and Deputy Clebourne (Samuel Davis). Doakes unsuccessfully tries to hang Machete but the [[President of the United States|President of the US]], Rathcock ([[Charlie Sheen]]), intervenes. Machete is brought to the [[White House]], where the president offers him US citizenship if he eliminates Marcos Mendez ([[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]]), a psychopath who is threatening to fire a nuclear missile at [[Washington, D.C.]] if the American government does not intervene to stop the rampant drug cartels in Mexico and the corruption of its government.\n\nMachete agrees and travels to [[San Antonio]], where he meets his handler Blanca Vasquez ([[Amber Heard]]), an undercover [[beauty pageant]] competitor. She sends him to [[Acapulco]] to meet a young woman, Cereza ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]), who can lead him to Mendez. Machete finds her in a brothel run by her mother, Madame Desdemona ([[Sof\u00eda Vergara]]), who attempts to kill Machete before he escapes with Cereza. She takes him to Mendez's associate, Zaror ([[Marko Zaror]]), who kills Cereza before taking Machete to Mendez's base of operations.\n\nThere, Machete learns that Mendez has wired the missile's launch device to Mendez' heart and triggered its launch in 24 hours. If he dies, the missile fires. After Machete kills Zaror, he also captures Mendez, intending to escort Mendez to the US and find a way to disarm the missile. Machete learns that Mendez is an ex-secret agent who tried to expose his corrupt superiors, only to be betrayed and forced to watch his family being tortured. The trauma drove him insane, creating his split personalities and leading him to join forces with the missile's creator.\n\nShortly thereafter, a hit is put out on them. Machete is targeted by several assailants, including Madame Desdemona and her prostitute assassins, a [[shapeshifting]] hitman called El Camale\u00f3n, and Doakes. Machete and Mendez manage to reach the US and kill Doakes and Clebourne only to be caught by a reborn Zaror and the same mercenaries who killed Sartana. Zaror decapitates Mendez and Machete is riddled with bullets.\n\nMachete wakes up to find himself in a healing tank. He is taken to meet Zaror's benefactor\u2014corrupt businessman, inventor and ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan Luther Voz ([[Mel Gibson]]), who reveals Zaror is a series of cloned warriors. He shows Machete Mendez's beating heart, preserved in a jar, and informs him of his plan to manipulate extremists throughout the world to detonate nuclear weapons while planning to escape in a spaceship to rebuild society in space. Machete then escapes with help from Luz ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), who had heard about the hit on Machete. She informs him that the only one who can disarm Mendez's heart is Machete's old enemy, Osiris Amanpour ([[Tom Savini]]), who had repented and joined Luz's Network. Machete contacts Vasquez, who instructs him to meet her at a rendezvous point.\n\nArriving there, Machete is betrayed and ambushed by Vasquez, who is in league with Voz. As she is escaping into the desert, Machete gives chase and jumps onto the top of her vehicle but falls off after gunfire comes through the roof. Machete is then given a ride by El Camale\u00f3n, who tries to kill him one last time, but he escapes and El Camale\u00f3n ends up being shot to death by a group of racist [[rednecks]] just inside the US border. Machete then reunites with Luz and the Network. They infiltrate a fundraiser at Voz's base of operations, where Voz kills Osiris. Machete realizes Voz was the one who killed Sartana and fights him. He severely burns Voz's face, disfiguring him to the extent that Voz is forced to wear a metallic, silver mask. Meanwhile, Vasquez shoots Luz in her good eye, completely blinding her. Luz kills Vasquez in return but is captured by Voz, frozen in Carbonite and taken aboard his ship.\n\nMachete jumps on the missile as it launches and disarms it in mid-air, while Voz boards the ship and departs with the Zaror clones, his supporters, as well as Luz and the surviving Network members who will be used as slave labor. The disarmed missile then plunges into the [[Rio Grande]] and Machete is rescued by President Rathcock, who asks him to follow Voz into space and kill him. Machete agrees and uses a [[SpaceX]] [[Falcon 9 v1.0]] rocket to depart to Voz's Station in Earth's orbit, where he is given a laser machete to start his mission.\n\nIn a [[post-credits scene]], an [[outtake]] from the Luz and Blanca fight scene is included followed by a shot of President Rathcock in front of a space background inquisitively brandishing two of Voz's guns (the molecular disruptor and the same pistol used to kill Sartana) before firing wildly at an off-screen target.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=30em|\n* [[Danny Trejo]] as [[Machete (character)|Machete Cortez]]\n* [[Michelle Rodriguez]] as Luz / Sh\u00e9<ref name=\"http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/56813/machete-kills-cast-gets-double-dose-hot-electra-and-elise-avellan /\">{{cite web |url=https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/56813/machete-kills-cast-gets-double-dose-hot-electra-and-elise-avellan | title=Machete Kills Cast Gets a Double Dose of Hot with Electra and Elise Avellan |accessdate=July 21, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Mel Gibson]] as Luther Voz<ref name=\"http://collider.com/mel-gibson-machete-2-sequel/161435/\">{{cite web | url=https://collider.com/mel-gibson-machete-2-sequel/161435/ | title=Mel Gibson Joins Robert Rodriguez's MACHETE KILLS | accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Sof\u00eda Vergara]] as Madame Desdemona<ref name=\"http://movies.ign.com/articles/122/1224420p1.html\">{{cite web | url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/122/1224420p1.html | title=Sofia Vergara Joins Machete Kills | accessdate=June 21, 2012 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611103846/http://movies.ign.com/articles/122/1224420p1.html | archivedate=June 11, 2012 }}</ref>\n* [[Amber Heard]] as Blanca Vasquez / Miss San Antonio<ref name=\"http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118053481\">{{cite web | url=https://www.variety.com/article/VR1118053481 | title=Amber Heard swings 'Machete Kills' | accessdate=June 21, 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]] as Marcos Mendez<ref name=\"http://collider.com/demian-bichir-machete-kills-trapped-star-trek-2/163573/\">{{cite web | url=https://collider.com/demian-bichir-machete-kills-trapped-star-trek-2/163573/ | title=Demian Bichir Joins MACHETE KILLS and William Friedkin's TRAPPED;

Critics cited the overuse of plot points, poorly produced [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]], and the 'out-of-place' science fiction elements.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Machete (character)|Machete Cortez]] ([[Danny Trejo]]) and Sartana Rivera ([[Jessica Alba]]) attempt to capture weapon dealers who have been supplying the [[Drug cartel#Mexico|Mexican drug cartels]]. The military men are then all killed by the gangsters, who in turn are wiped out by another intervening party. Its leader murders Sartana while Machete is arrested by corrupt Sheriff Doakes ([[William Sadler (actor)|William Sadler]]) and Deputy Clebourne (Samuel Davis). Doakes unsuccessfully tries to hang Machete but the [[President of the United States|President of the US]], Rathcock ([[Charlie Sheen]]), intervenes. Machete is brought to the [[White House]], where the president offers him US citizenship if he eliminates Marcos Mendez ([[Demi\u00e1n Bichir]]), a psychopath who is threatening to fire a nuclear missile at [[Washington, D.C.]] if the American government does not intervene to stop the rampant drug cartels in Mexico and the corruption of its government.\n\nMachete agrees and travels to [[San Antonio]], where he meets his handler Blanca Vasquez ([[Amber Heard]]), an undercover [[beauty pageant]] competitor. She sends him to [[Acapulco]] to meet a young woman, Cereza ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]), who can lead him to Mendez. Machete finds her in a brothel run by her mother, Madame Desdemona ([[Sof\u00eda Vergara]]), who attempts to kill Machete before he escapes with Cereza. She takes him to Mendez's associate, Zaror ([[Marko Zaror]]), who kills Cereza before taking Machete to Mendez's base of operations.\n\nThere, Machete learns that Mendez has wired the missile's launch device to Mendez' heart and triggered its launch in 24 hours. If he dies, the missile fires. After Machete kills Zaror, he also captures Mendez, intending to escort Mendez to the US and find a way to disarm the missile. Machete learns that Mendez is an ex-secret agent who tried to expose his corrupt superiors, only to be betrayed and forced to watch his family being tortured. The trauma drove him insane, creating his split personalities and leading him to join forces with the missile's creator.\n\nShortly thereafter, a hit is put out on them. Machete is targeted by several assailants, including Madame Desdemona and her prostitute assassins, a [[shapeshifting]] hitman called El Camale\u00f3n, and Doakes. Machete and Mendez manage to reach the US and kill Doakes and Clebourne only to be caught by a reborn Zaror and the same mercenaries who killed Sartana. Zaror decapitates Mendez and Machete is riddled with bullets.\n\nMachete wakes up to find himself in a healing tank. He is taken to meet Zaror's benefactor\u2014corrupt businessman, inventor and ''[[Star Wars]]'' fan Luther Voz ([[Mel Gibson]]), who reveals Zaror is a series of cloned warriors. He shows Machete Mendez's beating heart, preserved in a jar, and informs him of his plan to manipulate extremists throughout the world to detonate nuclear weapons while planning to escape in a spaceship to rebuild society in space. Machete then escapes with help from Luz ([[Michelle Rodriguez]]), who had heard about the hit on Machete. She informs him that the only one who can disarm Mendez's heart is Machete's old enemy, Osiris Amanpour ([[Tom Savini]]), who had repented and joined Luz's Network. Machete contacts Vasquez, who instructs him to meet her at a rendezvous point.\n\nArriving there, Machete is betrayed and ambushed by Vasquez, who is in league with Voz. As she is escaping into the desert, Machete gives chase and jumps onto the top of her vehicle but falls off after gunfire comes through the roof. Machete is then given a ride by El Camale\u00f3n, who tries to kill him one last time, but he escapes and El Camale\u00f3n ends up being shot to death by a group of racist [[rednecks]] just inside the US border. Machete then reunites with Luz and the Network. They infiltrate a fundraiser at Voz's base of operations, where Voz kills Osiris. Machete realizes Voz was the one who killed Sartana and fights him. He severely burns Voz's face, disfiguring him to the extent that Voz is forced to wear a metallic, silver mask. Meanwhile, Vasquez shoots Luz in her good eye, completely blinding her. Luz kills Vasquez in return but is captured by Voz, frozen in Carbonite and taken aboard his ship.\n\nMachete jumps on the missile as it launches and disarms it in mid-air, while Voz boards the ship and departs with the Zaror clones, his supporters, as well as Luz and the surviving Network members who will be used as slave labor.
