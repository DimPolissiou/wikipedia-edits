It was sold in the [[United States|U.S.]], [[Canada]], and parts of [[People's Republic of China|China]] under Honda's luxury brand, [[Acura]], from 1985 to 1995, as both a [[sedan (car)|sedan]], which was classified as a [[full-size car]], and a [[coupe]], which was classified as a [[mid-size car]] (similar to how the [[Honda Accord]] is set up today). It was the first flagship sedan sold under the [[Acura]] nameplate, until being renamed in 1996 as the [[Acura RL|Acura 3.5RL]]. The 3.5RL was the North American version of the KA9 series Honda Legend.\n\nThe opportunity for Japanese manufacturers to export more expensive models had arisen with the 1980s [[voluntary export restraint]]s, negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives, restricting mainstream car sales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=xix, 28}}</ref> The initial success of the Legend and Honda's Acura division in competing against established European and American luxury manufacturers would lead to Toyota and Nissan creating the [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] brands, respectively, to compete in the luxury car market.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation (1985\u20131990)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=First generation\n|image=1st-Acura-Legend.jpg\n|caption=1988 Acura Legend \"LS\" sedan \n|production=1985&ndash;1990 KA1-6 chassis\n|layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n|engine=2.5 L ''[[Honda C engine#C25A|C25A]]'' [[V6]]<br />2.7 L ''[[Honda C engine#C27A|C27A]]'' [[V6]]\n|transmission=5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase=Sedan: {{convert|108.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|106.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length=1985-88 Sedan: {{convert|189.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|188|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}<br />1989-1990 Sedan: {{convert|190.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width=1989-1990 Sedan: {{convert|68.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1986-88 Sedan: {{convert|68.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|68.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height=Sedan: {{convert|54.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|53.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|related=  [[Rover 800|Rover 800-series]]<br />[[Sterling (car)|Sterling 825/827]]\n|designer = Tetsuya Mizuno, Yukio Kurosu, Yoshio Ui (1982, 1984)\n}}\n\nHonda introduced the model in [[Japan]] on October 22, 1985, to be their premier luxury model, and in [[North America]] for the 1986 model year, as the top of the line model for its then-new [[Acura]] lineup. Sedan models came to the market first, powered by a {{Convert|151|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.5&nbsp;L [[Honda C engine#C25A|C25A]] [[V6]], with coupes making their first appearance in 1987, powered by a new {{Convert|161|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.7&nbsp;L [[Honda C engine#C27A|C27A]] engine. Sedans received the new engine for 1988.\n\nThe Legend was the first production Honda vehicle to offer a [[V6]] engine. The Legend was a result of a joint venture with Britain's [[Austin Rover Group]] called Project XX that started in November 1981 with the Austin Rover-Honda XX letter of intent signed by the two companies to replace the [[Rover SD1]] and to provide a luxury vehicle for Honda. The [[Rover Company]] had a long established reputation as a luxury car in the United Kingdom and Europe, demonstrated with the [[Rover P6]], and Honda wanted to introduce a luxury car for both domestic Japanese and the United States markets. The joint development produced the Legend and the corresponding British version was the [[Rover 800|Rover 800-series]], which was badged under the [[Sterling (car)|Sterling]] brand in the United States and competed with the Legend.\n\n[[File:1990 Acura Legend L, rear left.jpg|thumb|left|1990 Acura Legend L (US)]]\n\nRover also wanted to return to the American market when they had reportedly sold only 1,500 cars in 1971, and a brief return in 1980, selling 800 Rover SD1s by offering the Sterling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?xxstoryf.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003054246/http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?xxstoryf.htm |archivedate=2011-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe Legend won ''[[Car and Driver]]''<nowiki/>'s ''Ten Best'' three years in a row and ''[[Motor Trend]]''<nowiki/>'s ''Import Car of the Year'' for 1987. Manual-equipped models could accelerate from 0-{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in under 8 seconds and reach a top speed of {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Sedan models had a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.32, while coupes were only 0.30.\n\nWhen the Legend was introduced, Honda's newly established luxury car division just for the Legend was called Acura, using the advertising slogan \"Precision Crafted Performance\", and the Legend was offered with one factory installed option, the choice of transmission used, and one trim level. In the 1986 sales brochure, the Legend's full name used was \"Legend Touring Sedan\". The vehicle was virtually identical in luxury content to the Japanese market V6Zi, but was identical in size and the longer overall length of the top level V6Xi to comply with United States crash standards, using the larger 2.5 V6 engine. The [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] supplied 80W four speaker [[cassette tape]] stereo offered four user programmable equalizer settings, and was equipped with a dual diversity antenna, meaning it had a conventional extendable power antenna and an embedded antenna in the rear window. One of the novelty items was a simple volume control rocker switch and a pre-set radio station channel selector installed on the instrument binnacle within reach of the right hand; the opposite side of the instrument binnacle had a button to open, tilt or close the standard equipped glass [[moonroof]] with sun shade.\n\nThe North American Legend was not offered with some of the items offered in Japan, such as automatic, one touch climate control, and 100% wool cloth interior in brown. Blue interior was shared with Japan and North America, but brown was not offered in North America, and \"sand gray\" was offered instead. Exterior colors were matched to only one interior color choice and leather was not offered. Due to the success Honda had with the Legend, it served as an inspiration for the [[Subaru Legacy (first generation)|Subaru Legacy]] with which it shares many visual resemblances and dimensions both inside and out.\n\n[[File:1990 Acura Legend Coupe 2013.9.9.jpg|thumb|left|Acura Legend coupe]]\n\nIn late 1988 for the 1989 model year, the sedan received some minor tweaks, upgrading to the one-piece front headlamps already in use in Japan since the 1985 introduction, a revised front bumper, trunk lid, tail light cluster, and an upgraded double-wishbone rear suspension, with a new alloy wheel appearance. By that time all Legends came equipped with a Honda-designed 4-wheel anti-lock brake system. Other features such as power driver's seat memory for 3 positions were added. High-end LS models featured a driver's-side airbag, trip computer, electronic vehicle monitoring system in the center console and a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system. It was also joined by the [[Acura Vigor]] which set the stage for the larger second generation Legend introduced October 1990.<ref>http://www.hondanews.com/channels/acura-automobiles/archive/1989/releases/1989-acura-legend-specifications</ref>\n\nFor the 1990 model year, all Legends came with body-colored side mirrors.  Legend coupes had a revised body-colored front grille, new red & clear tail lights, and improved front seats.  LS model coupes also received a trunk-mounted lip spoiler. All LS models featured burlwood interior trim. Production of the first generation models ended in 1990 as a second generation version became available for the 1991 model year. At least by the 1990 model year, the fuel filler door on the sedan had been moved rearward about {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom the exterior, there are only superficial similarities between the Legend and its Rover 800/Sterling cousin.  Both cars share the 2.5L and 2.7L Honda engine with {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 4-speed automatic transmission. The core structure and chassis design is also common to both cars, however the Rover version has its own exterior panelwork, interior and electrical systems. The Rover was also offered with a 2.0L in-line 4-cylinder engines in tune with European tastes, however the Legend was only available with V6 power regardless of market. In Japan only, Honda installed a turbocharger with variable geometry in the Legend with the smaller 2.0 L V6, called the [[Honda Legend#\"Wing Turbo\" version|\"Wing Turbo\"]] for model year 1989.\n\n==Second generation (1990\u20131995)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Second generation\n|image=Acura-Legend-Coupe.jpg\n| caption=2nd-gen Acura Legend coupe\n|production=1990&ndash;1995 KA7/KA8 - chassis\n|layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Longitudinal front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n|engine=3.2 L ''[[Honda C engine#C32A|C32A]]'' [[V6]]\n|transmission=5-speed manual<br />4-speed automatic<br />6-speed manual\n|wheelbase=Coupe: {{convert|111.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Sedan: {{convert|114.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length=Sedan: {{convert|194.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|192.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width={{convert|71.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height=1990-92 Coupe: {{convert|53.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Sedan: {{convert|55.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1993-95 Coupe: {{convert|53.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|designer=Yusuke Saitoh (1988)<ref>{{cite web|title=Automobile|url=https://www.google.com.ar/patents/USD327239}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:2nd Legend Coupe.JPG|thumb|left|Acura Legend coupe (US)]]\n[[File:91 Acura Legend (13174599143).jpg|thumb|left|1991 Acura Legend (US)]]\n\nSecond generation units became available October 24, 1990, now using a {{Convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} SOHC ([[Honda C engine#C32A|C32A]]) engine mated to either a standard 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or an optional 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]]. The second generation Legend was a larger, more streamlined-looking car (drag coefficients were actually higher at 0.34 for sedans and 0.32 for coupes).

The segment the Legend originally filled was now being served by the [[Acura Vigor]] which allowed the Legend to position itself more towards the rear drive Lexus LS and the Infiniti Q45 sedans.

Honda made significant upgrades for 1993, making a {{Convert|230|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ''Type II'' version of the SOHC C32A engine standard on all coupes, along with the option of a 6-speed manual transmission (for coupes only, initially).<ref name=\"S&ExC\"/> The LS version of the sedan lost the option for a manual transmission and was only available with an automatic transmission from then on. 1993 also saw the addition of dual airbags as standard equipment in all trims, the deletion of the black molding on the entry level cars, and a new wheel design with fewer spokes on the sedans (16-spoke vs. 20-spoke). To reach the higher output, the Type II engine has bigger intake valves, a higher lift camshaft, and an exhaust with freer flow.<ref name=\"S&ExC\"/>\n\nFor the 1994\u201395 model years, all Legends received new front bumper and trunk lid designs, a new front grille (L & LS Sedans only), and a power tilt-telescoping steering column; the word \"Legend\" was now spelled out in individual letters on the back. The base sedan was dropped, while a new GS sedan became the new top-line variant, sporting the {{Convert|230|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} ''Type II'' engine, upgraded brakes from the coupe, sport suspension from the coupe, a body-colored version of the 1991 to 1993 grille, the same standard 6-speed manual transmission found on the coupes as well as the special 16 inch 5-spoke LS Coupe wheels (better known as ''GS Wheels'').

It was the first flagship sedan sold under the [[Acura]] nameplate, until being renamed in 1996 as the [[Acura RL|Acura 3.5RL]]. The 3.5RL was the North American version of the KA9 series Honda Legend.\n\nThe opportunity for Japanese manufacturers to export more expensive models had arisen with the 1980s [[voluntary export restraint]]s, negotiated by the Japanese government and U.S. trade representatives, restricting mainstream car sales.<ref>{{Harvnb|Dawson|2004|pp=xix, 28}}</ref> The initial success of the Legend and Honda's Acura division in competing against established European and American luxury manufacturers would lead to Toyota and Nissan creating the [[Lexus]] and [[Infiniti]] brands, respectively, to compete in the luxury car market.\n\n{{TOC left}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==First generation (1985\u20131990)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=First generation\n|image=1st-Acura-Legend.jpg\n|caption=1988 Acura Legend \"LS\" sedan \n|production=1985&ndash;1990 KA1-6 chassis\n|layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Transverse front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n|engine=2.5 L ''[[Honda C engine#C25A|C25A]]'' [[V6]]<br />2.7 L ''[[Honda C engine#C27A|C27A]]'' [[V6]]\n|transmission=5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]\n|wheelbase=Sedan: {{convert|108.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|106.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length=1985-88 Sedan: {{convert|189.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|188|in|mm|1|abbr=on}}<br />1989-1990 Sedan: {{convert|190.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width=1989-1990 Sedan: {{convert|68.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1986-88 Sedan: {{convert|68.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|68.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height=Sedan: {{convert|54.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|53.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|related=  [[Rover 800|Rover 800-series]]<br />[[Sterling (car)|Sterling 825/827]]\n|designer = Tetsuya Mizuno, Yukio Kurosu, Yoshio Ui (1982, 1984)\n}}\n\nHonda introduced the model in [[Japan]] on October 22, 1985, to be their premier luxury model, and in [[North America]] for the 1986 model year, as the top of the line model for its then-new [[Acura]] lineup. Sedan models came to the market first, powered by a {{Convert|151|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.5&nbsp;L [[Honda C engine#C25A|C25A]] [[V6]], with coupes making their first appearance in 1987, powered by a new {{Convert|161|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} 2.7&nbsp;L [[Honda C engine#C27A|C27A]] engine. Sedans received the new engine for 1988.\n\nThe Legend was the first production Honda vehicle to offer a [[V6]] engine. The Legend was a result of a joint venture with Britain's [[Austin Rover Group]] called Project XX that started in November 1981 with the Austin Rover-Honda XX letter of intent signed by the two companies to replace the [[Rover SD1]] and to provide a luxury vehicle for Honda. The [[Rover Company]] had a long established reputation as a luxury car in the United Kingdom and Europe, demonstrated with the [[Rover P6]], and Honda wanted to introduce a luxury car for both domestic Japanese and the United States markets. The joint development produced the Legend and the corresponding British version was the [[Rover 800|Rover 800-series]], which was badged under the [[Sterling (car)|Sterling]] brand in the United States and competed with the Legend.\n\n[[File:1990 Acura Legend L, rear left.jpg|thumb|left|1990 Acura Legend L (US)]]\n\nRover also wanted to return to the American market when they had reportedly sold only 1,500 cars in 1971, and a brief return in 1980, selling 800 Rover SD1s by offering the Sterling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?xxstoryf.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003054246/http://www.aronline.co.uk/index.htm?xxstoryf.htm |archivedate=2011-10-03 }}</ref>\n\nThe Legend won ''[[Car and Driver]]''<nowiki/>'s ''Ten Best'' three years in a row and ''[[Motor Trend]]''<nowiki/>'s ''Import Car of the Year'' for 1987. Manual-equipped models could accelerate from 0-{{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in under 8 seconds and reach a top speed of {{convert|135|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. Sedan models had a [[drag coefficient]] of 0.32, while coupes were only 0.30.\n\nWhen the Legend was introduced, Honda's newly established luxury car division just for the Legend was called Acura, using the advertising slogan \"Precision Crafted Performance\", and the Legend was offered with one factory installed option, the choice of transmission used, and one trim level. In the 1986 sales brochure, the Legend's full name used was \"Legend Touring Sedan\". The vehicle was virtually identical in luxury content to the Japanese market V6Zi, but was identical in size and the longer overall length of the top level V6Xi to comply with United States crash standards, using the larger 2.5 V6 engine. The [[Technics (brand)|Technics]] supplied 80W four speaker [[cassette tape]] stereo offered four user programmable equalizer settings, and was equipped with a dual diversity antenna, meaning it had a conventional extendable power antenna and an embedded antenna in the rear window. One of the novelty items was a simple volume control rocker switch and a pre-set radio station channel selector installed on the instrument binnacle within reach of the right hand; the opposite side of the instrument binnacle had a button to open, tilt or close the standard equipped glass [[moonroof]] with sun shade.\n\nThe North American Legend was not offered with some of the items offered in Japan, such as automatic, one touch climate control, and 100% wool cloth interior in brown. Blue interior was shared with Japan and North America, but brown was not offered in North America, and \"sand gray\" was offered instead. Exterior colors were matched to only one interior color choice and leather was not offered. Due to the success Honda had with the Legend, it served as an inspiration for the [[Subaru Legacy (first generation)|Subaru Legacy]] with which it shares many visual resemblances and dimensions both inside and out.\n\n[[File:1990 Acura Legend Coupe 2013.9.9.jpg|thumb|left|Acura Legend coupe]]\n\nIn late 1988 for the 1989 model year, the sedan received some minor tweaks, upgrading to the one-piece front headlamps already in use in Japan since the 1985 introduction, a revised front bumper, trunk lid, tail light cluster, and an upgraded double-wishbone rear suspension, with a new alloy wheel appearance. By that time all Legends came equipped with a Honda-designed 4-wheel anti-lock brake system. Other features such as power driver's seat memory for 3 positions were added. High-end LS models featured a driver's-side airbag, trip computer, electronic vehicle monitoring system in the center console and a [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system. It was also joined by the [[Acura Vigor]] which set the stage for the larger second generation Legend introduced October 1990.<ref>http://www.hondanews.com/channels/acura-automobiles/archive/1989/releases/1989-acura-legend-specifications</ref>\n\nFor the 1990 model year, all Legends came with body-colored side mirrors.  Legend coupes had a revised body-colored front grille, new red & clear tail lights, and improved front seats.  LS model coupes also received a trunk-mounted lip spoiler. All LS models featured burlwood interior trim. Production of the first generation models ended in 1990 as a second generation version became available for the 1991 model year. At least by the 1990 model year, the fuel filler door on the sedan had been moved rearward about {{convert|15|cm|in|abbr=on}}.\n\nFrom the exterior, there are only superficial similarities between the Legend and its Rover 800/Sterling cousin.  Both cars share the 2.5L and 2.7L Honda engine with {{Convert|160|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and a 4-speed automatic transmission. The core structure and chassis design is also common to both cars, however the Rover version has its own exterior panelwork, interior and electrical systems. The Rover was also offered with a 2.0L in-line 4-cylinder engines in tune with European tastes, however the Legend was only available with V6 power regardless of market. In Japan only, Honda installed a turbocharger with variable geometry in the Legend with the smaller 2.0 L V6, called the [[Honda Legend#\"Wing Turbo\" version|\"Wing Turbo\"]] for model year 1989.\n\n==Second generation (1990\u20131995)==\n{{Infobox automobile\n|name=Second generation\n|image=Acura-Legend-Coupe.jpg\n| caption=2nd-gen Acura Legend coupe\n|production=1990&ndash;1995 KA7/KA8 - chassis\n|layout= [[Front-engine, front-wheel-drive layout|Longitudinal front-engine, front-wheel drive]]\n|engine=3.2 L ''[[Honda C engine#C32A|C32A]]'' [[V6]]\n|transmission=5-speed manual<br />4-speed automatic<br />6-speed manual\n|wheelbase=Coupe: {{convert|111.4|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Sedan: {{convert|114.6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|length=Sedan: {{convert|194.9|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Coupe: {{convert|192.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|width={{convert|71.3|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|height=1990-92 Coupe: {{convert|53.5|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />Sedan: {{convert|55.1|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}<br />1993-95 Coupe: {{convert|53.7|in|mm|0|abbr=on}}\n|designer=Yusuke Saitoh (1988)<ref>{{cite web|title=Automobile|url=https://www.google.com.ar/patents/USD327239}}</ref>\n}}\n[[File:2nd Legend Coupe.JPG|thumb|left|Acura Legend coupe (US)]]\n[[File:91 Acura Legend (13174599143).jpg|thumb|left|1991 Acura Legend (US)]]\n\nSecond generation units became available October 24, 1990, now using a {{Convert|200|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} SOHC ([[Honda C engine#C32A|C32A]]) engine mated to either a standard 5-speed [[Manual transmission|manual]] or an optional 4-speed [[Automatic transmission|automatic]].

Her research subjects include quality of employment, multidimensional indicators, Latin American labour markets, labour relations, Chilean politics and public policy. \n\n== Research ==\nSehnbruch has consistently worked on the subject of the quality of employment. Her work argues that employment conditions such as income levels, job stability, occupational status, social security contributions, and access to quality vocational training are extremely important to an individual's capabilities and well-being. Still, these conditions are often neglected by labour market experts and policy makers, who tend to focus mostly on the quantity of available jobs.<ref>Sehnbruch. 2006.

Sehnbruch studied modern and medieval languages at [[Jesus College, Cambridge]]. During her undergraduate degree, she worked as a trainee auditor for [[PricewaterhouseCoopers|Price Waterhouse]] in [[Buenos Aires]], where she gained first-hand experience of development issues. After graduating from Cambridge, she worked as an equity analyst for [[Goldman Sachs|Goldman Sachs Asset Management]] in London.\n\nIn 1997, she moved to [[Brussels]] to work at the [[European Commission]] on the Mexico Desk of the [[Directorate-General for External Relations (European Commission)|Directorate-General for External Relations]] with the team that negotiated the Global Agreement on Free Trade with [[Mexico]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Facultad de Econom\u00eda y Negocios Universidad de Chile |title=Acad\u00e9micos: Kirsten Sehnbruch |url=http://www.econ.uchile.cl/es/academico/ksehnbruch |website= |accessdate=17 March 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150621023257/http://www.econ.uchile.cl/es/academico/ksehnbruch |archivedate=21 June 2015 }}</ref> That year, she also returned to the [[University of Cambridge]] to undertake a Masters in Philosophy (MPhil) in Latin American Studies, focussing on economics and sociology.\n\nShe subsequently undertook a PhD in social and political sciences at the [[University of Cambridge]], which analysed the quality of employment in the Chilean labour market, and was published as the book ''[https://www.palgrave.com/gp/book/9781403972309 The Chilean Labor Market: A Key to understanding Latin American Labor Markets]'' by [[Palgrave Macmillan]] in 2006.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Palgrave Macmillan|title=The Chilean Labor Market: A key to understanding Latin American labor markets|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/the-chilean-labor-market-kirsten-sehnbruch-sehnbruch/?K=9781403972309}}</ref>\n\nFollowing her PhD, Sehnbruch worked as a lecturer and senior scholar at the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California at Berkeley]]. In 2009, she moved to Chile where she worked at the Faculty of Economics of the [[University of Chile|Universidad de Chile]] and as director of the Institute for Public Policy at the [[Universidad Diego Portales]]. During this time, Sehnbruch was instrumental in co-ordinating a significant grant from the Chilean government to set up a research hub on social conflict and cohesion (''[[:es:Centro_para_el_Estudio_del_Conflicto_y_la_Cohesi\u00f3n_Social|Centro de Estudios de Conflicto y Cohesi\u00f3n Social]]'')<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.coes.cl/|title=COES \u2013 Centro de Estudios de Conflicto y Cohesi\u00f3n Social|language=es-ES|accessdate=18 July 2019}}</ref>, based at the [[University of Chile]] and the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Chile|Catholic University of Chile]]. COES undertakes multidisciplinary research on subjects related to social conflict and cohesion in Chile. It brings together a group of more than 50 researchers from all social science disciplines as well as a network of international researchers from around the world. Sehnbruch was a member of the COES board for five years.\n\nSehnbruch has consistently worked on the subject of the quality of employment in developing countries. Her work conceptualises and measures the quality of employment using the theoretical framework of [[Amartya Sen]]'s capability approach and the empirical methodology developed by [[Sabina Alkire]] and [[James Foster (economist)|James Foster]]. Her work argues that measuring the performance of a developing country's labour market by focusing only on the ''quantity'' of jobs, as expressed by its unemployment rate, is as simplistic as measuring a country's level of development only by its GDP per capita level. More sophisticated, multidimensional measures are required that focus on the ''quality'' of jobs.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n== Media ==\nFor several years, Sehnbruch wrote a blog for one of Chile's principal newspapers, [[La Tercera|''La Tercera'']]. She maintains an active profile in the Chilean press, but has also written for [[The Guardian]], ''The [[Washington Post]]'''s ''Monkey Cage'', [[OpenDemocracy|Open Democracy]] and the [[Inter-American Dialogue]].\n\n== Selected publications ==\n=== Refereed journal articles ===\n*Sehnbruch, K., Gonz\u00e1lez, P., Apablaza, M., M\u00e9ndez Pineda, R., & Arriagada, V.

Sehnbruch was a member of the COES board for five years.\n\nSehnbruch has consistently worked on the subject of the quality of employment in developing countries. Her work conceptualises and measures the quality of employment using the theoretical framework of [[Amartya Sen]]'s capability approach and the empirical methodology developed by [[Sabina Alkire]] and [[James Foster (economist)|James Foster]]. Her work argues that measuring the performance of a developing country's labour market by focusing only on the ''quantity'' of jobs, as expressed by its unemployment rate, is as simplistic as measuring a country's level of development only by its GDP per capita level. More sophisticated, multidimensional measures are required that focus on the ''quality'' of jobs.\u00a0 \u00a0\n\n== Media ==\nFor several years, Sehnbruch wrote a blog for one of Chile's principal newspapers, [[La Tercera|''La Tercera'']]. She maintains an active profile in the Chilean press, but has also written for [[The Guardian]], ''The [[Washington Post]]'''s ''Monkey Cage'', [[OpenDemocracy|Open Democracy]] and the [[Inter-American Dialogue]].\n\n== Selected publications ==\n=== Refereed journal articles ===\n*Sehnbruch, K., Gonz\u00e1lez, P., Apablaza, M., M\u00e9ndez Pineda, R., & Arriagada, V.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked by the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades.

[[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment. Seabee Naval Training Centers were named for former heads of the Civil Engineer Corps and BuDocks: RADM. Mordecai T. Endicott, RADM. Harry H. Rousseau, RADM. Richard C. Hollyday,  RADM. Charles W. Park.<ref>[https://navfac.navy.mil/content/dam/navfac/PDFs/history/chiefs-short-bios-since-1898.pdf NAVFAC website Washington Navy Yard, DC]</ref>  Camp Peary was named for RADM. [[Robert Peary]].  The Seabees also named a Training Center for the first CEC killed in action, Lt. Irwin W. Lee and Lt. (jg) George W.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19 the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/> With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged. The same was done at the ABD Receiving Barracks [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], for the east coast.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\">{{cite report|title=History of the Seabees, Command Historian, Naval Facilities Engineering Command|year=1996|page=13|url=https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Publications/1996/01/01/History-of-the-Seabees-Command|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n=== CB rates ===\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bluejacket.com/usn_ratings.html |title=U.S. Navy Enlisted Rating Structure |website=bluejacket.com |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Naval Construction Battalions, Administration Manual |date=January 1944 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R610ZqnWj9AC&pg=SL24-PA70 |publisher= |pages=27\u201330 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |via=google books}}</ref>  These indicate the construction trade in which a Seabee is skilled.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] (UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and Marine Corps.\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].

While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both.  They remained at Anzio under continuous fire for an extended period. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one last task in the Mediterranean, [[Operation Dragoon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]].  These installations provided airfields and ports that supported [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the Northern sealanes. To complete a line of bases with this purpose, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to South for [[Operation Overlord]]. The Seabees built invasion bases from [[Milford Haven]] to [[Exter]]and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU). Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy fire and worked until all charges were placed and detonated. The gaps created in the obstacles permitted the assault to hit the beach.  With the invasion force waiting, Seabees placed pontoon causeways over which the assault could access the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Another Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material went ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters]] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to be a temporary port until French ports could be used.  Even after weather disabled the harbor Seabees continued to get thousands of tons supplies and troops ashore daily.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed to replace Mulberry A. Foreseeing the Allieds would want to use those harbors the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships simultaneously. They repeated this at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even put Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] across.\" <ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to set foot in Germany.  They also were the first CB to deployed by air.  They were flown to [[Bremen]] in April 1945 setting up camp on the city's out-skirts. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the U.S. Navy Hq in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion was back in England concluding Atlantic operations.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes en route to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job.

Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.

After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts.

The vast oceans between the U.S and the enemy on both sides made the [[Military logistics|logistics]] of war a major concern. [[Ben Moreell|Rear Admiral Moreell]] completely understood the issues at hand.  What needed to be done was build staging bases and create a military construction force to do build them to take the war to the enemy.  The concept of Naval Construction Battalions had been slowly developing at [[Naval Facilities Engineering Command]] [[Bureau of Yards and Docks]] (BuDocks) in the 1930s.  The onset of war clarified to Moreell the need to be able to develop advance bases to project American power.  The solution was to tap the United States vast pool of skilled labor. Put it in uniform to build anything, anywhere under any conditions and get the Marine Corps to train them. The first volunteers were skilled recruits at enlistment. To obtain these men, military age limits were modified to take 18\u201350 years old.  It was later found that several past 60 had managed to get in. Men were given advanced rank/pay based upon experience making the Seabees the highest paid group in the U.S. military.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web.mst.edu/~rogersda/umrcourses/ge342/SeaBees-Revised.pdf |first=J.

For the next year Seabees were picked by the [[Selective Service System]].  Recruits were younger and came with only basic skills.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  To address this issue the Seabees created training programs in more than 60 skilled trades. They would become renowned for unofficial trades like souvenir making, and the arts of obtaining materials by unofficial and unorthodox means<ref group=note>\"Cumshaw\" ({{cite web|title=Cumshaw definition|work=Merrian Webster|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/cumshaw}}) and \"moonlight procurement\"</ref> The key tools of the Seabees were [[bulldozers]], [[Float (nautical)|float pontoons]], [[Marston Mat]], corregated steel, applied with \"some ingenuity and [[elbow grease]]\"<ref name= \"USNWWII\">{{cite |title=The U.S. Navy in WWII |first= Mark |last=Henry|publisher= Osprey Publishing| series=Elite 80 |year=2002 |page=24}}</ref> Nearly 11,400 officers joined the [[Civil Engineer Corps]] during the war, and 7,960 of them served with CBs.  The Seebees simultaneously constructed on multiple islands, across vast distances in support of American forces. On February 13, 1945 the Chief of Naval Operations,  Fleet Admiral [[Ernest J. King]], approved the retention of CBs as a permanent part of the Navy.<ref>{{ cite |url=http://seabeemagazine.navylive.dodlive.mil/2018/02/11/This-Week-in-Seabee-History-February-11-February-17/On |date=February 11, 2018 |title=This Date in Seabee History |work=Seabee Online Magazine}}</ref>  Before that happened they would provide the men and skills needed by the top secret [[Chemical Warfare Service]] [[Flame tank|Flame Tank]] Group.\n\n== Pre-war naval construction development ==\nIn the late 1930s the US was not yet actively involved in fighting [[World War II]], but saw the need to prepare for such an eventuality. [[Rear Admiral]] [[Ben Moreell]], CEC, USN, became Chief of the Bureau of Yards and Docks (BUDOCKS) in 1937. Congress therefore authorized the expansion of naval Shore Activities, which included construction in the Caribbean and by 1939 in the Central Pacific. \"Following standard peacetime guidelines the Navy awarded these contracts to civilian constructions firms. These contractors employed native civilian populations as well as U.S citizens and were answerable to naval officers in charge of construction. By 1941 large U.S. naval bases were being built on Guam, Midway, Wake, Pearl Harbor, Iceland, Newfoundland, Bermuda, and Trinidad to name a few.\"<ref name=\"NHHC\">{{cite web|title=Seabee History: Introduction|publisher=Naval History and Heritage Command|date=Feb 17, 2017|url=https://www.history.navy.mil/content/history/nhhc/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/s/seabee-history0/seabee-history.html}}</ref> International law, dictated civilians not to resist enemy military attacks.

The first three Battalions were formed in the first month. Enlistment was voluntary until December 1942, when the [[Selective Service System]] became responsible for all recruitment.

BuDocks deemed it essential that CBs be commanded by [[Civil Engineer Corps]] (CEC) officers trained in the skills required for the execution of construction projects.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" />  The [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]] strongly objected to this violation of Naval tradition.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> Admiral Moreell took the issue directly to the Secretary of the Navy.<ref name=\"BBWWII\" /> On March 19 the Secretary gave the CEC authority to command all officers and enlisted assigned to naval construction units and granted the CEC command status for combat operations.<ref name=\"BBWWII\"/> With CBs authorized and the command question settled,  BuDocks then had to deal with recruitment and training.  Following that was deciding the military organization structure and organizing the logistical support necessary to make everything work. This all happened quickly.  Due to the exigencies of war there was a great deal of \"improvisation\", a quality that became synonymous with Seabees in general.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"At Naval Construction Training Centers (CTC) and Advanced Base Depots (ABD) on both coasts, Seabees learned: trade skills, military discipline, and advanced combat training. Although technically designated \"support\", Seabees frequently found themselves under fire with the Marines.  After completing boot training at [[Camp Allen]] VA. and later [[Camp Peary]] VA, the men were formed into CBs or other smaller CB units. The first four battalions were deployed immediately upon completion of recruit training due to the backlog of construction projects. Battalions that followed were sent to an ABDs at either [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], or [[Port Hueneme, California]] to be staged, outfitted, and trained prior to shipping out.  Basic military training was done by the Navy while the [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] provided [[United States Marine Corps School of Infantry|advanced military training]] at Camp Peary, Camp Lejeune or Camp Pendelton.  About 175,000 Seabees were staged out of Port Hueneme during the war.  Units that had seen extended service in the Pacific were returned to the [[R&R (military)|R&R]] Center at [[Camp Parks]], Shoemaker, CA. At Camp Parks units were reorganized, re-deployed or [[Demobilization|decommissioned]]. Men were given 30-day leaves and later, those eligible were discharged. The same was done at the ABD Receiving Barracks [[Davisville, Rhode Island]], for the east coast.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\">{{cite report|title=History of the Seabees, Command Historian, Naval Facilities Engineering Command|year=1996|page=13|url=https://health.mil/Reference-Center/Publications/1996/01/01/History-of-the-Seabees-Command|access-date=2019-12-13}}</ref>\n\n=== CB rates ===\n<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bluejacket.com/usn_ratings.html |title=U.S. Navy Enlisted Rating Structure |website=bluejacket.com |accessdate=18 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=U.S. Naval Construction Battalions, Administration Manual |date=January 1944 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R610ZqnWj9AC&pg=SL24-PA70 |publisher= |pages=27\u201330 |accessdate=18 October 2017 |via=google books}}</ref>  These indicate the construction trade in which a Seabee is skilled.

Each company could do smaller jobs independently as they each had all the basic ratings for doing any job.  Hq. Co. was made up  primarily of fleet yeomen, storekeepers, medical and dental personal, cooks, laundrymen, postal  clerks, gunners-mates [[Master-at-arms (United States Navy)|shore patrol]], chaplain plus Seabee draftsman and surveyors. The standard battalion complement was set at 32 officers and 1,073 enlisted.\n\n\"By 1944 construction projects grew in scope and scale.  Often more than one CB was assigned to a job. To promote efficient administrative control 3-4 battalions would be organized into a regiment, if necessary, two or more regiments were organized into a brigade. An example of this was Okinawa where 55,000 Seabees were organized into regiments and brigades. All were under the Commander, Construction Troops,  Commodore Andrew G. Bisset (CEC).  Additionally, he commanded 45,000 U.S. Army engineers making Okinawa the largest concentration of construction troops ever.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe overall total construction cost of Seabee projects was $11 billion.  At wars end they would number over 258,000. The NCF grew into 12 Naval Construction Brigades of: 54 Naval Construction Regiments, 151 Naval Construction Battalions, 39 Special Construction Battalions, 136 CB Maintaince Units, 118 CB Detachments, and 5 Pontoon Assembly Detachments.{{sfn|Rottman|2008|pages= 31\u201332}} In addition, many Seabees had served outside the NCF in [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU)s, [[Underwater Demolition Teams]] (UDT)s, Cubs, Lions Acorns and Marine Corps.\n\nWhile the CB itself was versatile it was apparent that some units could be smaller and/or specialized for task specific units.  \"The first departure from the standard CB was the \"Special\" Construction Battalion, or the \"CB Special\". \"Special\" CBs were composed of [[stevedores]] and [[longshoremen]] who were badly needed for the unloading of cargo in combat zones. Many officers for \"Specials\" were recruited from the [[United States Merchant Marine|Merchant Marine]] (and commissioned as CEC) while stevedoring companies were the source of many of the enlisted. Soon, the efficiency of cargo handling in combat zones was on a par to that found in the most efficient ports in the U.S.\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />  There were five battalions specialized in pontoons, barges, and causeways: 70th, 81st, 111th, 128th, 302nd.{{sfn |last= Rottman| 2002|page=31}}  The 134th & 139th CBs were made trucking units due to the transportation and logistic needs on Guam and Okinawa.\n\n\"Several different types of smaller, specialized units were created. Construction Battalion Maintenance Units/CBMUs, a quarter the size of a CB were one. They were Public Works units intended to assume base maintenance of newly constructed bases.  Another unit type was the Construction Battalion Detachment/CBD, of  6 to 600 men. CBDs did everything from running tire-repair shops to operating [[dredges]]. Many were tasked with the handling, launching, assembly, installation of pontoon causeways.  Others were petroleum dets specializing in [[pipeline transport|pipelines]] or [[Oil terminal|petroleum facilities]]).\"<ref name=\"CBHistory\" />\n\nThe \"Seabee\" logo in use today was created by Frank J. Iafrate, a file clerk employed at the [[Camp Endicott]], [[Quonset Point]], [[Rhode Island]]. Iafrate was known for his caricature drawings.  A lieutenant asked Iafrate if he could draw a \"[[Disney]] style\" insignia for the new Naval force. After brainstorming ideas,  the bee became his choice. Bees are the epitome of industry, hard work, and don't trouble others unless bothered first.  He spent three hours on a Sunday afternoon sketching.  He added the sailor's cap along with petty officer rank and the tools of the machinist mate's, carpenter's mate, and gunner's mate.  On each wrist he placed the CEC insignia above the glove. For a border he set the image inside a letter Q for Quonset Point. The next day he gave it to the lieutenant, who showed it to his captain, who sent it off to RADM. Moreell in Washington.  All RADM. Moreell requested was that Iafrate change the border from a Q to a hawser \"rope\" in keeping with Naval tradition for Naval insignia.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|title = The Origin of the Seabees|accessdate = May 20, 2014|website = NSVA.org|publisher = Navy Seabee Veterans of America, Inc.|url-status = dead|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131026120526/http://nsva.org/Seabee%20Orgin.htm|archivedate = October 26, 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== The Atlantic theater ===\n[[File:Omaha Mulberry Harbour.jpg|thumb|A [[Mulberry harbour#Whales|\"Whale\"]] roadway leading to a Spud pier at [[Mulberry harbour|Mulberry]] A off [[Omaha Beach]]]]\n[[File:US Army vehicles rolling off Mulberry A 16 June 1944.jpg|thumb|U.S. Army vehicles transit a floating causeway built by U.S. Navy Seabees off \"Mulberry A\" at Omaha Beach in June 1944]]\n\n\"When the U.S. found itself in a two ocean war, the Panama Canal became a strategic point. The convergence of shipping lanes necessitated forming bases to protect the approaches to the canal.  Agreements around the Caribbean made it possible to secure sites as needed. The [[Lend Lease Agreement]] with [[Great Britain]] also made sites available while existing bases were enlarged. Under the Greenslade Program naval bases in [[Puerto Rico]], [[Cuba]], and the [[Panama Canal]] Zone were all expanded. The construction program undertaken in Puerto Rico was ambitious. [[Naval Station Roosevelt Roads]] was turned into the \"[[Pearl Harbor]] of the Caribbean.  Construction on existing bases was done primarily by civilian contractors until late 1943.  Then CBs took over any unfinished projects. In the Atlantic the bases formed a line from [[Bermuda]] to Brazil. On the Pacific side of the Americas the U.S had bases from the [[Honduras]] to [[Ecuador]].<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\">{{cite book|chapter-url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Building_Bases/bases-18.html|chapter=Chapter XVIII: Bases in South America and the Caribbean Area, Including Bermuda|title={{harvp|Building the Navy's Bases in World War II}}: \u2026 Volume II|via=HyperWar}}</ref>  The 80th(colored) CB upgraded Carlson airfield on [[Trinidad]].  The 83rd CB cut highway out of [[Port of Spain]], that required moving a million cubic yards of material.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" /> \"On the [[Galapagos Islands]], CBD 1012 constructed a seaplane base with tank farm and did the same again at [[Salinas, Ecuador]]. Salinas would be the southernmost U.S. base in the Pacific.  In general, Seabees in this zone manned bases completed pre-war.  While not in combat zones they were necessary to the overall war effort.\"<ref name=\"NAVBASESoAm\" />\n\n\"[[North Africa]] was the Seabees first combat in the Atlantic.  Landing with the assault in November 1942, Seabees built facilities at [[Oran]], [[Casablanca]], [[Sifi]] and [[Fedala]]. Later they would build a string of staging and training areas along the [[Mediterranean]] including [[NAS Port Lyautey]], [[Morocco]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Once Tunisia was taken the Seabees began a buildup at [[Bizerte]]. There they prepped steel pontoon boxes for their first use in combat at Sicily. This Seabee \"innovation\" was adapted for amphibious warfare. A pontoon box was standardized in size so multiple pontoons could be quickly assembled like to form causeways, piers, or rhinos.  As such they could be used to meet the exigencies of amphibious warfare. The beaches of [[Sicily]] were considered impossible  for an amphibious landing by both the Allies and Axis.  The Seabees with their pontoons proved that was not true. The Germans were overwhelmed by the men and material that poured ashore over pontoon causeways.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee causeways were used again at [[Salerno]] and [[Anzio]]. The Germans were prepared causing heavy casualties at both.  They remained at Anzio under continuous fire for an extended period. When [[Southern Italy]] finally fell the Seabees had one last task in the Mediterranean, [[Operation Dragoon]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seabee operations in the [[North Atlantic]] begun early 1942.  The first were in [[Iceland]], [[Newfoundland]], and [[Greenland]].  These installations provided airfields and ports that supported [[Battle of the Atlantic|Allied convoys]] in the Northern sealanes. To complete a line of bases with this purpose, Seabees were sent to the UK. [[Port of Londonderry|Londonderry]], [[Northern Ireland]], [[Lough Erne]], [[Loch Ryan]], and [[Rosneath]] in [[Scotland]] were transformed into depots, tank farms, and seaplane bases.  Once completed the Seabees moved to South for [[Operation Overlord]]. The Seabees built invasion bases from [[Milford Haven]] to [[Exter]]and prepared for their most critical and multifaceted role in the Atlantic.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\nD-Day Normandy found Seabees amongst the first ashore as [[Naval Combat Demolition Units]] (NCDU). Their task was to remove beach obstacles built to impede amphibious landings.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"NCDUs came under very heavy fire and worked until all charges were placed and detonated. The gaps created in the obstacles permitted the assault to hit the beach.  With the invasion force waiting, Seabees placed pontoon causeways over which the assault could access the gaps.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Another Seabee contribution was their Rhinos. [[Rhino ferry|Rhino ferries]] were a motorized or towed variation of the modular pontoon boxes. With them vast amounts of men and material went ashore.  Seabees also assembled the offshore [[piers]], and [[breakwaters]] into [[Mulberry A]] for the American sector.  It was to be a temporary port until French ports could be used.  Even after weather disabled the harbor Seabees continued to get thousands of tons supplies and troops ashore daily.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The [[Battle of Cherbourg|liberation of Cherbourg]] and [[Operation Astonia|Le Havre]] provided CBs major projects. Those harbors were very much needed to replace Mulberry A. Foreseeing the Allieds would want to use those harbors the Germans had left them in ruins.  At Cherbourg the first cargo landed within 11 days of the Seabees arrival and within a month the harbor was handling 14 ships simultaneously. They repeated this at Le Havre and again at [[Brest, France|Brest]], [[Lorient]], and [[St. Nazaire]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The last Seabee project in Europe was the [[Operation Lumberjack|crossing of the Rhine]].  The U.S. Army called for Seabees to do the job.  The first crossing was at [[Bad Neuenahr]] near [[Remagen]]. More followed quickly  as the Seabees made the task look easy. On 22 March 1945, General [[George S. Patton]], put his armor across at [[Oppenheim]]. Seabees used pontoon ferries to get the job done. In all, they had more than 300 craft shuttling troops and armor across. One crew even put Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] across.\" <ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The 69th was the only CB to set foot in Germany.  They also were the first CB to deployed by air.  They were flown to [[Bremen]] in April 1945 setting up camp on the city's out-skirts. Their task was to repair damaged buildings and power lines for use by the U.S. occupation force. A detachment was sent to the nearby port of [[Bremerhaven]] make it operational.  Another detachment was sent to [[Frankfurt-am-Main]] to refurbish buildings for the U.S. Navy Hq in Germany.  By August 1945 the battalion was back in England concluding Atlantic operations.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n=== The Pacific theater ===\n[[File:B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944.jpg|thumb|B-29s Landing on Tinian 1944]]\n[[File:USMC Photo Nh-97250.jpg|thumb|[[Type A K\u014d-hy\u014dteki-class submarine]] two-man sub salvaged by 6th CB off Tassafaronga Point.]]\n[[File:\"34th CB's trading with natives from Malaita.

Their deeds were unparalleled in history.   With 80 percent of the NCF in the Pacific, they literally built the road to V-J-day with: 111 major airstrips, 441 piers, 2,558 ammunition magazines, 700 square blocks of warehouses, hospitals to for 70,000 patients, fuel tanks for 100 million gallons, and barracks for 1.5 million men. They would serve on over 300 islands.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"From the onset, the entire Pacific, including [[Alaska]] and the [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|Aleutians]] were Japanese targets. Japanese operations of 1942, took the islands of Attu and Kiska.  Seabees sent to the [[North Pacific|North]] were there to help forestall what appeared at the time to be a major Japanese offensive.  By late June 1942 they had begun bases on [[Adak Island|Adak]] and [[Amchitka]] in the Aleutians.  They would serve as a deterrent for the remainder of the war.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"The first CB projects were on [[Bora Bora]] where the 1st CB Detachment arrived February 1942. The det took the name \"Bobcats\" from the Operation's code name BOBCAT (they had departed the U.S. so quickly that the \"Seabee\" name did not exist). Their task was to construct a fuel depot for ships and planes en route to Australia. The Bobcats learned of many tropical issues: persistent precipitation, 50 types of [[dysentery]], numerous [[Tropical skin disease|skin diseases]], and the dreaded [[elephantiasis]]. These all combined to make conditions miserable and were harbingers of what was awaiting Seabees else-wheres. From the start their task was difficult, despite this there was satisfaction when the island's tank farms supported [[Task Force 44]] for the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"While the Bobcats were in transit to Bora Bora the 2nd and 3rd CB Dets were formed. The 2nd CB Det was sent to [[Tongatapu]] in the [[Tonga Islands]] while the 3rd CB Det went to [[Efate]] in the [[New Hebrides]].  Both islands were also on routes to Australia. . \nBases built on them would support actions in the Coral Sea and the [[Guadalcanal Campaign|Solomon Islands]]. [[Espiritu Santo]] in the [[New Hebrides]] became strategic when the Japanese took [[Guadalcanal]], the southern most point of their expansion.  Destruction of Japanese airfields nearing completion on that island became imperative to stop further expansion.  The 3rd CB Det was rushed from Efate to Espiritu Santo to build a countermanding airfield asap. Within 20 days a 6000ft airstrip had been carved from the jungle.  When Marines made their assault Guadalcanal the 6th CB became the first CB to see combat. Their task was keeping Henderson Field operational.  The Japanese made this a never-ending job. As fast as it was repaired they would bomb it again.  The first Seabee to be decorated received a Silver Star for actions there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  \"The Marines made simultaneous landings on [[Guadalcanal]] and [[Tulagi Island]] with Seabees tasked to both.

In December Seabees transferred to the 1st Marine Division landed at [[Battle of Cape Gloucester|Cape Gloucester]]. During the battle, Seabees of the 3rd Battalion [[19th Marines]] bulldozed paths to the Japanese lines so Marine tanks could attack.  They had to be told to hold up because they were so far beyond the lines.  By New Year's, the Marines had taken the enemy airfields on the Cape.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Taking the [[Admiralty Islands|Admiralities]] became key to isolating [[Rabaul]] and the neutralizing of New Britain.  Seizure of [[Manus Island]] and [[Los Negros Island]] cut supplies from all points north and east. By 1944 Seabees had transformed those islands into the largest Lion and Oak in the Southwest Pacific.  It became the main supply and repair depot of the [[Seventh Fleet]]. The [[Landing on Emirau|capture of Emirau]] completed the encirclement of Rabaul.  A strategic two-field Oak, with depots, dry dock, and PT base was constructed there.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"[[Island hopping]] with Gen. [[Douglas MacArthur|MacArthur]] CBs reached [[Jayapura|Hollandia]] making it instrumental in the liberation of the Philippines. The 3rd Naval Construction Brigade was with MacArthur for return to [[Battle of Leyte|Leyte]]. Seabee pontoon barges and causeways brought MacArthur's Forces ashore.  Those Seabees were joined by the 2nd and 7th Naval Construction Brigades. This NCF totaled 37,000 and would turn the Philippines into a forward base for the assault on the Japan.  The 7th Fleet Hq was moved to the there with Seabees building everything required: fleet anchorages, sub bases, fleet repair facilities, fuel and supply depots, Pt bases and air stations.<ref name=CBHISTORY/>  At [[Dulag, Leyte]]  Seabee activity finally became a priority to the Japanese .  There the 61st CB had a detachment building a fighter strip come under aerial assault by Japanese [[paratroopers]].  The battle lasted 72 hours with the Japanese losing over 350 men.<ref>Seafoam, 61st CB cruisebook, 14 April 1945, p. 46</ref>\n\n\"In the Central Pacific CBs we're both directly and indirectly involved in the fighting.  After landing in all the Marine assaults, CBs built the bases from which the U.S. moved relentlessly toward the Japanese homeland.  [[Tarawa Atoll|Tarawa]] in the Gilberts was bad, but in fifteen hours Seabees had the airfield operational.  They turned Majuro Atoll into one of the fleet's Lions and similarly transformed Kwajalein Atoll into a Oak.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"Seizure of the Marianas marked the beginning of the end. Their loss cut a Japanese line of defense.  More important, they placed Japan within range of U.S. bombers. During Operation \"Forager,\" Seabees made some of their most significant contributions in the Pacific landing with the Marines at [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwanjalein]],[[Battle of Saipan|Saipan]], [[Battle of Guam (1944)|Guam]], and [[Battle of Tinian|Tinian]]. The day the Marines captured [[Saipan International Airport|Aslito]] on Saipan, the Seabees went to work to get it operational in four days. During the battle for Guam,  CB Specials did stevedoring while others were combat engineers for the Marines.  When they were done CBs turned Guam into a Lion HQ for the fleet and an Oak for B-29s. The invasion of Tinian was a showcase of Seabee ingenuity and engineering. The CEC engineered detachable ramps mounted on [[Landing Vehicle Tracked|LVT-2s]] making landings possible where the Japanese thought it was impossible. Before the island was even secure, Seabees were completing an unfinished Japanese airfield.\"<ref name=CBHISTORY/>\n\n\"After the Marianas B-29s were in need of an emergency landing field and a forward base for fighter escorts. The island chosen was [[Iwo Jima]] which [[V Amphibious Corps]]  assaulted on 19 February 1945.  For the assault the[[Naval Mobile Construction Battalion 133|133rd CB]] and the 31st CB were [[Temporary duty assignment|attached]] to the 4th and 5th Marine Divisions  as shore party.  The 133rd suffered the most casualties in Seabee History tasked to the 23rd Marines.  Only basic road construction was accomplished during the first days.

The 58th, 71st, and 145th CBs were all attached the 1st, 2nd and 6th Marine Divisions for the assault.  Numerous CBs followed as the Okinawa task was immense: a road system, numerous air bases, quonset cities, supply and fuel depots, hospital and harbor facilities.

As the battle progressed, portable flame units were sustaining casualty rates as high as 92%, leaving few troops trained to use the weapon.

Rather, they were \"pooled\" and would dispatch from their respective refueling locations.

Some Pok\u00e9mon in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''.\n\nThe following list details the 135&nbsp;Pok\u00e9mon of Generation&nbsp;III in order of their [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Pok\u00e9dex|National Pok\u00e9dex]] number. The first Pok\u00e9mon, [[#Treecko|Treecko]], is number 252 and the last, [[Deoxys]], is number 386. Alternate forms that result in type changes are included for convenience. Mega evolutions and regional forms are included on the pages for the generation in which they were introduced.\n\n==Design and development==\n''[[Nintendo Life]]'' noted in a retrospective that the third generation of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' has a very different \"feel\" from the two generations that came before it because almost all of its 135 new Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 save for [[Azurill]] and [[Wynaut]] \u2013 have no relation to those of the previous generations. Unlike the first two generations, two of the \"starter\" Pok\u00e9mon of ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' gain a secondary typing in their final form, giving them a wider range of abilities. ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' features two \"Mythical Pok\u00e9mon\" \u2013 [[Jirachi]] and [[Deoxys]] \u2013 both of which became available to coincide with their respective [[List of Pok\u00e9mon films|anime movies]].<ref name=Retrospective>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/11/feature_a_pokemon_retrospective_generation_3_-_2002_to_2006|work=[[Nintendo Life]]|title=Feature: A Pok\u00e9mon Retrospective: Generation 3 - 2002 to 2006|last=Merrick|first=Joe|date=2015-11-05}}</ref>\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' significantly increased the amount of \"Dark\"- and \"Steel\"-type Pok\u00e9mon in the series, as only a few Pok\u00e9mon in previous generations used these typings. ''Hardcore Gamer'' also noted that many of the new Pok\u00e9mon made use of \"dual typing\", where Pok\u00e9mon have both a primary and a secondary type; this wasn't nearly as common in ''Red'' and ''Blue'' or ''Gold'' and ''Silver''.<ref name=HardcoreGamer>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/05/13/how-ruby-and-sapphire-changed-the-pokemon-series-forever/84572/|work=Hardcore Gamer|title=How Ruby and Sapphire Changed the Pokemon Series Forever|last=Carlson|first=Alex|date=2014-05-13}}</ref>\n\n==List of Pok\u00e9mon==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of Pok\u00e9mon species introduced in Generation III (2002){{refn|group=nb|name=Pok\u00e9dex|Details on Pok\u00e9mon names, National Pok\u00e9dex numbers, types, and evolutions are obtained from [[The Pok\u00e9mon Company|The Pok\u00e9mon Company International]]'s online Pok\u00e9dex.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[The Pok\u00e9mon Company|The Pok\u00e9mon Company International]]|year=2015|accessdate=October 19, 2015|title=Pok\u00e9dex|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/}}</ref>}}\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=2 width=\"16%\"| Name\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=2 width=\"7%\"| National Pok\u00e9dex<br />number\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=2 width=\"15%\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon types|Type(s)]]\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=2 width=\"12%\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|Evolves]] into\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=2 width=\"40%\"| Notes\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"8%\"| English\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"8%\"| Japanese\n!scope=\"col\"| Primary\n!scope=\"col\"| Secondary\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Treecko}} Treecko\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30ad\u30e2\u30ea Kimori}}<ref name=\"bandai12\">{{cite web|url=http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8753/43476525.jpg |title=\u30ad\u30e1\u308f\u3056\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30ad\u30c3\u30baDP4 |date=December 2009 |publisher=[[Bandai Co., Ltd.]] (via [[WebCite]]) |accessdate=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rZTQqD8t?url=http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8753/43476525.jpg |archivedate=28 July 2010 }}</ref>\n|align=center| {{nts|252}}\n|bgcolor=\"#2DCD45\" colspan=2 align=center| Grass\n|align=center| [[#Grovyle|Grovyle (#253)]]\n|Treecko has claws at the bottom of its feet so it can scale walls and ceilings.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Grovyle}} Grovyle\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30b8\u30e5\u30d7\u30c8\u30eb Juputoru}}<ref name=\"bandai1\" />\n|align=center| {{nts|253}}\n|bgcolor=\"#2DCD45\" colspan=2 align=center| Grass\n|align=center| [[#Sceptile|Sceptile (#254)]]\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Sceptile}} Sceptile\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30b8\u30e5\u30ab\u30a4\u30f3 Jukain}}<ref name=\"bandai4\">{{cite web|url=http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4373/28867732.jpg |title=\u30ad\u30e1\u308f\u3056\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30ad\u30c3\u30ba4 |date=July 2006 |publisher=[[Bandai Co., Ltd.]] (via [[WebCite]]) |accessdate=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rZSvdF7r?url=http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4373/28867732.jpg |archivedate=28 July 2010 }}</ref>\n|align=center| {{nts|254}}\n|bgcolor=\"#2DCD45\" colspan=2 align=center| Grass\n|align=center| Mega Evolution\n|A playable character in Pokken Tournament and its counterpart.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Torchic}} Torchic\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30a2\u30c1\u30e3\u30e2 Achamo}}<ref name=\"bandai12\" />\n|align=center| {{nts|255}}\n|bgcolor=\"#F08030\" colspan=2 align=center| Fire\n|align=center| [[#Combusken|Combusken (#256)]]\n|It can scorch foes black with its fireballs it produces in its stomach.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Combusken}} Combusken\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30ef\u30ab\u30b7\u30e3\u30e2 Wakashamo}}<ref name=\"bandai1\" />\n|align=center| {{nts|256}}\n|bgcolor=\"#F08030\" align=center| Fire\n|bgcolor=\"#94352D\" align=center| {{font color|white|Fighting}}\n|align=center| [[#Blaziken|Blaziken (#257)]]\n|It can produce about 100 kicks a second.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Blaziken}} [[Blaziken]]\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30d0\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30e2 Bash\u0101mo}}<ref name=\"bandai4\" />\n|align=center| {{nts|257}}\n|bgcolor=\"#F08030\" align=center| Fire\n|bgcolor=\"#94352D\" align=center| {{font color|white|Fighting}}\n|align=center| Mega Evolution\n|A playable character in Pokken Tournament and its counterrparts.

Some Pok\u00e9mon in this generation were introduced in animated adaptations of the franchise before ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire''.\n\nThe following list details the 135&nbsp;Pok\u00e9mon of Generation&nbsp;III in order of their [[Gameplay of Pok\u00e9mon#Pok\u00e9dex|National Pok\u00e9dex]] number. The first Pok\u00e9mon, [[#Treecko|Treecko]], is number 252 and the last, [[Deoxys]], is number 386. Alternate forms that result in type changes are included for convenience. Mega evolutions and regional forms are included on the pages for the generation in which they were introduced.\n\n==Design and development==\n''[[Nintendo Life]]'' noted in a retrospective that the third generation of ''Pok\u00e9mon'' has a very different \"feel\" from the two generations that came before it because almost all of its 135 new Pok\u00e9mon \u2013 save for [[Azurill]] and [[Wynaut]] \u2013 have no relation to those of the previous generations. Unlike the first two generations, two of the \"starter\" Pok\u00e9mon of ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' gain a secondary typing in their final form, giving them a wider range of abilities. ''Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' features two \"Mythical Pok\u00e9mon\" \u2013 [[Jirachi]] and [[Deoxys]] \u2013 both of which became available to coincide with their respective [[List of Pok\u00e9mon films|anime movies]].<ref name=Retrospective>{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2015/11/feature_a_pokemon_retrospective_generation_3_-_2002_to_2006|work=[[Nintendo Life]]|title=Feature: A Pok\u00e9mon Retrospective: Generation 3 - 2002 to 2006|last=Merrick|first=Joe|date=2015-11-05}}</ref>\n\n''Pok\u00e9mon Ruby'' and ''Sapphire'' significantly increased the amount of \"Dark\"- and \"Steel\"-type Pok\u00e9mon in the series, as only a few Pok\u00e9mon in previous generations used these typings. ''Hardcore Gamer'' also noted that many of the new Pok\u00e9mon made use of \"dual typing\", where Pok\u00e9mon have both a primary and a secondary type; this wasn't nearly as common in ''Red'' and ''Blue'' or ''Gold'' and ''Silver''.<ref name=HardcoreGamer>{{cite web|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/05/13/how-ruby-and-sapphire-changed-the-pokemon-series-forever/84572/|work=Hardcore Gamer|title=How Ruby and Sapphire Changed the Pokemon Series Forever|last=Carlson|first=Alex|date=2014-05-13}}</ref>\n\n==List of Pok\u00e9mon==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\"\n|+ List of Pok\u00e9mon species introduced in Generation III (2002){{refn|group=nb|name=Pok\u00e9dex|Details on Pok\u00e9mon names, National Pok\u00e9dex numbers, types, and evolutions are obtained from [[The Pok\u00e9mon Company|The Pok\u00e9mon Company International]]'s online Pok\u00e9dex.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=[[The Pok\u00e9mon Company|The Pok\u00e9mon Company International]]|year=2015|accessdate=October 19, 2015|title=Pok\u00e9dex|url=http://www.pokemon.com/us/pokedex/}}</ref>}}\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=2 width=\"16%\"| Name\n!scope=\"col\" rowspan=2 width=\"7%\"| National Pok\u00e9dex<br />number\n!scope=\"col\" colspan=2 width=\"15%\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon types|Type(s)]]\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=2 width=\"12%\"| [[Pok\u00e9mon evolution|Evolves]] into\n!scope=\"col\" class=\"unsortable\" rowspan=2 width=\"40%\"| Notes\n|-\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"8%\"| English\n!scope=\"col\" width=\"8%\"| Japanese\n!scope=\"col\"| Primary\n!scope=\"col\"| Secondary\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Treecko}} Treecko\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30ad\u30e2\u30ea Kimori}}<ref name=\"bandai12\">{{cite web|url=http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8753/43476525.jpg |title=\u30ad\u30e1\u308f\u3056\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30ad\u30c3\u30baDP4 |date=December 2009 |publisher=[[Bandai Co., Ltd.]] (via [[WebCite]]) |accessdate=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rZTQqD8t?url=http://img80.imageshack.us/img80/8753/43476525.jpg |archivedate=28 July 2010 }}</ref>\n|align=center| {{nts|252}}\n|bgcolor=\"#2DCD45\" colspan=2 align=center| Grass\n|align=center| [[#Grovyle|Grovyle (#253)]]\n|Treecko has claws at the bottom of its feet so it can scale walls and ceilings.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Grovyle}} Grovyle\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30b8\u30e5\u30d7\u30c8\u30eb Juputoru}}<ref name=\"bandai1\" />\n|align=center| {{nts|253}}\n|bgcolor=\"#2DCD45\" colspan=2 align=center| Grass\n|align=center| [[#Sceptile|Sceptile (#254)]]\n|\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Sceptile}} Sceptile\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30b8\u30e5\u30ab\u30a4\u30f3 Jukain}}<ref name=\"bandai4\">{{cite web|url=http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4373/28867732.jpg |title=\u30ad\u30e1\u308f\u3056\u30dd\u30b1\u30e2\u30f3\u30ad\u30c3\u30ba4 |date=July 2006 |publisher=[[Bandai Co., Ltd.]] (via [[WebCite]]) |accessdate=28 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5rZSvdF7r?url=http://img22.imageshack.us/img22/4373/28867732.jpg |archivedate=28 July 2010 }}</ref>\n|align=center| {{nts|254}}\n|bgcolor=\"#2DCD45\" colspan=2 align=center| Grass\n|align=center| Mega Evolution\n|A playable character in Pokken Tournament and its counterpart.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Torchic}} Torchic\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30a2\u30c1\u30e3\u30e2 Achamo}}<ref name=\"bandai12\" />\n|align=center| {{nts|255}}\n|bgcolor=\"#F08030\" colspan=2 align=center| Fire\n|align=center| [[#Combusken|Combusken (#256)]]\n|It can scorch foes black with its fireballs it produces in its stomach.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Combusken}} Combusken\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30ef\u30ab\u30b7\u30e3\u30e2 Wakashamo}}<ref name=\"bandai1\" />\n|align=center| {{nts|256}}\n|bgcolor=\"#F08030\" align=center| Fire\n|bgcolor=\"#94352D\" align=center| {{font color|white|Fighting}}\n|align=center| [[#Blaziken|Blaziken (#257)]]\n|It can produce about 100 kicks a second.\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"| {{anchor|Blaziken}} [[Blaziken]]\n!scope=\"row\"| {{nihongo||\u30d0\u30b7\u30e3\u30fc\u30e2 Bash\u0101mo}}<ref name=\"bandai4\" />\n|align=center| {{nts|257}}\n|bgcolor=\"#F08030\" align=center| Fire\n|bgcolor=\"#94352D\" align=center| {{font color|white|Fighting}}\n|align=center| Mega Evolution\n|A playable character in Pokken Tournament and its counterrparts.
