The term was coined in 1944 by [[Raphael Lemkin]]. It is defined in Article 2 of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] (CPPCG) of 1948 as \"any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a [[nation]]al, [[ethnicity|ethnical]]<!--\"ethnical\" is quoted from the document; although unusual, it is found in several dictionaries-->, [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[Religion|religious]] group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the groups conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\"<ref name=CPPCG>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/genocide.htm|title=Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|work=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=12 January 1951|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211121830/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/genocide.htm|archivedate=11 December 2005}} Note: \"ethnical\", although unusual, is found in several dictionaries.</ref>\n\nThe preamble to the CPPCG states that \"genocide is a crime under [[international law]], contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world\" and that \"at all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity.\"<ref name=CPPCG/>\n\nDetermining what historical events constitute a ''genocide'' and which are merely criminal or inhuman behavior is not a clear-cut matter. In nearly every case where accusations of genocide have circulated, partisans of various sides have fiercely disputed the details and interpretation of the event, often to the point of depicting wildly different versions of the facts.\n\n==Alternate definitions==\n{{See also|Genocide definitions}}\nThe debate continues over what legally constitutes genocide. One definition is any conflict that the [[International Criminal Court]] has so designated. Many conflicts that have been labeled genocide in the popular press have not been so designated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Debate continues over what constitutes genocide|url=http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/02/05/debate-continues-over-what-constitutes-genocide/3925/|work=Blogwatch|publisher=[[Worldfocus]]|accessdate=17 November 2012|date=5 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nM.

J. Rummel]], genocide has multiple meanings. The ordinary meaning is murder by a government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial, or religious group membership. The legal meaning is defined by CCPG. This includes actions such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children to another group. Rummel created the term [[democide]] to include assaults on political groups.{{sfn|Rummel|1998|p=[http://www.Hawaii.edu/powerkills/GENOCIDE.HTM Democide versus genocide; which is what?]}}\n\nIn this article, atrocities that have been characterized as genocide by some reliable source are included, whether or not this is supported by mainstream scholarship. The acts may involve mass killings, mass deportations, [[politicide]]s, democides, withholding of food and/or other necessities of life, death by deliberate exposure to invasive infectious disease agents or combinations of these. Thus examples listed may constitute genocide by the United Nations definition, or by one of the alternate interpretations.\n\n==Pre\u2013World War I==\n{{See also|Genocide of indigenous peoples#Pre\u20131948 examples}}\nAccording to Canadian scholar [[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Adam Jones]], if a dominant group of people has little in common with a marginalized group of people, it is easy for the dominant group to define the other as subhuman. As a result, the marginalized group might be labeled as a threat that must be eliminated.<ref name=\"Jones-3.5\">{{harvnb|Jones|2006|p=3}} footnote 5 cites Helen Fein, ''Genocide: A Sociological Perspective'', (London: Sage, 1993), p.&nbsp;26</ref> Jones continues: \"The difficulty, as [[Frank Chalk]] and [[Kurt Jonassohn]] pointed out in their early study, is that such historical records as exist are ambiguous and undependable. While history today is generally written with some fealty to 'objective' facts, most previous accounts aimed rather to praise the writer's patron (normally the leader) and to emphasize the superiority of one's own gods and religious beliefs.\"{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=3}}\n\nChalk and Jonassohn: \"Historically and anthropologically peoples have always had a name for themselves. In a great many cases, that name meant 'the people' to set the owners of that name off against all other people who were considered of lesser quality in some way. If the differences between the people and some other society were particularly large in terms of religion, language, manners, customs, and so on, then such others were seen as less than fully human: pagans, savages, or even animals.\"{{sfn|Chalk|Jonassohn|1990|p=28}}\n\n===Before 1490===\n====Neanderthals====\nHypotheses which suggest that genocidal violence [[Neanderthal extinction hypotheses|may have caused the extinction]] of the [[Neanderthals]] have been offered by several authors, including [[Jared Diamond]]{{sfn|Diamond|1992}} and [[Ronald Wright]].{{sfn|Wright|2004|pp=24, 37}} However, several scholars have formed alternative theories as to why the Neanderthals died off, which means there is no clear consensus as to what caused their extinction within the scientific community.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gail Glover |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-02-neanderthals-extinction-modern-humans-emerged.html |title=Neanderthals may have faced extinction long before modern humans emerged |publisher=Phys.org |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Chiefdoms====\nGenocide was the norm in the form of warfare that was waged by [[chiefdom]]s. The outcome, if it was decisive, was the total annihilation of the vanquished side.<ref>[[Robert Carneiro]], \u201cChiefdom-level warfare as exemplified in Fiji and the Cauca Valley,\u201d ''Anthropology of War'', ed. Jonathan Haas, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990, p 190-215.</ref>\n\n====Ancient gendercides====\nScholars of [[Ancient history|antiquity]] differentiate genocide from [[gendercide]], in which groups of people were conquered and the males who belonged to the conquered groups were killed but the children (particularly girls) and women were incorporated into the conquering groups. Jones notes, \"Chalk and Jonassohn provide a wide-ranging selection of historical events such as the [[Assyrian Empire]]'s root-and branch depredations in the first half of the first millennium BCE, and the destruction of [[Melos]] by [[Athens]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]] (fifth century BCE), a gendercidal rampage described by [[Thucydides]] in his '[[Melian Dialogue]]'{{-\"}}.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=5}} The [[Old Testament]] documents the destruction of the [[Midian]]ites, taking place during the life of [[Moses]] in the 2nd millennium BCE. The [[Book of Numbers]] chapter 31 recounts that an army of [[Israelites]] killed every Midianite man but captured the women and children as plunder. These were later killed at the command of Moses, with the exception of girls who were [[Virginity|virgins]]. The total number killed is not recorded but the number of surviving girls is recorded by the [[Book of Numbers]] as 32,000.\n\n====Hebrew genocide====\nAccording to the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Moses]] and [[Joshua]] annihilated the [[Canaan]]ites (Numbers 21:2-3; Deuteronomy 20:17; Joshua 6:17, 21) and [[Saul]] annihilated the [[Amalek]]ites (1 Samuel 15). These two accounts are in accord with chiefdom-level warfare as it is described by Anthropologist [[Robert Carneiro]].<ref>\u201cChiefdom-level warfare as exemplified in Fiji and the Cauca Valley,\u201d Anthropology of War, ed. Jonathan Haas, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990, p 190-215.</ref> The twelve Israelite tribes formed what anthropologists term a [[chiefdom]] and the two parallel accounts suggests the historicity of the events.\n\n====Destruction of Carthage====\n[[Ben Kiernan]] has labelled the [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|destruction]] of [[Carthage]] at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] (149\u2013146 BCE) \"The First Genocide\".{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=5}}\n\n==== Asiatic Vespers ====\nIn 88 BC, King [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]] of Pontus ordered the murder of all Italians in Asia Minor resulting in the deaths of about 100,000, mainly civilians. This action provoked the Romans leading to the [[First Mithridatic War]].\n\n====Anasazi====\nA 2010 study suggests that a group of [[Ancestral Puebloans|Anasazi]] in the [[Southwestern United States|American Southwest]] were killed in a genocide that took place circa 800 CE.<ref name=\"Potter 2010\">{{cite journal|last=Potter|first=James M.|author2=Jason P.

This campaign began with the [[1966 anti-Igbo pogrom]] and the [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup]]. In the pogrom, Igbo property was destroyed and up to 300,000 Igbos fled the North and sought safety in the East and about 30,000 Igbos were killed.

Initially on the offensive, [[Biafra]] began to suffer and its government frequently had to move because the Nigerian army kept on conquering its capital cities.

The term was coined in 1944 by [[Raphael Lemkin]]. It is defined in Article 2 of the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide]] (CPPCG) of 1948 as \"any of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a [[nation]]al, [[ethnicity|ethnical]]<!--\"ethnical\" is quoted from the document; although unusual, it is found in several dictionaries-->, [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] or [[Religion|religious]] group, as such: killing members of the group; causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; deliberately inflicting on the groups conditions of life, calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part; imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group; [and] forcibly transferring children of the group to another group.\"<ref name=CPPCG>{{cite web|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/genocide.htm|title=Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|work=Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|date=12 January 1951|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211121830/http://www.ohchr.org/english/law/genocide.htm|archivedate=11 December 2005}} Note: \"ethnical\", although unusual, is found in several dictionaries.</ref>\n\nThe preamble to the CPPCG states that \"genocide is a crime under [[international law]], contrary to the spirit and aims of the United Nations and condemned by the civilized world\" and that \"at all periods of history genocide has inflicted great losses on humanity.\"<ref name=CPPCG/>\n\nDetermining what historical events constitute a ''genocide'' and which are merely criminal or inhuman behavior is not a clear-cut matter. In nearly every case where accusations of genocide have circulated, partisans of various sides have fiercely disputed the details and interpretation of the event, often to the point of depicting wildly different versions of the facts.\n\n==Alternate definitions==\n{{See also|Genocide definitions}}\nThe debate continues over what legally constitutes genocide. One definition is any conflict that the [[International Criminal Court]] has so designated. Many conflicts that have been labeled genocide in the popular press have not been so designated.<ref>{{cite web|title=Debate continues over what constitutes genocide|url=http://worldfocus.org/blog/2009/02/05/debate-continues-over-what-constitutes-genocide/3925/|work=Blogwatch|publisher=[[Worldfocus]]|accessdate=17 November 2012|date=5 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nM.

J. Rummel]], genocide has multiple meanings. The ordinary meaning is murder by a government of people due to their national, ethnic, racial, or religious group membership. The legal meaning is defined by CCPG. This includes actions such as preventing births or forcibly transferring children to another group. Rummel created the term [[democide]] to include assaults on political groups.{{sfn|Rummel|1998|p=[http://www.Hawaii.edu/powerkills/GENOCIDE.HTM Democide versus genocide; which is what?]}}\n\nIn this article, atrocities that have been characterized as genocide by some reliable source are included, whether or not this is supported by mainstream scholarship. The acts may involve mass killings, mass deportations, [[politicide]]s, democides, withholding of food and/or other necessities of life, death by deliberate exposure to invasive infectious disease agents or combinations of these. Thus examples listed may constitute genocide by the United Nations definition, or by one of the alternate interpretations.\n\n==Pre\u2013World War I==\n{{See also|Genocide of indigenous peoples#Pre\u20131948 examples}}\nAccording to Canadian scholar [[Adam Jones (Canadian scholar)|Adam Jones]], if a dominant group of people has little in common with a marginalized group of people, it is easy for the dominant group to define the other as subhuman. As a result, the marginalized group might be labeled as a threat that must be eliminated.<ref name=\"Jones-3.5\">{{harvnb|Jones|2006|p=3}} footnote 5 cites Helen Fein, ''Genocide: A Sociological Perspective'', (London: Sage, 1993), p.&nbsp;26</ref> Jones continues: \"The difficulty, as [[Frank Chalk]] and [[Kurt Jonassohn]] pointed out in their early study, is that such historical records as exist are ambiguous and undependable. While history today is generally written with some fealty to 'objective' facts, most previous accounts aimed rather to praise the writer's patron (normally the leader) and to emphasize the superiority of one's own gods and religious beliefs.\"{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=3}}\n\nChalk and Jonassohn: \"Historically and anthropologically peoples have always had a name for themselves. In a great many cases, that name meant 'the people' to set the owners of that name off against all other people who were considered of lesser quality in some way. If the differences between the people and some other society were particularly large in terms of religion, language, manners, customs, and so on, then such others were seen as less than fully human: pagans, savages, or even animals.\"{{sfn|Chalk|Jonassohn|1990|p=28}}\n\n===Before 1490===\n====Neanderthals====\nHypotheses which suggest that genocidal violence [[Neanderthal extinction hypotheses|may have caused the extinction]] of the [[Neanderthals]] have been offered by several authors, including [[Jared Diamond]]{{sfn|Diamond|1992}} and [[Ronald Wright]].{{sfn|Wright|2004|pp=24, 37}} However, several scholars have formed alternative theories as to why the Neanderthals died off, which means there is no clear consensus as to what caused their extinction within the scientific community.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gail Glover |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-02-neanderthals-extinction-modern-humans-emerged.html |title=Neanderthals may have faced extinction long before modern humans emerged |publisher=Phys.org |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=13 February 2016}}</ref>\n\n====Chiefdoms====\nGenocide was the norm in the form of warfare that was waged by [[chiefdom]]s. The outcome, if it was decisive, was the total annihilation of the vanquished side.<ref>[[Robert Carneiro]], \u201cChiefdom-level warfare as exemplified in Fiji and the Cauca Valley,\u201d ''Anthropology of War'', ed. Jonathan Haas, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990, p 190-215.</ref>\n\n====Ancient gendercides====\nScholars of [[Ancient history|antiquity]] differentiate genocide from [[gendercide]], in which groups of people were conquered and the males who belonged to the conquered groups were killed but the children (particularly girls) and women were incorporated into the conquering groups. Jones notes, \"Chalk and Jonassohn provide a wide-ranging selection of historical events such as the [[Assyrian Empire]]'s root-and branch depredations in the first half of the first millennium BCE, and the destruction of [[Melos]] by [[Athens]] during the [[Peloponnesian War]] (fifth century BCE), a gendercidal rampage described by [[Thucydides]] in his '[[Melian Dialogue]]'{{-\"}}.{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=5}} The [[Old Testament]] documents the destruction of the [[Midian]]ites, taking place during the life of [[Moses]] in the 2nd millennium BCE. The [[Book of Numbers]] chapter 31 recounts that an army of [[Israelites]] killed every Midianite man but captured the women and children as plunder. These were later killed at the command of Moses, with the exception of girls who were [[Virginity|virgins]]. The total number killed is not recorded but the number of surviving girls is recorded by the [[Book of Numbers]] as 32,000.\n\n====Hebrew genocide====\nAccording to the [[Hebrew Bible]], [[Moses]] and [[Joshua]] annihilated the [[Canaan]]ites (Numbers 21:2-3; Deuteronomy 20:17; Joshua 6:17, 21) and [[Saul]] annihilated the [[Amalek]]ites (1 Samuel 15). These two accounts are in accord with chiefdom-level warfare as it is described by Anthropologist [[Robert Carneiro]].<ref>\u201cChiefdom-level warfare as exemplified in Fiji and the Cauca Valley,\u201d Anthropology of War, ed. Jonathan Haas, New York: Cambridge University Press, 1990, p 190-215.</ref> The twelve Israelite tribes formed what anthropologists term a [[chiefdom]] and the two parallel accounts suggests the historicity of the events.\n\n====Destruction of Carthage====\n[[Ben Kiernan]] has labelled the [[Siege of Carthage (c. 149\u2013146 BC)|destruction]] of [[Carthage]] at the end of the [[Third Punic War]] (149\u2013146 BCE) \"The First Genocide\".{{sfn|Jones|2006|p=5}}\n\n==== Asiatic Vespers ====\nIn 88 BC, King [[Mithridates VI of Pontus|Mithridates VI]] of Pontus ordered the murder of all Italians in Asia Minor resulting in the deaths of about 100,000, mainly civilians.

Civilians killed in reprisals during the Soviet partisan war account for a major part of the huge toll. The report of Philimoshin lists the deaths of civilian forced laborers in Germany as totaling 2,164,313. G. I. Krivosheev in the report on military casualties gives a total of 1,103,300 dead POWs. The total of these two figures is 3,267,613, which is in close agreement with estimates by western historians of about 3 million deaths of prisoners in German captivity.

This campaign began with the [[1966 anti-Igbo pogrom]] and the [[1966 Nigerian counter-coup]]. In the pogrom, Igbo property was destroyed and up to 300,000 Igbos fled the North and sought safety in the East and about 30,000 Igbos were killed. In the counter-coup that followed, Igbo civilians and military personnel were also systematically murdered.<ref>https://sites.tufts.edu/atrocityendings/2015/08/07/nigeria-civil-war/</ref> On May 30, 1967, when the Igbos declared their independence from Nigeria and formed the breakaway state of [[Biafra]], the Nigerian and British governments<ref name=\"pambazuka.org\">https://www.pambazuka.org/human-security/igbo-genocide-britain-and-united-states-pt1</ref> launched a total blockade of Biafra. Initially on the offensive, [[Biafra]] began to suffer and its government frequently had to move because the Nigerian army kept on conquering its capital cities. The main cause of death was [[starvation]], and children suffered the most. Children were often afflicted with [[Kwashiorkor]], a disease caused by [[malnutrition]].

There are many estimates for the death toll of the Igbo in the genocide. The number of soldiers who were killed in the war is estimated to be 100,000 and the number of civilians who were also killed ranges from 500,000 to 3.5 million. More than half of those who died in the war were children.<ref name=\"pambazuka.org\"/> Currently, Nigeria still suppresses peaceful protests by Biafra independence hopefuls, often by sending soldiers to beat protestors and even to kill them.<ref>https://www.latimes.com/world/africa/la-fg-nigeria-biafra-20161126-story.html</ref>\n\n====Algeria====\n{{further|Algerian War}}\nAfter independence was gained after the [[Algerian War]] the [[Harkis]] ([[Muslims]] who supported the French during the war) were seen as traitors by many Algerians, and many of those who stayed behind suffered severe reprisals after independence.

Those from Asia Minor constituted the bulk of [[Byzantine Greeks|the empire's Greek-speaking Orthodox Christians]]; thus, many renowned Greek figures during late antiquity, the Middle Ages, and the Renaissance came from Asia Minor, including [[Saint Nicholas]] (270\u2013343 AD), rhetorician [[John Chrysostomos]] (349\u2013407 AD), [[Hagia Sophia]] architect [[Isidore of Miletus]] (6th century AD), several imperial dynasties, including the [[Phokas (Byzantine family)|Phokas]] (10th century) and [[Komnenos]] (11th century), and Renaissance scholars [[George of Trebizond]] (1395\u20131472) and [[Basilios Bessarion]] (1403\u20131472).\n\nThus, when the [[Turkic people]]s began their late medieval conquest of Asia Minor, Byzantine Greek citizens were the largest group of inhabitants there.{{sfn|Travis|2009|p=637}} Even after the Turkic conquests of the interior, the mountainous Black Sea coast of Asia Minor remained the heart of a populous Greek Christian state, the [[Empire of Trebizond]], until its eventual conquest by the Ottoman Turks in 1461, one year after the fall to the Ottomans of the European region now called Greece. Over the next four centuries the Greek natives of Asia Minor gradually became a minority in these lands, as members of their community underwent [[Turkification]], converting to Islam to escape onerous tax obligations and legal limitations imposed on religious minorities, or simply in order to assimilate to the now dominant Turkish culture.<ref name=\" Hanio\u011flu, M. \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc 2010 36 \">{{cite book | author= Hanio\u011flu, M. \u015e\u00fckr\u00fc |title= A Brief History of the Late Ottoman Empire |publisher= Princeton University Press |year= 2010 |page=36 |isbn=978-0-691-14617-1 |quote= The Ottoman state never sought to impose Turkish on subject peoples\u2026Some ethno-religious groups, when outnumbered by Turks, did accept Turkish vernacular through a gradual process of acculturation.

In both cases, certain Ottoman officials, such as [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Kaya]], [[Naz\u0131m Bey]] and [[Mehmed Reshid]], played a role; Special Organization units and labour battalions were involved; and a dual plan was implemented combining unofficial violence and the cover of state population policy.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=94\u201396}} This policy of persecution and ethnic cleansing was expanded to other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], including Greek communities in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Cappadocia]], and [[Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Speros Vryonis |title=The Great Catastrophes: Asia Minor/Smyrna--September 1922; Constantinople-September 6\u20137, 1955 |date=2000 |publisher=Order of Saint Andrew the Apostle |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WYppAAAAMAAJ |quote=In effect this set off the beginning of the persecution of the Greek communities of Asia Minor, an event gradually spread from the Aegean Turkish coast, inland to Pontos and to Cappadocia and Cilicia in the south}}</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n\n[[File:Hellenism in the Near East 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hellenism in Near East during and after [[World War I]], showing some of the areas (Western Anatolia and Eastern Thrace) where the Greek population was concentrated.

Venizelos also threatened to undertake a similar campaign against Muslims that were living in Greece in the event that Ottoman policy did not change.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=99 f}} While the Ottoman government tried to implement this change in policy, it was unsuccessful and attacks, even murders, continued to occur unpunished by local officials in the provinces, despite repeated instructions in cables sent from the central administration.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=100 f}} Arbitrary violence and extortion of money intensified later, providing ammunition for the Venizelists arguing that Greece should join the [[Triple Entente|Entente]].{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=102\u20134}}\n\nIn July 1915 the Greek charg\u00e9 d'affaires claimed that the deportations \"can not be any other issue than an annihilation war against the Greek nation in Turkey and as measures hereof they have been implementing forced conversions to Islam, in obvious aim to, that if after the end of the war there again would be a question of European intervention for the protection of the Christians, there will be as few of them left as possible.\"{{sfn|Avedian|2009|p=40}} According to George W. Rendel of the British Foreign Office, by 1918 \"over 500,000 Greeks were deported of whom comparatively few survived\".{{sfn|Rendel|1922}} In his memoirs, the United States ambassador to the Ottoman Empire between 1913 and 1916 wrote \"Everywhere the Greeks were gathered in groups and, under the so-called protection of Turkish gendarmes, they were transported, the larger part on foot, into the interior. Just how many were scattered in this fashion is not definitely known, the estimates varying anywhere from 200,000 up to 1,000,000.\"{{Sfn|Morgenthau|1919|p=326}}\n\nDespite the shift of policy, the practice of evacuating Greek settlements and relocating the inhabitants was continued, albeit on a limited scale. Relocation was targeted at specific regions that were considered militarily vulnerable, not the whole of the Greek population. As a 1919 Patriarchate account records, the evacuation of many villages was accompanied with looting and murders, while many died as a result of not having been given the time to make the necessary provisions or of being relocated to uninhabitable places.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=105 f}}\n\n[[File:Nygreeks.jpg|thumb|{{Citation | title = Turks Slaughter Christian Greeks | date = 19 October 1917 | newspaper = [[Lincoln Daily Star]]}}]]\n\nState policy towards Ottoman Greeks changed again in the fall of 1916. With Entente forces occupying [[Lesbos]], [[Chios]] and [[Samos]] since spring, the Russians [[Erzurum Offensive|advancing in Anatolia]] and Greece expected to enter the war siding with the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], preparations were made for the deportation of Greeks living in border areas.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=109 f}} In January 1917 Talat Pasha sent a cable for the deportation of Greeks from the [[Samsun]] district \"thirty to fifty kilometres inland\" taking care for \"no assaults on any persons or property\".{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=111}} However, the execution of government decrees, which took a systematic form from December 1916, when [[Behaeddin Shakir]] came to the region, was not conducted as ordered: men were taken in labour battalions, women and children were attacked, villages were looted by Muslim neighbours.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=111 f}}  As such in March 1917 the population of [[Ayvalik]], a town of c. 30,000 inhabitants on the Aegean coast was [[evacuation of Ayvalik|forcibly deported]] to the interior of Anatolia under order by German General [[Otto Liman von Sanders|Liman von Sanders]]. The operation included [[death marches]], looting, torture and massacre against the civilian population.<ref>Ak\u00e7am, 2004, p. 146</ref> [[Germanos Karavangelis]], the bishop of Samsun, reported to the Patriarchate that thirty thousands had been deported to the Ankara region and the convoys of the deportees had been attacked, with many being killed. Talat Pasha ordered an investigation for the looting and destruction of Greek villages by bandits.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=112}} Later in 1917 instructions were sent to authorize military officials with the control of the operation and to broaden its scope, now including persons from cities in the coastal region. However, in certain areas Greek populations remained undeported.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=113}}\n\nGreek deportees were sent to live in Greek villages in the inner provinces or, in some case, villages where Armenians were living before being deported. Greek villages evacuated during the war due to military concerns were then resettled with Muslim immigrants and refugees.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=113\u2013116}} According to cables sent to the provinces during this time, abandoned movable and non-movable Greek property was not to be liquidated, as that of the Armenians, but \"preserved\".{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=116\u2013119}}\n\nOn 14 January 1917 [[Cossva Anckarsv\u00e4rd]], Sweden's Ambassador to Constantinople, sent a dispatch regarding the decision to deport the Ottoman Greeks:\n{{Quote |What above all appears as an unnecessary cruelty is that the deportation is not limited to the men alone, but is extended likewise to women and children.

In 1920, as the Greek army advanced, many were deported to the Mesopotamian desert as had been the Armenians before them. Nevertheless, approximately 1,200,000 Ottoman Greek refugees arrived in Greece at the end of the war. When one adds to the total the Greeks of Constantinople who, by agreement, were not forced to flee, then the total number comes closer to the 1,500,000 Greeks in Anatolia and Thrace. Here, a strong distinction between intention and action is found. According to the Austrian consul at Amisos, Kwiatkowski, in his November 30, 1916, report to foreign minister Baron Burian: 'on 26 November Rafet Bey told me: \"we must finish off the Greeks as we did with the Armenians...\" on 28 November Rafet Bey told me: \"today I sent squads to the interior to kill every Greek on sight.\" I fear for the elimination of the entire Greek population and a repeat of what occurred last year.' Or according to a January 31, 1917, report by Chancellor Hollweg of Austria: the indications are that the Turks plan to eliminate the Greek element as enemies of the state, as they did earlier with the Armenians. The strategy implemented by the Turks is of displacing people to the interior without taking measures for their survival by exposing them to death, hunger, and illness. The abandoned homes are then looted and burnt or destroyed. Whatever was done to the Armenians is being repeated with the Greeks. Massacres most likely did take place at Amisos and other villages in Pontus. Yet given the large number of surviving Greeks, especially relative to the small number of Armenian survivors, the massacres apparently were restricted to Pontus, Smyrna, and selected other 'sensitive' regions.}}</ref>\n\nPontic Greeks responded by forming insurgent groups, which carried weapons salvaged from the battlefields of the Caucasus Campaign of World War I or directly supplied by the Russian army.

minorities who could threaten the integrity of an ethnically-based Turkish nation.{{sfn|Bloxham|2005|p=[https://archive.org/details/greatgameofgenoc00blox/page/150 150]}}{{sfn|Levene|1998}}{{Rp |

In both cases, certain Ottoman officials, such as [[\u015e\u00fckr\u00fc Kaya]], [[Naz\u0131m Bey]] and [[Mehmed Reshid]], played a role; Special Organization units and labour battalions were involved; and a dual plan was implemented combining unofficial violence and the cover of state population policy.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=94\u201396}} This policy of persecution and ethnic cleansing was expanded to other parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]], including Greek communities in [[Pontus (region)|Pontus]], [[Cappadocia]], and [[Cilicia]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Speros Vryonis |title=The Great Catastrophes: Asia Minor/Smyrna--September 1922; Constantinople-September 6\u20137, 1955 |date=2000 |publisher=Order of Saint Andrew the Apostle |url=https://books.google.com/?id=WYppAAAAMAAJ |quote=In effect this set off the beginning of the persecution of the Greek communities of Asia Minor, an event gradually spread from the Aegean Turkish coast, inland to Pontos and to Cappadocia and Cilicia in the south}}</ref>\n\n===World War I===\n\n[[File:Hellenism in the Near East 1918.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Hellenism in Near East during and after [[World War I]], showing some of the areas (Western Anatolia and Eastern Thrace) where the Greek population was concentrated.

Venizelos also threatened to undertake a similar campaign against Muslims that were living in Greece in the event that Ottoman policy did not change.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=99 f}} While the Ottoman government tried to implement this change in policy, it was unsuccessful and attacks, even murders, continued to occur unpunished by local officials in the provinces, despite repeated instructions in cables sent from the central administration.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=100 f}} Arbitrary violence and extortion of money intensified later, providing ammunition for the Venizelists arguing that Greece should join the [[Triple Entente|Entente]].{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=102\u20134}}\n\nIn July 1915 the Greek charg\u00e9 d'affaires claimed that the deportations \"can not be any other issue than an annihilation war against the Greek nation in Turkey and as measures hereof they have been implementing forced conversions to Islam, in obvious aim to, that if after the end of the war there again would be a question of European intervention for the protection of the Christians, there will be as few of them left as possible.\"{{sfn|Avedian|2009|p=40}} According to George W. Rendel of the British Foreign Office, by 1918 \"over 500,000 Greeks were deported of whom comparatively few survived\".{{sfn|Rendel|1922}} In his memoirs, the United States ambassador to the Ottoman Empire between 1913 and 1916 wrote \"Everywhere the Greeks were gathered in groups and, under the so-called protection of Turkish gendarmes, they were transported, the larger part on foot, into the interior. Just how many were scattered in this fashion is not definitely known, the estimates varying anywhere from 200,000 up to 1,000,000.\"{{Sfn|Morgenthau|1919|p=326}}\n\nDespite the shift of policy, the practice of evacuating Greek settlements and relocating the inhabitants was continued, albeit on a limited scale. Relocation was targeted at specific regions that were considered militarily vulnerable, not the whole of the Greek population. As a 1919 Patriarchate account records, the evacuation of many villages was accompanied with looting and murders, while many died as a result of not having been given the time to make the necessary provisions or of being relocated to uninhabitable places.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=105 f}}\n\n[[File:Nygreeks.jpg|thumb|{{Citation | title = Turks Slaughter Christian Greeks | date = 19 October 1917 | newspaper = [[Lincoln Daily Star]]}}]]\n\nState policy towards Ottoman Greeks changed again in the fall of 1916. With Entente forces occupying [[Lesbos]], [[Chios]] and [[Samos]] since spring, the Russians [[Erzurum Offensive|advancing in Anatolia]] and Greece expected to enter the war siding with the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], preparations were made for the deportation of Greeks living in border areas.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=109 f}} In January 1917 Talat Pasha sent a cable for the deportation of Greeks from the [[Samsun]] district \"thirty to fifty kilometres inland\" taking care for \"no assaults on any persons or property\".{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=111}} However, the execution of government decrees, which took a systematic form from December 1916, when [[Behaeddin Shakir]] came to the region, was not conducted as ordered: men were taken in labour battalions, women and children were attacked, villages were looted by Muslim neighbours.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=111 f}}  As such in March 1917 the population of [[Ayvalik]], a town of c. 30,000 inhabitants on the Aegean coast was [[evacuation of Ayvalik|forcibly deported]] to the interior of Anatolia under order by German General [[Otto Liman von Sanders|Liman von Sanders]]. The operation included [[death marches]], looting, torture and massacre against the civilian population.<ref>Ak\u00e7am, 2004, p. 146</ref> [[Germanos Karavangelis]], the bishop of Samsun, reported to the Patriarchate that thirty thousands had been deported to the Ankara region and the convoys of the deportees had been attacked, with many being killed. Talat Pasha ordered an investigation for the looting and destruction of Greek villages by bandits.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=112}} Later in 1917 instructions were sent to authorize military officials with the control of the operation and to broaden its scope, now including persons from cities in the coastal region. However, in certain areas Greek populations remained undeported.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=113}}\n\nGreek deportees were sent to live in Greek villages in the inner provinces or, in some case, villages where Armenians were living before being deported. Greek villages evacuated during the war due to military concerns were then resettled with Muslim immigrants and refugees.{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=113\u2013116}} According to cables sent to the provinces during this time, abandoned movable and non-movable Greek property was not to be liquidated, as that of the Armenians, but \"preserved\".{{sfn|Ak\u00e7am|2012|pp=116\u2013119}}\n\nOn 14 January 1917 [[Cossva Anckarsv\u00e4rd]], Sweden's Ambassador to Constantinople, sent a dispatch regarding the decision to deport the Ottoman Greeks:\n{{Quote |What above all appears as an unnecessary cruelty is that the deportation is not limited to the men alone, but is extended likewise to women and children.

Especially poorly treated were the Pontic Greeks in eastern Anatolia on the Black Sea. In 1920, as the Greek army advanced, many were deported to the Mesopotamian desert as had been the Armenians before them. Nevertheless, approximately 1,200,000 Ottoman Greek refugees arrived in Greece at the end of the war. When one adds to the total the Greeks of Constantinople who, by agreement, were not forced to flee, then the total number comes closer to the 1,500,000 Greeks in Anatolia and Thrace. Here, a strong distinction between intention and action is found. According to the Austrian consul at Amisos, Kwiatkowski, in his November 30, 1916, report to foreign minister Baron Burian: 'on 26 November Rafet Bey told me: \"we must finish off the Greeks as we did with the Armenians...\" on 28 November Rafet Bey told me: \"today I sent squads to the interior to kill every Greek on sight.\" I fear for the elimination of the entire Greek population and a repeat of what occurred last year.' Or according to a January 31, 1917, report by Chancellor Hollweg of Austria: the indications are that the Turks plan to eliminate the Greek element as enemies of the state, as they did earlier with the Armenians. The strategy implemented by the Turks is of displacing people to the interior without taking measures for their survival by exposing them to death, hunger, and illness. The abandoned homes are then looted and burnt or destroyed. Whatever was done to the Armenians is being repeated with the Greeks. Massacres most likely did take place at Amisos and other villages in Pontus. Yet given the large number of surviving Greeks, especially relative to the small number of Armenian survivors, the massacres apparently were restricted to Pontus, Smyrna, and selected other 'sensitive' regions.}}</ref>\n\nPontic Greeks responded by forming insurgent groups, which carried weapons salvaged from the battlefields of the Caucasus Campaign of World War I or directly supplied by the Russian army. In 1920, the insurgents reached their peak in regard to manpower numbering 18,000 men.{{sfn|Agtzidis|1992|pp=164\u2013165}} On 15 November 1917, [[Ozakom]] delegates agreed to create a unified army composed of ethnically homogeneous units, Greeks were allotted a division consisting of three regiments.
