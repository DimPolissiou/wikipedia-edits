It is a special case of [[sum-frequency generation]] (2 photons), and more generally of [[harmonic generation]].\n\nThe second-order [[nonlinear susceptibility]] of a medium characterizes its tendency to cause SHG. Second-harmonic generation, like other even-order nonlinear optical phenomena, is not allowed in media with inversion symmetry.<ref name=Boyd2007>{{cite book|language=en |title= Nonlinear optics (third edition) | chapter = The Nonlinear Optical Susceptibility |year=2007|last1=Boyd|first1= R. |pages=1\u201367| doi = 10.1016/B978-0-12-369470-6.00001-0|isbn= 9780123694706 }}</ref> However, effects such as the [[Bloch\u2013Siegert shift]] (oscillation), found when two-level systems are driven at Rabi frequencies comparable to their transition frequencies, will give rise to second harmonic generation in centro-symmetric systems.\n<ref>{{cite journal |\n last1 = Cardoso |\n first1 = G.C. |\n last2 = Pradhan |\n first2 = P. |\n last3 =  Morzinski |\n first3 = J. |\n last4 =  Shahriar |\n first4 = M.S. |\n year = 2005 |\n title =  In situ detection of the temporal and initial phase of the second harmonic of a microwave field via incoherent fluorescence |\n journal = Physical Review A |\n volume = 71 |\n issue = 6|\n pages = 063408 |\n doi = 10.1103/PhysRevA.71.063408|\n arxiv = quant-ph/0410219 }}\n</ref>\n<ref>{{cite journal |\n last1 = Pradhan |\n first1 = P. |\n last2 = Cardoso |\n first2 = G.C. |\n last3 =  Shahriar |\n first3 = M.S. |\n year = 2009 |\n title =  Suppression of error in qubit rotations due to Bloch\u2013Siegert oscillation via the use of off-resonant Raman excitation |\n journal = Journal of Physics B: Atomic, Molecular and Optical Physics  |\n volume = 42 |\n issue = 6|\n pages = 065501  |\n doi = 10.1088/0953-4075/42/6/065501}}\n</ref>\n\nIn some cases, almost 100% of the light energy can be converted to the second harmonic frequency. These cases typically involve intense pulsed laser beams passing through large crystals, and careful alignment to obtain [[phase matching]]. In other cases, like [[second-harmonic imaging microscopy]], only a tiny fraction of the light energy is converted to the second harmonic\u2014but this light can nevertheless be detected with the help of [[optical filter]]s.\n\n[[File:Schematic of the SHG conversion of an excited wave in a non-linear medium.png|300px|Schematic view of the SHG conversion of an exciting wave in a non-linear medium with a non-zero second-order non-linear susceptibility.]]\n\nGenerating the second harmonic, often called frequency doubling, is also a process in radio communication; it was developed early in the 20th century, and has been used with frequencies in the megahertz range. It is a special case of [[Frequency multiplier|frequency multiplication]].\n\n[[File:Electron asymmetric motion animation.gif|thumb|300px|An electron (purple) is being pushed side-to-side by a [[sinusoid]]ally-oscillating force, i.e. the light's electric field.

They focused a ruby laser with a wavelength of 694&nbsp;nm into a quartz sample. They sent the output light through a [[spectrometer]], recording the spectrum on photographic paper, which indicated the production of light at 347&nbsp;nm.

In ''Type 0 SHG'' two photons having [[extraordinary polarization]] with respect to the crystal will combine to form a single photon with double the frequency/energy and extraordinary polarization. In ''Type I SHG'' two photons having [[ordinary polarization]] with respect to the crystal will combine to form one photon with double the frequency and extraordinary polarization. In ''Type II SHG'', two photons having orthogonal polarizations will combine to form one photon with double the frequency and ordinary polarization. For a given crystal orientation, only one of these types of SHG occurs. In general to utilise ''Type 0'' interactions a [[quasi-phase-matching]] crystal type will be required, for example periodically poled lithium niobate (PPLN).\n[[Image:Second Harmonic Generation.svg|512px|thumb|right|Diagram of the second-harmonic generation process.]]\n\n===Non-critical phase-matching===\n\nSince phase-matching process basically means to adapt the optical indices n at \u03c9 and 2\u03c9, it can also be done by a temperature control in some birefringent crystals, because n changes with the temperature.

In fact, second-harmonic generation and sum frequency generation discriminate against signals from the bulk, implicitly labeling them as surface specific techniques. In 1982, T. F. Heinz and Y. R. Shen explicitly demonstrated for the first time that SHG could be used as a spectroscopic technique to probe molecular monolayers adsorbed to surfaces.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Heinz | first1 = T.

In high-quality diode lasers the crystal is coated on the output side with an infrared filter to prevent leakage of intense 1064&nbsp;nm or 808&nbsp;nm infrared light into the beam. Both of these wavelengths are invisible and do not trigger the defensive \"blink-reflex\" reaction in the eye and can therefore be a special hazard to the human eyes. Furthermore, some laser safety eyewear intended for argon or other green lasers may filter out the green component (giving a false sense of safety), but transmit the infrared. Nevertheless, some \"green [[laser pointer]]\" products have become available on the market which omit the expensive infrared filter, often without warning.<ref>[http://www.wickedlasers.com/laser-tech/WhyisIRbad.html A warning about IR in green cheap green laser pointers]</ref> Second-harmonic generation is also used for measuring ultra short pulse width with [[autocorrelator]]s.\n\n==Other applications==\n\n=== Ultra-short pulse measurement ===\nCharacterizing an ultrashort pulse (like measuring its temporal width) cannot be done directly with electronics only, as the time-scale is below 1ps (<math>10^{-12}</math>sec) : it needs to use the pulse itself, that is why an autocorrelation function is often used.
