''Chronic Town'' is the first illustration of R.E.M.'s signature musical style: jangling guitars, chords played in [[arpeggio]], murmured vocals, and obscure lyrics.\n\n==Background and recording==\nAfter the minor success of the group's debut single \"[[Radio Free Europe (song)|Radio Free Europe]]\" in 1981, R.E.M. manager [[Jefferson Holt]] felt the band was ready to record a longer release. While he felt they were not ready to record a full album, Holt figured an EP would be satisfactory.<ref>Buckey, p. 58</ref> The band was uncertain at first if they would record with producer [[Mitch Easter]] (who had produced \"Radio Free Europe\"), but Easter managed to convince Holt and the band to let him produce it.\n\nIn October 1981, R.E.M. spent a weekend at Easter's Drive-In Studios recording the EP.<ref name=\"buckley59\">Buckley, p. 59</ref> Easter was a fan of the [[Krautrock]] band [[Kraftwerk]], which inspired him to try various sonic experiments while recording. Easter incorporated tape loops and recorded singer [[Michael Stipe]] singing outdoors.<ref>Buckley, p. 60</ref> The band was open to such experimentation and used the sessions as an opportunity to learn how to use a studio.<ref>Platt, John. \"R.E.M.\" ''[[Bucketfull of Brains]]''.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District. All available testimony shows that he was present only during the few weeks early in 1791 when the rough preliminary survey of the ten mile square was made; that, after this was concluded and before the final survey was begun, he returned to his farm and his astronomical studies in April, accompanying Ellicott part way on his brief journey back to Philadelphia; and that thenceforth he had no connection with the mapping of the seat of government. ...<br>In any case, Banneker's participation in the surveying of the Federal District was unquestionably brief and his role uncertain.}}</ref> An April 21, 1791, news report of the April 15 dedication ceremony for the first boundary stone (the south cornerstone) stated that it was Andrew Ellicott who \"ascertained the precise point from which the first line of the district was to proceed\".<ref>(1) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|quote=When Mr. Ellicott had ascertained the precise point from which the line of the district was to proceed, the Master of the Lodge and Dr. Stewart, assisted by others of their brethren placed the stone; ... |via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org]}}<br />(2) Bedini, 1971, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/124/mode/1up 124],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00silv/page/314/mode/1up 314]</ref>  The news report did not mention Banneker's name.<ref>(1) [https://web.archive.org/web/20130322112050/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/rchs_1969.pdf Bedini, 1969, p. 25.]<br>(2) {{cite news|location=Boston, Massachusetts|publisher=Benjamin Russell|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160630220952/http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|archivedate=2016-06-30|url=http://www.boundarystones.org/articles/columbian_centinel_1791.pdf|title=New Federal City|work=Columbian Centennial|number=744|date=1791-05-07|accessdate=2016-10-09|via=[http://www.boundarystones.org boundarystones.org}}]</ref>\n\nBanneker left the boundary survey in April 1791 within three months of its initiation because of concerns about his health and the difficulties in completing the survey at age 59.<ref name=Bedini136>Bedini, 1999, pp. [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/132/mode/1up 132],  [https://archive.org/details/lifeofbenjaminba00bedi/page/136/mode/1up 136].</ref> In addition, Andrew Ellicott's younger brothers, [[Benjamin Ellicott|Benjamin]] and [[Joseph Ellicott]], who usually assisted Andrew, were able to join the survey at that time.<ref name=Bedini136/> Banneker therefore returned to his home near Ellicott's Mills.<ref name=Glawe/><ref name=Bedini136/> The Ellicotts and other members of the surveying team then laid the remaining Virginia marker stones later in 1791.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family. It stayed there, away from the public's eye until 1987 when Ellicott family descendant Dorothea West Fitzhugh donated it in honor of her late husband Robert Tyson Fitzhugh.

Born in [[Baltimore County, Maryland]], to a free African-American woman and a former [[slavery|slave]], Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught. He is known for being part of a group led by [[Andrew Ellicott (surveyor)|Major Andrew Ellicott]] that surveyed the original borders of the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], the federal capital district of the [[United States]].\n\nBanneker's knowledge of [[astronomy]] helped him author a commercially successful series of almanacs. He corresponded with [[Thomas Jefferson]] on the topics of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and [[racial equality]], Jefferson having earlier [[Draft document|draft]]ed the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]. [[Abolitionism in the United States|Abolitionist]]s and advocates of racial equality promoted and praised Banneker's works.\n\nAlthough a fire on the day of Banneker's funeral destroyed many of his papers and belongings, one of his journals and several of his remaining [[Cultural artifact|artifacts]] are presently available for public viewing. Parks, schools, streets and other tributes have commemorated Banneker throughout the years since he lived. However, many accounts of his life exaggerate or falsely attribute his works.\n\n==Early life==\nBenjamin Banneker was born on November 9, 1731, in Baltimore County, Maryland to Mary Banneky, a free black, and Robert, a [[Freedman|freed slave]] from [[Guinea]].<ref name=Bedini2008>[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx Bedini, 2008] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203192640/http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Benjamin_Banneker.aspx |date=2016-02-03}}</ref> There are two conflicting accounts of Banneker's family history.

The single notable exception is Silvio A. Bedini's ''The Life of Benjamin Banneker'' (New York, 1972), a work of painstaking research and scrupulous attention to accuracy which also benefits from the author's discovery of important and hitherto unavailable manuscript sources. However, as Bedini points out, the story of Banneker's involvement in the survey of the Federal District \"rests on extremely meager documentation\" (p. 104). This consists of a single mention by TJ, two brief statements by Banneker himself, and the newspaper allusion quoted above. In consequence, Bedini's otherwise reliable biography accepts the version of Banneker's role in this episode as presented in reminiscences of nineteenth-century authors. These recollections, deriving in large part from members of the Ellicott family, who were prompted by Quaker inclinations to justice and equality, have compounded the confusion. The nature of TJ's connection with Banneker is treated in the Editorial Note to the group of documents under 30 Aug. 1791, but because of the obscured record it is necessary here to attempt a clarification of the role of this modest, self-taught tobacco farmer in the laying out of the national capital.<br>First of all, because of unwarranted claims to the contrary, it must be pointed out that there is no evidence whatever that Banneker had anything to do with the survey of the Federal City or indeed with the final establishment of the boundaries of the Federal District.

BENJAMIN BANNEKER, a free black, is about fifty-nine years of age; he was born in Baltimore county; his father was an African, and his mother the offspring of African parents. \u2013  His father and mother having obtained their freedom, were enabled to send him to an obscure school, where he learned, when a boy, reading, writing, and arithmetic as far as double position; and to leave him, at their deaths, a few acres of land, upon which he has supported himself ever since by means of economy and constant labour, and preserved a fair reputation. To struggle incessantly against want is no ways favourable to improvement: what he had learned, however, he did not forget; for as some hours of leisure will occur in the most toilsome life, he availed himself of these, not to read and acquire knowledge from writings of genius and discovery, for of such he had none, but to digest and apply, as occasions presented, the few principles of the few rules of arithmetic he had been taught at school. This kind of mental exercise formed his chief amusement, and soon gave him a facility in calculation that was often serviceable to his neighbours, and at length attracted the attention of the Messrs. Ellicott, a family remarkable for their ingenuity and turn to the useful mechanics. It is about three years since Mr. George Ellicott lent him Mayer's Tables, Ferguson's Astronomy, Leadbeater's Lunar Tables, and some astronomic instruments, but without accompanying them with either hint or instruction, that might further his studies, or lead him to apply them to any useful result. These books and instruments, the first of the kind he had ever seen, opened a new world to Benjamin, and from thenceforward he employed his leisure in astronomical researches. He now took up the idea of the calculations for an Almanack, and actually completed an entire set for the last year, upon his original stock of arithmetic. Encouraged by this first attempt, he entered upon his calculation for 1792, which, as well as the former, he began and finished without the least information of assistance from any person, or other books than those I have mentioned; so that whatever merit is attached to his present performance, is exclusively and peculiarly his own. I have been the more careful to investigate those particulars, and to ascertain their reality, as they form an interesting fact in the History of Man; and as you may want them to gratify curiosity, I have no objection to your selecting them for your account of Benjamin.\"<br>(5) {{cite book|title=Letter from James McHenry regarding Benjamin Banneker|location=Baltimore, April 20, 1791}} ''In''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false Phillips, pp. 115\u2013116] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160517183823/https://books.google.com/books?id=LSkkCeq5R1AC&pg=PA114#v=onepage&q&f=false |date=2016-05-17 }}. \"The following notice of Banneker is found, first published in his almanac for 1792, and republished with some abridgement in the one of 1793, from which we are making extracts.

On his instruction, the astronomical journal and some other loose manuscripts were removed upon his death and left to George Ellicott (1760\u20131832). The journal stayed in the hands of the Ellicott family until 1844 when it was deposited here at MdHS, where it was used by John H.B. Latrobe the following year. Quaker philanthropist and MdHS member [[Moses Sheppard]] (1771\u20131857) had the book rebound in Russian leather in 1852, and at this date most likely combined the astronomical journal with some of Banneker's loose manuscripts as well as a day book. At some unknown date the astronomical journal left MdHS and returned to the hands of the Ellicott family.

His books include ''Lizard Music'', ''The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death'', ''Fat Men from Space'', ''[[Borgel]]'', and the picture book ''[[The Big Orange Splot]]''. He has also written an adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', and essay collections derived from his talks on [[National Public Radio]].\n\nMany elements of his fiction are based on real events and people he encountered in his youth.\n\nPinkwater is a trained artist and has illustrated many of his books, but for more recent works, that task has passed to his wife, Jill Pinkwater. His artistic technique varies from work to work, with some books illustrated in computer drawings, others in woodcuts and others in Magic Marker.\n\nPinkwater varies his name slightly between books (for instance, \"Daniel Pinkwater\", \"Daniel M. Pinkwater\", \"Daniel Manus Pinkwater\", \"D. Manus Pinkwater\").\n\nHe was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrant parents from [[Poland]].  He describes his father as a \"ham-eating, iconoclastic Jew.\" His parents moved to [[Chicago]], where he grew up. He attended [[Bard College]].\n\n==Themes==\nPinkwater tends to write about social misfits who find themselves in bizarre situations, such as searching for a floating island populated by human-sized intelligent lizards (''Lizard Music''), exploring other universes with an obscure relative (''[[Borgel]]''), or discovering that their teeth can function as interstellar [[radio]] antennae (''Fat Men from Space'').  They are often, though not always, set in thinly\u2014or not at all\u2014disguised versions of Chicago and [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  He often includes Chicago landmarks and folkloric figures from his childhood in 1950s Chicago, regardless of when the book is set. An example of this is the recurring character the Chicken Man, a mysterious but dignified black man who carries a performing chicken on his head.  This character is based on a shadowy figure from 1950s Chicago; after Pinkwater made him a lead character in ''Lizard Music'' he received letters from Chicago residents who remembered the Chicken Man.  Pinkwater also pays tribute to the Clark Theater (a repertory movie theatre on Clark Street in the [[Chicago Loop]] that changed features daily and stayed open all night), [[Bughouse Square]], and Ed & Fred's Red Hots.  Another common theme is Jewish culture, with characters incongruously speaking in [[Yiddish]]-influenced dialogue or participating in [[Borscht Belt]] culture. Characters sometimes have surnames that append the \"-stein\" element familiar in some Jewish names to names suggesting other ethnicities (e.g., \"Wentworthstein\").\n\nIn 1995, Pinkwater published his first adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', in which a mediocre editor, upon dying, finds himself in a tacky [[Catskills]] resort populated by \"circumferentially challenged\" deceased.\n\n==Comics and radio==\nPinkwater authored the newspaper comic strip ''[[Norb (comic)|Norb]]'', which was illustrated by [[Tony Auth]].  The strip, syndicated by [[King Features]], was cancelled after 52 weeks.<ref>\n[http://www.toonopedia.com/norb.htm Norb] ''Don Markstein's Toonopedia'',  accessed on May 10, 2007.</ref>  The daily strips were released in a 78-page collection by [[MU Press]] in 1992.\n\nPinkwater is also a longtime commentator on [[National Public Radio]].  He regularly reviews children's books on NPR's ''Weekend Edition Saturday''.  For several years, he had his own NPR show: ''Chinwag Theater''.  Pinkwater is also known to avid fans of the NPR radio show ''[[Car Talk]]'', where he has appeared as a (seemingly) random caller, commenting, for example, on the physics of the buttocks (giving rise to the proposed unit of measure of seat size: the Pinkwater), and giving practical advice as to the choice of [[automobile]]s.  In the early 1990s Pinkwater voiced a series of humorous radio advertisements for the Ford Motor Company.\n\n==Challenged book==\nFollowing an appearance by Pinkwater on the [[Public Radio International]] program ''[[This American Life]]'',<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/43/faustian-bargains?act=4 This American Life episode #43: Faustian Bargains], broadcast 22 November 1996.

His books include ''Lizard Music'', ''The Snarkout Boys and the Avocado of Death'', ''Fat Men from Space'', ''[[Borgel]]'', and the picture book ''[[The Big Orange Splot]]''. He has also written an adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', and essay collections derived from his talks on [[National Public Radio]].\n\nMany elements of his fiction are based on real events and people he encountered in his youth.\n\nPinkwater is a trained artist and has illustrated many of his books, but for more recent works, that task has passed to his wife, Jill Pinkwater. His artistic technique varies from work to work, with some books illustrated in computer drawings, others in woodcuts and others in Magic Marker.\n\nPinkwater varies his name slightly between books (for instance, \"Daniel Pinkwater\", \"Daniel M. Pinkwater\", \"Daniel Manus Pinkwater\", \"D. Manus Pinkwater\").\n\nHe was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], to [[Judaism|Jewish]] immigrant parents from [[Poland]].  He describes his father as a \"ham-eating, iconoclastic Jew.\" His parents moved to [[Chicago]], where he grew up. He attended [[Bard College]].\n\n==Themes==\nPinkwater tends to write about social misfits who find themselves in bizarre situations, such as searching for a floating island populated by human-sized intelligent lizards (''Lizard Music''), exploring other universes with an obscure relative (''[[Borgel]]''), or discovering that their teeth can function as interstellar [[radio]] antennae (''Fat Men from Space'').  They are often, though not always, set in thinly\u2014or not at all\u2014disguised versions of Chicago and [[Hoboken, New Jersey]].  He often includes Chicago landmarks and folkloric figures from his childhood in 1950s Chicago, regardless of when the book is set. An example of this is the recurring character the Chicken Man, a mysterious but dignified black man who carries a performing chicken on his head.  This character is based on a shadowy figure from 1950s Chicago; after Pinkwater made him a lead character in ''Lizard Music'' he received letters from Chicago residents who remembered the Chicken Man.  Pinkwater also pays tribute to the Clark Theater (a repertory movie theatre on Clark Street in the [[Chicago Loop]] that changed features daily and stayed open all night), [[Bughouse Square]], and Ed & Fred's Red Hots.  Another common theme is Jewish culture, with characters incongruously speaking in [[Yiddish]]-influenced dialogue or participating in [[Borscht Belt]] culture. Characters sometimes have surnames that append the \"-stein\" element familiar in some Jewish names to names suggesting other ethnicities (e.g., \"Wentworthstein\").\n\nIn 1995, Pinkwater published his first adult novel, ''The Afterlife Diet'', in which a mediocre editor, upon dying, finds himself in a tacky [[Catskills]] resort populated by \"circumferentially challenged\" deceased.\n\n==Comics and radio==\nPinkwater authored the newspaper comic strip ''[[Norb (comic)|Norb]]'', which was illustrated by [[Tony Auth]].  The strip, syndicated by [[King Features]], was cancelled after 52 weeks.<ref>\n[http://www.toonopedia.com/norb.htm Norb] ''Don Markstein's Toonopedia'',  accessed on May 10, 2007.</ref>  The daily strips were released in a 78-page collection by [[MU Press]] in 1992.\n\nPinkwater is also a longtime commentator on [[National Public Radio]].  He regularly reviews children's books on NPR's ''Weekend Edition Saturday''.  For several years, he had his own NPR show: ''Chinwag Theater''.  Pinkwater is also known to avid fans of the NPR radio show ''[[Car Talk]]'', where he has appeared as a (seemingly) random caller, commenting, for example, on the physics of the buttocks (giving rise to the proposed unit of measure of seat size: the Pinkwater), and giving practical advice as to the choice of [[automobile]]s.  In the early 1990s Pinkwater voiced a series of humorous radio advertisements for the Ford Motor Company.\n\n==Challenged book==\nFollowing an appearance by Pinkwater on the [[Public Radio International]] program ''[[This American Life]]'',<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/43/faustian-bargains?act=4 This American Life episode #43: Faustian Bargains], broadcast 22 November 1996.

The campaign began with the Japanese [[bombing of Darwin]] on 19 February 1942 and continued until the end of the war.\n\nWhile the Japanese attack on Darwin inflicted heavy damage on the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) base there, the Allies quickly recovered. Darwin was reinforced to meet the [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|perceived threat of invasion]] and additional airfields were built to the south of the town. By October 1942 the RAAF's [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area Command]] had been built up to six squadrons, and was conducting daily attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI.<ref name=\"Coates_p270\">{{cite book|last=Coates|title=An Atlas of Australia's Wars|year=2006|pages=270|isbn=0-19-555914-2}}</ref>\n\nThe Allied force continued to expand in 1943 with the arrival of [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[B-24 Liberator]] heavy bomber units, Australian and British [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] squadrons and Australian and Dutch medium bomber squadrons.

The convoy had left [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] without air cover and was forced to return the following day, having failed to reinforce the Allied garrison on [[Timor]]. The Japanese flying boat located the convoy at 10.30&nbsp;a.m. and maintained visual contact for a further three hours. When it was about 190&nbsp;kilometres west of Darwin the H6K made an unsuccessful bombing attack on the vessels before turning for home. Soon afterwards, however, the flying boat was spotted by an American [[Curtiss P-40|Kittyhawk]] fighter, piloted by [http://clarkjanson.com/histories/PERES,%20Jack%20incident%20report.pdf Lieutenant Robert Buel], who then made a diving attack on the Japanese aircraft. After a brief exchange of gunfire both aircraft caught fire and crashed into the sea, thus ending the first aerial combat of the northern Australian air war.<ref group=Note>2nd Lt Robert J Buel's P-40E (#54 White) belonged to the 3rd Pursuit Squadron (Provisional).</ref>\n\nThis was the first of many Japanese aircraft to be shot down over north Australia or within Australian territorial waters during World War II. For nearly two and a half years following this initial engagement, Japanese Army and Naval Air Forces maintained a constant surveillance of northern Australia, ranging from [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] on the west coast to [[Horn Island, Queensland|Horn Island]] in north Queensland. For much of this time Australia was also being subjected to regular, full-scale bombing attacks by land-based bombers which were stationed barely a few hours away from the strategic port of Darwin in the Northern Territory.\n\nBy early 1942 the Japanese had assembled a force of nearly 130 aircraft in the islands to the north-west of Darwin. This force, comprising sixty-three [[Mitsubishi G4M|Mitsubishi G4M (Betty) bombers]], forty-eight [[Mitsubishi Zero|Mitsubishi A6M (Zero)]] fighters, and eighteen four-engined flying boats, had been assembled from elements of the [http://www.navweaps.com/index_oob/OOB_WWII_Pacific/OOB_WWII_Combined_Fleet.htm 21st and 23rd Air Flotillas] which had already participated in the [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u20131942)|Philippines campaign]] and the sinking of the [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|British battleships HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']].<ref group=Note>The Allied code-names which appear in parentheses will be used hereafter to distinguish between different types of Japanese aircraft.</ref> From bases in [[Java]], Timor, [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], and [[New Guinea]], the Japanese attacked every operational airfield in the northern and north-western parts of Australia, including the strategically important Allied airfields at [[Townsville]] and [[Horn Island, Queensland|Horn Island]] in north Queensland. The Allied supply ships that plied the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Torres Strait]] were also vulnerable to these attacks.\n\n====Raids on Darwin====\n{{main|Bombing of Darwin}}\nDarwin bore the brunt of these devastating attacks which began on [http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/darwin02.htm 19 February 1942]. The first two Japanese air raids against Darwin, and the events which followed, represent the most humiliating moments in Australia's military history. The Allied command had failed to appreciate the significance of the Japanese buildup to the north-west of Darwin, despite the pattern of recent events at [[Pearl Harbor attack|Pearl Harbor]], [[Fall of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|Rabaul]]. The port was without fighter defences and the army garrison consisted of just two brigades. Darwin harbour had become choked with vulnerable naval and merchant vessels, defended by an anti-aircraft battery of only eighteen guns.\n\nThe first Darwin air raid was followed by an outbreak of widespread military and civil disorder which, fuelled by rumours of Japanese invasion, soon led to a state of panic. Since this was also the largest ever attack against the Australian mainland, most historical discussions about the war in northern Australia tended to concentrate on these first surprise attacks against Darwin. By treating these events in isolation, however, 20th-century historians such as [[Douglas Lockwood]] and [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2914311 Timothy Hall] have unwittingly reinforced the notion that these early raids on Australia \u2013 and Darwin \u2013 were isolated incidents conducted opportunistically and in no way related to, say, the later raids against Broome, [http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/mill02.htm Millingimbi] or Horn Island.<ref>Lockwood. Douglas. ''Australia's Pearl Harbour'', Melbourne, 1966; Hall, Timothy.''Darwin 1942, Australia's Darkest Hour'', Melbourne, 1980.</ref>\n\nThe Japanese air raids against mainland Australia, though very wide-ranging and seemingly unrelated in strategic terms, did in fact have considerable impact on [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur's]] south-west Pacific strategies, particularly during 1942. The threat of Japanese invasion forced the Allies to defend the northern, and to a lesser extent the eastern, approaches to mainland Australia. This was done, initially at least, at the expense of the New Guinea campaign. Although Darwin had been attacked by an aerial force numerically equivalent to that which had paralysed the American Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, the main thrust of the Allied war effort was then being directed towards the defence of Port Moresby which, until then, had been subjected to just a few, ineffectual nuisance raids.\n\nMacArthur viewed the threat to northern Australia with such seriousness that he ordered his first operational fighter squadron be sent to Darwin, rather than Port Moresby. As more fighter squadrons became available they were sent immediately to the Northern Territory and it was late April 1942 before Port Moresby's fighter defences equalled those of Darwin. Early warning [http://www.qsl.net/vk2dym/radio/RS31_Radara.htm radar] systems were in very short supply during 1942, yet again Darwin received priority over Port Moresby.\n\n====Japanese offensive in the North-Western Area====\nBy maintaining their offensive stance in the North-Western Area, the Japanese were also presenting a threat to the vulnerable western approaches to New Guinea. This region lay on the flank of MacArthur's main concentrations and had to be adequately protected to ensure the success of his projected offensive. However MacArthur rated the prospect of a Japanese assault on mainland Australia, he could not afford to overlook the unquestionable superiority of Japanese air strength in Timor, Java, and Celebes. By May 1943, the Japanese had developed almost sixty-seven airfields in the arc of islands around Australia. An Allied General Headquarters report of 14 March 1943 had estimated that a total of 334 Japanese aircraft could be deployed to the north-west of Australia.<ref>Odgers, George. ''Australia in the War of 1939\u20131945, Air War  Against Japan 1943\u20131945'', Canberra, 1957, p. 38.</ref> Such was the significance of the threat to the region that eleven squadrons, which included three of MacArthur's highly valued heavy bombardment squadrons, had been committed to the region's defence by August 1943. The buildup of air defences was to continue and by July 1944, when the last Japanese aircraft had been shot down over Australia, there were seventeen squadrons participating in the defence of northern Australia.\n\nWhen viewed in this context, the war in northern Australia amounts to much more than just another Pearl Harbor. The latter was an isolated strike directed primarily against the capital ships of the [[United States Pacific Fleet]]. Offensive operations against northern Australia, on the other hand, continued until late 1943, and were directed against a wide variety of land-based targets as well as merchant shipping. Darwin was probably, after Port Moresby, the most frequently bombed Allied base in the south-west Pacific. For almost two years the Japanese Air Force was able to maintain a bomber offensive which significantly disrupted and delayed the Allied war effort, whilst simultaneously causing considerable anxiety within the Australian civil community.\n\nUnlike the war in New Guinea, however, the war in northern Australia was fought almost entirely in the air and the only ground troops involved were the gunners who manned the anti-aircraft weapons. Both sides recorded heavy losses of aircraft and aircrew, and in the final analysis it was the inability to replace these mounting losses which forced Japan to abandon its offensive campaign there altogether.\n\nVery little has been written about the north Australian air war and what has been published to date has generally tended to reflect the Allied view of events. This situation began changing after the mid 1980s with popular and academic research drawing increasingly on unpublished, primary sources in both Japan, Australia and the United States.<ref>See W. M. Prime, 'Fighter Leader', ''Aviation Historical Society of Australia Journal'', vol. 19, no. 2, April\u2013June 1978, p. 27; R. K. Piper, 'Epitaph to a Darwin Raider', ''Journal of the Aircraft Owners' and Pilots' Association'', vol. 35, no. 12, December 1982, pp. 24\u20138; S. Gadja, 'Air-Raid on Broome', ''After The Battle'', no. 28, 1980, pp. 44\u20138.</ref>\n\nJapanese aircraft losses during this campaign have never been examined in detail, despite the fact that they had direct bearing on the final outcome of the campaign. By examining these losses more closely, we may not only increase our understanding of the air war, but also gain a more balanced insight into this often overlooked aspect of Australia's military history.\n\nJapanese air operations against northern Australia fall into three distinct categories: anti-shipping, reconnaissance, and bombing (which includes fighter escort operations). The first of these categories, and the first offensive operations of the northern campaign, were anti-shipping strikes directed primarily against Allied ships trying to resupply the beleaguered ground forces in Timor and Java. These operations were scaled down after 19 February 1942 but resumed again in the [[Arafura Sea]] and Torres Strait regions during early 1943. Anti-shipping operations were usually conducted by naval flying boats such as the [[Kawanishi H6K|Kawanishi H6K (Mavis)]] and [[Kawanishi H8K|H8K (Emily)]] and float-planes such as the [[Mitsubishi F1M|Mitsubishi F1M (Pete)]] or [[Aichi E13A|Aichi E13A (Jake)]].\n\n====February\u2013April 1942====\nAs mentioned earlier, the first aircraft destroyed during the north Australian campaign was a Kawanishi Mavis which was shot down 190&nbsp;kilometres west of Darwin after attacking the ''Houston'' convoy. Japanese anti-shipping operations had actually commenced on 8 February 1942 \u2013 almost two weeks before the first raid on Darwin \u2013 when the [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] [[HMAS Deloraine|HMAS ''Deloraine'']] was attacked by a dive-bomber just 112&nbsp;kilometres west of [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]]. One week after this incident, the Japanese 21st Air Flotilla sent out five of its Mavises to locate any Allied convoys attempting to leave Darwin. Four of the flying boats took off from [[Seram|Ceram]] at 2.00&nbsp;a.m. but the fifth aircraft, piloted by Sub-Lieutenant Mirau, was delayed with engine trouble and did not take off until 4.00&nbsp;a.m. Mirau's aircraft was alone when, at about 10.30&nbsp;a.m., it sighted the ''Houston'' convoy steaming towards Timor. Mirau reported this by radio and was told to continue shadowing the convoy, which he did for a further three hours. Before heading back to Ceram he made an unsuccessful bombing attack on the convoy from 4,000&nbsp;metres, using 60 kilogram bombs. The crew of the flying boat were just settling down to lunch when, as described earlier, they were attacked by an American Kittyhawk.\n\n[http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/trans/495D77D384C7C87ACA256F6C0016E87E?openDocument Mr M. Takahara] (who, after the war, became an executive director of one of Japan's largest stockbroking firms) was the flying boat's observer at the time, and one of only two crewmen to escape the encounter unscathed. His recollections of the incident, which were published recently in Japan, provide a rare personal insight into the nature of the Japanese air war over northern Australia. The following extract from Takahara's third-person narrative account describes what happened after the Kittyhawk was sighted:\n\n<blockquote>The fighter then came at them from the rear. As it approached, Takahara blazed away at it with the cannon. At the same time shots from the fighter tore through the body of the flying-boat. When the fighter was right upon them they saw that white smoke was issuing from its tail. As the fighter dived towards the sea Takahara fired a whole magazine (50 rounds)\ninto it. They saw the fighter hit the water ... Takahara discovered that his wireless operator had been hit and ... the flying-boat, too, with flames coming out of the door forward of the tanks ... Takahara felt the shock as they hit, opened the door and then lost consciousness. He came to in the water.<ref>S. Kikoku Takahara, 'Unbelievable happenings of people who died in the war', ''Eimusu'', 1983.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTakahara and the other five crewmen who survived the crash were able to draw some comfort from the knowledge that the Japanese Army Air Force did eventually capitalize on their success in locating the Allied convoy. The next morning they saw twenty-seven Japanese bombers flying south to attack the convoy. The flying boat crew were subsequently captured on Melville Island and eventually interned at [[Cowra breakout|Cowra]], where they took part in the famous break-out in August 1944.\n\nAnti-shipping operations were resumed on 18 February when the Army supply ship, {{MV|Don Isidro}},{{sfn|Masterson|1949|p=320}}<ref group=Note>Both ''Don Isidro'' and ''Florence D.'' were Philippine registered ships acquired in February 1942 as a part of the U.S. Army's \"Permanent Fleet\" in the South West Pacific Area.

She escaped serious damage and continued to steam in a westerly direction until early the next morning when she was attacked by bombers returning from the first Darwin raid. This time the ''Don Isidro'' caught fire and drifted ashore at Bathurst Island.

Soon afterwards, however, the ship was also attacked and sunk by twenty-seven dive-bombers from the [[1st Air Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy|1st Air Fleet]]. This was in effect the last anti-shipping strike of 1942. Japanese tactics had changed altogether by January 1943 when they resumed anti-shipping operations in the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait. The vital supply route to Darwin was constantly patrolled by small float-plane formations equipped with either Petes, Jakes or Nakajima B5Ns [[Nakajima B5N|(Kates)]]. A tactic commonly employed by Japanese pilots was to switch off the engine and dive out of the sun, which meant that the aircraft was neither heard nor seen until it had dropped its bomb. The supply ship [[HMAS Patricia Cam|HMAS ''Patricia Cam'']] was sunk in this fashion near Wessel Island on 22 January 1943. The store ship [http://www.flotilla-australia.com/images/macumba.jpg Macumba] was also sunk by float-planes at Millingimbi on 10 May, although on this occasion a [[Spitfire]] from No. 457 Squadron managed to shoot down one of the float-planes.<ref group=Note>For security reasons, the Australian military command instructed that the name [[Capstan (cigarette)|'Capstan']] (a popular cigarette brand at that time) be used to disguise the Spitfire's arrival in the Australian theatre of operations.</ref>\n\nThese anti-shipping operations did not cause any lasting disruption to the Allied coastal supply route and the Japanese flying boat bases at Taberfane and Dobo in the [[Aru Islands]] were constantly attacked throughout 1943 by [[No. 31 Squadron RAAF]] [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighters]]. Radar-equipped [[Bristol Beaufort|Beauforts]] from [[No. 7 Squadron RAAF]] had also begun to take their toll and by early 1944 the Japanese anti-shipping campaign had been abandoned altogether. By this stage of the war the Japanese navy had lost seven float-planes over northern Australia as a direct result of aerial combat. The majority of these losses were attributed to large twin-engined bombers, such as the Beaufort or [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]], which do not generally take the offensive in aerial combat.\n\nReconnaissance operations were of secondary significance in terms of Japanese aircraft casualties. These operations were conducted primarily by Army Air Force Mitsubishi Ki46s ([[Mitsubishi Ki-46|Dinahs]]). Kawasaki Ki-48s ([[Kawasaki Ki-48|Lilys]]), Mitsubishi Ki-21 ([[Mitsubishi Ki-21|Sallys]]), C5Ms ([[Mitsubishi C5M|Babs]]) and Zeros were also used to a lesser degree, and a naval reconnaissance aircraft was the first to appear over Darwin on [http://www.ozatwar.com/japrecce/recce11.htm 10 February 1942]. Reconnaissance flights were conducted throughout the entire campaign and the last Japanese aircraft to fly over Australia during the second world war was a Mitsubishi Ki21 (Sally), piloted by Lieutenant Kiyoshi Iizuka.<ref>S. Gadja, 'Dinah Recovery in Western Australia', ''After  The Battle'', no. 39, 1983, pp. 41\u20134.</ref>\nReconnaissance operations were far more numerous than bombing operations, and yet only ten Japanese reconnaissance aircraft were ever destroyed by Allied fighters. The appearance of a reconnaissance aircraft usually indicated to those below that an attack by level bombers was imminent. Reconnaissance flights were generally made at altitudes in excess of 6000&nbsp;metres although Broome and Millingimbi, which had only light anti-aircraft defences, were both reconnoitred from below 3000&nbsp;metres. Sergeant Akira Hayashi was flying a Bab when he first  [[Air raid on Broome, 3 March 1942|reconnoitred Broome on 3 March 1942]]. The Bab was an antiquated design, even by 1942 standards, and this was probably the only occasion when one was ever used over Australia.\n\nThe nine Dinahs shot down over Australia are all thought to have belonged to the 70th Independent Squadron of the 7th Air Division, based at [[Koepang]] in Timor. The Dinah was extremely fast for its size and could reach speeds in excess of 600&nbsp;kilometres per hour. Radar plots showed that the Dinahs would cross the coast at extreme altitude and enter a shallow dive during the return flight, gradually gaining speed until they were well clear of the fighter and anti-aircraft defences. Japanese reconnaissance losses were quite acceptable given the frequency with which these operations were conducted. The 70th Squadron lost [http://www.ozatwar.com/ozcrashes/nt171.htm eight] Dinahs altogether, four of them being lost in a single day ([http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NAAMedia/ShowImage.asp?B=199104&S=12&T=P 17 August 1943]). Wing Commander C. R. Caldwell, Australia's leading [[Flying ace|ace]], accounted for one of these aircraft, and this happened also to be his last confirmed victory:\n\n<blockquote>I opened fire with all guns, my starboard cannon stopping almost immediately ... strikes were observed on the port side of the enemy aircraft fuselage, the starboard engine and tail unit. The starboard engine and fuselage immediately caught fire and some pieces of flying debris hit my own plane ... I flew behind it for several miles; it was now burning at three points and trailing white smoke ... The enemy aircraft appeared to make an attempt to level out momentarily and hit the water at a point 20&nbsp;miles [32 kilometres] due west of [[Cape Fourcroy]]. I photographed the splash with my camera gun and flew at zero feet around the debris observing three bodies in the water, two of which had partially opened parachutes attached ... One body was that of a large man in a black flying suit and helmet; he was lying spreadeagled on top of the water, face upward and I gained the impression that he was still alive.<ref>Australian Archives (AA):[http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NAAMedia/ShowImage.asp?B=199104&S=14&T=P CRS A1196, I/505/505, Spitfires Reccos, 17 August].  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wQnN2Ozi?url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NAAMedia/ShowImage.asp?B=199104&S=14&T=P |date=12 February 2011 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe losses sustained through anti-shipping and reconnaissance operations were comparatively slight, however, when it is considered that nearly one hundred and sixty Japanese aircraft were destroyed over Australia during the mainland bombing offensive. These operations were without doubt the most significant aspect of the entire campaign and have also been the subject of the most discussion. The bomber offensive not only accounted for the majority of Japanese aircraft shot down over Australia but also had the greatest strategic implications for the Allied war effort. It was because of the Japanese bomber offensive that the United States [[Fifth Air Force]] was forced to divert both fighter and heavy bomber aircraft to the [[Northern Territory]] at a time when it was critically short of both. The Allied Commander at that time, General MacArthur, also directed his air force commander, [[George C. Kenney|General Kenney]], to prepare for the rapid transfer of squadrons to airfields around Torres Strait and in the Northern Territory should the Australian mainland come under threat of invasion. To augment these plans the RAAF Directorate of Works was ordered to proceed as quickly as possible with the development of a network of airbases from [[Truscott Airfield]] in the west to [http://www.ozatwar.com/airfields/higginsfield.htm Jacky Jacky (Higgins Field)] in the north of Queensland. The RAAF became so heavily committed to patrolling the Australian coastline that by April 1943 it had reached the stage where it had more operational squadrons on duty in Australia than in the northern frontline theatres of New Guinea.\n\nThe operations discussed in this category were directed exclusively against land-based targets such as Townsville, Horn Island, [[Fenton Airfield|Fenton]]Fenton and Millingimbi. The Japanese bomber offensive commenced on 19 February 1942 and ended on 12 November 1943 with the last raids against Darwin and Fenton. The Naval Air Force supplied most aircraft for the bomber offensive although it is now known that the Army Air Force participated in at least two raids (19 February 1942 and 20 June 1943).\n\nBetty bombers from the [[25th Air Flotilla#cite note-4|Kanoya]] and 753rd Air Corps were used most often in these operations although Kates, Sallys, Lilys, Mitsubishi G3Ms ([[Mitsubishi G3M|Nells]]), Aichi D3As ([[Aichi D3A|Vals]]) and Nakajima Ki49s ([[Nakajima Ki-49|Helens]]) were all used to a lesser extent. The raids on Townsville and [http://www.skp.com.au/memorials2/pages/40238.htm Mossman] in July 1943 were another exception to this general rule as these were carried out by Emily flying boats from the 14th (Yokosuka) Air Group, operating at extreme range from Rabaul, New Britain.\n\nLand-based bombers participating in daylight raids were invariably accompanied by Mitsubishi Zero fighters, described variously as Haps, Hamps or Zekes. The cost of protecting the bombers was high and there were almost as many fighters destroyed as there were bombers. The Zeros participating in the first Darwin raid were all attached to the [[1st Air Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Air Fleet]]. However, the fleet had to withdraw from the area after 19 February, at which stage the [http://home.brisnet.org.au/~dunn/jnaf/jnaf.htm 3rd, 4th, and 202nd Air Corps] had to share responsibility for escorting the bombers. The first raids against Darwin, Broome and Townsville have all been described elsewhere in great detail and so will not be dealt with again in this article. 11 The intention of the following discussion is to provide a general analysis of the bomber offensive against Darwin after February 1942.\n\nDarwin was bombed on sixty-four separate occasions, each of which can be classified according to one of five distinct bombing patterns which alternated between daylight and night attacks. For months at a time the Japanese air forces would adhere to the same attack procedure, giving the Allies numerous opportunities for predicting when and where the next attack was likely to occur. The Japanese became so predictable in this regard that one diarist, writing after the raid on 31 March 1942 made the following observation: <blockquote>This is getting monotonous \u2013 the same. Slight variation this time, however, because they also came over at 10&nbsp;p.m..</blockquote>\n\nThese comments were made during the first phase of operations when the raiding force usually consisted of seven bombers, escorted by at least an equal number of fighters. The last of these raids, led by Lieutenant Fujimara, took place on 5 April 1942.\n\n====April\u2013December 1942====\nThe pattern of attack changed dramatically on 25 April that year when the 753rd Air Corps, led by Lieutenant Commander Matsumi, arrived over Darwin with a force of twenty-four bombers escorted by fifteen fighters. This later proved to be one of the most costly raids of the war with thirteen aircraft failing to return. The 23rd Air Flotilla could ill afford to sustain such high losses and by mid-June it was forced to abandon the practice of mounting large-scale daylight raids.\n\nThe Japanese aircraft strength on Timor, [[Bali]], and Ambon was now reported to be fifty-seven fighters, sixty-nine bombers and four observation aircraft, with a heavier concentration of aircraft at [[Kendari]]. Until then the Japanese had operated very consistently with most flights arriving over the target during the early afternoon. However, when operations resumed during the last week of July after a six-week lapse, the bombers arrived over the target under cover of darkness. Most formations were dramatically reduced in size and on six consecutive nights, beginning on 25 July, the city was bombed by small shotai (three-plane) formations. The attacks were all made from altitudes in excess of 6,600&nbsp;metres (21,654&nbsp;feet) and the damage was minimal.\n\nWhile these nocturnal forays may have caused little in the way of material damage, they did have a demoralizing effect on Darwin's population. As one Department of Civil Aviation official noted at the time:{{citequote|date=August 2013}}<blockquote> We waited for the fifth raid of 27 bombers in succession with a sick feeling in the pit of the stomach. We could not keep our eyes off the burning tanks. The town was deserted by everybody except a few suckers like ourselves whose work kept them there. The raid did not eventuate. I think it was the worst day in my life I have spent to date, just waiting for something to eventuate, which did not.</blockquote>\n\nThe Japanese subsequently used this tactic to great advantage, repeatedly sending over small unescorted formations at night. Elsewhere in the Pacific these lone intruders would remain overhead for hours on end, periodically dropping a bomb to make sure no one got to sleep.\n\nThe night bombing pattern was maintained, almost without variation, for the next six months. On 2 March 1943 there was a switch back to daylight operations when Lieutenant Commander Takahide Aioi's force of sixteen Zeros (202nd [[K\u014dk\u016btai]]) escorted nine Betty bombers (753rd K\u014dk\u016btai) on a raid against the satellite airfield at [[Coomalie Creek Airfield|Coomalie]].<ref>This was the first time that Spitfires were used in combat, in the North Western Area.

These monthly attacks continued through to 13 August when the procedure underwent one final change. The army's 7th Air Division had by this stage withdrawn from Ambon to [[Wewak]], leaving the 23rd Air Flotilla to carry on the campaign. The bombers continued to come over at night until 12 November 1943 when Darwin was attacked for the very last time. While the night bombers were inaccurate, they ran little risk of interception by fighters. Only twice during the entire bombing campaign did Allied fighters succeed in destroying Japanese bombers at night.

One 36-aircraft fighter squadron of the 23rd Air Flotilla with 12 reserves was sent to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in December, and a 36-aircraft bomber squadron with 12 reserves was sent to [[Kwajalein]] in the Central Pacific to await the expected advance of the American fleet.\n\nThe defence of northern Australia was an international effort involving elements of the [[RAAF]], the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and the [[Netherlands East Indies Air Force]] (NEIAF). The RAAF, RAF and NEIAF were, however, unable to make any significant contribution to the north Australian war effort until late 1942. The RAAF had a number of [[Wirraway]] trainers and [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]] medium bombers based in the region during early 1942 but these were unsuited to the type of combat dictated by the Japanese.[[File:Cresswll Betty.jpg|thumb|right|A group of RAAF personnel at the site of the wreckage of a Japanese 'Betty' bomber aircraft shot down by Squadron Leader R C Cresswell during a night raid on Darwin. The bodies of nine Japanese were later found near the wrecked bomber.(Australian War Memorial ID number 013716 [http://cas.awm.gov.au/screen_img/013716])]]\n\nThe northern air war was essentially a fighter conflict with Kittyhawks and Spitfires pitted against Zeros and well-armed Betty bombers. The Kittyhawks of the United States [http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/49fg.htm 49th Fighter Group] bore the brunt of the early operations and eventually accounted for almost half the Japanese aircraft shot down over Australia. It was the 49th Group which also developed the diving-pass system of attack that was to become standard procedure for all Allied fighters in the North-Western Area. The Japanese would often arrive at altitudes in excess of 6600&nbsp;metres (21,654&nbsp;feet) and the Allies' greatest defence, in these circumstances, was the early warning radar network which could detect incoming formations at distances of up to 240&nbsp;kilometres (130 nautical miles). The Allied fighters were generally less manoeuvreable than the Zero, and still had to climb rapidly to be able to attack the Japanese from above.\n\nThe rapid climb tactic that was used throughout the war imposed severe limitations on the fighters' endurance and Allied aircraft were often forced to cut short their engagements. Ninety-two per cent of all Japanese aircraft shot down over northern Australia were in fact shot down by Kittyhawks and Spitfires. The remaining thirteen aircraft were all destroyed by either anti-aircraft fire, Beauforts, Hudsons or Beaufighters.\n\nMost Japanese losses were sustained during daylight attacks against targets in the Northern Territory, Port Darwin in particular. However, more than half these attacks occurred at night when the Allied fighters, lacking air-to-air radar, were generally unable to intercept their attackers.\n\nThe Americans were also at a distinct disadvantage when the Japanese launched their first attack on Darwin. Since 15 February 1942 the newly activated [[33rd Pursuit Squadron]] had been flying patrol over the waters north-west of Darwin. On 19 February, however, its planes had been scheduled for an attempt to get through to Timor. In fact ten of the squadron's P-40s had taken off for Koepang at approximately 9.00&nbsp;a.m. but had to return half an hour later because of an unfavourable weather report. It was therefore more the result of good luck, rather than good management, that Darwin was not left completely undefended during the first Japanese air attack. In the event the American Kittyhawks could offer little more than token resistance to the 1st Air Fleet which arrived over Darwin undetected, and in overwhelming numbers. The Japanese pilots were also experienced combat veterans whereas the majority of the American pilots were pitifully inexperienced, some having as little as twelve hours' experience in combat aircraft.\n\nNine Kittyhawks were destroyed in quick succession and only Lieutenant Robert Oestreicher managed to bring his bullet-punctured [http://www.google.com.au/search?q=Lieutenant+Robert+Oestreicher&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a P-40 (\"Miss Nadine\" #43)] to a normal landing. Oestreicher was the only American pilot to shoot down a Japanese aircraft during this historic action. The following extract from his combat report describes the events of that morning:\n<blockquote>After flying about among the clouds for about half an hour I spotted two [[Nakajima B5N|series 97 dive bombers]] with a fixed landing gear on a course heading for [[Batchelor Airfield|Batchelor]] Field. Intercepting them at about 1500&nbsp;feet [approximately 5OO metres] I fired and saw one definitely burst into flames and go down. The other was smoking slightly as he headed for the clouds. I lost him in the clouds.</blockquote>\n\nLate that same afternoon the report came through that a coast artillery battery had located both planes within a mile [1.6 kilometres] of each other. These are the first confirmed aerial victories on Australian soil.\n\nThe Japanese 1st Air Fleet is conservatively estimated to have lost five aircraft during the first Darwin raid. Australian anti-aircraft gunners accounted for one Zero and one bomber while a second Zero was later found crash-landed on Melville Island. This last aircraft, which was still relatively intact, gave Allied intelligence officers their first opportunity to try to establish the basis of the Zero's phenomenal performance. A detailed examination of the aircraft established such crucial factors as maximum range and firepower and also highlighted a number of significant weaknesses such as the lack of fuel tank protection, pilot armour, and armoured glass. Equally significant was the discovery that the Japanese were using Swedish-designed cannons and American-designed direction-finding compasses, propellers and machine-guns. The Zero had already begun to look vulnerable.\n\nDiscoveries like these were the concern of the [http://www.ozatwar.com/usaaf/atiu.htm Technical Air Intelligence Unit] (TAIU) which had established a sub-unit in the North-Western Area during October 1942. The TAIU was an American unit, based in [[Brisbane]], which was responsible for evaluating and monitoring the development of Japanese aircraft. The unit's north Australian representative was an Australian, Pilot Officer Crook, who was constantly competing with souvenir hunters for access to Japanese aircraft wreckage. Crook's main task. was to examine enemy aircraft wreckage and collect any data plates that had escaped the attention of the souvenir hunters, so as to monitor changes in armament, crew capacity, camouflage, airframe and engine design. By comparing serial numbers and production dates it was possible also to estimate production rates for individual aircraft types.\n\nIntelligence data turned up in the most unlikely circumstances, as for example in September 1942 when a 'party of [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 squadron]] personnel while on leave discovered two attache cases, with Jap markings, found to contain electrically heated flying suits and other personal gear'. It was the examination of crash-sites, however, which often yielded the most information. The unit's greatest coup was the salvage of Betty T359, which was the first Japanese aircraft shot down over Australia at night during air-to-air combat. The aircraft had crashed on Koolpinyah Station, where it was later discovered substantially intact. An examination of the wreckage revealed that the Betty carried a crew of nine rather than seven, as was previously thought.\n\nOn 27 February Lieutenant Oestreicher received telegraphic orders to fly south and report to the 49th Fighter Group at Bankstown. General MacArthur had agreed that the 49th Fighter Group, commanded by Colonel Paul Wurtsmith, should be diverted to the Northern Territory. However, Darwin was left undefended for almost four weeks before the first elements of the group arrived on 14 March. In the meantime the Japanese had broadened the scope of their attacks to include Broome, Wyndham and Horn Island. The Allies had no fighter defences at Broome or Wyndham when Japanese fighters attacked on 3 March 1942. Twenty-four Allied aircraft were destroyed in the space of fifteen minutes whereas only one Zero, piloted by Chief Air Sergeant Osamu Kudo, was brought down by anti-aircraft\ngunners.\n\nThe Japanese met with stiff opposition, however, when they first attacked Horn Island on 14 March. Eight Nell bombers and nine Zeros arrived over the target at 1.00&nbsp;p.m. and were intercepted by nine P-40s of the 7th Fighter Squadron, which was then staging through on its way to Darwin. This was the first time that the Japanese Air Force had encountered any significant fighter opposition over mainland Australia and the result, so far as the Japanese were concerned, was less than encouraging. The Americans shot down four Zeros and one bomber while one American aircraft was destroyed and one damaged. Two of the Zeros were shot down by Second Lieutenant House, Jr.  Although Horn Island was attacked again on numerous occasions, the Japanese always managed to avoid interception by\nAllied fighters.\n\nKittyhawks of the 49th Fighter Group had arrived in Darwin by mid-March and on 22 March they carried out their first interception. Nine bombers, three Zeros and one reconnaissance aircraft had penetrated 300&nbsp;kilometres inland to Katherine, dropping one stick of bombs from high altitude. An Aborigine was killed, another wounded, and some damage was done to the aerodrome. The 9th Fighter Squadron only managed to destroy one Nakajima reconnaissance plane, but in doing so they helped pioneer the use of early warning radar in the south-west Pacific. Early warning radar was without doubt the single most important factor to influence the outcome of the north Australian air war. Without adequate warning the Allied fighters could offer little defence against the enemy formations which invariably arrived over the mainland at extreme altitude.\nThe 22 March raid was in fact the first successful radar-controlled intercept of the war. By detecting the incoming formation at a range of approximately 130&nbsp;kilometres the CSIR's experimental radar station at Dripstone Caves, near Darwin, had effectively proved the usefulness of the concept of radar-controlled interception to a largely pessimistic military and civilian community.\n\nRadar was no longer a new-fangled invention to be regarded with suspicion, but a valuable weapon. Faith in its efficacy grew rapidly, sometimes to limits\nbeyond its deserving. It was well known to the radiophysicists that the air warning set did not, because of the interference of radio waves reflected from the earth, cover regions near the ground. Had the Japanese known this, they could, by flying at low level, have come quite close to the target before\ntheir presence was detected. Fortunately for Britain, even the German pilots did not know of this trick early in the war. The German pilots did learn it later, and long after the Darwin raids passed the trick on to the Japanese just as their air strength was nearly exhausted. The Americans failed to intercept during the next five raids and on 2 April the Shell oil refineries in Harvey Street were struck by bomb splinters, causing 136 000 litres of aviation spirit to be lost. Two days later, however, the Kittyhawks were ready and waiting when seven bombers and six fighters attacked the civil airfield at Darwin. The 9th Fighter Squadron destroyed five bombers and two Zeros, losing only one of its own aircraft and damaging two. This engagement, needless to say, did much to restore confidence within the beleaguered community. Second Lieutenants John Landers and Andrew Reynolds both managed to destroy two aircraft each during this encounter.\n\nThe anti-aircraft defences also put in an outstanding effort on this occasion and the Australian {{convert|3.7|in|mm|adj=on}} guns at Fanny Bay brought down two enemy bombers. One eyewitness described the view from the ground in the following dramatic terms:{{citequote|date=August 2013}}\n:Day of days. Our first victory. Seven bombers appeared supported by several fighters. As the bombers came over the point the very first two rounds from the A.A. burst just behind the formation and got five bombers of the seven. One blew up immediately. Another, badly ablaze, screamed down towards the ground. The others, with amazing discipline tried to keep formation. I saw a Jap jump out of one of the blazing machines \u2013 just a small black dot. His parachute opened but a burning piece of plane fell on it. The Jap fell rapidly and landed just on the other side of the aerodrome.\n\nNo less dramatic were the independent reports received the following day of 'hostile fighters flying at about 4/500' with American markings'. The gunners at the oval 'reported distinct Zero features with USA markings'.{{citequote|date=August 2013}} The fact that these reports were made independently, and at relatively close range, gives them credibility.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe anti-aircraft guns played an important role throughout the campaign by ensuring that the bombers remained at an altitude from which accurate bombing became very difficult. The Australian gunners were very effective in this regard even though they only managed to shoot down a total of eight enemy aircraft.\nDarwin had, up until 4 April, been defended by just one squadron of American fighters. The city began to feel less defenceless when reinforcements arrived two days later in the form of the 7th Fighter Squadron. The 8th Fighter Squadron had also arrived by 15 April, giving the 49th Fighter Group its full complement of sixty aircraft. Never again were the Allies to be outnumbered as they had been at the start of the war.\n\nThe group was able to repeat its earlier successes when, on 25 April, it destroyed thirteen enemy aircraft in an enemy formation comprising twenty-four bombers and fifteen fighters. Three of the bombers were shot down by Second Lieutenant James Morehead of the 8th Fighter Squadron. First Lieutenant George Kiser managed to duplicate this feat two days later when he too destroyed two bombers and one Zero. This was to be the last raid for some time as the 23rd Air Flotilla then refrained from attacking Australia for almost six weeks. The 49th Fighter Group had thus far compiled a very creditable record. Prior to May it had lost eight of its P-40s and three pilots while destroying a total of thirty-eight Japanese planes and an estimated 135 crewmen. The 49th's combat record was in fact the only bright spot in the Allied war effort which was then still largely defensive.\n\nThe 49th Fighter Group had been in combat for more than two months when the British prime minister announced on 28 May that he was sending three Spitfire squadrons to Australia. The squadrons chosen were No. 54 Squadron (RAF) and two Empire Air Training Scheme squadrons, Nos 452 and 457, both of which had been formed in Britain in June 1941. 'The arrangement was that each squadron would receive sixteen aircraft as initial equipment and replacements at the rate of five aircraft per squadron per month.' 23 Unfortunately the first consignment of forty-two Spitfires was diverted to the Middle East following the fall of Tobruk on 21 June. Almost four months were to pass before the second consignment of seventy-one Spitfires arrived in Australia.\n\nThe large-scale daylight raids recommenced on 13 June and continued for four successive days. It was during the last of these raids, on 16 June, that the 49th Fighter Group suffered its first major set-back, losing five of its Kittyhawks while destroying only two enemy aircraft. The Americans still had some cause for celebration as Second Lieutenant Reynolds had managed to shoot down his fifth Japanese aircraft during operations in northern Australia. Reynolds thus became the first ace of the Australian campaign. Five other Allied pilots were to earn this distinction by the time the campaign ended in July 1944. It is not known{{to whom|date=August 2013}} if any Japanese pilots ever emerged as aces from this theatre of operations.\n\nThe bombers arrived under cover of darkness during July, leaving the 49th Fighter Group powerless to do anything more than watch. The scope of the Japanese attacks was broadened towards the end of the month to include Port Hedland in Western Australia and Townsville in north Queensland. Port Hedland was of little strategic significance, but Townsville was the largest aircraft depot in northern Australia. It was also an important staging point for aircraft en route to New Guinea and the Central Pacific Area. This interlude brought consciousness of the air war more sharply into focus for the Australian people. For three successive nights from 25 July, Townsville was bombed by Emily flying boats of the 14th (Yokosuka) Air Group. Six American Airacobras of the 8th Fighter Group were alerted and airborne during the second alert, while the intruder was still 80&nbsp;kilometres distant. The Emily managed to drop its bombs and avoid being intercepted despite these elaborate preparations. The Yokosuka Air Group  returned again the following night, as if spurred on by its earlier success. This time, however, Emily number W37 was intercepted by two Airacobras from the 36th Fighter Squadron, which scored a number of hits on the huge flying boat. It escaped apparently without serious damage and an Allied wireless operator subsequently intercepted a transmission indicating that W37 had arrived back at Rabaul.\n\nThat the radar station at Kissing Point in Townsville managed to detect the enemy flying boats at extreme range. The RAAF's need for an early warning radar network had become so critical that by early 1942 the Australian Radiophysics Laboratory was asked to modify a number of SCR268 anti-aircraft gunnery sets which had arrived in Australia after the Americans were forced to evacuate the Philippines. The first set to be modified in this manner was erected at Kissing Point where, in July 1942, it gave an outstanding one-hour-fifty-minute warning of an approaching enemy aircraft.\n\nSuccesses like these were not always the order of the day: at Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia on 24 September 1943 a flock of birds sitting atop the antenna triggered an air raid alert.\n\nThe 23rd Air Flotilla had in the meantime resumed its daylight bombing campaign against Port Darwin. The 49th Fighter Group was equipped at the time with early model Kittyhawk P-40Es which were outclassed by the nimble Zero fighters. The Americans were quick to realize that their best defence was to dive through the enemy formation, safe in the knowledge that the Zero would be unable to follow at the same speed. On 30 July the 49th had an opportunity to demonstrate that it could achieve creditable results, providing its Kittyhawks had the height advantage. On this particular occasion, Darwin's twenty-sixth air raid, the Americans had been given ample warning of the incoming attack and were thus able to strike the enemy from above, destroying six bombers and three fighters and losing only one P-40. Second Lieutenant John Landers emerged from this combat as the group's second ace after having already destroyed three enemy aircraft during an earlier engagement.\n\nOn the following day Port Moresby was raided for the seventy-seventh time. The formations which attacked Darwin, however, were in general much larger than those which attacked Port Moresby. As late as September 1943 the 23rd Air Flotilla could still assemble a force of thirty-seven aircraft, whereas in New Guinea the Japanese attacking formations became smaller and smaller as the war progressed.\n\nThe first Australian reinforcements arrived during August 1942 when twenty-four Kittyhawks from No. 77 Squadron commenced operations at Livingstone. The squadron's arrival coincided with a period of reduced enemy activity and although it remained in the region until early 1943, it later left for Milne Bay without ever meeting the Japanese on equal terms. The squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander Cresswell, did however achieve one notable success when he shot down a Betty bomber of the Takao Air Group on the night of 23 November 1942. This was the first successful night interception of the north Australian war.\n\nNo. 77 Squadron arrived in the Northern Territory just as the veteran American 49th Fighter Group was preparing to leave after five months of continuous combat. The group fought its final battle on 23 August when a very large enemy force of twenty-seven bombers and twenty-seven fighters attempted to bomb the Hudsons based at Hughes Field. Twenty-four Kittyhawks from the 7th and 8th Fighter Squadrons managed to intercept the formation, shooting down fifteen Japanese aircraft for the loss of just one P-40. This later proved to be the most successful combat of the entire campaign. It also gave the group its third ace, First Lieutenant James Morehead, who shot down two Zeros over Cape Fourcroy on Melville Island. The group left north Australia with a final tally of seventy-nine Japanese aircraft which had cost them twenty-one Kittyhawks (and two damaged).\n\nThe Americans' departure was timed to coincide with the arrival of replacement fighters from Britain. These had arrived in Sydney during October which was fortunate for the Allies, as this represented a period of reduced activity for the 23rd Air Flotilla. No. 76 Squadron also arrived at Strauss during October but, as was the case with No. 77 Squadron, they too departed soon afterwards without having seen much combat.\n\nNo. 31 Squadron's arrival at Coomalie the same month represented a turning point in the war. The Allied air forces had, up until then, been fighting a defensive campaign over their own bases. The introduction of Beaufighters gave the Allies a potent weapon with which to attack the enemy in his own territory. Unlike the Mitchells and Hudsons which had been conducting offensive operations almost from the start of the war, the Beaufighters of No. 31 Squadron were designed exclusively as ground attack aircraft and did much to increase the enemy's rate of attrition.\n\n====January\u2013May 1943====\nThe Capstans which had arrived from Britain the previous month had, by late 1942, finished training at Richmond in New South Wales and been regrouped under the banner of No. 1 Fighter Wing (RAAF). The wing was commanded by Group Captain Walters and the wing leader was Wing Commander Caldwell who was at that time the RAAF's leading ace. The wing transferred to the Northern Territory in January 1943 with No. 54 Squadron based at Darwin, No. 452 at Strauss, and No. 457 at Livingstone. No. 18 Squadron (NEIAF) also arrived during the same month, emphasizing the shift to the offensive.\n\nThe wing had barely commenced operations when it scored its first victory on 6 February 1943. Flight Lieutenant Foster of No. 54 Squadron was vectored to intercept an incoming Dinah which he shot down over the sea near Cape Van Diemen.\n\nThis initial excitement was followed by almost four weeks of inactivity until 2 March, when nine Kates and sixteen Zeros made a daylight attack on the No. 31 Squadron Beaufighters at Coomalie. Caldwell led No. 54 Squadron in a successful interception and he personally succeeded in shooting down his first Zero, as well as a Kate bomber. The Japanese lost three aircraft altogether and although there were no Capstans shot down, one Beaufighter was destroyed on the ground (A19-31). Five days later No. 457 Squadron recorded its first victory. Four aircraft were scrambled to intercept Japanese aircraft reported to be over Bathurst Island. They were ordered to 4500&nbsp;metres and found a Dinah heading for home over the sea about twenty-five kilometres from Darwin. Flight Lieutenant MacLean and Flight Sergeant McDonald each made two attacks at close range and the enemy plunged into the sea burning fiercely.\n\nThe wing had its first full-scale encounter with the Japanese on 15 March when all three Capstan squadrons intercepted a very large force of twenty-two Bettys escorted by twenty-seven Zeros. Using the European tactic of dogfighting the Capstans managed to shoot down six Bettys and two Zeros, losing four of their own aircraft. However, the bombers did manage to hit six oil tanks, setting two of them on fire. Squadron Leader Goldsmith, who destroyed two aircraft during this engagement, later wrote in his log-book:{{citequote|date=August 2013}}\nSquirted at a Hap while his No. 2 came round behind me. Knocked lumps off wing, was hit in tail wheel and wing root. Followed bombers 80&nbsp;miles [128 kilometres] out to sea, attacked out of sun. Got a Hap on way down, made two attacks on Betty which broke formation. Landed with 3 galls [14 litres] petrol, tail wheel broke off when I touched down.\n\nGoldsmith's reference to having only three gallons of fuel left was a warning which went unheeded. The [http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/49fg.htm 49th Fighter Group] had learnt through experience that there was nothing to be gained by [[dogfight]]ing with a Zero. This type of combat resulted in increased fuel consumption which if left unchecked could lead to fuel starvation. The Kittyhawk pilots had therefore developed the diving-pass technique and avoided close quarter combat whenever this was possible.\n\nThe Spitfires persisted with the dogfighting technique until 2 May when five aircraft had to carry out forced landings through lack of fuel. A further three Spitfires made forced landings because of engine failure and all but two of these eight aircraft were later recovered. At the time, however, it looked as if the wing had lost thirteen aircraft and the fact that all the bombers had reached their target without loss only made the situation look much worse. To add insult to injury, the press obtained the casualty figures, and made much of the fact that this was the first occasion when any communique had reported heavy losses.\n\nThe Advisory War Council had little choice but to order an official inquiry and called for a special report from the Chief of Air Staff. As a result of these investigations the Capstans were fitted with drop-tanks and dogfighting was banned altogether.\n\n====June\u2013November 1943====\nThe Japanese 7th Air Regiment encountered a more disciplined opposition when it next attacked Darwin on 20 June. The wing achieved its best result, shooting down fourteen enemy aircraft while losing just three Capstans. 27\nIt was during this encounter that Wing Commander Caldwell, who was already a European theatre ace, shot down his fifth Japanese aircraft.\n\nThe USAAF 380 Bomb Group's arrival in the Northern Territory had not escaped the enemy's notice and on 30 June they switched their attentions to Fenton where the Liberator B-24s were based. So significant were the long-range Liberator strikes that the Japanese now focused their attacks almost exclusively on Fenton. The American airbase was to remain their primary target for all future bombing attacks, right up until the last Japanese raid on 12 November 1943.\n\nThe Liberators because of their great range and bomb-carrying capacity were making the most effective contribution achieved from North-Western Area. Their geographical position in the Northern Territory enabled them to strike at targets far behind the Japanese front lines which were out of the reach of other Fifth Air Force bomber groups in New Guinea. These activities made a worthwhile contribution to MacArthur's advance along the north New Guinea coast by destroying installations and forcing the enemy to retain defences well to the rear thereby weakening the front. 28\nThe Capstans subsequently shot down two more Dinahs, bringing the wing's total to seventy-six, slightly less than that of the 49th Fighter Group. No. 1 Fighter Wing had, in the course of the war, lost thirty-six Capstans and suffered damage to nine others.\n\nElsewhere, far to the east of Darwin, No. 7 Squadron (RAAF) had also begun to notch up an impressive record. No. 7 Squadron's Beauforts regularly patrolled the western approaches to Horn Island in an effort to protect the vital shipping lanes through the Torres Strait. The Australian-built Beaufort Mk VIIIs were equipped with ASV (air-to-surface vessel) radar and on 18 June, aircraft number A9-296, piloted by Flying Officer Hopton, made the first successful radar interception within the Australian war zone. The crew of A9-296 saw an indication of an enemy plane on its radar screen at about ten kilometres distance. This proved to be a Jake float-plane which was attacked by the Beaufort and crashed into the sea.\n\nNo. 7 Squadron subsequently made two more successful interceptions, one of which must surely rank as the war's most bizarre combat. Flying Officer Legge was flying Beaufort A9-329 on 20 September 1943 when he sighted a 'Jake' 42&nbsp;miles [67 kilometres] west of Cape Valsch, and attacked it. The enemy aircraft force-landed in the water and the pilot dived overboard. An attempt by Legge to bomb the 'Jake' in the water was unsuccessful, but the Beaufort came down to 100' [30 metres], and the navigator straddled the enemy aircraft with a burst from his nose gun, causing the 'Jake' to burst into flames. 29\nThe Allied defence of northern Australia must be judged a success given that the Allied air forces destroyed 174 aircraft during the twenty-nine months after February 1942, losing only sixty-eight Kittyhawks and Capstans themselves. The Japanese personnel losses were much higher than these figures suggest as more than half the aircraft lost by the Japanese were bombers, usually Bettys, which each carried seven crewmen.\n\n===Results===\nThe Japanese Air Force never actually reduced the intensity or frequency of its operations, despite these heavy losses. Darwin was attacked by large enemy formations as late as September 1943 and indeed the Northern Territory was still being bombed well after raids on Port Moresby had stopped. The Japanese Air Force also achieved some measure of success by consistently attacking Australia while being on the defensive in most other theatres.\n\nAlthough the damage caused by these attacks was relatively slight, the cost to the Allies in terms of their delayed offensives and diverted resources was considerable, particularly during 1942. The north Australian air war might therefore be described as a thorn in MacArthur's side in the sense that it was never completely crippling, but always a cause of concern. In the event, the contest for air superiority over northern Australia was finally decided in the skies over Rabaul and the northern Solomons. The Japanese Naval Air Force, having suffered heavy losses in these areas, was forced to redistribute, using aircraft from the 23rd Air  Flotilla. Likewise, the Japanese army's 7th Air Division was also relocated to compensate for losses elsewhere in the Pacific.\n\nThe north Australian air war will always be regarded{{by whom|date=August 2013}} as a significant, rather than a crucial battle. There were no real winners or losers and yet to all Australians, then as now this episode will always be remembered as a turning point in Australian history. Australians had become complacent after 154 years of peaceful settlement, safe in the belief that their isolation would keep them free from foreign aggression. For most people living in Australia in February 1942 the war was still a slightly abstract notion involving foreign people, places and ideals. On 19 February, however, World War II became a reality for all Australians, destroying once and for all the notion that Australia was inviolable.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3px\"\n|+\n\n===Allied and Japanese aircraft losses===\n\n!

The campaign began with the Japanese [[bombing of Darwin]] on 19 February 1942 and continued until the end of the war.\n\nWhile the Japanese attack on Darwin inflicted heavy damage on the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] (RAAF) base there, the Allies quickly recovered. Darwin was reinforced to meet the [[Proposed Japanese invasion of Australia during World War II|perceived threat of invasion]] and additional airfields were built to the south of the town. By October 1942 the RAAF's [[North-Western Area Command (RAAF)|North-Western Area Command]] had been built up to six squadrons, and was conducting daily attacks on Japanese positions in the NEI.<ref name=\"Coates_p270\">{{cite book|last=Coates|title=An Atlas of Australia's Wars|year=2006|pages=270|isbn=0-19-555914-2}}</ref>\n\nThe Allied force continued to expand in 1943 with the arrival of [[United States Army Air Forces]] [[B-24 Liberator]] heavy bomber units, Australian and British [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] squadrons and Australian and Dutch medium bomber squadrons.

The convoy had left [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] without air cover and was forced to return the following day, having failed to reinforce the Allied garrison on [[Timor]]. The Japanese flying boat located the convoy at 10.30&nbsp;a.m. and maintained visual contact for a further three hours. When it was about 190&nbsp;kilometres west of Darwin the H6K made an unsuccessful bombing attack on the vessels before turning for home. Soon afterwards, however, the flying boat was spotted by an American [[Curtiss P-40|Kittyhawk]] fighter, piloted by [http://clarkjanson.com/histories/PERES,%20Jack%20incident%20report.pdf Lieutenant Robert Buel], who then made a diving attack on the Japanese aircraft. After a brief exchange of gunfire both aircraft caught fire and crashed into the sea, thus ending the first aerial combat of the northern Australian air war.<ref group=Note>2nd Lt Robert J Buel's P-40E (#54 White) belonged to the 3rd Pursuit Squadron (Provisional).</ref>\n\nThis was the first of many Japanese aircraft to be shot down over north Australia or within Australian territorial waters during World War II. For nearly two and a half years following this initial engagement, Japanese Army and Naval Air Forces maintained a constant surveillance of northern Australia, ranging from [[Broome, Western Australia|Broome]] on the west coast to [[Horn Island, Queensland|Horn Island]] in north Queensland. For much of this time Australia was also being subjected to regular, full-scale bombing attacks by land-based bombers which were stationed barely a few hours away from the strategic port of Darwin in the Northern Territory.\n\nBy early 1942 the Japanese had assembled a force of nearly 130 aircraft in the islands to the north-west of Darwin. This force, comprising sixty-three [[Mitsubishi G4M|Mitsubishi G4M (Betty) bombers]], forty-eight [[Mitsubishi Zero|Mitsubishi A6M (Zero)]] fighters, and eighteen four-engined flying boats, had been assembled from elements of the [http://www.navweaps.com/index_oob/OOB_WWII_Pacific/OOB_WWII_Combined_Fleet.htm 21st and 23rd Air Flotillas] which had already participated in the [[Philippines Campaign (1941\u20131942)|Philippines campaign]] and the sinking of the [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|British battleships HMS ''Prince of Wales'']] and [[HMS Repulse (1916)|HMS ''Repulse'']].<ref group=Note>The Allied code-names which appear in parentheses will be used hereafter to distinguish between different types of Japanese aircraft.</ref> From bases in [[Java]], Timor, [[Sulawesi|Celebes]], and [[New Guinea]], the Japanese attacked every operational airfield in the northern and north-western parts of Australia, including the strategically important Allied airfields at [[Townsville]] and [[Horn Island, Queensland|Horn Island]] in north Queensland. The Allied supply ships that plied the [[Arafura Sea]] and [[Torres Strait]] were also vulnerable to these attacks.\n\n====Raids on Darwin====\n{{main|Bombing of Darwin}}\nDarwin bore the brunt of these devastating attacks which began on [http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/darwin02.htm 19 February 1942]. The first two Japanese air raids against Darwin, and the events which followed, represent the most humiliating moments in Australia's military history. The Allied command had failed to appreciate the significance of the Japanese buildup to the north-west of Darwin, despite the pattern of recent events at [[Pearl Harbor attack|Pearl Harbor]], [[Fall of Singapore|Singapore]] and [[Battle of Rabaul (1942)|Rabaul]]. The port was without fighter defences and the army garrison consisted of just two brigades. Darwin harbour had become choked with vulnerable naval and merchant vessels, defended by an anti-aircraft battery of only eighteen guns.\n\nThe first Darwin air raid was followed by an outbreak of widespread military and civil disorder which, fuelled by rumours of Japanese invasion, soon led to a state of panic. Since this was also the largest ever attack against the Australian mainland, most historical discussions about the war in northern Australia tended to concentrate on these first surprise attacks against Darwin. By treating these events in isolation, however, 20th-century historians such as [[Douglas Lockwood]] and [http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2914311 Timothy Hall] have unwittingly reinforced the notion that these early raids on Australia \u2013 and Darwin \u2013 were isolated incidents conducted opportunistically and in no way related to, say, the later raids against Broome, [http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/mill02.htm Millingimbi] or Horn Island.<ref>Lockwood. Douglas. ''Australia's Pearl Harbour'', Melbourne, 1966; Hall, Timothy.''Darwin 1942, Australia's Darkest Hour'', Melbourne, 1980.</ref>\n\nThe Japanese air raids against mainland Australia, though very wide-ranging and seemingly unrelated in strategic terms, did in fact have considerable impact on [[Douglas MacArthur|General MacArthur's]] south-west Pacific strategies, particularly during 1942. The threat of Japanese invasion forced the Allies to defend the northern, and to a lesser extent the eastern, approaches to mainland Australia. This was done, initially at least, at the expense of the New Guinea campaign. Although Darwin had been attacked by an aerial force numerically equivalent to that which had paralysed the American Pacific fleet at Pearl Harbor, the main thrust of the Allied war effort was then being directed towards the defence of Port Moresby which, until then, had been subjected to just a few, ineffectual nuisance raids.\n\nMacArthur viewed the threat to northern Australia with such seriousness that he ordered his first operational fighter squadron be sent to Darwin, rather than Port Moresby. As more fighter squadrons became available they were sent immediately to the Northern Territory and it was late April 1942 before Port Moresby's fighter defences equalled those of Darwin. Early warning [http://www.qsl.net/vk2dym/radio/RS31_Radara.htm radar] systems were in very short supply during 1942, yet again Darwin received priority over Port Moresby.\n\n====Japanese offensive in the North-Western Area====\nBy maintaining their offensive stance in the North-Western Area, the Japanese were also presenting a threat to the vulnerable western approaches to New Guinea. This region lay on the flank of MacArthur's main concentrations and had to be adequately protected to ensure the success of his projected offensive. However MacArthur rated the prospect of a Japanese assault on mainland Australia, he could not afford to overlook the unquestionable superiority of Japanese air strength in Timor, Java, and Celebes. By May 1943, the Japanese had developed almost sixty-seven airfields in the arc of islands around Australia. An Allied General Headquarters report of 14 March 1943 had estimated that a total of 334 Japanese aircraft could be deployed to the north-west of Australia.<ref>Odgers, George. ''Australia in the War of 1939\u20131945, Air War  Against Japan 1943\u20131945'', Canberra, 1957, p. 38.</ref> Such was the significance of the threat to the region that eleven squadrons, which included three of MacArthur's highly valued heavy bombardment squadrons, had been committed to the region's defence by August 1943. The buildup of air defences was to continue and by July 1944, when the last Japanese aircraft had been shot down over Australia, there were seventeen squadrons participating in the defence of northern Australia.\n\nWhen viewed in this context, the war in northern Australia amounts to much more than just another Pearl Harbor. The latter was an isolated strike directed primarily against the capital ships of the [[United States Pacific Fleet]]. Offensive operations against northern Australia, on the other hand, continued until late 1943, and were directed against a wide variety of land-based targets as well as merchant shipping. Darwin was probably, after Port Moresby, the most frequently bombed Allied base in the south-west Pacific. For almost two years the Japanese Air Force was able to maintain a bomber offensive which significantly disrupted and delayed the Allied war effort, whilst simultaneously causing considerable anxiety within the Australian civil community.\n\nUnlike the war in New Guinea, however, the war in northern Australia was fought almost entirely in the air and the only ground troops involved were the gunners who manned the anti-aircraft weapons. Both sides recorded heavy losses of aircraft and aircrew, and in the final analysis it was the inability to replace these mounting losses which forced Japan to abandon its offensive campaign there altogether.\n\nVery little has been written about the north Australian air war and what has been published to date has generally tended to reflect the Allied view of events. This situation began changing after the mid 1980s with popular and academic research drawing increasingly on unpublished, primary sources in both Japan, Australia and the United States.<ref>See W. M. Prime, 'Fighter Leader', ''Aviation Historical Society of Australia Journal'', vol. 19, no. 2, April\u2013June 1978, p. 27; R. K. Piper, 'Epitaph to a Darwin Raider', ''Journal of the Aircraft Owners' and Pilots' Association'', vol. 35, no. 12, December 1982, pp. 24\u20138; S. Gadja, 'Air-Raid on Broome', ''After The Battle'', no. 28, 1980, pp. 44\u20138.</ref>\n\nJapanese aircraft losses during this campaign have never been examined in detail, despite the fact that they had direct bearing on the final outcome of the campaign. By examining these losses more closely, we may not only increase our understanding of the air war, but also gain a more balanced insight into this often overlooked aspect of Australia's military history.\n\nJapanese air operations against northern Australia fall into three distinct categories: anti-shipping, reconnaissance, and bombing (which includes fighter escort operations). The first of these categories, and the first offensive operations of the northern campaign, were anti-shipping strikes directed primarily against Allied ships trying to resupply the beleaguered ground forces in Timor and Java. These operations were scaled down after 19 February 1942 but resumed again in the [[Arafura Sea]] and Torres Strait regions during early 1943. Anti-shipping operations were usually conducted by naval flying boats such as the [[Kawanishi H6K|Kawanishi H6K (Mavis)]] and [[Kawanishi H8K|H8K (Emily)]] and float-planes such as the [[Mitsubishi F1M|Mitsubishi F1M (Pete)]] or [[Aichi E13A|Aichi E13A (Jake)]].\n\n====February\u2013April 1942====\nAs mentioned earlier, the first aircraft destroyed during the north Australian campaign was a Kawanishi Mavis which was shot down 190&nbsp;kilometres west of Darwin after attacking the ''Houston'' convoy. Japanese anti-shipping operations had actually commenced on 8 February 1942 \u2013 almost two weeks before the first raid on Darwin \u2013 when the [[Minesweeper (ship)|minesweeper]] [[HMAS Deloraine|HMAS ''Deloraine'']] was attacked by a dive-bomber just 112&nbsp;kilometres west of [[Bathurst Island (Northern Territory)|Bathurst Island]]. One week after this incident, the Japanese 21st Air Flotilla sent out five of its Mavises to locate any Allied convoys attempting to leave Darwin. Four of the flying boats took off from [[Seram|Ceram]] at 2.00&nbsp;a.m. but the fifth aircraft, piloted by Sub-Lieutenant Mirau, was delayed with engine trouble and did not take off until 4.00&nbsp;a.m. Mirau's aircraft was alone when, at about 10.30&nbsp;a.m., it sighted the ''Houston'' convoy steaming towards Timor. Mirau reported this by radio and was told to continue shadowing the convoy, which he did for a further three hours. Before heading back to Ceram he made an unsuccessful bombing attack on the convoy from 4,000&nbsp;metres, using 60 kilogram bombs. The crew of the flying boat were just settling down to lunch when, as described earlier, they were attacked by an American Kittyhawk.\n\n[http://ajrp.awm.gov.au/ajrp/ajrp2.nsf/trans/495D77D384C7C87ACA256F6C0016E87E?openDocument Mr M. Takahara] (who, after the war, became an executive director of one of Japan's largest stockbroking firms) was the flying boat's observer at the time, and one of only two crewmen to escape the encounter unscathed. His recollections of the incident, which were published recently in Japan, provide a rare personal insight into the nature of the Japanese air war over northern Australia. The following extract from Takahara's third-person narrative account describes what happened after the Kittyhawk was sighted:\n\n<blockquote>The fighter then came at them from the rear. As it approached, Takahara blazed away at it with the cannon. At the same time shots from the fighter tore through the body of the flying-boat. When the fighter was right upon them they saw that white smoke was issuing from its tail. As the fighter dived towards the sea Takahara fired a whole magazine (50 rounds)\ninto it. They saw the fighter hit the water ... Takahara discovered that his wireless operator had been hit and ... the flying-boat, too, with flames coming out of the door forward of the tanks ... Takahara felt the shock as they hit, opened the door and then lost consciousness. He came to in the water.<ref>S. Kikoku Takahara, 'Unbelievable happenings of people who died in the war', ''Eimusu'', 1983.</ref></blockquote>\n\nTakahara and the other five crewmen who survived the crash were able to draw some comfort from the knowledge that the Japanese Army Air Force did eventually capitalize on their success in locating the Allied convoy. The next morning they saw twenty-seven Japanese bombers flying south to attack the convoy. The flying boat crew were subsequently captured on Melville Island and eventually interned at [[Cowra breakout|Cowra]], where they took part in the famous break-out in August 1944.\n\nAnti-shipping operations were resumed on 18 February when the Army supply ship, {{MV|Don Isidro}},{{sfn|Masterson|1949|p=320}}<ref group=Note>Both ''Don Isidro'' and ''Florence D.'' were Philippine registered ships acquired in February 1942 as a part of the U.S. Army's \"Permanent Fleet\" in the South West Pacific Area.

She escaped serious damage and continued to steam in a westerly direction until early the next morning when she was attacked by bombers returning from the first Darwin raid. This time the ''Don Isidro'' caught fire and drifted ashore at Bathurst Island.

Soon afterwards, however, the ship was also attacked and sunk by twenty-seven dive-bombers from the [[1st Air Fleet of the Imperial Japanese Navy|1st Air Fleet]]. This was in effect the last anti-shipping strike of 1942. Japanese tactics had changed altogether by January 1943 when they resumed anti-shipping operations in the Arafura Sea and Torres Strait. The vital supply route to Darwin was constantly patrolled by small float-plane formations equipped with either Petes, Jakes or Nakajima B5Ns [[Nakajima B5N|(Kates)]]. A tactic commonly employed by Japanese pilots was to switch off the engine and dive out of the sun, which meant that the aircraft was neither heard nor seen until it had dropped its bomb. The supply ship [[HMAS Patricia Cam|HMAS ''Patricia Cam'']] was sunk in this fashion near Wessel Island on 22 January 1943. The store ship [http://www.flotilla-australia.com/images/macumba.jpg Macumba] was also sunk by float-planes at Millingimbi on 10 May, although on this occasion a [[Spitfire]] from No. 457 Squadron managed to shoot down one of the float-planes.<ref group=Note>For security reasons, the Australian military command instructed that the name [[Capstan (cigarette)|'Capstan']] (a popular cigarette brand at that time) be used to disguise the Spitfire's arrival in the Australian theatre of operations.</ref>\n\nThese anti-shipping operations did not cause any lasting disruption to the Allied coastal supply route and the Japanese flying boat bases at Taberfane and Dobo in the [[Aru Islands]] were constantly attacked throughout 1943 by [[No. 31 Squadron RAAF]] [[Bristol Beaufighter|Beaufighters]]. Radar-equipped [[Bristol Beaufort|Beauforts]] from [[No. 7 Squadron RAAF]] had also begun to take their toll and by early 1944 the Japanese anti-shipping campaign had been abandoned altogether. By this stage of the war the Japanese navy had lost seven float-planes over northern Australia as a direct result of aerial combat. The majority of these losses were attributed to large twin-engined bombers, such as the Beaufort or [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]], which do not generally take the offensive in aerial combat.\n\nReconnaissance operations were of secondary significance in terms of Japanese aircraft casualties. These operations were conducted primarily by Army Air Force Mitsubishi Ki46s ([[Mitsubishi Ki-46|Dinahs]]). Kawasaki Ki-48s ([[Kawasaki Ki-48|Lilys]]), Mitsubishi Ki-21 ([[Mitsubishi Ki-21|Sallys]]), C5Ms ([[Mitsubishi C5M|Babs]]) and Zeros were also used to a lesser degree, and a naval reconnaissance aircraft was the first to appear over Darwin on [http://www.ozatwar.com/japrecce/recce11.htm 10 February 1942]. Reconnaissance flights were conducted throughout the entire campaign and the last Japanese aircraft to fly over Australia during the second world war was a Mitsubishi Ki21 (Sally), piloted by Lieutenant Kiyoshi Iizuka.<ref>S. Gadja, 'Dinah Recovery in Western Australia', ''After  The Battle'', no. 39, 1983, pp. 41\u20134.</ref>\nReconnaissance operations were far more numerous than bombing operations, and yet only ten Japanese reconnaissance aircraft were ever destroyed by Allied fighters. The appearance of a reconnaissance aircraft usually indicated to those below that an attack by level bombers was imminent. Reconnaissance flights were generally made at altitudes in excess of 6000&nbsp;metres although Broome and Millingimbi, which had only light anti-aircraft defences, were both reconnoitred from below 3000&nbsp;metres. Sergeant Akira Hayashi was flying a Bab when he first  [[Air raid on Broome, 3 March 1942|reconnoitred Broome on 3 March 1942]]. The Bab was an antiquated design, even by 1942 standards, and this was probably the only occasion when one was ever used over Australia.\n\nThe nine Dinahs shot down over Australia are all thought to have belonged to the 70th Independent Squadron of the 7th Air Division, based at [[Koepang]] in Timor. The Dinah was extremely fast for its size and could reach speeds in excess of 600&nbsp;kilometres per hour. Radar plots showed that the Dinahs would cross the coast at extreme altitude and enter a shallow dive during the return flight, gradually gaining speed until they were well clear of the fighter and anti-aircraft defences. Japanese reconnaissance losses were quite acceptable given the frequency with which these operations were conducted. The 70th Squadron lost [http://www.ozatwar.com/ozcrashes/nt171.htm eight] Dinahs altogether, four of them being lost in a single day ([http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NAAMedia/ShowImage.asp?B=199104&S=12&T=P 17 August 1943]). Wing Commander C. R. Caldwell, Australia's leading [[Flying ace|ace]], accounted for one of these aircraft, and this happened also to be his last confirmed victory:\n\n<blockquote>I opened fire with all guns, my starboard cannon stopping almost immediately ... strikes were observed on the port side of the enemy aircraft fuselage, the starboard engine and tail unit. The starboard engine and fuselage immediately caught fire and some pieces of flying debris hit my own plane ... I flew behind it for several miles; it was now burning at three points and trailing white smoke ... The enemy aircraft appeared to make an attempt to level out momentarily and hit the water at a point 20&nbsp;miles [32 kilometres] due west of [[Cape Fourcroy]]. I photographed the splash with my camera gun and flew at zero feet around the debris observing three bodies in the water, two of which had partially opened parachutes attached ... One body was that of a large man in a black flying suit and helmet; he was lying spreadeagled on top of the water, face upward and I gained the impression that he was still alive.<ref>Australian Archives (AA):[http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NAAMedia/ShowImage.asp?B=199104&S=14&T=P CRS A1196, I/505/505, Spitfires Reccos, 17 August].  {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5wQnN2Ozi?url=http://recordsearch.naa.gov.au/NAAMedia/ShowImage.asp?B=199104&S=14&T=P |date=12 February 2011 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe losses sustained through anti-shipping and reconnaissance operations were comparatively slight, however, when it is considered that nearly one hundred and sixty Japanese aircraft were destroyed over Australia during the mainland bombing offensive. These operations were without doubt the most significant aspect of the entire campaign and have also been the subject of the most discussion. The bomber offensive not only accounted for the majority of Japanese aircraft shot down over Australia but also had the greatest strategic implications for the Allied war effort. It was because of the Japanese bomber offensive that the United States [[Fifth Air Force]] was forced to divert both fighter and heavy bomber aircraft to the [[Northern Territory]] at a time when it was critically short of both. The Allied Commander at that time, General MacArthur, also directed his air force commander, [[George C. Kenney|General Kenney]], to prepare for the rapid transfer of squadrons to airfields around Torres Strait and in the Northern Territory should the Australian mainland come under threat of invasion. To augment these plans the RAAF Directorate of Works was ordered to proceed as quickly as possible with the development of a network of airbases from [[Truscott Airfield]] in the west to [http://www.ozatwar.com/airfields/higginsfield.htm Jacky Jacky (Higgins Field)] in the north of Queensland. The RAAF became so heavily committed to patrolling the Australian coastline that by April 1943 it had reached the stage where it had more operational squadrons on duty in Australia than in the northern frontline theatres of New Guinea.\n\nThe operations discussed in this category were directed exclusively against land-based targets such as Townsville, Horn Island, [[Fenton Airfield|Fenton]]Fenton and Millingimbi. The Japanese bomber offensive commenced on 19 February 1942 and ended on 12 November 1943 with the last raids against Darwin and Fenton. The Naval Air Force supplied most aircraft for the bomber offensive although it is now known that the Army Air Force participated in at least two raids (19 February 1942 and 20 June 1943).\n\nBetty bombers from the [[25th Air Flotilla#cite note-4|Kanoya]] and 753rd Air Corps were used most often in these operations although Kates, Sallys, Lilys, Mitsubishi G3Ms ([[Mitsubishi G3M|Nells]]), Aichi D3As ([[Aichi D3A|Vals]]) and Nakajima Ki49s ([[Nakajima Ki-49|Helens]]) were all used to a lesser extent. The raids on Townsville and [http://www.skp.com.au/memorials2/pages/40238.htm Mossman] in July 1943 were another exception to this general rule as these were carried out by Emily flying boats from the 14th (Yokosuka) Air Group, operating at extreme range from Rabaul, New Britain.\n\nLand-based bombers participating in daylight raids were invariably accompanied by Mitsubishi Zero fighters, described variously as Haps, Hamps or Zekes. The cost of protecting the bombers was high and there were almost as many fighters destroyed as there were bombers. The Zeros participating in the first Darwin raid were all attached to the [[1st Air Fleet (Imperial Japanese Navy)|1st Air Fleet]]. However, the fleet had to withdraw from the area after 19 February, at which stage the [http://home.brisnet.org.au/~dunn/jnaf/jnaf.htm 3rd, 4th, and 202nd Air Corps] had to share responsibility for escorting the bombers. The first raids against Darwin, Broome and Townsville have all been described elsewhere in great detail and so will not be dealt with again in this article. 11 The intention of the following discussion is to provide a general analysis of the bomber offensive against Darwin after February 1942.\n\nDarwin was bombed on sixty-four separate occasions, each of which can be classified according to one of five distinct bombing patterns which alternated between daylight and night attacks. For months at a time the Japanese air forces would adhere to the same attack procedure, giving the Allies numerous opportunities for predicting when and where the next attack was likely to occur. The Japanese became so predictable in this regard that one diarist, writing after the raid on 31 March 1942 made the following observation: <blockquote>This is getting monotonous \u2013 the same. Slight variation this time, however, because they also came over at 10&nbsp;p.m..</blockquote>\n\nThese comments were made during the first phase of operations when the raiding force usually consisted of seven bombers, escorted by at least an equal number of fighters. The last of these raids, led by Lieutenant Fujimara, took place on 5 April 1942.\n\n====April\u2013December 1942====\nThe pattern of attack changed dramatically on 25 April that year when the 753rd Air Corps, led by Lieutenant Commander Matsumi, arrived over Darwin with a force of twenty-four bombers escorted by fifteen fighters. This later proved to be one of the most costly raids of the war with thirteen aircraft failing to return. The 23rd Air Flotilla could ill afford to sustain such high losses and by mid-June it was forced to abandon the practice of mounting large-scale daylight raids.\n\nThe Japanese aircraft strength on Timor, [[Bali]], and Ambon was now reported to be fifty-seven fighters, sixty-nine bombers and four observation aircraft, with a heavier concentration of aircraft at [[Kendari]]. Until then the Japanese had operated very consistently with most flights arriving over the target during the early afternoon. However, when operations resumed during the last week of July after a six-week lapse, the bombers arrived over the target under cover of darkness. Most formations were dramatically reduced in size and on six consecutive nights, beginning on 25 July, the city was bombed by small shotai (three-plane) formations. The attacks were all made from altitudes in excess of 6,600&nbsp;metres (21,654&nbsp;feet) and the damage was minimal.\n\nWhile these nocturnal forays may have caused little in the way of material damage, they did have a demoralizing effect on Darwin's population. As one Department of Civil Aviation official noted at the time:{{citequote|date=August 2013}}<blockquote> We waited for the fifth raid of 27 bombers in succession with a sick feeling in the pit of the stomach. We could not keep our eyes off the burning tanks. The town was deserted by everybody except a few suckers like ourselves whose work kept them there. The raid did not eventuate. I think it was the worst day in my life I have spent to date, just waiting for something to eventuate, which did not.</blockquote>\n\nThe Japanese subsequently used this tactic to great advantage, repeatedly sending over small unescorted formations at night. Elsewhere in the Pacific these lone intruders would remain overhead for hours on end, periodically dropping a bomb to make sure no one got to sleep.\n\nThe night bombing pattern was maintained, almost without variation, for the next six months. On 2 March 1943 there was a switch back to daylight operations when Lieutenant Commander Takahide Aioi's force of sixteen Zeros (202nd [[K\u014dk\u016btai]]) escorted nine Betty bombers (753rd K\u014dk\u016btai) on a raid against the satellite airfield at [[Coomalie Creek Airfield|Coomalie]].<ref>This was the first time that Spitfires were used in combat, in the North Western Area. A detailed description of this, the 52nd raid against Darwin, is available in Andrew Thomas's ''Spitfire Aces of Burma and the Pacific'' (Osprey Publishing, 2009, p.9).</ref> [[File:Raid 52.jpg|thumb|left|No 1 (Fighter) Wing radar tracks for the 2 March 1943 raid against Coomalie, N.T.

These monthly attacks continued through to 13 August when the procedure underwent one final change. The army's 7th Air Division had by this stage withdrawn from Ambon to [[Wewak]], leaving the 23rd Air Flotilla to carry on the campaign. The bombers continued to come over at night until 12 November 1943 when Darwin was attacked for the very last time. While the night bombers were inaccurate, they ran little risk of interception by fighters. Only twice during the entire bombing campaign did Allied fighters succeed in destroying Japanese bombers at night.

One 36-aircraft fighter squadron of the 23rd Air Flotilla with 12 reserves was sent to [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in December, and a 36-aircraft bomber squadron with 12 reserves was sent to [[Kwajalein]] in the Central Pacific to await the expected advance of the American fleet.\n\nThe defence of northern Australia was an international effort involving elements of the [[RAAF]], the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF), the British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) and the [[Netherlands East Indies Air Force]] (NEIAF). The RAAF, RAF and NEIAF were, however, unable to make any significant contribution to the north Australian war effort until late 1942. The RAAF had a number of [[Wirraway]] trainers and [[Lockheed Hudson|Hudson]] medium bombers based in the region during early 1942 but these were unsuited to the type of combat dictated by the Japanese.[[File:Cresswll Betty.jpg|thumb|right|A group of RAAF personnel at the site of the wreckage of a Japanese 'Betty' bomber aircraft shot down by Squadron Leader R C Cresswell during a night raid on Darwin. The bodies of nine Japanese were later found near the wrecked bomber.(Australian War Memorial ID number 013716 [http://cas.awm.gov.au/screen_img/013716])]]\n\nThe northern air war was essentially a fighter conflict with Kittyhawks and Spitfires pitted against Zeros and well-armed Betty bombers. The Kittyhawks of the United States [http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/49fg.htm 49th Fighter Group] bore the brunt of the early operations and eventually accounted for almost half the Japanese aircraft shot down over Australia. It was the 49th Group which also developed the diving-pass system of attack that was to become standard procedure for all Allied fighters in the North-Western Area. The Japanese would often arrive at altitudes in excess of 6600&nbsp;metres (21,654&nbsp;feet) and the Allies' greatest defence, in these circumstances, was the early warning radar network which could detect incoming formations at distances of up to 240&nbsp;kilometres (130 nautical miles). The Allied fighters were generally less manoeuvreable than the Zero, and still had to climb rapidly to be able to attack the Japanese from above.\n\nThe rapid climb tactic that was used throughout the war imposed severe limitations on the fighters' endurance and Allied aircraft were often forced to cut short their engagements. Ninety-two per cent of all Japanese aircraft shot down over northern Australia were in fact shot down by Kittyhawks and Spitfires. The remaining thirteen aircraft were all destroyed by either anti-aircraft fire, Beauforts, Hudsons or Beaufighters.\n\nMost Japanese losses were sustained during daylight attacks against targets in the Northern Territory, Port Darwin in particular. However, more than half these attacks occurred at night when the Allied fighters, lacking air-to-air radar, were generally unable to intercept their attackers.\n\nThe Americans were also at a distinct disadvantage when the Japanese launched their first attack on Darwin. Since 15 February 1942 the newly activated [[33rd Pursuit Squadron]] had been flying patrol over the waters north-west of Darwin. On 19 February, however, its planes had been scheduled for an attempt to get through to Timor. In fact ten of the squadron's P-40s had taken off for Koepang at approximately 9.00&nbsp;a.m. but had to return half an hour later because of an unfavourable weather report. It was therefore more the result of good luck, rather than good management, that Darwin was not left completely undefended during the first Japanese air attack. In the event the American Kittyhawks could offer little more than token resistance to the 1st Air Fleet which arrived over Darwin undetected, and in overwhelming numbers. The Japanese pilots were also experienced combat veterans whereas the majority of the American pilots were pitifully inexperienced, some having as little as twelve hours' experience in combat aircraft.\n\nNine Kittyhawks were destroyed in quick succession and only Lieutenant Robert Oestreicher managed to bring his bullet-punctured [http://www.google.com.au/search?q=Lieutenant+Robert+Oestreicher&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8&aq=t&rls=org.mozilla:en-GB:official&client=firefox-a P-40 (\"Miss Nadine\" #43)] to a normal landing. Oestreicher was the only American pilot to shoot down a Japanese aircraft during this historic action. The following extract from his combat report describes the events of that morning:\n<blockquote>After flying about among the clouds for about half an hour I spotted two [[Nakajima B5N|series 97 dive bombers]] with a fixed landing gear on a course heading for [[Batchelor Airfield|Batchelor]] Field. Intercepting them at about 1500&nbsp;feet [approximately 5OO metres] I fired and saw one definitely burst into flames and go down. The other was smoking slightly as he headed for the clouds. I lost him in the clouds.</blockquote>\n\nLate that same afternoon the report came through that a coast artillery battery had located both planes within a mile [1.6 kilometres] of each other. These are the first confirmed aerial victories on Australian soil.\n\nThe Japanese 1st Air Fleet is conservatively estimated to have lost five aircraft during the first Darwin raid. Australian anti-aircraft gunners accounted for one Zero and one bomber while a second Zero was later found crash-landed on Melville Island. This last aircraft, which was still relatively intact, gave Allied intelligence officers their first opportunity to try to establish the basis of the Zero's phenomenal performance. A detailed examination of the aircraft established such crucial factors as maximum range and firepower and also highlighted a number of significant weaknesses such as the lack of fuel tank protection, pilot armour, and armoured glass. Equally significant was the discovery that the Japanese were using Swedish-designed cannons and American-designed direction-finding compasses, propellers and machine-guns. The Zero had already begun to look vulnerable.\n\nDiscoveries like these were the concern of the [http://www.ozatwar.com/usaaf/atiu.htm Technical Air Intelligence Unit] (TAIU) which had established a sub-unit in the North-Western Area during October 1942. The TAIU was an American unit, based in [[Brisbane]], which was responsible for evaluating and monitoring the development of Japanese aircraft. The unit's north Australian representative was an Australian, Pilot Officer Crook, who was constantly competing with souvenir hunters for access to Japanese aircraft wreckage. Crook's main task. was to examine enemy aircraft wreckage and collect any data plates that had escaped the attention of the souvenir hunters, so as to monitor changes in armament, crew capacity, camouflage, airframe and engine design. By comparing serial numbers and production dates it was possible also to estimate production rates for individual aircraft types.\n\nIntelligence data turned up in the most unlikely circumstances, as for example in September 1942 when a 'party of [[No. 77 Squadron RAAF|77 squadron]] personnel while on leave discovered two attache cases, with Jap markings, found to contain electrically heated flying suits and other personal gear'. It was the examination of crash-sites, however, which often yielded the most information. The unit's greatest coup was the salvage of Betty T359, which was the first Japanese aircraft shot down over Australia at night during air-to-air combat. The aircraft had crashed on Koolpinyah Station, where it was later discovered substantially intact. An examination of the wreckage revealed that the Betty carried a crew of nine rather than seven, as was previously thought.\n\nOn 27 February Lieutenant Oestreicher received telegraphic orders to fly south and report to the 49th Fighter Group at Bankstown. General MacArthur had agreed that the 49th Fighter Group, commanded by Colonel Paul Wurtsmith, should be diverted to the Northern Territory. However, Darwin was left undefended for almost four weeks before the first elements of the group arrived on 14 March. In the meantime the Japanese had broadened the scope of their attacks to include Broome, Wyndham and Horn Island. The Allies had no fighter defences at Broome or Wyndham when Japanese fighters attacked on 3 March 1942. Twenty-four Allied aircraft were destroyed in the space of fifteen minutes whereas only one Zero, piloted by Chief Air Sergeant Osamu Kudo, was brought down by anti-aircraft\ngunners.\n\nThe Japanese met with stiff opposition, however, when they first attacked Horn Island on 14 March. Eight Nell bombers and nine Zeros arrived over the target at 1.00&nbsp;p.m. and were intercepted by nine P-40s of the 7th Fighter Squadron, which was then staging through on its way to Darwin. This was the first time that the Japanese Air Force had encountered any significant fighter opposition over mainland Australia and the result, so far as the Japanese were concerned, was less than encouraging. The Americans shot down four Zeros and one bomber while one American aircraft was destroyed and one damaged. Two of the Zeros were shot down by Second Lieutenant House, Jr.  Although Horn Island was attacked again on numerous occasions, the Japanese always managed to avoid interception by\nAllied fighters.\n\nKittyhawks of the 49th Fighter Group had arrived in Darwin by mid-March and on 22 March they carried out their first interception. Nine bombers, three Zeros and one reconnaissance aircraft had penetrated 300&nbsp;kilometres inland to Katherine, dropping one stick of bombs from high altitude. An Aborigine was killed, another wounded, and some damage was done to the aerodrome. The 9th Fighter Squadron only managed to destroy one Nakajima reconnaissance plane, but in doing so they helped pioneer the use of early warning radar in the south-west Pacific. Early warning radar was without doubt the single most important factor to influence the outcome of the north Australian air war. Without adequate warning the Allied fighters could offer little defence against the enemy formations which invariably arrived over the mainland at extreme altitude.\nThe 22 March raid was in fact the first successful radar-controlled intercept of the war. By detecting the incoming formation at a range of approximately 130&nbsp;kilometres the CSIR's experimental radar station at Dripstone Caves, near Darwin, had effectively proved the usefulness of the concept of radar-controlled interception to a largely pessimistic military and civilian community.\n\nRadar was no longer a new-fangled invention to be regarded with suspicion, but a valuable weapon. Faith in its efficacy grew rapidly, sometimes to limits\nbeyond its deserving. It was well known to the radiophysicists that the air warning set did not, because of the interference of radio waves reflected from the earth, cover regions near the ground. Had the Japanese known this, they could, by flying at low level, have come quite close to the target before\ntheir presence was detected. Fortunately for Britain, even the German pilots did not know of this trick early in the war. The German pilots did learn it later, and long after the Darwin raids passed the trick on to the Japanese just as their air strength was nearly exhausted. The Americans failed to intercept during the next five raids and on 2 April the Shell oil refineries in Harvey Street were struck by bomb splinters, causing 136 000 litres of aviation spirit to be lost. Two days later, however, the Kittyhawks were ready and waiting when seven bombers and six fighters attacked the civil airfield at Darwin. The 9th Fighter Squadron destroyed five bombers and two Zeros, losing only one of its own aircraft and damaging two. This engagement, needless to say, did much to restore confidence within the beleaguered community. Second Lieutenants John Landers and Andrew Reynolds both managed to destroy two aircraft each during this encounter.\n\nThe anti-aircraft defences also put in an outstanding effort on this occasion and the Australian {{convert|3.7|in|mm|adj=on}} guns at Fanny Bay brought down two enemy bombers. One eyewitness described the view from the ground in the following dramatic terms:{{citequote|date=August 2013}}\n:Day of days. Our first victory. Seven bombers appeared supported by several fighters. As the bombers came over the point the very first two rounds from the A.A. burst just behind the formation and got five bombers of the seven. One blew up immediately. Another, badly ablaze, screamed down towards the ground. The others, with amazing discipline tried to keep formation. I saw a Jap jump out of one of the blazing machines \u2013 just a small black dot. His parachute opened but a burning piece of plane fell on it. The Jap fell rapidly and landed just on the other side of the aerodrome.\n\nNo less dramatic were the independent reports received the following day of 'hostile fighters flying at about 4/500' with American markings'. The gunners at the oval 'reported distinct Zero features with USA markings'.{{citequote|date=August 2013}} The fact that these reports were made independently, and at relatively close range, gives them credibility.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nThe anti-aircraft guns played an important role throughout the campaign by ensuring that the bombers remained at an altitude from which accurate bombing became very difficult. The Australian gunners were very effective in this regard even though they only managed to shoot down a total of eight enemy aircraft.\nDarwin had, up until 4 April, been defended by just one squadron of American fighters. The city began to feel less defenceless when reinforcements arrived two days later in the form of the 7th Fighter Squadron. The 8th Fighter Squadron had also arrived by 15 April, giving the 49th Fighter Group its full complement of sixty aircraft. Never again were the Allies to be outnumbered as they had been at the start of the war.\n\nThe group was able to repeat its earlier successes when, on 25 April, it destroyed thirteen enemy aircraft in an enemy formation comprising twenty-four bombers and fifteen fighters. Three of the bombers were shot down by Second Lieutenant James Morehead of the 8th Fighter Squadron. First Lieutenant George Kiser managed to duplicate this feat two days later when he too destroyed two bombers and one Zero. This was to be the last raid for some time as the 23rd Air Flotilla then refrained from attacking Australia for almost six weeks. The 49th Fighter Group had thus far compiled a very creditable record. Prior to May it had lost eight of its P-40s and three pilots while destroying a total of thirty-eight Japanese planes and an estimated 135 crewmen. The 49th's combat record was in fact the only bright spot in the Allied war effort which was then still largely defensive.\n\nThe 49th Fighter Group had been in combat for more than two months when the British prime minister announced on 28 May that he was sending three Spitfire squadrons to Australia. The squadrons chosen were No. 54 Squadron (RAF) and two Empire Air Training Scheme squadrons, Nos 452 and 457, both of which had been formed in Britain in June 1941. 'The arrangement was that each squadron would receive sixteen aircraft as initial equipment and replacements at the rate of five aircraft per squadron per month.' 23 Unfortunately the first consignment of forty-two Spitfires was diverted to the Middle East following the fall of Tobruk on 21 June. Almost four months were to pass before the second consignment of seventy-one Spitfires arrived in Australia.\n\nThe large-scale daylight raids recommenced on 13 June and continued for four successive days. It was during the last of these raids, on 16 June, that the 49th Fighter Group suffered its first major set-back, losing five of its Kittyhawks while destroying only two enemy aircraft. The Americans still had some cause for celebration as Second Lieutenant Reynolds had managed to shoot down his fifth Japanese aircraft during operations in northern Australia. Reynolds thus became the first ace of the Australian campaign. Five other Allied pilots were to earn this distinction by the time the campaign ended in July 1944. It is not known{{to whom|date=August 2013}} if any Japanese pilots ever emerged as aces from this theatre of operations.\n\nThe bombers arrived under cover of darkness during July, leaving the 49th Fighter Group powerless to do anything more than watch. The scope of the Japanese attacks was broadened towards the end of the month to include Port Hedland in Western Australia and Townsville in north Queensland. Port Hedland was of little strategic significance, but Townsville was the largest aircraft depot in northern Australia. It was also an important staging point for aircraft en route to New Guinea and the Central Pacific Area. This interlude brought consciousness of the air war more sharply into focus for the Australian people. For three successive nights from 25 July, Townsville was bombed by Emily flying boats of the 14th (Yokosuka) Air Group. Six American Airacobras of the 8th Fighter Group were alerted and airborne during the second alert, while the intruder was still 80&nbsp;kilometres distant. The Emily managed to drop its bombs and avoid being intercepted despite these elaborate preparations. The Yokosuka Air Group  returned again the following night, as if spurred on by its earlier success. This time, however, Emily number W37 was intercepted by two Airacobras from the 36th Fighter Squadron, which scored a number of hits on the huge flying boat. It escaped apparently without serious damage and an Allied wireless operator subsequently intercepted a transmission indicating that W37 had arrived back at Rabaul.\n\nThat the radar station at Kissing Point in Townsville managed to detect the enemy flying boats at extreme range. The RAAF's need for an early warning radar network had become so critical that by early 1942 the Australian Radiophysics Laboratory was asked to modify a number of SCR268 anti-aircraft gunnery sets which had arrived in Australia after the Americans were forced to evacuate the Philippines. The first set to be modified in this manner was erected at Kissing Point where, in July 1942, it gave an outstanding one-hour-fifty-minute warning of an approaching enemy aircraft.\n\nSuccesses like these were not always the order of the day: at Exmouth Gulf in Western Australia on 24 September 1943 a flock of birds sitting atop the antenna triggered an air raid alert.\n\nThe 23rd Air Flotilla had in the meantime resumed its daylight bombing campaign against Port Darwin. The 49th Fighter Group was equipped at the time with early model Kittyhawk P-40Es which were outclassed by the nimble Zero fighters. The Americans were quick to realize that their best defence was to dive through the enemy formation, safe in the knowledge that the Zero would be unable to follow at the same speed. On 30 July the 49th had an opportunity to demonstrate that it could achieve creditable results, providing its Kittyhawks had the height advantage. On this particular occasion, Darwin's twenty-sixth air raid, the Americans had been given ample warning of the incoming attack and were thus able to strike the enemy from above, destroying six bombers and three fighters and losing only one P-40. Second Lieutenant John Landers emerged from this combat as the group's second ace after having already destroyed three enemy aircraft during an earlier engagement.\n\nOn the following day Port Moresby was raided for the seventy-seventh time. The formations which attacked Darwin, however, were in general much larger than those which attacked Port Moresby. As late as September 1943 the 23rd Air Flotilla could still assemble a force of thirty-seven aircraft, whereas in New Guinea the Japanese attacking formations became smaller and smaller as the war progressed.\n\nThe first Australian reinforcements arrived during August 1942 when twenty-four Kittyhawks from No. 77 Squadron commenced operations at Livingstone. The squadron's arrival coincided with a period of reduced enemy activity and although it remained in the region until early 1943, it later left for Milne Bay without ever meeting the Japanese on equal terms. The squadron's commanding officer, Wing Commander Cresswell, did however achieve one notable success when he shot down a Betty bomber of the Takao Air Group on the night of 23 November 1942. This was the first successful night interception of the north Australian war.\n\nNo. 77 Squadron arrived in the Northern Territory just as the veteran American 49th Fighter Group was preparing to leave after five months of continuous combat. The group fought its final battle on 23 August when a very large enemy force of twenty-seven bombers and twenty-seven fighters attempted to bomb the Hudsons based at Hughes Field. Twenty-four Kittyhawks from the 7th and 8th Fighter Squadrons managed to intercept the formation, shooting down fifteen Japanese aircraft for the loss of just one P-40. This later proved to be the most successful combat of the entire campaign. It also gave the group its third ace, First Lieutenant James Morehead, who shot down two Zeros over Cape Fourcroy on Melville Island. The group left north Australia with a final tally of seventy-nine Japanese aircraft which had cost them twenty-one Kittyhawks (and two damaged).\n\nThe Americans' departure was timed to coincide with the arrival of replacement fighters from Britain. These had arrived in Sydney during October which was fortunate for the Allies, as this represented a period of reduced activity for the 23rd Air Flotilla. No. 76 Squadron also arrived at Strauss during October but, as was the case with No. 77 Squadron, they too departed soon afterwards without having seen much combat.\n\nNo. 31 Squadron's arrival at Coomalie the same month represented a turning point in the war. The Allied air forces had, up until then, been fighting a defensive campaign over their own bases. The introduction of Beaufighters gave the Allies a potent weapon with which to attack the enemy in his own territory. Unlike the Mitchells and Hudsons which had been conducting offensive operations almost from the start of the war, the Beaufighters of No. 31 Squadron were designed exclusively as ground attack aircraft and did much to increase the enemy's rate of attrition.\n\n====January\u2013May 1943====\nThe Capstans which had arrived from Britain the previous month had, by late 1942, finished training at Richmond in New South Wales and been regrouped under the banner of No. 1 Fighter Wing (RAAF). The wing was commanded by Group Captain Walters and the wing leader was Wing Commander Caldwell who was at that time the RAAF's leading ace. The wing transferred to the Northern Territory in January 1943 with No. 54 Squadron based at Darwin, No. 452 at Strauss, and No. 457 at Livingstone. No. 18 Squadron (NEIAF) also arrived during the same month, emphasizing the shift to the offensive.\n\nThe wing had barely commenced operations when it scored its first victory on 6 February 1943. Flight Lieutenant Foster of No. 54 Squadron was vectored to intercept an incoming Dinah which he shot down over the sea near Cape Van Diemen.\n\nThis initial excitement was followed by almost four weeks of inactivity until 2 March, when nine Kates and sixteen Zeros made a daylight attack on the No. 31 Squadron Beaufighters at Coomalie. Caldwell led No. 54 Squadron in a successful interception and he personally succeeded in shooting down his first Zero, as well as a Kate bomber. The Japanese lost three aircraft altogether and although there were no Capstans shot down, one Beaufighter was destroyed on the ground (A19-31). Five days later No. 457 Squadron recorded its first victory. Four aircraft were scrambled to intercept Japanese aircraft reported to be over Bathurst Island. They were ordered to 4500&nbsp;metres and found a Dinah heading for home over the sea about twenty-five kilometres from Darwin. Flight Lieutenant MacLean and Flight Sergeant McDonald each made two attacks at close range and the enemy plunged into the sea burning fiercely.\n\nThe wing had its first full-scale encounter with the Japanese on 15 March when all three Capstan squadrons intercepted a very large force of twenty-two Bettys escorted by twenty-seven Zeros. Using the European tactic of dogfighting the Capstans managed to shoot down six Bettys and two Zeros, losing four of their own aircraft. However, the bombers did manage to hit six oil tanks, setting two of them on fire. Squadron Leader Goldsmith, who destroyed two aircraft during this engagement, later wrote in his log-book:{{citequote|date=August 2013}}\nSquirted at a Hap while his No. 2 came round behind me. Knocked lumps off wing, was hit in tail wheel and wing root. Followed bombers 80&nbsp;miles [128 kilometres] out to sea, attacked out of sun. Got a Hap on way down, made two attacks on Betty which broke formation. Landed with 3 galls [14 litres] petrol, tail wheel broke off when I touched down.\n\nGoldsmith's reference to having only three gallons of fuel left was a warning which went unheeded. The [http://home.st.net.au/~dunn/49fg.htm 49th Fighter Group] had learnt through experience that there was nothing to be gained by [[dogfight]]ing with a Zero. This type of combat resulted in increased fuel consumption which if left unchecked could lead to fuel starvation. The Kittyhawk pilots had therefore developed the diving-pass technique and avoided close quarter combat whenever this was possible.\n\nThe Spitfires persisted with the dogfighting technique until 2 May when five aircraft had to carry out forced landings through lack of fuel. A further three Spitfires made forced landings because of engine failure and all but two of these eight aircraft were later recovered. At the time, however, it looked as if the wing had lost thirteen aircraft and the fact that all the bombers had reached their target without loss only made the situation look much worse. To add insult to injury, the press obtained the casualty figures, and made much of the fact that this was the first occasion when any communique had reported heavy losses.\n\nThe Advisory War Council had little choice but to order an official inquiry and called for a special report from the Chief of Air Staff. As a result of these investigations the Capstans were fitted with drop-tanks and dogfighting was banned altogether.\n\n====June\u2013November 1943====\nThe Japanese 7th Air Regiment encountered a more disciplined opposition when it next attacked Darwin on 20 June. The wing achieved its best result, shooting down fourteen enemy aircraft while losing just three Capstans. 27\nIt was during this encounter that Wing Commander Caldwell, who was already a European theatre ace, shot down his fifth Japanese aircraft.\n\nThe USAAF 380 Bomb Group's arrival in the Northern Territory had not escaped the enemy's notice and on 30 June they switched their attentions to Fenton where the Liberator B-24s were based. So significant were the long-range Liberator strikes that the Japanese now focused their attacks almost exclusively on Fenton. The American airbase was to remain their primary target for all future bombing attacks, right up until the last Japanese raid on 12 November 1943.\n\nThe Liberators because of their great range and bomb-carrying capacity were making the most effective contribution achieved from North-Western Area. Their geographical position in the Northern Territory enabled them to strike at targets far behind the Japanese front lines which were out of the reach of other Fifth Air Force bomber groups in New Guinea. These activities made a worthwhile contribution to MacArthur's advance along the north New Guinea coast by destroying installations and forcing the enemy to retain defences well to the rear thereby weakening the front. 28\nThe Capstans subsequently shot down two more Dinahs, bringing the wing's total to seventy-six, slightly less than that of the 49th Fighter Group. No. 1 Fighter Wing had, in the course of the war, lost thirty-six Capstans and suffered damage to nine others.\n\nElsewhere, far to the east of Darwin, No. 7 Squadron (RAAF) had also begun to notch up an impressive record. No. 7 Squadron's Beauforts regularly patrolled the western approaches to Horn Island in an effort to protect the vital shipping lanes through the Torres Strait. The Australian-built Beaufort Mk VIIIs were equipped with ASV (air-to-surface vessel) radar and on 18 June, aircraft number A9-296, piloted by Flying Officer Hopton, made the first successful radar interception within the Australian war zone. The crew of A9-296 saw an indication of an enemy plane on its radar screen at about ten kilometres distance. This proved to be a Jake float-plane which was attacked by the Beaufort and crashed into the sea.\n\nNo. 7 Squadron subsequently made two more successful interceptions, one of which must surely rank as the war's most bizarre combat. Flying Officer Legge was flying Beaufort A9-329 on 20 September 1943 when he sighted a 'Jake' 42&nbsp;miles [67 kilometres] west of Cape Valsch, and attacked it. The enemy aircraft force-landed in the water and the pilot dived overboard. An attempt by Legge to bomb the 'Jake' in the water was unsuccessful, but the Beaufort came down to 100' [30 metres], and the navigator straddled the enemy aircraft with a burst from his nose gun, causing the 'Jake' to burst into flames. 29\nThe Allied defence of northern Australia must be judged a success given that the Allied air forces destroyed 174 aircraft during the twenty-nine months after February 1942, losing only sixty-eight Kittyhawks and Capstans themselves. The Japanese personnel losses were much higher than these figures suggest as more than half the aircraft lost by the Japanese were bombers, usually Bettys, which each carried seven crewmen.\n\n===Results===\nThe Japanese Air Force never actually reduced the intensity or frequency of its operations, despite these heavy losses. Darwin was attacked by large enemy formations as late as September 1943 and indeed the Northern Territory was still being bombed well after raids on Port Moresby had stopped. The Japanese Air Force also achieved some measure of success by consistently attacking Australia while being on the defensive in most other theatres.\n\nAlthough the damage caused by these attacks was relatively slight, the cost to the Allies in terms of their delayed offensives and diverted resources was considerable, particularly during 1942. The north Australian air war might therefore be described as a thorn in MacArthur's side in the sense that it was never completely crippling, but always a cause of concern. In the event, the contest for air superiority over northern Australia was finally decided in the skies over Rabaul and the northern Solomons. The Japanese Naval Air Force, having suffered heavy losses in these areas, was forced to redistribute, using aircraft from the 23rd Air  Flotilla. Likewise, the Japanese army's 7th Air Division was also relocated to compensate for losses elsewhere in the Pacific.\n\nThe north Australian air war will always be regarded{{by whom|date=August 2013}} as a significant, rather than a crucial battle. There were no real winners or losers and yet to all Australians, then as now this episode will always be remembered as a turning point in Australian history. Australians had become complacent after 154 years of peaceful settlement, safe in the belief that their isolation would keep them free from foreign aggression. For most people living in Australia in February 1942 the war was still a slightly abstract notion involving foreign people, places and ideals. On 19 February, however, World War II became a reality for all Australians, destroying once and for all the notion that Australia was inviolable.\n\n{| border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"3px\"\n|+\n\n===Allied and Japanese aircraft losses===\n\n!

He later spent time that season on loan at [[EFL League One|League One]] club [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]], scoring twice in eight appearances.

After the first seven appearances, during which Derby lost five times, drew twice, only scored three goals and sacked manager Paul Clement, he lost his place in the starting line-up. This coincided with a return to form for the team, who won two of their next three matches, with Ince making second-half substitute appearances. He was restored to the starting eleven on 5 March for a 2\u20130 win against Huddersfield Town and ended his barren spell two matches later on 12 March, scoring a brace either side of a Chris Martin goal to give ''The Rams'' a 3\u20130 lead against Rotherham United. However, three late Rotherham goals saw the away side rescue a point. Ince rounded out the season with two more goals: the second in a 4\u20131 thrashing of Bolton Wanderers on 9 April and the 57th-minute winner in a 3\u20132 victory at Bristol City on 19 April. Derby finished the season in fifth place and played fourth-placed Hull City in the [[2016 Football League play-offs#Championship|play-off semi-finals]], losing 3\u20130 at home and winning 2\u20130 away to go out 3\u20132 on aggregate to the eventual [[2016 Football League Championship play-off Final|play-off Final]] winners. Ince did not score his first goal of the 2016\u201317 season until 27 September, the first in a 2\u20130 win at Cardiff City. In November, he scored four goals in back-to-back games: braces each in a 3\u20132 win at Wolves on 5 November and in a 3\u20130 win over Rotherham on 19 November.

After the first seven appearances, during which Derby lost five times, drew twice, only scored three goals and sacked manager Paul Clement, he lost his place in the starting line-up.

He was restored to the starting eleven on 5 March for a 2\u20130 win against Huddersfield Town and ended his barren spell two matches later on 12 March, scoring a brace either side of a Chris Martin goal to give ''The Rams'' a 3\u20130 lead against Rotherham United. However, three late Rotherham goals saw the away side rescue a point. Ince rounded out the season with two more goals: the second in a 4\u20131 thrashing of Bolton Wanderers on 9 April and the 57th-minute winner in a 3\u20132 victory at Bristol City on 19 April. Derby finished the season in fifth place and played fourth-placed Hull City in the [[2016 Football League play-offs#Championship|play-off semi-finals]], losing 3\u20130 at home and winning 2\u20130 away to go out 3\u20132 on aggregate to the eventual [[2016 Football League Championship play-off Final|play-off Final]] winners. Ince did not score his first goal of the 2016\u201317 season until 27 September, the first in a 2\u20130 win at Cardiff City. In November, he scored four goals in back-to-back games: braces each in a 3\u20132 win at Wolves on 5 November and in a 3\u20130 win over Rotherham on 19 November.

Marco stepped down from the role of vocalist and was joined by local musician Roland Krueger on bass. In 2000, they recorded one demo that was released on the internet and after its release, current drummer Gerit Lamm joined the band. The female vocalist that recorded the demo left the band to follow other plans and was replaced by [[Lisa Middelhauve|Lisa Schaphaus]]. At the same time, writing of the debut album started.\n\nIn 2002, the band signed to [[Drakkar Records]] and was joined by current lead guitarist Philip Restemeier. As work on the debut album progressed, the band started playing shows in and around Bielefeld. In the winter of 2002, the band entered the studio to record their debut album ''[[Kill the Sun]]''. They released ''Kill the Sun'' in May 2003, and it reached No. 98 on the German music charts.<ref name=ML>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Xandria/?type=longplay |title=Xandria \u2014 Longplay-Chartverfolgung |language=German |work=musicline.de |publisher=Phononet GmbH |accessdate=5 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010132340/http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Xandria/?type=longplay |archive-date=10 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> To promote the album, the band played a few shows with [[Schandmaul]] and [[Subway to Sally]].

Recording of the album began in December 2003 at Pleasure Park Studios, with producer Jos\u00e9 Alvarez-Brill. Production on the album was finished in February 2004. Shortly after the recordings were completed, bassist Roland Krueger left the band and was replaced by Nils Middelhauve. ''[[Ravenheart]]'' was released on May 24, 2004, and it stayed on the charts for seven weeks, reaching No. 36.<ref name=ML/>\n\nIn 2005 they released their third album, ''[[India (Xandria album)|India]]'', which reached No. 30 on the German charts.<ref name=ML/> Xandria began recording their fourth album, ''[[Salom\u00e9 \u2013 The Seventh Veil]]'', on December 14, 2006.

Marco stepped down from the role of vocalist and was joined by local musician Roland Krueger on bass. In 2000, they recorded one demo that was released on the internet and after its release, current drummer Gerit Lamm joined the band. The female vocalist that recorded the demo left the band to follow other plans and was replaced by [[Lisa Middelhauve|Lisa Schaphaus]]. At the same time, writing of the debut album started.\n\nIn 2002, the band signed to [[Drakkar Records]] and was joined by current lead guitarist Philip Restemeier. As work on the debut album progressed, the band started playing shows in and around Bielefeld. In the winter of 2002, the band entered the studio to record their debut album ''[[Kill the Sun]]''. They released ''Kill the Sun'' in May 2003, and it reached No. 98 on the German music charts.<ref name=ML>{{cite web |url=http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Xandria/?type=longplay |title=Xandria \u2014 Longplay-Chartverfolgung |language=German |work=musicline.de |publisher=Phononet GmbH |accessdate=5 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010132340/http://www.musicline.de/de/chartverfolgung_summary/artist/Xandria/?type=longplay |archive-date=10 October 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref> To promote the album, the band played a few shows with [[Schandmaul]] and [[Subway to Sally]]. Then they went on a three-week tour of Germany with [[Tanzwut]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xandria.de/?page_id=47|title=Biography|work=Xandria|accessdate=25 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nAfter playing some festivals in support of ''[[Kill the Sun]]'', the band started writing their second album. Recording of the album began in December 2003 at Pleasure Park Studios, with producer Jos\u00e9 Alvarez-Brill. Production on the album was finished in February 2004. Shortly after the recordings were completed, bassist Roland Krueger left the band and was replaced by Nils Middelhauve. ''[[Ravenheart]]'' was released on May 24, 2004, and it stayed on the charts for seven weeks, reaching No. 36.<ref name=ML/>\n\nIn 2005 they released their third album, ''[[India (Xandria album)|India]]'', which reached No. 30 on the German charts.<ref name=ML/> Xandria began recording their fourth album, ''[[Salom\u00e9 \u2013 The Seventh Veil]]'', on December 14, 2006.

The band found a new singer in February 2009, Kerstin Bischof a.k.a. Lakonia, best known for her collaborations with the band [[Axxis]]. However, after just one year Kerstin Bischof decided to leave the band to concentrate on a different career, and [[Lisa Middelhauve|Middelhauve]] replaced her for a series of concerts in Summer 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=135376 |title=Xandria once again looking for lead singer |date=18 February 2010 |work=[[Blabbermouth]] |accessdate=18 February 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063855/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=135376 |archivedate=6 June 2011 }}</ref> On December 19, 2010, Xandria announced the addition of 29-year-old female singer [[Manuela Kraller]] to the group's ranks.
