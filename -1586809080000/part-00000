Flow Attacks take the place of Normal Attacks from previous games, and in place of Charge Attacks are Trigger Attacks, which are performed by pressing the right trigger button and any face button.  Trigger attacks allows the player to stun an opponent, knock down an opponent, or send them airborne; each player also has a unique fourth reactive attack, known as a Special Attack, that has a longer cooldown before they may be used. Trigger Attacks may be followed up by a Flow Attack combo, which can, in turn, combo into another Trigger Attack.  Additionally, the player have access to a Reactive Attack, used whenever the player presses the right button when prompted to do so; this attack allows the player to charge into enemies, counter enemy attacks, or finish off weakened enemies. Musou Attacks return from previous games, and their mechanics are identical to ''Dynasty Warriors'' series games prior to ''Dynasty Warriors 6''. The player also have access to an airborne Musou Attack, which depletes only a small portion of the Musou gauge. New to ''Dynasty Warriors 9'' is the Stamina Gauge, a gauge that gradually replenishes until full. The stamina gauge is depleted upon double jumping, wall jumping, or in other selectable circumstances.\n\nCharacters will automatically draw their weapons when close to an enemy, or put away their weapons when they are no longer near them; however, the player may manually draw or withdraw their weapon by pressing on the left analog stick. Some actions, such as initiating conversations in towns and villages, may only be done when their weapons are not drawn. When a character does not have their weapon drawn, the player may also crouch and sneak behind groups of enemies.\n\nAll characters also have access to a bow, which they may access by pressing down on the directional pad. The player may acquire different types of ammunition over the course of the game, which may be selected by pressing left and right on the directional pad and fired by pressing the flow attack button.  These come into play when sneaking into enemies, hunting wildlife, or initiating specialized attacks.\n\nHorses return from previous games; the player may buy horses and ride them to level up their attributes.  While on a horse, the player may have the horse automatically take them to the next recommended destination by pressing the left trigger button, or make their horse sprint by pressing the right shoulder button. Like characters, horses have their own stamina gauge, which depletes when sprinting but replenishes when they are not.\n\nAll 83 characters from ''[[Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires]]'' returned. New characters also were introduced, one of whom made his first appearance in the spin-off ''[[Warriors All-Stars]]''.<ref name=\"FamInt\" /><ref name=\"Gematsu\" /> Other than playable characters, there are four [[non-playable character]]s (NPCs) who have unique designs but wield generic weapons common to other NPCs.<ref>{{cite web | author=Sato | url=http://www.siliconera.com/2018/01/26/dynasty-warriors-9-details-unique-npcs-xiahou-ji-dong-bai-hua-xiong-yuan-shu/ | title=Dynasty Warriors 9 Details Its Unique NPCs Xiahou Ji, Dong Bai, Hua Xiong, And Yuan Shu | work=[[Siliconera]] | date=January 26, 2018 | accessdate=January 28, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n=== Story mode ===\nStory Mode in ''Dynasty Warriors 9'' retells the story of ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'' in a series of 13 chapters, from the [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] to the [[Conquest of Shu by Wei|fall of Shu]] in the final chapter. Each playable character has a story set within a subset of these chapters, corresponding roughly to the time in history where they were historically relevant; no character has a story that spans the full 13 chapters, and some characters will have longer stories than others. Each character has their own individual ending, roughly corresponding to their historical death or the point in which they were no longer historically relevant.\n\nAt the start of the game, the player may only select the patriarchs of the three kingdoms: [[Liu Bei]], [[Cao Cao]], and [[Sun Jian]]; additional characters are unlocked for the most part by completing the first chapter a character is playable in with a different character. The progression of each character in their own story is kept separately, allowing the player to switch between different characters at any time. All characters share a common pool of acquired weapons, items, and map knowledge, but must be leveled separately.\n\n=== Free Mode ===\nFree Mode in ''Dynasty Warriors 9'', unlocked once the story of any character is complete, allows the player to play as any character in any chapter that has been previously completed by any character, without regard to historical context. The player may only have either a Story Mode save or a Free Mode save for a particular character; if a character has a Free Mode save, they must replay their Story Mode from the beginning if a new Story Mode game is started with that character.\n\n== Development ==\nIn an interview with ''[[Famitsu]]'' in May 2016, Omega Force brand manager [[Kenichi Ogasawara]] commented that \"the evolution from ''[[Dynasty Warriors 7]]'' to ''[[Dynasty Warriors 8|8]]'' was insufficient\", and hoped that the announcement of their next game in the series would \"have a great impact\".<ref>{{cite web | last=Ramsey | first=Robert | title=Dynasty Warriors 9 Announcement will 'Have a Greater Impact than You Can Imagine' | work=[[Push Square]] | date=May 18, 2016 | accessdate=December 18, 2016 | url=http://www.pushsquare.com/news/2016/05/dynasty_warriors_9_announcement_will_have_a_greater_impact_than_you_can_imagine}}</ref>\n\nThe game was revealed later in the year in December during a \"Greatest Games Lineup in History\" broadcast, with Sony Computer Entertainment Japan Asia (SCEJA) president Atsushi Morita introducing the title; Koei Tecmo's western branches followed and announced the game alongside Japan.

A ''Famitsu'' interview with Koei Tecmo's Masaki Furusawa and Akihiro Suzuki revealed that all 83 characters that appeared in ''Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires'' would appear in the game.

For the first time in the series, ''Dynasty Warriors 9'' featured an [[open world]] environment, allowing players to enter and exit towns and freely explore the map of mainland China with considerable differences in elevation. A ''Famitsu'' interview with Koei Tecmo's Masaki Furusawa and Akihiro Suzuki revealed that all 83 characters that appeared in ''Dynasty Warriors 8: Empires'' would appear in the game.

It is a [[seaside resort]] that saw a peak of tourists in the summer months between the 1950s and 1970s.\n\nThe town's economy continues to rely significantly on entertainment and day-trip facilities and it is strong in the service sector, with a large retired population. The north-west part of the town has two business/industrial parks. In the wider district, agriculture and occupations connected to the [[Harwich|Port of Harwich]] provide further employment. It lies within the [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|Clacton]] United Kingdom Parliament [[United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituency]].\n\n==Geography==\nIt is located between [[Jaywick]] and [[Holland-on-Sea]] along the coastline and [[Great Clacton]] to the north. The relevant local authority is Tendring District Council.\n\nIt is at the south-eastern end of the [[A133 road|A133]]. The resort of [[Frinton-on-Sea]] is nearby to the north-east.\n\n==Amenities==\n[[File:Town centre fountain, Clacton.JPG|thumb|Town centre fountain]]\nClacton has a pleasure pier, arcades, a golf course, caravan parks and an airfield. The town and its beaches are still popular with tourists in the summer and there is an annual entertainment programme including the Clacton Carnival, which starts on the second Saturday in August and lasts for a week. Clacton Airshow, an aerial display, takes place on the Thursday and Friday before the August Bank Holiday, with historic and modern aircraft such as the [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]], [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]], [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]], [[BAe Harrier|Harrier]], [[Sepecat Jaguar|Jaguar]], [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]], and [[helicopters]]. There are also [[wing walking|wing-walkers]] and the [[Red Arrows]].\n\nClacton has a shopping area with many of the usual national chains represented, and a Factory Shopping Village in the north of the town.\n\nClacton has two theatres, the [[West Cliff Theatre]] and the Princes Theatre. The West Cliff is one of the last theatres in the country to put on an old-style summer show.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Clacton Spear 02.jpg|thumb|right|Clacton Spear, [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London]]\nClacton was a site of the lower [[Palaeolithic]] [[Clactonian]] [[archaeological industry|industry]] of flint tool manufacture.<ref name=Laing50>{{cite book |last=Laing |first=Lloyd |last2=Laing |first2=Jennifer |date=1980 |title=The Origins of Britain  |publisher=Book Club Associates |pages=50\u201351 |isbn=0710004311}}</ref> The \"[[Clacton Spear]]\", a wooden ([[Taxus baccata|yew]]) spear found at Clacton in 1911 and dated at 450,000 years ago, is the oldest such spear to have been found in Britain.<ref name=Laing50 /><ref name=\"Clacton Spear\">{{cite web\n |title=The Clacton Spear \n |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] \n |url=http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 \n |accessdate=23 October 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028210420/http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 \n |archivedate=28 October 2014 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\nThere is plentiful archaeological evidence of scattered settlement in the area, including [[Beaker culture|Beaker Folk]] traces at Point Clear to the south and round houses (as cropmarks) near the A133 extension from Weeley to the north. There may have been a pre-Roman (i.e. Celtic) settlement at Gt. Clacton and there were almost certainly scattered farmsteads as the important British Celtic settlement at Colchester was only about {{convert|15|mile}} away.  No traces of substantial Roman settlement have been found at Clacton though there are several Roman villa sites nearby (e.g. Alresford, Wivenhoe, Brightlingsea). After the Anglo-Saxon migration and the foundation of the kingdom of Essex, a village called ''Claccingtun'' (\"the village of Clacc's or Clacca's people\") was established. No pre-Norman buildings survive today. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 records the village as ''Clachintuna''.\n\nClacton was repeatedly surveyed by the Army in the Napoleonic Wars as a possible invasion beach-head for Napoleon and his Dutch allies. There was a large army and militia camp where Holland-on-Sea now stands. In 1810 five [[Martello Towers]] were built to guard the beaches between Colne Point to the south and what is now Holland-on-Sea to the north of the town.\n\nIn 1871 the Essex railway engineer and land developer [[Peter Bruff]], the steamboat owner William Jackson, and a group of businessmen built a pier and the Royal Hotel (now converted to flats) on a stretch of farmland adjoining low gravelly cliffs and a firm sand-and-shingle beach near the villages of Great and Little Clacton. The town of Clacton-on-Sea was officially incorporated in 1872 and laid out rather haphazardly over the next few years: though it has a central 'grand' avenue (originally Electric Parade, now Pier Avenue) the street plan incorporates many previously rural lanes and tracks, such as Wash Lane. Plots and streets were sold off piecemeal to developers and speculators. In 1882 the [[Great Eastern Railway]] already serving the well-established resort of [[Walton-on-the-Naze]] along the coast, built a spur to Clacton-on-Sea with a junction at Thorpe-le-Soken.\n\nClacton grew into the largest seaside resort between [[Southend-on-Sea]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], with some 10,000 residents by 1914 and c.20,000 by 1939. Due to its accessibility from the East End of London and the Essex suburbs, Clacton, like Southend, remained predominantly geared to catering for working-class and lower-middle-class holidaymakers \u2013 though it had, and has, its more 'select' areas.\n\nFor well over a century Clacton Pier has been an [[RNLI]] lifeboat station.\n\nJust before the Second World War the building of [[Butlin's]] Holiday Camp boosted its economy, though the Army took it over between then and 1945 for use as an internment, engineer, pioneer and light anti-aircraft artillery training camp.\n\nFour notable incidents occurred in Clacton-on-Sea during World War II. First, very early in the war a German airman bailed out over the town. Procedures for dealing with enemy captives were not yet well-established and he was treated as a celebrity guest for some days, including by the town council, before eventually being handed over to the military {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}. Second, a [[Luftwaffe]] [[Heinkel]] 111 bomber crashed into the town on 30 April 1940, demolishing several houses in the Vista Road area as one of the magnetic mines on board exploded on impact, killing the crew and two civilians; another mine was defused by experts from the Navy. Third, the Wagstaff Corner area was bombed in May 1941, demolishing some well-known buildings. Finally, a [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rocket hit in front of the Tower Hotel, injuring dozens of troops inside though without bringing down the structure. Clacton lay beneath the route taken by many of the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and V2 bombs aimed at London.\n\nA big role in the town during the pre- and post-war period was played by the Kingsman family, which bought and developed the pier and ran a pleasure-steamer service from London. A summer sea excursion to [[Calais]] also ran until the early 1960s. Butlin's reopened the holiday camp after the war. This, along with the expansion of the nearby chalet town of Jaywick, originally a speculative private development of inter-war years, and increasingly capacious caravan sites, all swelled by the movement of retired Londoners into the area, altered the character of the town.{{when|date=June 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn 1964 the town was in the national news when rival gangs of Mods and Rockers fought on the sea front and several arrests were made. (In mid-60s youth culture, 'Mods' favoured scooters and wore parkas, while 'rockers' rode motorcycles and wore leather and denim. The incident became known locally as 'The Battle of Pier Gap' following a headline in the local paper, the East Essex Gazette). Throughout the 1960s Clacton beach remained a popular summer excursion for residents of Essex and east London and in August was often crammed to capacity in the area around the Pier. The [[pirate radio]] ship [[MV Galaxy]], which broadcast [[Wonderful Radio London]], was anchored offshore from 1964 until its forced closure in 1967.\n\nWith the advent of cheap flights to Mediterranean resorts in the 1970s, the holiday industry began to decline. Increasingly, hotels' and guest-houses' spare capacity came to be used as 'temporary' accommodation by the local authority to house those on welfare, refugees, migrants and asylum seekers. Pier Ward, in the centre of the town, is one of the poorest in the UK; (nearby Jaywick is often cited as the poorest of all). Since around 1970 several well-known local buildings have been demolished, including the palatial [[art deco]] [[Odeon Cinema]] (a great loss to both the town and the county); the Warwick Castle Pub; the Waverley Hotel; Barker House, a large home for the learning disabled, and Groom's Crippleage, which housed orphaned handicapped girls from London. Cordy's, a well-known large seafront restaurant has been converted to other uses. The site of Butlin's Holiday Camp was redeveloped as a housing estate. The once famously crowded bus station in Jackson Road has become a car park. The Ocean Revue Theatre, where [[Max Bygraves]] made one of his first appearances, has closed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jacobs|first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Jacobs |date=1967 |title=Clacton Past and Present|publisher=WO series (War Office), ADM 1 (Naval), HO 192/3 (Civil Defence) files at the National Archives}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Jacobs|first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Jacobs |date=1967 |title=The Essex Countryside|publisher=WO series (War Office), ADM 1 (Naval), HO 192/3 (Civil Defence) files at the National Archives}}</ref>\n\nThe town expanded substantially in the 1980s, 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, with new housing estates on the rural margins of town, and some brownfield developments. Many residents commute to work in [[Colchester]], [[Witham]], [[Chelmsford]] or [[London]]. Clacton was in the news when its town centre and seafront areas were struck by [[1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak|an F1/T2 tornado]] on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi|title=European Severe Weather Database|website=www.eswd.eu}}</ref> A large wind-farm, built in the early 2000s some 3 miles offshore on [[Gunfleet Sands]], is visible from many streets and from various places in the flat hinterland of the town. However, in common with many seaside towns, unemployment has remained stubbornly high in Clacton itself compared with much of southeast England.\n\n==Seaside resort==\n[[File:Clacton-on-Sea West-Beach.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|West Beach]]\n[[File:Garden of Remembrance, Clacton-on Sea2.jpg|thumb|Garden of Remembrance]]\nThe modern day Clacton-on-Sea was founded by [[Peter Bruff]] in 1871 as a seaside resort. Originally the main means of access was by sea; [[Steamships]] operated by the [[Woolwich Steam Packet Company]] docked from 1871 at [[Clacton Pier]] which opened the same year. The pier now offers an amusement arcade and many other forms of entertainment.\n\nPeople who wanted to come by road had to go through Great Clacton. In the 1920s, London Road was built to cope with the influx of holidaymakers. Later, in the 1970s, the eastern section of the A120 was opened obviating the need for Clacton visitors to go through Colchester. Today [[PS Waverley|Paddle Steamer ''Waverley'']] operates from Clacton Pier offering pleasure boat excursions.\n\nClacton has a [[Blue Flag beach]] at Martello Bay (two more are locally at [[Dovercourt]] Bay & [[Brightlingsea]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Blue Flag beaches in the UK |url=https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/travel/blue-flag-beaches-uk-full-list-england-wales-scotland-northern-ireland-how-explained/ |website=inews |accessdate=4 September 2019}}</ref> Clacton Seafront Gardens which run along the top of the seafront west of Clacton Pier has also been awarded a Green Flag and includes various sections with formal gardens, memorials and places to sit.\n\n===Former Butlins===\n{{main|Clacton (holiday camp)}}\nIn 1936, [[Billy Butlin]] bought and refurbished the West Clacton Estate, an amusement park to the west of the town. He opened a new amusement park on the site in 1937 and then, a year later on 11 June 1938, opened the second of his holiday camps. This location remained open until 1983 when, due to changing holiday tastes, Butlins decided to close the facility. It was then purchased by former managers of the camp who reopened it as a short-lived theme park, called Atlas Park. The land was then sold and redeveloped with housing.<ref name=\"EL0608\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?referral=other&pnum=&refresh=3Ex0Hy14j5C1&EID=52357006-6cf2-46b7-874f-a85febe6a2c6&skip=true|title=Morning campers|last=Adams|first=Nicky|date=June 2008|work=Essex Life|publisher=Archant|pages=18\u201320|accessdate=5 February 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725170452/http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?referral=other&pnum=&refresh=3Ex0Hy14j5C1&EID=52357006-6cf2-46b7-874f-a85febe6a2c6&skip=true|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=dmy-all}} (Registration required.)</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nClacton has a cricket club and a football team called [[F.C. Clacton]], whose best [[F.A. Cup]] performance was the 1st round. The football team play at the Austin Arena with the bus shelter being the stand for the passionate supporters.  The name was derived after someone said it looked like a bus shelter. The club then took bus timetables and stuck them on it, to resemble a bus shelter.\n\nThe Cricket Club has many grounds around Clacton with one in Holland-on-sea and another where [[Essex County Cricket Club]] used to play. Clacton also have a rugby club with teams ranging from under 12s to a first and second team. The first and second teams play in Essex League 1 and train on a Tuesday night at 7 which is held at the rugby club in Valley Road.\n\n== Industry ==\nPrior to the foundation of Clacton-on-Sea the chief occupations in the area were farming and small-scale fishing. A steam-powered mill was built in 1867 to replace the local windmill, which was eventually demolished in 1918. Today the town's main industrial area is in the northeast of the town (Gorse Lane Industrial Estate and Oakwood Business Park) which contain a variety of businesses and light industrial units.\n\nClacton Urban District Council had provided the town with electricity since the early twentieth century from Clacton power station. Upon [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership passed to the [[British Electricity Authority]] and later to the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]]. Electricity connections to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|national grid]] rendered the small 2.15 [[Watt|megawatt]] (MW) internal combustion engine power station redundant. It closed in 1966; in its final year of operation it delivered 796 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity to the town.<ref>''CEGB Statistical Yearbook 1966'', CEGB, London.</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n\nClacton has comparatively few buildings of architectural interest. In addition to the surviving large seafront hotels there are:\n\n===St John's Church, Gt Clacton===\nThe parish church of St John, Gt. Clacton, is the oldest surviving building in the urban district, dating from the early decades of the 12th century, though considerably altered. A local legend that smugglers used a tunnel from the coast to the Ship Inn (16th century) opposite the church is discounted by historians. The pub is more than 1.5&nbsp;km from the sea. The nearby Queens Head inn may be pre-1600.\n\n===St James's Church===\nA large (and actually unfinished) church of 1912-13 between Tower Road and Wash Lane, St James's is a rare southern building by [[Temple Moore]], an architect chiefly associated with the North of England. Somewhat grim on the outside (as [[Pevsner]] noted in ''The Buildings of Essex''), the interior is surprisingly light and spare, with different orders of arch on either side of the chancel giving an asymmetrical feel. The building is only a third of its intended size, and the original plans included a large tower at the West end. Ordered for anglo-catholic worship, it is large, without pews and boasts an impressive reredos which finishes in a canopy at the East end.\n\n===Clacton Rail Station===\nThe main station building dates from 1929. A typical neo-Georgian 'late Imperial'-style building, it is notable chiefly for the decorative use of moulded '[[fasces]]' on either side of the main entrance - a rare instance of [[Fascist]] symbolism in British civic architecture.\n\n===Clacton Town Hall===\nIn Station Road. Another Late Imperial, neo-Georgian building, with a tall and portentous portico of Composite columns flanked by rather feeble-looking single-story wings. It also houses the Princes Theatre. The architect was Sir A. Brumwell Thomas.\n\n===Martello Towers===\nThere are three of these between the Pier and Jaywick Sands to the south. They date from 1809-12. The immensely thick brick walls look circular, but are in fact rounded triangles, designed to deflect cannon-fire. The tower nearest the Pier was, unusually, built within a moat. The name comes from similar fortifications in Mortella, Corsica.\n\n===Moot Hall===\nA real oddity: in Albany Gardens West, near the seafront to the north of the Pier, this house of the 1400s was moved from the village of [[Hawstead, Suffolk]] and reconstructed here in 1911 \u2013 though considerably modernised and altered \u2013 for a London builder named J H Gill.\n\n===St Helena Hospice===\nIn Jackson Road, in the town centre. Clacton's best modern building, an elegantly curved wood and brick corner design of 2001-2 by the Purcell Miller Tritton architectural partnership.\n\n===Jaywick Sands===\n{{Main|Jaywick}}\nOriginally (1920s and '30s) a huddle of self-builds and kit-houses in a bleak field dangerously close to mean sea level, and in places still little more than a shanty town, Jaywick nevertheless has its admirers as 'folk-architecture'. It was badly damaged by the [[North Sea flood of 1953|floods of 1953]], when almost 50 residents died.

This makes for pleasantly warm and relatively dry summers (which also enhances the towns popularity as a sea-side town), but also fairly chilly winter days. For the 1961\u20131990 observation period, Clacton averaged 103.7 days with at least 1mm of rain annually, and just 24.3 air frosts a year- comparable to south west coastal locations.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Clacton 1961\u20131990, 16&nbsp;m asl.\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 6.1\n|Feb high C = 6.3\n|Mar high C = 8.6\n|Apr high C = 11.0\n|May high C = 14.8\n|Jun high C = 18.2\n|Jul high C = 20.3\n|Aug high C = 20.3\n|Sep high C = 18.1\n|Oct high C = 14.5\n|Nov high C = 9.7\n|Dec high C = 7.2\n|year high C = 14.5\n|Jan low C = 1.8\n|Feb low C = 1.9\n|Mar low C = 3.1\n|Apr low C = 4.9\n|May low C = 8.3\n|Jun low C = 11.2\n|Jul low C = 13.3\n|Aug low C = 13.5\n|Sep low C = 11.7\n|Oct low C = 9.3\n|Nov low C = 5.0\n|Dec low C = 2.8\n|year low C = 7.2\n|Jan precipitation mm = 49\n|Feb precipitation mm = 31\n|Mar precipitation mm = 43\n|Apr precipitation mm = 40\n|May precipitation mm = 40\n|Jun precipitation mm = 45\n|Jul precipitation mm = 43\n|Aug precipitation mm = 43\n|Sep precipitation mm = 48\n|Oct precipitation mm = 48\n|Nov precipitation mm = 55\n|Dec precipitation mm = 50\n|year precipitation mm = 535\n|Jan sun = 58.3\n|Feb sun = 75.6\n|Mar sun = 117.6\n|Apr sun = 155.9\n|May sun = 207.8\n|Jun sun = 211.9\n|Jul sun = 200.1\n|Aug sun = 199.3\n|Sep sun = 153.4\n|Oct sun = 117.9\n|Nov sun = 75.0\n|Dec sun = 54.2\n|year sun = 1627.0\n|source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web\n| url =http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/sites/39.html | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20010210224457/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/sites/39.html | archivedate =10 February 2001 | title = Clacton 1961\u201390 averages | accessdate = 16 September 2011 | publisher = [[Met Office]]}}</ref>\n|date=September 2011\n}}\n\n==Demography==\nClacton's population increased substantially during the 20th century from 7,456 at the 1901 census to 25,000 in the 1960s, 45,065 in 1991 and reaching over 53,000 by 2001.\nPopulation as 107,237 according to Dataloft Inform, Land Registry, 2011 Census\n\n==Education==\nSt Osyth's Teacher Training College occupied several buildings in Clacton, mostly along Marine Parade East, until its amalgamation with the North East Essex Technical College in the late 1970s. The town is served by three secondary schools, [[Clacton Coastal Academy]], [[Clacton County High School]] and [[Tendring Enterprise Studio School]]. The [[Colchester Institute]] has a site on Church Road and Thomas Road.  Adult Community Learning, run by Essex County Council, is situated in St Osyth Road.there are also multiple junior schools like Alton Park with all most 500 kids that have in rolled which spans to year 3 to 6.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Weeley By-pass (Mk 2) - geograph.org.uk - 124855.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Weeley]] A133 bypass]]\n\nClacton-on-Sea is located at the terminus of the A133 road which runs between Clacton and Colchester.\n\nThe town is served by [[Clacton-on-Sea railway station]] (90 minutes to London Liverpool Street station) via the [[Sunshine Coast Line]] whose two branches (the other runs from [[Walton-on-the-Naze railway station|Walton-on-the-Naze]]) converge before [[Thorpe-le-Soken railway station|Thorpe-le-Soken]].\n\nThe town is served by bus routes operated by [[Hedingham Omnibuses]]. Termini include [[Colchester]], [[Manningtree]], [[Harwich]] and [[Walton-on-the-Naze]]. [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] operates coach services to/from London and Liverpool. First Essex withdrew from serving Clacton in January 2020. Hedingham Omnibus are now the only operator serving Clacton from Colchester.\n\nClacton also has [[Clacton Airport]], which has been active since its use by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] during the [[Second World War]]. In the 1990s, the airfield was featured in the BBC television series \"[[Airport (TV series)|Airport]]\".\n\n==Conservation==\nClacton's environmental qualities draw on several things: proximity to the sea, its evolution as the resort, its attraction as a retirement area, and its business and trade. The conservation and enhancement of Clacton's various environmental qualities depends on assessment, evaluation and management.\n\nBoth Tendring District Council and Essex County Council can advise on heritage and historic buildings. The district also advises on wildlife conservation, and on obtaining grants for managing countryside for public enjoyment and appreciation. The county has an archaeological service.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:George Wylie Hutchinson - self portrait.png|140px|thumb|George Wylie Hutchinson, self portrait, 1920]]\n[[File:Interpol - Rock am Ring 2015-9006.jpg|140px|thumb|Paul Banks, 2015]]\nThe following were all born or have lived in Clacton-on-Sea:\n* [[George Wylie Hutchinson]] (1852\u20131942) a Canadian painter and leading illustrator, lived in Clacton in retirement\n* [[Arthur Townsend (athlete)|Arthur Townsend]] (1883-??) a British long-distance runner, competed in the marathon at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]\n* Flight Lieutenant [[Edward Pennell]] DFC (1894\u20131974) a British WWI flying ace and local politician\n* [[Joan Kiddell-Monroe]] (1908\u20131972) a British author and illustrator of children's books\n* [[Pat Fletcher]] (1916\u20131985) golfer, born in Clacton-on-Sea and emigrated to Canada\n* [[Jennifer Worth]] RN RM (1935\u20132011) a British nurse and musician<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Jennifer Worth|last=|first=|date=9 July 2011|work=[[The Times]]|access-date=|issue=70307|page=84}}</ref>\n* [[Mike Everitt (footballer)|Mike Everitt]] (born 1941) an English former footballer and manager, over 300 pro games\n* [[Graham Hurley]] (born 1946) an English crime fiction writer\n* [[Steve Foley (footballer, born 1953)|Steve Foley]] an English former professional footballer, made 283 appearances for Colchester United\n* [[Stephen D.

It is a [[seaside resort]] that saw a peak of tourists in the summer months between the 1950s and 1970s.\n\nThe town's economy continues to rely significantly on entertainment and day-trip facilities and it is strong in the service sector, with a large retired population. The north-west part of the town has two business/industrial parks. In the wider district, agriculture and occupations connected to the [[Harwich|Port of Harwich]] provide further employment. It lies within the [[Clacton (UK Parliament constituency)|Clacton]] United Kingdom Parliament [[United Kingdom Parliament constituencies|constituency]].\n\n==Geography==\nIt is located between [[Jaywick]] and [[Holland-on-Sea]] along the coastline and [[Great Clacton]] to the north. The relevant local authority is Tendring District Council.\n\nIt is at the south-eastern end of the [[A133 road|A133]]. The resort of [[Frinton-on-Sea]] is nearby to the north-east.\n\n==Amenities==\n[[File:Town centre fountain, Clacton.JPG|thumb|Town centre fountain]]\nClacton has a pleasure pier, arcades, a golf course, caravan parks and an airfield. The town and its beaches are still popular with tourists in the summer and there is an annual entertainment programme including the Clacton Carnival, which starts on the second Saturday in August and lasts for a week. Clacton Airshow, an aerial display, takes place on the Thursday and Friday before the August Bank Holiday, with historic and modern aircraft such as the [[Avro Lancaster|Lancaster]], [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]], [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]], [[BAe Harrier|Harrier]], [[Sepecat Jaguar|Jaguar]], [[Panavia Tornado|Tornado]], and [[helicopters]]. There are also [[wing walking|wing-walkers]] and the [[Red Arrows]].\n\nClacton has a shopping area with many of the usual national chains represented, and a Factory Shopping Village in the north of the town.\n\nClacton has two theatres, the [[West Cliff Theatre]] and the Princes Theatre. The West Cliff is one of the last theatres in the country to put on an old-style summer show.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}\n\n==History==\n[[File:Clacton Spear 02.jpg|thumb|right|Clacton Spear, [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]], London]]\nClacton was a site of the lower [[Palaeolithic]] [[Clactonian]] [[archaeological industry|industry]] of flint tool manufacture.<ref name=Laing50>{{cite book |last=Laing |first=Lloyd |last2=Laing |first2=Jennifer |date=1980 |title=The Origins of Britain  |publisher=Book Club Associates |pages=50\u201351 |isbn=0710004311}}</ref> The \"[[Clacton Spear]]\", a wooden ([[Taxus baccata|yew]]) spear found at Clacton in 1911 and dated at 450,000 years ago, is the oldest such spear to have been found in Britain.<ref name=Laing50 /><ref name=\"Clacton Spear\">{{cite web\n |title=The Clacton Spear \n |publisher=[[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] \n |url=http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 \n |accessdate=23 October 2012 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028210420/http://piclib.nhm.ac.uk/results.asp?image=001066 \n |archivedate=28 October 2014 \n |df=dmy \n}}</ref>\n\nThere is plentiful archaeological evidence of scattered settlement in the area, including [[Beaker culture|Beaker Folk]] traces at Point Clear to the south and round houses (as cropmarks) near the A133 extension from Weeley to the north. There may have been a pre-Roman (i.e. Celtic) settlement at Gt. Clacton and there were almost certainly scattered farmsteads as the important British Celtic settlement at Colchester was only about {{convert|15|mile}} away.  No traces of substantial Roman settlement have been found at Clacton though there are several Roman villa sites nearby (e.g. Alresford, Wivenhoe, Brightlingsea). After the Anglo-Saxon migration and the foundation of the kingdom of Essex, a village called ''Claccingtun'' (\"the village of Clacc's or Clacca's people\") was established. No pre-Norman buildings survive today. The [[Domesday Book]] of 1086 records the village as ''Clachintuna''.\n\nClacton was repeatedly surveyed by the Army in the Napoleonic Wars as a possible invasion beach-head for Napoleon and his Dutch allies. There was a large army and militia camp where Holland-on-Sea now stands. In 1810 five [[Martello Towers]] were built to guard the beaches between Colne Point to the south and what is now Holland-on-Sea to the north of the town.\n\nIn 1871 the Essex railway engineer and land developer [[Peter Bruff]], the steamboat owner William Jackson, and a group of businessmen built a pier and the Royal Hotel (now converted to flats) on a stretch of farmland adjoining low gravelly cliffs and a firm sand-and-shingle beach near the villages of Great and Little Clacton. The town of Clacton-on-Sea was officially incorporated in 1872 and laid out rather haphazardly over the next few years: though it has a central 'grand' avenue (originally Electric Parade, now Pier Avenue) the street plan incorporates many previously rural lanes and tracks, such as Wash Lane. Plots and streets were sold off piecemeal to developers and speculators. In 1882 the [[Great Eastern Railway]] already serving the well-established resort of [[Walton-on-the-Naze]] along the coast, built a spur to Clacton-on-Sea with a junction at Thorpe-le-Soken.\n\nClacton grew into the largest seaside resort between [[Southend-on-Sea]] and [[Great Yarmouth]], with some 10,000 residents by 1914 and c.20,000 by 1939. Due to its accessibility from the East End of London and the Essex suburbs, Clacton, like Southend, remained predominantly geared to catering for working-class and lower-middle-class holidaymakers \u2013 though it had, and has, its more 'select' areas.\n\nFor well over a century Clacton Pier has been an [[RNLI]] lifeboat station.\n\nJust before the Second World War the building of [[Butlin's]] Holiday Camp boosted its economy, though the Army took it over between then and 1945 for use as an internment, engineer, pioneer and light anti-aircraft artillery training camp.\n\nFour notable incidents occurred in Clacton-on-Sea during World War II. First, very early in the war a German airman bailed out over the town. Procedures for dealing with enemy captives were not yet well-established and he was treated as a celebrity guest for some days, including by the town council, before eventually being handed over to the military {{citation needed|date=December 2018}}. Second, a [[Luftwaffe]] [[Heinkel]] 111 bomber crashed into the town on 30 April 1940, demolishing several houses in the Vista Road area as one of the magnetic mines on board exploded on impact, killing the crew and two civilians; another mine was defused by experts from the Navy. Third, the Wagstaff Corner area was bombed in May 1941, demolishing some well-known buildings. Finally, a [[V-2 rocket|V2]] rocket hit in front of the Tower Hotel, injuring dozens of troops inside though without bringing down the structure. Clacton lay beneath the route taken by many of the [[V-1 flying bomb|V1]] and V2 bombs aimed at London.\n\nA big role in the town during the pre- and post-war period was played by the Kingsman family, which bought and developed the pier and ran a pleasure-steamer service from London. A summer sea excursion to [[Calais]] also ran until the early 1960s. Butlin's reopened the holiday camp after the war. This, along with the expansion of the nearby chalet town of Jaywick, originally a speculative private development of inter-war years, and increasingly capacious caravan sites, all swelled by the movement of retired Londoners into the area, altered the character of the town.{{when|date=June 2019}}{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\nIn 1964 the town was in the national news when rival gangs of Mods and Rockers fought on the sea front and several arrests were made. (In mid-60s youth culture, 'Mods' favoured scooters and wore parkas, while 'rockers' rode motorcycles and wore leather and denim. The incident became known locally as 'The Battle of Pier Gap' following a headline in the local paper, the East Essex Gazette). Throughout the 1960s Clacton beach remained a popular summer excursion for residents of Essex and east London and in August was often crammed to capacity in the area around the Pier. The [[pirate radio]] ship [[MV Galaxy]], which broadcast [[Wonderful Radio London]], was anchored offshore from 1964 until its forced closure in 1967.\n\nWith the advent of cheap flights to Mediterranean resorts in the 1970s, the holiday industry began to decline. Increasingly, hotels' and guest-houses' spare capacity came to be used as 'temporary' accommodation by the local authority to house those on welfare, refugees, migrants and asylum seekers. Pier Ward, in the centre of the town, is one of the poorest in the UK; (nearby Jaywick is often cited as the poorest of all). Since around 1970 several well-known local buildings have been demolished, including the palatial [[art deco]] [[Odeon Cinema]] (a great loss to both the town and the county); the Warwick Castle Pub; the Waverley Hotel; Barker House, a large home for the learning disabled, and Groom's Crippleage, which housed orphaned handicapped girls from London. Cordy's, a well-known large seafront restaurant has been converted to other uses. The site of Butlin's Holiday Camp was redeveloped as a housing estate. The once famously crowded bus station in Jackson Road has become a car park. The Ocean Revue Theatre, where [[Max Bygraves]] made one of his first appearances, has closed.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jacobs|first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Jacobs |date=1967 |title=Clacton Past and Present|publisher=WO series (War Office), ADM 1 (Naval), HO 192/3 (Civil Defence) files at the National Archives}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Jacobs|first=Norman |authorlink=Norman Jacobs |date=1967 |title=The Essex Countryside|publisher=WO series (War Office), ADM 1 (Naval), HO 192/3 (Civil Defence) files at the National Archives}}</ref>\n\nThe town expanded substantially in the 1980s, 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, with new housing estates on the rural margins of town, and some brownfield developments. Many residents commute to work in [[Colchester]], [[Witham]], [[Chelmsford]] or [[London]]. Clacton was in the news when its town centre and seafront areas were struck by [[1981 United Kingdom tornado outbreak|an F1/T2 tornado]] on 23 November 1981, as part of the record-breaking nationwide tornado outbreak on that day.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.eswd.eu/cgi-bin/eswd.cgi|title=European Severe Weather Database|website=www.eswd.eu}}</ref> A large wind-farm, built in the early 2000s some 3 miles offshore on [[Gunfleet Sands]], is visible from many streets and from various places in the flat hinterland of the town. However, in common with many seaside towns, unemployment has remained stubbornly high in Clacton itself compared with much of southeast England.\n\n==Seaside resort==\n[[File:Clacton-on-Sea West-Beach.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|West Beach]]\n[[File:Garden of Remembrance, Clacton-on Sea2.jpg|thumb|Garden of Remembrance]]\nThe modern day Clacton-on-Sea was founded by [[Peter Bruff]] in 1871 as a seaside resort. Originally the main means of access was by sea; [[Steamships]] operated by the [[Woolwich Steam Packet Company]] docked from 1871 at [[Clacton Pier]] which opened the same year. The pier now offers an amusement arcade and many other forms of entertainment.\n\nPeople who wanted to come by road had to go through Great Clacton. In the 1920s, London Road was built to cope with the influx of holidaymakers. Later, in the 1970s, the eastern section of the A120 was opened obviating the need for Clacton visitors to go through Colchester. Today [[PS Waverley|Paddle Steamer ''Waverley'']] operates from Clacton Pier offering pleasure boat excursions.\n\nClacton has a [[Blue Flag beach]] at Martello Bay (two more are locally at [[Dovercourt]] Bay & [[Brightlingsea]]).<ref>{{cite web |title=Blue Flag beaches in the UK |url=https://inews.co.uk/inews-lifestyle/travel/blue-flag-beaches-uk-full-list-england-wales-scotland-northern-ireland-how-explained/ |website=inews |accessdate=4 September 2019}}</ref> Clacton Seafront Gardens which run along the top of the seafront west of Clacton Pier has also been awarded a Green Flag and includes various sections with formal gardens, memorials and places to sit.\n\n===Former Butlins===\n{{main|Clacton (holiday camp)}}\nIn 1936, [[Billy Butlin]] bought and refurbished the West Clacton Estate, an amusement park to the west of the town. He opened a new amusement park on the site in 1937 and then, a year later on 11 June 1938, opened the second of his holiday camps. This location remained open until 1983 when, due to changing holiday tastes, Butlins decided to close the facility. It was then purchased by former managers of the camp who reopened it as a short-lived theme park, called Atlas Park. The land was then sold and redeveloped with housing.<ref name=\"EL0608\">{{cite news|url=http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?referral=other&pnum=&refresh=3Ex0Hy14j5C1&EID=52357006-6cf2-46b7-874f-a85febe6a2c6&skip=true|title=Morning campers|last=Adams|first=Nicky|date=June 2008|work=Essex Life|publisher=Archant|pages=18\u201320|accessdate=5 February 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725170452/http://edition.pagesuite-professional.co.uk/Launch.aspx?referral=other&pnum=&refresh=3Ex0Hy14j5C1&EID=52357006-6cf2-46b7-874f-a85febe6a2c6&skip=true|archivedate=25 July 2011|df=dmy-all}} (Registration required.)</ref>\n\n==Sport==\nClacton has a cricket club and a football team called [[F.C. Clacton]], whose best [[F.A. Cup]] performance was the 1st round. The football team play at the Austin Arena with the bus shelter being the stand for the passionate supporters.  The name was derived after someone said it looked like a bus shelter. The club then took bus timetables and stuck them on it, to resemble a bus shelter.\n\nThe Cricket Club has many grounds around Clacton with one in Holland-on-sea and another where [[Essex County Cricket Club]] used to play. Clacton also have a rugby club with teams ranging from under 12s to a first and second team. The first and second teams play in Essex League 1 and train on a Tuesday night at 7 which is held at the rugby club in Valley Road.\n\n== Industry ==\nPrior to the foundation of Clacton-on-Sea the chief occupations in the area were farming and small-scale fishing. A steam-powered mill was built in 1867 to replace the local windmill, which was eventually demolished in 1918. Today the town's main industrial area is in the northeast of the town (Gorse Lane Industrial Estate and Oakwood Business Park) which contain a variety of businesses and light industrial units.\n\nClacton Urban District Council had provided the town with electricity since the early twentieth century from Clacton power station. Upon [[Nationalization|nationalisation]] of the electricity industry in 1948 ownership passed to the [[British Electricity Authority]] and later to the [[Central Electricity Generating Board]]. Electricity connections to the [[National Grid (Great Britain)|national grid]] rendered the small 2.15 [[Watt|megawatt]] (MW) internal combustion engine power station redundant. It closed in 1966; in its final year of operation it delivered 796 [[Kilowatt hour|MWh]] of electricity to the town.<ref>''CEGB Statistical Yearbook 1966'', CEGB, London.</ref>\n\n==Landmarks==\n\nClacton has comparatively few buildings of architectural interest. In addition to the surviving large seafront hotels there are:\n\n===St John's Church, Gt Clacton===\nThe parish church of St John, Gt. Clacton, is the oldest surviving building in the urban district, dating from the early decades of the 12th century, though considerably altered. A local legend that smugglers used a tunnel from the coast to the Ship Inn (16th century) opposite the church is discounted by historians. The pub is more than 1.5&nbsp;km from the sea. The nearby Queens Head inn may be pre-1600.\n\n===St James's Church===\nA large (and actually unfinished) church of 1912-13 between Tower Road and Wash Lane, St James's is a rare southern building by [[Temple Moore]], an architect chiefly associated with the North of England. Somewhat grim on the outside (as [[Pevsner]] noted in ''The Buildings of Essex''), the interior is surprisingly light and spare, with different orders of arch on either side of the chancel giving an asymmetrical feel. The building is only a third of its intended size, and the original plans included a large tower at the West end. Ordered for anglo-catholic worship, it is large, without pews and boasts an impressive reredos which finishes in a canopy at the East end.\n\n===Clacton Rail Station===\nThe main station building dates from 1929. A typical neo-Georgian 'late Imperial'-style building, it is notable chiefly for the decorative use of moulded '[[fasces]]' on either side of the main entrance - a rare instance of [[Fascist]] symbolism in British civic architecture.\n\n===Clacton Town Hall===\nIn Station Road. Another Late Imperial, neo-Georgian building, with a tall and portentous portico of Composite columns flanked by rather feeble-looking single-story wings. It also houses the Princes Theatre. The architect was Sir A. Brumwell Thomas.\n\n===Martello Towers===\nThere are three of these between the Pier and Jaywick Sands to the south. They date from 1809-12. The immensely thick brick walls look circular, but are in fact rounded triangles, designed to deflect cannon-fire. The tower nearest the Pier was, unusually, built within a moat. The name comes from similar fortifications in Mortella, Corsica.\n\n===Moot Hall===\nA real oddity: in Albany Gardens West, near the seafront to the north of the Pier, this house of the 1400s was moved from the village of [[Hawstead, Suffolk]] and reconstructed here in 1911 \u2013 though considerably modernised and altered \u2013 for a London builder named J H Gill.\n\n===St Helena Hospice===\nIn Jackson Road, in the town centre. Clacton's best modern building, an elegantly curved wood and brick corner design of 2001-2 by the Purcell Miller Tritton architectural partnership.\n\n===Jaywick Sands===\n{{Main|Jaywick}}\nOriginally (1920s and '30s) a huddle of self-builds and kit-houses in a bleak field dangerously close to mean sea level, and in places still little more than a shanty town, Jaywick nevertheless has its admirers as 'folk-architecture'. It was badly damaged by the [[North Sea flood of 1953|floods of 1953]], when almost 50 residents died. In recent years it has begun to acquire facilities which the developed world widely regards as indispensable, such as metalled roads, and a sewage system. The Martello Tower is used as an art space.\n\n===Clacton Pier===\n{{Main|Clacton Pier}}\n[[File:Clacton pier 700.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Clacton Pier viewed from the south west]]\n[[Clacton Pier]] was the first building of the new resort of Clacton-on-Sea.

This makes for pleasantly warm and relatively dry summers (which also enhances the towns popularity as a sea-side town), but also fairly chilly winter days. For the 1961\u20131990 observation period, Clacton averaged 103.7 days with at least 1mm of rain annually, and just 24.3 air frosts a year- comparable to south west coastal locations.\n\n{{Weather box|location = Clacton 1961\u20131990, 16&nbsp;m asl.\n|metric first = Yes\n|single line = Yes\n|Jan high C = 6.1\n|Feb high C = 6.3\n|Mar high C = 8.6\n|Apr high C = 11.0\n|May high C = 14.8\n|Jun high C = 18.2\n|Jul high C = 20.3\n|Aug high C = 20.3\n|Sep high C = 18.1\n|Oct high C = 14.5\n|Nov high C = 9.7\n|Dec high C = 7.2\n|year high C = 14.5\n|Jan low C = 1.8\n|Feb low C = 1.9\n|Mar low C = 3.1\n|Apr low C = 4.9\n|May low C = 8.3\n|Jun low C = 11.2\n|Jul low C = 13.3\n|Aug low C = 13.5\n|Sep low C = 11.7\n|Oct low C = 9.3\n|Nov low C = 5.0\n|Dec low C = 2.8\n|year low C = 7.2\n|Jan precipitation mm = 49\n|Feb precipitation mm = 31\n|Mar precipitation mm = 43\n|Apr precipitation mm = 40\n|May precipitation mm = 40\n|Jun precipitation mm = 45\n|Jul precipitation mm = 43\n|Aug precipitation mm = 43\n|Sep precipitation mm = 48\n|Oct precipitation mm = 48\n|Nov precipitation mm = 55\n|Dec precipitation mm = 50\n|year precipitation mm = 535\n|Jan sun = 58.3\n|Feb sun = 75.6\n|Mar sun = 117.6\n|Apr sun = 155.9\n|May sun = 207.8\n|Jun sun = 211.9\n|Jul sun = 200.1\n|Aug sun = 199.3\n|Sep sun = 153.4\n|Oct sun = 117.9\n|Nov sun = 75.0\n|Dec sun = 54.2\n|year sun = 1627.0\n|source 1 = [[Met Office]]<ref>{{cite web\n| url =http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/sites/39.html | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20010210224457/http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/climate/uk/averages/sites/39.html | archivedate =10 February 2001 | title = Clacton 1961\u201390 averages | accessdate = 16 September 2011 | publisher = [[Met Office]]}}</ref>\n|date=September 2011\n}}\n\n==Demography==\nClacton's population increased substantially during the 20th century from 7,456 at the 1901 census to 25,000 in the 1960s, 45,065 in 1991 and reaching over 53,000 by 2001.\nPopulation as 107,237 according to Dataloft Inform, Land Registry, 2011 Census\n\n==Education==\nSt Osyth's Teacher Training College occupied several buildings in Clacton, mostly along Marine Parade East, until its amalgamation with the North East Essex Technical College in the late 1970s. The town is served by three secondary schools, [[Clacton Coastal Academy]], [[Clacton County High School]] and [[Tendring Enterprise Studio School]]. The [[Colchester Institute]] has a site on Church Road and Thomas Road.  Adult Community Learning, run by Essex County Council, is situated in St Osyth Road.there are also multiple junior schools like Alton Park with all most 500 kids that have in rolled which spans to year 3 to 6.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Weeley By-pass (Mk 2) - geograph.org.uk - 124855.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Weeley]] A133 bypass]]\n\nClacton-on-Sea is located at the terminus of the A133 road which runs between Clacton and Colchester.\n\nThe town is served by [[Clacton-on-Sea railway station]] (90 minutes to London Liverpool Street station) via the [[Sunshine Coast Line]] whose two branches (the other runs from [[Walton-on-the-Naze railway station|Walton-on-the-Naze]]) converge before [[Thorpe-le-Soken railway station|Thorpe-le-Soken]].\n\nThe town is served by bus routes operated by [[Hedingham Omnibuses]]. Termini include [[Colchester]], [[Manningtree]], [[Harwich]] and [[Walton-on-the-Naze]]. [[National Express Coaches|National Express]] operates coach services to/from London and Liverpool. First Essex withdrew from serving Clacton in January 2020. Hedingham Omnibus are now the only operator serving Clacton from Colchester.\n\nClacton also has [[Clacton Airport]], which has been active since its use by the [[Royal Air Force|RAF]] during the [[Second World War]]. In the 1990s, the airfield was featured in the BBC television series \"[[Airport (TV series)|Airport]]\".\n\n==Conservation==\nClacton's environmental qualities draw on several things: proximity to the sea, its evolution as the resort, its attraction as a retirement area, and its business and trade. The conservation and enhancement of Clacton's various environmental qualities depends on assessment, evaluation and management.\n\nBoth Tendring District Council and Essex County Council can advise on heritage and historic buildings. The district also advises on wildlife conservation, and on obtaining grants for managing countryside for public enjoyment and appreciation. The county has an archaeological service.\n\n==Notable people==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:George Wylie Hutchinson - self portrait.png|140px|thumb|George Wylie Hutchinson, self portrait, 1920]]\n[[File:Interpol - Rock am Ring 2015-9006.jpg|140px|thumb|Paul Banks, 2015]]\nThe following were all born or have lived in Clacton-on-Sea:\n* [[George Wylie Hutchinson]] (1852\u20131942) a Canadian painter and leading illustrator, lived in Clacton in retirement\n* [[Arthur Townsend (athlete)|Arthur Townsend]] (1883-??) a British long-distance runner, competed in the marathon at the [[1912 Summer Olympics]]\n* Flight Lieutenant [[Edward Pennell]] DFC (1894\u20131974) a British WWI flying ace and local politician\n* [[Joan Kiddell-Monroe]] (1908\u20131972) a British author and illustrator of children's books\n* [[Pat Fletcher]] (1916\u20131985) golfer, born in Clacton-on-Sea and emigrated to Canada\n* [[Jennifer Worth]] RN RM (1935\u20132011) a British nurse and musician<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Jennifer Worth|last=|first=|date=9 July 2011|work=[[The Times]]|access-date=|issue=70307|page=84}}</ref>\n* [[Mike Everitt (footballer)|Mike Everitt]] (born 1941) an English former footballer and manager, over 300 pro games\n* [[Graham Hurley]] (born 1946) an English crime fiction writer\n* [[Steve Foley (footballer, born 1953)|Steve Foley]] an English former professional footballer, made 283 appearances for Colchester United\n* [[Stephen D.
