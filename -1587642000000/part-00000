{"title_page": "Robert Day (politician)", "text_new": "'''Robert Day'''  (1746-1841) was an Irish politician, [[barrister]] and judge, who was  a highly respected public figure throughout his very long life. Even [[Daniel O'Connell]], who thought him a poor lawyer and judge, had a great personal regard for him. <ref>Geoghegan p.63</ref>\n\n==Early life==\n\nHe was born in [[County Kerry]],  a younger son of the Reverend John Day of Lohercannon, Tralee, [[Chancellor (ecclesiastical)|Chancellor]]  of [[Ardfert Cathedral]], and his wife Lucy, daughter of [[Maurice FitzGerald, 14th Knight of Kerry]] and Elizabeth Crosbie.<ref>Ball p.229</ref>  The  Day family had come to Ireland, probably from [[East Anglia]],  in the seventeenth century.  Robert's grandfather Edward Day was a prosperous merchant: he married Ellen Quarry of [[Cork city]]. Among Robert's brothers and sisters was [[Edward Day (priest)|Edward Day]], [[Archdeacon of Ardfert]]. Robert and Edward were close all their lives, and Edward's death in 1808 was a great blow to Robert.<ref>O'Carroll ''Diary'' (2002) p.151</ref>  A third brother John was [[Lord Mayor of Cork]] in 1807. Robert went to school in  [[Tralee]]. He entered the [[University of Dublin]] 1n 1761, became a  Scholar in 1764 and graduated Bachelor of Arts in 1766.<ref>Ball p.229</ref>\n\nHe entered the [[Middle Temple]]  in 1769 and spent  several years in [[London]], in the company of his lifelong friend [[Henry Grattan]].<ref>Kenny  pp.180-1</ref> He was a lively young man and not apparently  much interested in learning the law,  preferring to see the sights of London, attend debates in the [[British House of Commons]]  and make frequent trips abroad.<ref>Day p.p.69</ref> He patronised the  celebrated [[Grecian Coffee House]] in [[Devereux Court]] off the [[ Strand, London|Strand]], where he is said to have enjoyed the friendship of  [[Oliver Goldsmith]]. Despite  his love of pleasure, his kindly nature is shown by his organising a  charitable subscription for the relief of a poor family found starving near the Temple.<ref>Kenny p,180</ref> His  obvious enjoyment of life came at a cost in his neglect of his legal studies-despite his rise to the top of  the legal  profession his ignorance of the law was proverbial.<ref>Geoghegan p.63</ref>\n\n==Bar and politics==\n\nHe returned to Ireland after five years in England  and settled into a more sedate way of life, having married  Mary (Polly)  Potts, daughter of Samuel Potts of London, in 1774.<ref>Ball p.229</ref> He was called to the [[Irish Bar]] the same year. He became [[King's Counsel]]  in 1790, and was a commissioner for revenue appeals and an advocate of the Irish Admiralty Court. Despite his early neglect of his legal studies  and his reputed ignorance of the criminal law he became Chairman of the Dublin [[Quarter Sessions]] in 1790.<ref>Ball p.229</ref> His success as a lawyer puzzled his  colleagues, who , though most of them liked him, had no regard for his  legal learning. Daniel O'Connell, a good friend, said that \"my poor friend Day is quite innocent of the law\", and [[John Philpot Curran]]  had a similarly low opinion of Day's legal ability.<ref>Geoghegan p.63</ref> \n\nHe entered politics, sitting in the [[Irish House of Commons]] as member for [[Tuam (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Tuam]] and later for [[Ardfert (Parliament of Ireland constituency)|Ardfert]]. He remained a close friend and political ally of Grattan and like him was a member of the popular drinking club called the [[Monks of the Screw]].<ref>Ball p.229</ref> He was a convinced supporter of [[ Catholic Emancipation]], and of other measures, such as the abolition of [[tithes]], and the discouragement  of absentee [[landlords]], which would benefit the Catholic peasantry. However he  supported the [[Act of Union 1800]], which delayed Emancipation for a generation, something he is said to have regretted in later life.<ref>\"New book details life of famed judge\" ''The Kerryman'' 4/5/2005</ref> He retained \nconsiderable influence in Kerry politics even after he went on the Bench. In 1807 he effectively  sold  the Parliamentary borough of  [[Tralee (UK Parliament constituency)|Tralee]]  to the future [[Duke of Wellington]]. Wellington  later complained  about the expense involved.<ref>Longford p.168</ref>\n\n==Judge==\n\nHe was appointed a justice of the [[Court of King's Bench (Ireland)]] in 1798, and almost immediately was appointed to the Special Commission to deal with  the aftermath of the\n[[Irish Rebellion of 1798]].<ref>Ball p.229</ref> He was also the junior judge at the trial of the [[Sheares brothers]],  Henry and John, who  were \nhanged for their part in the Rebellion. He visited England in 1807, where he fell seriously ill, and was unable to perform his judicial duties for almost a year.  In 1814 he was one of the judges who sat at the trial of the publisher  John Magee for [[seditious libel]], where despite their close friendship he clashed bitterly with Daniel O'Connell, who was [[defence counsel]].<ref>Geoghegan pp. 134-5</ref> In 1816 he presided at the much publicised [[quo warranto]] case, ''Rex v. O'Grady'', an the celebrated trial for [[murder]] of the Kerry [[attorney at law|attorney]], Rowan Cashel.  As a judge he was praised for integrity but not ability. Daniel O'Connell said that one could always win a case in front of Day by insisting on making the closing argument, since Day, by his own admission, generally agreed with whoever spoke last (as Geoghegan remarks,  many barristers still employ this tactic).<ref>Geoghegan p.63</ref> During the [[Napoleonic Wars]]  he became preoccupied with the danger of [[revolution]] and his addresses to [[grand juries]]  often consisted of a political harangue on the evils of sedition. J.P Kenyon notes that in England it was a long-standing tradition for the [[justice of the peace]] to address a grand jury in a similar fashion.<ref>''The Stuart Constitution'' 2nd Edition Cambridge University Press 1986 p.443, quoting the address by Sir [[Peter Leycester]] to a Cheshire grand jury in 1677 </ref>\n\nHis personal friendship with O'Connell even survived O'Connell's fatal [[duel ]]with John D'Esterre in January 1815. When Dublin was rife with news of the impending duel, Day was sent to arrest O'Connell, with the aim of preventing it. O'Connell insisted that he was not the aggressor, and Day, seemingly satisfied, merely [[binding over|bound him over]] to keep the peace, this making the duel inevitable. \"Was there ever such a scene?\" O'Connell asked later.<ref>Geoghegan p.150</ref>\n\nHe retired from the Bench in  1818. He lived at [[Merrion Square]] in Dublin city, at [[Loughlinstown]]  House in  south County Dublin,  and at Day Place, Tralee.<ref>Ball p.229</ref> He kept  an  interesting diary  for many years. An extract  covering the years 1808-1813 was  published in 2002, and the full diaries, together with his [[grand jury ]]addresses,  were published in 2004.\n\n==Marriages and children==\n\nHe died in at  Loughlinstown  House in  1841, aged almost ninety-five. By his  first wife Mary (Polly), who died in 1823,   he had a   daughter Elizabeth who married [[Sir Edward Denny, 3rd Baronet]], and had six children including [[Sir Edward Denny, 4th Baronet]].<ref>Ball p.229</ref> Although Day's first marriage was happy, there is no doubt   that he had two sons, John and Edward, by Mary Fitzgerald,  daughter of Bartholomew Fitzgerald of [[Bandon, County Cork ]], who became his second wife in 1824. The boys were born  in the late 1790s during his first wife's lifetime.<ref>Day  ''Killarney Sketches'' p.3</ref> He made provision for both sons   in  his will, and they adopted the surname Day. Mary, who was a [[Roman Catholic]], had lived with the family for many years as companion and later nurse to Polly.<ref>\"New book details life of famed judge\" ''The Kerryman'' 4/5/2005</ref> She died in 1849.<ref>Day, ''Killarney Sketches<''</ref> John, their elder son, followed the family traddition of entering the Church. He inherited from the senior branch of the family their  property at [[Beaufort, County Kerry]]. He was the grandfather of [[Charles Towry-Law, 4th Baron Ellenborough]].\n\n==Character==\n\nBall, writing in the mid 1920s,  describes Robert as a man who was estimable in every way.<ref>Ball p181</ref>  Whether Ball was aware of his unconventional domestic life is unclear (the first public references  to his affair with Mary Fitzgerald seem to be in the 1938 memoir by Ella Day, who married  a descendant of the judge).  Nonetheless there is ample evidence of his kindly and charitable nature, and  of his great gift for friendship.  Kenny adds that the descriptions we have  his pleasure-filled youth in London gives an attractive picture of a lively and fun-loving young man.<ref>Kenny pp.180-1</ref>\n\n==Sources==\n*Ball, F.

He was the son of King [[Bimbisara]] and was a contemporary of both [[Mahavira]] (Nigantha Nataputta) and [[Gautama Buddha]]. He forcefully took over the kingdom of Magadha from his father and imprisoned him.  He fought a war against [[Vajji]], ruled by the [[Licchavi (clan)|Lichchhavis]], and conquered the republic of [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vesali]].\n\nAjatashatru followed policies of conquest and expansion. He defeated his neighbours including the king of [[Kosala]]; his brothers, when at odds with him, went to Kashi, which had been given to Bimbisara as dowry. This led to a war between Magadha and Kosala. Ajatashatru occupied Kashi and captured the smaller kingdoms. Magadha under Ajatashatru became the most powerful kingdom in North India.\n\nHe is the inventor of two weapons used in war called ''rathamusala'' (Scythed chariot) and ''mahshilakantaka'' (engine for ejecting big stones).\n\n==Datings==\nBased on correlation with dates in the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' and concluding that the Buddha died in 483 BC, [[A. L. Basham]] dated the accession of Ajatashatru to 491 BC.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=75}} He estimates the first campaign of Ajatashatru to have taken place in 485 BC, and his second campaign against [[Vajji]]s in 481\u2013480 BC.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=75}} The ''[[Samannaphala Sutta]]'' states that Ajatashatru visited the six teachers to hear their doctrines and at last visited Buddha, an event Basham estimated to have taken place in 491 BC.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=79}}\n\n== Birth ==\n[[File:Hutchinsonsstory00londuoft 0169.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting Ajatashatru visiting the Buddha to assuage his guilt]]\nAjatashatru, also known as ''Kunika'', was the son of [[Bimbisara]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=36}} The ancient inscription in [[Government Museum, Mathura]] refers to him as ''vaidehi putra Ajatashatru Kunika'' \"Ajatashatru Kunika, the son of Vaidehi.\"  The story of Ajatashatru is found in the ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka]]'' of Buddhism and [[Jain Agamas (\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara)|Jain Agamas]].  The account of Ajatashatru's birth is more or less similar in both the traditions. According to [[Jainism]], Ajatashatru was born to King Bimbisara and Queen Chelna; Buddhist tradition records Ajatashatru being born to Bimbisara and [[Kosala Devi]].  It is worthwhile to note that both the queens were called \"Vaidehi\" in both the traditions.\n\nAccording to the Jain ''Nirayavalika Sutra'', during her pregnancy Queen Chelna had strong desire to eat fried flesh of her husband's heart and drink liquor. Meanwhile, the very intelligent Prince Abhayakumara, son of King Bimbisara and Queen Nanda, fried a wild fruit that resembled a heart and gave it to the queen. The queen ate it and later felt ashamed for having such a demonic desire and she feared that the child might grow up and prove fatal for the family, thus after a few months of the child being born, the queen had him thrown out of the palace. When the child was lying near the garbage dump, a cock bit his little finger. King Bimbisara, learning about the child being thrown out, ran outside and picked up the child and put its bleeding little finger in his mouth and sucked it until it stopped bleeding and continued this for days until it was healed. As the little finger of the child was sore, he was nicknamed ''Kunika'' \"Sore Finger\". Later he was named ''Asokacanda''.<ref>Jain Aagam Uvavai Sutra chapter: Kunika</ref>\n\nIn the Buddhist ''[[Atthakatha]]'', the above story is almost the same, except that Kosaladevi desired to drink blood from Bimbisara's arm; the king obliged her and, later, when the child was thrown near the garbage dump, due to an infection he got a boil on his little finger and the king sucked it and once while sucking it the boil burst inside the king's mouth, but due to affection for his child he did not spit the pus out, rather swallowed it.\n\n== Death of his father ==\n=== The Jaina tradition ===\nOnce Ajatashatru was eating his meal with his newborn son in his lap, his son suddenly urinated, of which some drops fell onto his plate but due to affection for his child he did not change the plate but wiped the drops with his own patta (cloth on the shoulder) and continued to eat from the same plate. After eating a morsel he asked his mother Chellana, who was sitting in the same dining room, whether she had ever seen a father as loving and caring as he was, to which his mother narrated the story of King Bimbisara sucking Ajatshatru's little finger. This touched his heart and his affection for his father was aroused. At once he picked up an axe and hurried to the prison to free his father by breaking all the iron chains himself. But when Bimbisara saw him coming with an axe in his hand he thought, '' ... so, he is coming to kill me. It is better that I end my life with my own hands.''  At once he removed the ''Talaputa'' poison from his ring, closed his eyes and chanted ''\"Kevli pannato Dhammam saranam pavajyami\"'' (I seek refuge in the dharma taught by the kevlins or omniscient) and swallowed the poison and ended his life.\n\nAjatashatru repented a lot but it was of no use. Ajatashatru then moved his palace to ''Champa'' and made it his capital as the previous palace reminded him of his atrocious mistake.\n\n=== The Buddhist tradition ===\nThere are different versions existing in Buddhist texts on the death of King Bimbisara.\n\nIn one version, Ajatashatru allowed no one but Kosala Devi to meet Bimbisara in the smokey cell. Ajatashatru wanted to starve him to death, as Devadatta had said: \"father cannot be killed by a weapon.\" Thus Kosala Devi used to take small food packets to the cell, being caught by guards she started to take food hidden behind her hair, being caught again she started slipping in food by hiding it in her golden slippers again being caught she coated 4 layers of honey on her body which was licked by the king.  When she was caught once again Ajatashatru prohibited Kosala Devi from meeting the king. When Ajatashatru saw that the king was not dying even then he ordered a barber to pierce the king's legs with a knife, then pour salt, hot oil and fire made from ''khaira'' wood on him. When this was done the king died.\n\nIn an alternate version, Ajatashatru had King Bimbisara imprisoned and tried to starve him to death. Kosala Devi took food to King Bimbisara, but was found out and stopped from visiting him any more. Bimbisara grew weak, but he derived comfort from looking at the mountain where the Buddha and his disciples resided. So Ajatashatru asked that his cell windows be covered so that King Bimbisara could not see the mountain. One day, the Buddha visited the city and Bimbisara could see him and his disciples through the holes in his door. Because Bimbisara saw Buddha and his disciples, he derived comfort and continued to live. After knowing this, Ajatashatru ordered that Bimbisara's feet be skinned. After this, King Bimbisara could not move, and so he lay in bed getting weaker.\n\nThen one day, King Ajatashatru was having meal with his mother, Kosala Devi. He had a son, who was playing with a puppy. Ajatashatru asked, 'Where are you now?' The prince answered: \"I am playing with the puppy.\" King Ajatashatru asked the prince to have meal together. The prince arrived, but did not want to eat. King Ajatashatru asked, 'Why do you not want to eat?' The prince said, 'If you let me have my meal together with my puppy, I will eat.' King Ajatashatru said, 'As you wish.' So the prince took his meal, and brought the meal for the puppy too.\n\nKing Ajatashatru told his mother,'I did a difficult thing. Why do I say that? I am a king, and because I love my son, I had my meal together with dogs.' The mother said, 'This is nothing difficult. Why do I say that? There are people who eat dog meat, so what is strange in giving food to dogs? Do you know that your father did difficult things?' Ajatashatru asked, 'What difficult things?' The mother said, 'When you were young, your finger was wounded. You could not sleep for nights because of the pain. Your father held you on his lap and sucked on your finger. Your father had a soft body, so you could sleep well. Because of the warmth of his mouth, your wound's pus broke out. Your father thought that if he spat out the pus, it would increase your pain, so he swallowed the pus. Your father did such difficult thing for you. Please release him.'\n\nAjatashatru stayed silent after hearing this. Kosala Devi thought that he had agreed to release his father, so the palace released this news. Everywhere in the city, people heard that Bimbisara was going to be released, so everyone was happy and went to jail saying. 'King Bimbisara is going to be released!' Bimbisara heard this and thought to himself,' My son is evil and has no compassion on me. I do not know what else he will do to hurt me.' After this thought, he killed himself in front of his bed.

She saw Halla and Vihalla kumaras with their wives sitting on ''Sechanaka'' elephant and one of the wives wearing the 18 fold divine necklace. Then she heard one of the maidservants speaking from the garden below \"It's Halla and Vihalla kumaras and not the king who enjoy the real pleasures of the kingdom\" and she thought \"what's the use of the kingdom if I do not have both the jewels in my possession?\"\n\nSo, she shared this thought with Ajatashatru the same night and became excessively insistent in her demand. Ajatashatru, at last, agreed and sent a request to both his brothers to give the elephant and the necklace to him, which both his brothers denied saying that these gifts were given by their dear father so why should they part from them? Ajatashatru sent the request thrice but got the same reply all three times. This greatly annoyed him, so he sent his men to arrest them. Meanwhile, Halla and the Vihalla kumaras availed a chance and escaped to their maternal grandfather ''Chetaka'' who was the king of the great kingdom of the Vaishali republic (Vajjis/[[Licchavi (clan)|Lichchavis]]). Ajatashatru sent notice thrice to Chetaka to surrender them but was denied by Chetaka.\n\nThis was enough for Ajatashatru.  He called his half brothers, Kalakumaras ''(10 kalakumaras, those born to King Bimbisara and 10 Kali Queens Kali, Sukali, Mahakali, etc.)'' to merge their army with his, since it was well known to Ajatashatru that Vaishali republic had always been invincible in the past and he alone would not be able to defeat it. Each Kalakumara brought 3000 horses, 3000 elephants, 3000 chariots and 30000 infantrymen each. On the other hand, Chetaka invited his own allies ''9 Mallas, 9 Lichhvis and 18 kings of Kasi-Kosala'' to fight his grandson Ajatashatru. All these kings came with 3000 horses, 3000 elephants, 3000 chariots and 30000 infantrymen each. Thus all together there were 57000 elephants, 57000 chariots, 57000 horses, and 570000 infantrymen.\n\nThe war began. King Chetaka was a devout follower of Lord [[Mahavira]] and had a vow to not shoot more than one arrow per day in a war. It was known to all that Chetaka's aim was perfect and his arrows were infallible. His first arrow killed one Kalakumara, commander of Ajatashatru. On the consecutive nine days the rest of the nine Kalakumaras were killed by Chetaka. Deeply sorrowed by the death of their sons, the Kali queens were initiated as nuns in the holy order of Lord Mahavira.\n\nAs Ajatashatru was moving towards defeat he practised penance for three days and offered prayers to Sakrendra and Charmendra ([[Indra]] of different heavens) who then helped him in the war. They protected him from the infallible arrow of Chetaka. The war became very severe and by the divine influence of the Indras even the pebbles, straws, leaves hurled by Ajatashatru's men were said to have fell like rocks on the army of Chetaka. This weapon was thus named ''\"'''Mahasilakantaka'''\"'', i.e. the weapon through which more than a lakh (1,00,000) people died. Next, the Indras granted a huge, automatically moving chariot with swinging spiked maces on each side, and said to have been driven by Charmendra himself, to Ajatashatru. The chariot moved about in the battlefield crushing lakhs of soldiers. This war-chariot was named ''Ratha-Musala''.\n\nIn this battle, Chetaka was defeated. But, Chetaka and others immediately took shelter inside the city walls of Vaishali and closed the main gate. The walls around Vaishali were so strong that Ajatashatru was unable to break through them. Many days passed, Ajatashatru became furious and again prayed to Indra, but this time Indra refused to help him. But Ajatashatru was informed by an oracle of a demi-goddess \"Vaishali can be conquered if ''Sramana (monk) Kulvalaka'' gets married to a courtesan.\"\n\nAjatashatru inquired about the monk Kulvalaka and sent for the prostitute ''Magadhika'' disguised as a devout follower. The fallen women attracted the monk towards herself and finally, the monk gave up his monkhood and married her. Later Magadhika on Ajatashatru's orders brainwashed Kulvalaka to enter Vaishali disguised as an astrologer. With great difficulty, he did enter Vaishali and learned that the city was saved by a ''Chaitya'' (altar) dedicated to ''[[Munisuvrata]]''. Kulvalaka then started telling people that this altar is the reason why the city is suffering through a bad period. The people uprooted the altar from its very foundation. Kulvalaka gave a signal and Ajatashatru proceeded as per prior arrangement. This was the last attack. Vaishali was conquered by Ajatashatru.\n\nSechanaka the elephant died after it fell in a pit with iron rods and fire made by Ajatashatru's soldiers. Later ''Halla and Vihalla kumaras'' got initiated as monks in the holy order of Lord Mahavira. Chetaka courted ''Sallekahna'' (fasted unto death).  Ajatashatru not only conquered Vaishali but also Kasi-Kosala. Manudev was a famous king of the illustrious [[Licchavi (clan)|Lichchavi clan]] of the confederacy, who desired to possess [[Amrapali]] after he saw her dance performance in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]].<ref>http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-31/books/31281015_1_amrapali-nagarvadhu-woman-warrior</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=September 2016}} After defeating the king, Ajatashatru was in a relationship with Amrapali.\n\n=== The Buddhist tradition ===\nThere was a diamond mine near a village on the river [[Ganges]]. There was an agreement between Ajatashatru and the [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]] of [[Vajji]] that they would have an equal share of the diamonds. Because of sheer lethargy, Ajatashatru failed to collect his own share, and the whole lot of diamonds was carried away by the Lichhavis. This happened many times, and at last, Ajatashatru got annoyed and thought, \"it is almost impossible to fight against the whole confederacy of Vaishali. I must uproot these powerful Vajjis and exterminate them\". He sent his chief minister Vassakara to Lord [[Buddha]] to ask him the purpose of Vaishali being invincible, to which Lord Buddha gave seven reasons which included Vajjis being punctual to the meetings, their disciplined behavior, their respect for elders, respect for women, they do not marry their daughters forcefully, they give spiritual protection to the [[Arhats]], and the main reason was the Chaityas (altar) inside the town.\n\nThus, with the help of his chief minister Vassakara, Ajatashatru managed to split the Vajjis and also broke the chaityas inside. Ajatashatru used a scythed chariot with swinging mace and blades on both the sides and attacked the town and conquered it.\n\n== Kingdom ==\n{{See also|Magadha|Maurya Empire}}\nAfter conquering Vaishali, Kasi and [[Kosala]] (Kaushala) Ajatashatru conquered 36 republican states surrounding his kingdom and firmly established the predominance of Magadha.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Ajatashatru was monarch of a huge kingdom, which covered almost all of modern India's [[Bihar]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Haryana]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Delhi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]],  One fourth of north [[Madhya Pradesh]], tip of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Jharkhand]], and [[west Bengal]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAjatashatru, with the help of his two ministers Sunidha and Vassak\u0101ra, built a fort near the banks of the river [[Ganges]] to strengthen the defense of Magadha and named it P\u0101tali Grama(village). Later it developed into a city, which soon became popular as [[Pataliputra]], now known as [[Patna]], the capital of [[Bihar]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nAccording to ''Mahaparinirvana sutta'', when Pataliputra was being erected, by chance the Buddha came there and praised the city of Pataliputra, and pointed to three things which could prove fatal to the city: fire, water, and discord among the people.\n\n== Family ==\n\n=== The Jaina tradition ===\n\nAccording to the ''Niray\u0101valiy\u0101 Sutt\u0101''  Ajatashatru was born to King Bimbisara and Queen Chellana, who was the daughter of ''Chetaka'' the king of Vaishali, who was the brother of ''Queen Tri\u015bal\u00e1'', mother of Mahavira. Ajatashatru had eight wives.\n\n=== The Buddhist tradition ===\nAccording to ''D\u012bgha nik\u0101ya,'' Ajatashatru was born to King Bimbisara and Queen [[Kosala Devi]], who was the daughter of ''Maha-Kosala'', the king of Kosala and sister of ''Pasenadi'' who later succeeded to the throne. Ajatashatru had 500 wives but the principal consort was [[Princess Vajira]].{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=271}} The City of Kasi was given to Bimbisara as dowry by Maha-Kosala. After the murder of Bimbisara, Prasenajit took the city back.  This resulted in a war between Ajatashatru and Prasenajit, in which Prasenajit was first defeated but became successful later. As Ajatashatru happened to be his nephew his life was spared.  In a peace treaty, Prasenajit married his daughter Vajira to him. Ajatashatru later had a son named ''Udayabhadda or Udayabhadra''.\n\n== Death ==\nThe account of Ajatashatru's death recorded by historians is {{circa|535 BCE}}.{{sfn|Thapar|1990|p=}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}} The account of his death differs widely between Jain and Buddhist traditions. Other accounts point towards {{circa|460 BCE}}<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IquM4BrJ4YC&pg=PT92&dq=ajatashatru#v=onepage&q=ajatashatru&f=false India: A History. Revised and Updated], by John Keay</ref> as the year of his death.\n\n=== The Jaina tradition ===\nAccording to the Jaina text, ''\u0100va\u015b\u0233aka Ch\u016brn\u012b,'' Ajatashatru went to meet Lord Mahavira. <br />\nAjatashatru asked,  \"Bhante! Where do [[Chakravartin]]s (world-monarchs) go after their death?\"<br />\nMahavira replied that \"A Chakravartin, if dying while in the office goes to the seventh hell called ''Mah\u0101-Tamahprabh\u0101'', and if dying as a monk attains [[Nirvana]].\"<br />\nAjatashatru asked, \"So will I Attain ''Nirvana'' or go to the seventh hell?\"<br />\nMahavira replied, \"Neither of them, you will go to the Sixth hell.\" <br />\nAjatashatru asked, \"Bhante, then am I not a Chakravartin?\",<br />\nto which Mahavira replied, \"No, you are not.\"\n\nThis made Ajatashatru anxious to become a world-monarch. He created 12 artificial jewels and set out for the conquest of the six regions of the world. But when he reached the ''Timisra Caves'' he was stopped by a guardian [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] called ''Krutam\u0101l'' who said, \"Only a Chakravartin can pass through this cave, there can be not more than 12 Chakravartin in the half cycle of a ''Kalchakra'', and already there have been 12.\"  On this, Ajatashatru said arrogantly, \"Then count me as the thirteenth and let me go or else my mace is strong enough to reach you to [[Yama]].\" The Deva became enraged at Ajatashatru's arrogance and by his power, he reduced him to ashes right on the spot. Ajatashatru was then reborn in the sixth hell called ''Tamahprabh\u0101''.\n\n=== The Buddhist tradition ===\nAjatashatru was brutally murdered by his own son, Udayabhadra, who was greedy of his kingdom. Ajatashatru was reborn in the hell called \"Lohakumbhiya\".\n\nAlthough the account of Ajatashatru's death differs in these traditions, both believe that after passing through many births Ajatashatru will be born as a wise prince, and later become a monk and attain Nirvana.\n\n== Religion ==\nAjatashatru is mentioned in both Jaina and Buddhist traditions.\n\nThe ''Uvavai/Aupap\u0101tika sutta,'' which is the first ''Up\u0101nga'' (see [[Jain Agamas (\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara)|Jain Agamas]]) of the Jains throws light on the relation between Mahavira and Ajatashatru. It accounts that Ajatashatru held Mahavira in the highest esteem. The same text also states that Ajatashatru had an officer to report to him about the daily routine of Mahavira. He was paid lavishly. The officer had a vast network and supporting field staff through whom he collected all the information about Mahavira and reported to the king. The ''Uvavai Sutta'' has detailed and illuminating discussion on Mahavira's arrival at the city of Champa, the honour was shown to him by Ajatashatru, the sermon given by Mahavira in [[Ardhamagadhi]] language, etc.\n\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, the ''[[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]]'' deals with his first meeting with the Buddha, where he realized his mistakes with his association to Devadatta and plan to killing his own father.  According to the same text, during this meeting, Ajatashatru took protection of the Buddha, the [[Dhamma]] and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].  He was mentioned more than once in several other Sutta as an example of strong devotee to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.  He erected a vast ''[[Stupa]]'' on the bones and ashes of the Buddha after the funeral, and Ajatashatru also was present in the first Buddhist council at the Sattapanni (Saptparni) caves [[Rajgriha]].\n\nWhether Ajatashatru was a Jain or Buddhist, both texts accounted for him as a devotee of the respective religions.\n\n== Depictions in popular culture ==\n* A fictionalised account of Ajatashatru&nbsp;\u2013 depicted as a physically gross and tyrannous figure&nbsp;, who delights in committing atrocities and massacres \u2013 appears in [[Gore Vidal]]'s novel ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]''.\n* A film about his life was released titled ''Ajatashatru''.

He was the son of King [[Bimbisara]] and was a contemporary of both [[Mahavira]] (Nigantha Nataputta) and [[Gautama Buddha]]. He forcefully took over the kingdom of Magadha from his father and imprisoned him.  He fought a war against [[Vajji]], ruled by the [[Licchavi (clan)|Lichchhavis]], and conquered the republic of [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vesali]].\n\nAjatashatru followed policies of conquest and expansion. He defeated his neighbours including the king of [[Kosala]]; his brothers, when at odds with him, went to Kashi, which had been given to Bimbisara as dowry. This led to a war between Magadha and Kosala. Ajatashatru occupied Kashi and captured the smaller kingdoms. Magadha under Ajatashatru became the most powerful kingdom in North India.\n\nHe is the inventor of two weapons used in war called ''rathamusala'' (Scythed chariot) and ''mahshilakantaka'' (engine for ejecting big stones).\n\n==Datings==\nBased on correlation with dates in the ''[[Mahavamsa]]'' and concluding that the Buddha died in 483 BC, [[A.

Basham]] dated the accession of Ajatashatru to 491 BC.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=75}} He estimates the first campaign of Ajatashatru to have taken place in 485 BC, and his second campaign against [[Vajji]]s in 481\u2013480 BC.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=75}} The ''[[Samannaphala Sutta]]'' states that Ajatashatru visited the six teachers to hear their doctrines and at last visited Buddha, an event Basham estimated to have taken place in 491 BC.{{sfn|Kailash Chand Jain|1991|p=79}}\n\n== Birth ==\n[[File:Hutchinsonsstory00londuoft 0169.jpg|thumb|Painting depicting Ajatashatru visiting the Buddha to assuage his guilt]]\nAjatashatru, also known as ''Kunika'', was the son of [[Bimbisara]].{{sfn|Dundas|2002|p=36}} The ancient inscription in [[Government Museum, Mathura]] refers to him as ''vaidehi putra Ajatashatru Kunika'' \"Ajatashatru Kunika, the son of Vaidehi.\"  The story of Ajatashatru is found in the ''[[Tripi\u1e6daka]]'' of Buddhism and [[Jain Agamas (\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara)|Jain Agamas]].  The account of Ajatashatru's birth is more or less similar in both the traditions. According to [[Jainism]], Ajatashatru was born to King Bimbisara and Queen Chelna; Buddhist tradition records Ajatashatru being born to Bimbisara and [[Kosala Devi]].  It is worthwhile to note that both the queens were called \"Vaidehi\" in both the traditions.\n\nAccording to the Jain ''Nirayavalika Sutra'', during her pregnancy Queen Chelna had strong desire to eat fried flesh of her husband's heart and drink liquor. Meanwhile, the very intelligent Prince Abhayakumara, son of King Bimbisara and Queen Nanda, fried a wild fruit that resembled a heart and gave it to the queen. The queen ate it and later felt ashamed for having such a demonic desire and she feared that the child might grow up and prove fatal for the family, thus after a few months of the child being born, the queen had him thrown out of the palace. When the child was lying near the garbage dump, a cock bit his little finger. King Bimbisara, learning about the child being thrown out, ran outside and picked up the child and put its bleeding little finger in his mouth and sucked it until it stopped bleeding and continued this for days until it was healed. As the little finger of the child was sore, he was nicknamed ''Kunika'' \"Sore Finger\". Later he was named ''Asokacanda''.<ref>Jain Aagam Uvavai Sutra chapter: Kunika</ref>\n\nIn the Buddhist ''[[Atthakatha]]'', the above story is almost the same, except that Kosaladevi desired to drink blood from Bimbisara's arm; the king obliged her and, later, when the child was thrown near the garbage dump, due to an infection he got a boil on his little finger and the king sucked it and once while sucking it the boil burst inside the king's mouth, but due to affection for his child he did not spit the pus out, rather swallowed it.\n\n== Death of his father ==\n=== The Jaina tradition ===\nOnce Ajatashatru was eating his meal with his newborn son in his lap, his son suddenly urinated, of which some drops fell onto his plate but due to affection for his child he did not change the plate but wiped the drops with his own patta (cloth on the shoulder) and continued to eat from the same plate. After eating a morsel he asked his mother Chellana, who was sitting in the same dining room, whether she had ever seen a father as loving and caring as he was, to which his mother narrated the story of King Bimbisara sucking Ajatshatru's little finger. This touched his heart and his affection for his father was aroused. At once he picked up an axe and hurried to the prison to free his father by breaking all the iron chains himself. But when Bimbisara saw him coming with an axe in his hand he thought, '' ... so, he is coming to kill me. It is better that I end my life with my own hands.''  At once he removed the ''Talaputa'' poison from his ring, closed his eyes and chanted ''\"Kevli pannato Dhammam saranam pavajyami\"'' (I seek refuge in the dharma taught by the kevlins or omniscient) and swallowed the poison and ended his life.\n\nAjatashatru repented a lot but it was of no use. Ajatashatru then moved his palace to ''Champa'' and made it his capital as the previous palace reminded him of his atrocious mistake.\n\n=== The Buddhist tradition ===\nThere are different versions existing in Buddhist texts on the death of King Bimbisara.\n\nIn one version, Ajatashatru allowed no one but Kosala Devi to meet Bimbisara in the smokey cell. Ajatashatru wanted to starve him to death, as Devadatta had said: \"father cannot be killed by a weapon.\" Thus Kosala Devi used to take small food packets to the cell, being caught by guards she started to take food hidden behind her hair, being caught again she started slipping in food by hiding it in her golden slippers again being caught she coated 4 layers of honey on her body which was licked by the king.  When she was caught once again Ajatashatru prohibited Kosala Devi from meeting the king. When Ajatashatru saw that the king was not dying even then he ordered a barber to pierce the king's legs with a knife, then pour salt, hot oil and fire made from ''khaira'' wood on him. When this was done the king died.\n\nIn an alternate version, Ajatashatru had King Bimbisara imprisoned and tried to starve him to death. Kosala Devi took food to King Bimbisara, but was found out and stopped from visiting him any more. Bimbisara grew weak, but he derived comfort from looking at the mountain where the Buddha and his disciples resided. So Ajatashatru asked that his cell windows be covered so that King Bimbisara could not see the mountain. One day, the Buddha visited the city and Bimbisara could see him and his disciples through the holes in his door. Because Bimbisara saw Buddha and his disciples, he derived comfort and continued to live. After knowing this, Ajatashatru ordered that Bimbisara's feet be skinned. After this, King Bimbisara could not move, and so he lay in bed getting weaker.\n\nThen one day, King Ajatashatru was having meal with his mother, Kosala Devi. He had a son, who was playing with a puppy. Ajatashatru asked, 'Where are you now?' The prince answered: \"I am playing with the puppy.\" King Ajatashatru asked the prince to have meal together. The prince arrived, but did not want to eat. King Ajatashatru asked, 'Why do you not want to eat?' The prince said, 'If you let me have my meal together with my puppy, I will eat.' King Ajatashatru said, 'As you wish.' So the prince took his meal, and brought the meal for the puppy too.\n\nKing Ajatashatru told his mother,'I did a difficult thing. Why do I say that? I am a king, and because I love my son, I had my meal together with dogs.' The mother said, 'This is nothing difficult. Why do I say that? There are people who eat dog meat, so what is strange in giving food to dogs? Do you know that your father did difficult things?' Ajatashatru asked, 'What difficult things?' The mother said, 'When you were young, your finger was wounded. You could not sleep for nights because of the pain. Your father held you on his lap and sucked on your finger. Your father had a soft body, so you could sleep well. Because of the warmth of his mouth, your wound's pus broke out. Your father thought that if he spat out the pus, it would increase your pain, so he swallowed the pus. Your father did such difficult thing for you. Please release him.'\n\nAjatashatru stayed silent after hearing this. Kosala Devi thought that he had agreed to release his father, so the palace released this news. Everywhere in the city, people heard that Bimbisara was going to be released, so everyone was happy and went to jail saying. 'King Bimbisara is going to be released!' Bimbisara heard this and thought to himself,' My son is evil and has no compassion on me. I do not know what else he will do to hurt me.' After this thought, he killed himself in front of his bed.

She saw Halla and Vihalla kumaras with their wives sitting on ''Sechanaka'' elephant and one of the wives wearing the 18 fold divine necklace. Then she heard one of the maidservants speaking from the garden below \"It's Halla and Vihalla kumaras and not the king who enjoy the real pleasures of the kingdom\" and she thought \"what's the use of the kingdom if I do not have both the jewels in my possession?\"\n\nSo, she shared this thought with Ajatashatru the same night and became excessively insistent in her demand. Ajatashatru, at last, agreed and sent a request to both his brothers to give the elephant and the necklace to him, which both his brothers denied saying that these gifts were given by their dear father so why should they part from them? Ajatashatru sent the request thrice but got the same reply all three times.  This annoyed him a lot, so he sent his men to arrest them. Meanwhile, Halla and the Vihalla kumaras availed a chance and escaped to their maternal grandfather ''Chetaka'' who was the king of the great kingdom of the Vaishali republic (Vajjis/[[Licchavi (clan)|Lichchavis]]). Ajatashatru sent notice thrice to Chetaka to surrender them but was denied by Chetaka.\n\nThis was enough for Ajatashatru.  He called his half brothers, Kalakumaras ''(10 kalakumaras, those born to King Bimbisara and 10 Kali Queens Kali, Sukali, Mahakali, etc.)'' to merge their army with his, since it was well known to Ajatashatru that Vaishali republic had always been invincible in the past and he alone would not be able to defeat it. Each Kalakumara brought 3000 horses, 3000 elephants, 3000 chariots and 30000 infantrymen each. On the other hand, Chetaka invited his own allies ''9 Mallas, 9 Lichhvis and 18 kings of Kasi-Kosala'' to fight his grandson Ajatashatru. All these kings came with  3000 horses, 3000 elephants, 3000 chariots and 30000 infantrymen each. Thus all together there were 57000 elephants, 57000 chariots, 57000 horses, and 570000 infantrymen.\n\nThe war began. King Chetaka was a devout follower of Lord [[Mahavira]] and had a vow to not shoot more than one arrow per day in a war. It was known to all that Chetaka's aim was perfect and his arrows were infallible. His first arrow killed one Kalakumara, commander of Ajatashatru. On the consecutive nine days the rest of the nine Kalakumaras were killed by Chetaka. Deeply sorrowed by the death of their sons, the Kali queens were initiated as nuns in the holy order of Lord Mahavira.\n\nAs Ajatashatru was moving towards defeat he practised penance for three days and offered prayers to Sakrendra and Charmendra ([[Indra]] of different heavens) who then helped him in the war.  They protected him from the infallible arrow of Chetaka. The war became very severe and by the divine influence of the Indras even the pebbles, straws, leaves hurled by Ajatashatru's men were said to have fell like rocks on the army of Chetaka. This weapon was thus named ''\"'''Mahasilakantaka'''\"'', i.e. the weapon through which more than a lakh (1,00,000) people died. Next, the Indras granted a huge, automatically moving chariot with swinging spiked maces on each side, and said to have been driven by Charmendra himself, to Ajatashatru. The chariot moved about in the battlefield crushing lakhs of soldiers. This war-chariot was named ''Ratha-Musala''.\n\nIn this battle, Chetaka was defeated. But, Chetaka and others immediately took shelter inside the city walls of Vaishali and closed the main gate.  The walls around Vaishali were so strong that Ajatashatru was unable to break through them. Many days passed, Ajatashatru became furious and again prayed to Indra, but this time Indra refused to help him. But Ajatashatru was informed by an oracle of a demi-goddess \"Vaishali can be conquered if ''Sramana (monk) Kulvalaka'' gets married to a courtesan.\"\n\nAjatashatru inquired about the monk Kulvalaka and sent for the prostitute ''Magadhika'' disguised as a devout follower. The fallen women attracted the monk towards herself and finally, the monk gave up his monkhood and married her. Later Magadhika on Ajatashatru's orders brainwashed Kulvalaka to enter Vaishali disguised as an astrologer. With great difficulty, he did enter Vaishali and learned that the city was saved by a ''Chaitya'' (altar) dedicated to ''[[Munisuvrata]]''. Kulvalaka then started telling people that this altar is the reason why the city is suffering through a bad period. The people uprooted the altar from its very foundation. Kulvalaka gave a signal and Ajatashatru proceeded as per prior arrangement. This was the last attack. Vaishali was conquered by Ajatashatru.\n\nSechanaka the elephant died after it fell in a pit with iron rods and fire made by Ajatashatru's soldiers. Later ''Halla and Vihalla kumaras'' got initiated as monks in the holy order of Lord Mahavira. Chetaka courted ''Sallekahna''(fasted unto death).  Ajatashatru not only conquered Vaishali but also Kasi-Kosala. Manudev was a famous king of the illustrious [[Licchavi (clan)|Lichchavi clan]] of the confederacy, who desired to possess [[Amrapali]] after he saw her dance performance in [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]].<ref>http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-01-31/books/31281015_1_amrapali-nagarvadhu-woman-warrior</ref>{{unreliable source?|date=September 2016}} After defeating the king, Ajatashatru was in a relationship with Amrapali.\n\n=== The Buddhist tradition ===\nThere was a diamond mine near a village on the river [[Ganges]]. There was an agreement between Ajatashatru and the [[Licchavi (clan)|Licchavi]] of [[Vajji]] that they would have an equal share of the diamonds. Because of sheer lethargy, Ajatashatru failed to collect his own share, and the whole lot of diamonds was carried away by the Lichhavis. This happened many times, and at last, Ajatashatru got annoyed and thought, \"it is almost impossible to fight against the whole confederacy of Vaishali. I must uproot these powerful Vajjis and exterminate them\". He sent his chief minister Vassakara to Lord [[Buddha]] to ask him the purpose of Vaishali being invincible, to which Lord Buddha gave seven reasons which included Vajjis being punctual to the meetings, their disciplined behavior, their respect for elders, respect for women, they do not marry their daughters forcefully, they give spiritual protection to the [[Arhats]], and the main reason was the Chaityas (altar) inside the town.\n\nThus, with the help of his chief minister Vassakara, Ajatashatru managed to split the Vajjis and also broke the chaityas inside. Ajatashatru used a scythed chariot with swinging mace and blades on both the sides and attacked the town and conquered it.\n\n== Kingdom ==\n{{See also|Magadha|Maurya Empire}}\nAfter conquering Vaishali, Kasi and [[Kosala]] (Kaushala) Ajatashatru conquered 36 republican states surrounding his kingdom and firmly established the predominance of Magadha.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Ajatashatru was monarch of a huge kingdom, which covered almost all of modern India's [[Bihar]], [[Chandigarh]], [[Haryana]], [[Uttarakhand]], [[Himachal Pradesh]], [[Delhi]], [[Uttar Pradesh]],  One fourth of north [[Madhya Pradesh]], tip of [[Chhattisgarh]], [[Jharkhand]], and [[west Bengal]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}\n\nAjatashatru, with the help of his two ministers Sunidha and Vassak\u0101ra, built a fort near the banks of the river [[Ganges]] to strengthen the defense of Magadha and named it P\u0101tali Grama(village). Later it developed into a city, which soon became popular as [[Pataliputra]], now known as [[Patna]], the capital of [[Bihar]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nAccording to ''Mahaparinirvana sutta'', when Pataliputra was being erected, by chance the Buddha came there and praised the city of Pataliputra, and pointed to three things which could prove fatal to the city: fire, water, and discord among the people.\n\n== Family ==\n\n=== The Jaina tradition ===\n\nAccording to the ''Niray\u0101valiy\u0101 Sutt\u0101''  Ajatashatru was born to King Bimbisara and Queen Chellana, who was the daughter of ''Chetaka'' the king of Vaishali, who was the brother of ''Queen Tri\u015bal\u00e1'', mother of Mahavira. Ajatashatru had eight wives.\n\n=== The Buddhist tradition ===\nAccording to ''D\u012bgha nik\u0101ya,'' Ajatashatru was born to King Bimbisara and Queen [[Kosala Devi]], who was the daughter of ''Maha-Kosala'', the king of Kosala and sister of ''Pasenadi'' who later succeeded to the throne. Ajatashatru had 500 wives but the principal consort was [[Princess Vajira]].{{sfn|Upinder Singh|2016|p=271}} The City of Kasi was given to Bimbisara as dowry by Maha-Kosala. After the murder of Bimbisara, Prasenajit took the city back.  This resulted in a war between Ajatashatru and Prasenajit, in which Prasenajit was first defeated but became successful later. As Ajatashatru happened to be his nephew his life was spared.  In a peace treaty, Prasenajit married his daughter Vajira to him. Ajatashatru later had a son named ''Udayabhadda or Udayabhadra''.\n\n== Death ==\nThe account of Ajatashatru's death recorded by historians is {{circa|535 BCE}}.{{sfn|Thapar|1990|p=}}{{page needed|date=September 2016}} The account of his death differs widely between Jain and Buddhist traditions. Other accounts point towards {{circa|460 BCE}}<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=0IquM4BrJ4YC&pg=PT92&dq=ajatashatru#v=onepage&q=ajatashatru&f=false India: A History. Revised and Updated], by John Keay</ref> as the year of his death.\n\n=== The Jaina tradition ===\nAccording to the Jaina text, ''\u0100va\u015b\u0233aka Ch\u016brn\u012b,'' Ajatashatru went to meet Lord Mahavira. <br />\nAjatashatru asked,  \"Bhante! Where do [[Chakravartin]]s (world-monarchs) go after their death?\"<br />\nMahavira replied that \"A Chakravartin, if dying while in the office goes to the seventh hell called ''Mah\u0101-Tamahprabh\u0101'', and if dying as a monk attains [[Nirvana]].\"<br />\nAjatashatru asked, \"So will I Attain ''Nirvana'' or go to the seventh hell?\"<br />\nMahavira replied, \"Neither of them, you will go to the Sixth hell.\" <br />\nAjatashatru asked, \"Bhante, then am I not a Chakravartin?\",<br />\nto which Mahavira replied, \"No, you are not.\"\n\nThis made Ajatashatru anxious to become a world-monarch. He created 12 artificial jewels and set out for the conquest of the six regions of the world. But when he reached the ''Timisra Caves'' he was stopped by a guardian [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] called ''Krutam\u0101l'' who said, \"Only a Chakravartin can pass through this cave, there can be not more than 12 Chakravartin in the half cycle of a ''Kalchakra'', and already there have been 12.\"  On this, Ajatashatru said arrogantly, \"Then count me as the thirteenth and let me go or else my mace is strong enough to reach you to [[Yama]].\" The Deva became enraged at Ajatashatru's arrogance and by his power, he reduced him to ashes right on the spot. Ajatashatru was then reborn in the sixth hell called ''Tamahprabh\u0101''.\n\n=== The Buddhist tradition ===\nAjatashatru was brutally murdered by his own son, Udayabhadra, who was greedy of his kingdom. Ajatashatru was reborn in the hell called \"Lohakumbhiya\".\n\nAlthough the account of Ajatashatru's death differs in these traditions, both believe that after passing through many births Ajatashatru will be born as a wise prince, and later become a monk and attain Nirvana.\n\n== Religion ==\nAjatashatru is mentioned in both Jaina and Buddhist traditions.\n\nThe ''Uvavai/Aupap\u0101tika sutta,'' which is the first ''Up\u0101nga'' (see [[Jain Agamas (\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara)|Jain Agamas]]) of the Jains throws light on the relation between Mahavira and Ajatashatru. It accounts that Ajatashatru held Mahavira in the highest esteem. The same text also states that Ajatashatru had an officer to report to him about the daily routine of Mahavira. He was paid lavishly. The officer had a vast network and supporting field staff through whom he collected all the information about Mahavira and reported to the king. The ''Uvavai Sutta'' has detailed and illuminating discussion on Mahavira's arrival at the city of Champa, the honour was shown to him by Ajatashatru, the sermon given by Mahavira in [[Ardhamagadhi]] language, etc.\n\nAccording to Buddhist tradition, the ''[[Sama\u00f1\u00f1aphala Sutta]]'' deals with his first meeting with the Buddha, where he realized his mistakes with his association to Devadatta and plan to killing his own father.  According to the same text, during this meeting, Ajatashatru took protection of the Buddha, the [[Dhamma]] and the [[Sangha (Buddhism)|Sangha]].  He was mentioned more than once in several other Sutta as an example of strong devotee to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha.  He erected a vast ''[[Stupa]]'' on the bones and ashes of the Buddha after the funeral, and Ajatashatru also was present in the first Buddhist council at the Sattapanni (Saptparni) caves [[Rajgriha]].\n\nWhether Ajatashatru was a Jain or Buddhist, both texts accounted for him as a devotee of the respective religions.\n\n== Depictions in popular culture ==\n* A fictionalised account of Ajatashatru&nbsp;\u2013 depicted as a physically gross and tyrannous figure&nbsp;, who delights in committing atrocities and massacres \u2013 appears in [[Gore Vidal]]'s novel ''[[Creation (novel)|Creation]]''.\n* A film about his life was released titled ''Ajatashatru''.

It was highly valued in other countries, which allowed for a profitable trade. Also known as a substitute for money were [[Shell money|small cowries shells]] ([[Monetaria moneta|Cypraea]]). But nevertheless finds of skins and shells come across not so often. The basis of all the treasures dating back to this period were foreign [[silver]] [[coin]]s.\n\nTogether with the emergence of the first ancient settlements in the late 8th to early [[9th century]], foreign coins appeared on [[Slavs|Slavic]] lands of [[Eastern Europe]]. The formation of money circulation started when active trade in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] with the countries of the [[Caliphate]] began. [[Eastern European]] countries, deprived of large ore reserves of monetary [[metal]], actively imported [[silver]]. In the first third of the 9th century, [[coin]]s ([[dirham]]s) which were minted in the [[Africa]]n centers of the [[Caliphate]] and which reached [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]]' via the [[Caucasus]] and [[Silk Road|Central Asian trade routes]] became widespread in ancient [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Dirham]]s were used as a means of payment, worn as jewelry and melted down. In the northern regions, [[Western Europe]]an [[denarius]] of [[Germany|German]], [[England|English]] and [[Scandinavia]]n coinage came to replace [[dirham]]s. They were in [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] until the beginning of the 12th century, when the [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] of foreign coins ceased, most likely due to a decrease in the [[silver]] sample, and replaced by silver bars ([[Grivna|hryvnia]]), held out until the middle of the 14th century.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe main means of circulation of [[Southern Russia]] ([[Kiev]], [[Chernihiv|Chernigov]], [[Smolensk]], etc.) were cuttings from [[dirham]]s weighing 1.38 grams (Rezanas), which were 1/200 of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[litra]]s. Similar cuttings were used on the lands of [[Northern Russia]], but their weight was 1.04 grams or 1/200 silver [[Grivna|hryvnia]].\n\nAt the turn of the 10th to 11th centuries at the time of [[Vladimir the Great]] and [[Sviatopolk I of Kiev|Svyatopolk]] was made an attempt to [[Coining (mint)|stamp]] [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] coins.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Hryvnia - Kuna monetary system ===\n\n==== Kuna ====\nKuna is a weight and monetary unit, as well as the name of the [[coin]]s used in [[Russia]] in the 9th to 15th centuries. Russian money [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] arose at the beginning of the IX century due to the massive penetration into the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] lands of the eastern [[dirham]] weighing 2.73 g which gets the name \"Kuna\". Later, with the advent of [[Western Europe]]an [[silver]] [[coin]]s in Russian money [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]], the European [[denarius]] became also known as kuna.

It was used, in particular, to measure the weight of [[silver]] and [[gold]] (from which it's monetary equivalent appeared). The golden [[Grivna|hryvnia]] was 12.5 times more expensive than silver one. The first weight unit referred in the [[Old Russian Chronicles|ancient Russian chronicles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://proudofukraine.com/ukrainian-currency/|title=Currency of Ukraine hryvnia - symbol, banknotes and coins images|language=ru-RU|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref>\n\nOriginal article [[Grivna|Hryvnia]] [[Grivna]]\n\n==== Veksha ====\nVeksha (squirrel, veveritsa) is the smallest monetary unit of Ancient Rus of the 9th through 12th centuries. It was first mentioned in [[Primary Chronicle|The Tale of Bygone Years]]; also it was mentioned in the [[Russkaya Pravda|Rus' Justice]]. It was equaled to 1/6 kuna. Silver veksha weighed about 1/3 grams.\n\nIn real money circulation, 2 vekshas were equal to Western European [[denarius]]. The ancient Russian translators of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] authors identified veksha with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[copper]] coin \u201c[[Nummus|Nummi]]\u201d. Proponents of the so-called fur theory of monetary circulation in the Ancient Rus' consider the Veksha to be tanned [[squirrel]] skin, which was used simultaneously with its coin counterpart (part of the silver Arab [[dirham]])<ref name=\":1\" />\n[[File:Rezana.jpg|alt=Cutted Arabic silver dirham|thumb|144x144px|Rezana (Cutted Arabic silver dirham)]]\n\n==== Rezana ====\nRezana is the monetary unit of Ancient Rus and neighboring lands. Cuted half of the [[Arab world|Arab]] [[dirham]] was called Rezana, that is, 1 cut was equal to about 1.38 grams of 900th sample [[silver]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.numizm.ru/html/r/rezana.html|title=\u0420\u0415\u0417\u0410\u041d\u0410. \u0421\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430\u0440\u044c \u043d\u0443\u043c\u0438\u0437\u043c\u0430\u0442\u0430|website=www.numizm.ru|access-date=2019-05-08}}</ref>\n\nThe name Rezana(\u0440\u0463\u0437\u0430\u043d\u0430) is derived from the verb REZAT'(\u0440\u0463\u0437\u0430\u0442\u0438) and originated from the [[Old Russian language|old Russian]]. When dirham received the name \u201cKuna\u201d, the equivalent of a part of kuna was called \u201crezana\u201d. Fragments of [[dirhams]] (1/2, 1/4, etc.) are often found in ancient Russian treasures. The fragmentation of dirhams indicates that the whole coin was too large for small trade transactions.\n\nIn the IX century. Rezana was equal to 1/50 of the [[Grivna|hryvnia]], in the XII century equated to kuna due to the fact that kuna became twice as light and was not 1/25, but 1/50 [[Grivna|hryvnia]]. Kuna and rezana existed in parallel, but gradually the counting on the kuna became more common. Rezanas existed until the XII century, when the flow of silver [[dirhams]] from [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] finally dried up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.russian-money.ru/|title=Russian coins and banknotes of all time|website=en.russian-money.ru|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Rus' coins ===\n[[File:\u0417\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 (\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446 X - \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e XI \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430).jpg|thumb|Zlatnik]]\n\n==== Zlatnik ====\nZlatnik (also - zolotnik) - the first ancient Russian [[gold]] [[coin]], minted in [[Kiev]] in the late 10th and early 11th centuries, shortly after the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Baptism of Russia]] by [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir]].\n\nThe real name of these coins is unknown, the term \u201czlatnik\u201d is used in [[numismatics]] traditionally and is known from the text of the [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty|Rus'-Byzantine treaty]]{{dn|date=February 2020}} of the year 912 of the Prophetic [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]]. 1 zlatnik was 1/35 of kievan gold [[Grivna|hryvnia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212131/http://www.ukrmuseum.org.ua/ua/main/treasures/show/1426.html|title=\u041c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438|date=2007-10-13|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> The mass of Zlatnik (about 4.2 g) was later used as the basis for the Russian weight unit, the Zolotnik.\n\nThe appearance of Russian coinage was the result of the revival of trade and cultural ties with [[Byzantium]].

Silver coinage continued at the beginning of the XI century under the reign of [[Sviatopolk I of Kiev|Svyatopolk]] and [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]], however, the coinage of Zlatniks after the death of [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] no longer resumed. Judging by the small number of copies that have come down to us, the release of Zlatniks was extremely short in time (perhaps one or two years) and small in volume. However, all currently known copies of Zlatniks found in treasures, along with other coins of that time, bear traces of being in circulation - therefore, these coins were not ritual, award or gift. In the 11th century, judging by the findings of these coins in the treasures in [[Pinsk]] and [[Kienberg, Switzerland|Kienburg]], Zlatniks also participated in international money circulation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0418\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442 X\u2014XI \u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u042d\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0435|last=\u0421\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u041c. \u041f.|first=|publisher=\u0410\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430, 1977|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===== Description of the coin type =====\nReverse: a chest portrait of [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir]] in a hat with pendants topped with a cross.

Srebreniks of the first issues basically repeated the type of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] coins (the front side is the image of the prince, the back side is the image of [[Jesus|Christ]]). In the 11th century, the image of [[Jesus|Christ]] was replaced by a large patrimonial sign of [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikovich]]. A legend was placed around the portrait of the prince: \u201c[[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] on the throne, and here is his silver\u201d.\n\nSrebrenik of [[Yaroslav the Wise]] differed from the described appearance. On one side, instead of [[Jesus|Christ]], there was an image of [[Saint George|St. Georgy]] (Christian patron of [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]), on the other - the patrimonial sign of [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikovich]] and the inscription: \u201c[[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslavs]] silver\u201d without the words \u201con the throne\u201d, which gives reason to attribute their release to the period of [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]'s reign in [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] during the life of [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir Svyatoslavovich]]. [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]\u2019s Srebrenik is a unique phenomenon in the coin production of Europe of the XI century in relation to the masterful execution of a coin stamp, sometimes even causing suspicions that these are later fakes. A completely different type is represented by the [[Tmutarakan]] coins, on one side of which was an image of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]], and on the other side the inscription: \u201cLord, help Michael\u201d. The technique of making Srebrenik has its own characteristics. Circles were not cut from the plate (as in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Arab world|Arabic]] coins), but were molded.\n\n== Coinless period from the 12th century (commodity-money) ==\n==== Description of the period ====\nThe coinless period is a period in the history of the currency of Ancient Russia, characterized by an almost complete absence of both foreign and domestic coins. After the extinction of the inflow of eastern coins to Russia due to the weakening of the [[Caliphate]], they were replaced by [[Commodity money|commodity-money]]. This period began in the 12th century and ended in the 14th century. Commodity money were used as a medium of circulation. Large calculations were made with the help of [[cattle]] and [[silver]] [[ingot]]s - [[Grivna|hryvnias]]; for small calculations was used fur, sometimes glass bracelets, beads, spindling, and other standard products of ancient Russian crafts. In some cases, even the [[Shell money|cowry shells]], which in [[Siberia]] retained their value as a small change coin until the beginning of the 19th century.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nStarting with the establishment of the [[Tatar-Mongol yoke]], the economy of the ancient Russian principalities is increasingly acquiring natural features. The main function of money became the function in the means of accumulation: coins were hoarding and deposit in treasures. This period was called coinless, covering the 12th through 14th centuries.\n\nOwn silver deposits were discovered in Russia only in the 18th century, therefore the country's monetary economy depended entirely on the influx of this metal, primarily in the form of a coin, from abroad. In the 12th century, this influx began to shorten from the western direction (presumably due to the strengthening of the [[Germany|German]] knight orders in the [[Baltic states|Baltic States]] and the beginning of regular hostilities between them and the western principalities; see the article \u201c[[Ostsiedlung]]\u201d), and in the 13th century from the eastern (presumably, this was caused by the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Tatar-Mongol invasion]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?hl=ru&id=WI9NAQAAIAAJ&dq=%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD+%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD|title=\u0411\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043e-\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 XII-XV \u0432\u0432|last=\u041c\u0443\u0445\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432|first=\u0410\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0440 \u0413\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|date=1983|publisher=\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430|language=ru}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the coinless period is associated with the gradual restoration of trade relations (both internal and external), with the beginning of the spread of Juchi coins (silver [[dirham]]s and copper pools of the [[Golden Horde]])\n[[File:Bulryasia.jpg|thumb|Ovruch slate spindle whorl]]\n\n==== Ovruch slate spindle whorl ====\nOvruch slate spindle whorl - [[spindle whorl]], carved out of pink and red slate stone ([[Pyrophyllite|pyrophyllite slate]]), which was mined in the territory of present-day [[Ukraine]], near the town of [[Ovruch]] in the 10th through 13th centuries.

For this period coins disappeared in Russia. For large payments were used [[Grivna|hryvnia-ingots]].\n\nThe original theory of commodity-money was proposed by [[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]]. The scientist stated that the role of money for small payments could be fulfilled by some uniform and widespread products in Ancient Russia - such as crystal and cornelian beads, often marked in hoards with coins, multi-colored glass bracelets, and ovruch slate spindle whorls. These [[spindle whorl]]s were repeatedly met in hoards along with ingots, and during excavations in [[Pskov]], for example, they were found in a wallet with [[Western Europe]]an [[coin]]s. When [[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]] combined the distribution maps of glass bracelets and [[slate]] [[Spindle whorl|spindles whorls]], and also plotted the boundaries of the monetary circulation area before the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]], their detailed coincidence was discovered. Slate [[spindle whorl]] could well play the role of a coin. It was impossible to fake it, because the [[Slate|pink slate]] deposit in [[Ovruch]] was the only one in [[Eastern Europe]]. In [[China]], according to one of the versions, the spindle became the prototype of the first coins with a square hole.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Cowry coin ====\nAnd one more find attracted the attention of scientists: [[Monetaria moneta|Cypraea's shell]] - the [[Shell money|cowry coin]]. These beautiful porcelain shells were mined only around the [[Maldives]] and [[Lakshadweep|Laccadives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].

It was highly valued in other countries, which allowed for a profitable trade. Also known as a substitute for money were [[Shell money|small cowries shells]] ([[Monetaria moneta|Cypraea]]). But nevertheless finds of skins and shells come across not so often. The basis of all the treasures dating back to this period were foreign [[silver]] [[coin]]s.\n\nTogether with the emergence of the first ancient settlements in the late VIII - early [[9th century|IX century]], foreign coins appeared on [[Slavs|Slavic]] lands of [[Eastern Europe]]. The formation of money circulation started when active trade in [[Northern Europe|Northern]] and [[Eastern Europe]] with the countries of the [[Caliphate]] began. [[Eastern European]] countries, deprived of large ore reserves of monetary [[metal]], actively imported [[silver]]. In the first third of the IX century, [[coin]]s ([[dirham]]s) which were minted in the [[Africa]]n centers of the [[Caliphate]] and which reached [[Kievan Rus'|Rus]]' via the [[Caucasus]] and [[Silk Road|Central Asian trade routes]] became widespread in ancient [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']].<ref name=\":0\" /> [[Dirham]]s were used as a means of payment, worn as jewelry and melted down. In the northern regions, [[Western Europe]]an [[denarius]] of [[Germany|German]], [[England|English]] and [[Scandinavia]]n coinage came to replace [[dirham]]s. They were in [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] until the beginning of the XII century, when the [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] of foreign coins ceased, most likely due to a decrease in the [[silver]] sample, and replaced by silver bars ([[Grivna|hryvnia]]), held out until the middle of the XIV century.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe main means of circulation of [[Southern Russia]] ([[Kiev]], [[Chernihiv|Chernigov]], [[Smolensk]], etc.) were cuttings from [[dirham]]s weighing 1.38 grams (Rezanas), which were 1/200 of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[litra]]s. Similar cuttings were used on the lands of [[Northern Russia]], but their weight was 1.04 grams or 1/200 silver [[Grivna|hryvnia]].\n\nAt the turn of the X - XI centuries at the time of [[Vladimir the Great]] and [[Sviatopolk I of Kiev|Svyatopolk]] was made an attempt to [[Coining (mint)|stamp]] [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] coins.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Hryvnia - Kuna monetary system ===\n\n==== Kuna ====\nKuna is a weight and monetary unit, as well as the name of the [[coin]]s used in [[Russia]] in the X - XV centuries. Russian money [[Circulation (currency)|circulation]] arose at the beginning of the IX century due to the massive penetration into the [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] lands of the eastern [[dirham]] weighing 2.73 g which gets the name \"Kuna\".

It was used, in particular, to measure the weight of [[silver]] and [[gold]] (from which it's monetary equivalent appeared).

Silver veksha weighed about 1/3 grams.\n\nIn real money circulation, 2 vekshas were equal to Western European [[denarius]]. The ancient Russian translators of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] authors identified veksha with the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[copper]] coin \u201c[[Nummus|Nummi]]\u201d.

When dirham received the name \u201cKuna\u201d, the equivalent of a part of kuna was called \u201crezana\u201d. Fragments of [[dirhams]] (1/2, 1/4, etc.) are often found in ancient Russian treasures. The fragmentation of dirhams indicates that the whole coin was too large for small trade transactions.\n\nIn the IX century. Rezana was equal to 1/50 of the [[Grivna|hryvnia]], in the XII century equated to kuna due to the fact that kuna became twice as light and was not 1/25, but 1/50 [[Grivna|hryvnia]]. Kuna and rezana existed in parallel, but gradually the counting on the kuna became more common. Rezanas existed until the XII century, when the flow of silver [[dirhams]] from [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]] finally dried up.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://en.russian-money.ru/|title=Russian coins and banknotes of all time|website=en.russian-money.ru|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref>\n\n=== Rus' coins ===\n[[File:\u0417\u043b\u0430\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a \u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 (\u043a\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0446 X - \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0430\u043b\u043e XI \u0432\u0435\u043a\u0430).jpg|thumb|Zlatnik]]\n\n==== Zlatnik ====\nZlatnik (also - zolotnik) - the first ancient Russian [[gold]] [[coin]], minted in [[Kiev]] in the late X and early XI centuries, shortly after the [[Christianization of Kievan Rus'|Baptism of Russia]] by [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir]].\n\nThe real name of these coins is unknown, the term \u201czlatnik\u201d is used in [[numismatics]] traditionally and is known from the text of the [[Rus'\u2013Byzantine Treaty|Rus'-Byzantine treaty]]{{dn|date=February 2020}} of the year 912 of the Prophetic [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]]. 1 zlatnik was 1/35 of kievan gold [[Grivna|hryvnia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071013212131/http://www.ukrmuseum.org.ua/ua/main/treasures/show/1426.html|title=\u041c\u0443\u0437\u0435\u0439\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b \u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0457\u043d\u0438|date=2007-10-13|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2019-05-29}}</ref> The mass of Zlatnik (about 4.2 g) was later used as the basis for the Russian weight unit, the Zolotnik.\n\nThe appearance of Russian coinage was the result of the revival of trade and cultural ties with [[Byzantium]]. The obvious model for Vladimir's Zlatniks was the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] [[Solidus (coin)|Solidus]] of the emperors [[Basil II]] and [[Constantine VIII]], which are similar to the Zlatniks by weight (about 4.2 grams) and the arrangement of images.\n\n===== General information =====\nIt has been repeatedly suggested that the start of minting in Russia of its own [[coin]] ([[gold]] and [[silver]]) did not so much meet the requirements of the [[economy]] (money circulation in Russia was provided by imported [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]], [[Arab world|Arab]] and [[Western Europe]]an coins; there were no sources of monetary metal in [[Russia]]) but the significance of the [[Russia]]n state. Silver coinage continued at the beginning of the XI century under the reign of [[Sviatopolk I of Kiev|Svyatopolk]] and [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]], however, the coinage of Zlatniks after the death of [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] no longer resumed. Judging by the small number of copies that have come down to us, the release of Zlatniks was extremely short in time (perhaps one or two years) and small in volume. However, all currently known copies of Zlatniks found in treasures, along with other coins of that time, bear traces of being in circulation - therefore, these coins were not ritual, award or gift. In the XI century, judging by the findings of these coins in the treasures in [[Pinsk]] and [[Kienberg, Switzerland|Kienburg]], Zlatniks also participated in international money circulation.<ref>{{Cite book|title=\u0418\u0442\u043e\u0433\u0438 \u0438\u0437\u0443\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0445 \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442 X\u2014XI \u0432\u0435\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0432 \u0413\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0441\u0442\u0432\u0435\u043d\u043d\u043e\u043c \u042d\u0440\u043c\u0438\u0442\u0430\u0436\u0435|last=\u0421\u043e\u0442\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0430, \u041c. \u041f.|first=|publisher=\u0410\u0432\u0440\u043e\u0440\u0430, 1977|year=1977|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n===== Description of the coin type =====\nReverse: a chest portrait of [[Vladimir the Great|Prince Vladimir]] in a hat with pendants topped with a cross.

Srebreniks of the first issues basically repeated the type of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] coins (the front side is the image of the prince, the back side is the image of [[Jesus|Christ]]). In the XI century, the image of [[Jesus|Christ]] was replaced by a large patrimonial sign of [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikovich]]. A legend was placed around the portrait of the prince: \u201c[[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir]] on the throne, and here is his silver\u201d.\n\nSrebrenik of [[Yaroslav the Wise]] differed from the described appearance. On one side, instead of [[Jesus|Christ]], there was an image of [[Saint George|St. Georgy]] (Christian patron of [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]), on the other - the patrimonial sign of [[Rurik dynasty|Rurikovich]] and the inscription: \u201c[[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslavs]] silver\u201d without the words \u201con the throne\u201d, which gives reason to attribute their release to the period of [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]'s reign in [[Novgorod Republic|Novgorod]] during the life of [[Vladimir the Great|Vladimir Svyatoslavovich]]. [[Yaroslav the Wise|Yaroslav]]\u2019s Srebrenik is a unique phenomenon in the coin production of Europe of the XI century in relation to the masterful execution of a coin stamp, sometimes even causing suspicions that these are later fakes. A completely different type is represented by the [[Tmutarakan]] coins, on one side of which was an image of the [[Michael (archangel)|Archangel Michael]], and on the other side the inscription: \u201cLord, help Michael\u201d. The technique of making Srebrenik has its own characteristics. Circles were not cut from the plate (as in the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] and [[Arab world|Arabic]] coins), but were molded.\n\n== Coinless period from XII century (commodity-money) ==\n==== Description of the period ====\nThe coinless period is a period in the history of the currency of Ancient Russia, characterized by an almost complete absence of both foreign and domestic coins. After the extinction of the inflow of eastern coins to Russia due to the weakening of the [[Caliphate]], they were replaced by [[Commodity money|commodity-money]]. This period began in the XII century and ended in the XIV century. Commodity money were used as a medium of circulation. Large calculations were made with the help of [[cattle]] and [[silver]] [[ingot]]s - [[Grivna|hryvnias]]; for small calculations was used fur, sometimes glass bracelets, beads, spindling, and other standard products of ancient Russian crafts.

The main function of money became the function in the means of accumulation: coins were hoarding and deposit in treasures. This period was called coinless, covering the XII, XIII and XIV centuries.\n\nOwn silver deposits were discovered in Russia only in the XVIII century, therefore the country's monetary economy depended entirely on the influx of this metal, primarily in the form of a coin, from abroad. In the XII century, this influx began to shorten from the western direction (presumably due to the strengthening of the [[Germany|German]] knight orders in the [[Baltic states|Baltic States]] and the beginning of regular hostilities between them and the western principalities; see the article \u201c[[Ostsiedlung]]\u201d), and in the XIII century from the eastern (presumably, this was caused by the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Tatar-Mongol invasion]]).<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.ru/books?hl=ru&id=WI9NAQAAIAAJ&dq=%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD+%D0%B4%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80&focus=searchwithinvolume&q=%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B%D0%BD|title=\u0411\u0443\u043b\u0433\u0430\u0440\u043e-\u0442\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0440\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u043c\u043e\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 XII-XV \u0432\u0432|last=\u041c\u0443\u0445\u0430\u043c\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0435\u0432|first=\u0410\u0437\u0433\u0430\u0440 \u0413\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0443\u043b\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447|date=1983|publisher=\u041d\u0430\u0443\u043a\u0430|language=ru}}</ref>\n\nThe end of the coinless period is associated with the gradual restoration of trade relations (both internal and external), with the beginning of the spread of Juchi coins (silver [[dirham]]s and copper pools of the [[Golden Horde]])\n[[File:Bulryasia.jpg|thumb|Ovruch slate spindle whorl]]\n\n==== Ovruch slate spindle whorl ====\nOvruch slate spindle whorl - [[spindle whorl]], carved out of pink and red slate stone ([[Pyrophyllite|pyrophyllite slate]]), which was mined in the territory of present-day [[Ukraine]], near the town of [[Ovruch]] in the X - XIII centuries.

For this period coins disappeared in Russia. For large payments were used [[Grivna|hryvnia-ingots]].\n\nThe original theory of commodity-money was proposed by [[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]]. The scientist stated that the role of money for small payments could be fulfilled by some uniform and widespread products in Ancient Russia - such as crystal and cornelian beads, often marked in hoards with coins, multi-colored glass bracelets, and ovruch slate spindle whorls. These [[spindle whorl]]s were repeatedly met in hoards along with ingots, and during excavations in [[Pskov]], for example, they were found in a wallet with [[Western Europe]]an [[coin]]s. When [[Valentin Yanin|V. L. Yanin]] combined the distribution maps of glass bracelets and [[slate]] [[Spindle whorl|spindles whorls]], and also plotted the boundaries of the monetary circulation area before the [[Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus'|Mongol invasion]], their detailed coincidence was discovered. Slate [[spindle whorl]] could well play the role of a coin. It was impossible to fake it, because the [[Slate|pink slate]] deposit in [[Ovruch]] was the only one in [[Eastern Europe]]. In [[China]], according to one of the versions, the spindle became the prototype of the first coins with a square hole.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\n==== Cowry coin ====\nAnd one more find attracted the attention of scientists: [[Monetaria moneta|Cypraea's shell]] - the [[Shell money|cowry coin]].

The transmembrane duct is located in the outer membrane of the cell. The duct is also bound to two other proteins: a periplasmic membrane protein and an integral membrane transporter. The periplasmic membrane protein and the inner membrane protein of the system are coupled to control the opening and closing of the duct (channel). When a toxin binds to this inner membrane protein, the inner membrane proteins gives rise to a biochemical cascade that transmits signals to the periplasmic membrane protein and outer membrane protein to open the channel and move the toxin out of the cell. This mechanism uses an energy-dependent, protein-protein interaction that is generated by the transfer of the toxin for an H+ ion by the inner membrane transporter.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ughachukwu P, Unekwe P | title = Efflux pump-mediated resistance in chemotherapy | journal = Annals of Medical and Health Sciences Research | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 191\u20138 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 23439914 | pmc = 3573517 | doi = 10.4103/2141-9248.105671 }}</ref>\n\n=== Function ===\nAlthough antibiotics are the most clinically important substrates of efflux systems, it is probable that most efflux pumps have other natural physiological functions.

The transmembrane duct is located in the outer membrane of the cell. The duct is also bound to two other proteins: a periplasmic membrane protein and an integral membrane transporter. The periplasmic membrane protein and the inner membrane protein of the system are coupled to control the opening and closing of the duct (channel). When a toxin binds to this inner membrane protein, the inner membrane proteins gives rise to a biochemical cascade that transmits signals to the periplasmic membrane protein and outer membrane protein to open the channel and move the toxin out of the cell. This mechanism uses an energy-dependent, protein-protein interaction that is generated by the transfer of the toxin for an H+ ion by the inner membrane transporter.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ughachukwu P, Unekwe P | title = Efflux pump-mediated resistance in chemotherapy | journal = Annals of Medical and Health Sciences Research | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 191\u20138 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 23439914 | pmc = 3573517 | doi = 10.4103/2141-9248.105671 }}</ref>\n\n=== Function ===\nAlthough antibiotics are the most clinically important substrates of efflux systems, it is probable that most efflux pumps have other natural physiological functions.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season. The Duffer Brothers have said that ''Stranger Things'' is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Series overview ==\n''Stranger Things'' is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the [[United States Department of Energy]], but secretly does experiments into the [[paranormal]] and [[supernatural]], including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate dimension]], \"the Upside Down\".

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title.

Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities. The series stars an ensemble cast including [[Winona Ryder]], [[David Harbour]], [[Finn Wolfhard]], [[Millie Bobby Brown]], [[Gaten Matarazzo]], [[Caleb McLaughlin]], [[Noah Schnapp]], [[Natalia Dyer]], [[Charlie Heaton]], [[Joe Keery]] and [[Cara Buono]].\n\nThe Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside [[supernatural]] elements portrayed with horror, science fiction and childlike sensibilities. Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]]. The series has received [[List of awards and nominations received by Stranger Things|multiple awards and nominations]] including 31 [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nominations, four [[Golden Globe Award]] nominations, a [[British Academy Television Award]] nomination, two [[Directors Guild of America Award]] nominations, three [[Writers Guild of America Award]] nominations, and three [[Grammy Award]] nominations. It has won a [[Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series]], two [[American Film Institute]] awards, a [[Critics' Choice Television Award]], and three [[People's Choice Awards]], among others. In September 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth season.

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film ''[[Red Dawn]]'' came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia.<ref name=\"rs\" /> Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series,<ref name=\"rs\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://frightfind.com/stranger-things-netflix-homage/ |title=Stranger Things is an Homage to the Greats |accessdate=July 26, 2016 |website=FrightFind |date=July 26, 2016}}</ref> crafting it in the realm of [[science fiction]] and [[horror fiction|horror]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/08/22/stranger-things-and-the-get-down-reviews |title=On Television: \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down\" |first=Emily |last=Nassbaum |date=August 22, 2016 |accessdate=February 14, 2017 |website=[[The New Yorker]]}}</ref> Other influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: [[Stephen King]] novels; films produced by [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Wes Craven]],<ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\">{{cite web |url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/fien-print/duffer-brothers-talk-stranger-things-916180 |title=The Duffer Brothers Talk 'Stranger Things' Influences, 'It' Dreams and Netflix Phase 2 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref><ref name=\"screenertv\">{{cite web |url=http://screenertv.com/movies/stranger-things-stephen-king-steven-spielberg-cinematic-influences/ |title=The cinematic influences behind Netflix's 'Stranger Things' |date=July 18, 2016 |work=ScreenerTV}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/07/13/how-netflixs-stranger-things-channels-steven-spielberg-john-carpenter-and-stephen-king/ |title=How Netflix's ''Stranger Things'' Channels Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter and Stephen King |first=Sarene |last=Leeds |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=July 13, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref> and [[Guillermo del Toro]];<ref name=\"daily beast\" /> films such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', and ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand by Me]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"screenertv\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/on-demand/0/stranger-things-all-the-hidden-and-not-so-hidden-references-in-p/stand-by-me/ |title=Stranger Things: all the hidden (and not-so-hidden) movie, TV and book references |website=The Telegraph |date=August 6, 2016 |accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref> Japanese [[anime]] such as ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' and ''[[Elfen Lied]]'';<ref name=\"daily beast\" /><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> and several [[video game]]s including ''[[Silent Hill]]'', ''[[Souls (series)|Dark Souls]]'' and ''[[The Last of Us]]''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Yes, Stranger Things' Upside Down was totally inspired by Silent Hill |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/yes-stranger-things-upside-down-was-totally-inspired-by-silent-hill/ |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Tilly |first=Chris |title=How Silent Hill, Dark Souls and The Last of Us Influenced Stranger Things |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2016/08/26/how-silent-hill-dark-souls-and-the-last-of-us-influenced-stranger-things |work=[[IGN]] |date=August 26, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"hollywoodreporter\" /> The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including ''[[Beyond the Black Rainbow]]'' and ''[[D.A.R.Y.L.]]'', discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series.<ref name=\"hwr montauk\" /> Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thewrap.com/stranger-things-21-80s-relics-weve-spotted-so-far-photos/ |title=''Stranger Things'': 21 '80s Relics We've Spotted So Far |first=Meriah |last=Doty |website=[[TheWrap]] |date=July 21, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.vulture.com/2016/07/stranger-things-film-reference-glossary.html |title=A ''Stranger Things'' Glossary: Every Major Film Reference in the Show, From A\u2013Z |last=Tobias |first=Scott |website=[[Vulture.com]] |date=July 18, 2016 |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://boomhowdy.com/filmtv/stranger-things-influences/ |title=Strange Influences: Our Favorite Movie References From ''Stranger Things'' |first=Tyree |last=Kimber |website=Boomhowdy.com |date=July 26, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.inverse.com/article/18481-netflix-stranger-things-80s-pop-culture-references-spielberg |title=Every '80s Pop Culture References in ''Stranger Things'' |first=Sean |last=Hutchinson |website=[[Inverse (website)|Inverse]] |date=July 19, 2016 |accessdate=July 29, 2016}}</ref>\n\nWith Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach.

movie rating]].

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of [[R/GA]], led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/stranger-things-titles-came-perfectly-retro/ |title=How the Stranger Things Titles Came Out So Perfectly Retro |first=Sean Patrick |last=Ferrell |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;
