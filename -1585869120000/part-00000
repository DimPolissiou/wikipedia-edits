The sets were designed by Ludwig Kainer.\n\n== Plot ==\n\nCount Greven (Bruno de Carli) returns to his old castle after spending several years touring the world. The servants note how the count has changed: he is now withdrawn and fearful. He orders that the doors to the castle be kept locked and no one admitted. When he is left alone in his room, Greven opens a chest he brought from his travels, inside it there is a strange statue that he adds to his vast collection of rare works of art. Several days pass and a worried servant (Bernhard Goetzke) informs the town's minister (Hermann Picha) about his master's melancholia. The old man visits the castle looking to help. The count confesses the minister how, during his stay in India, he had heard of a statue of Buddha that was so beautiful that it made the sick well and the sad joyous; while visiting the temple, he stole the figure and smuggled it back home. The count tells the minister that the temple's priest swore a terrible revenge upon him for his sacrilege, and he has been living in fear of their secret powers ever since. The minister leaves shocked, believing that Greven has gone mad. The count screams in despair that he no longer wants to live, since the agony of suspense is worse than death.\n\nOne night, a turbaned figure does appear on Greven's grounds. The count demands that the Indian priest (Conrad Veidt) kills him right then and there to end his suffering, but the man refuses. He warns that - from that very day - the count will only have seven years to live life to its fullest, after which he will die by the hand of the one who loves him most. The count spends those years seeking out every joy life holds. He throws bacchanalias and hosts gambling parties, but soon these pleasures no longer satisfy him. Looking to obtain fame, Greven researches obsessively a means to cure world hunger, but after succeeding, he capriciously destroys it, all for his amusement. Still looking for fulfillment and meaning, he becomes involved with a young woman (Mechthildis Thein) and revels in the experience of love. He and the young woman are wed.\n\nNevertheless, as the fateful day approaches, he becomes paranoid and terrified once again. Desperate, he decides to leave his castle and travel around the world once again, however he can't depart from his wife and cancels his trip. Greven then takes the statue and throws it into a lake, hoping the curse of the priest goes away with it, only to find it back in his home right after. Trusting no one - he even suspects that will be his wife's hand that will slay him - he shoots himself. The statue is retrieved from Greven's castle and carried back to India in the hands of the mysterious priest.<ref name=screen>''Conrad Veidt on Screen: A Comprehensive Illustrated Filmography'' p.34</ref><ref name=beyond>''Beyond Caligari: The Films of Robert Wiene'' p.40-41</ref>\n\n== Cast ==\n\n* [[Bruno Decarli]] as Count Greven \n* [[Conrad Veidt]] as Indian Priest \n* [[Bernhard Goetzke]] as Manservant\n* [[Hermann Picha]] as The Minister\n* [[Mechthildis Thein]] as Greven's Lover\n\n== Reception ==\n\nThe film was well received by contemporary critics, who praised Wiene's interpretation of psychology and portrayal of paranoia.<ref name=screen/>\n\n== Availability ==\nAs with many of Wiene's lesser known works, ''Fear'' has not been released in any format for home media, making it an obscure and rare film.

Inside the delimited space, nothing was happening or placed other than what was outside of it. The absurd enclosure lasted 54 days on the square. After such a long time, the artist himself contacted city officials. This work was connected to the pointing out the indifference to the use of public space and the unjustifiability of certain restrictions associated with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-v-bourani-graffiti-je-indikator-opustenosti-mista-ale-i-svobody-5183544|title=Epos 257 v Bour\u00e1n\u00ed: Graffiti je indik\u00e1tor opu\u0161t\u011bnosti m\u00edsta, ale i svobody|date=2017-02-13|website=Radio Wave|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=Epic 257 in Demolition: Graffiti is an indicator of the abandonment of place, but also of freedom}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Portrait'' ===\nEpos 257 has also repeatedly devoted himself to [[Billboard|billboards]]. For example, In the Portrait project, which was realized before the Czech presidential elections in 2013, he cut out the giant faces of both the final candidates, smiling at people from their gigantic posters, and then framed them. While he left the remains of the promotional posters lacking the faces of politicians in the original place. Epos installed the framed and glazed representations opposite each other. Shortly after his election, Epos went on to place a gigantic portrait of the winner of the elections Milos Zeman in the [[Czech National Library of Technology|National Technical Library]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/epos-257-umelec-ktery-prodal-zaramovanou-loupez-fl3-/recenze.aspx?c=A140406_103720_pozice_139702|title=Epos 257: Um\u011blec, kter\u00fd prodal zar\u00e1movanou loupe\u017e {{!}} Recenze|date=2014-04-18|website=Lidovky.cz|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nIt was mainly for his \u201cbillboard\u201d projects that Epos 257 was repeatedly associated with breaking the law.

At that time, he put up a fence around space on [[Palack\u00e9ho n\u00e1m\u011bst\u00ed (Praha)|Palackeho Square]] (on which there is an exemption to the law prohibiting public gatherings without notice, and which is therefore referred to as the Czech \u201c[[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]]\u201d), around an area of 50 square meters. Inside the delimited space, nothing was happening or placed other than what was outside of it. The absurd enclosure lasted 54 days on the square. After such a long time, the artist himself contacted city officials. This work was connected to the pointing out the indifference to the use of public space and the unjustifiability of certain restrictions associated with it.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://wave.rozhlas.cz/epos-257-v-bourani-graffiti-je-indikator-opustenosti-mista-ale-i-svobody-5183544|title=Epos 257 v Bour\u00e1n\u00ed: Graffiti je indik\u00e1tor opu\u0161t\u011bnosti m\u00edsta, ale i svobody|date=2017-02-13|website=Radio Wave|language=cs|access-date=2019-09-26|trans-title=Epic 257 in Demolition: Graffiti is an indicator of the abandonment of place, but also of freedom}}</ref>\n\n=== ''Portrait'' ===\nEpos 257 has also repeatedly devoted himself to [[Billboard|billboards]]. For example, In the Portrait project, which was realized before the Czech presidential elections in 2013, he cut out the giant faces of both the final candidates, smiling at people from their gigantic posters, and then framed them. While he left the remains of the promotional posters lacking the faces of politicians in the original place. Epos installed the framed and glazed representations opposite each other. Shortly after his election, Epos went on to place a gigantic portrait of the winner of the elections Milos Zeman in the [[Czech National Library of Technology|National Technical Library]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ceskapozice.lidovky.cz/epos-257-umelec-ktery-prodal-zaramovanou-loupez-fl3-/recenze.aspx?c=A140406_103720_pozice_139702|title=Epos 257: Um\u011blec, kter\u00fd prodal zar\u00e1movanou loupe\u017e {{!}} Recenze|date=2014-04-18|website=Lidovky.cz|access-date=2019-09-26}}</ref>\n\n== Controversies ==\nIt was mainly for his \u201cbillboard\u201d projects that Epos 257 was repeatedly associated with breaking the law.

Although an effort to create a [[planned community]] failed in the early 1970s, Flower Mound's population increased substantially when [[Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport]] opened to the south in 1974. As of the [[2010 United States Census]], the population was 64,699,{{sfn|Census|2010}} reflecting a 28% increase over the 50,702 counted in the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]].{{sfn|Sperling|Sander|2006|p=59}}\n\nFlower Mound's municipal government, operating under a [[Council-manager|council\u2013manager]] system, has invested in a public park system highlighted by an extensive network of trails. The town's public schools comprise part of the [[Lewisville Independent School District]]. With its moderately affluent population and proximity to the [[Dallas\u2013Fort Worth metroplex]], Flower Mound has used a [[smart growth]] system for [[urban planning]], and has recently experienced more rapid [[light industry|light industrial]] growth to match the growing needs of the primarily residential community. In 2012, Flower Mound was ranked at #8 as one of the Best Dallas Suburbs according to ''[[D Magazine]]''.<ref name=\"DMagazine\">{{cite news|title=NORTH TEXAS TOWNS RANKED. WHICH CAME OUT ON TOP?

At first, the group held religious camps for two to three weeks at a time.{{sfn|Cannon|2004|p=7}} By 1854, residents had established the Flower Mound Presbyterian Church southwest of [[Lewisville, Texas|Lewisville]] in an area commonly referred to as \"Long Prairie\".{{sfn|Hervey|2002|p=16}}{{sfn|Greene|1973}} By 1920, the church had 126 members,{{sfn|Thompson|1920}} and the pine-framed building was expanded in 1937.{{sfn|Jordan|1976|p=147}} Early settlers such as Andrew Morriss and David Kirkpatrick are memorialized with street names in the town. The area remained sparsely populated for many decades after its initial settlement.\n\nOn February 25, 1961, the town voted to [[Municipal corporation|incorporate]] to avoid [[Municipal annexation in the United States|annexation]] by the City of [[Irving, Texas|Irving]].{{sfn|FMHC|1995|pp=55&ndash;56}} William Wilkerson, who became the town's second mayor, led the incorporation effort and helped improve the town's phone service and water supply.{{sfn|Ackerman|2006}} In 1970, when Flower Mound had 1,685 residents, Edward S. Marcus and [[Raymond Nasher]] began a [[planned community]] project with $18 million in loan guarantees from the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] through their [[National Urban Policy and New Community Development Act of 1970|New Community]] program.{{sfn|New Town Report|1970|p=1}} Called \"Flower Mound New Town\", the project included elements of the [[new towns movement]], including collaboration with [[University of North Texas|North Texas State University]] (now the University of North Texas) to move the school's administrative offices to Flower Mound and conduct all research for the project.{{sfn|Rogers|2002|p=509}} The project was featured in advertisements as late as 1974,{{sfn|Texas Monthly|1974|p=34}} but it was abandoned after residents threatened to disannex a portion of the town to thwart the development.{{sfn|New Town Report|1970|p=5}}{{sfn|Minor|2011}} The disannexation effort sharply divided the town, and led to a number of strongly contested elections between 1971 and 1976.{{sfn|FMHC|1995|p=63&ndash;66}} In 1976, ''[[Texas Monthly]]'' awarded the project its \"Bum Steer Award\" after the project lost its federal loan guarantees.{{sfn|West|1976|p=73}}\n\nThe construction of [[Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport]] {{convert|4|mi|km}} south of the town in 1974 sparked a period of rapid growth. Between 1980 and 1990, Flower Mound's population increased from 4,402 to 15,896. It reached 50,702 in 2000, an average annual increase of nearly 13 percent per year during the 1990s, making it the nation's tenth fastest-growing community.{{sfn|SMARTgrowth|2012}} Between 2000 and 2002, Flower Mound was the ninth fastest-growing municipality in the United States with a population of more than 50,000, and its population continued to increase by approximately five percent each year between 2000 and 2005. Controlled growth continues in central and western Flower Mound.\n\n==Geography==\nFlower Mound is located approximately {{convert|20|mi}} northwest of [[Dallas, Texas|Dallas]] and {{convert|25|mi|km}} northeast of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]] on the border between [[Denton County, Texas|Denton]] and [[Tarrant County, Texas|Tarrant]] counties. The town is located almost entirely in Denton County, however it has areas that extend into Tarrant County.{{sfn|County Information|2014}} It is situated on the basin of the [[Trinity River (Texas)|Trinity River]] in the [[Cross Timbers#29b: Eastern Cross Timbers|Eastern Cross Timbers]] subregion in Texas.{{sfn|TPWD|2009}} The town borders Lewisville to the east and a number of cities and towns to the north, including [[Highland Village, Texas|Highland Village]], [[Double Oak, Texas|Double Oak]], and [[Bartonville, Texas|Bartonville]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|43.4|sqmi}}.{{sfn|Census|2010}} Land comprises {{convert|41.39|sqmi}} (95.37%) of the total area; Denton County soils include the Silawa, Nawo, Gasil series.{{sfn|Marks|1980|pp=66&ndash;76}} Water comprises {{convert|2.5|sqmi|km2}} (5.76%) of the total area; [[Grapevine Lake]] and Marshall Creek form much of the town's southern boundary. Flower Mound's climate is classified as [[Humid subtropical climate|humid subtropical]]; the city averages 233 sunny days per year and 79 days of precipitation.{{sfn|Sperling|Sander|2006|p=97}}\n\nThe town encourages [[conservation development]] projects to protect and preserve existing [[Open space reserve|open space]], vistas, and [[Habitat (ecology)|natural habitats]] while allowing for controlled growth. Much of the town is located on the [[Barnett Shale]], and drilling for [[Shale gas in the United States|shale gas]] in close proximity to residential neighborhoods has sharply divided parts of the community.{{sfn|Hawes|2010}}{{sfn|Hundley|2010}}{{sfn|Maxwell|2009}} In 1994, amateur fossil collector Gary Byrd discovered a fossilized example of a [[Hadrosaurid]] dinosaur among [[Shale|black shale]] rock formations in the southwest edge of the town near Grapevine Lake.{{sfn|FWMSH|2012}} The fossilized creature from the [[Cenomanian]] age was named \"''[[Protohadros byrdi]]''\" in Byrd's honor.{{sfn|Head|1998|p=713}}\n\n===The Mound===\nFlower Mound was named for a {{convert|12.5|acre|ha|adj=on}} hill approximately {{convert|50|ft|m}} in height located close to the intersection of [[Farm to Market Road 3040|FM 3040]] and FM 2499. The formation attracted the attention of early settlers to the area, and is often simply referred to as \"The Mound\". Part of the [[Texas blackland prairies]], The Mound is typically covered by [[Andropogon gerardi|big bluestem]], [[Schizachyrium scoparium|little bluestem]], and [[Sorghastrum nutans|Indian grasses]].{{sfn|Bowman|2004|pp=101&ndash;103}} During blooming seasons, dozens of varieties of flowers can grow on its slopes, often aided by the water retained by [[gilgai]] formations.{{sfn|Bowman|2004|p=33}} Though surrounded by commercial and residential development, The Mound is owned and maintained by The Mound Foundation, a non-profit private&ndash;public partnership. The group has advocated for a [[controlled burn]] on The Mound for many years,{{sfn|Bowman|2004|p=31}} and it expressed relief when an accidental New Year's Eve fire in late 2011 spurred the growth of wildflowers for the first time in years.{{sfn|Hundley|2012a}}\n\n===Surrounding municipalities===\n{{Geographic location\n|Northwest = [[Justin, Texas|Justin]]\n|North     = [[Double Oak, Texas|Double Oak]]/[[Bartonville, Texas|Bartonville]]\n|Northeast = [[Highland Village, Texas|Highland Village]]\n|West      = [[Roanoke, Texas|Roanoke]]\n|Center    = Flower Mound\n|South     = [[Grapevine, Texas|Grapevine]]\n|Southwest = [[Northlake, Texas|Northlake]]    \n|Southeast = [[Coppell, Texas|Coppell]]\n|East      = [[Lewisville, Texas|Lewisville]]\n|}}\n\n==Government==\nThe Town of Flower Mound has been a [[Home Rule in the United States|home rule]] municipality since 1981, and it has operated under a [[Council-manager|council\u2013manager]] type of municipal government since 1989.{{sfn|Almanac|1996|p=513}} Residents elect five [[at-large]] members to the Flower Mound Town Council and one [[mayor]].

Blueskin was preferred for portraits because of his white [[Equine coat color|hair coat]], as opposed to Nelson's [[Chestnut (coat)|chestnut coat]]. [[Gray (horse)|Grays]] are born darker, but adult hair coat often becomes pure white, and their skin is black, which can appear bluish in sunlight (thus the name).\n\nIt is uncertain whether any contemporary portraitists who painted George Washington with Blueskin had the horse standing as a subject (Peale and Faed certainly did not; Faed had never traveled to America).  These portraits are unlikely accurate representations of Blueskin; rather, pastiches borrowed from other paintings, such as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s equestrian portrait ''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]]''. Judging from the Roman nose and rounded croup with a low tail set illustrated in these paintings, the horse modeled was likely of [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] descent.<ref>Loch, S. 1986.

His ability to command horses conveyed this impression even further, and was described by British officers that \"he was a very impressive figure, both on horseback and off.\"<ref name=\"tripod\">{{cite web |author1=The Accidental Horseman |title=Presidents and Horses: George Washington and Horses Blueskin and Nelson |url=http://hglanham.tripod.com/Horses/horses68.html |website=hglanham.tripod.com |accessdate=19 January 2020}}{{better source|date=January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Portrayals of Blueskin ==\nBlueskin was a favorite of George Washington;<ref name=\"Museum\" /> due to his Arabian bloodline, the horse had \"great endurance and could carry Washington (who was said to be over six feet tall)<ref>See: [[Heights of presidents and presidential candidates of the United States #cite note-12]]</ref> all day on the march or in battle.\"<ref name=\"Horse Nation\">{{cite web |last1=Kovatch |first1=Kristen |title=Nelson and Blueskin: The First Horses of the United States |url=https://www.horsenation.com/2015/02/16/nelson-and-blueskin-the-first-horses-of-the-united-states/ |website=Horse Nation |accessdate=19 January 2020 |date=February 16, 2015}}</ref> However, Washington preferred to ride his other horse, Nelson, in battle since Blueskin was prone to skittishness around gunfire and cannon blasts while Nelson was more composed in those circumstances.<ref name=\"Horse Nation\" /> Though Blueskin did not see as much battle as Nelson, he is the horse who appears most frequently in paintings of George Washington as a general in the Revolution.  Blueskin was preferred for portraits because of his white [[Equine coat color|hair coat]], as opposed to Nelson's [[Chestnut (coat)|chestnut coat]]. [[Gray (horse)|Grays]] are born darker, but adult hair coat often becomes pure white, and their skin is black, which can appear bluish in sunlight (thus the name).\n\nIt is uncertain whether any contemporary portraitists who painted George Washington with Blueskin had the horse standing as a subject (Peale and Faed certainly did not; Faed had never traveled to America).  These portraits are unlikely accurate representations of Blueskin; rather, pastiches borrowed from other paintings, such as [[Jacques-Louis David|David]]'s equestrian portrait ''[[Napoleon Crossing the Alps]]''. Judging from the Roman nose and rounded croup with a low tail set illustrated in these paintings, the horse modeled was likely of [[Andalusian horse|Andalusian]] descent.<ref>Loch, S. 1986.

{"title_page": "Figure of the Earth", "text_new": "{{short description|Size and shape used to model the Earth for geodesy}}\n{{for|the historical development of the concept|Spherical Earth|Flat Earth}}\n{{Geodesy}}\n'''Figure of the Earth''' is a [[Jargon|term of art]] in [[geodesy]] that refers to the size and shape used to model [[Earth]]. The size and shape it refers to depend on context, including the precision needed for the model. The [[Spherical Earth|sphere]] is perfect like everyone in the planets \n the figure of the Earth that is satisfactory for many purposes. Several models with greater accuracy have been developed so that coordinate systems can serve the precise needs of [[navigation]], [[surveying]], [[cadastre]], [[land use]], and various other concerns.\n\n== Motivation ==\nEarth's [[Topography|topographic]] surface is apparent with its variety of land forms and water areas. This topographic surface is generally the concern of topographers, [[Hydrography|hydrographers]], and [[Geophysics|geophysicists]]. While it is the surface on which Earth measurements are made, mathematically modeling it while taking the irregularities into account would be extremely complicated.\n\nThe [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] concept of a [[spherical Earth]] offers a simple surface that is easy to deal with mathematically. Many astronomical and navigational computations use a sphere to model the Earth as a close approximation. However, a more accurate figure is needed for measuring distances and areas on the scale beyond the purely local. Better approximations can be had by modeling the entire surface as an [[oblate spheroid]], using [[spherical harmonic]]s to approximate the [[geoid]], or modeling a region with a best-fit [[reference ellipsoid]]s.\n\nFor surveys of small areas, a planar (flat) model of Earth's surface suffices because the local topography overwhelms the curvature. [[Plane-table]] surveys are made for relatively small areas without considering the size and shape of the entire Earth. A survey of a city, for example, might be conducted this way.\n\nBy the late 1600s, serious effort was devoted to modeling the Earth as an ellipsoid, beginning with [[Jean Picard]]'s measurement of a degree of arc along the [[Paris meridian]]. Improved maps and better measurement of distances and areas of national territories motivated these early attempts. Surveying instrumentation and techniques improved over the ensuing centuries. Models for the figure of the earth improved in step.\n\nIn the mid- to late 20th century, research across the [[Earth science|geosciences]] contributed to drastic improvements in the accuracy of the figure of the Earth. The primary utility of this improved accuracy was to provide geographical and gravitational data for the [[inertial guidance system]]s of [[ballistic missile]]s. This funding also drove the expansion of geoscientific disciplines, fostering the creation and growth of various geoscience departments at many universities.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cloud |first=John |title=Crossing the Olentangy River: The Figure of the Earth and the Military-Industrial-Academic Complex, 1947\u20131972 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=371\u2013404 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(00)00017-4 |bibcode=2000SHPMP..31..371C }}</ref> These developments benefited many civilian pursuits as well, such as weather and communication satellite control and [[GPS]] location-finding, which would be impossible without highly accurate models for the figure of the Earth.\n\n== Models ==\nThe models for the figure of the Earth vary in the way they are used, in their complexity, and in the accuracy with which they represent the size and shape of the Earth.\n\n=== Sphere ===\n{{Main|Spherical earth}}\n{{further|Earth radius|Earth's circumference}}\n[[File:Horizon, Valencia (Spain).JPG|thumb|A view across a 20-km-wide bay in the coast of [[Spain]].

The first scientific estimation of the radius of the Earth was given by [[Eratosthenes]] about 240&nbsp;BC, with estimates of the accuracy of Eratosthenes\u2019s measurement ranging from 2% to 15%.\n\nThe Earth is only approximately spherical, so no single value serves as its natural radius. Distances from points on the surface to the center range from 6,353&nbsp;km to 6,384&nbsp;km (3,947 \u2013 3,968&nbsp;mi). Several different ways of modeling the Earth as a sphere each yield a mean radius of {{convert|6,371|km|mi|sp=us}}. Regardless of the model, any radius falls between the polar minimum of about 6,357&nbsp;km and the equatorial maximum of about 6,378&nbsp;km (3,950 \u2013 3,963&nbsp;mi). The difference {{convert|21|km|mi|sp=us}} correspond to the polar radius being approximately 0.3% shorter than the equator radius.\n\n===Ellipsoid of revolution===\n[[File:OblateSpheroid.PNG|thumb|An [[oblate spheroid]], highly exaggerated relative to the actual Earth]]\n[[File:Earth oblateness to scale.svg|thumb|A scale diagram of the [[flattening|oblateness]] of the 2003 [[IERS]] [[reference ellipsoid]], with north at the top.

The oblate spheroid, or [[oblate ellipsoid]], is an [[ellipsoid of revolution]] obtained by rotating an ellipse about its shorter axis. It is the regular geometric shape that most nearly approximates the shape of the Earth. A spheroid describing the figure of the Earth or other [[celestial body]] is called a [[reference ellipsoid]]. The reference ellipsoid for Earth is called an [[Earth ellipsoid]].\n\nAn ellipsoid of revolution is uniquely defined by two quantities. Several conventions for expressing the two quantities are used in geodesy, but they are all equivalent to and convertible with each other:\n* Equatorial radius <math>a</math> (called ''semimajor axis''), and polar radius <math>b</math> (called ''semiminor axis'');\n* <math>a</math> and [[Eccentricity (mathematics)|eccentricity]] <math>e</math>;\n* <math>a</math> and [[flattening]] <math>f</math>.\nEccentricity and flattening are different ways of expressing how squashed the ellipsoid is. When flattening appears as one of the defining quantities in geodesy, generally it is expressed by its reciprocal. For example, in the [[World Geodetic System#WGS84|WGS 84]] spheroid used by today's GPS systems, the reciprocal of the flattening <math>1/f</math> is set to be exactly {{gaps|298.257|223|563}}.\n\nThe difference between a sphere and a reference ellipsoid for Earth is small, only about one part in 300. Historically, flattening was computed from [[grade measurement]]s. Nowadays, geodetic networks and [[satellite geodesy]] are used. In practice, many reference ellipsoids have been developed over the centuries from different surveys. The flattening value varies slightly from one reference ellipsoid to another, reflecting local conditions and whether the reference ellipsoid is intended to model the entire Earth or only some portion of it.\n\nA sphere has a single [[radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]], which is simply the radius of the sphere. More complex surfaces have radii of curvature that vary over the surface. The radius of curvature describes the radius of the sphere that best approximates the surface at that point. Oblate ellipsoids have constant radius of curvature east to west along [[Parallel (latitude)|parallels]], if a [[Geographic coordinate system|graticule]] is drawn on the surface, but varying curvature in any other direction. For an oblate ellipsoid, the polar radius of curvature <math>r_p</math> is larger than the equatorial\n\n:<math> r_p=\\frac{a^2}{b},</math>\n\nbecause the pole is flattened: the flatter the surface, the larger the sphere must be to approximate it. Conversely, the ellipsoid's north-south radius of curvature at the equator <math>r_e</math> is smaller than the polar\n\n:<math> r_e=\\frac{b^2}{a}</math>\n\nwhere <math>a</math> is the distance from the center of the ellipsoid to the equator (semi-major axis), and <math>b</math> is the distance from the center to the pole. (semi-minor axis)\n\n=== Geoid ===\n{{Main|Geoid}}\nIt was stated earlier that measurements are made on the apparent or topographic surface of the Earth and it has just been explained that computations are performed on an ellipsoid. One other surface is involved in geodetic measurement: the [[geoid]]. In geodetic surveying, the computation of the geodetic coordinates of points is commonly performed on a [[reference ellipsoid]] closely approximating the size and shape of the Earth in the area of the survey. The actual measurements made on the surface of the Earth with certain instruments are however referred to the geoid. The ellipsoid is a mathematically defined regular surface with specific dimensions. The geoid, on the other hand, coincides with that surface to which the oceans would conform over the entire Earth if free to adjust to the combined effect of the Earth's mass attraction ([[gravitation]]) and the centrifugal force of the [[Earth's rotation]]. As a result of the uneven distribution of the Earth's mass, the geoidal surface is irregular and, since the ellipsoid is a regular surface, the separations between the two, referred to as [[geoid undulation]]s, geoid heights, or geoid separations, will be irregular as well.\n\nThe geoid is a surface along which the gravity potential is everywhere equal and to which the direction of gravity is always perpendicular (see [[equipotential surface]]). The latter is particularly important because optical instruments containing gravity-reference leveling devices are commonly used to make geodetic measurements. When properly adjusted, the vertical axis of the instrument coincides with the direction of gravity and is, therefore, perpendicular to the geoid. The angle between the [[plumb line]] which is perpendicular to the geoid (sometimes called \"the vertical\") and the perpendicular to the ellipsoid (sometimes called \"the ellipsoidal normal\") is defined as the [[vertical deflection|deflection of the vertical]]. It has two components: an east-west and a north-south component.<ref name=DMA/>\n\n[[File:Geoid undulation 10k scale.jpg|thumb|Geoid undulation in false color, shaded relief and vertical exaggeration (10000 scale factor).]]\n[[File:Geoid undulation to scale.jpg|thumb|Geoid undulation in false color, to scale.]]\n\n=== Other shapes ===\nThe possibility that the Earth's equator is better characterized as an ellipse rather than a circle and therefore that the ellipsoid is triaxial has been a matter of scientific inquiry for many years.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Is the Earth a triaxial ellipsoid? | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | date=1962 | volume=67 | issue=1 | pages=321\u2013327 | first=W.

The size and shape it refers to depend on context, including the precision needed for the model. The [[Spherical Earth|sphere]] is an approximation of the figure of the Earth that is satisfactory for many purposes. Several models with greater accuracy have been developed so that coordinate systems can serve the precise needs of [[navigation]], [[surveying]], [[cadastre]], [[land use]], and various other concerns.\n\n== Motivation ==\nEarth's [[Topography|topographic]] surface is apparent with its variety of land forms and water areas. This topographic surface is generally the concern of topographers, [[Hydrography|hydrographers]], and [[Geophysics|geophysicists]]. While it is the surface on which Earth measurements are made, mathematically modeling it while taking the irregularities into account would be extremely complicated.\n\nThe [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagorean]] concept of a [[spherical Earth]] offers a simple surface that is easy to deal with mathematically. Many astronomical and navigational computations use a sphere to model the Earth as a close approximation. However, a more accurate figure is needed for measuring distances and areas on the scale beyond the purely local. Better approximations can be had by modeling the entire surface as an [[oblate spheroid]], using [[spherical harmonic]]s to approximate the [[geoid]], or modeling a region with a best-fit [[reference ellipsoid]]s.\n\nFor surveys of small areas, a planar (flat) model of Earth's surface suffices because the local topography overwhelms the curvature. [[Plane-table]] surveys are made for relatively small areas without considering the size and shape of the entire Earth. A survey of a city, for example, might be conducted this way.\n\nBy the late 1600s, serious effort was devoted to modeling the Earth as an ellipsoid, beginning with [[Jean Picard]]'s measurement of a degree of arc along the [[Paris meridian]]. Improved maps and better measurement of distances and areas of national territories motivated these early attempts. Surveying instrumentation and techniques improved over the ensuing centuries. Models for the figure of the earth improved in step.\n\nIn the mid- to late 20th century, research across the [[Earth science|geosciences]] contributed to drastic improvements in the accuracy of the figure of the Earth. The primary utility of this improved accuracy was to provide geographical and gravitational data for the [[inertial guidance system]]s of [[ballistic missile]]s. This funding also drove the expansion of geoscientific disciplines, fostering the creation and growth of various geoscience departments at many universities.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Cloud |first=John |title=Crossing the Olentangy River: The Figure of the Earth and the Military-Industrial-Academic Complex, 1947\u20131972 |journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Modern Physics |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=371\u2013404 |year=2000 |doi=10.1016/S1355-2198(00)00017-4 |bibcode=2000SHPMP..31..371C }}</ref> These developments benefited many civilian pursuits as well, such as weather and communication satellite control and [[GPS]] location-finding, which would be impossible without highly accurate models for the figure of the Earth.\n\n== Models ==\nThe models for the figure of the Earth vary in the way they are used, in their complexity, and in the accuracy with which they represent the size and shape of the Earth.\n\n=== Sphere ===\n{{Main|Spherical earth}}\n{{further|Earth radius|Earth's circumference}}\n[[File:Horizon, Valencia (Spain).JPG|thumb|A view across a 20-km-wide bay in the coast of [[Spain]].

One other surface is involved in geodetic measurement: the [[geoid]]. In geodetic surveying, the computation of the geodetic coordinates of points is commonly performed on a [[reference ellipsoid]] closely approximating the size and shape of the Earth in the area of the survey. The actual measurements made on the surface of the Earth with certain instruments are however referred to the geoid. The ellipsoid is a mathematically defined regular surface with specific dimensions. The geoid, on the other hand, coincides with that surface to which the oceans would conform over the entire Earth if free to adjust to the combined effect of the Earth's mass attraction ([[gravitation]]) and the centrifugal force of the [[Earth's rotation]]. As a result of the uneven distribution of the Earth's mass, the geoidal surface is irregular and, since the ellipsoid is a regular surface, the separations between the two, referred to as [[geoid undulation]]s, geoid heights, or geoid separations, will be irregular as well.\n\nThe geoid is a surface along which the gravity potential is everywhere equal and to which the direction of gravity is always perpendicular (see [[equipotential surface]]). The latter is particularly important because optical instruments containing gravity-reference leveling devices are commonly used to make geodetic measurements. When properly adjusted, the vertical axis of the instrument coincides with the direction of gravity and is, therefore, perpendicular to the geoid. The angle between the [[plumb line]] which is perpendicular to the geoid (sometimes called \"the vertical\") and the perpendicular to the ellipsoid (sometimes called \"the ellipsoidal normal\") is defined as the [[vertical deflection|deflection of the vertical]]. It has two components: an east-west and a north-south component.<ref name=DMA/>\n\n[[File:Geoid undulation 10k scale.jpg|thumb|Geoid undulation in false color, shaded relief and vertical exaggeration (10000 scale factor).]]\n[[File:Geoid undulation to scale.jpg|thumb|Geoid undulation in false color, to scale.]]\n\n=== Other shapes ===\nThe possibility that the Earth's equator is better characterized as an ellipse rather than a circle and therefore that the ellipsoid is triaxial has been a matter of scientific inquiry for many years.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Is the Earth a triaxial ellipsoid? | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research | date=1962 | volume=67 | issue=1 | pages=321\u2013327 | first=W.

A [[city council]] acts as the legislative body, and the council-appointed manager handles the traditional day-to-day chief executive functions.\n\nCity councilors can run as either a representative of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate who receives the greatest number of votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large councilor candidates must ask to be removed from the ballot for mayor if they do not want to be listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, and once as the mayor. The mayor has no more authority than other city councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large and 5 district.\n\nWorcester's first [[charter]], which went into effect in 1848, established a Mayor/[[Bicameralism|Bicameral]] form of government. Together, the two chambers \u2014 the 11-member Board of [[alderman|Aldermen]] and the 30-member Common Council \u2014 were vested with complete legislative powers. The mayor handled all administrative departments, though appointments to those departments had to be approved by the two-chamber City Council.\n\nSeeking to replace the 1848 charter, Worcester voters in November 1947 approved a change to [[Government of Massachusetts#Form of government: city vs. town|Plan E municipal government]]. In effect from January 1949 until November 1985, this charter (as outlined in chapter 43 of the Massachusetts General Laws) established City Council/City Manager government. This type of governance, with modifications, has survived to the present day.\n\nInitially, Plan E government in Worcester was organized as a 9-member council (all at-large), a ceremonial mayor elected from the council by the councilors, and a council-appointed city manager. The manager oversees the daily administration of the city, makes all appointments to city offices, and can be removed at any time by a majority vote of the Council. The mayor chairs the city council and the school committee, and does not have the power to veto any vote.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wrrb.org/reports/99-2charterq.pdf | title=Considering Worcester's Charter | date=April 20, 1999 | publisher=Worcester Regional Research Bureau | accessdate=June 17, 2004|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616175906/http://www.wrrb.org/reports/99-2charterq.pdf |archivedate = June 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1949 through 1959, elections were by the [[single transferable vote]]. Voters repealed that system in November 1960. Despite [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] elections, two groups alternated in control of council: the local Democratic Party and a [[Slate (elections)|slate]] known as the Citizens' Plan E Association (CEA). CEA members included the Republican Party leadership and other groups not affiliated with the regular Democratic Party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Santucci|first=Jack|date=April 2018|title=Evidence of a winning-cohesion tradeoff under multi-winner ranked-choice voting|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=52|pages=128\u2013138|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2017.11.003|issn=0261-3794|url=http://osf.io/qjtwn/}}</ref>\n[[File:WorcesterMA Downtown.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Worcester, with [[Worcester City Hall and Common|City Hall]] (1898) at right]]\n\nIn 1983, Worcester voters again decided to change the city charter. This \"Home Rule\" charter (named for the method of adoption of the charter) is similar to Plan E, the major changes being to the structure of the council and the election of the mayor. The 9-member Council became 11, 6 at-large and 1 from each city district. The mayor is chosen by popular election, but must also run and win as an at-large councilor.\n\n===Politics===\n[[File:Massachusetts Vietnam Memorial-entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Massachusetts Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, erected in 2002]]\n[[File:LincolnSquareWorcesterMApostcard.jpg|thumb|right|Lincoln Square c. 1912]]\nWorcester's history of [[social progressivism]] includes a number of [[temperance movement in Massachusetts|temperance]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movements.

The KKK had hired more than 400 \"husky guards\", but when the rally ended around midnight, a riot broke out. Klansmen's cars were stoned and burned, and their windows smashed. KKK members were pulled from their cars and beaten. Klansmen called for police protection, but the situation raged out of control for most of the night.

The first Catholics came to Worcester in 1826. They were chiefly Irish immigrants brought to America by the builders of the Blackstone canal. As time went on and the number of Catholics increased, the community petitioned Bishop Fenwick to send them a priest. In response to this appeal, the bishop appointed the Reverend James Fitton to visit the Catholics of Worcester in 1834. Catholic mass was first offered in the city in an old stone building on Front Street. The foundation of Christ's Church, the first Catholic church in Worcester (now St. John's), was laid on July 6, 1834.<ref>F.P.

The river courses underground through the center of the city, and emerges at the foot of College Hill. It then flows south through Quinsigamond Village and into Millbury. Worcester is the beginning of the [[Blackstone Valley]] that frames the river. The [[Blackstone Canal]] was once an important waterway connecting Worcester to Providence and the [[East Coast of the United States|Eastern Seaboard]], but the canal fell into disuse at the end of the 19th century and was mostly covered up. In recent years, local organizations, including the Canal District Business Association, have proposed restoring the canal and creating a Blackstone Valley [[National Park]].<ref name=blackstone>{{cite news |first=Steven |last=Jones-D'Agostino |title=Worcester's Canal District Banks On National Park Designation|url=http://www.golocalworcester.com/news/canal-district-boosters-push-for-national-historic-park/ |publisher=GoLocalWorcester|date=September 3, 2013|accessdate=January 2, 2014}}</ref>  In November 2018, the administration of [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] [[Charlie Baker]] announced a $400,000 grant to streetscape improvements in the Canal District.<ref>{{cite web|title=Baker-Polito Administration Announces $400K MassWorks Award for Worcester|website=www.mass.gov|url=https://www.mass.gov/news/baker-polito-administration-announces-400k-massworks-award-for-worcester|date=November 2, 2018|accessdate=December 6, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWorcester is one of many cities claimed, like [[Rome]], [[List of cities claimed to be built on seven hills|to be found on seven hills]]: Airport Hill, Bancroft Hill, Belmont Hill (Bell Hill), [[Grafton Hill]], Green Hill, Pakachoag Hill and Vernon Hill. However, Worcester has more than seven hills including Indian Hill, Newton Hill, Poet's Hill, and Wigwam Hill.\n\nWorcester has many ponds and two prominent lakes: [[Indian Lake (Massachusetts)|Indian Lake]] and [[Lake Quinsigamond]]. Lake Quinsigamond (also known as ''Long Pond'') stretches four miles across the Worcester and Shrewsbury border and is a very popular [[rowing (sport)|competitive rowing]] and boating destination.\n\n===Climate===\nWorcester's [[humid continental climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb'') is typical of [[New England]]. The weather changes rapidly owing to the confluence of warm, humid air from the southwest; cool, dry air from the north; and the moderating influence of the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Summers are typically warm and humid, while winters are cold, windy, and snowy. Snow typically falls from the second half of November into early April,<ref name = NOAA/> with occasional falls in October; May snow is much rarer. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] classifies the city as straddling [[hardiness zone]]s 5b and 6a.<ref>{{vcite web |title=USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |author=United States Department of Agriculture |publisher=[[United States National Arboretum]] |url=http://www.usna.usda.gov/Hardzone/hzm-ne1.html |accessdate=February 19, 2015 |authorlink=United States Department of Agriculture}}</ref>\n\nThe hottest month is July, with a 24-hour average of {{convert|70.2|\u00b0F|1}}, while the coldest is January, at {{convert|24.1|\u00b0F|1}}.

Massachusetts' geographic location, jutting out into the [[North Atlantic]], makes the city very prone to [[Nor'easter]] weather systems that can dump heavy snow on the region.\n\nWhile rare, the city has had its share of extreme weather. On September 21, 1938, the city was hit by the brutal [[New England Hurricane of 1938]]. Fifteen years later, Worcester was hit by a [[1953 Worcester tornado|tornado]] that killed 94 people. The deadliest tornado in New England history, it damaged a large part of the city and surrounding towns. It struck [[Assumption Preparatory School]], now the site of [[Quinsigamond Community College]].\n\n{{Weather box\n| location    = Worcester, Massachusetts (Worcester Regional Airport), 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes 1892\u2013present\n| single line = Y\n| Jan high F = 31.3\n| Feb high F = 34.6\n| Mar high F = 42.9\n| Apr high F = 55.1\n| May high F = 65.9\n| Jun high F = 74.1\n| Jul high F = 78.9\n| Aug high F = 77.3\n| Sep high F = 69.6\n| Oct high F = 58.3\n| Nov high F = 47.6\n| Dec high F = 36.3\n| year high F= 56.0\n| Jan low F = 16.8\n| Feb low F = 19.4\n| Mar low F = 26.5\n| Apr low F = 37.0\n| May low F = 46.8\n| Jun low F = 56.0\n| Jul low F = 61.5\n| Aug low F = 60.4\n| Sep low F = 52.9\n| Oct low F = 41.7\n| Nov low F = 33.0\n| Dec low F = 22.6\n| year low F= 39.6\n|Jan avg record high F =52.9\n|Feb avg record high F =53.8\n|Mar avg record high F =66.3\n|Apr avg record high F =78.2\n|May avg record high F =84.1\n|Jun avg record high F =87.5\n|Jul avg record high F =89.5\n|Aug avg record high F =88.1\n|Sep avg record high F =83.7\n|Oct avg record high F =74.7\n|Nov avg record high F =66.7\n|Dec avg record high F =56.7\n|year avg record high F=91.2\n|Jan avg record low F = \u22122.3\n|Feb avg record low F =  1.5\n|Mar avg record low F =  8.1\n|Apr avg record low F = 24.4\n|May avg record low F = 35.6\n|Jun avg record low F = 44.1\n|Jul avg record low F = 52.3\n|Aug avg record low F = 49.7\n|Sep avg record low F = 39.2\n|Oct avg record low F = 28.6\n|Nov avg record low F = 17.6\n|Dec avg record low F =  4.3\n|year avg record low F= \u22124.6\n| Jan record high F = 67\n| Feb record high F = 71\n| Mar record high F = 84\n| Apr record high F = 91\n| May record high F = 94\n| Jun record high F = 98\n| Jul record high F =102\n| Aug record high F = 99\n| Sep record high F = 99\n| Oct record high F = 91\n| Nov record high F = 79\n| Dec record high F = 72\n\n| Jan record low F = \u221219\n| Feb record low F = \u221224\n| Mar record low F =  \u22126\n| Apr record low F =   9\n| May record low F =  27\n| Jun record low F =  33\n| Jul record low F =  41\n| Aug record low F =  38\n| Sep record low F =  27\n| Oct record low F =  19\n| Nov record low F =   3\n| Dec record low F = \u221217\n| precipitation colour = green\n| Jan precipitation inch = 3.49\n| Feb precipitation inch = 3.23\n| Mar precipitation inch = 4.21\n| Apr precipitation inch = 4.11\n| May precipitation inch = 4.19\n| Jun precipitation inch = 4.19\n| Jul precipitation inch = 4.23\n| Aug precipitation inch = 3.71\n| Sep precipitation inch = 3.93\n| Oct precipitation inch = 4.68\n| Nov precipitation inch = 4.28\n| Dec precipitation inch = 3.82\n| year precipitation inch =\n| Jul snow inch = 0\n| Aug snow inch = 0\n| Sep snow inch = 0\n| Oct snow inch = 0.2\n| Nov snow inch = 2.6\n| Dec snow inch = 14.4\n| Jan snow inch  = 17.1\n| Feb snow inch  = 15.6\n| Mar snow inch  = 11.4\n| Apr snow inch  = 2.8\n| May snow inch  = trace\n| Jun snow inch  = 0\n| year snow inch = 64.1\n| unit precipitation days = 0.01 in\n| Jan precipitation days = 12.5\n| Feb precipitation days = 10.5\n| Mar precipitation days = 12.9\n| Apr precipitation days = 12.4\n| May precipitation days = 13.6\n| Jun precipitation days = 12.3\n| Jul precipitation days = 10.9\n| Aug precipitation days = 10.1\n| Sep precipitation days = 9.9\n| Oct precipitation days = 10.5\n| Nov precipitation days = 11.6\n| Dec precipitation days = 12.2\n| unit snow days = 0.1 in\n| Jul snow days = 0\n| Aug snow days = 0\n| Sep snow days = 0\n| Oct snow days = 0.2\n| Nov snow days = 1.4\n| Dec snow days = 7.0\n| Jan snow days = 8.5\n| Feb snow days = 7.0\n| Mar snow days = 6.0\n| Apr snow days = 1.6\n| May snow days = 0\n| Jun snow days = 0\n| source 1      = NOAA<ref name= NOAA>\n  {{cite web\n  |url = http://www.nws.noaa.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=box\n  |title = NowData \u2013 NOAA Online Weather Data\n  |publisher = [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]\n  |accessdate = 2018-02-22}}</ref><ref name = Extremes>{{cite web\n| url = http://threadex.rcc-acis.org/\n| title = Threaded Extremes\n| accessdate = November 9, 2010\n}}</ref><ref name=\"NOAA KORH\">{{cite web |url=ftp://ftp.ncdc.noaa.gov/pub/data/normals/1981-2010/products/station/USW00094746.normals.txt |publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration |title=Station Name: MA WORCESTER RGNL AP |accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref>\n| date          = April 2014}}\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n{{Main|Neighborhoods in Worcester, Massachusetts}}\n\n===Gallery===\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Worcester Massachusetts.jpg|Worcester and the surrounding areas in 2006, looking north from 3700 feet (1128 m).

A [[city council]] acts as the legislative body, and the council-appointed manager handles the traditional day-to-day chief executive functions.\n\nCity councilors can run as either a representative of a city district or as an at-large candidate. The winning at-large candidate who receives the greatest number of votes for mayor becomes the mayor (at-large councilor candidates must ask to be removed from the ballot for mayor if they do not want to be listed on the mayoral ballot). As a result, voters must vote for their mayoral candidate twice, once as an at-large councilor, and once as the mayor. The mayor has no more authority than other city councilors, but is the ceremonial head of the city and chair of the city council and school committee. Currently, there are 11 councilors: 6 at-large and 5 district.\n\nWorcester's first [[charter]], which went into effect in 1848, established a Mayor/[[Bicameralism|Bicameral]] form of government. Together, the two chambers \u2014 the 11-member Board of [[alderman|Aldermen]] and the 30-member Common Council \u2014 were vested with complete legislative powers. The mayor handled all administrative departments, though appointments to those departments had to be approved by the two-chamber City Council.\n\nSeeking to replace the 1848 charter, Worcester voters in November 1947 approved a change to [[Government of Massachusetts#Form of government: city vs. town|Plan E municipal government]]. In effect from January 1949 until November 1985, this charter (as outlined in chapter 43 of the Massachusetts General Laws) established City Council/City Manager government. This type of governance, with modifications, has survived to the present day.\n\nInitially, Plan E government in Worcester was organized as a 9-member council (all at-large), a ceremonial mayor elected from the council by the councilors, and a council-appointed city manager. The manager oversees the daily administration of the city, makes all appointments to city offices, and can be removed at any time by a majority vote of the Council. The mayor chairs the city council and the school committee, and does not have the power to veto any vote.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.wrrb.org/reports/99-2charterq.pdf | title=Considering Worcester's Charter | date=April 20, 1999 | publisher=Worcester Regional Research Bureau | accessdate=June 17, 2004|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070616175906/http://www.wrrb.org/reports/99-2charterq.pdf |archivedate = June 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\nFrom 1949 through 1959, elections were by the [[single transferable vote]]. Voters repealed that system in November 1960. Despite [[Nonpartisanism|non-partisan]] elections, two groups alternated in control of council: the local Democratic Party and a [[Slate (elections)|slate]] known as the Citizens' Plan E Association (CEA). CEA members included the Republican Party leadership and other groups not affiliated with the regular Democratic Party.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Santucci|first=Jack|date=April 2018|title=Evidence of a winning-cohesion tradeoff under multi-winner ranked-choice voting|journal=Electoral Studies|volume=52|pages=128\u2013138|doi=10.1016/j.electstud.2017.11.003|issn=0261-3794|url=http://osf.io/qjtwn/}}</ref>\n[[File:WorcesterMA Downtown.jpg|thumb|right|Downtown Worcester, with [[Worcester City Hall and Common|City Hall]] (1898) at right]]\n\nIn 1983, Worcester voters again decided to change the city charter. This \"Home Rule\" charter (named for the method of adoption of the charter) is similar to Plan E, the major changes being to the structure of the council and the election of the mayor. The 9-member Council became 11, 6 at-large and 1 from each city district. The mayor is chosen by popular election, but must also run and win as an at-large councilor.\n\n===Politics===\n[[File:Massachusetts Vietnam Memorial-entrance.jpg|thumb|right|Massachusetts Vietnam Veterans' Memorial, erected in 2002]]\n[[File:LincolnSquareWorcesterMApostcard.jpg|thumb|right|Lincoln Square c. 1912]]\nWorcester's history of [[social progressivism]] includes a number of [[temperance movement in Massachusetts|temperance]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movements.

Foster, adopted Worcester as their home, as did [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], the editor of ''The Atlantic Monthly'' and [[Emily Dickinson]]'s avuncular correspondent, and Unitarian minister Rev. [[Edward Everett Hale]].\n\nThe area was already home to [[Lucy Stone]], [[Eli Thayer]], and [[Samuel May, Jr]].

More boating clubs and races followed, and soon many colleges (local, national, and international) held regattas, such as the [[Eastern Sprints]], on the lake. Beginning in 1895, local high schools held crew races on the lake. In 1952, the lake played host to the National Olympic rowing trials.\n\nIn 2002, the Jesse Burkett Little League all-stars team went all the way to the [[Little League World Series]].

The first Catholics came to Worcester in 1826. They were chiefly Irish immigrants brought to America by the builders of the Blackstone canal. As time went on and the number of Catholics increased, the community petitioned Bishop Fenwick to send them a priest. In response to this appeal, the bishop appointed the Reverend James Fitton to visit the Catholics of Worcester in 1834. Catholic mass was first offered in the city in an old stone building on Front Street. The foundation of Christ's Church, the first Catholic church in Worcester (now St. John's), was laid on July 6, 1834.<ref>F.P.
