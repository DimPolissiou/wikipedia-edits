The Taguig River, a tributary of the [[Pasig River]], cuts through the northern half of the city while the Napindan River, another tributary of the Pasig, forms the common border of Taguig with Pasig.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence they were referred to as \"''mga taga-giik'',\" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"rice thresher\") and the settlement as \"''pook ng mga taga-giik''.\" Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] who crossed [[Pasig River]] to reach the city's present site in 1571, found \"taga-giik\" difficult to pronounce. \"Tagui-ig\" was later shortened to its current form \"Taguig\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/our-city/history/|title=History|website=Official Website of The City of Taguig|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the [[Spaniards]] came, Taguig was a part of [[Namayan]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] ruled by [[Lakandula]]. There were also accounts that [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements were once present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nTaguig was one of the earliest known territories to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1571. Between the years 1582 and 1583, Taguig was part of the encomienda of Tondo headed by an alcalde mayor, Captain Vergara. It was in 1587 when Taguig was established as a separate \"[[pueblo]]\" (town) of the then province of [[Manila]]. Captain Juan Basi was its Kapitan from 1587 to 1588. According to records, Taguig had nine (9) barrios then namely, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy, Palingon, Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan, Ususan, and Wawa. Records show that Tipas had once petitioned to become an independent town but was denied by the Spanish government.\n\nDuring that time, Taguig was accessible via the [[Pasig River]], which was connected to two large bodies of water, the [[Manila Bay]] and [[Laguna de Bay]]. The population then was estimated to be 800 tributes. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and \"sawali\" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. During that early period of Spanish colonization. Don Juan Basi, \"Kapitan\" of Taguig from 1587 to 1588, took part in the [[Tondo Conspiracy]], an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. When the [[Katipunan]] was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898.\n\nDuring the [[United States|American]] occupation, they struggled against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1898, Filipino forces including Taguig \"revolutionarios\" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] and [[Fort Bonifacio]]. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.\n\nThe defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Meritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act. No. 137 on June 11, 1901. On October 12, 1903, Taguig, [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was segregated from it and made part of [[Bi\u00f1an]] when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. However it was returned to Taguig on March 22, 1905 with the promulgation Act. No. 1308. On February 29, 1908, Taguig was again declared an independent municipality through Executive Order No. 20. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig and both became independent municipalities of Rizal province on January 1, 1918.\n\nIt was also during the American Colonial Period that the US government acquired a 25.78&nbsp;km\u00b2 property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort McKinley (named after [[William McKinley]], 25th president of the U.S.). When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. They occupied the military camp until the end of the war in 1945. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the [[United States]] on July 4, 1946, the US surrendered the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, [[Fort William McKinley]] was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]] after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio.\n\nThe town's political subdivision was changed to barangays following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) in the 1970s when the country was under [[Martial Law]]. The IRP has increased its subdivisions into 18 barangays, namely, Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to form the [[National Capital Region]] through Presidential Decree No. 824.\n\nIn 1998, a bill was passed in Congress pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite in April showed that the citizens were against cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and the Supreme Court on February 19, 2004 ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city (21,105 'yes' and 19,460 'no'). Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004. In 2008, the City Council created 10 new barangays, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. Hence, in December 2008, after a successful plebiscite, the numbers of barangays in the city increased from 10 to 28 barangays. The 10 newly created barangays were Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag.\n\nIn 2011, doing 424th foundation day of Taguig, former Mayor (now Congresswoman) Lani Cayetano takes pride in calling the city a \u201cProbinSyudad\u201d because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city, yet has the feel and relaxing atmosphere of a province plus its people exude the values and magandang asal of the probinsyano, what with its more than 10 kilometers of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of pagtutulungan is still very much alive.\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Taguig\n| 1903 = 6829\n| 1918 = 8423\n| 1939 = 12087\n| 1948 = 15340\n| 1960 = 21856\n| 1970 = 55257\n| 1975 = 73702\n| 1980 = 134137\n| 1990 = 266637\n| 1995 = 381350\n| 2000 = 467375\n| 2007 = 613343\n| 2010 = 644473\n| 2015 = 804915\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\n==Local government==\n{{See also|Cities of the Philippines}}\nLike other cities in the Philippines, Taguig is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms.

The Taguig River, a tributary of the [[Pasig River]], cuts through the northern half of the city while the Napindan River, another tributary of the Pasig, forms the common border of Taguig with Pasig.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe original farmer-fishermen of the area, about 800 in number, were good at threshing rice after harvest. Hence they were referred to as \"''mga taga-giik'',\" ([[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] for \"rice thresher\") and the settlement as \"''pook ng mga taga-giik''.\" Spanish friar Fray Alonso de Alvarado, together with conquistador [[Ruy L\u00f3pez de Villalobos]] who crossed [[Pasig River]] to reach the city's present site in 1571, found \"taga-giik\" difficult to pronounce. \"Tagui-ig\" was later shortened to its current form \"Taguig\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.taguig.gov.ph/our-city/history/|title=History|website=Official Website of The City of Taguig|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nBefore the [[Spaniards]] came, Taguig was a part of [[Namayan]] and [[Tondo (historical polity)|Tondo]] ruled by [[Lakandula]]. There were also accounts that [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] settlements were once present in the area as revealed by the recent archaeological diggings of various artifacts like cups, plates and other utensils, which bear Chinese characters. This was believed to have originated from China's [[Ming dynasty]].\n\nTaguig was one of the earliest known territories to have been Christianized when the Spaniards succeeded in subjugating mainland Luzon through the [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi|Legazpi]] expedition in 1571. Between the years 1582 and 1583, Taguig was part of the encomienda of Tondo headed by an alcalde mayor, Captain Vergara. It was in 1587 when Taguig was established as a separate \"[[pueblo]]\" (town) of the then province of [[Manila]]. Captain Juan Basi was its Kapitan from 1587 to 1588. According to records, Taguig had nine (9) barrios then namely, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Hagonoy, Palingon, Santa Ana, Tipas, Tuktukan, Ususan, and Wawa. Records show that Tipas had once petitioned to become an independent town but was denied by the Spanish government.\n\nDuring that time, Taguig was accessible via the [[Pasig River]], which was connected to two large bodies of water, the [[Manila Bay]] and [[Laguna de Bay]]. The population then was estimated to be 800 tributes. The town produced more than enough rice for consumption but had less sugar cane to mill. The men lived through fishing while women wove cotton cloth and \"sawali\" from bamboo strips. The people of Taguig were known to have resisted both Spanish and American colonial rule. During that early period of Spanish colonization. Don Juan Basi, \"Kapitan\" of Taguig from 1587 to 1588, took part in the [[Tondo Conspiracy]], an attempt to overthrow the Spanish government which failed. Basi was exiled for two years as punishment. When the [[Katipunan]] was on its early years, many from Taguig became followers and later joined the uprising. The people of Taguig also joined the revolutionary government of General Emilio Aguinaldo on August 6, 1898.\n\nDuring the [[United States|American]] occupation, they struggled against the forces of General Wheaton under the command of General Pio del Pilar. It was recorded that on February 6, 1898, Filipino forces including Taguig \"revolutionarios\" dislodged an American position in the hills of Taguig, now a portion of [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] and [[Fort Bonifacio]]. They were defeated eventually by the Americans with superiority in the armaments and training. Taguig finally fell to the contingent of the First Washington Volunteer Infantry led by Col. Wholly.\n\nThe defeat of the Filipinos after two years of struggle against the American forces subsequently subjected the Philippines to another system of governance. On August 14, 1898, United States occupied the islands and established a military government with General Wesley Meritt as the First Military Governor. He exercised legislative powers until September 1, 1900. At the start of American occupation, Taguig was proclaimed as an independent municipality with the promulgation of General Order No. 4 on March 29, 1900. The town was subsequently incorporated to the newly created province of Rizal when the Philippine Commission promulgated Act. No. 137 on June 11, 1901. On October 12, 1903, Taguig, [[Muntinlupa]] and [[Pateros, Metro Manila|Pateros]] were merged by the virtue of Act. No. 942 with Pateros hosting the seat of the municipal government. The merger did not last long as a month later Muntinlupa was segregated from it and made part of [[Bi\u00f1an]] when Act. No. 1008 was enacted on November 25, 1903. However it was returned to Taguig on March 22, 1905 with the promulgation Act. No. 1308. On February 29, 1908, Taguig was again declared an independent municipality through Executive Order No. 20. Eventually, Pateros separated from Taguig and both became independent municipalities of Rizal province on January 1, 1918.\n\nIt was also during the American Colonial Period that the US government acquired a 25.78&nbsp;km\u00b2 property of Taguig for military purposes. This large piece of land, which had a TCT dated 1902, was turned into a camp that became known as Fort McKinley (named after [[William McKinley]], 25th president of the U.S.). When the Japanese occupied the Philippines in 1942, Fort McKinley was taken over by the [[Japanese Imperial Army]]. They occupied the military camp until the end of the war in 1945. After the Philippines gained its political independence from the [[United States]] on July 4, 1946, the US surrendered the Republic of the Philippines all right of possession, jurisdiction, supervision and control over the Philippine territory except the use of the military bases. On May 14, 1949, [[Fort William McKinley]] was turned over to the Philippine government by virtue of the US Embassy Note No. 0570. Fort McKinley was made the permanent headquarters of the Philippine Army in 1957 and was subsequently renamed [[Fort Bonifacio]] after the Father of the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Andres Bonifacio.\n\nThe town's political subdivision was changed to barangays following the nationwide implementation of the Integrated Reorganization Plan (IRP) in the 1970s when the country was under [[Martial Law]]. The IRP has increased its subdivisions into 18 barangays, namely, Bagong Tanyag, Bagumbayan, Bambang, Calzada, Hagonoy, Ibayo-Tipas, Ligid-Tipas, Lower Bicutan, Maharlika, Napindan, Palingon, Signal Village, Santa Ana, Tuktukan, Upper Bicutan, Ususan, Wawa, and Western Bicutan. On November 7, 1975, Taguig seceded from the province of Rizal to form the [[National Capital Region]] through Presidential Decree No. 824.\n\nIn 1998, a bill was passed in Congress pushing for the cityhood of Taguig. The resulting plebiscite in April showed that the citizens were against cityhood. A recent petition to the Supreme Court sought a recount of the plebiscite and the Supreme Court on February 19, 2004 ordered the Commission on Elections to conduct a recount. The recount showed that the residents did want the municipality of Taguig to become a city (21,105 'yes' and 19,460 'no'). Subsequently, Taguig became a city on December 8, 2004. In 2008, the City Council created 10 new barangays, carving them out from the initial 18 barangays. Hence, in December 2008, after a successful plebiscite, the numbers of barangays in the city increased from 10 to 28 barangays. The 10 newly created barangays were Central Bicutan, New Lower Bicutan, Fort Bonifacio, Katuparan, North Signal Village, South Signal Village, South Daanghari, North Daanghari, Pinagsama, San Miguel, and Tanyag.\n\nIn 2011, doing 424th foundation day of Taguig, former Mayor (now Congresswoman) Lani Cayetano takes pride in calling the city a \u201cProbinSyudad\u201d because it is the only remaining city in Metro Manila which has the amenities of a highly urbanized city, yet has the feel and relaxing atmosphere of a province plus its people exude the values and magandang asal of the probinsyano, what with its more than 10 kilometers of lakeshore, with farmers, fishermen, old churches, a historic lighthouse, and with people whose virtue of pagtutulungan is still very much alive.\n\nIn 2020, the city and the entire metropolitan Manila was placed under community [[quarantine]] for one month starting March 15 due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Metro Manila|2020 coronavirus pandemic]].\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Philippine Census\n| cols = 2\n| align= none\n| title= Population census of Taguig\n| 1903 = 6829\n| 1918 = 8423\n| 1939 = 12087\n| 1948 = 15340\n| 1960 = 21856\n| 1970 = 55257\n| 1975 = 73702\n| 1980 = 134137\n| 1990 = 266637\n| 1995 = 381350\n| 2000 = 467375\n| 2007 = 613343\n| 2010 = 644473\n| 2015 = 804915\n| 2020 =\n| 2025 =\n| 2030 =\n| footnote= Source: [[Philippine Statistics Authority]]{{PH census|2015}}{{PH census|2010}}{{PH census|2007}}{{LWUA population data}}\n}}\n\n==Local government==\n{{See also|Cities of the Philippines}}\nLike other cities in the Philippines, Taguig is governed by a mayor and vice mayor who are elected to three-year terms.

During Web 1.0, server performance and bandwidth had to be considered\u2014lengthy comment threads on multiple pages could potentially slow down an entire site.

It will [...] appear on your computer screen, [...] on your TV set [...] your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven.\n}}\nWriting when [[Palm Inc.]] introduced its first web-capable [[personal digital assistant]] (supporting Web access with [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]), DiNucci saw the Web \"fragmenting\" into a future that extended beyond the browser/PC combination it was identified with. She focused on how the basic information structure and hyper-linking mechanism introduced by [[HTTP]] would be used by a variety of devices and platforms. As such, her \"2.0\" designation refers to the next version of the Web that does not directly relate to the term's current use.\n\nThe term Web 2.0 did not resurface until 2002.<ref>Idehen, Kingsley. 2003.

The year of Web services. CIO, December 15.</ref> Kinsley and Eric focus on the concepts currently associated with the term where, as Scott Dietzen puts it, \"the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration platform\".<ref name=\"Knorr, Eric 2003\"/> In 2004, the term began to popularize when O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, [[John Battelle]] and Tim O'Reilly outlined their definition of the \"Web as Platform\", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that \"customers are building your business for you\".<ref name=\"O'Reilly, Tim 2004\">O'Reilly, Tim, and John Battelle. 2004. Opening Welcome: State of the Internet Industry. In San Francisco, California, October 5.</ref> They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be \"harnessed\" to create value. O'Reilly and Battelle contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called \"Web 1.0\". They associated this term with the business models of [[Netscape]] and the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]. For example,\n{{quote|Netscape framed \"the web as platform\" in terms of the old software [[paradigm]]: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the \"horseless carriage\" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a \"webtop\" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.<ref>O\u2019Reilly, T., 2005.</ref>}} In short, Netscape focused on creating software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing it to the end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with [[Google]], a company that did not, at the time, focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data, such as the links that Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web searches based on reputation through its \"[[PageRank]]\" algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called \"the [[perpetual beta]]\". A similar difference can be seen between the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] and [[Wikipedia]] \u2013 while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and release them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in the subjects in which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the [[Open-source software|open source]] software adage [[Linus' Law|\"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\"]]. This maxim is stating that if enough users are able to look at a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be able to fix any \"[[Bug (computing)|bugs]]\" or other problems. The Wikipedia volunteer editor community produces, edits, and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting [[entrepreneur]]s, representatives from large companies, tech experts and technology reporters.\n\nThe popularity of Web 2.0 was acknowledged by [[You (Time Person of the Year)|2006 ''TIME magazine'' Person of The Year]] (''You'').<ref>Grossman, Lev. 2006.

By increasing emphasis on these already-extant capabilities, they encourage users to rely more on their browser for [[user interface]], [[application software]] (\"apps\") and [[file storage]] facilities. This has been called \"network as platform\" computing.<ref name=\"oreilly\" /> Major features of Web 2.0 include [[social networking]] websites, self-publishing platforms (e.g., [[WordPress]]' easy-to-use blog and website creation tools), [[Tag (metadata)|\"tagging\"]] (which enables users to label websites, videos or photos in some fashion), [[Like button|\"like\" buttons]] (which enable a user to indicate that they are pleased by online content), and [[social bookmarking]].  \n\nUsers can provide the data and exercise some control over what they share on a Web 2.0 site.<ref name=\"oreilly\" /><ref name=\"hinchcliffe\">{{cite web\n|url=http://web2.wsj2.com/the_state_of_web_20.htm\n|title=The State of Web 2.0\n|publisher=Web Services\n|first = Dion | last = Hinchcliffe\n|date=2006-04-02\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515032339/http://web2.wsj2.com/the_state_of_web_20.htm\n|archivedate=2007-05-15\n|accessdate=2006-08-06\n}}</ref> These sites may have an \"architecture of participation\" that encourages users to add value to the application as they use it.<ref name=\"graham\" /><ref name=\"oreilly\" /> Users can add value in many ways, such as by commenting on news stories on a news website, by uploading a relevant photo on a travel website, or by adding a link to a video or [[TED talk]] which is pertinent to the subject being discussed on a website.

Site users also typically create [[user-generated content]] for others to see (e.g., [[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia that anyone can write articles for or edit)\n# [[Software as a service]] (SaaS) \u2013 Web 2.0 sites developed [[API]]s to allow automated usage, such as by a [[Web app|Web \"app\"]] ([[software application]]) or a [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]\n# [[Eternal September|Mass participation]] \u2013 near-universal web access leads to differentiation of concerns, from the traditional Internet user base (who tended to be [[hacker]]s and computer hobbyists) to a wider variety of users\nCompared to web 1.0,[https://www.onlinefraudhelp.com/2020/04/what-is-social-media-web-2.0.html web 2.0] was published with advanced facility and it had read and write facility.the search is based on the keyword.social web is also called due to the interaction capability. Websites with interaction  capabilityes.read write web,socialweb,blog,wiki,social-media and video streaming got popularity.\n\n==Technologies==\nThe [[client-side]] ([[Web browser]]) technologies used in Web 2.0 development include [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] and [[JavaScript library|JavaScript frameworks]]. Ajax programming uses [[JavaScript]] and the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) to update selected regions of the page area without undergoing a full page reload. To allow users to continue interacting with the page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page ([[Asynchronous communication|asynchronously]]). \n\nOtherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases the overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in [[XML]] or [[JSON]] (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used [[structured data]] formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. \n\nWhen this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, [[Google Docs]] uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.\n\nAs a widely available plug-in independent of [[W3C]] standards (the World Wide Web Consortium is the governing body of Web standards and protocols), [[Adobe Flash]] is capable of doing many things that were not possible pre-[[HTML5]]. Of Flash's many capabilities, the most commonly used is its ability to integrate streaming multimedia into HTML pages. With the introduction of HTML5 in 2010 and the growing concerns with Flash's security, the role of Flash is decreasing. \n\nIn addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks use the same technology as JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. However, frameworks smooth over inconsistencies between Web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated '[[Software widget|widgets]]' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel. \n\nOn the [[Server side|server-side]], Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. Languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], as well as [[J2EE|Enterprise Java (J2EE)]] and [[.NET Framework|Microsoft.NET Framework]], are used by developers to output data dynamically using information from files and databases. This allows websites and web services to share [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] formats such as [[XML]] ([[Atom (standard)|Atom]], [[RSS]], etc.) and [[JSON]]. When data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|integrate a portion of that site's functionality]].\n\n==Concepts==\n[[File:Qualitydimensions.png|thumb|alt=Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, encyclopedias and Wikipedia|Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] and [[Wikipedia]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=W\u0142odzimierz |last2=W\u0119cel |first2=Krzysztof |last3=Abramowicz |first3=Witold |date=2019 |title=Multilingual Ranking of Wikipedia Articles with Quality and Popularity Assessment in Different Topics |journal=Computers |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=60 |doi=10.3390/computers8030060 |doi-access=free }}</ref>]]\nWeb 2.0 can be described in three parts:\n* [[Rich Internet application]] (RIA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines the experience brought from desktop to browser, whether it is \"rich\" from a graphical point of view or a usability/interactivity or features point of view.\n* [[Web-oriented architecture]] (WOA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 applications expose their functionality so that other applications can leverage and integrate the functionality providing a set of much richer applications. Examples are [[Web feed|feeds]], [[RSS feed]]s, [[web services]], [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].\n* [[Social Web]]&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 websites tend to interact much more with the end user and make the end user an integral part of the website, either by adding his or her profile, adding comments on content, uploading new content, or adding [[user-generated content]] (e.g., personal [[digital photo]]s).\n\nAs such, Web 2.0 draws together the capabilities of [[Client (computing)|client]]- and [[Server (computing)|server]]-side software, [[content syndication]] and the use of [[List of network protocols|network protocols]]. Standards-oriented Web browsers may use [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] and software extensions to handle the content and user interactions. Web 2.0 sites provide users with [[Computer data storage|information storage]], creation, and dissemination capabilities that were not possible in the environment known as \"Web 1.0\".\n\nWeb 2.0 sites include the following features and techniques, referred to as the acronym [[SLATES]] by Andrew McAfee:<ref>McAfee, A.

For example, in the Talis white paper \"Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation\", [[Paul Miller (journalist)|Paul Miller]] argues\n\n<blockquote>Blogs, wikis and RSS are often held up as exemplary manifestations of Web 2.0. A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, in the case of the wiki, to edit the content. This is what we call the Read/Write web. Talis believes that [[Library 2.0]] means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloging efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.<ref>Miller 10\u201311</ref></blockquote>\n\nHere, Miller links Web 2.0 technologies and the culture of participation that they engender to the field of library science, supporting his claim that there is now a \"Library 2.0\". Many of the other proponents of new 2.0s mentioned here use similar methods. The meaning of Web 2.0 is role dependent. For example, some use Web 2.0 to establish and maintain relationships through social networks, while some marketing managers might use this promising technology to \"end-run traditionally unresponsive I.T. department[s].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |title=i-Technology Viewpoint: It's Time to Take the Quotation Marks Off \"Web 2.0\" &#124; Web 2.0 Journal |publisher=Web2.sys-con.com |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216062850/http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |archive-date=2011-02-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\nThere is a debate over the use of Web 2.0 technologies in mainstream education.

Among other things, company employees have created wikis\u2014Web sites that allow users to add, delete, and edit content&nbsp;\u2014 to list answers to frequently asked questions about each product, and consumers have added significant contributions. \n\nAnother marketing Web 2.0 lure is to make sure consumers can use the online community to network among themselves on topics of their own choosing.<ref>\n{{cite news | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | title=The Secrets of Marketing in a Web 2.0 World | last=Parise | first=Salvatore | newspaper=The Wall Street Journal | date=2008-12-16 | access-date=2017-08-08 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170710043624/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB122884677205091919 | archive-date=2017-07-10 | url-status=live }}\n</ref> Mainstream media usage of Web 2.0 is increasing.

The brand of tourist destinations can be built through marketing campaigns on social media and by engaging with customers. For example, the \u201cSnow at First Sight\u201d campaign launched by the [[Colorado|State of Colorado]] aimed to bring brand awareness to Colorado as a winter destination. The campaign used social media platforms, for example, Facebook and Twitter, to promote this competition, and requested the participants to share experiences, pictures and videos on social media platforms. As a result, Colorado enhanced their image as a winter destination and created a campaign worth about $2.9 million.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe tourism organisation can earn brand royalty from interactive marketing campaigns on social media with engaging passive communication tactics. For example, \u201cMoms\u201d advisors of the [[Walt Disney World]] are responsible for offering suggestions and replying to questions about the family trips at Walt Disney World.

Numerous web-based application services appeared during the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132001 and then vanished, having failed to gain a critical mass of customers.\n\n==Distribution of media==\n\n===XML and RSS===\nMany regard syndication of site content as a Web 2.0 feature. Syndication uses standardized protocols to permit end-users to make use of a site's data in another context (such as another Web site, a [[browser plugin]], or a separate desktop application). Protocols permitting syndication include [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] (really simple syndication, also known as Web syndication), [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (as in RSS 1.1), and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], all of which are [[XML]]-based formats. Observers have started to refer to these technologies as [[Web feed]]s. Specialized protocols such as [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] and [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] (both for social networking) extend the functionality of sites and permit end-users to interact without centralized Web sites.\n\n===Web APIs===\n{{Main|Web API}}\nWeb 2.0 often uses machine-based interactions such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and [[SOAP]]. Servers often expose proprietary [[Application programming interface]]s (API), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) have also come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or [[JSON]] payloads. REST APIs, through their use of self-descriptive messages and [[HATEOAS|hypermedia as the engine of application state]], should be self-describing once an entry [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] is known. [[Web Services Description Language]] (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP Application programming interface and there are [[List of web service specifications|a range of Web service specifications]].\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics of the term claim that \"Web 2.0\" does not represent a new version of the [[World Wide Web]] at all, but merely continues to use so-called \"Web 1.0\" technologies and concepts.<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\" /> First, techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] do not replace underlying protocols like [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], but add a layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 were already featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term \"Web 2.0\" emerged. [[Amazon.com]], for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Amazon Web Services API\n|work=O'Reilly Network\n|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|authorlink=Tim O'Reilly|first=Tim|last=O'Reilly\n|date=2002-06-18\n|accessdate=2006-05-27\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613235806/http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|archivedate=2006-06-13\n}}</ref> Previous developments also came from research in [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer-supported collaborative learning]] and [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW) and from established products like [[Lotus Notes]] and [[Lotus Domino]], all phenomena that preceded Web 2.0. [[Tim Berners-Lee]], who developed the initial technologies of the Web, has been an outspoken critic of the term, while supporting many of the elements associated with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2006/09/7650/|title=Tim Berners-Lee on Web 2.0: \"nobody even knows what it means\"|quote=He's big on blogs and wikis, and has nothing but good things to say about AJAX, but Berners-Lee faults the term \"Web 2.0\" for lacking any coherent meaning.|date=September 2006|access-date=2017-06-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708091023/https://arstechnica.com/business/2006/09/7650/|archive-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live}}</ref> In [[CERN|the environment where the Web originated]], each workstation had a [[dedicated IP address]] and always-on connection to the Internet.

For many people who work in software, version numbers like 2.0 and 3.0 are for [[software versioning]] or hardware versioning only, and to assign 2.0 arbitrarily to many technologies with a variety of real version numbers has no meaning.  The web does not have a version number.  For example, in a 2006 interview with [[IBM]] [[developerWorks]] podcast editor Scott Laningham, Tim Berners-Lee described the term \"Web 2.0\" as a jargon:<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |title=DeveloperWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee |date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821185101/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |archive-date=2012-08-21 |url-status=live }}\n</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Nobody really knows what it means... If Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people to people. But that was what the Web was supposed to be all along... Web 2.0, for some people, it means moving some of the thinking [to the] client side, so making it more immediate, but the idea of the Web as interaction between people is really what the Web is. That was what it was designed to be... a collaborative space where people can interact.\"</blockquote> Other critics labeled Web 2.0 \"a second bubble\" (referring to the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of [[business model]]s.

Keen's 2007 book, ''[[Cult of the Amateur]]'', argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as \"creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels...

For instance, Twitter offers online tools for users to create their own tweet, in a way the users are doing all the work when it comes to producing media content. At the heart of Web 2.0's participatory culture is an inherent disregard for privacy, although it was not much of an issue for giant platforms like Facebook and Google, as users are discovering and exploring the internet because they want users to participate and create more content.

The Web will be understood not as screenfuls of text and graphics but as a transport mechanism, the ether through which interactivity happens. It will [...] appear on your computer screen, [...] on your TV set [...] your car dashboard [...] your cell phone [...] hand-held game machines [...] maybe even your microwave oven.\n}}\nWriting when [[Palm Inc.]] introduced its first web-capable [[personal digital assistant]] (supporting Web access with [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]]), DiNucci saw the Web \"fragmenting\" into a future that extended beyond the browser/PC combination it was identified with. She focused on how the basic information structure and hyper-linking mechanism introduced by [[HTTP]] would be used by a variety of devices and platforms. As such, her \"2.0\" designation refers to the next version of the Web that does not directly relate to the term's current use.\n\nThe term Web 2.0 did not resurface until 2002.<ref>Idehen, Kingsley. 2003.

The year of Web services. CIO, December 15.</ref> Kinsley and Eric focus on the concepts currently associated with the term where, as Scott Dietzen puts it, \"the Web becomes a universal, standards-based integration platform\".<ref name=\"Knorr, Eric 2003\"/> In 2004, the term began to popularize when O'Reilly Media and MediaLive hosted the first Web 2.0 conference. In their opening remarks, [[John Battelle]] and Tim O'Reilly outlined their definition of the \"Web as Platform\", where software applications are built upon the Web as opposed to upon the desktop. The unique aspect of this migration, they argued, is that \"customers are building your business for you\".<ref name=\"O'Reilly, Tim 2004\">O'Reilly, Tim, and John Battelle. 2004. Opening Welcome: State of the Internet Industry. In San Francisco, California, October 5.</ref> They argued that the activities of users generating content (in the form of ideas, text, videos, or pictures) could be \"harnessed\" to create value. O'Reilly and Battelle contrasted Web 2.0 with what they called \"Web 1.0\". They associated this term with the business models of [[Netscape]] and the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]]. For example,\n{{quote|Netscape framed \"the web as platform\" in terms of the old software [[paradigm]]: their flagship product was the web browser, a desktop application, and their strategy was to use their dominance in the browser market to establish a market for high-priced server products. Control over standards for displaying content and applications in the browser would, in theory, give Netscape the kind of market power enjoyed by Microsoft in the PC market. Much like the \"horseless carriage\" framed the automobile as an extension of the familiar, Netscape promoted a \"webtop\" to replace the desktop, and planned to populate that webtop with information updates and applets pushed to the webtop by information providers who would purchase Netscape servers.<ref>O\u2019Reilly, T., 2005.</ref>}} In short, Netscape focused on creating software, releasing updates and bug fixes, and distributing it to the end users. O'Reilly contrasted this with [[Google]], a company that did not, at the time, focus on producing end-user software, but instead on providing a service based on data, such as the links that Web page authors make between sites. Google exploits this user-generated content to offer Web searches based on reputation through its \"[[PageRank]]\" algorithm. Unlike software, which undergoes scheduled releases, such services are constantly updated, a process called \"the [[perpetual beta]]\". A similar difference can be seen between the [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online]] and [[Wikipedia]] \u2013 while the Britannica relies upon experts to write articles and release them periodically in publications, Wikipedia relies on trust in (sometimes anonymous) community members to constantly write and edit content. Wikipedia editors are not required to have educational credentials, such as degrees, in the subjects in which they are editing. Wikipedia is not based on subject-matter expertise, but rather on an adaptation of the [[Open-source software|open source]] software adage [[Linus' Law|\"given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow\"]]. This maxim is stating that if enough users are able to look at a software product's code (or a website), then these users will be able to fix any \"[[Bug (computing)|bugs]]\" or other problems. The Wikipedia volunteer editor community produces, edits, and updates articles constantly. O'Reilly's Web 2.0 conferences have been held every year since 2004, attracting [[entrepreneur]]s, representatives from large companies, tech experts and technology reporters.\n\nThe popularity of Web 2.0 was acknowledged by [[You (Time Person of the Year)|2006 ''TIME magazine'' Person of The Year]] (''You'').<ref>Grossman, Lev. 2006. Person of the Year: You. December 25.

It's about the cosmic compendium of knowledge Wikipedia and the million-channel people's network [[YouTube]] and the online metropolis [[MySpace]].

What is Web 2.0. Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software, p. 30</ref> by way of user participation, can also be viewed as essential attributes of Web 2.0. Some websites require users to contribute user-generated content to have access to the website, to discourage \"free riding\".[[File:Mass Effect Wiki Collaboration.png|thumb|A list of ways that people can volunteer to improve Mass Effect Wiki, an example of content generated by users working collaboratively.]]The key features of Web 2.0 include:{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n# [[Folksonomy]] \u2013 free classification of information; allows users to collectively classify and find information (e.g. [[Tag (metadata)|\"tagging\"]] of websites, images, videos or links)\n# Rich [[user experience]] \u2013 dynamic content that is responsive to user input (e.g., a user can \"click\" on an image to enlarge it or find out more information)\n# [[Crowdsourcing|User participation]] \u2013 information flows two ways between the site owner and site users by means of evaluation, review, and online commenting. Site users also typically create [[user-generated content]] for others to see (e.g., [[Wikipedia]], an online encyclopedia that anyone can write articles for or edit)\n# [[Software as a service]] (SaaS) \u2013 Web 2.0 sites developed [[API]]s to allow automated usage, such as by a [[Web app|Web \"app\"]] ([[software application]]) or a [[mashup (web application hybrid)|mashup]]\n# [[Eternal September|Mass participation]] \u2013 near-universal web access leads to differentiation of concerns, from the traditional Internet user base (who tended to be [[hacker]]s and computer hobbyists) to a wider variety of users\n\n==Technologies==\nThe [[client-side]] ([[Web browser]]) technologies used in Web 2.0 development include [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] and [[JavaScript library|JavaScript frameworks]]. Ajax programming uses [[JavaScript]] and the [[Document Object Model]] (DOM) to update selected regions of the page area without undergoing a full page reload. To allow users to continue interacting with the page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back to the page ([[Asynchronous communication|asynchronously]]). \n\nOtherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases the overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in [[XML]] or [[JSON]] (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used [[structured data]] formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. \n\nWhen this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, [[Google Docs]] uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.\n\nAs a widely available plug-in independent of [[W3C]] standards (the World Wide Web Consortium is the governing body of Web standards and protocols), [[Adobe Flash]] is capable of doing many things that were not possible pre-[[HTML5]]. Of Flash's many capabilities, the most commonly used is its ability to integrate streaming multimedia into HTML pages. With the introduction of HTML5 in 2010 and the growing concerns with Flash's security, the role of Flash is decreasing. \n\nIn addition to Flash and Ajax, JavaScript/Ajax frameworks have recently become a very popular means of creating Web 2.0 sites. At their core, these frameworks use the same technology as JavaScript, Ajax, and the DOM. However, frameworks smooth over inconsistencies between Web browsers and extend the functionality available to developers. Many of them also come with customizable, prefabricated '[[Software widget|widgets]]' that accomplish such common tasks as picking a date from a calendar, displaying a data chart, or making a tabbed panel. \n\nOn the [[Server side|server-side]], Web 2.0 uses many of the same technologies as Web 1.0. Languages such as [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]], as well as [[J2EE|Enterprise Java (J2EE)]] and [[.NET Framework|Microsoft.NET Framework]], are used by developers to output data dynamically using information from files and databases. This allows websites and web services to share [[Machine-readable data|machine readable]] formats such as [[XML]] ([[Atom (standard)|Atom]], [[RSS]], etc.) and [[JSON]]. When data is available in one of these formats, another website can use it to [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|integrate a portion of that site's functionality]].\n\n==Concepts==\n[[File:Qualitydimensions.png|thumb|alt=Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, encyclopedias and Wikipedia|Quality dimensions of web 2.0 portals, [[encyclopedia|encyclopedias]] and [[Wikipedia]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lewoniewski |first1=W\u0142odzimierz |last2=W\u0119cel |first2=Krzysztof |last3=Abramowicz |first3=Witold |date=2019 |title=Multilingual Ranking of Wikipedia Articles with Quality and Popularity Assessment in Different Topics |journal=Computers |volume=8 |issue=3 |pages=60 |doi=10.3390/computers8030060 |doi-access=free }}</ref>]]\nWeb 2.0 can be described in three parts:\n* [[Rich Internet application]] (RIA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines the experience brought from desktop to browser, whether it is \"rich\" from a graphical point of view or a usability/interactivity or features point of view.\n* [[Web-oriented architecture]] (WOA)&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 applications expose their functionality so that other applications can leverage and integrate the functionality providing a set of much richer applications. Examples are [[Web feed|feeds]], [[RSS feed]]s, [[web services]], [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mashups]].\n* [[Social Web]]&nbsp;\u2014 defines how Web 2.0 websites tend to interact much more with the end user and make the end user an integral part of the website, either by adding his or her profile, adding comments on content, uploading new content, or adding [[user-generated content]] (e.g., personal [[digital photo]]s).\n\nAs such, Web 2.0 draws together the capabilities of [[Client (computing)|client]]- and [[Server (computing)|server]]-side software, [[content syndication]] and the use of [[List of network protocols|network protocols]]. Standards-oriented Web browsers may use [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]] and software extensions to handle the content and user interactions. Web 2.0 sites provide users with [[Computer data storage|information storage]], creation, and dissemination capabilities that were not possible in the environment known as \"Web 1.0\".\n\nWeb 2.0 sites include the following features and techniques, referred to as the acronym [[SLATES]] by Andrew McAfee:<ref>McAfee, A.

For example, in the Talis white paper \"Library 2.0: The Challenge of Disruptive Innovation\", [[Paul Miller (journalist)|Paul Miller]] argues\n\n<blockquote>Blogs, wikis and RSS are often held up as exemplary manifestations of Web 2.0. A reader of a blog or a wiki is provided with tools to add a comment or even, in the case of the wiki, to edit the content. This is what we call the Read/Write web. Talis believes that [[Library 2.0]] means harnessing this type of participation so that libraries can benefit from increasingly rich collaborative cataloging efforts, such as including contributions from partner libraries as well as adding rich enhancements, such as book jackets or movie files, to records from publishers and others.<ref>Miller 10\u201311</ref></blockquote>\n\nHere, Miller links Web 2.0 technologies and the culture of participation that they engender to the field of library science, supporting his claim that there is now a \"Library 2.0\". Many of the other proponents of new 2.0s mentioned here use similar methods. The meaning of Web 2.0 is role dependent. For example, some use Web 2.0 to establish and maintain relationships through social networks, while some marketing managers might use this promising technology to \"end-run traditionally unresponsive I.T. department[s].\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |title=i-Technology Viewpoint: It's Time to Take the Quotation Marks Off \"Web 2.0\" &#124; Web 2.0 Journal |publisher=Web2.sys-con.com |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216062850/http://web2.sys-con.com/node/207411 |archive-date=2011-02-16 |url-status=live }}</ref> \n\nThere is a debate over the use of Web 2.0 technologies in mainstream education.

The brand of tourist destinations can be built through marketing campaigns on social media and by engaging with customers. For example, the \u201cSnow at First Sight\u201d campaign launched by the [[Colorado|State of Colorado]] aimed to bring brand awareness to Colorado as a winter destination. The campaign used social media platforms, for example, Facebook and Twitter, to promote this competition, and requested the participants to share experiences, pictures and videos on social media platforms. As a result, Colorado enhanced their image as a winter destination and created a campaign worth about $2.9 million.{{cn|date=January 2020}}\n\nThe tourism organisation can earn brand royalty from interactive marketing campaigns on social media with engaging passive communication tactics.

[[WYSIWYG]] [[wiki]] and [[blog]]ging sites replicate many features of PC authoring applications. Several browser-based services have emerged, including [[EyeOS]]<ref>\n{{cite news\n|url=https://techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/eyeos-open-source-webos-for-the-masses/\n|title=Can eyeOS Succeed Where Desktop.com Failed?\n|work=www.techcrunch.com\n|accessdate=2007-12-12\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212023338/http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/11/27/eyeos-open-source-webos-for-the-masses/\n|archive-date=2007-12-12\n|url-status=live\n}}\n</ref> and [[YouOS]].(No longer active.)<ref>\n{{cite web\n|url=http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/hey_youos.html\n|title=Tech Beat Hey YouOS!&nbsp;\u2013 BusinessWeek\n|publisher=www.businessweek.com\n|accessdate=2007-12-12\n|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071217040221/http://www.businessweek.com/the_thread/techbeat/archives/2006/03/hey_youos.html\n|archive-date=2007-12-17\n|url-status=live\n}}\n</ref> Although named [[operating systems]], many of these services are application platforms. They mimic the user experience of desktop operating systems, offering features and applications similar to a PC environment, and are able to run within any modern browser. However, these so-called \"operating systems\" do not directly control the hardware on the client's computer. Numerous web-based application services appeared during the [[dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132001 and then vanished, having failed to gain a critical mass of customers.\n\n==Distribution of media==\n\n===XML and RSS===\nMany regard syndication of site content as a Web 2.0 feature. Syndication uses standardized protocols to permit end-users to make use of a site's data in another context (such as another Web site, a [[browser plugin]], or a separate desktop application). Protocols permitting syndication include [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] (really simple syndication, also known as Web syndication), [[Resource Description Framework|RDF]] (as in RSS 1.1), and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], all of which are [[XML]]-based formats. Observers have started to refer to these technologies as [[Web feed]]s. Specialized protocols such as [[FOAF (software)|FOAF]] and [[XHTML Friends Network|XFN]] (both for social networking) extend the functionality of sites and permit end-users to interact without centralized Web sites.\n\n===Web APIs===\n{{Main|Web API}}\nWeb 2.0 often uses machine-based interactions such as [[Representational State Transfer|REST]] and [[SOAP]]. Servers often expose proprietary [[Application programming interface]]s (API), but standard APIs (for example, for posting to a blog or notifying a blog update) have also come into use. Most communications through APIs involve XML or [[JSON]] payloads. REST APIs, through their use of self-descriptive messages and [[HATEOAS|hypermedia as the engine of application state]], should be self-describing once an entry [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] is known. [[Web Services Description Language]] (WSDL) is the standard way of publishing a SOAP Application programming interface and there are [[List of web service specifications|a range of Web service specifications]].\n\n==Criticism==\nCritics of the term claim that \"Web 2.0\" does not represent a new version of the [[World Wide Web]] at all, but merely continues to use so-called \"Web 1.0\" technologies and concepts.<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\" /> First, techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] do not replace underlying protocols like [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], but add a layer of abstraction on top of them. Second, many of the ideas of Web 2.0 were already featured in implementations on networked systems well before the term \"Web 2.0\" emerged. [[Amazon.com]], for instance, has allowed users to write reviews and consumer guides since its launch in 1995, in a form of self-publishing. Amazon also opened its API to outside developers in 2002.<ref>{{cite web\n|title=Amazon Web Services API\n|work=O'Reilly Network\n|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|authorlink=Tim O'Reilly|first=Tim|last=O'Reilly\n|date=2002-06-18\n|accessdate=2006-05-27\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060613235806/http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/wlg/1707?wlg=yes\n|archivedate=2006-06-13\n}}</ref> Previous developments also came from research in [[Computer Supported Collaborative Learning|computer-supported collaborative learning]] and [[computer supported cooperative work]] (CSCW) and from established products like [[Lotus Notes]] and [[Lotus Domino]], all phenomena that preceded Web 2.0. [[Tim Berners-Lee]], who developed the initial technologies of the Web, has been an outspoken critic of the term, while supporting many of the elements associated with it.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/business/2006/09/7650/|title=Tim Berners-Lee on Web 2.0: \"nobody even knows what it means\"|quote=He's big on blogs and wikis, and has nothing but good things to say about AJAX, but Berners-Lee faults the term \"Web 2.0\" for lacking any coherent meaning.|date=September 2006|access-date=2017-06-15|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708091023/https://arstechnica.com/business/2006/09/7650/|archive-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live}}</ref> In [[CERN|the environment where the Web originated]], each workstation had a [[dedicated IP address]] and always-on connection to the Internet.

For many people who work in software, version numbers like 2.0 and 3.0 are for [[software versioning]] or hardware versioning only, and to assign 2.0 arbitrarily to many technologies with a variety of real version numbers has no meaning.  The web does not have a version number.  For example, in a 2006 interview with [[IBM]] [[developerWorks]] podcast editor Scott Laningham, Tim Berners-Lee described the term \"Web 2.0\" as a jargon:<ref name=\"developerWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee\">\n{{cite web |url=http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |title=DeveloperWorks Interviews: Tim Berners-Lee |date=2006-07-28 |accessdate=2012-08-05 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120821185101/http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/podcast/dwi/cm-int082206txt.html |archive-date=2012-08-21 |url-status=live }}\n</ref>\n<blockquote>\"Nobody really knows what it means... If Web 2.0 for you is blogs and wikis, then that is people to people. But that was what the Web was supposed to be all along... Web 2.0, for some people, it means moving some of the thinking [to the] client side, so making it more immediate, but the idea of the Web as interaction between people is really what the Web is. That was what it was designed to be... a collaborative space where people can interact.\"</blockquote> Other critics labeled Web 2.0 \"a second bubble\" (referring to the [[Dot-com bubble]] of 1997\u20132000), suggesting that too many Web 2.0 companies attempt to develop the same product with a lack of [[business model]]s. For example, ''[[The Economist]]'' has dubbed the mid- to late-2000s focus on Web companies as \"Bubble 2.0\".<ref>{{cite news |title=Bubble 2.0 |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QQNVDDS |date=2005-12-22 |accessdate=2006-12-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061119042722/http://www.economist.com/business/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_QQNVDDS |archive-date=2006-11-19 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n<!-- ... -->\n<!-- I commented this out as it has been proved invalid, actually wrong, due to subsequent events.

Keen's 2007 book, ''[[Cult of the Amateur]]'', argues that the core assumption of Web 2.0, that all opinions and user-generated content are equally valuable and relevant, is misguided. Additionally, ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reviewer John Flintoff has characterized Web 2.0 as \"creating an endless digital forest of mediocrity: uninformed political commentary, unseemly home videos, embarrassingly amateurish music, unreadable poems, essays and novels...

More importantly, because user participation creates fresh content and profile data that are useful for third parties such as advertising corporates and national security. Therefore, suppression of privacy is built into the business model of Web 2.0 and one should not be too tied up to the optimistic notion of Web 2.0 being the next evolutionary step for digital media.\n\n==Trademark==\nIn November 2004, [[CMP Media]] applied to the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|USPTO]] for a [[service mark]] on the use of the term \"WEB 2.0\" for live events.<ref name=\"uspto\">{{cite web |url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 |title=USPTO serial number 78322306 |publisher=Tarr.uspto.gov |accessdate=2011-02-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113155427/http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78322306 |archive-date=2011-01-13 |url-status=live }}</ref> On the basis of this application, CMP Media sent a [[cease and desist|cease-and-desist]] demand to the Irish non-profit organisation IT@Cork on May 24, 2006,<ref>{{cite web |title=O'Reilly and CMP Exercise Trademark on 'Web 2.0' |work=Slashdot |url=http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/05/26/1238245 |date=2006-05-26 |accessdate=2006-05-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511040244/http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06%2F05%2F26%2F1238245 |archive-date=2009-05-11 |url-status=live }}</ref> but retracted it two days later.<ref>{{cite web | title=O'Reilly's coverage of Web 2.0 as a service mark | work=O'Reilly Radar | url=http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html | first = Nathan | last = Torkington | date=2006-05-26 | accessdate=2006-06-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115224430/http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2006/05/more_on_our_web_20_service_mar.html|archivedate=15 January 2008}}</ref> The \"WEB 2.0\" service mark registration passed final PTO Examining Attorney review on May 10, 2006, and was registered on June 27, 2006.<ref name=\"uspto\"/> The [[European Union]] application (which would confer unambiguous status in Ireland)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212#|title=Application number 004972212|year=2007|access-date=2010-03-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512034116/http://oami.europa.eu/CTMOnline/RequestManager/en_Result?transition=ResultsDetailed&ntmark=&application=CTMOnline&bAdvanced=0&language=en&deno=&source=search_basic.jsp&idappli=004972212|archive-date=2013-05-12|url-status=live}}</ref> was declined on May 23, 2007.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Cloud computing]]\n* [[Collective intelligence]]\n* [[Connectivity (media)|Connectivity]] of social media\n* [[Crowd computing]]\n* [[Enterprise social software]]\n* [[Mass collaboration]]\n* [[New media]]\n* [[Office suite]]\n* [[Open source governance]]\n* [[Privacy issues of social networking sites]]\n* [[Social commerce]]\n* [[Social shopping]]\n* [[Web 2.0 for development]] (web2fordev)\n* [[Semantic Web#Web 3.0|Web 3.0]]\n* [[You (Time Person of the Year)]]\n* [[Libraries in Second Life]]\n* [[List of free software for Web 2.0 Services]]\n* [[Cute cat theory of digital activism]]\n\n; Application domains\n* [[Sci-Mate]]\n* [[Business 2.0]]\n* [[Learning 2.0|E-learning 2.0]]\n* [[e-Government]] (Government 2.0)\n* [[Health 2.0]]\n* [[Science 2.0]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category}}\n* {{Wikiversity-inline}}\n{{Scholia}}\n* {{cite book | title=Web 2.0 / Social Media / Social Networks|year=2017| publisher=MultiMedia| location=Charleston, South Carolina, SUA| isbn=978-1-544-63831-7}}\n\n{{Semantic Web}}\n\n[[Category:Web 2.0| ]]\n[[Category:2000s in computer science]]\n[[Category:Brand management]]\n[[Category:Cloud applications]]\n[[Category:Internet ages]]\n[[Category:Internet culture]]\n[[Category:New media]]\n[[Category:Social information processing]]\n[[Category:Technology neologisms]]\n[[Category:Web 2.0 neologisms| ]]\n[[Category:Web services]]\n[[Category:Words coined in the 2000s]]\n", "name_user": "Rakesh banjare", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eWeb 2.0:Social media are interactive Web 2.0 Internet-based applications.Web 2.0, also called Participative (or Participatory) and Social Web.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0"}

It is the second and final volume of their collaborative work ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]''. While the first volume, ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), sought to \"short-circuit\" a developing \"bureaucracy of analytic reason\" in France (between leftist political parties and psychoanalysis), this book was intended to be a \"positive exercise\" in [[Psychical nomadism|nomadology]] and [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] philosophy<ref name=foreward>{{cite book|author=Brian Massumi|chapter=Translator's Foreword: Pleasures of Philosophy|title=A Thousand Plateaus|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|date=1987|page=xi}}</ref> - philosophy with [[Utilitarianism|utility]] that freely moves between addressed subject matters.\n\nThe book has been considered to be a major statement of [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]], especially starting in the late 20th century. [[Brian Massumi]]'s English translation was published in 1987, a year after the twelfth \"plateau\" was published separately in English as ''Nomadology: The War Machine'' (New York: [[Semiotext(e) | Semiotext[e]]], 1986).\n\n== Summary ==\nLike the first volume, ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), ''A Thousand Plateaus'', as the second volume of ''Capitalism and Schizophrenia'', is politically and terminologically provocative,<ref>{{cite journal|author=Stivale, Charles J.|title=The Literary Element in \"Mille Plateaux\": The New Cartography of Deleuze and Guattari|journal=Substance|volume=13|issue=44\u201345|date=1984|pages=20\u201334|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|jstor=3684772|doi=10.2307/3684772}}</ref> but focuses more so on systematic, environmental and spatial philosophy. A \"plateau\", borrowed from ideas in [[Gregory Bateson]]'s research on Balinese culture, is \"a continuous, self-vibrating region of intensities\".

In between are thirteen chapters or ''plateaux'', each dated non-linearly, sometimes precisely (\"November 20, 1923: Postulates of Linguistics), sometimes less so (\"10,000 BC: The Geology of Morals\"). In the sixth chapter, \"Year Zero: Faciality\" (''visag\u00e9it\u00e9''), the notion of face is discussed as an \"overcoding\" of body,<ref name=\"dg1987\"/>{{rp|170}} but also as being in dialectical tension with landscape (''paysag\u00e9it\u00e9'').<ref name=\"dg1987\">{{cite book |author1=Deleuze, Gilles |author2=Guattari, F\u00e9lix |title=A Thousand Plateaus |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-8166-1402-8}}</ref>{{rp|174}}\n\nIn the same mode as ''Anti-Oedipus'', Deleuze and Guattari evaluate and criticize psychoanalysis: in the first plateau, they discuss the work of [[Sigmund Freud]], especially referring to the case histories of the [[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]] and [[Herbert Graf|Little Hans]].<ref name=dg1993 />{{rp|26-38}}\n\nOwing to their mode of [[literary theory]], ''A Thousand Plateaus'' also frequently discusses literature.

It is the second and final volume of their collaborative work ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]''. While the first volume, ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972), sought to \"short-circuit\" a developing \"bureaucracy of analytic reason\" in France (between leftist political parties and psychoanalysis), this book was intended to be a \"positive exercise\" in [[Psychical nomadism|nomadology]] and [[Rhizome (philosophy)|rhizomatic]] philosophy<ref name=foreward>{{cite book|author=Brian Massumi|chapter=Translator's Foreword: Pleasures of Philosophy|title=A Thousand Plateaus|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|date=1987|page=xi}}</ref> - philosophy with [[Utilitarianism|utility]] that freely moves between addressed subject matters.\n\nThe book has been considered to be a major statement of [[post-structuralism]] and [[postmodernism]], especially starting in the late 20th century.

In between are thirteen chapters or ''plateaux'', each dated non-linearly, sometimes precisely (\"November 20, 1923: Postulates of Linguistics), sometimes less so (\"10,000 BC: The Geology of Morals\"). In the sixth chapter, \"Year Zero: Faciality\" (''visag\u00e9it\u00e9''), the notion of face is discussed as an \"overcoding\" of body,<ref name=\"dg1987\"/>{{rp|170}} but also as being in dialectical tension with landscape (''paysag\u00e9it\u00e9'').<ref name=\"dg1987\">{{cite book |author1=Deleuze, Gilles |author2=Guattari, F\u00e9lix |title=A Thousand Plateaus |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |year=1987 |isbn=978-0-8166-1402-8}}</ref>{{rp|174}}\n\nIn the same mode as ''Anti-Oedipus'', Deleuze and Guattari evaluate and criticize psychoanalysis: in the first plateau, they discuss the work of [[Sigmund Freud]], especially referring to the case histories of the [[Sergei Pankejeff|Wolf Man]] and [[Herbert Graf|Little Hans]].<ref name=dg1993 />{{rp|26-38}}\n\nOwing to their mode of [[literary theory]], ''A Thousand Plateaus'' also frequently discusses literature.

People here learn more about healthy behavior: they are encouraged to think about the pros of changing their behavior and to feel emotions about the effects of their negative behavior on others.\n\nPrecontemplators typically underestimate the pros of changing, overestimate the cons, and often are not aware of making such mistakes.\n\nOne of the most effective steps that others can help with at this stage is to encourage them to become more mindful of their decision making and more conscious of the multiple benefits of changing an unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Stage 2: Contemplation''' (getting ready)\n\nAt this stage, participants are intending to start the healthy behavior within the next 6 months. While they are usually now more aware of the pros of changing, their cons are about equal to their Pros. This ambivalence about changing can cause them to keep putting off taking action.\n\nPeople here learn about the kind of person they could be if they changed their behavior and learn more from people who behave in healthy ways.\n\nOthers can influence and help effectively at this stage by encouraging them to work at reducing the cons of changing their behavior.\n\n'''Stage 3: Preparation''' (ready)\n\nPeople at this stage are ready to start taking action within the next 30 days. They take small steps that they believe can help them make the healthy behavior a part of their lives. For example, they tell their friends and family that they want to change their behavior.\n\nPeople in this stage should be encouraged to seek support from friends they trust, tell people about their plan to change the way they act, and think about how they would feel if they behaved in a healthier way. Their number one concern is: when they act, will they fail? They learn that the better prepared they are, the more likely they are to keep progressing.\n\n'''Stage 4: Action''' (current action)\n\nPeople at this stage have changed their behavior within the last 6 months and need to work hard to keep moving ahead. These participants need to learn how to strengthen their commitments to change and to fight urges to slip back.\n\nPeople in this stage progress by being taught techniques for keeping up their commitments such as substituting activities related to the unhealthy behavior with positive ones, rewarding themselves for taking steps toward changing, and avoiding people and situations that tempt them to behave in unhealthy ways.\n\n'''Stage 5: Maintenance''' (monitoring)\n\nPeople at this stage changed their behavior more than 6 months ago. It is important for people in this stage to be aware of situations that may tempt them to slip back into doing the unhealthy behavior\u2014particularly stressful situations.\n\nIt is recommended that people in this stage seek support from and talk with people whom they trust, spend time with people who behave in healthy ways, and remember to engage in healthy activities (such as exercise and deep relaxation) to cope with stress instead of relying on unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Relapse''' (recycling)<ref name=\"springerlink.com\">DiClemente, CC; Prochaska, JO; Gibertini, M.

Individuals who attempt to quit highly addictive behaviors such as drug, alcohol, and tobacco use are at particularly high risk of a relapse. Achieving a long-term behavior change often requires ongoing support from family members, a health coach, a physician, or another motivational source. Supportive literature and other resources can also be helpful to avoid a relapse from happening.\n\n===Processes of change===\n[[File:Processes of Change 3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Processes of change]]\nThe 10 processes of change are \"covert and overt activities that people use to progress through the stages\".<ref name=ProchaskaAJHP97/>\n\nTo progress through the early stages, people apply cognitive, affective, and evaluative processes. As people move toward Action and Maintenance, they rely more on commitments, counter conditioning, rewards, environmental controls, and support.<ref name=Prochaskaabcd>Prochaska, JO; Redding, CA; Evers, KE.

The pros and cons combine to form a decisional \"balance sheet\" of comparative potential gains and losses. The balance between the pros and cons varies depending on which stage of change the individual is in.\n\nSound decision making requires the consideration of the potential benefits (pros) and costs (cons) associated with a behavior's consequences. TTM research has found the following relationships between the pros, cons, and the stage of change across 48 behaviors and over 100 populations studied.\n* The cons of changing outweigh the pros in the Precontemplation stage.\n* The pros surpass the cons in the middle stages.\n* The pros outweigh the cons in the Action stage.<ref name=HallRossi2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = K.L. | last2 = Rossi | first2 = J.

The progression through the different stages of change is reflected in a gradual change in attitude before the individual acts.

Those randomly assigned to the treatment group received a stage-matched multiple behavior change guide and a series of tailored, individualized interventions for three health behaviors that are crucial to effective weight management: healthy eating (i.e., reducing calorie and dietary fat intake), moderate exercise, and managing emotional distress without eating. Up to three tailored reports (one per behavior) were delivered based on assessments conducted at four time points: baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Multiple Imputation was used to estimate missing data. Generalized Labor Estimating Equations (GLEE) were then used to examine differences between the treatment and comparison groups. At 24 months, those who were in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating at baseline and received treatment were significantly more likely to have reached Action or Maintenance than the comparison group (47.5% vs. 34.3%). The intervention also impacted a related, but untreated behavior: fruit and vegetable consumption. Over 48% of those in the treatment group in a pre-Action stage at baseline progressed to Action or Maintenance for eating at least 5 servings a day of fruit and vegetables as opposed to 39% of the comparison group. Individuals in the treatment group who were in a pre-Action stage for exercise at baseline were also significantly more likely to reach Action or Maintenance (44.9% vs. 38.1%). The treatment also had a significant effect on managing emotional distress without eating, with 49.7% of those in a pre-Action stage at baseline moving to Action or Maintenance versus 30.3% of the comparison group. The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months among those in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating and exercise at baseline. Among those in a pre-Action stage for both healthy eating and exercise at baseline, 30% of those randomized to the treatment group lost 5% or more of their body weight vs. 16.6% in the comparison group. Coaction of behavior change occurred and was much more pronounced in the treatment group with the treatment group losing significantly more than the comparison group. This study demonstrates the ability of TTM-based tailored feedback to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight on a population basis. The treatment produced the highest population impact to date on multiple health risk behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = S. S. | last2 = Paiva | first2 = A.

These may include: friends, books, and interactions with their healthcare providers. These factors could potentially influence how successful a patient may be in moving through the different stages. This stresses the importance to have continuous monitoring and efforts to maintain progress at each stage. TTM helps guide the treatment process at each stage, and may assist the healthcare provider in making an optimal therapeutic decision.\n\n=== Travel research ===\nThe use of TTM in travel behaviour interventions is rather novel. A number of cross-sectional studies investigated the individual constructs of TTM, e.g. stage of change, decisional balance and self-efficacy, with regards to transport mode choice. The cross-sectional studies identified both motivators and barriers at the different stages regarding biking, walking and public transport.<ref name=\":02\">{{cite journal | last1 = Mutrie | first1 = N. | last2 = Carney | first2 = C. | last3 = Blamey | first3 = A. | last4 = Crawford | first4 = F. | last5 = Aitchison | first5 = T. | last6 = Whitelaw | first6 = A. | year = 2002 | title = \"Walk in to work out\":A randomised controlled trial of a self help intervention to promote active commuting | url = | journal = J.

A reduction in the number of cars on our roads solves other problems such as congestion, traffic noise and traffic accidents. By combining health and environment related purposes, the message becomes stronger.

Health-centred intervention studies measured BMI, weight, waist circumference as well as general health. However, only one of three found a significant change in general health, while BMI and other measures had no effect.<ref name=\":02\" /> Measures that are associated with both health and sustainability were more common. Effects were reported as number of car trips, distance travelled, main mode share etc. Results varied due to greatly differing approaches. In general, car use could be reduced between 6% and 55%, while use of the alternative mode (walking, biking and/or public transport) increased between 11% and 150%.<ref name=\":12\"/> These results indicate a shift to action or maintenance stage, some researchers investigated attitude shifts such as the willingness to change. Attitudes towards using alternative modes improved with approximately 20% to 70%.<ref name=\":12\"/> Many of the intervention studies did not clearly differentiate between the five stages, but categorised participants in pre-action and action stage. This approach makes it difficult to assess the effects per stage. Also, interventions included different processes of change; in many cases these processes are not matched to the recommended stage.<ref name=\":12\"/> It highlights the need to develop a standardised approach for travel intervention design. Identifying and assessing which processes are most effective in the context of travel behaviour change should be a priority in the future in order to secure the role of TTM in travel behaviour research.\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe TTM has been called \"arguably the dominant model of health behaviour change, having received unprecedented research attention, yet it has simultaneously attracted criticism\".<ref name=\"Armitage\"/> Depending on the field of application (e.g. smoking cessation, substance abuse, condom use, diabetes treatment, obesity and travel) somewhat different criticisms have been raised.\n\nIn a [[systematic review]], published in 2003, of 23 [[randomized controlled trial]]s, the authors found that \"stage based interventions are no more effective than non-stage based interventions or no intervention in changing [[smoking]] behaviour.<ref>Riemsma, RP; Pattenden, J; Bridle, C; Sowden, AJ; Mather, L; Watt, IS; Walker, A.

Accessed 2009 Mar 18.</ref> However, it was also mentioned that stage based interventions are often used and implemented inadequately in practice. Thus, criticism is directed towards the use rather the effectiveness of the model itself. Looking at interventions targeting smoking cessation in pregnancy found that stage-matched interventions were more effective than non-matched interventions. One reason for this was the greater intensity of stage-matched interventions.<ref>Aveyard, P; Lawrence, T; Cheng, KK; Griffin, C; Croghan, E; Johnson, C.

The study claims that those not wanting to change (i.e. precontemplators) tend to be responsive to neither stage nor non-stage based interventions. Since stage-based interventions tend to be more intensive they appear to be most effective at targeting contemplators and above rather than pre-contemplators.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aveyard | first1 = P | last2 = Massey | first2 = L | last3 = Parsons | first3 = A | last4 = Manaseki | first4 = S | last5 = Griffin | first5 = C | date = Feb 2009 | title = The effect of transtheoretical model based interventions on smoking cessation | url = | journal = Soc Sci Med | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 397\u2013403 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.10.036 | pmid = 19038483 }}</ref> A 2010 systematic review of [[smoking cessation]] studies under the auspices of the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found that \"stage-based self-help interventions (expert systems and/or tailored materials) and individual counselling were neither more nor less effective than their non-stage-based equivalents.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cahill | first1 = K | last2 = Lancaster | first2 = T | last3 = Green | first3 = N | year = 2010 | title = Stage-based interventions for smoking cessation | url = | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev. | volume = 11 | issue = 11| page = CD004492 | pmid = 21069681 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004492.pub4 }}</ref>\n\nMain criticism is raised regarding the \"arbitrary dividing lines\" that are drawn between the stages. West claimed that a more coherent and distinguishable definition for the stages is needed.<ref name=\"West 2005\"/> Especially the fact that the stages are bound to a specific time interval is perceived to be misleading.

Earlier in a 2009 paper, the TTM was considered to be useful in promoting physical activity. In this study, the algorithms and questionnaires that researchers used to assign people to stages of change lacked standardisation to be compared empirically, or validated.<ref>{{cite journal | pmc = 2879180 | pmid=19298418 | doi=10.1111/j.1468-0009.2009.00550.x | volume=87 | title=Physical activity and food environments: solutions to the obesity epidemic | year=2009 | journal=Milbank Q | pages=123\u201354  | last1 = Sallis | first1 = JF | last2 = Glanz | first2 = K}}</ref><ref name=\"West 2005\"/>\n\nSimilar criticism regarding the standardisation as well as consistency in the use of TTM is also raised in a recent review on travel interventions.<ref name=\":12\"/> With regard to travel interventions only stages of change and sometimes decisional balance constructs are included.

For example, many studies supporting the model have been [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]], but [[longitudinal study]] data would allow for stronger causal inferences. Another point of criticism is raised in a 2002 review, where the model's stages were characterized as \"not mutually exclusive\".<ref name=\":32\">Littell, JH; Girvin, H.

People here learn more about healthy behavior: they are encouraged to think about the pros of changing their behavior and to feel emotions about the effects of their negative behavior on others.\n\nPrecontemplators typically underestimate the pros of changing, overestimate the cons, and often are not aware of making such mistakes.\n\nOne of the most effective steps that others can help with at this stage is to encourage them to become more mindful of their decision making and more conscious of the multiple benefits of changing an unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Stage 2: Contemplation''' (getting ready)\n\nAt this stage, participants are intending to start the healthy behavior within the next 6 months. While they are usually now more aware of the pros of changing, their cons are about equal to their Pros. This ambivalence about changing can cause them to keep putting off taking action.\n\nPeople here learn about the kind of person they could be if they changed their behavior and learn more from people who behave in healthy ways.\n\nOthers can influence and help effectively at this stage by encouraging them to work at reducing the cons of changing their behavior.\n\n'''Stage 3: Preparation''' (ready)\n\nPeople at this stage are ready to start taking action within the next 30 days. They take small steps that they believe can help them make the healthy behavior a part of their lives. For example, they tell their friends and family that they want to change their behavior.\n\nPeople in this stage should be encouraged to seek support from friends they trust, tell people about their plan to change the way they act, and think about how they would feel if they behaved in a healthier way. Their number one concern is: when they act, will they fail? They learn that the better prepared they are, the more likely they are to keep progressing.\n\n'''Stage 4: Action''' (current action)\n\nPeople at this stage have changed their behavior within the last 6 months and need to work hard to keep moving ahead. These participants need to learn how to strengthen their commitments to change and to fight urges to slip back.\n\nPeople in this stage progress by being taught techniques for keeping up their commitments such as substituting activities related to the unhealthy behavior with positive ones, rewarding themselves for taking steps toward changing, and avoiding people and situations that tempt them to behave in unhealthy ways.\n\n'''Stage 5: Maintenance''' (monitoring)\n\nPeople at this stage changed their behavior more than 6 months ago. It is important for people in this stage to be aware of situations that may tempt them to slip back into doing the unhealthy behavior\u2014particularly stressful situations.\n\nIt is recommended that people in this stage seek support from and talk with people whom they trust, spend time with people who behave in healthy ways, and remember to engage in healthy activities (such as exercise and deep relaxation) to cope with stress instead of relying on unhealthy behavior.\n\n'''Relapse''' (recycling)<ref name=\"springerlink.com\">DiClemente, CC; Prochaska, JO; Gibertini, M.

Individuals who attempt to quit highly addictive behaviors such as drug, alcohol, and tobacco use are at particularly high risk of a relapse. Achieving a long-term behavior change often requires ongoing support from family members, a health coach, a physician, or another motivational source. Supportive literature and other resources can also be helpful to avoid a relapse from happening.\n\n===Processes of change===\n[[File:Processes of Change 3.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Processes of change]]\nThe 10 processes of change are \"covert and overt activities that people use to progress through the stages\".<ref name=ProchaskaAJHP97/>\n\nTo progress through the early stages, people apply cognitive, affective, and evaluative processes.

The pros and cons combine to form a decisional \"balance sheet\" of comparative potential gains and losses. The balance between the pros and cons varies depending on which stage of change the individual is in.\n\nSound decision making requires the consideration of the potential benefits (pros) and costs (cons) associated with a behavior's consequences. TTM research has found the following relationships between the pros, cons, and the stage of change across 48 behaviors and over 100 populations studied.\n* The cons of changing outweigh the pros in the Precontemplation stage.\n* The pros surpass the cons in the middle stages.\n* The pros outweigh the cons in the Action stage.<ref name=HallRossi2008>{{cite journal | last1 = Hall | first1 = K.L. | last2 = Rossi | first2 = J.

Those randomly assigned to the treatment group received a stage-matched multiple behavior change guide and a series of tailored, individualized interventions for three health behaviors that are crucial to effective weight management: healthy eating (i.e., reducing calorie and dietary fat intake), moderate exercise, and managing emotional distress without eating. Up to three tailored reports (one per behavior) were delivered based on assessments conducted at four time points: baseline, 3, 6, and 9 months. All participants were followed up at 6, 12, and 24 months. Multiple Imputation was used to estimate missing data. Generalized Labor Estimating Equations (GLEE) were then used to examine differences between the treatment and comparison groups. At 24 months, those who were in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating at baseline and received treatment were significantly more likely to have reached Action or Maintenance than the comparison group (47.5% vs. 34.3%). The intervention also impacted a related, but untreated behavior: fruit and vegetable consumption. Over 48% of those in the treatment group in a pre-Action stage at baseline progressed to Action or Maintenance for eating at least 5 servings a day of fruit and vegetables as opposed to 39% of the comparison group. Individuals in the treatment group who were in a pre-Action stage for exercise at baseline were also significantly more likely to reach Action or Maintenance (44.9% vs. 38.1%). The treatment also had a significant effect on managing emotional distress without eating, with 49.7% of those in a pre-Action stage at baseline moving to Action or Maintenance versus 30.3% of the comparison group. The groups differed on weight lost at 24 months among those in a pre-Action stage for healthy eating and exercise at baseline. Among those in a pre-Action stage for both healthy eating and exercise at baseline, 30% of those randomized to the treatment group lost 5% or more of their body weight vs. 16.6% in the comparison group. Coaction of behavior change occurred and was much more pronounced in the treatment group with the treatment group losing significantly more than the comparison group. This study demonstrates the ability of TTM-based tailored feedback to improve healthy eating, exercise, managing emotional distress, and weight on a population basis. The treatment produced the highest population impact to date on multiple health risk behaviors.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = S. S. | last2 = Paiva | first2 = A.

These may include: friends, books, and interactions with their healthcare providers. These factors could potentially influence how successful a patient may be in moving through the different stages. This stresses the importance to have continuous monitoring and efforts to maintain progress at each stage. TTM helps guide the treatment process at each stage, and may assist the healthcare provider in making an optimal therapeutic decision.\n\n=== Travel research ===\nThe use of TTM in travel behaviour interventions is rather novel.

Perceived barriers were e.g. personal fitness, time and the weather. This knowledge was used to design interventions that would address attitudes and misconceptions to encourage an increased use of bikes and walking. These interventions aim at changing people's travel behaviour towards more sustainable and more active transport modes. In health-related studies, TTM is used to help people walk or bike more instead of using the car.<ref name=\":02\" /><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Diniz | first1 = I. | last2 = Duarte | first2 = M. | last3 = Peres | first3 = K. | last4 = de Oliveira | first4 = E. | last5 = Berndt | first5 = A. | year = 2015 | title = Active commuting by bicycle: Results of an educational intervention study | url = | journal = J.

A reduction in the number of cars on our roads solves other problems such as congestion, traffic noise and traffic accidents. By combining health and environment related purposes, the message becomes stronger.

Health-centred intervention studies measured BMI, weight, waist circumference as well as general health. However, only one of three found a significant change in general health, while BMI and other measures had no effect.<ref name=\":02\" /> Measures that are associated with both health and sustainability were more common. Effects were reported as number of car trips, distance travelled, main mode share etc. Results varied due to greatly differing approaches. In general, car use could be reduced between 6% and 55%, while use of the alternative mode (walking, biking and/or public transport) increased between 11% and 150%.<ref name=\":12\"/> These results indicate a shift to action or maintenance stage, some researchers investigated attitude shifts such as the willingness to change. Attitudes towards using alternative modes improved with approximately 20% to 70%.<ref name=\":12\"/> Many of the intervention studies did not clearly differentiate between the five stages, but categorised participants in pre-action and action stage. This approach makes it difficult to assess the effects per stage. Also, interventions included different processes of change; in many cases these processes are not matched to the recommended stage.<ref name=\":12\"/> It highlights the need to develop a standardised approach for travel intervention design. Identifying and assessing which processes are most effective in the context of travel behaviour change should be a priority in the future in order to secure the role of TTM in travel behaviour research.\n\n==Criticisms==\nThe TTM has been called \"arguably the dominant model of health behaviour change, having received unprecedented research attention, yet it has simultaneously attracted criticism\".<ref name=\"Armitage\"/> Depending on the field of application (e.g. smoking cessation, substance abuse, condom use, diabetes treatment, obesity and travel) somewhat different criticisms have been raised.\n\nIn a [[systematic review]], published in 2003, of 23 [[randomized controlled trial]]s, the authors found that \"stage based interventions are no more effective than non-stage based interventions or no intervention in changing [[smoking]] behaviour.<ref>Riemsma, RP; Pattenden, J; Bridle, C; Sowden, AJ; Mather, L; Watt, IS; Walker, A.

Accessed 2009 Mar 18.</ref> However, it was also mentioned that stage based interventions are often used and implemented inadequately in practice. Thus, criticism is directed towards the use rather the effectiveness of the model itself. Looking at interventions targeting smoking cessation in pregnancy found that stage-matched interventions were more effective than non-matched interventions. One reason for this was the greater intensity of stage-matched interventions.<ref>Aveyard, P; Lawrence, T; Cheng, KK; Griffin, C; Croghan, E; Johnson, C.

Treatment for Cigarette Smoking Among Depressed Mental Health Outpatients: A Randomized Clinical Trial ''American Journal of Public Health'' 1808; 96-1814.</ref> Further studies, e.g. a randomized controlled trial published in 2009, found no evidence that a TTM based smoking cessation intervention was more effective than a control intervention not tailored to stage of change. The study claims that those not wanting to change (i.e. precontemplators) tend to be responsive to neither stage nor non-stage based interventions. Since stage-based interventions tend to be more intensive they appear to be most effective at targeting contemplators and above rather than pre-contemplators.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aveyard | first1 = P | last2 = Massey | first2 = L | last3 = Parsons | first3 = A | last4 = Manaseki | first4 = S | last5 = Griffin | first5 = C | date = Feb 2009 | title = The effect of transtheoretical model based interventions on smoking cessation | url = | journal = Soc Sci Med | volume = 68 | issue = 3| pages = 397\u2013403 | doi = 10.1016/j.socscimed.2008.10.036 | pmid = 19038483 }}</ref> A 2010 systematic review of [[smoking cessation]] studies under the auspices of the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] found that \"stage-based self-help interventions (expert systems and/or tailored materials) and individual counselling were neither more nor less effective than their non-stage-based equivalents.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Cahill | first1 = K | last2 = Lancaster | first2 = T | last3 = Green | first3 = N | year = 2010 | title = Stage-based interventions for smoking cessation | url = | journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev. | volume = 11 | issue = 11| page = CD004492 | pmid = 21069681 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD004492.pub4 }}</ref>\n\nMain criticism is raised regarding the \"arbitrary dividing lines\" that are drawn between the stages. West claimed that a more coherent and distinguishable definition for the stages is needed.<ref name=\"West 2005\"/> Especially the fact that the stages are bound to a specific time interval is perceived to be misleading. Additionally, the effectiveness of stage-based interventions differs depending on the behavior.

There were only five studies in the Review, two of which were later dropped due to not being relevant since they did not measure weight.  Earlier in a 2009 paper, the TTM was considered to be useful in promoting physical activity. In this study, the algorithms and questionnaires that researchers used to assign people to stages of change lacked standardisation to be compared empirically, or validated.<ref>Sallis, J.

The processes used to build the intervention are rarely stage-matched and short cuts are taken by classifying participants in a pre-action stage, which summarises the precontemplation, contemplation and preparation stage, and an action/maintenance stage.<ref name=\":12\" /> More generally, TTM has been criticised within various domains due to the limitations in the research designs. For example, many studies supporting the model have been [[Cross-sectional study|cross-sectional]], but [[longitudinal study]] data would allow for stronger causal inferences. Another point of criticism is raised in a 2002 review, where the model's stages were characterized as \"not mutually exclusive\".<ref name=\":32\">Littell, JH; Girvin, H.

Latent transition analysis to the stages of change for smoking cessation.
