The Midshipmen were led by eighth-year head coach [[Ken Niumatalolo]] and played their home games at [[Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium]]. The Midshipmen competed as a member of the Western Division of the [[American Athletic Conference]], and were first year members of the conference. In their entire football history, this was the first season that Navy did not compete as an Independent. They finished the season 11\u20132, 7\u20131 in American Athletic play to finish in a tie for the Western Division title with [[2015 Houston Cougars football team|Houston]]. However, due to their head to head loss to Houston, they did not represent the Western Division in the [[2015 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game|American Championship]]. They were invited to the [[2015 Military Bowl|Military Bowl]] where they defeated [[2015 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Before the season==\n===Previous season===\nThe Navy Midshipmen began the 2014 season with a loss over #6 ranked [[Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], but won two in a row defeating [[Temple Owls football|Temple]] and [[Texas State Bobcats football|Texas State]]. However, they suffered three consecutive losses to [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] and [[WKU Hilltoppers football|WKU]], along with rival [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]]. They rebounded by beating [[VMI Keydets football|VMI]] and [[San Jose State Spartans football|San Jose State]], before falling to #10 ranked rival [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]]. Navy ended their season with three victories over [[Georgia Southern Eagles football|Georgia Southern]], [[South Alabama Jaguars football|South Alabama]], and military rival [[Army Black Knights football|Army]] in the 115th [[Army\u2013Navy Game]], their 13th consecutive victory over Army. The Midshipmen finished the regular season with a 7\u20135 record. This earned the Midshipmen an invitation to the [[2014 Poinsettia Bowl]], their 11th bowl game in a row, in which they beat the 7\u20135 [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State Aztecs]] 17\u201316.\n\n===Spring practices===\nNavy held spring practices during March and April 2015.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Schedule==\n{{CFB schedule\n| rankyear = 2015\n| poll = AP\n| timezone = Eastern\n\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = September 5\n| time = 12:00 p.m.\n| w/l = w\n| nonconf = y\n| rank = \n| opponent = [[2015 Colgate Raiders football team|Colgate]]\n| site_stadium = [[Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium]]\n| site_cityst = [[Annapolis, Maryland|Annapolis, MD]]\n| tv = [[CBS Sports Network|CBSSN]]\n| score = 48\u201310\n| attend = 28,015\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = September 19\n| time = 3:30 p.m.\n| w/l = w\n| rank = \n| opponent = [[2015 East Carolina Pirates football team|East Carolina]]\n| site_stadium = Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium\n| site_cityst = Annapolis, MD\n| tv = CBSSN\n| score = 45\u201321\n| attend = 34,717\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = September 26\n| time = 12:00 p.m.\n| w/l = w\n| away = y\n| rank = \n| opponent = [[2015 UConn Huskies football team|UConn]]\n| site_stadium = [[Rentschler Field (stadium)|Rentschler Field]]\n| site_cityst = [[East Hartford, Connecticut|East Hartford, CT]]\n| tv = CBSSN\n| score = 28\u201318\n| attend = 33,204\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 3\n| time = 3:30 p.m.\n| w/l = w\n| nonconf = y\n| rank = \n| opponent = [[2015 Air Force Falcons football team|Air Force]]\n| gamename = [[Commander-in-Chief's Trophy]]\n| site_stadium = Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium\n| site_cityst = Annapolis, MD\n| tv = CBSSN\n| score = 33\u201311\n| attend = 32,705\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 10\n| time = 3:30 p.m.\n| w/l = l\n| nonconf = y\n| away = y\n| rank = \n| opponent = [[2015 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]]\n| opprank = 15\n| gamename = [[Navy\u2013Notre Dame football rivalry|Rip Miller Trophy]]\n| site_stadium = [[Notre Dame Stadium]]\n| site_cityst = [[Notre Dame, Indiana|Notre Dame, IN]]\n| tv = [[Notre Dame Football on NBC|NBC]]\n| score = 24\u201341\n| attend = 80,795\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 24\n| time = 1:00 p.m.\n| w/l = w\n| rank = \n| opponent = [[2015 Tulane Green Wave football team|Tulane]]\n| site_stadium = Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium\n| site_cityst = Annapolis, MD\n| tv = CBSSN\n| score = 31\u201314\n| attend = 32,033\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = October 31\n| time = 12:00 p.m.\n| w/l = w\n| rank = \n| opponent = [[2015 South Florida Bulls football team|South Florida]]\n| site_stadium = Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium\n| site_cityst = Annapolis, MD\n| tv = CBSSN\n| score = 29\u201317\n| attend = 26,766\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 7\n| time = 7:00 p.m.\n| w/l = w\n| away = y\n| rank = \n| opponent = [[2015 Memphis Tigers football team|Memphis]]\n| opprank = 15\n| site_stadium = [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium]]\n| site_cityst = [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis, TN]]\n| tv = [[ESPN2 College Football Saturday Primetime|ESPN2]]\n| score = 45\u201320\n| attend = 55,212\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 14\n| time = 3:30 p.m.\n| w/l = w\n| rank = 22\n| opponent = [[2015 SMU Mustangs football team|SMU]]\n| gamename = [[Gansz Trophy]]\n| site_stadium = Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium\n| site_cityst = Annapolis, MD\n| tv = CBSSN\n| score = 55\u201314\n| attend = 35,778\n}}\n|{{CFB schedule entry\n| date = November 21\n| time = 7:00 p.m.\n| w/l = w\n| away = y\n| rank = 19\n| opponent = [[2015 Tulsa Golden Hurricane football team|Tulsa]]\n| site_stadium = [[Skelly Field at H.

The Midshipmen were led by eighth-year head coach [[Ken Niumatalolo]] and played their home games at [[Navy\u2013Marine Corps Memorial Stadium]]. The Midshipmen competed as a member of the Western Division of the [[American Athletic Conference]], and were first year members of the conference. In their entire football history, this was the first season that Navy did not compete as an Independent. They finished the season 11\u20132, 7\u20131 in American Athletic play to finish in a tie for the Western Division title with [[2015 Houston Cougars football team|Houston]]. However, due to their head to head loss to Houston, they did not represent the Western Division in the [[2015 American Athletic Conference Football Championship Game|American Championship]]. They were invited to the [[2015 Military Bowl|Military Bowl]] where they defeated [[2015 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh]].\n\n==Before the season==\n===Previous season===\nThe Navy Midshipmen began the 2014 season with a loss over #6 ranked [[Ohio State Buckeyes football team|Ohio State]], but won two in a row defeating [[Temple Owls football|Temple]] and [[Texas State Bobcats football|Texas State]]. However, they suffered three consecutive losses to [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]] and [[WKU Hilltoppers football|WKU]], along with rival [[Air Force Falcons football|Air Force]]. They rebounded by beating [[VMI Keydets football|VMI]] and [[San Jose State Spartans football|San Jose State]], before falling to #10 ranked rival [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]]. Navy ended their season with three victories over [[Georgia Southern Eagles football|Georgia Southern]], [[South Alabama Jaguars football|South Alabama]], and military rival [[Army Black Knights football|Army]] in the 115th [[Army\u2013Navy Game]], their 13th consecutive victory over Army. The Midshipmen finished the regular season with a 7\u20135 record.

From July 1945 through June 1946, the United States shipped 16.5 million tons of food, primarily wheat, to Europe and Japan.

Although most small towns and villages had not suffered as much damage, the destruction of transportation left them economically isolated.

To clarify the American position, a major address by Secretary of State [[George Marshall]] was planned. Marshall gave the address at Harvard University on June 5, 1947. He offered American aid to promote European recovery and reconstruction. The speech described the dysfunction of the European economy and presented a rationale for US aid.\n\n<blockquote>The modern system of the division of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down.&nbsp;... Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Any government that is willing to assist in recovery will find full co-operation on the part of the United States. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jussi M.

He offered aid, but the European countries had to organize the program themselves.\n\nThe speech, written by [[Charles Bohlen]], contained virtually no details and no numbers. More a proposal than a plan, it was a challenge to European leaders to cooperate and coordinate.  It asked Europeans to create their own plan for rebuilding Europe, indicating the United States would then fund this plan. The administration felt that the plan would likely be unpopular among many Americans, and the speech was mainly directed at a European audience. In an attempt to keep the speech out of American papers, journalists were not contacted, and on the same day, Truman called a press conference to take away headlines. In contrast, Dean Acheson, an Under Secretary of State, was dispatched to contact the European media, especially the British media, and the speech was read in its entirety on the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles L.

The two agreed that it would be necessary to invite the Soviets as the other major allied power. Marshall's speech had explicitly included an invitation to the Soviets, feeling that excluding them would have been a sign of distrust. State Department officials, however, knew that [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] would almost certainly not participate and that any plan that would send large amounts of aid to the Soviets was unlikely to get Congressional approval.\n\n===Initial reactions===\nSpeaking at the Paris Peace Conference on October 10, 1946 Molotov had already stated Soviet fears: \"If American capital was given a free hand in the small states ruined  and enfeebled by the war [it] would buy up the local industries, appropriate the more attractive Rumanian, Yugoslav ... enterprises and would become the master in these small states.<ref>McCauley, Martin, ''Origins of the Cold War 1941-1949'', Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317362470}}, 244 p., p. 147</ref>\" While the Soviet ambassador in Washington suspected that the Marshall Plan could lead to the creation of an anti-Soviet bloc, Stalin was open to the offer.<ref name=\"wettig138\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=138}}</ref> He directed that\u2014in negotiations to be held in Paris regarding the aid\u2014countries in the Eastern Bloc should not reject economic conditions being placed upon them.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> Stalin only changed his outlook when he learned that (a) credit would only be extended under conditions of economic cooperation and, (b) aid would also be extended to Germany in total, an eventuality which Stalin thought would hamper the Soviets' ability to exercise influence in western Germany.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/>\n\nInitially, Stalin  maneuvered to kill the Plan, or at least hamper it by means of destructive participation in the Paris talks regarding conditions.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> He quickly realized, however, that this would be impossible after Molotov reported\u2014following his arrival in Paris in July 1947\u2014that conditions for the credit were non-negotiable.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> Looming as just as large a concern was the Czechoslovak eagerness to accept the aid, as well as indications of a similar Polish attitude.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/>\n\nStalin suspected a possibility that these Eastern Bloc countries might defy Soviet directives not to accept the aid, potentially causing a loss of control of the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> In addition, the most important condition was that every country choosing to take advantage of the plan would need to have its economic situation independently assessed\u2014a level of scrutiny to which the Soviets could not agree.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Bevin and Bidault also insisted that any aid be accompanied by the creation of a unified European economy, something incompatible with the strict Soviet command economy.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Compulsory Eastern Bloc rejection===\nSoviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] left Paris, rejecting the plan.<ref name=\"wettig139\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=139}}</ref> Thereafter, statements were made suggesting a future confrontation with the West, calling the United States both a \"fascizing\" power and the \"center of worldwide reaction and anti-Soviet activity\", with all U.S.-aligned countries branded as enemies.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> The Soviets also then blamed the United States for communist losses in elections in Belgium, France and Italy months earlier, in the spring of 1947.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> It claimed that \"marshallization\" must be resisted and prevented by any means, and that French and Italian communist parties were to take maximum efforts to sabotage the implementation of the Plan.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> In addition, Western embassies in Moscow were isolated, with their personnel being denied contact with Soviet officials.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/>\n\nOn July 12, a larger meeting was convened in Paris. Every country of Europe was invited, with the exceptions of Spain (a World War II neutral that had sympathized with [[Axis powers]]) and the small states of [[Andorra]], [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. The Soviet Union was invited with the understanding that it would likely refuse. The states of the future [[Eastern Bloc]] were also approached, and [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]] agreed to attend. In one of the clearest signs and reflections of tight Soviet control and domination over the region, [[Jan Masaryk]], the foreign minister of Czechoslovakia, was summoned to Moscow and berated by Stalin for considering Czechoslovakia's possible involvement with and joining of the Marshall Plan. The prime minister of Poland, [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]], was rewarded by Stalin for his country's rejection of the Plan, which came in the form of the Soviet Union's offer of a lucrative [[trade agreement]] lasting for a period of five years, a grant amounting to the approximate equivalent of $450 million (in 1948; the sum would have been $4.4 billion in 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/|title=US Inflation Calculator|website=US Inflation Calculator}}</ref>) in the form of long-term credit and loans and the provision of 200,000 tonnes of grain, heavy and manufacturing machinery and factories and heavy industries to Poland.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855998,00.html |title=Carnations&nbsp;\u2014 TIME |magazine=TIME |date=February 9, 1948 |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Marshall Plan participants were not surprised when the Czechoslovakian and Polish delegations were prevented from attending the Paris meeting.

The Soviet Union's \"alternative\" to the Marshall plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with western Europe, became known as the [[Molotov Plan]], and later, the [[Comecon]]. In a 1947 speech to the United Nations, Soviet deputy foreign minister [[Andrei Vyshinsky]] said that the Marshall Plan violated the principles of the United Nations. He accused the United States of attempting to impose its will on other independent states, while at the same time using economic resources distributed as relief to needy nations as an instrument of political pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/hist249/course/Documents/vyshinsky_speech_to_un.htm|title=Vyshinsky Speech to U.N.

However, in 1948 [[Tito-Stalin Split|Tito broke decisively with Stalin]] on other issues, making Yugoslavia an independent communist state. Yugoslavia requested American aid. American leaders were internally divided, but finally agreed and began sending money on a small scale in 1949, and on a much larger scale in 1950\u201353.

Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] (R-Ohio) hedged on the issue. He said it was without economic justification; however, it was \"absolutely necessary\" in \"the world battle against communism.\" In the end, only 17 senators voted against it on March 13, 1948<ref>John C.

Truman's own prestige and power had been greatly enhanced by his stunning victory in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]]. Across America, multiple interest groups, including business, labor, farming, philanthropy, ethnic groups, and religious groups, saw the Marshall Plan as an inexpensive solution to a massive problem, noting it would also help American exports and stimulate the American economy as well. Major newspapers were highly supportive, including such conservative outlets as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]. Vandenberg made sure of bipartisan support on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Solid Democratic South was highly supportive, the upper Midwest was dubious, but heavily outnumbered.

Sixteen nations met in Paris to determine what form the American aid would take, and how it would be divided. The negotiations were long and complex, with each nation having its own interests. France's major concern was that Germany not be rebuilt to its previous threatening power. The [[Benelux]] countries (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg), despite also suffering under the Nazis, had long been closely linked to the German economy and felt their prosperity depended on its revival. The Scandinavian nations, especially [[Sweden]], insisted that their long-standing trading relationships with the Eastern Bloc nations not be disrupted and that their neutrality not be infringed.<ref name=\"Cini, p.24 in Schain\">Cini, p.24 in Schain</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom insisted on special status as a longstanding belligerent during the war, concerned that if it were treated equally with the devastated continental powers it would receive virtually no aid. The Americans were pushing the importance of free trade and European unity to form a bulwark against communism. The Truman administration, represented by [[William L. Clayton]], promised the Europeans that they would be free to structure the plan themselves, but the administration also reminded the Europeans that implementation depended on the plan's passage through Congress. A majority of Congress members were committed to free trade and European integration, and were hesitant to spend too much of the money on Germany.<ref name=\"Cini, p.24 in Schain\"/> However, before the Marshall Plan was in effect, France, Austria, and Italy needed immediate aid. On December 17, 1947, the United States agreed to give $40 million to France, Austria, China, and Italy.<ref>Sorel, Eliot, and Pier Carlo Padoan. The Marshall Plan: Lessons Learned for the 21st Century. Paris: OECD, 2008. 15-16. Print.</ref>\n\nAgreement was eventually reached and the Europeans sent a reconstruction plan to Washington, which was formulated and agreed upon by the [[Committee of European Economic Co-operation]] in 1947. In the document, the Europeans asked for $22 billion in aid. Truman cut this to $17 billion in the bill he put to Congress.\nOn March 17, 1948, Truman addressed European security and condemned the Soviet Union before a hastily convened [[Joint Session of Congress]]. Attempting to contain spreading Soviet influence in the Eastern Bloc, Truman asked Congress to restore a peacetime military draft and to swiftly pass the '''Economic Cooperation Act,''' the name given to the Marshall Plan. Of the Soviet Union Truman said, \"The situation in the world today is not primarily the result of the natural difficulties which follow a great war. It is chiefly due to the fact that one nation has not only refused to cooperate in the establishment of a just and honorable peace but\u2014even worse\u2014has actively sought to prevent it.\"<ref name=\"Clerk.house.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/highlights.html?action=view&intID=345 |title=President Harry S.

Others thought he had not been forceful enough to contain the USSR. \"What [Truman] said fell short of being tough\", noted Representative [[Edward E. Cox|Eugene Cox]], a Democrat from Georgia, \"there is no prospect of ever winning Russian cooperation.\" Despite its reservations, the 80th Congress implemented Truman's requests, further escalating the Cold War with the USSR.<ref name=\"Clerk.house.gov\"/>\n\nTruman signed the Economic Cooperation Act into law on April 3, 1948; the Act established the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA) to administer the program. ECA was headed by economic cooperation administrator [[Paul G. Hoffman]]. In the same year, the participating countries (Austria, [[Belgium]], Denmark, France, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece, [[Iceland]], Ireland, Italy, [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], Norway, Sweden, [[Switzerland]], Turkey, and the United States) signed an accord establishing a master financial-aid-coordinating agency, the [[Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] (later called the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or [[OECD]]), which was headed by Frenchman [[Robert Marjolin]].\n\n==Implementation==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Marshall plan page 1.jpg|thumb|First page of the Marshall Plan]]\nThe first substantial aid went to [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] in January 1947, which were seen as the front line of the battle against communist expansion, and were already receiving aid under the [[Truman Doctrine]]. Initially, Britain had supported the anti-communist factions in those countries, but due to its dire economic condition it decided to pull out and in February 1947 requested the US to continue its efforts.<ref>Alan Bullock, ''Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary'' (1983) pp 368-9; Arnold Offner, ''Another Such Victory'' (2002) p 197; Denise M. Bostdorff, ''Proclaiming the Truman Doctrine'' (2008) p 51</ref> The ECA formally began operation in July 1948.\n\nThe ECA's official [[mission statement]] was to give a boost to the European economy: to promote European production, to bolster European currency, and to facilitate international trade, especially with the United States, whose economic interest required Europe to become wealthy enough to import US goods. Another unofficial goal of ECA (and of the Marshall Plan) was the containment of growing Soviet influence in Europe, evident especially in the growing strength of [[communist party|communist parties]] in Czechoslovakia, France, and Italy.\n\nThe Marshall Plan money was transferred to the governments of the European nations. The funds were jointly administered by the local governments and the ECA. Each European [[capital (political)|capital]] had an ECA envoy, generally a prominent American businessman, who would advise on the process. The cooperative allocation of funds was encouraged, and panels of government, business, and labor leaders were convened to examine the economy and see where aid was needed.\n\nThe Marshall Plan aid was mostly used for the purchase of goods from the United States. The European nations had all but exhausted their [[foreign-exchange reserves]] during the war, and the Marshall Plan aid represented almost their sole means of importing goods from abroad. At the start of the plan, these imports were mainly much-needed staples such as food and fuel, but later the purchases turned towards reconstruction needs as was originally intended. In the latter years, under pressure from the United States Congress and with the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], an increasing amount of the aid was spent on rebuilding the militaries of Western Europe. Of the some $13 billion allotted by mid-1951, $3.4 billion had been spent on imports of raw materials and semi-manufactured products; $3.2 billion on food, feed, and fertilizer; $1.9 billion on machines, vehicles, and equipment; and $1.6 billion on fuel.<ref>Hogan, p.415</ref>\n\nAlso established were [[counterpart fund]]s, which used Marshall Plan aid to establish funds in the local currency. According to ECA rules, recipients had to invest 60% of these funds in industry. This was prominent in Germany, where these government-administered funds played a crucial role in lending money to private enterprises which would spend the money rebuilding. These funds played a central role in the reindustrialization of Germany. In 1949\u201350, for instance, 40% of the investment in the German coal industry was by these funds.<ref>Crafts, Toniolo, p.464</ref>\n\nThe companies were obligated to repay the loans to the government, and the money would then be lent out to another group of businesses. This process has continued to this day in the guise of the state-owned [[KfW]] bank, (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute). The Special Fund, then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry, was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971. In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion. Through the revolving loan system, the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low-interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion. The other 40% of the counterpart funds were used to pay down the debt, stabilize the currency, or invest in non-industrial projects. France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds, using them to reduce the budget deficit. In France, and most other countries, the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues, and not recycled as in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Netherlands received US aid for economic recovery in the Netherlands Indies. However, in January 1949, the American government suspended this aid in response to the Dutch efforts to restore colonial rule in Indonesia during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], and it implicitly threatened to suspend Marshall aid to the Netherlands if the Dutch government continued to oppose the independence of [[Indonesia]].<ref>Van der Eng (1988).</ref>\n\nAt the time the United States was a significant oil producing nation \u2014 one of the goals of the Marshall Plan was for Europe to use oil in place of coal, but the Europeans wanted to buy [[crude oil]] and use the Marshall Plan funds to build refineries instead. However, when independent American oil companies complained, the ECA denied funds for European refinery construction.<ref>{{Cite book |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group  |isbn= 978-0-275-94562-6 |last= Pelletiere  |first= Stephen C. |title= Iraq and the International Oil System: Why America Went to War in the Gulf |chapter= 3.

The plaque reads: \"Emergency Program Berlin - with the help of the Marshall Plan\"]]\n[[File:MarshallDonkey.jpg|thumb|US aid to Greece under the Marshall Plan]]\n\nA high priority was increasing industrial productivity in Europe, which proved one of the more successful aspects of the Marshall Plan.<ref>Sissel Bjerrum Fossat,  \"American Lessons in Mass Production and Mass Consumption: Danish Study Visits to the United States under the Marshall Plan's Technical Assistance Programme.\" ''Contemporary European History'' 27.4 (2018): 582-600.</ref> The US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) contributed heavily to the success of the Technical Assistance Program. The United States Congress passed a law on June 7, 1940 that allowed the BLS to \"make continuing studies of labor productivity\"<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 44\">{{cite journal|last=Wasser|first=Solidelle|first2=Michael |last2=Dolfman|title=BLS and the Marshall Plan: the forgotten story|journal=Monthly Labor Review|year=2005|pages=44|ref=harv}}</ref> and appropriated funds for the creation of a Productivity and Technological Development Division. The BLS could then use its expertise in the field of productive efficiency to implement a productivity drive in each Western European country receiving Marshall Plan aid.  Counterpart funds were used to finance large-scale tours of American industry.  France, for example, sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores, and offices.  They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers, and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work, compared to 30 months in France.<ref>Richard, F. Kuisel, ''Seducing the French: The Dilemma of Americanization'' (1993) pp 70 \u2013 102.</ref>\n\nBy implementing technological literature surveys and organized plant visits, American economists, statisticians, and engineers were able to educate European manufacturers in statistical measurement. The goal of the statistical and technical assistance from the Americans was to increase productive efficiency of European manufacturers in all industries.\n\nTo conduct this analysis, the BLS performed two types of productivity calculations. First, they used existing data to calculate how much a worker produces per hour of work\u2014the average output rate. Second, they compared the existing output rates in a particular country to output rates in other nations. By performing these calculations across all industries, the BLS was able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each country's manufacturing and industrial production. From that, the BLS could recommend technologies (especially statistical) that each individual nation could implement. Often, these technologies came from the United States; by the time the Technical Assistance Program began, the United States used statistical technologies \"more than a generation ahead of what [the Europeans] were using\".<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 44\"/>\n\nThe BLS used these statistical technologies to create Factory Performance Reports for Western European nations. The American government sent hundreds of technical advisers to Europe to observe workers in the field. This on-site analysis made the Factory Performance Reports especially helpful to the manufacturers. In addition, the Technical Assistance Program funded 24,000 European engineers, leaders, and industrialists to visit America and tour America's factories, mines, and manufacturing plants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Gordon|title=Lessons for Today from the Marshall Plan|journal=CIPE.ORG Feature Service: Technical Paper Series|year=2002|page=2|ref=harv}}</ref> This way, the European visitors would be able to return to their home countries and implement the technologies used in the United States. The analyses in the Factory Performance Reports and the \"hands-on\" experience had by the European productivity teams effectively identified productivity deficiencies in European industries; from there, it became clearer how to make European production more effective.\n\nBefore the Technical Assistance Program even went into effect, United States Secretary of Labor [[Maurice J. Tobin|Maurice Tobin]] expressed his confidence in American productivity and technology to both American and European economic leaders. He urged that the United States play a large role in improving European productive efficiency by providing four recommendations for the program's administrators:\n# That BLS productivity personnel should serve on American-European councils for productivity;\n# that productivity targets (based on American productivity standards) can and should be implemented to increase productivity;\n# that there should be a general exchange and publication of information; and\n# that the \"technical abstract\" service should be the central source of information.<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 49\">{{cite journal|last=Wasser|first=Solidelle|first2=Michael |last2=Dolfman|title=BLS and the Marshall Plan: the forgotten story|journal=Monthly Labor Review|year=2005|pages=49|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe effects of the Technical Assistance Program were not limited to improvements in productive efficiency. While the thousands of European leaders took their work/study trips to the United States, they were able to observe a number of aspects of American society as well. The Europeans could watch local, state, and federal governments work together with citizens in a pluralist society. They observed a democratic society with open universities and civic societies in addition to more advanced factories and manufacturing plants. The Technical Assistance Program allowed Europeans to bring home many types of American ideas.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Gordon|title=Lessons for Today from the Marshall Plan|journal=CIPE.ORG Feature Service: Technical Paper Series|year=2002|pages=2\u20133|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAnother important aspect of the Technical Assistance Program was its low cost. While $19.4 billion was allocated for capital costs in the Marshall Plan, the Technical Assistance Program only required $300 million. Only one-third of that $300 million cost was paid by the United States.<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 49\"/>\n\n[[File:DBP 1960 344 George C.

Steel plants thus made redundant were to be dismantled.

Note the pivotal position of the American flag. The blue and white flag between those of Germany and Italy is a version of the [[Free Territory of Trieste|Trieste]] flag with the UN blue rather than the traditional red.]]\n\nThe Marshall Plan was originally scheduled to end in 1953. Any effort to extend it was halted by the growing cost of the [[Korean War]] and rearmament. American Republicans hostile to the plan had also gained seats in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1950|1950 Congressional elections]], and conservative opposition to the plan was revived. Thus the plan ended in 1951, though various other forms of American aid to Europe continued afterwards.\n\nThe years 1948 to 1952 saw the fastest period of growth in European history. Industrial production increased by 35%. Agricultural production substantially surpassed pre-war levels.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" /> The poverty and starvation of the immediate postwar years disappeared, and Western Europe embarked upon an unprecedented two decades of growth that saw standards of living increase dramatically. Additionally, the long-term effect of economic integration raised European income levels substantially, by nearly 20 percent by the mid-1970s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Badinger|first=Harald|date=2005|title=Growth effects of economic integration: evidence from the EU member states|url=|journal=Review of World Economics|volume=141|pages=50\u201378|doi=10.1007/s10290-005-0015-y}}</ref> There is some debate among historians over how much this should be credited to the Marshall Plan. Most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived Europe, as evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway. Most believe that the Marshall Plan sped this recovery, but did not initiate it. Many argue that the structural adjustments that it forced were of great importance. Economic historians [[J. Bradford DeLong]] and [[Barry Eichengreen]] call it \"history's most successful structural adjustment program.\"<ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\" />  One effect of the plan was that it subtly \"Americanized\" European countries, especially Austria, through new exposure to American popular culture, including the growth in influence of Hollywood movies and rock n' roll.<ref>Bischof, Pelinka and Stiefel 174-175</ref>\n\nThe political effects of the Marshall Plan may have been just as important as the economic ones. Marshall Plan aid allowed the nations of Western Europe to relax austerity measures and rationing, reducing discontent and bringing political stability. The communist influence on Western Europe was greatly reduced, and throughout the region, communist parties faded in popularity in the years after the Marshall Plan. The trade relations fostered by the Marshall Plan helped forge the North Atlantic alliance that would persist throughout the Cold War in the form of NATO. At the same time, the nonparticipation of the states of the Eastern Bloc was one of the first clear signs that the continent was now divided.\n\nThe Marshall Plan also played an important role in European integration. Both the Americans and many of the European leaders felt that European integration was necessary to secure the peace and prosperity of Europe, and thus used Marshall Plan guidelines to foster integration. In some ways, this effort failed, as the [[OEEC]] never grew to be more than an agent of economic cooperation. Rather, it was the separate [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which did not include Britain, that would eventually grow into the [[European Union]]. However, the OEEC served as both a testing and training ground for the structures that would later be used by the [[European Economic Community]]. The Marshall Plan, linked into the [[Bretton Woods system]], also mandated free trade throughout the region.\n\nWhile some historians today feel some of the praise for the Marshall Plan is exaggerated, it is still viewed favorably and many thus feel that a similar project would help other areas of the world. After the fall of communism, several proposed a \"Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe\" that would help revive that region. Others have proposed a Marshall Plan for Africa to help that continent, and US [[Al Gore|Vice President Al Gore]] suggested a [[Global Marshall Plan]].<ref>Marshall Plan style proposals for other parts of the world have been a perennial idea. For instance, [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] have referred to their African aid goals as \"a Marshall Plan\". [https://www.theguardian.com/g8/story/0,13365,1498591,00.html Guardian.co.uk] After the end of the Cold War many felt Eastern Bloc needed a rebuilding plan.</ref> \"Marshall Plan\" has become a metaphor for any very large-scale government program that is designed to solve a specific social problem. It is usually used when calling for federal spending to correct a perceived failure of the private sector.\n\nNicholas Shaxson comments: \u201cIt is widely believed  that the plan worked by offsetting European countries\u2019 yawning deficits. But its real importance ... was simply to compensate for the US failure to institute controls on inflows of hot money from Europe. ... American post-war aid was less than the money flowing in the other direction.\u201c<ref>Nicholas Shaxson ''Treasure Islands - tax havens and the men who stole the world''.  Vintage press, 2012. chapter 4.</ref>  European hot money inflated the US dollar exchange rate, to the disadvantage of US exporters.\n\n==Repayment==\nThe Marshall Plan money was in the form of grants from the U.S. Treasury that did not have to be repaid.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Organisation for European Economic Co-operation|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] took the leading role in allocating funds, and the OEEC arranged for the transfer of the goods. The American supplier was paid in dollars, which were credited against the appropriate European Recovery Program funds. The European recipient, however, was not given the goods as a gift but had to pay for them (usually on credit) in local currency. These payments were kept by the European government involved in a special '''counterpart fund.''' This counterpart money, in turn, could be used by the government for further investment projects. Five percent of the counterpart money was paid to the US to cover the administrative costs of the ERP.<ref>Harry Bayard Price, ''The Marshall Plan and its Meaning'' (1955), p. 106</ref> In addition to ERP grants, the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] (an agency of the US government) at the same time made long-term loans at low interest rates to finance major purchases in the US, all of which were repaid.\n\nIn the case of Germany, there also were 16 billion marks of debts from the 1920s which had defaulted in the 1930s, but which Germany decided to repay to restore its reputation. This money was owed to government and private banks in the US, France, and Britain. Another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the US. Under the [[Agreement on German External Debts|London Debts Agreement]] of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50% to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.<ref>Timothy W.

The only major Western European nation excluded was [[Francisco Franco|Francisco Franco's]] Spain, which was highly unpopular in Washington.  With the escalation of the Cold War, the United States reconsidered its position, and in 1951 embraced Spain as an ally, encouraged by Franco's aggressive [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] policies. Over the next decade, a considerable amount of American aid would go to Spain, but less than its neighbors had received under the Marshall Plan.<ref>Crafts, Toniolo, p.363</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union had been as badly affected as any part of the world by the war. The Soviets imposed large [[War reparations|reparations]] payments on the Axis allies that were in its sphere of influence. [[Austria]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and especially [[East Germany]] were forced to pay vast sums and ship large amounts of supplies to the USSR. These reparation payments meant the Soviet Union itself received about the same as 16 European countries received in total from Marshall Plan aid.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2db3MMq1W70C&pg=PA16&dq=%22soviet+union%22+%22marshall+plan%22+reparations&cd=19#v=onepage&q=%22soviet%20union%22%20%22marshall%20plan%22%20reparations&f=false|title=The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: the thorny path from political to economic integration|page=16|publisher=M.E.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union would in return ship raw materials such as food and timber to the western zones. In view of the Soviet failure to do so, the western zones halted the shipments east, ostensibly on a temporary basis, although they were never resumed. It was later shown that the main reason for halting shipments east was not the behavior of the USSR but rather the recalcitrant behavior of France.<ref>John Gimbel, \"The American Reparations Stop in Germany: An Essay on the Political Uses of History\"</ref> Examples of material received by the USSR were equipment from the [[Kugel-Fischer]] ballbearing plant at [[Schweinfurt]], the [[Daimler-Benz]] underground aircraft-engine plant at [[Obrigheim]], the [[Deschimag]] shipyards at [[Bremen-Weser]], and the [[Gendorf powerplant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3403 |title=GHDI&nbsp;\u2014 Document&nbsp;\u2014 Page |publisher=Germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org |accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/omg1946n039/reference/history.omg1946n039.i0007.pdf |title=WISC.edu |accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\nThe USSR did establish [[COMECON]] as a riposte to the Marshall Plan to deliver aid for Eastern Bloc countries, but this was complicated by the Soviet efforts to manage their own recovery from the war. The members of Comecon looked to the Soviet Union for oil; in turn, they provided machinery, equipment, agricultural goods, industrial goods, and consumer goods to the Soviet Union. Economic recovery in the East was much slower than in the West, resulting in the formation of the [[shortage economy|shortage economies]] and a gap in wealth between East and West. Finland, which the USSR forbade to join the Marshall Plan and which was required to give large reparations to the USSR, saw its economy recover to pre-war levels in 1947.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Europe/Finland-ECONOMY.html |title=Economy&nbsp;\u2014 Finland |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref> France, which received billions of dollars through the Marshall Plan, similarly saw its average income per person return to almost pre-war level by 1949.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=kGCfmmlGtPEC&pg=PA189&dq=%22marshall+plan%22+france+recover+pre-war+#PPA202,M1|title=Postwar Economic Reconstruction and Lessons for the East Today|last=De Long|first=J.|page=202|year=1993|chapter=The Marshall Plan|author2=Barry Eichengreen|isbn=9780262041362}}</ref> By mid-1948 industrial production in Poland, Hungary, [[Bulgaria]], and [[Czechoslovakia]] had recovered to a level somewhat above pre-war level.<ref>{{cite journal|jstor=3017377 |title=Economic Changes in Eastern Bloc.

The purpose of this campaign was to sway public opinion in their direction and to inform the common person of what the Marshall Plan was and what the Plan would ultimately do. They spent months attempting to convince Americans that their cause was just and that they should embrace the higher taxes that would come in the foreseeable future.<ref>{{Cite book|title=In Search of a Usable Past: The Marshall Plan and Postwar Reconstruction Today|last=Machado|first=Barry|publisher=George C Marshall Foundation|year=2007|isbn=9780935524062|location=Lexington, VA|pages=}}</ref>\n\nA copious amount of propaganda ended up being highly effective in swaying public opinion towards supporting the Marshall Plan.

Americans swapped their isolationist ideals for a much more global internationalist ideology after World War II.\n\n=== Polling data ===\nIn a [[NORC at the University of Chicago|National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC) poll taken in April 1945, a cross-section of Americans were asked, \"If our government keeps on sending lendlease materials, which we may not get paid for, to friendly countries for about three years after the war, do you think this will mean more jobs or fewer jobs for most Americans, or won't it make any difference?\" 75% said the same or more jobs; 10% said fewer.<ref>Hadley Cantril and Mildred Strunk, ''Public Opinion, 1935-1946'' (1947) p 414.</ref>\n\nBefore proposing anything to Congress in 1947, the Truman administration made an elaborate effort to organize public opinion in favor of the Marshall Plan spending, reaching out to numerous national organizations representing business, labor, farmers, women, and other interest groups. Political scientist Ralph Levering points out that:\n\n<blockquote>Mounting large public relations campaigns and supporting private groups such as the Citizens [[Committee for the Marshall Plan]], the administration carefully built public and bipartisan Congressional support before bringing these measures to a vote.<ref>Ralph B. Levering, ''The Public and American Foreign Policy, 1918-1978'' (1978) pp 98-99.</ref></blockquote>\n\nPublic opinion polls in 1947 consistently showed strong support for the Marshall plan among Americans.  Furthermore, Gallup  polls in England, France, and Italy showed favorable majorities over 60%   <ref>George Gallup, ed., ''The Gallup Poll: Public Opinion 1935-1971'' (1972) vol 1 pp 691, 708-9, 722</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\n\n===Laissez-faire criticism===\n[[Laissez-faire]] criticism of the Marshall Plan came from a number of economists. [[Wilhelm R\u00f6pke]], who influenced [[Federal Minister of Economics and Technology (Germany)|German Minister for Economy]] [[Ludwig Erhard]] in his [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic recovery program]], believed recovery would be found in eliminating [[central planning]] and restoring a market economy in Europe, especially in those countries which had adopted more [[fascism|fascist]] and [[corporatism|corporatist]] economic policies. R\u00f6pke criticized the Marshall Plan for forestalling the transition to the free market by subsidizing the current, failing systems. Erhard put R\u00f6pke's theory into practice and would later credit R\u00f6pke's influence for West Germany's preeminent success.<ref>Erhard, p. 22; also, Zmirak</ref>\n\n[[Henry Hazlitt]] criticized the Marshall Plan in his 1947 book ''Will Dollars Save the World?'', arguing that economic recovery comes through savings, capital accumulation, and private enterprise, and not through large cash subsidies. [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] criticized the Marshall Plan in 1951, believing that \"the American subsidies make it possible for [Europe's] governments to conceal partially the disastrous effects of the various socialist measures they have adopted\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/story/2321 |title=von Mises |publisher=Mises.org |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> Some critics and Congressmen at the time believed that America was giving too much aid to Europe. America had already given Europe $9 billion in other forms of help in previous years. The Marshall Plan gave another $13 billion, equivalent to about $100 billion in 2010 value.<ref>New York: Palgrave, 2001. 1-3.</ref>\n\n===Modern criticism===\nHowever, its role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived Europe since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway. The Marshall Plan grants were provided at a rate that was not much higher in terms of flow than the previous [[UNRRA]] aid and represented less than 3% of the combined [[national income]] of the recipient countries between 1948 and 1951,<ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\" /> which would mean an increase in [[GDP]] growth of only 0.3%.<ref name=\"Nicholas Crafts 6\"/> In addition, there is no correlation between the amount of aid received and the speed of recovery: both [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] received more aid, but [[West Germany]] recovered significantly faster.<ref name=\"Nicholas Crafts 6\"/>\n\nCriticism of the Marshall Plan became prominent among historians of the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] school, such as [[Walter LaFeber]], during the 1960s and 1970s. They argued that the plan was American economic [[imperialism]] and that it was an attempt to gain control over Western Europe just as the Soviets controlled Eastern Europe economically through the [[Comecon]]. In a review of West Germany's economy from 1945 to 1951, German analyst [[Werner Abelshauser]] concluded that \"foreign aid was not crucial in starting the recovery or in keeping it going\". The economic recoveries of France, Italy, and Belgium, Cowen argues, began a few months before the flow of US money. Belgium, the country that relied earliest and most heavily on free-market economic policies after its liberation in 1944, experienced swift recovery and avoided the severe housing and food shortages seen in the rest of continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/research/articles/vasquez-030509.html |title=A Marshall Plan for Iraq? |publisher=Cato.org |date=May 9, 2003 |accessdate=2009-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122130923/https://www.cato.org/research/articles/vasquez-030509.html |archivedate=January 22, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nFormer US Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank [[Alan Greenspan]] gives most credit to German Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]] for Europe's economic recovery.

He states that it was Erhard's reductions in economic regulations that permitted Germany's miraculous recovery, and that these policies also contributed to the recoveries of many other European countries.

The $17 billion was in the context of a US GDP of $258 billion in 1948, and on top of $17 billion in American aid to Europe between the end of the war and the start of the Plan that is counted separately from the Marshall Plan.<ref>Milward (1984) p. 46</ref> The Marshall Plan was replaced by the [[Mutual Security Act|Mutual Security Plan]] at the end of 1951; that new plan gave away about $7.5 billion annually until 1961 when it was replaced by another program.<ref>{{cite book|last=Mills|first=Nicolaus|title=Winning the Peace: the Marshall Plan and America's Coming of Age as a Superpower|year=2008|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-470-09755-7|page=[https://archive.org/details/winningpeacemars00mill/page/195 195]|url=https://archive.org/details/winningpeacemars00mill/page/195}}</ref>\n\nThe ERP addressed each of the obstacles to postwar recovery. The plan looked to the future and did not focus on the destruction caused by the war.

Sustained [[Strategic bombing during World War II|aerial bombardment during the war]] had badly damaged most major cities, and industrial facilities were especially hard-hit.<ref>Tom Buchanan, ''Europe's Troubled Peace 1945\u20132000,'' (2006) ch 1</ref> The region's trade flows had been thoroughly disrupted; millions were in refugee camps living on aid from the United States, which was provided in the guise of the [[United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration]] and other agencies. The [[United Nations]] had been approved by a three-month conference that bookended [[Victory in Europe]]. Food shortages were severe, especially in the harsh [[Winter of 1946\u201347 in the United Kingdom|winter of 1946\u201347]]. From July 1945 through June 1946, the United States shipped 16.5 million tons of food, primarily wheat, to Europe and Japan. It amounted to one-sixth of the American food supply and provided 35 trillion calories, enough to provide 400 calories a day for one year to 300 million people.<ref>Allen J. Matusow, ''Farm Policies and Politics in the Truman Administration'' (1967) pp 35-36.</ref>\n\nEspecially damaged was transportation infrastructure, as railways, bridges, and docks had been specifically targeted by airstrikes, while much merchant shipping had been sunk. Although most small towns and villages had not suffered as much damage, the destruction of transportation left them economically isolated. None of these problems could be easily remedied, as most nations engaged in the war had exhausted their treasuries in the process.<ref>Tony Judt, ''Postwar: a History of Europe since 1945'' (2005) ch 1</ref>\n\nThe only major powers whose infrastructure had not been significantly harmed in World War II were the United States and Canada. They were much more prosperous than before the war but exports were a small factor in their economy. Much of the Marshall Plan aid would be used by the Europeans to buy manufactured goods and raw materials from the United States and Canada.<ref>{{Cite book | author = James T.

The [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) date from this time.

The [[GATT]] was first conceived around that time too.{{citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Slow recovery===\nMost of Europe's economies were recovering slowly, as unemployment and food shortages led to strikes and unrest in several nations.

Hogan, ''The Marshall Plan'', p. 30.</ref> Exceptions were the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and France, where by the end of 1947 production had already been restored to pre-war levels before the Marshall Plan.

In the West, bombing had destroyed 5,000,000 houses and apartments, and 12,000,000 refugees from the east had crowded in.<ref name=\"Deither Raff 1988 p 335\">Deither Raff, ''A History of Germany'' (1988) p. 335</ref> Food production was two-thirds of the pre-war level in 1946\u201348, while normal grain and meat shipments no longer arrived from the East. The drop in food production can be attributed to a drought that killed a major portion of the wheat crop while a severe winter destroyed the majority of the wheat crop the following year. This caused most Europeans to rely on a 1,500 calorie per day diet.<ref>Marta Schaff, \"Marshall Plan\" p.1</ref> Furthermore, the large shipments of food stolen from occupied nations during the war no longer reached Germany.

The [[Deutsche Mark#Economics of 1948 currency reform|currency reform in 1948]] was headed by the military government and helped Germany to restore stability by encouraging production. The reform revalued old currency and deposits and introduced new currency. Taxes were also reduced and Germany prepared to remove economic barriers.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Price|first1=Harry Bayard|title=The Marshall Plan and Its Meaning|url=https://archive.org/details/marshallplanitsm00pric|url-access=registration|date=1955|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca, New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/marshallplanitsm00pric/page/264 264]}}</ref>\n\nDuring the first three years of occupation of Germany, the UK and US vigorously pursued a [[Industrial plans for Germany|military disarmament program in Germany]], partly by removal of equipment but mainly through an import embargo on raw materials, part of the [[Morgenthau Plan]] approved by President [[Franklin D.

The emerging doctrine of [[containment]] (as opposed to [[rollback]]) argued that the United States needed to substantially aid non-communist countries to stop the spread of Soviet influence. There was also some hope that the Eastern Bloc nations would join the plan, and thus be pulled out of the emerging Soviet bloc, but that did not happen.\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-B0527-0001-753, Krefeld, Hungerwinter, Demonstration.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|The hunger-winter of 1947, thousands protest in West Germany against the disastrous food situation (March 31, 1947).

In July 1947 Marshall scrapped [[JCS 1067|Joint Chiefs of Staff Directive 1067]] implemented as part of the [[Morgenthau Plan]] under the personal supervision of Roosevelt's treasury secretary [[Henry Morgenthau, Jr.]], which had decreed \"take no steps looking toward the economic rehabilitation of Germany [or] designed to maintain or strengthen the German economy.\" Thereafter, JCS 1067 was supplanted by JCS 1779, stating that \"an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany.\"<ref name=\"beschloss277\" /> The restrictions placed on German heavy industry production were partly ameliorated; permitted steel production levels were raised from 25% of pre-war capacity to a new limit placed at 50% of pre-war capacity.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,887417,00.html Pas de Pagaille!] ''Time'', July 28, 1947.</ref>\n\nWith a [[Greek Civil War#Confrontation: 1944|communist, although non-Soviet, insurgency]] threatening Greece, and Britain financially unable to continue its aid, the President announced his [[Truman Doctrine]] on March 12, 1947, \"to support free peoples who are resisting attempted subjugation by armed minorities or by outside pressures\", with an aid request for consideration and decision, concerning Greece and Turkey. Also in March 1947, former US President [[Herbert Hoover]], in one of [[The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria|his reports from Germany]], argued for a change in US occupation policy, among other things stating:\n\n<blockquote>There is the illusion that the New Germany left after the annexations can be reduced to a 'pastoral state' (Morgenthau's vision).

Over $14 billion was spent or loaned during the postwar period through the end of 1947 and is not counted as part of the Marshall Plan. Much of this aid was designed to restore infrastructure and help refugees. Britain, for example, received an emergency loan of $3.75 billion.<ref>''Statistical Abstract of the United States: 1949'' p. 846 [http://www2.census.gov/prod2/statcomp/documents/1949-12.pdf online]</ref>\n\nThe [[United Nations]] also launched a series of humanitarian and relief efforts almost wholly funded by the United States. These efforts had important effects, but they lacked any central organization and planning, and failed to meet many of Europe's more fundamental needs.<ref>[[Tony Judt]], in ''The Marshall Plan: Fifty Years After,'' edited by Martin Schain, p. 4.</ref> Already in 1943, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) was founded to provide relief to areas liberated from Germany. UNRRA provided billions of dollars of rehabilitation aid and helped about 8 million refugees. It ceased operation of [[displaced persons camp]]s in Europe in 1947; many of its functions were transferred to several UN agencies.\n\n==Soviet negotiations==\nAfter Marshall's appointment in January 1947, administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets in their occupied zone.<ref name=\"wettig116\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=116}}</ref> Molotov refrained from supplying accounts of Soviet assets.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=df48c91e-669e-40f0-a01a-4b17aefe551f%2540sessionmgr112&vid=0&hid=127&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%253d%253d&preview=false |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-03-21 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170510123130/http://eds.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail/detail?sid=df48c91e-669e-40f0-a01a-4b17aefe551f%2540sessionmgr112&vid=0&hid=127&bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%253d%253d&preview=false#db=khh&AN=17998437 |archive-date=2017-05-10 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The Soviets took a punitive approach, pressing for a delay rather than an acceleration in economic rehabilitation, demanding unconditional fulfillment of all prior reparation claims, and pressing for progress toward nationwide socioeconomic transformation.<ref name=\"wettig117\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=117}}</ref>\n\nAfter six weeks of negotiations, Molotov rejected all of the American and British proposals.<ref name=\"wettig117\"/> Molotov also rejected the counter-offer to scrap the British-American \"Bizonia\" and to include the Soviet zone within the newly constructed Germany.<ref name=\"wettig117\"/>  Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin to explain that the United States could not possibly abandon its position on Germany, while Stalin expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems.<ref name=\"wettig117\"/>\n\n==Marshall's speech==\n{{Wikisource|The Marshall Plan Speech}}\nAfter the adjournment of the Moscow conference following six weeks of failed discussions with the Soviets regarding a potential German reconstruction, the United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer. To clarify the American position, a major address by Secretary of State [[George Marshall]] was planned. Marshall gave the address at Harvard University on June 5, 1947. He offered American aid to promote European recovery and reconstruction. The speech described the dysfunction of the European economy and presented a rationale for US aid.\n\n<blockquote>The modern system of the division of labor upon which the exchange of products is based is in danger of breaking down.&nbsp;... Aside from the demoralizing effect on the world at large and the possibilities of disturbances arising as a result of the desperation of the people concerned, the consequences to the economy of the United States should be apparent to all. It is logical that the United States should do whatever it is able to do to assist in the return of normal economic health to the world, without which there can be no political stability and no assured peace. Our policy is not directed against any country, but against hunger, poverty, desperation and chaos. Any government that is willing to assist in recovery will find full co-operation on the part of the United States. Its purpose should be the revival of a working economy in the world so as to permit the emergence of political and social conditions in which free institutions can exist.<ref>{{cite book|author=Jussi M.

He offered aid, but the European countries had to organize the program themselves.\n\nThe speech, written by [[Charles Bohlen]], contained virtually no details and no numbers. More a proposal than a plan, it was a challenge to European leaders to cooperate and coordinate.  It asked Europeans to create their own plan for rebuilding Europe, indicating the United States would then fund this plan. The administration felt that the plan would likely be unpopular among many Americans, and the speech was mainly directed at a European audience. In an attempt to keep the speech out of American papers, journalists were not contacted, and on the same day, Truman called a press conference to take away headlines. In contrast, Dean Acheson, an Under Secretary of State, was dispatched to contact the European media, especially the British media, and the speech was read in its entirety on the [[BBC]].<ref>{{cite book|author=Charles L.

The two agreed that it would be necessary to invite the Soviets as the other major allied power. Marshall's speech had explicitly included an invitation to the Soviets, feeling that excluding them would have been a sign of distrust. State Department officials, however, knew that [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]] would almost certainly not participate and that any plan that would send large amounts of aid to the Soviets was unlikely to get Congressional approval.\n\n===Initial reactions===\nSpeaking at the Paris Peace Conference on October 10, 1946 Molotov had already stated Soviet fears: \"If American capital was given a free hand in the small states ruined  and enfeebled by the war [it] would buy up the local industries, appropriate the more attractive Rumanian, Yugoslav ... enterprises and would become the master in these small states.<ref>McCauley, Martin, ''Origins of the Cold War 1941-1949'', Routledge, 2015, {{ISBN|9781317362470}}, 244 p., p. 147</ref>\" While the Soviet ambassador in Washington suspected that the Marshall Plan could lead to the creation of an anti-Soviet bloc, Stalin was open to the offer.<ref name=\"wettig138\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=138}}</ref> He directed that\u2014in negotiations to be held in Paris regarding the aid\u2014countries in the Eastern Bloc should not reject economic conditions being placed upon them.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> Stalin only changed his outlook when he learned that (a) credit would only be extended under conditions of economic cooperation and, (b) aid would also be extended to Germany in total, an eventuality which Stalin thought would hamper the Soviets' ability to exercise influence in western Germany.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/>\n\nInitially, Stalin  maneuvered to kill the Plan, or at least hamper it by means of destructive participation in the Paris talks regarding conditions.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> He quickly realized, however, that this would be impossible after Molotov reported\u2014following his arrival in Paris in July 1947\u2014that conditions for the credit were non-negotiable.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> Looming as just as large a concern was the Czechoslovak eagerness to accept the aid, as well as indications of a similar Polish attitude.<ref name=\"wettig138\"/>\n\nStalin suspected a possibility that these Eastern Bloc countries might defy Soviet directives not to accept the aid, potentially causing a loss of control of the [[Eastern Bloc]].<ref name=\"wettig138\"/> In addition, the most important condition was that every country choosing to take advantage of the plan would need to have its economic situation independently assessed\u2014a level of scrutiny to which the Soviets could not agree.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Bevin and Bidault also insisted that any aid be accompanied by the creation of a unified European economy, something incompatible with the strict Soviet command economy.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Compulsory Eastern Bloc rejection===\nSoviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] left Paris, rejecting the plan.<ref name=\"wettig139\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=139}}</ref> Thereafter, statements were made suggesting a future confrontation with the West, calling the United States both a \"fascizing\" power and the \"center of worldwide reaction and anti-Soviet activity\", with all U.S.-aligned countries branded as enemies.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> The Soviets also then blamed the United States for communist losses in elections in Belgium, France and Italy months earlier, in the spring of 1947.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> It claimed that \"marshallization\" must be resisted and prevented by any means, and that French and Italian communist parties were to take maximum efforts to sabotage the implementation of the Plan.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/> In addition, Western embassies in Moscow were isolated, with their personnel being denied contact with Soviet officials.<ref name=\"wettig139\"/>\n\nOn July 12, a larger meeting was convened in Paris. Every country of Europe was invited, with the exceptions of Spain (a World War II neutral that had sympathized with [[Axis powers]]) and the small states of [[Andorra]], [[San Marino]], [[Monaco]], and [[Liechtenstein]]. The Soviet Union was invited with the understanding that it would likely refuse. The states of the future [[Eastern Bloc]] were also approached, and [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Poland]] agreed to attend. In one of the clearest signs and reflections of tight Soviet control and domination over the region, [[Jan Masaryk]], the foreign minister of Czechoslovakia, was summoned to Moscow and berated by Stalin for considering Czechoslovakia's possible involvement with and joining of the Marshall Plan. The prime minister of Poland, [[J\u00f3zef Cyrankiewicz]], was rewarded by Stalin for his country's rejection of the Plan, which came in the form of the Soviet Union's offer of a lucrative [[trade agreement]] lasting for a period of five years, a grant amounting to the approximate equivalent of $450 million (in 1948; the sum would have been $4.4 billion in 2014<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usinflationcalculator.com/|title=US Inflation Calculator|website=US Inflation Calculator}}</ref>) in the form of long-term credit and loans and the provision of 200,000 tonnes of grain, heavy and manufacturing machinery and factories and heavy industries to Poland.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855998,00.html |title=Carnations&nbsp;\u2014 TIME |magazine=TIME |date=February 9, 1948 |accessdate=2009-02-01}}</ref>\n\nThe Marshall Plan participants were not surprised when the Czechoslovakian and Polish delegations were prevented from attending the Paris meeting.

The Soviet Union's \"alternative\" to the Marshall plan, which was purported to involve Soviet subsidies and trade with western Europe, became known as the [[Molotov Plan]], and later, the [[Comecon]]. In a 1947 speech to the United Nations, Soviet deputy foreign minister [[Andrei Vyshinsky]] said that the Marshall Plan violated the principles of the United Nations. He accused the United States of attempting to impose its will on other independent states, while at the same time using economic resources distributed as relief to needy nations as an instrument of political pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/hist249/course/Documents/vyshinsky_speech_to_un.htm|title=Vyshinsky Speech to U.N.

However, in 1948 [[Tito-Stalin Split|Tito broke decisively with Stalin]] on other issues, making Yugoslavia an independent communist state. Yugoslavia requested American aid. American leaders were internally divided, but finally agreed and began sending money on a small scale in 1949, and on a much larger scale in 1950\u201353.

New York: Free P, 2007.</ref> A [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) report was read at the outset to set the heavily [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] tone, stating now that \"international politics is dominated by the ruling clique of the American imperialists\" which have embarked upon the \"enslavement of the weakened capitalist countries of Europe\".<ref name=\"wettig140\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=140}}</ref> Communist parties were to struggle against the US presence in Europe by any means necessary, including sabotage.<ref name=\"wettig146\"/> The report further claimed that \"reactionary imperialist elements throughout the world, particularly in the United States, in Britain and France, had put particular hope on Germany and Japan, primarily on Hitlerite Germany\u2014first as a force most capable of striking a blow at the Soviet Union\".<ref name=\"wettig142\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=142}}</ref>\n\nReferring to the Eastern Bloc, the report stated that \"the Red Army's liberating role was complemented by an upsurge of the freedom-loving peoples' liberation struggle against the fascist predators and their hirelings.\"<ref name=\"wettig142\"/> It argued that \"the bosses of Wall Street\" were \"tak[ing] the place of Germany, Japan and Italy\".<ref name=\"wettig142\"/> The Marshall Plan was described as \"the American plan for the enslavement of Europe\".<ref name=\"wettig142\"/> It described the world now breaking down \"into basically two camps\u2014the imperialist and antidemocratic camp on the one hand, and the antiimperialist and democratic camp on the other\".<ref name=\"wettig142\"/>\n\nAlthough the Eastern Bloc countries except Czechoslovakia had immediately rejected Marshall Plan aid, Eastern Bloc communist parties were blamed for permitting even minor influence by non-communists in their respective countries during the run up to the Marshall Plan.<ref name=\"wettig148\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=148}}</ref> The meeting's chair, Andrei Zhdanov, who was in permanent radio contact with the Kremlin from whom he received instructions,<ref name=\"wettig140\"/> also castigated communist parties in France and Italy for collaboration with those countries' domestic agendas.<ref name=\"wettig145\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=145}}</ref> Zhdanov warned that if they continued to fail to maintain international contact with Moscow to consult on all matters, \"extremely harmful consequences for the development of the brother parties' work\" would result.<ref name=\"wettig145\"/>\n\nItalian and French communist leaders were prevented by party rules from pointing out that it was actually Stalin who had directed them not to take opposition stances in 1944.<ref name=\"wettig145\"/> The French communist party, as others, was then to redirect its mission to \"destroy capitalist economy\" and that the Soviet Communist Information Bureau ([[Cominform]]) would take control of the French Communist Party's activities to oppose the Marshall Plan.<ref name=\"wettig146\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=146}}</ref> When they asked Zhdanov if they should prepare for armed revolt when they returned home, he did not answer.<ref name=\"wettig146\"/> In a follow-up conversation with Stalin, he explained that an armed struggle would be impossible and that the struggle against the Marshall Plan was to be waged under the slogan of national independence.<ref name=\"wettig147\">{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=147}}</ref>\n\n==Passage in Congress==\nCongress, under the control of conservative Republicans, agreed to the program for multiple reasons. The 20-member conservative isolationist Senate wing of the party, based in the rural Midwest and led by Senator [[Kenneth S. Wherry]] (R-Nebraska), was outmaneuvered by the emerging internationalist wing, led by Senator [[Arthur H. Vandenberg]] (R-Michigan). The opposition argued that it would be \"a wasteful 'operation rat-hole'\"; that it made no sense to oppose communism by supporting the socialist governments in Western Europe; and that American goods would reach Russia and increase its war potential.{{cn|date=February 2020}} Vandenberg, assisted by Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] (R-Massachusetts) admitted there was no certainty that the plan would succeed, but said it would halt economic chaos, sustain Western civilization, and stop further Soviet expansion. Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] (R-Ohio) hedged on the issue. He said it was without economic justification; however, it was \"absolutely necessary\" in \"the world battle against communism.\" In the end, only 17 senators voted against it on March 13, 1948<ref>John C. Campbell, ''The United States in World affairs: 1947-1948'' (1948) pp 500-505; quotes on pages 504, 505.</ref> A bill granting an initial $5 billion passed Congress with strong bipartisan support. Congress would eventually allocate $12.4 billion in aid over the four years of the plan.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Grogin, p.118</ref>\n\nCongress reflected public opinion, which resonated with the ideological argument that communism flourishes in poverty. Truman's own prestige and power had been greatly enhanced by his stunning victory in the [[1948 United States presidential election|1948 election]]. Across America, multiple interest groups, including business, labor, farming, philanthropy, ethnic groups, and religious groups, saw the Marshall Plan as an inexpensive solution to a massive problem, noting it would also help American exports and stimulate the American economy as well. Major newspapers were highly supportive, including such conservative outlets as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]]. Vandenberg made sure of bipartisan support on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Solid Democratic South was highly supportive, the upper Midwest was dubious, but heavily outnumbered. The plan was opposed by conservatives in the rural Midwest, who opposed any major government spending program and were highly suspicious of Europeans.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1952029|title = The Region of Isolationism|journal = The American Political Science Review|volume = 47|issue = 2|pages = 386\u2013401|last1 = Smuckler|first1 = Ralph H.|year = 1953|doi = 10.2307/1952029}}</ref> The plan also had some opponents on the left, led by [[Henry A. Wallace]], the former Vice President. He said the Plan was hostile to the Soviet Union, a subsidy for American exporters, and sure to polarize the world between East and West.<ref>Hogan, p.93.</ref> However, opposition against the Marshall Plan was greatly reduced by the shock of the [[Czechoslovak coup d'\u00e9tat of 1948|Communist coup in Czechoslovakia]] in February 1948. The appointment of the prominent businessman [[Paul G. Hoffman]] as director reassured conservative businessmen that the gigantic sums of money would be handled efficiently.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 446512|title = Influences on the Congressional Decision to Pass the Marshall Plan|journal = The Western Political Quarterly|volume = 21|issue = 1|pages = 51\u201368|last1 = Hitchens|first1 = Harold L.|year = 1968|doi = 10.2307/446512}}</ref><ref>Diane B. Kunz, \"The Marshall Plan reconsidered: a complex of motives.\" ''Foreign Affairs'' 76.3 (1997): 162-170</ref>\n\n==Negotiations==\nTurning the plan into reality required negotiations among the participating nations.  Sixteen nations met in Paris to determine what form the American aid would take, and how it would be divided. The negotiations were long and complex, with each nation having its own interests. France's major concern was that Germany not be rebuilt to its previous threatening power. The [[Benelux]] countries (Belgium, Netherlands, and Luxembourg), despite also suffering under the Nazis, had long been closely linked to the German economy and felt their prosperity depended on its revival. The Scandinavian nations, especially [[Sweden]], insisted that their long-standing trading relationships with the Eastern Bloc nations not be disrupted and that their neutrality not be infringed.<ref name=\"Cini, p.24 in Schain\">Cini, p.24 in Schain</ref>\n\nThe United Kingdom insisted on special status as a longstanding belligerent during the war, concerned that if it were treated equally with the devastated continental powers it would receive virtually no aid. The Americans were pushing the importance of free trade and European unity to form a bulwark against communism. The Truman administration, represented by [[William L. Clayton]], promised the Europeans that they would be free to structure the plan themselves, but the administration also reminded the Europeans that implementation depended on the plan's passage through Congress. A majority of Congress members were committed to free trade and European integration, and were hesitant to spend too much of the money on Germany.<ref name=\"Cini, p.24 in Schain\"/> However, before the Marshall Plan was in effect, France, Austria, and Italy needed immediate aid. On December 17, 1947, the United States agreed to give $40 million to France, Austria, China, and Italy.<ref>Sorel, Eliot, and Pier Carlo Padoan. The Marshall Plan: Lessons Learned for the 21st Century. Paris: OECD, 2008. 15-16. Print.</ref>\n\nAgreement was eventually reached and the Europeans sent a reconstruction plan to Washington, which was formulated and agreed upon by the [[Committee of European Economic Co-operation]] in 1947. In the document, the Europeans asked for $22 billion in aid. Truman cut this to $17 billion in the bill he put to Congress.\nOn March 17, 1948, Truman addressed European security and condemned the Soviet Union before a hastily convened [[Joint Session of Congress]]. Attempting to contain spreading Soviet influence in the Eastern Bloc, Truman asked Congress to restore a peacetime military draft and to swiftly pass the '''Economic Cooperation Act,''' the name given to the Marshall Plan. Of the Soviet Union Truman said, \"The situation in the world today is not primarily the result of the natural difficulties which follow a great war. It is chiefly due to the fact that one nation has not only refused to cooperate in the establishment of a just and honorable peace but\u2014even worse\u2014has actively sought to prevent it.\"<ref name=\"Clerk.house.gov\">{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/art_history/highlights.html?action=view&intID=345 |title=President Harry S.

Others thought he had not been forceful enough to contain the USSR. \"What [Truman] said fell short of being tough\", noted Representative [[Edward E. Cox|Eugene Cox]], a Democrat from Georgia, \"there is no prospect of ever winning Russian cooperation.\" Despite its reservations, the 80th Congress implemented Truman's requests, further escalating the Cold War with the USSR.<ref name=\"Clerk.house.gov\"/>\n\nTruman signed the Economic Cooperation Act into law on April 3, 1948; the Act established the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA) to administer the program. ECA was headed by economic cooperation administrator [[Paul G. Hoffman]]. In the same year, the participating countries (Austria, [[Belgium]], Denmark, France, West Germany, the United Kingdom, Greece, [[Iceland]], Ireland, Italy, [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], Norway, Sweden, [[Switzerland]], Turkey, and the United States) signed an accord establishing a master financial-aid-coordinating agency, the [[Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] (later called the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or [[OECD]]), which was headed by Frenchman [[Robert Marjolin]].\n\n==Implementation==\n{{more citations needed section|date=March 2017}}\n[[File:Marshall plan page 1.jpg|thumb|First page of the Marshall Plan]]\nThe first substantial aid went to [[Greece]] and [[Turkey]] in January 1947, which were seen as the front line of the battle against communist expansion, and were already receiving aid under the [[Truman Doctrine]]. Initially, Britain had supported the anti-communist factions in those countries, but due to its dire economic condition it decided to pull out and in February 1947 requested the US to continue its efforts.<ref>Alan Bullock, ''Ernest Bevin: Foreign Secretary'' (1983) pp 368-9; Arnold Offner, ''Another Such Victory'' (2002) p 197; Denise M. Bostdorff, ''Proclaiming the Truman Doctrine'' (2008) p 51</ref> The ECA formally began operation in July 1948.\n\nThe ECA's official [[mission statement]] was to give a boost to the European economy: to promote European production, to bolster European currency, and to facilitate international trade, especially with the United States, whose economic interest required Europe to become wealthy enough to import US goods. Another unofficial goal of ECA (and of the Marshall Plan) was the containment of growing Soviet influence in Europe, evident especially in the growing strength of [[communist party|communist parties]] in Czechoslovakia, France, and Italy.\n\nThe Marshall Plan money was transferred to the governments of the European nations. The funds were jointly administered by the local governments and the ECA. Each European [[capital (political)|capital]] had an ECA envoy, generally a prominent American businessman, who would advise on the process. The cooperative allocation of funds was encouraged, and panels of government, business, and labor leaders were convened to examine the economy and see where aid was needed.\n\nThe Marshall Plan aid was mostly used for the purchase of goods from the United States. The European nations had all but exhausted their [[foreign-exchange reserves]] during the war, and the Marshall Plan aid represented almost their sole means of importing goods from abroad. At the start of the plan, these imports were mainly much-needed staples such as food and fuel, but later the purchases turned towards reconstruction needs as was originally intended. In the latter years, under pressure from the United States Congress and with the outbreak of the [[Korean War]], an increasing amount of the aid was spent on rebuilding the militaries of Western Europe. Of the some $13 billion allotted by mid-1951, $3.4 billion had been spent on imports of raw materials and semi-manufactured products; $3.2 billion on food, feed, and fertilizer; $1.9 billion on machines, vehicles, and equipment; and $1.6 billion on fuel.<ref>Hogan, p.415</ref>\n\nAlso established were [[counterpart fund]]s, which used Marshall Plan aid to establish funds in the local currency. According to ECA rules, recipients had to invest 60% of these funds in industry. This was prominent in Germany, where these government-administered funds played a crucial role in lending money to private enterprises which would spend the money rebuilding. These funds played a central role in the reindustrialization of Germany. In 1949\u201350, for instance, 40% of the investment in the German coal industry was by these funds.<ref>Crafts, Toniolo, p.464</ref>\n\nThe companies were obligated to repay the loans to the government, and the money would then be lent out to another group of businesses. This process has continued to this day in the guise of the state-owned [[KfW]] bank, (Kreditanstalt f\u00fcr Wiederaufbau, meaning Reconstruction Credit Institute). The Special Fund, then supervised by the Federal Economics Ministry, was worth over DM 10 billion in 1971. In 1997 it was worth DM 23 billion. Through the revolving loan system, the Fund had by the end of 1995 made low-interest loans to German citizens amounting to around DM 140 billion. The other 40% of the counterpart funds were used to pay down the debt, stabilize the currency, or invest in non-industrial projects. France made the most extensive use of counterpart funds, using them to reduce the budget deficit. In France, and most other countries, the counterpart fund money was absorbed into general government revenues, and not recycled as in Germany.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThe Netherlands received US aid for economic recovery in the Netherlands Indies. However, in January 1949, the American government suspended this aid in response to the Dutch efforts to restore colonial rule in Indonesia during the [[Indonesian National Revolution]], and it implicitly threatened to suspend Marshall aid to the Netherlands if the Dutch government continued to oppose the independence of [[Indonesia]].<ref>Van der Eng (1988).</ref>\n\nAt the time the United States was a significant oil producing nation \u2014 one of the goals of the Marshall Plan was for Europe to use oil in place of coal, but the Europeans wanted to buy [[crude oil]] and use the Marshall Plan funds to build refineries instead. However, when independent American oil companies complained, the ECA denied funds for European refinery construction.<ref>{{Cite book |publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group  |isbn= 978-0-275-94562-6 |last= Pelletiere  |first= Stephen C. |title= Iraq and the International Oil System: Why America Went to War in the Gulf |chapter= 3.

The plaque reads: \"Emergency Program Berlin - with the help of the Marshall Plan\"]]\n[[File:MarshallDonkey.jpg|thumb|US aid to Greece under the Marshall Plan]]\n\nA high priority was increasing industrial productivity in Europe, which proved one of the more successful aspects of the Marshall Plan.<ref>Sissel Bjerrum Fossat,  \"American Lessons in Mass Production and Mass Consumption: Danish Study Visits to the United States under the Marshall Plan's Technical Assistance Programme.\" ''Contemporary European History'' 27.4 (2018): 582-600.</ref> The US [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS) contributed heavily to the success of the Technical Assistance Program. The United States Congress passed a law on June 7, 1940 that allowed the BLS to \"make continuing studies of labor productivity\"<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 44\">{{cite journal|last=Wasser|first=Solidelle|first2=Michael |last2=Dolfman|title=BLS and the Marshall Plan: the forgotten story|journal=Monthly Labor Review|year=2005|pages=44|ref=harv}}</ref> and appropriated funds for the creation of a Productivity and Technological Development Division. The BLS could then use its expertise in the field of productive efficiency to implement a productivity drive in each Western European country receiving Marshall Plan aid.  Counterpart funds were used to finance large-scale tours of American industry.  France, for example, sent 500 missions with 4700 businessmen and experts to tour American factories, farms, stores, and offices.  They were especially impressed with the prosperity of American workers, and how they could purchase an inexpensive new automobile for nine months work, compared to 30 months in France.<ref>Richard, F. Kuisel, ''Seducing the French: The Dilemma of Americanization'' (1993) pp 70 \u2013 102.</ref>\n\nBy implementing technological literature surveys and organized plant visits, American economists, statisticians, and engineers were able to educate European manufacturers in statistical measurement. The goal of the statistical and technical assistance from the Americans was to increase productive efficiency of European manufacturers in all industries.\n\nTo conduct this analysis, the BLS performed two types of productivity calculations. First, they used existing data to calculate how much a worker produces per hour of work\u2014the average output rate. Second, they compared the existing output rates in a particular country to output rates in other nations. By performing these calculations across all industries, the BLS was able to identify the strengths and weaknesses of each country's manufacturing and industrial production. From that, the BLS could recommend technologies (especially statistical) that each individual nation could implement. Often, these technologies came from the United States; by the time the Technical Assistance Program began, the United States used statistical technologies \"more than a generation ahead of what [the Europeans] were using\".<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 44\"/>\n\nThe BLS used these statistical technologies to create Factory Performance Reports for Western European nations. The American government sent hundreds of technical advisers to Europe to observe workers in the field. This on-site analysis made the Factory Performance Reports especially helpful to the manufacturers. In addition, the Technical Assistance Program funded 24,000 European engineers, leaders, and industrialists to visit America and tour America's factories, mines, and manufacturing plants.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Gordon|title=Lessons for Today from the Marshall Plan|journal=CIPE.ORG Feature Service: Technical Paper Series|year=2002|page=2|ref=harv}}</ref> This way, the European visitors would be able to return to their home countries and implement the technologies used in the United States. The analyses in the Factory Performance Reports and the \"hands-on\" experience had by the European productivity teams effectively identified productivity deficiencies in European industries; from there, it became clearer how to make European production more effective.\n\nBefore the Technical Assistance Program even went into effect, United States Secretary of Labor [[Maurice J. Tobin|Maurice Tobin]] expressed his confidence in American productivity and technology to both American and European economic leaders. He urged that the United States play a large role in improving European productive efficiency by providing four recommendations for the program's administrators:\n# That BLS productivity personnel should serve on American-European councils for productivity;\n# that productivity targets (based on American productivity standards) can and should be implemented to increase productivity;\n# that there should be a general exchange and publication of information; and\n# that the \"technical abstract\" service should be the central source of information.<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 49\">{{cite journal|last=Wasser|first=Solidelle|first2=Michael |last2=Dolfman|title=BLS and the Marshall Plan: the forgotten story|journal=Monthly Labor Review|year=2005|pages=49|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nThe effects of the Technical Assistance Program were not limited to improvements in productive efficiency. While the thousands of European leaders took their work/study trips to the United States, they were able to observe a number of aspects of American society as well. The Europeans could watch local, state, and federal governments work together with citizens in a pluralist society. They observed a democratic society with open universities and civic societies in addition to more advanced factories and manufacturing plants. The Technical Assistance Program allowed Europeans to bring home many types of American ideas.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Gordon|title=Lessons for Today from the Marshall Plan|journal=CIPE.ORG Feature Service: Technical Paper Series|year=2002|pages=2\u20133|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nAnother important aspect of the Technical Assistance Program was its low cost. While $19.4 billion was allocated for capital costs in the Marshall Plan, the Technical Assistance Program only required $300 million. Only one-third of that $300 million cost was paid by the United States.<ref name=\"Wasser 2005 49\"/>\n\n[[File:DBP 1960 344 George C.

The maximum allowed was set at about 5,800,000 tons of steel a year, equivalent to 25% of the pre-war production level.<ref name=\"autogenerated3\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934360,00.html \"Cornerstone of Steel\"], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', January 21, 1946</ref> The UK, in whose occupation zone most of the steel production was located, had argued for a more limited capacity reduction by placing the production ceiling at 12 million tons of steel per year, but had to submit to the will of the US, France and the Soviet Union (which had argued for a 3 million ton limit). Steel plants thus made redundant were to be dismantled. Germany was to be reduced to the standard of life it had known at the height of the [[Great Depression]] (1932).<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,852764,00.html Cost of Defeat], ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'', April 8, 1946</ref> Consequently, car production was set to 10% of pre-war levels, and the manufacture of other commodities was reduced as well.<ref>[http://www.trumanlibrary.org/whistlestop/study_collections/marshall/large/documents/index.php?pagenumber=10&documentid=22&documentdate=1947-03-24&studycollectionid=mp&nav=OK The President's Economic Mission to Germany and Austria, Report 3] [[Herbert Hoover]], March 1947 pg. 8</ref>\n\nThe first \"[[Industrial plans for Germany|German level of industry]]\" plan was subsequently followed by a number of new ones, the last signed in 1949.

A larger amount was given to the major industrial powers, as the prevailing opinion was that their resuscitation was essential for general European revival. Somewhat more aid per capita was also directed towards the [[Allies of World War II|Allied nations]], with less for those that had been part of the [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]] or remained neutral.

Note the pivotal position of the American flag. The blue and white flag between those of Germany and Italy is a version of the [[Free Territory of Trieste|Trieste]] flag with the UN blue rather than the traditional red.]]\n\nThe Marshall Plan was originally scheduled to end in 1953. Any effort to extend it was halted by the growing cost of the [[Korean War]] and rearmament. American Republicans hostile to the plan had also gained seats in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1950|1950 Congressional elections]], and conservative opposition to the plan was revived. Thus the plan ended in 1951, though various other forms of American aid to Europe continued afterwards.\n\nThe years 1948 to 1952 saw the fastest period of growth in European history. Industrial production increased by 35%. Agricultural production substantially surpassed pre-war levels.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\" /> The poverty and starvation of the immediate postwar years disappeared, and Western Europe embarked upon an unprecedented two decades of growth that saw standards of living increase dramatically. Additionally, the long-term effect of economic integration raised European income levels substantially, by nearly 20 percent by the mid-1970s.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Badinger|first=Harald|date=2005|title=Growth effects of economic integration: evidence from the EU member states|url=|journal=Review of World Economics|volume=141|pages=50\u201378|doi=10.1007/s10290-005-0015-y}}</ref> There is some debate among historians over how much this should be credited to the Marshall Plan. Most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived Europe, as evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway. Most believe that the Marshall Plan sped this recovery, but did not initiate it. Many argue that the structural adjustments that it forced were of great importance. Economic historians [[J. Bradford DeLong]] and [[Barry Eichengreen]] call it \"history's most successful structural adjustment program.\"<ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\" />  One effect of the plan was that it subtly \"Americanized\" European countries, especially Austria, through new exposure to American popular culture, including the growth in influence of Hollywood movies and rock n' roll.<ref>Bischof, Pelinka and Stiefel 174-175</ref>\n\nThe political effects of the Marshall Plan may have been just as important as the economic ones. Marshall Plan aid allowed the nations of Western Europe to relax austerity measures and rationing, reducing discontent and bringing political stability. The communist influence on Western Europe was greatly reduced, and throughout the region, communist parties faded in popularity in the years after the Marshall Plan. The trade relations fostered by the Marshall Plan helped forge the North Atlantic alliance that would persist throughout the Cold War in the form of NATO. At the same time, the nonparticipation of the states of the Eastern Bloc was one of the first clear signs that the continent was now divided.\n\nThe Marshall Plan also played an important role in European integration. Both the Americans and many of the European leaders felt that European integration was necessary to secure the peace and prosperity of Europe, and thus used Marshall Plan guidelines to foster integration. In some ways, this effort failed, as the [[OEEC]] never grew to be more than an agent of economic cooperation. Rather, it was the separate [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which did not include Britain, that would eventually grow into the [[European Union]]. However, the OEEC served as both a testing and training ground for the structures that would later be used by the [[European Economic Community]]. The Marshall Plan, linked into the [[Bretton Woods system]], also mandated free trade throughout the region.\n\nWhile some historians today feel some of the praise for the Marshall Plan is exaggerated, it is still viewed favorably and many thus feel that a similar project would help other areas of the world. After the fall of communism, several proposed a \"Marshall Plan for Eastern Europe\" that would help revive that region. Others have proposed a Marshall Plan for Africa to help that continent, and US [[Al Gore|Vice President Al Gore]] suggested a [[Global Marshall Plan]].<ref>Marshall Plan style proposals for other parts of the world have been a perennial idea. For instance, [[Tony Blair]] and [[Gordon Brown]] have referred to their African aid goals as \"a Marshall Plan\". [https://www.theguardian.com/g8/story/0,13365,1498591,00.html Guardian.co.uk] After the end of the Cold War many felt Eastern Bloc needed a rebuilding plan.</ref> \"Marshall Plan\" has become a metaphor for any very large-scale government program that is designed to solve a specific social problem. It is usually used when calling for federal spending to correct a perceived failure of the private sector.\n\nNicholas Shaxson comments: \u201cIt is widely believed  that the plan worked by offsetting European countries\u2019 yawning deficits. But its real importance ... was simply to compensate for the US failure to institute controls on inflows of hot money from Europe. ... American post-war aid was less than the money flowing in the other direction.\u201c<ref>Nicholas Shaxson ''Treasure Islands - tax havens and the men who stole the world''.  Vintage press, 2012. chapter 4.</ref>  European hot money inflated the US dollar exchange rate, to the disadvantage of US exporters.\n\n==Repayment==\nThe Marshall Plan money was in the form of grants from the U.S. Treasury that did not have to be repaid.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} The [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development#Organisation for European Economic Co-operation|Organisation for European Economic Co-operation]] took the leading role in allocating funds, and the OEEC arranged for the transfer of the goods. The American supplier was paid in dollars, which were credited against the appropriate European Recovery Program funds. The European recipient, however, was not given the goods as a gift but had to pay for them (usually on credit) in local currency. These payments were kept by the European government involved in a special '''counterpart fund.''' This counterpart money, in turn, could be used by the government for further investment projects. Five percent of the counterpart money was paid to the US to cover the administrative costs of the ERP.<ref>Harry Bayard Price, ''The Marshall Plan and its Meaning'' (1955), p. 106</ref> In addition to ERP grants, the [[Export-Import Bank of the United States|Export-Import Bank]] (an agency of the US government) at the same time made long-term loans at low interest rates to finance major purchases in the US, all of which were repaid.\n\nIn the case of Germany, there also were 16 billion marks of debts from the 1920s which had defaulted in the 1930s, but which Germany decided to repay to restore its reputation. This money was owed to government and private banks in the US, France, and Britain. Another 16 billion marks represented postwar loans by the US. Under the [[Agreement on German External Debts|London Debts Agreement]] of 1953, the repayable amount was reduced by 50% to about 15 billion marks and stretched out over 30 years, and compared to the fast-growing German economy were of minor impact.<ref>Timothy W.

The only major Western European nation excluded was [[Francisco Franco|Francisco Franco's]] Spain, which was highly unpopular in Washington.  With the escalation of the Cold War, the United States reconsidered its position, and in 1951 embraced Spain as an ally, encouraged by Franco's aggressive [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] policies. Over the next decade, a considerable amount of American aid would go to Spain, but less than its neighbors had received under the Marshall Plan.<ref>Crafts, Toniolo, p.363</ref>\n\nThe Soviet Union had been as badly affected as any part of the world by the war. The Soviets imposed large [[War reparations|reparations]] payments on the Axis allies that were in its sphere of influence. [[Austria]], [[Finland]], [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], and especially [[East Germany]] were forced to pay vast sums and ship large amounts of supplies to the USSR. These reparation payments meant the Soviet Union itself received about the same as 16 European countries received in total from Marshall Plan aid.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=2db3MMq1W70C&pg=PA16&dq=%22soviet+union%22+%22marshall+plan%22+reparations&cd=19#v=onepage&q=%22soviet%20union%22%20%22marshall%20plan%22%20reparations&f=false|title=The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance: the thorny path from political to economic integration|page=16|publisher=M.E.

Under the terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union would in return ship raw materials such as food and timber to the western zones. In view of the Soviet failure to do so, the western zones halted the shipments east, ostensibly on a temporary basis, although they were never resumed. It was later shown that the main reason for halting shipments east was not the behavior of the USSR but rather the recalcitrant behavior of France.<ref>John Gimbel, \"The American Reparations Stop in Germany: An Essay on the Political Uses of History\"</ref> Examples of material received by the USSR were equipment from the [[Kugel-Fischer]] ballbearing plant at [[Schweinfurt]], the [[Daimler-Benz]] underground aircraft-engine plant at [[Obrigheim]], the [[Deschimag]] shipyards at [[Bremen-Weser]], and the [[Gendorf powerplant]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/docpage.cfm?docpage_id=3403 |title=GHDI&nbsp;\u2014 Document&nbsp;\u2014 Page |publisher=Germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org |accessdate=2010-03-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://images.library.wisc.edu/History/EFacs/GerRecon/omg1946n039/reference/history.omg1946n039.i0007.pdf |title=WISC.edu |accessdate=2011-12-09}}</ref>\n\nThe USSR did establish [[COMECON]] as a riposte to the Marshall Plan to deliver aid for Eastern Bloc countries, but this was complicated by the Soviet efforts to manage their own recovery from the war. The members of Comecon looked to the Soviet Union for oil; in turn, they provided machinery, equipment, agricultural goods, industrial goods, and consumer goods to the Soviet Union. Economic recovery in the East was much slower than in the West, resulting in the formation of the [[shortage economy|shortage economies]] and a gap in wealth between East and West.

Americans swapped their isolationist ideals for a much more global internationalist ideology after World War II.\n\n=== Polling data ===\nIn a [[NORC at the University of Chicago|National Opinion Research Center]] (NORC) poll taken in April 1945, a cross-section of Americans were asked, \"If our government keeps on sending lendlease materials, which we may not get paid for, to friendly countries for about three years after the war, do you think this will mean more jobs or fewer jobs for most Americans, or won't it make any difference?\" 75% said the same or more jobs; 10% said fewer.<ref>Hadley Cantril and Mildred Strunk, ''Public Opinion, 1935-1946'' (1947) p 414.</ref>\n\nBefore proposing anything to Congress in 1947, the Truman administration made an elaborate effort to organize public opinion in favor of the Marshall Plan spending, reaching out to numerous national organizations representing business, labor, farmers, women, and other interest groups.

[[Wilhelm R\u00f6pke]], who influenced [[Federal Minister of Economics and Technology (Germany)|German Minister for Economy]] [[Ludwig Erhard]] in his [[Wirtschaftswunder|economic recovery program]], believed recovery would be found in eliminating [[central planning]] and restoring a market economy in Europe, especially in those countries which had adopted more [[fascism|fascist]] and [[corporatism|corporatist]] economic policies. R\u00f6pke criticized the Marshall Plan for forestalling the transition to the free market by subsidizing the current, failing systems. Erhard put R\u00f6pke's theory into practice and would later credit R\u00f6pke's influence for West Germany's preeminent success.<ref>Erhard, p. 22; also, Zmirak</ref>\n\n[[Henry Hazlitt]] criticized the Marshall Plan in his 1947 book ''Will Dollars Save the World?'', arguing that economic recovery comes through savings, capital accumulation, and private enterprise, and not through large cash subsidies. [[Austrian School]] economist [[Ludwig von Mises]] criticized the Marshall Plan in 1951, believing that \"the American subsidies make it possible for [Europe's] governments to conceal partially the disastrous effects of the various socialist measures they have adopted\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mises.org/story/2321 |title=von Mises |publisher=Mises.org |accessdate=2009-08-18}}</ref> Some critics and Congressmen at the time believed that America was giving too much aid to Europe. America had already given Europe $9 billion in other forms of help in previous years. The Marshall Plan gave another $13 billion, equivalent to about $100 billion in 2010 value.<ref>New York: Palgrave, 2001. 1-3.</ref>\n\n===Modern criticism===\nHowever, its role in the rapid recovery has been debated. Most reject the idea that it alone miraculously revived Europe since the evidence shows that a general recovery was already underway. The Marshall Plan grants were provided at a rate that was not much higher in terms of flow than the previous [[UNRRA]] aid and represented less than 3% of the combined [[national income]] of the recipient countries between 1948 and 1951,<ref name=\"DeLong and Eichengreen 1993\" /> which would mean an increase in [[GDP]] growth of only 0.3%.<ref name=\"Nicholas Crafts 6\"/> In addition, there is no correlation between the amount of aid received and the speed of recovery: both [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] received more aid, but [[West Germany]] recovered significantly faster.<ref name=\"Nicholas Crafts 6\"/>\n\nCriticism of the Marshall Plan became prominent among historians of the [[Historical revisionism|revisionist]] school, such as [[Walter LaFeber]], during the 1960s and 1970s. They argued that the plan was American economic [[imperialism]] and that it was an attempt to gain control over Western Europe just as the Soviets controlled Eastern Europe economically through the [[Comecon]]. In a review of West Germany's economy from 1945 to 1951, German analyst [[Werner Abelshauser]] concluded that \"foreign aid was not crucial in starting the recovery or in keeping it going\". The economic recoveries of France, Italy, and Belgium, Cowen argues, began a few months before the flow of US money. Belgium, the country that relied earliest and most heavily on free-market economic policies after its liberation in 1944, experienced swift recovery and avoided the severe housing and food shortages seen in the rest of continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cato.org/research/articles/vasquez-030509.html |title=A Marshall Plan for Iraq? |publisher=Cato.org |date=May 9, 2003 |accessdate=2009-02-01 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122130923/https://www.cato.org/research/articles/vasquez-030509.html |archivedate=January 22, 2009 }}</ref>\n\nFormer US Chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank [[Alan Greenspan]] gives most credit to German Chancellor [[Ludwig Erhard]] for Europe's economic recovery. Greenspan writes in his memoir ''[[The Age of Turbulence]]'' that Erhard's economic policies were the most important aspect of postwar Western European recovery, even outweighing the contributions of the Marshall Plan. He states that it was Erhard's reductions in economic regulations that permitted Germany's miraculous recovery, and that these policies also contributed to the recoveries of many other European countries. Its recovery is attributed to traditional economic stimuli, such as increases in investment, fueled by a high savings rate and low taxes. Japan saw a large infusion of US investment during the [[Korean War]].<ref>{{Cite book|last=Forsberg|first=Aaron|title=America and the Japanese miracle: the Cold War context of Japan's postwar economic revival, 1950-1960|publisher=UNC Press|year=2000|page=84|isbn=978-0-8078-2528-0}}</ref>\n[[File:2003 Austria 20 Euro The Post-War Period back.jpg|thumb|right|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2003 coinage|The Postwar Period coin]]]]\n\n[[Noam Chomsky]] said the Marshall Plan \"set the stage for large amounts of private U.S. investment in Europe, establishing the basis for modern [[Multinational corporation|transnational corporations]]\".<ref>Chomsky, p. 9.</ref>\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[Alfred Friendly]], press aide to the US [[Secretary of Commerce]] [[W.
