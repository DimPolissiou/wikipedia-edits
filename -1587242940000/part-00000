Most of the foundations of the buildings are stone, but the upper floors are made from mud bricks, while palm leaves and wood are used for the ceilings.

This article settled a boundary dispute caused by ignorance of actual geography in the boundary agreed to in the 1783 [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] that ended the [[American Revolutionary War]].

Ratifications were exchanged on January 30, 1819.<ref name=\"US Treaties in Force 2005\" />  The Convention of 1818, along with the [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]] of 1817, marked the beginning of improved relations between the British Empire and its former colonies, and paved the way for more positive relations between the U.S. and Canada, notwithstanding that [[Defence Scheme No. 1|repelling U.S. invasion]] was a defense priority in Canada until 1928.<ref>Preston, Richard A. ''The Defence of the Undefended Border: Planning for War in North America 1867\u20131939'', McGill-Queen\u2019s University Press, 1977</ref>\n\nDespite the relatively friendly nature of the agreement, it nevertheless resulted in a fierce struggle for control of the Oregon Country in the following two decades. The British-chartered Hudson's Bay Company, having previously established a trading network centered on [[Fort Vancouver]] on the lower Columbia River, with other forts in what is now eastern Washington and Idaho as well as on the Oregon Coast and in Puget Sound, undertook a harsh campaign to restrict encroachment by U.S. fur traders to the area.  By the 1830s, with pressure in the U.S. mounting to annex the region outright, the company undertook a deliberate policy to exterminate all fur-bearing animals from the Oregon Country, in order to both maximize its remaining profit and to delay the arrival of U.S. mountain men and settlers. The policy of discouraging settlement was undercut to some degree by the actions of [[John McLoughlin]], Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver, who regularly provided relief and welcome to U.S. immigrants who had arrived at the post over the [[Oregon Trail]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\nBy the middle 1840s, the tide of U.S. immigration, as well as a U.S. political movement to claim the entire territory, led to a renegotiation of the agreement. The [[Oregon Treaty]] in 1846 permanently established the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] as the boundary between the United States and British North America to the Pacific Ocean.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819, between the U.S. and Spain, resolved borders from Florida to the Pacific Ocean.\n* The [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842 resolved uncertainties left by the 1818 treaty, including the Northwest Angle problem, which had been created by the use of a faulty map.\n* [[Oregon boundary dispute]], concerning the joint occupation of the Oregon Country by U.S. and British settlers.\n* [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which established most of the southern border between the US and Mexico after the defeat and occupation of Mexico in 1848, ending the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n* [[Gadsden Purchase|The Gadsden Purchase]], which completed the acquisition of the southwestern United States and completed the border between Mexico and the US in 1853 at the [[32nd parallel north|32nd parallel]] and the [[Rio Grande]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|Treaty of 1818}}\n* {{Cite Americana|wstitle=Fisheries Question |short=x}} This article traces British-United States negotiations regarding [[ocean fisheries]] from 1783 to 1910.\n\n{{USgrowth}}\n{{Oregon Pioneer History}}\n{{James Monroe}}\n{{John Quincy Adams}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Treaty Of 1818}}\n[[Category:1818 in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1818 in the United States]]\n[[Category:Canada\u2013United States border]]\n[[Category:Pre-statehood history of Oregon]]\n[[Category:Oregon Country]]\n[[Category:Legal history of Canada]]\n[[Category:Boundary treaties]]\n[[Category:Treaties involving territorial changes|1818]]\n[[Category:Pre-Confederation British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Pre-statehood history of Minnesota]]\n[[Category:1818 treaties]]\n[[Category:15th United States Congress]]\n[[Category:United States slavery law]]\n[[Category:United Kingdom\u2013United States treaties]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the United Kingdom (1801\u20131922)]]\n[[Category:October 1818 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox treaty\n| name                = Treaty of 1818\n| long_name           = Convention respecting fisheries, boundary, and the restoration of slaves\n| image               = File:UnitedStatesExpansion.png\n| image_width         = 180px\n| caption             = United States territorial border changes\n| type                = Bilateral treaty\n| context=Territorial cession\n| date_drafted        =\n| date_signed         = October 20, 1818\n| location_signed     = London, United Kingdom\n| date_sealed         =\n| date_effective      = January 30, 1819\n| condition_effective = \n| date_expiration     =\n| signatories         = {{flagcountry|United Kingdom}}<br />{{flagcountry|United States|1818}}\n| parties             =\n| depositor           = \n| languages           = English\n| website             =\n| wikisource          = Treaty of 1818\n}}\nThe '''Convention respecting fisheries, boundary and the restoration of slaves''' between the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]], also known as the '''London Convention''',  '''Anglo-American Convention of 1818''', '''Convention of 1818''', or simply the '''Treaty of 1818''', is an international [[treaty]] signed in 1818 between the above [[high contracting party|parties]].

Both could claim land and both were guaranteed free navigation throughout.\n*Article IV confirmed the Anglo-American Convention of 1815,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RSQyAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA2-PA30&lpg=RA2-PA30&dq=Anglo-American+Convention+of+1815&source=bl&ots=fnfuPrPldi&sig=m6vV9xHJaAnsXn_O2CbW_OoZXw8&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwik55zu6ZDKAhUY8GMKHerkDR0Q6AEIQzAH#v=onepage&q=Anglo-American%20Convention%20of%201815&f=false Article on \"The Convention of 1815\", The Marine Journal, June 3, 1922]</ref> which regulated commerce between the two parties, for an additional ten years.\n*Article V agreed to refer differences over a U.S. claim arising from the [[Treaty of Ghent]], which ended the [[War of 1812]], to \"some Friendly Sovereign or State to be named for that purpose.\" The U.S. claim was for return of, or compensation for, [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] that were in British territory or on British naval vessels when the treaty was signed.  The Treaty of Ghent article in question was about handing over property, and the U.S. claimed that these slaves were the property of U.S. citizens.<ref name=\"Canado-American Treaties Text\" />\n*Article VI established that ratification would occur within at most six months of signing the treaty.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove|section|date=October 2017}}<!--most of section has no references-->\n[[File:AlbertGallatin.jpeg|thumb|[[Albert Gallatin]] (1848 photograph)]]\nThe treaty was negotiated for the U.S. by [[Albert Gallatin]], ambassador to France, and [[Richard Rush]], minister to the UK; and for the UK by [[Frederick John Robinson, 1st Viscount Goderich|Frederick John Robinson]], Treasurer of the [[Royal Navy]] and member of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|privy council]], and [[Henry Goulburn]], an undersecretary of state.<ref name=\"Canado-American Treaties Summary\" /> The treaty was signed on October 20, 1818. Ratifications were exchanged on January 30, 1819.<ref name=\"US Treaties in Force 2005\" />  The Convention of 1818, along with the [[Rush\u2013Bagot Treaty]] of 1817, marked the beginning of improved relations between the British Empire and its former colonies, and paved the way for more positive relations between the U.S. and Canada, notwithstanding that [[Defence Scheme No. 1|repelling U.S. invasion]] was a defense priority in Canada until 1928.<ref>Preston, Richard A. ''The Defence of the Undefended Border: Planning for War in North America 1867\u20131939'', McGill-Queen\u2019s University Press, 1977</ref>\n\nDespite the relatively friendly nature of the agreement, it nevertheless resulted in a fierce struggle for control of the Oregon Country in the following two decades. The British-chartered Hudson's Bay Company, having previously established a trading network centered on [[Fort Vancouver]] on the lower Columbia River, with other forts in what is now eastern Washington and Idaho as well as on the Oregon Coast and in Puget Sound, undertook a harsh campaign to restrict encroachment by U.S. fur traders to the area.  By the 1830s, with pressure in the U.S. mounting to annex the region outright, the company undertook a deliberate policy to exterminate all fur-bearing animals from the Oregon Country, in order to both maximize its remaining profit and to delay the arrival of U.S. mountain men and settlers. The policy of discouraging settlement was undercut to some degree by the actions of [[John McLoughlin]], Chief Factor of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver, who regularly provided relief and welcome to U.S. immigrants who had arrived at the post over the [[Oregon Trail]].{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\nBy the middle 1840s, the tide of U.S. immigration, as well as a U.S. political movement to claim the entire territory, led to a renegotiation of the agreement. The [[Oregon Treaty]] in 1846 permanently established the [[49th parallel north|49th parallel]] as the boundary between the United States and British North America to the Pacific Ocean.{{Citation needed|date = October 2016}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Adams\u2013On\u00eds Treaty]] of 1819, between the U.S. and Spain, resolved borders from Florida to the Pacific Ocean.\n* The [[Webster\u2013Ashburton Treaty]] of 1842 resolved uncertainties left by the 1818 treaty, including the Northwest Angle problem, which had been created by the use of a faulty map.\n* [[Oregon boundary dispute]], concerning the joint occupation of the Oregon Country by U.S. and British settlers.\n* [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which established most of the southern border between the US and Mexico after the defeat and occupation of Mexico in 1848, ending the [[Mexican\u2013American War]].\n* [[Gadsden Purchase|The Gadsden Purchase]], which completed the acquisition of the southwestern United States and completed the border between Mexico and the US in 1853 at the [[32nd parallel north|32nd parallel]] and the [[Rio Grande]].\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikisource|Treaty of 1818}}\n* {{Cite Americana|wstitle=Fisheries Question |short=x}} This article traces British-United States negotiations regarding [[ocean fisheries]] from 1783 to 1910.\n\n{{USgrowth}}\n{{Oregon Pioneer History}}\n{{James Monroe}}\n{{John Quincy Adams}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Treaty Of 1818}}\n[[Category:1818 in the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:1818 in the United States]]\n[[Category:Canada\u2013United States border]]\n[[Category:Pre-statehood history of Oregon]]\n[[Category:Oregon Country]]\n[[Category:Legal history of Canada]]\n[[Category:Boundary treaties]]\n[[Category:Treaties involving territorial changes|1818]]\n[[Category:Pre-Confederation British Columbia]]\n[[Category:Pre-statehood history of Minnesota]]\n[[Category:1818 treaties]]\n[[Category:15th United States Congress]]\n[[Category:United States slavery law]]\n[[Category:United Kingdom\u2013United States treaties]]\n[[Category:Treaties of the United Kingdom (1801\u20131922)]]\n[[Category:October 1818 events]]\n", "name_user": "2605:6001:e5dc:e600:20b3:6b3:cd70:27ac", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treaty_of_1818"}

{"title_page": "Feminist performance art", "text_new": "{{essay-like|date=November 2017}}\nAccording to scholar Virginia Mackenny, [[performance art]] is a great tool to mold and remold gender because performance art, in most instances, includes a direct subversion to everyday conventions. MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement.

During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n=== Work ===\nOne of her early works is [[Cut Piece]], first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto. She kneeled on the stage in her best suit and invited audience members to use scissors to cut it off of her. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref>Munroe, Alexandra; Ono, Yoko; Hendricks, Jon; Altshuler, Bruce; Ross, David A.; Wenner, Jann S.; Concannon, Kevin C.; Tomii, Reiko; Sayle, Murray; Gomez, Edward M.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination. Over the nearly 60 years that she has been active, Ono has created installations of modern art across the globe, recorded numerous original songs both with John Lennon and the [[Plastic Ono Band]], as well as individually, and continues in activism to this day.\n\n== Orlan==\nORLAN (born as Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte) is French performance artist, most known for her radical use of plastic surgery to form her work. She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. On her exterior, she had a large photo of a torso on her chest. This was turned into a slot machine, where the audience could put a coin down the slot and watch it descend into the groin. As a reward, that audience member were given a kiss.

MacKenny also writes that feminist performance Art had a large presence \u201cin the late '60s and early '70s in America when, in the climate of protest constituted by the civil rights movement and [[second wave feminism]].\" There are several movements that fall under the category of feminist performance art, including Feminist Postmodernism, which took place during 1960-1970 and focused on the exploitation of women's bodies as a means for profit. Similarly, the Chicanx movement emerged in East Los Angeles during the 1970s, and focused on the Vietnam war, which was considered a post-apartheid movement.<ref name=\"MacKenny\">{{cite journal|last1=MacKenny|first1=Virginia|title=Post - Apartheid Performance Art as a Site of Gender Resistance|journal=Agenda Empowering Women for Gender Equity|date=2001|volume=49|pages=15\u201324|issn=1013-0950}}</ref>\n\n== Feminist Postmodernism ==\nAs Forte writes in her analysis of feminist performance art in the 1960s and 1970s, \u201cWithin this movement, women's performance emerges as a specific strategy that allies [[postmodernism]] and [[feminism]] \u2026 women used performance as a deconstructive strategy to demonstrate the objectification of women and its results\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Forte|first1=Jeanie|title=Women's Performance Art: Feminism and Postmodernism|journal=Theatre Journal|date=1988|volume=40.2|issn=0192-2882}}</ref> Another strategy that was commonly used by feminist performance artists during the postmodernist movement was \u201cremoving of the mask,\u201d which was utilized to demonstrate the consequences of female representations in the media, on the psyche of women. MacKenny also writes about the removing of the mask within Feminist Postmodernism. She writes, \u201cThis 'masquerade' or 'masking' occurs when women play with their assigned gender roles in multiple, often contradictory ways - adopting, adapting, overlaying and subverting the hegemonic discourse in the process.\u201d\n\n== Chicanx Movement ==\nDuring the late 1960s and early 1970s in East Los Angeles, protests broke out against the [[Vietnam War]] and its disproportionate death rate of 22% Chicanx people, while the percentage of the population that Chicanx people made up only 5% of the United States entire population.\n[[Asco (art collective)]], based in [[East Los Angeles, California|East LA]] commented on the impacts of the war on [[queer]] and brown identities, as well as the tragedies that occurred in the protests discussed above due to [[police brutality]]. The collective created visual and performative art. Some of their most famous performances experiment with gender roles, for example, one male identifying artist attended a club wearing \u201cbooty shorts, pink platforms, and a shirt that said \u2018just turned 21.\u2019\u201d<ref>{{cite book|last1=Perez|first1=Laura E.|title=Chicana art: the politics of spiritual and aesthetic altarities|date=2007|publisher=Durham: Duke U|isbn=978-0-8223-8988-0|doi=10.1215/9780822389880}}</ref>\nThe group continued to make performance and visual art that engaged with concepts related to queer and [[ethnic identity]] in East LA. During this period, East LA was ghettoized through a border of highways and dilapidated conditions.\n\n== Post Apartheid Movement ==\nMacKenny writes about two of the major players in the Post [[Apartheid]] performance art movement in [[South Africa]]. She first writes about Carol Anne Gainer and her performance entitled 'Exposed.' MacKenny explains that Gainer disrupts and subverts the binary as she performs as both the model and artist in this performance, which works to blur the \"distinction between artist/art, artist/model, constructor/constructed, finder/found, mind/body, subject/object.\"\nThe second artist which Mackenny writes about is a [[mixed race]] artist who performs a piece called 'Span.' MacKenny asserts that the artist Tracey Rose, alludes to Western societies exploitation of people of colour in scientific study and analysis, and the \"dissection and embalming of body parts of native 'others' (the most pertinent to the South African context being Saartje Baartman, a young Khoisan woman displayed for her unique genitalia and steatopygia, or enlarged buttocks),\" through her own display of her body.<ref name=\"MacKenny\"/> Her performance exposes her naked body and is contrasted against images of \"scientific\" exploitation, which both highlights the dichotomy between these subjects and engages with Mackenny's definition of post-apartheid performance art and its political aim to blur and disrupt binary structures.\n\n=== Anti War Performance Art Movement ===\nThe sociologist Rachel V Kutz-Flamenbaum writes about two major players in the anti-war performance art movement during the George W Bush administration. Code Pink, and Raging Grannies challenge and subvert gender norms in their performances, and thus, use very similar tactics and strategies. For instance, in Code Pink, Kutz-Flamenbaum asserts that, \"the emphasis on women\u2019s role as pacifist caregivers presents a nonthreatening image of women activists.\" \n\nThe perpetuated concept of women as non threatening, relies on the audiences association of pink as a non threatening and feminized colour. Kutz-Flamenbaum argues that \"Code Pink\u2019s use of civil disobedience and aggressive trailing of public officials confound and challenge normative gender expectations of women as passive, polite, and well-behaved.\"(95)<ref name=\"Kutz-Flamenbaum\">{{cite journal|last1=Kutz-Flamenbaum|first1=Rachel V|title=Code Pink, Raging Grannies, and the Missile Dick Chicks: Feminist Performance Activism in the Contemporary Anti-War Movement|journal=NWSA Journal|date=Spring 2001|volume=19|issue=1|pages=90\u201396|issn=1040-0656}}</ref>\nKutz-Flamenbaum claims that [[Raging Grannies]] similarly use this tactic in the description of their mission statement. Kutz-Flamenbaum explains that their mission statement \"illustrates the way Raging Grannies use norm- embracing stereotypes of 'little old ladies' and 'grannies' to challenge the gendered assumptions of their audiences.\" Their conscious performance as non-threatening and nurturing women, strategically and tactfully confront issues related to war and challenge the participation of the George W Bush administration in the war. \n\n== Performance Artists ==\n\n==[[Yoko Ono]]==\n\n=== Overview ===\nOno belonged to a generation of early feminist performance artists but is unique among them for her international fame as [[John Lennon]]\u2019s wife in the late 60s and 70s.  During their courtship the couple manipulated the press attention directed on them by documenting their relationship through performance art.<ref name=\":0\">Elizabeth Ann Lindau. \u201cMother Superior\u201d: Maternity and Creativity in the Work of Yoko Ono.\" ''Women and Music: A Journal of Gender and Culture'' 20 (University of Nebraska Press: 2016), 64.</ref> As Ono stated in a 1986 TV interview, \u201cwe were always together\u2026 we exchanged very fully between ourselves.\u201d<ref name=\":1\">''Yoko Ono on John Lennon's Assasination, Their Son Sean and Influencing The Beatles Breakup.'', ''YouTube'' (YouTube, 2017), <nowiki>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Suj8MCysBKQ</nowiki>)</ref> They emphasized this unusual situation, where the husband and wife worked together rather than the pair working separately outside the home, through their performance art \u201cBed-ins.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAs an interracial couple they also challenged racial stereotypes. She confessed, \u201cI think it was a big lesson for the world that we were together\u2026 And I think it might have helped too for people to understand what it means to confront the interracial couple.\u201d<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nParenthood is a factor in the controversy surrounding Ono. Women were not usually part of performance art or rock music, and mothers in particular were antithetical to everything rock stood for. The public idea of rock music as youthful male rebellion placed mothers as the opponent. When Ono and Lennon began their relationship, Beatles fans saw this female influence as an intrusion and the force that broke up their favorite band. However, as Ono saw it, the [[The Beatles|Beatles]] grew apart naturally and she was not the primary cause.<ref name=\":1\" /> Public confusion was exacerbated with Ono\u2019s pregnancy. While pregnant with their son Sean, Ono announced to Lennon: \u201cI am carrying the baby nine months and that is enough. You take care of it afterwards.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> After Sean\u2019s birth, she ran the couple\u2019s business while Lennon stayed home as \u201chousehusband.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> Ono\u2019s hands off approach to parenting is a source of controversy because she was simultaneously too motherly and not motherly enough.\n\n=== Work ===\nOne of her early works is [[Cut Piece]], first performed in 1964 at the Yamaichi Concert Hall in Kyoto. She kneeled on the stage in her best suit and invited audience members to use scissors to cut it off of her. Confronting issues of gender, class and cultural identity, Ono sat silently until the piece concluded at her discretion.<ref>Munroe, Alexandra; Ono, Yoko; Hendricks, Jon; Altshuler, Bruce; Ross, David A.; Wenner, Jann S.; Concannon, Kevin C.; Tomii, Reiko; Sayle, Murray; Gomez, Edward M.

The book reads like an instruction manual for the reader to create their own versions of her pieces either physically or in the imagination. Over the nearly 60 years that she has been active, Ono has created installations of modern art across the globe, recorded numerous original songs both with John Lennon and the [[Plastic Ono Band]], as well as individually, and continues in activism to this day.\n\n== Orlan==\nORLAN (born as Mireille Suzanne Francette Porte) is French performance artist, most known for her radical use of plastic surgery to form her work. She uses her face and body as a malleable tool to change her appearance and therefore change her art. She primarily used plastic surgery to morph and change her body in her theatrical expression. Orlan uses her body at the heart of her expression, to articulate her political, social and cultural beliefs. Due to suffering an ectopic pregnancy, she felt her body was changed dramatically, and through that, she chose to turn her body into artwork through the use of plastic surgery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/orlan/|title=ORLAN {{!}} artnet|website=www.artnet.com|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref>\n\nOne of her most notable performances was that of the 1977 International Contemporary Art Fair in Paris. On her exterior, she had a large photo of a torso on her chest. This was turned into a slot machine, where the audience could put a coin down the slot and watch it descend into the groin. As a reward, that audience member were given a kiss. She also displayed her sexual organs during menstruation under a magnifying glass for respective audience members to study. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Donger|first=Simon|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=XoXFBQAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover&dq=orlan&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjyw_Da7snoAhVxlFwKHZmmAdsQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&q=orlan&f=false|title=ORLAN: A Hybrid Body of Artworks|last2=Shepherd|first2=Simon|date=2010-05-20|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-97128-0|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== Bj\u00f6rk Gu\u00f0mundsd\u00f3ttir ==\nThe musical artist Bj\u00f6rk has been challenging musical barriers since her time in the band [[The Sugarcubes]], which became the biggest alternative rock band in Iceland.

The album was developed into an iPad and iPod app that allowed users to listen to each song while playing games that visually showcased the music. The most notable example is the song \u2018Thunderbolt\u2019  which allows listeners to draw \"Tesla coil charges which alter the bass lines you hear\" and when she performs the song live she has twin Tesla coils to play the bass line.<ref name=\":2\" /> This album however was more than a challenge for Bj\u00f6rk to create a new sound, she created the album as a response to the environmental issues Iceland was facing in 2008. Iceland had allowed the aluminum smelters to take over the countries fishing industry while being the cause for excessive greenhouse gas emissions.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people.

Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of: [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]], [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

In a 2012 interview with [[Westword]], he says that his brother took him to the [[Bob Johnson (ice hockey, born 1931)|Bob Johnson]] ice hockey school to play.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\n===Interest in music===\n\nHis interest in music initially stemmed from boredom as he was recovering from an ice hockey injury. He also had some familial ties: his father and grandfather owned and played banjos, and his father also made a [[dulcimer]] for his mother as a gift, although she did not play it.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nWhile recuperating from said injury, Munly taught himself how to play his father's 19th century-era [[banjo]], which was technically off-limits to handle,<ref name=\"Munly on Vera\" /> although his mother knew what was going on.

It is a role that he is happy to take on by himself, believing that a band's success is dependent on playing to individual strengths rather than collaboration with members on each part of an album's creation.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" /> He also says that he is \"selfish\" with his written material and serious about lyrical preservation.<ref name=\"Munly Acting Westword\" />\n\nHe expanded on his way of songwriting in a 2019 interview with Sadwave, a Russian publication:\n\n{{quote|''\"From the very beginning, I understand where and why I'm writing a song. There is no complicated science. When you have been doing this for so many years, you bring the skill to automatism. I can start with a melody, but I can with a text \u2013 I always have a lot of words, I write a lot. I constantly find common themes in my songs, but I never had the feeling that I was working on a pattern. It would be immoral and unnatural, and I would not want to. I have characters who constantly come back, wander from song to song. But I try to change the angle, write on behalf of different people. On behalf of all sad people.\"''<ref name=\"Munly Sadwave\">{{cite news |last1=Kurkin |first1=Dmitry |title=Jay Manley [sic] (DBUK): 'I try to write on behalf of all sad people' |url=https://sadwave.com/2019/02/jay-munli/ |accessdate=April 5, 2020 |work=sad wave |date=February 8, 2019 |ref=Munly Sadwave}}</ref>}}\n\n===Musical themes and genres===\n\nHis music has ties to [[alt-country]] and [[Gothabilly|Gothic-Americana]]. Common themes include religion, violence and dysfunctional relationships; often they are intertwined. His increasingly narrative songs often feature banjo and, since the recording of his fourth album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', strings.\n\nOne topic that Munly deliberately does not write about is politics, since he \"hates\" music that veers into that kind of territory.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he admits that the stories and songs that he writes can be applied to real-world events in a way that coincidentally fits.<ref name=\"DBUK Marquee\" />\n\nHis written works have been compared to that of: [[Edward Gorey]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Charles Portis]], [[Flannery O'Connor]],<ref name=\"SC NARC\">{{cite news |last1=Fisher |first1=Lee |title=Interview: Slim Cessna's Auto Club |url=https://narcmagazine.com/slim-cessnas-auto-club/ |accessdate=18 April 2020 |work=NARC. |publisher=NARC Magazine |date=October 10, 2016 |ref=SC NARC}}</ref> [[Cormac McCarthy]], and [[Nick Cave]].\n\n===Vocals===\n\nTechnically, Munly is a baritone, but his [[vocal range]] extends from A1 to F5.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 1\">{{cite news |title=Jay \"Munly\" Munly |url=https://therangeplanet.proboards.com/thread/14/jay-munly |accessdate=9 April 2020 |work=The Range Planet |date=September 22, 2019 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 1}}</ref> Audio samples can be found on Youtube.<ref name=\"Munly Vocal Range 2\">{{cite web |title=The Vocal Range of Jay Munly |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X_hVoW0VwVA |via=YouTube |accessdate=April 9, 2020 |ref=Munly Vocal Range 2}}</ref> \n\nEarly on in his solo career, he sang at a higher register than what he usually sounds like on his later records. \n\nOn the expanded DVDs of ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004) and ''The Commandments According to SCAC'' (2016), Munly read the lyrics of each song as poetry, employing a wide range of voices to the characters in his songs.\n\n===Controversial lyrics===\n\nAs stated in a few interviews, people have found some of Munly's material controversial and politically incorrect. It is important to note that in most cases, the words and phrases used (as well as the views they represent) are that of the fictional characters that Munly creates, not of Munly himself.\n\nExamples:\n\n* ''\"Boys with tattoos can't be Jews\"'' \u2013 from \"Kidneys Running Dry\" on ''Blurry'' (1996)<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /><ref name=\"KRD Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Munly \u2013 Kidneys Running Dry |url=https://genius.com/Munly-kidneys-running-dry-lyrics?__cf_chl_jschl_tk__=bd3ae05fe6c1e2a47c4f0713ffa5a16e71fce6fd-1586308658-0-AacccNM6Up3QUKAwcxWr7moI6buvh28pOpYPxYODrvwTY_F1arxPxbTRgSuWyl4Xdp0ySY_ZseZwWCStv8dumtz5AhmL5llOOnD9_3dv6-XTquwykYgduqCixdMk01PstYrSa8KQZi4SK3emYdNuLlbX4RFCHJbwQ1YRExOJjd6dkKD1_GHgcdfYYDe-vTJWI1uyX_0R8Q64ZevT3n-7A-7f2-ifsSZoF6J2JCq_RT2aMwKoWBxbHjarJrGdvNiZWwohYzH2ba2tN14wf2PwTXEzsdbFCgp-hDaOKuoeEYASB7ZBgYOJT_5LMn8GQ2PkKSfxVXNgggJO-I6ajZK3bMX27bSVAiYaqRheMbR_klyaHJvQPTQvRxAPyOR5CZ1c9A |website=Genius |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=KRD Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[a] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"My Darling Sambo\" \u2013 the first track title on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"JCS Amazon\">{{cite web |title=MUNLY, JAY \u2013 Jimmy Carter Syndrome |url=https://www.amazon.com/Jimmy-Carter-Syndrome-JAY-MUNLY/dp/B000BKWZOI |website=Amazon Music |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=JCS Amazon}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[b] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Paint your blackface/Yeah, won't you put me in your anteroom case/I'll be your n***er/On stage\"'' \u2013 from \"Censer from the Footlights\" on ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'' (2002)<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" /><ref name=\"CFTF Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Jay Munly \u2013 Censer from the Footlights Lyrics |url=http://www.songlyrics.com/jay-munly/censer-from-the-footlights-lyrics/ |website=SongLyrics |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=CFTF Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[c] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[d] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[e] ]]</sup> <sup>[[#Notes|[f] ]]</sup>\n\n* ''\"Then we found ourselves a half-breed/To tell us our fortune today/He painted my hands a deep, dark red/Said 'now boy, you know that you gotta pay'\"'' \u2013 from \"Goose Walking Over My Grave\" on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"Munly Birds\">{{cite news |last1=Bradley |first1=Lisa M. |title=A Crack in Its Speak: Fantastic Birds in the Gothic Country Lyrics of Jay Munly |url=http://stonetelling.com/issue8-aug2012/bradley-speak.html |accessdate=April 6, 2020 |work=Stone Telling |issue=Issue No. 8 |date=August 2012 |ref=Munly Birds}}</ref><ref name=\"Goose Lyrics\">{{cite web |title=Lyrics \u2013 Goose Walking Over My Grave |url=https://www.musixmatch.com/lyrics/Munly-The-Lee-Lewis-Harlots/Goose-Walking-Over-My-Grave |website=Musixmatch |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=Goose Lyrics}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[g] ]]</sup>\n\n* \"Cassius Castrato The She-Male of the Men's Prison\" \u2013 the fifth track title on ''Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots'' (2004)<ref name=\"LLH Album\">{{cite web |title=Munly & The Lee Lewis Harlots |url=https://slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com/collections/munly/products/munly-the-lee-lewis-harlots |website=slimcessnasautoclub.myshopify.com |accessdate=April 7, 2020 |ref=LLH Album}}</ref> <sup>[[#Notes|[h] ]]</sup>\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Solo career===\n\nIn the 1990s, Munly started out his music career as a solo artist.

He also shared a 7-inch vinyl album with [[Roger Manning]].<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" />\n\nHe released his debut solo album, ''Blurry'', in 1996 through Top Notch, an imprint of [[What Are Records?]]. ''Munly de Dar He'' and ''Galvanized Yankee'' were also released through Top Notch in 1997 and 1999, respectively. His fourth and final solo album, ''Jimmy Carter Syndrome'', was released through [[Alternative Tentacles]] in 2002. Each of these albums were re-mastered by Bob Ferbrache and re-released as limited editions through Smooch Records in 2006. Only 1,000 copies of each were printed.\n\nHe has worked with several musicians that are featured on his albums, such as John Ellison of The Reejers and Chris Mars of The Replacements.<ref name=\"A Munly Man\" /> However, he makes a point of not listing the exact musical contributions of each member in liner notes, preferring the simplicity of the 'Modern Library book' aesthetic.<ref name=\"Munly Splendid\" />\n\nAlthough Munly is the primary vocalist and lyricist on each of his albums, he hesitates to call himself a \"singer-songwriter\":\n\n''{{quote|\"It's kind of rough being a solo artist.

Two years later, he resigned and emigrated from France to Great Britain, presumably to escape from the French Revolution, being a monarchist like his father. For four years, he served in the [[Army of Cond\u00e9]] against the French Republic.\n\nIn 1795, he returned to France to help organize a royalist insurrection in [[Berry, France|Berry]]. However, Ph\u00e9lippeaux was arrested by general [[Simon Canuel]], and the plan failed. He was imprisoned in [[Bourges]] but escaped on the eve of his execution with the help of a relative. Unscathed, he secretly resumed counter-revolutionary activities outside of Paris.<ref name=Shmuelevitz/>\n\nTwo years later, in 1797, Antoine de Ph\u00e9lippeaux returned to Paris in order to free an English naval officer named [[Sidney Smith (Royal Navy officer)|Sir William Sidney Smith]] from [[Temple (Paris)|Temple]] prison. At the same time, he planned to rescue three royalists and two people that had aided in his escape. The elaborate plan included the construction of a tunnel from a nearby house to the prison, and involved the help of a mason to chip away at bricks and a seven-year-old girl to serve as a decoy. Nevertheless, the plot failed and Ph\u00e9lippeaux had to reorganize.\n\nThis time, in order to communicate with the prisoners, he made love to the jailer's daughter. Ph\u00e9lippeaux procured false papers and presented himself at Temple prison as a police commissioner. After presenting a forged order, Smith and the others were released and left quickly by carriage. Notwithstanding, the carriage turned a sharp corner, injuring a child and causing a crowd to gather around the overturned carriage. Despite that, Ph\u00e9lippeaux forced himself and the escapees through the crowd.

Ph\u00e9lippeaux chartered a small fishing boat, and once they were in the [[English Channel|British Channel]], the group boarded a British ship.\n\nOn May 7, 1798, they landed in [[Portsmouth]] and arrived in London by the next morning.

In 1799, Ph\u00e9lippeaux accompanied Smith on his diplomatic mission to [[Constantinople]]; this led to Acre, where Ph\u00e9lippeaux was presented to [[Jezzar Pasha|Jezzar Pa\u015fa]].

Acre also had very few cannons facing the sea. He convinced Jezzar of the dangers, and gangs of laborers were placed in Ph\u00e9lippeaux's hands. He began to strengthen the walls, mount guns, construct trenches, and excavate the moat. The trenches he constructed were behind the old fortifications, creating a double barrier.
