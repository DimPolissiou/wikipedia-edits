Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district\u2013what was then the 10th District\u2013for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7\u20132 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ah1suoNgrH7g |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Environmental movement====\nThe distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),<ref>{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}</ref> and eventually the current ongoing debate about \"sense of place\" and preserving the Austin quality of life.

Before then, Austin had been entirely or almost entirely within the borders of a single congressional district\u2013what was then the 10th District\u2013for over a century. Opponents characterized the resulting district layout as excessively partisan [[gerrymandering]], and the plan was challenged in court by Democratic and minority activists; of note, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] has never struck down a redistricting plan for being excessively partisan. The plan was subsequently upheld by a three-judge federal panel in late 2003, and on June 28, 2006, the matter was largely settled when the Supreme Court, in a 7\u20132 decision, upheld the entire congressional redistricting plan with the exception of a Hispanic-majority district in southwest Texas. This affected Austin's districting, as U.S. Rep. [[Lloyd Doggett]]'s district (U.S. Congressional District 25) was found to be insufficiently compact to compensate for the reduced [[minority influence]] in the southwest district; it was redrawn so that it took in most of southeastern Travis County and several counties to its south and east.<ref>{{Cite news|first=Greg |last=Stohr |title=Republican Texas Redistricting Upheld by Top Court |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=ah1suoNgrH7g |publisher=Bloomberg  |date=June 28, 2006 |accessdate=July 24, 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Environmental movement====\nThe distinguishing political movement of Austin politics has been that of the environmental movement, which spawned the parallel neighborhood movement, then the more recent conservationist movement (as typified by the Hill Country Conservancy),<ref>{{Cite news|title=Conservancy shifts into high gear; Efforts steer land away from development |first=Sara |last=Zaragosa |newspaper=Austin Business Journal |date=August 28, 2009 |url=http://austin.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2009/08/31/story4.html }}</ref> and eventually the current ongoing debate about \"sense of place\" and preserving the Austin quality of life.

Highway 130 runs concurrently with Highway 45 from [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] on the north until it reaches [[US Highway 183|US 183]] well south of Austin, where it splits off and goes west. The entire route of State Highway 130 is now complete with last leg, which opened on November 1, 2012. The highway is noted for having the entire route with a speed limit of at least {{convert|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The 41-mile section of the toll road between Mustang Ridge and Seguin has a posted speed limit of {{convert|85|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, the highest posted [[speed limits in the United States|speed limit in the United States]].\n\n[[State Highway 45 (Texas)|State Highway 45]] runs east\u2013west from just south of Highway 183 in [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]] to 130 inside [[Pflugerville, Texas|Pflugerville]] (just east of Round Rock). A tolled extension of State Highway Loop 1 was also created. A new southeast leg of Highway 45 has recently been completed, running from US 183 and the south end of Segment 5 of TX-130 south of Austin due west to I-35 at the [[FM 1327]]/Creedmoor exit between the south end of Austin and [[Buda, Texas|Buda]]. The 183A Toll Road opened March 2007, providing a tolled alternative to U.S. 183 through the cities of [[Leander, Texas|Leander]] and [[Cedar Park, Texas|Cedar Park]]. Currently under construction is a change to East US 290 from US 183 to the town of Manor. Officially, the tollway will be dubbed Tollway 290 with the Manor Expressway as a nickname.\nDespite the overwhelming initial opposition to the toll road concept when it was first announced, all three toll roads have exceeded revenue projections.<ref name=\"Toll Road Revenue\">{{Cite news| first = Ben | last = Wear | title = Positive signs for financial future of Texas 130; | date = September 28, 2009 | url = http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AASB&p_theme=aasb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&s_hidethis=no&p_field_label-0=Author&p_text_label-0=Ben%20Wear&p_field_label-1=title&p_bool_label-1=AND&s_dispstring=Toll%20revenue%20exceed%20AND%20byline(Ben%20Wear)%20AND%20date(09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&p_field_date-0=YMD_date&p_params_date-0=date:B,E&p_text_date-0=09/01/2009%20to%2001/01/2010)&p_field_advanced-0=&p_text_advanced-0=(Toll%20revenue%20exceed)&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&xcal_useweights=no | work = Austin American-Statesman | pages = B\u20131 | accessdate = August 7, 2010 | quote = Report on the tollway...has been making more money than projected.}}</ref>\n\n===Airports===\n[[File:AUSCentralConcourse.JPG|thumb|The Barbara Jordan Terminal at [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]]]]\nAustin's airport is [[Austin\u2013Bergstrom International Airport]] (ABIA) ([[List of airports by IATA code: A#AU|IATA code]] '''AUS'''), located {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} southeast of the city.

Initially supported by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Spain]], the French intervention in Mexico was a consequence of Mexican President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]]'s imposition of a two-year moratorium of loan-interest payments from July 1861 to French, British, and Spanish creditors.<ref name=\"Chartrand\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nTo extend the influence of Imperial France, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] instigated the intervention in Mexico by claiming that the military adventure was a foreign policy commitment to [[free trade]]. The establishment of a friendly monarchy in Mexico would ensure European access to Latin American markets; and French access to Mexican silver. To realize his imperial ambitions without interference from other European nations, Napoleon III entered into a coalition with the United Kingdom and Spain, while the United States was occupied with [[American Civil War|its civil war]] and unable to enforce the [[Monroe Doctrine]].<ref name=\"Chartrand\"/>{{rp|3}}\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine was an American policy, written by James Monroe and issued in December 1823, that warned against further European imperialism in the Americas. The doctrine reads \"the American continents, by the free and independent condition which they have assumed and maintain, are henceforth not to be considered as subjects for future colonization by any European powers.\" <ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&doc=23&page=transcript |title=The Monroe Doctrine |last=Monroe |first=James |website=OurDocuments.gov |access-date=25 February 2020}}</ref> Britain would eventually show support for the Union because of their shared quality of abolition. So the Union's stance would have no real political significance to either Britain or Spain. Like England, France had already abolished slavery, but they wanted to keep Maximilian in Mexico. The French government knew that a unified America would once again enforce the Monroe Doctrine, so the Confederacy was tempting as a buffer nation to protect their Latin reign. While technically, the French government never recognized the Confederacy, that does not mean that the nation as a whole ignored the American Civil War. French Capitalists funneled funds to the Confederacy to help assist war efforts.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://study.com/academy/lesson/britain-and-france-respond-to-the-american-civil-war.html |title=Britain and France Respond to the American Civil War - Video & Lesson Transcript |website=Study.com |language=en |access-date=2020-03-03}}</ref>\n\nOn 31 October 1861, France, the United Kingdom, and Spain agreed to the [[Convention of London (1861)|Convention of London]], a joint effort to extract repayments from Mexico. On 8 December, the Spanish fleet disembarked troops at the port of [[Veracruz]], on the Gulf of Mexico. When the British and the Spanish discovered that France had unilaterally planned to seize Mexico, they withdrew from the military coalition agreed in London. The subsequent French invasion created the [[Second Mexican Empire]] (1861\u20131867), a [[client state]] of the French Empire. Besides the Continental empires involved, the [[Russian Empire]] also acknowledged the [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] of Maximilian's Second Mexican Empire, when the Tsarist fleet saluted the imperial Mexican flag when sailing off the Pacific Ocean coastal state of [[Guerrero]].<ref name=\"DailyAlta2\">{{Cite journal |date=16 September 1864 |title=Mexico and the West Indies |url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cdnc/cgi-bin/imageserver/imageserver.pl?oid=DAC18640916.1.1&key=&getpdf=true |format=pdf |journal=Daily Alta California |location=San Francisco, United States |publisher=[[Robert B.

They were forced to make a defence in a nearby [[hacienda]]. Danjou was mortally wounded at the hacienda, and his men mounted an almost suicidal bayonet attack, fighting to nearly the last man; only three French Legionnaires survived.

Puebla surrendered to the French shortly afterward, on 17 May. On 31 May, President Ju\u00e1rez fled the city with his cabinet, retreating northward to [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez|Paso del Norte]] and later to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]]. Having taken the treasure of the state with them, the government-in-exile remained in Chihuahua until 1867.\n\nFrench troops under Bazaine entered [[Mexico City]] on 7 June 1863. The main army entered the city three days later led by General Forey. General Almonte was appointed the provisional President of Mexico on 16 June, by the Superior Junta (which had been appointed by Forey). The Superior Junta with its 35 members met on 21 June and proclaimed a Catholic Empire on 10 July. The crown was offered to Maximilian, following pressures by Napoleon. Maximilian accepted the crown on 3 October, at the hands of the Comisi\u00f3n Mexicana, sent by the Superior Junta.\n\n==Arrival of Maximilian==\n[[File:Maximilian emperor of Mexico.jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian I]] of Mexico]]\n\nOn 28 and 31 March 1864, men from the French [[man-of-war]] ''[[French ship Cordeli\u00e8re|Cordeli\u00e8re]]'' tried [[Capture of Mazatl\u00e1n|to take Mazatl\u00e1n]], but were initially repelled by Mexicans commanded by Colonel [[Gaspar S\u00e1nchez Ochoa]].\n\nThe French under Bazaine occupied [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] on 6 January 1864, and troops under Douay occupied [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] on 6 February. Further decisive French victories continued with the [[Battle of Acapulco|fall of Acapulco]] on 3 June, occupation of [[Durango, Durango|Durango]] on 3 July, and the defeat of republicans in the states of [[Sinaloa]] and [[Jalisco]] in November.\n\nMaximilian formally accepted the crown on 10 April, signing the [[s:Treaty of Miramar|Treaty of Miramar]], and landed at Veracruz on 28 May (or possibly 29 May) 1864 in the [[SMS Novara (1850)|SMS ''Novara'']]. He was enthroned as Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico, with his wife [[Charlotte of Belgium]], known by the Spanish form of her name, Carlota. In reality, Maximilian was a puppet monarch of the [[Second French Empire]].\n\nMaximilian expressed progressive European political ideas, favouring the establishment of a limited monarchy sharing powers with a democratically elected congress. He inspired passage of laws to abolish child labour, limit working hours, and abolish a system of land tenancy that virtually amounted to serfdom among the Indians. This was too liberal to please Mexico's conservatives, and the nation's liberals refused to accept a monarch, leaving Maximilian with few enthusiastic allies within Mexico.\n\nOn Sunday, 13 November 1864, three [[France|French]] [[men-of-war]] (''[[French ship Victoire|Victoire]]'', ''[[French ship D'Assas|D'Assas]]'' and ''[[French ship Diamante|Diamante]]'') shelled [[Mazatl\u00e1n]] 13 times, and Imperial Mexican forces under [[Manuel Lozada]] entered and [[Capture of Mazatl\u00e1n|captured the city]].\n\n\n==Early Republican victories==\n[[File:Benito Pablo Ju\u00e1rez Garc\u00eda.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], Republican leader and President]]\nThe French continued with victories in 1865, with Bazaine capturing [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] on 9 February (defeating the city's defenders under General [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]). The French fleet landed soldiers who captured [[Guaymas]] on 29 March.\n\nBut on 11 April, republicans defeated Imperial forces at [[Battle of Tac\u00e1mbaro|Tac\u00e1mbaro]] in [[Michoac\u00e1n]]. In April and May the republicans had many forces in the states of [[Sinaloa]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. Most towns along the [[Rio Grande]] were also occupied by republicans.\n\nThe decree known as the \"[[Black Decree]]\" was issued by Maximilian on 3 October, which threatened any Mexican captured in the war with immediate execution. This was later the basis for the next government to order his own execution. Several high-ranking republican officials were executed under this order on 21 October.\n\n==U.S. diplomacy and involvement==\nAs early as 1859, U.S. and Mexican efforts to ratify the [[McLane-Ocampo Treaty]] had failed in the bitterly divided [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], where tensions were high between the North and the South over other issues. Such a treaty would have allowed U.S. construction in Mexico and protection from European forces in exchange for a payment of $4 million to the heavily indebted government of Benito Ju\u00e1rez. On 3 December 1860, President [[James Buchanan]] had delivered a speech stating his displeasure at being unable to secure Mexico from European interference: \n\t\n<blockquote>European governments would have been deprived of all pretext to interfere in the territorial and domestic concerns of Mexico. We should have thus been relieved from the obligation of resisting, even by force, should this become necessary, any attempt of these governments to deprive our neighboring Republic of portions of her territory, a duty from which we could not shrink without abandoning the traditional and established policy of the American people.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Manning|first=William R. |author2=James Morton Callahan |author3=John H.

President [[Abraham Lincoln]] expressed his sympathy to Latin American republics against any European attempt to establish a monarchy. Shortly after the establishment of the Imperial government  in April 1864, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]], while maintaining U.S. neutrality, expressed U.S. discomfort at the imposition of a monarchy in Mexico: \"Nor can the United States deny that their own safety and destiny to which they aspire are intimately dependent on the continuance of free republican institutions throughout America.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Manning|first=William R. |author2=James Morton Callahan |author3=John H.

The combined Austro-Belgian Volunteer Corps was formally disbanded at the end of 1866. Approximately 1,000 of these Austrian and Belgian volunteers chose to enlist in Maximilian's Imperial Army while the remaining 3,428 embarked for Europe.<ref>Rene Chartrand, page 36 \"The Mexican Adventure 1861-67\", {{ISBN|1-85532-430-X}}</ref> The separate [[Belgian Legion]] was also dissolved in December 1866 and 754 returned to their homeland.<ref>Rene Chartrand, page 37 \"The Mexican Adventure 1861-67\", {{ISBN|1-85532-430-X}}</ref>\n\nOn 13 November, [[Ram\u00f3n Corona]] and the French agreed to terms for the withdrawal of the latter forces from [[Mazatl\u00e1n]].

Gen. [[Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00eda]], left, Maximiian, center, Gen. [[Miguel Miram\u00f3n]], right It is one of 5 versions of his renderings of the event.]]\n\nThe Republicans occupied the rest of the states of Zacatecas, San Luis Potos\u00ed and Guanajuato in January. The French evacuated the capital on 5 February.\n\nOn 13 February 1867, Maximilian withdrew to [[Santiago de Quer\u00e9taro|Quer\u00e9taro]]. The Republicans began a siege of the city on 9 March, and Mexico City on 12 April. An imperial sortie from Quer\u00e9taro failed on 27 April.\n\nOn 11 May, Maximilian resolved to try to escape through the enemy lines. He was intercepted on 15 May. Following a court-martial, he was sentenced to death. Many of the crowned heads of Europe and other prominent figures (including liberals [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]) sent telegrams and letters to Mexico pleading for Maximilian's life to be spared, but Ju\u00e1rez refused to commute the sentence. He believed he had to send a strong message that Mexico would not tolerate any government imposed by foreign powers.\n\nMaximilian was executed on 19 June (along with his generals [[Miguel Miram\u00f3n]] and [[Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00eda]]) on the [[Cerro de las Campanas]], a hill on the outskirts of Quer\u00e9taro, by the forces loyal to President Benito Ju\u00e1rez, who had kept the federal government functioning during the French intervention. Mexico City surrendered the day after Maximilian was executed.\n\nThe republic was restored, and President Ju\u00e1rez was returned to power in the national capital. He made few changes in policy, given that the progressive Maximilian had upheld most of Ju\u00e1rez's liberal reforms.\n\nAfter the victory, the Conservative party was so thoroughly discredited by its alliance with the invading French troops that it effectively became defunct. The Liberal party was almost unchallenged as a political force during the first years of the \"restored republic\". In 1871, however, Ju\u00e1rez was re-elected to yet another term as president in spite of a constitutional prohibition of re-elections.\n\n[[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] (a Liberal general and a hero of the French war, but increasingly conservative in outlook), one of the losing candidates, launched a rebellion against the president. Supported by conservative factions within the Liberal party, the attempted revolt (the so-called [[Plan de la Noria]]) was already at the point of defeat when Ju\u00e1rez died in office on 19 July 1872, making it a moot point. D\u00edaz ran against interim president [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada]], lost the election, and retired to his [[hacienda]] in [[Oaxaca]]. Four years later, in 1876, when Lerdo ran for re-election, D\u00edaz launched a second, successful revolt (the [[Plan de Tuxtepec]]) and captured the presidency. He held it through eight terms until 1911, a period when he jailed many political opponents at the fort off Veracruz.\n\n==Divisions and disembarkation of allied troops==\n\n===French expeditionary force, 31 December 1862===\n[[File:L\u00e9gionnaire-Mexique.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Campaign uniform of a French Foreign legionary during the Mexican campaign]]\nAt its peak in 1863, the French expeditionary force counted 38,493 men<ref name=\"Niox\"/> {{rp|740}} (which represented 16.25% of the [[French army]]).<ref name=\"Raymond\">{{cite journal\n  |journal = [[The New York Times]]\n  |author = \n  |authorlink = \n  | editor-last = Raymond\n  | editor-first = Henry Jarvis\n  |title = The military force of France.; The Actual Organization of the Army Its Strength and Effectiveness.

Initially supported by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] and [[Spain]], the French intervention in Mexico was a consequence of Mexican President [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]]'s imposition of a two-year moratorium of loan-interest payments from July 1861 to French, British, and Spanish creditors.<ref name=\"Chartrand\"/>{{rp|6}}\n\nTo extend the influence of Imperial France, [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]] instigated the intervention in Mexico by claiming that the military adventure was a foreign policy commitment to [[free trade]]. The establishment of a friendly monarchy in Mexico would ensure European access to Latin American markets; and French access to Mexican silver. To realize his imperial ambitions without interference from other European nations, Napoleon III entered into a coalition with the United Kingdom and Spain, while the United States was occupied with [[American Civil War|its civil war]] and unable to enforce the [[Monroe Doctrine]].<ref name=\"Chartrand\"/>{{rp|3}}\n\nThe Monroe Doctrine was an American policy, written by James Monroe and issued in December 1823, that warned against further European imperialism in the Americas.

So the Union's stance would have no real political significance to either Britain or Spain. Like England, France had already abolished slavery, but they wanted to keep Maximilian in Mexico. The French government knew that a unified America would once again enforce the Monroe Doctrine, so the Confederacy was tempting as a buffer nation to protect their Latin reign. While technically, the French government never recognized the Confederacy, that does not mean that the nation as a whole ignored the American Civil War.

On 8 December, the Spanish fleet disembarked troops at the port of [[Veracruz]], on the Gulf of Mexico. When the British and the Spanish discovered that France had unilaterally planned to seize Mexico, they withdrew from the military coalition agreed in London.

They were forced to make a defence in a nearby [[hacienda]]. Danjou was mortally wounded at the hacienda, and his men mounted an almost suicidal bayonet attack, fighting to nearly the last man; only three French Legionnaires survived.

Puebla surrendered to the French shortly afterward, on 17 May. On 31 May, President Ju\u00e1rez fled the city with his cabinet, retreating northward to [[Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez|Paso del Norte]] and later to [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]]. Having taken the treasure of the state with them, the government-in-exile remained in Chihuahua until 1867.\n\nFrench troops under Bazaine entered [[Mexico City]] on 7 June 1863. The main army entered the city three days later led by General Forey. General Almonte was appointed the provisional President of Mexico on 16 June, by the Superior Junta (which had been appointed by Forey). The Superior Junta with its 35 members met on 21 June and proclaimed a Catholic Empire on 10 July. The crown was offered to Maximilian, following pressures by Napoleon. Maximilian accepted the crown on 3 October, at the hands of the Comisi\u00f3n Mexicana, sent by the Superior Junta.\n\n==Arrival of Maximilian==\n[[File:Maximilian emperor of Mexico.jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Maximilian of Mexico|Maximilian I]] of Mexico]]\n\nOn 28 and 31 March 1864, men from the French [[man-of-war]] ''[[French ship Cordeli\u00e8re|Cordeli\u00e8re]]'' tried [[Capture of Mazatl\u00e1n|to take Mazatl\u00e1n]], but were initially repelled by Mexicans commanded by Colonel [[Gaspar S\u00e1nchez Ochoa]].\n\nThe French under Bazaine occupied [[Guadalajara, Jalisco|Guadalajara]] on 6 January 1864, and troops under Douay occupied [[Zacatecas, Zacatecas|Zacatecas]] on 6 February. Further decisive French victories continued with the [[Battle of Acapulco|fall of Acapulco]] on 3 June, occupation of [[Durango, Durango|Durango]] on 3 July, and the defeat of republicans in the states of [[Sinaloa]] and [[Jalisco]] in November.\n\nMaximilian formally accepted the crown on 10 April, signing the [[s:Treaty of Miramar|Treaty of Miramar]], and landed at Veracruz on 28 May (or possibly 29 May) 1864 in the [[SMS Novara (1850)|SMS ''Novara'']]. He was enthroned as Maximilian, Emperor of Mexico, with his wife [[Charlotte of Belgium]], known by the Spanish form of her name, Carlota. In reality, Maximilian was a puppet monarch of the [[Second French Empire]].\n\nMaximilian expressed progressive European political ideas, favouring the establishment of a limited monarchy sharing powers with a democratically elected congress. He inspired passage of laws to abolish child labour, limit working hours, and abolish a system of land tenancy that virtually amounted to serfdom among the Indians. This was too liberal to please Mexico's conservatives, and the nation's liberals refused to accept a monarch, leaving Maximilian with few enthusiastic allies within Mexico.\n\nOn Sunday, 13 November 1864, three [[France|French]] [[men-of-war]] (''[[French ship Victoire|Victoire]]'', ''[[French ship D'Assas|D'Assas]]'' and ''[[French ship Diamante|Diamante]]'') shelled [[Mazatl\u00e1n]] 13 times, and Imperial Mexican forces under [[Manuel Lozada]] entered and [[Capture of Mazatl\u00e1n|captured the city]].\n\n\n==Early Republican victories==\n[[File:Benito Pablo Ju\u00e1rez Garc\u00eda.png|thumb|left|200px|[[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], Republican leader and President]]\nThe French continued with victories in 1865, with Bazaine capturing [[Oaxaca, Oaxaca|Oaxaca]] on 9 February (defeating the city's defenders under General [[Porfirio D\u00edaz]]). The French fleet landed soldiers who captured [[Guaymas]] on 29 March.\n\nBut on 11 April, republicans defeated Imperial forces at [[Battle of Tac\u00e1mbaro|Tac\u00e1mbaro]] in [[Michoac\u00e1n]]. In April and May the republicans had many forces in the states of [[Sinaloa]] and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]]. Most towns along the [[Rio Grande]] were also occupied by republicans.\n\nThe decree known as the \"[[Black Decree]]\" was issued by Maximilian on 3 October, which threatened any Mexican captured in the war with immediate execution. This was later the basis for the next government to order his own execution. Several high-ranking republican officials were executed under this order on 21 October.\n\n==U.S. diplomacy and involvement==\nAs early as 1859, U.S. and Mexican efforts to ratify the [[McLane-Ocampo Treaty]] had failed in the bitterly divided [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], where tensions were high between the North and the South over other issues. Such a treaty would have allowed U.S. construction in Mexico and protection from European forces in exchange for a payment of $4 million to the heavily indebted government of Benito Ju\u00e1rez. On 3 December 1860, President [[James Buchanan]] had delivered a speech stating his displeasure at being unable to secure Mexico from European interference: \n\t\n<blockquote>European governments would have been deprived of all pretext to interfere in the territorial and domestic concerns of Mexico. We should have thus been relieved from the obligation of resisting, even by force, should this become necessary, any attempt of these governments to deprive our neighboring Republic of portions of her territory, a duty from which we could not shrink without abandoning the traditional and established policy of the American people.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Manning|first=William R. |author2=James Morton Callahan |author3=John H.

President [[Abraham Lincoln]] expressed his sympathy to Latin American republics against any European attempt to establish a monarchy. Shortly after the establishment of the Imperial government  in April 1864, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[William H. Seward]], while maintaining U.S. neutrality, expressed U.S. discomfort at the imposition of a monarchy in Mexico: \"Nor can the United States deny that their own safety and destiny to which they aspire are intimately dependent on the continuance of free republican institutions throughout America.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last=Manning|first=William R. |author2=James Morton Callahan |author3=John H.

[[Miguel Miram\u00f3n]], right It is one of 5 versions of his renderings of the event.]]\n\nThe Republicans occupied the rest of the states of Zacatecas, San Luis Potos\u00ed and Guanajuato in January. The French evacuated the capital on 5 February.\n\nOn 13 February 1867, Maximilian withdrew to [[Santiago de Quer\u00e9taro|Quer\u00e9taro]]. The Republicans began a siege of the city on 9 March, and Mexico City on 12 April. An imperial sortie from Quer\u00e9taro failed on 27 April.\n\nOn 11 May, Maximilian resolved to try to escape through the enemy lines. He was intercepted on 15 May. Following a court-martial, he was sentenced to death. Many of the crowned heads of Europe and other prominent figures (including liberals [[Victor Hugo]] and [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]]) sent telegrams and letters to Mexico pleading for Maximilian's life to be spared, but Ju\u00e1rez refused to commute the sentence. He believed he had to send a strong message that Mexico would not tolerate any government imposed by foreign powers.\n\nMaximilian was executed on 19 June (along with his generals [[Miguel Miram\u00f3n]] and [[Tom\u00e1s Mej\u00eda]]) on the [[Cerro de las Campanas]], a hill on the outskirts of Quer\u00e9taro, by the forces loyal to President Benito Ju\u00e1rez, who had kept the federal government functioning during the French intervention. Mexico City surrendered the day after Maximilian was executed.\n\nThe republic was restored, and President Ju\u00e1rez was returned to power in the national capital. He made few changes in policy, given that the progressive Maximilian had upheld most of Ju\u00e1rez's liberal reforms.\n\nAfter the victory, the Conservative party was so thoroughly discredited by its alliance with the invading French troops that it effectively became defunct. The Liberal party was almost unchallenged as a political force during the first years of the \"restored republic\". In 1871, however, Ju\u00e1rez was re-elected to yet another term as president in spite of a constitutional prohibition of re-elections.\n\n[[Porfirio D\u00edaz]] (a Liberal general and a hero of the French war, but increasingly conservative in outlook), one of the losing candidates, launched a rebellion against the president. Supported by conservative factions within the Liberal party, the attempted revolt (the so-called [[Plan de la Noria]]) was already at the point of defeat when Ju\u00e1rez died in office on 19 July 1872, making it a moot point. D\u00edaz ran against interim president [[Sebasti\u00e1n Lerdo de Tejada]], lost the election, and retired to his [[hacienda]] in [[Oaxaca]]. Four years later, in 1876, when Lerdo ran for re-election, D\u00edaz launched a second, successful revolt (the [[Plan de Tuxtepec]]) and captured the presidency. He held it through eight terms until 1911, a period when he jailed many political opponents at the fort off Veracruz.\n\n==Divisions and disembarkation of allied troops==\n\n===French expeditionary force, 31 December 1862===\n[[File:L\u00e9gionnaire-Mexique.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Campaign uniform of a French Foreign legionary during the Mexican campaign]]\nAt its peak in 1863, the French expeditionary force counted 38,493 men<ref name=\"Niox\"/> {{rp|740}} (which represented 16.25% of the [[French army]]).<ref name=\"Raymond\">{{cite journal\n  |journal = [[The New York Times]]\n  |author = \n  |authorlink = \n  | editor-last = Raymond\n  | editor-first = Henry Jarvis\n  |title = The military force of France.; The Actual Organization of the Army Its Strength and Effectiveness.
