Through a friend Quirk met the Melbourne fashion photographer and stylist couple Bruno & Hazel Benini who gave him access to their darkroom in which to process his surfing shots. His first published photograph was in the [[The Herald (Melbourne)|Melbourne Herald]] for an article on [[Bells Beach, Victoria|Bells Beach]] by Victorian surf champion Rod Brooks. \n\nIn 1970 Bruno Benini encouraged him to enter [[Ilford Photo|Ilford Australia's]] national competition the 'Age of Aquarius' for a return trip to London, in which he was short listed in the final ten, though then disqualified as an amateur. He went on to assist Benini, who arranged a meeting for him with the contest winner [[Paul Cox (director)|Paul Cox]],<ref>'UK trip for photo winner', in ''The Age'', Sat, 19 September 1970, p.5</ref> who was lecturer in photography at [[Prahran College|Prahran College of Advanced Education]].

There, he also taught part-time at [[Sydney College of the Arts]] and later was a  foundation lecturer at the [[Australian Centre for Photography]]. With Grenville Turner and Mark Lang, Quirk worked from a  Surry Hills studio run by Anthony Browell & Graham McCarter, before founding the Wildlight Agency. In 1982 he traveled to Wales to research and photograph for a book on the [[eisteddfod]] there and in Australia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126895892 |title=LETTERS to the Editor |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=15 May 1982 |access-date=15 February 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref>\n\n=== Wildlight ===\n[[Rick Smolan]]'s ''A Day in the Life of Australia'' project through 1981-2,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55190629|title=A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AUSTRALIA|date=18 November 1981|newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|access-date=15 February 2020|location=Australia, Australia|page=1 (A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AUSTRALIA)|via=Trove}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author1=Park, Andy|title=A day in the life of Australia|date=1981|publisher=A Day in the life of Australia Pty Ltd|isbn=978-0-9594244-0-9|author2=Smolan, Rick}}</ref> was a catalyst for the origins of Wildlight Photo Agency.

During the project, they met and socialised with the influential international photographers, many of whom were attached to agencies, and later, in reencountering some who returned on their way to shoot assignments, they became inspired to establish their own, believing an Australian agency could deliver a better conduit to international magazines and publishers for Australian imagery.

Despite two decades of degradation the remaining scenic resources of our country are awe-inspiring. No one interested in our native flora should miss this show.\"}}\nIn her summation of the year 1989 in photography, [[Beatrice Faust]] singled out Quirk's wilderness imagery in that exhibition as \u201cexquisitely coloured and [using] natural light in a uniquely creative way.\u201d<ref>Beatrice Faust, \u2018A year of sapphires and garlic,\u2019 in The Age, Friday, Jan 5, 1990 p.10</ref> and earlier elaborated;\n{{quotation|\"Light is the key to Quirk\u2019s fascination. The true subject of his work is not just the furnishings of the landscape but the space and light that gives it life. He uses delicate bounce light from snow to bring out the extraordinarily subtle colours in rocks that most of us would see as black, or catches the horizontal light of sunrise and sunset to bring out the colour latent in grass and foliage.\"<ref>Beatrice Faust, \u2018Quirk gets national heritage in focus,\u2019 in The Age, Monday Jun 26, 1989, p.14</ref>}}\n== Recent career ==\nAt the end of 2003, after eighteen years, Quirk stood down as managing director of Wildlight Photo Agency and is presently living in Sydney and archiving its output. Since his retirement from the Agency, Quirk has undertaken a series of speaking engagements including the 2003 David Moore Lecture and the 2004 [[Walkley Awards|Walkley]] Forum, as well as gallery floor talks and presentations to Media Arts students.\n\nIn 2005 Quirk was commissioned by the NSW Farmers Association to make a series of portraits of farming families and their working life in 13 regions of [[New South Wales]]. He followed that with a project during the continuing drought in 2006 in [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]], to produce a broader series which documented the landscape, [[Arable land|arable farming]], and the natural environment with portraits to illustrate the subjects\u2019 relationships with the land, accompanied with text recording their concerns over drought and environmental degradation caused by reduced water flows in the two major river systems in the district.\n\n== Photographic educator ==\nAmidst his professional work, Quirk continued his teaching activities and was Chairman for Australia and NZ of the [[World Press Photo]] Joop Swart Masterclass 1998 - 2013. The event was held in the [[Netherlands]] annually and 12 photographers under 31 years of age from around the world are selected to attend.  The objective of this competitive award is to advance their [[professional development]].  Australian recipients of this award in 2010 included [[Trent Parke]], [[Jesse Marlow]] and [[Adam Ferguson (photographer)|Adam Ferguson]].\n\nQuirk has won industry awards and government grants for his projects which have included a commission from the organisation 'Beyond Empathy' which uses  arts intervention to address the deficits experienced by disadvantaged individuals and communities.  For them, over 2006/7 Quirk taught and work-shopped photographic portraiture in two communities in [[New South Wales]] at [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]] and [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] to young mothers, many of them teenagers, and to male teenagers who were often in trouble with the law. He also made portraits of individuals in the groups.\n\nIn advancing his own education, during 2009-2011 Quirk undertook a [[Master's degree|Master's Degree]] by Research, [[School of Fine Arts|COFA]], [[University of New South Wales]].\n\n== Industry representative ==\nQuirk has been active in representing his industry, and was spokesperson for the Society of Advertising, Commercial and Magazine Photographers (ACMP) on copyright issues (1998 - 2004); Chairman of Judges, ACMP Photographer Collection Melbourne in 2000; and judge for the Nikon Walkley Foundation Photographic Awards in 2008.\n\n== Lecturer in Photography ==\n*[[Gordon Institute of TAFE|Gordon Institute of Technology]] (now Deakin University)\n*[[Sydney College of the Arts]] \u2013 part-time lecturer\n*[[Australian Centre for Photography]] \u2013 foundation lecturer\n*[[University of Tasmania]] Art School - guest lecturer\n*[[Charles Sturt University]] NSW  - guest lecturer\n* Short course lecturer COFA [[University of New South Wales|University of NSW]]\n*[[Photography Studies College]]\n\n== Authored books ==\n* {{Citation | author1=Quirk, Philip | author2=Feddersen, Melanie.

known for his specialist imagery of landscape, geographic and documentary photography, and as a founding member of the Wildlight agency.\n\n== Early life and education ==\nPhilip Quirk was born in Melbourne, Australia on 11 November 1948 to Valentine Quirk, a communications engineer, and mother Phyl.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nla.gov.au/nla.party-538286|title=Quirk, Philip (1948-) - People and organisations|website=Trove|language=en|access-date=2020-02-13}}</ref> He grew up with a younger sister and older brother in [[St Kilda East, Victoria|East St Kilda]] & [[Caulfield, Victoria|Caulfield]] and attended [[Christian Brothers College, St Kilda|St Kilda Christian Brothers College]] where he completed [[Matriculation examination|Matriculation]] before briefly studying Business at [[RMIT University|RMIT]]. \n\nFrom the age of 14 he had been a keen surfer around [[Torquay, Victoria|Torquay]], but in a 1969 car accident he suffered a severely broken arm and over the year that it took to recover, he started to photograph his surfer friends with a 35mm [[Pentax Spotmatic]] and [[Telephoto lens|telephoto]] 500mm F5.5 [[Takumar|Takumar lens]]. Through a friend Quirk met the Melbourne fashion photographer and stylist couple Bruno & Hazel Benini who gave him access to their darkroom in which to process his surfing shots. His first published photograph was in the [[The Herald (Melbourne)|Melbourne Herald]] for an article on [[Bells Beach, Victoria|Bells Beach]] by Victorian surf champion Rod Brooks. \n\nIn 1970 Bruno Benini encouraged him to enter [[Ilford Photo|Ilford Australia's]] national competition the 'Age of Aquarius' for a return trip to London, in which he was short listed in the final ten, though then disqualified as an amateur. He went on to assist Benini, who arranged a meeting for him with the contest winner [[Paul Cox (director)|Paul Cox]],<ref>'UK trip for photo winner', in ''The Age'', Sat, 19 September 1970, p.5</ref> who was lecturer in photography at [[Prahran College|Prahran College of Advanced Education]].

There, he also taught part-time at [[Sydney College of the Arts]] and later was a  foundation lecturer at the [[Australian Centre for Photography]]. With Grenville Turner and Mark Lang, Quirk worked from a  Surry Hills studio run by Anthony Browell & Graham McCarter, before founding the Wildlight Agency. In 1982 he traveled to Wales to research and photograph for a book on the [[eisteddfod]] there and in Australia.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126895892 |title=LETTERS to the Editor |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=Australian Capital Territory, Australia |date=15 May 1982 |access-date=15 February 2020 |page=2 |via=Trove }}</ref>\n\n=== Wildlight ===\n[[Rick Smolan]]'s ''A Day in the Life of Australia'' project through 1981-2,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article55190629|title=A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AUSTRALIA|date=18 November 1981|newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]|access-date=15 February 2020|location=Australia, Australia|page=1 (A DAY IN THE LIFE OF AUSTRALIA)|via=Trove}}</ref><ref>{{Citation|author1=Park, Andy|title=A day in the life of Australia|date=1981|publisher=A Day in the life of Australia Pty Ltd|isbn=978-0-9594244-0-9|author2=Smolan, Rick}}</ref> was a catalyst for the origins of Wildlight Photo Agency.

No one interested in our native flora should miss this show.\"}}\nIn her summation of the year 1989 in photography, [[Beatrice Faust]] singled out Quirk's wilderness imagery in that exhibition as \u201cexquisitely coloured and [using] natural light in a uniquely creative way.\u201d<ref>Beatrice Faust, \u2018A year of sapphires and garlic,\u2019 in The Age, Friday, Jan 5, 1990 p.10</ref> and earlier elaborated;\n{{quotation|\"Light is the key to Quirk\u2019s fascination. The true subject of his work is not just the furnishings of the landscape but the space and light that gives it life. He uses delicate bounce light from snow to bring out the extraordinarily subtle colours in rocks that most of us would see as black, or catches the horizontal light of sunrise and sunset to bring out the colour latent in grass and foliage.\"<ref>Beatrice Faust, \u2018Quirk gets national heritage in focus,\u2019 in The Age, Monday Jun 26, 1989, p.14</ref>}}\n== Recent career ==\nAt the end of 2003, after eighteen years, Quirk stood down as managing director of Wildlight Photo Agency and is presently living in Sydney and archiving its output. Since his retirement from the Agency, Quirk has undertaken a series of speaking engagements including the 2003 David Moore Lecture and the 2004 [[Walkley Awards|Walkley]] Forum, as well as gallery floor talks and presentations to Media Arts students.\n\nIn 2005 Quirk was commissioned by the NSW Farmers Association to make a series of portraits of farming families and their working life in 13 regions of [[New South Wales]]. He followed that with a project during the continuing drought in 2006 in [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]], to produce a broader series which documented the landscape, [[Arable land|arable farming]], and the natural environment with portraits to illustrate the subjects\u2019 relationships with the land, accompanied with text recording their concerns over drought and environmental degradation caused by reduced water flows in the two major river systems in the district.\n\n== Photographic educator ==\nAmidst his professional work, Quirk continued his teaching activities and was Chairman for Australia and NZ of the [[World Press Photo]] Joop Swart Masterclass 1998 - 2013. The event was held in the [[Netherlands]] annually and 12 photographers under 31 years of age from around the world are selected to attend.  The objective of this competitive award is to advance their [[professional development]].  Australian recipients of this award in 2010 included [[Trent Parke]], [[Jesse Marlow]] and [[Adam Ferguson (photographer)|Adam Ferguson]].\n\nQuirk has won industry awards and government grants for his projects which have included a commission from the organisation 'Beyond Empathy' which uses  arts intervention to address the deficits experienced by disadvantaged individuals and communities.  For them, over 2006/7 Quirk taught and work-shopped photographic portraiture in two communities in [[New South Wales]] at [[Moree, New South Wales|Moree]] and [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] to young mothers, many of them teenagers, and to male teenagers who were often in trouble with the law. He also made portraits of individuals in the groups.\n\nIn advancing his own education, during 2009-2011 Quirk undertook a [[Master's degree|Master's Degree]] by Research, [[School of Fine Arts|COFA]], [[University of New South Wales]].\n\n== Industry representative ==\nQuirk has been active in representing his industry, and was spokesperson for the Society of Advertising, Commercial and Magazine Photographers (ACMP) on copyright issues (1998 - 2004); Chairman of Judges, ACMP Photographer Collection Melbourne in 2000; and judge for the Nikon Walkley Foundation Photographic Awards in 2008.\n\n== Lecturer in Photography ==\n*[[Gordon Institute of TAFE|Gordon Institute of Technology]] (now Deakin University)\n*[[Sydney College of the Arts]] \u2013 part-time lecturer\n*[[Australian Centre for Photography]] \u2013 foundation lecturer\n*[[University of Tasmania]] Art School - guest lecturer\n*[[Charles Sturt University]] NSW  - guest lecturer\n* Short course lecturer COFA [[University of New South Wales|University of NSW]]\n*[[Photography Studies College]]\n\n== Authored books ==\n* {{Citation | author1=Quirk, Philip | author2=Feddersen, Melanie.

It is often thought to be a [[self-portrait]]. During the [[Second World War]] the painting was [[Nazi plunder|stolen by Germans from Poland]]. Many historians regard it as the most important painting missing since World War II.<ref name=\"pacb2004\">Winid, Boguslaw. [http://pacb.bfn.org/calendar/winid.html \"Not Lost Forever: Recovery of Polish Art Looted During WWII,\"] Polish Art club of Buffalo. 3 April 2004.</ref><ref name=\"czartoryski\" /> It is suggested that, if found, the painting would be worth in excess of 100 million US dollars today.\n\nThe portrait is in oil on [[panel painting|panel]], probably from 1513 to 1514, and is by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] [[Old Master]] painter and architect Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino better known simply as [[Raphael]].<ref name=\"houpt49\">Houpt, Simon ''et al.'' (2006). ''Museum of the Missing,'' p. 49.</ref>\nThe subject's identity is unverified, but many scholars have traditionally regarded it as Raphael's [[self-portrait]]. The facial features are perceived by specialists as compatible with, if not clearly identical to, the only undoubted self-portrait by Raphael in his [[fresco]] ''[[The School of Athens]]'' at the Vatican, identified as such by [[Vasari]]. If it is a self-portrait, no hint is given of Raphael's profession; the portrait shows a richly dressed and \"confidently poised\" young man.<ref>Jones, Roger ''et al.'' (1983). ''Raphael'', p. 170\u2013171.</ref>  \n\nNo colour photographs of the painting were made before it disappeared; the colour image has been artificially coloured.\n\n==Analysis==\nAs a portrait painting of the High Renaissance, Raphael's emphasis on erect poise, gesture, texture, decorous ornament, and softened form all represented cultivated Mannerist expression with the attributes of the noble class in a style which spread through southern Italy after Raphael's death. The textural details of a flesh-colored wall, sable fur, and wavy dark hair not only strike a Neo-Classical, sensitive balance between real humanity and nature, but they also extend gestures seen in previous female hand placement to stress man's role as a well-travelled humanist. Raphael humanized male gender so that the sleeve ribbon and hazy edges around both hair and landscape reflected the interchangeability of each gender. A left palm placed near the heart emphasized self-identity and a passionate stance. A striking contrast between pure white and sable intensified the doctrinal harmony between Heaven and Earth.\n\nIt is probable that Raphael's studious approach to the idealized representation of human proportion was based on his studies of ancient athletic and military heroes in Classical sculpture such as [[Doryphoros]] and [[Augustus of Prima Porta]]. The painting was brought to Poland, along with [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' and many [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[antiquities]], by Prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]], son of Princess [[Izabela Czartoryska]], on his travels to Italy in 1798.<ref name=\"czartoryski\" />\n\n== The Nazi theft == \nAt the onset of the [[Nazi]] [[German invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]] in 1939, then family patriarch [[Augustyn J\u00f3zef Czartoryski|Prince Augustyn J\u00f3zef Czartoryski]] rescued numerous pieces from the [[Czartoryski Museum]], including ''Portrait of a Young Man'',  Leonardo's ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' and a [[Rembrandt]] masterpiece.  The collection was hidden at a residence in [[Sieniawa]], but was later discovered by the [[Gestapo]], working for [[Hans Frank]], Hitler's appointee as the governor of the [[General Government]].<ref name=\"czartoryski\" /> From the collection, these three paintings decorated Frank's residence in [[Krak\u00f3w]] before they were sent to [[Berlin]],<ref name=\"houpt49\"/> and [[Dresden]], to become part of the F\u00fchrer's own collection at [[Linz]], arranged by Hitler's plenipotentiary, Dr. Posse.<ref name=\"czartoryski\" />\n\nIn January 1945, Frank brought the paintings back from Germany to Krak\u00f3w for his own use at the royal [[Wawel Castle]]. This is where ''Portrait of a Young Man'' was last seen.<ref name=\"pacb2004\"/> When the Germans evacuated from Krak\u00f3w later that month ahead of the Soviet offensive, it is thought that Frank took the paintings with him to [[Silesia]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/could-looted-art-from-wwii-be-hidden-under-village-chapel-3713|title=Could looted art from WWII be hidden under village chapel?|website=www.thefirstnews.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> and then to his own villa in {{Interlanguage link multi|Neuhaus am Schliersee|de|3=Neuhaus (Schliersee)}}.{{cn|date=January 2017}} The Americans arrested Frank on May 3, 1945 pending trial for extensive war crimes (he was executed in 1946). The Polish representative at the Allies Commission for the Retrieval of Works of Art located some of the paintings stolen by him, and claimed them on behalf of the Czartoryski Museum.

It is often thought to be a [[self-portrait]]. During the [[Second World War]] the painting was [[Nazi plunder|stolen by Germans from Poland]]. Many historians regard it as the most important painting missing since World War II.<ref name=\"pacb2004\">Winid, Boguslaw. [http://pacb.bfn.org/calendar/winid.html \"Not Lost Forever: Recovery of Polish Art Looted During WWII,\"] Polish Art club of Buffalo. 3 April 2004.</ref><ref name=\"czartoryski\" /> It is suggested that, if found, the painting would be worth in excess of 100 million US dollars today.\n\nThe portrait is in oil on [[panel painting|panel]], probably from 1513 to 1514, and is by the [[Italy|Italian]] [[High Renaissance]] [[Old Master]] painter and architect Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino better known simply as [[Raphael]].<ref name=\"houpt49\">Houpt, Simon ''et al.'' (2006). ''Museum of the Missing,'' p. 49.</ref>\nThe subject's identity is unverified, but many scholars have traditionally regarded it as Raphael's [[self-portrait]]. The facial features are perceived by specialists as compatible with, if not clearly identical to, the only undoubted self-portrait by Raphael in his [[fresco]] ''[[The School of Athens]]'' at the Vatican, identified as such by [[Vasari]]. If it is a self-portrait, no hint is given of Raphael's profession; the portrait shows a richly dressed and \"confidently poised\" young man.<ref>Jones, Roger ''et al.'' (1983). ''Raphael'', p. 170\u2013171.</ref>  \n\nNo colour photographs of the painting were made before it disappeared; the colour image has been artificially coloured.\n\n==Analysis==\nAs a portrait painting of the High Renaissance, Raphael's emphasis on erect poise, gesture, texture, decorous ornament, and softened form all represented cultivated Mannerist expression with the attributes of the noble class in a style which spread through southern Italy after Raphael's death. The textural details of a flesh-colored wall, sable fur, and wavy dark hair not only strike a Neo-Classical, sensitive balance between real humanity and nature, but they also extend gestures seen in previous female hand placement to stress man's role as a well-travelled humanist. Raphael humanized male gender so that the sleeve ribbon and hazy edges around both hair and landscape reflected the interchangeability of each gender. A left palm placed near the heart emphasized self-identity and a passionate stance. A striking contrast between pure white and sable intensified the doctrinal harmony between Heaven and Earth.\n\nIt is probable that Raphael's studious approach to the idealized representation of human proportion was based on his studies of ancient athletic and military heroes in Classical sculpture such as [[Doryphoros]] and [[Augustus of Prima Porta]]. The painting was brought to Poland, along with [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' and many [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[antiquities]], by Prince [[Adam Jerzy Czartoryski]], son of Princess [[Izabela Czartoryska]], on his travels to Italy in 1798.<ref name=\"czartoryski\" />\n\n== The Nazi theft == \nAt the onset of the [[Nazi]] [[German invasion of Poland|invasion of Poland]] in 1939, then family patriarch [[Augustyn J\u00f3zef Czartoryski|Prince Augustyn J\u00f3zef Czartoryski]] rescued numerous pieces from the [[Czartoryski Museum]], including ''Portrait of a Young Man'',  Leonardo's ''[[Lady with an Ermine]]'' and a [[Rembrandt]] masterpiece.  The collection was hidden at a residence in [[Sieniawa]], but was later discovered by the [[Gestapo]], working for [[Hans Frank]], Hitler's appointee as the governor of the [[General Government]].<ref name=\"czartoryski\" /> From the collection, these three paintings decorated Frank's residence in [[Krak\u00f3w]] before they were sent to [[Berlin]],<ref name=\"houpt49\"/> and [[Dresden]], to become part of the F\u00fchrer's own collection at [[Linz]], arranged by Hitler's plenipotentiary, Dr. Posse.<ref name=\"czartoryski\" />\n\nIn January 1945, Frank brought the paintings back from Germany to Krak\u00f3w for his own use at the royal [[Wawel Castle]]. This is where ''Portrait of a Young Man'' was last seen.<ref name=\"pacb2004\"/> When the Germans evacuated from Krak\u00f3w later that month ahead of the Soviet offensive, it is thought that Frank took the paintings with him to [[Silesia]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thefirstnews.com/article/could-looted-art-from-wwii-be-hidden-under-village-chapel-3713|title=Could looted art from WWII be hidden under village chapel?|website=www.thefirstnews.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref> and then to his own villa in {{Interlanguage link multi|Neuhaus am Schliersee|de|3=Neuhaus (Schliersee)}}.{{cn|date=January 2017}} The Americans arrested Frank on May 3, 1945 pending trial for extensive war crimes (he was executed in 1946).
