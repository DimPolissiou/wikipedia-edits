[[Russian inventors]] and engineers excelled in such areas as [[electrical engineering]], [[shipbuilding]], [[aerospace]], [[weaponry]], [[communications]], [[Information technology|IT]], [[nuclear technology]] and [[space technology]].\n\nMore recently, the crisis of the 1990s led to the drastic reduction of state support for science and technology, leading many Russian scientists and university graduates to move to Europe or the United States. In the 2000s, on the wave of a new economic boom, the situation has improved, and the government [[Medvedev modernisation programme|launched a campaign]] aimed into [[modernisation]] and [[innovation]] with mixed success.<ref name=\"Medvedev priorities\">[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20091011/156428675.html Rian.ru] [[RIA Novosti]]: Medvedev outlines priorities for Russian economy's modernization</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|Timeline of Russian inventions and technology records|Russian scientists|Russian inventors}}\n[[File:M.V. Lomonosov by L.Miropolskiy after G.C.Prenner (1787, RAN).jpg|thumb|160px|[[Mikhail Lomonosov]], Russian [[polymath]] scientist, inventor, poet and artist, the founder of [[Moscow State University]].]]\nAt the start of the 18th century the [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|reforms of Peter the Great]] (founder of the Russian Academy of Sciences and Saint Petersburg State University) and the work of such champions as polymath Mikhail Lomonosov (the founder of Moscow State University) gave a great boost to the development of science and innovation in Russia.\n\nMany famous Russian scientists and inventors were [[\u00e9migr\u00e9s]], like [[Igor Sikorsky]], credited with the invention of the first helicopters, [[Vladimir Zworykin]], often called the father of TV, chemist [[Ilya Prigogine]], noted for his work on [[dissipative system|dissipative structures]] and [[complex systems]] (1977 [[Nobel Prize for Chemistry]]), economists [[Simon Kuznets]] (1971 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]) and [[Wassily Leontief]] (1973 [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize]]), physicist [[Georgiy Gamov]] (an author of the [[Big Bang]] theory), engineer [[Alexander M. Poniatoff]], who created the world's first [[rotary transformer|rotary head recorder]] and social scientist [[Pitirim Sorokin]] who played an important role in development of sociology in the US. Many foreigners such as [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Alfred Nobel]] worked in Russia for a long time.\n\nDespite many technological achievements in the 19th and 20th centuries, since the time of [[Brezhnev stagnation]] Russia has lagged significantly behind [[Western world|the West]] in a number of technologies, especially those concerning [[energy conservation]] and [[consumer goods]] production. The crisis of the 1990s led to the drastic reduction of state support for science. Many Russian scientists and university graduates left Russia for Europe or United States; this migration is known as a \"[[brain drain]]\".\n\nIn the 2000s, on the wave of a new economic boom, the situation in the Russian science and technology has improved, and the government launched a campaign to encourage modernisation and innovation. Russian President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] formulated the top five priorities for the country's technological development: [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]], IT (including both common products and the products combined with [[space technology]]), [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and [[pharmaceuticals]].<ref name=\"Medvedev priorities\"/> Some progress already has been achieved, with Russia's having nearly completed [[GLONASS]], the only global [[satellite navigation system]] apart from American [[GPS]], and Russia's being the only country constructing [[Russian floating nuclear power station|mobile nuclear plants]].\n\n==Science and education==\n{{main|Russian Academy of Sciences|Education in Russia|List of Russian scientists}}\n\n===Physics===\n{{main|List of Russian physicists}}\nThe Russian [[physics]] school began to develop after Lomonosov who proposed the law of conservation of matter preceding the [[energy conservation law]]. Early in the development of [[electrodynamics]], [[Vasily Vladimirovich Petrov|Vasily Petrov]] discovered the [[electric arc]] effect in 1802 and [[Heinrich Lenz]] discovered the important [[Lenz's law|law]] named in his honor. [[Nikolay Umov]] discovered a fundamental concept of the [[Umov\u2013Poynting vector]] and was the first scientist to indicate an interrelation between mass and energy, proposing the formula [[Mass\u2013energy equivalence|<math>E=kmc^2</math>]] as early as in 1873.<ref>''\u0423\u043c\u043e\u0432 \u041d. \u0410.'' \u0418\u0437\u0431\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0435 \u0441\u043e\u0447\u0438\u043d\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f. \u041c. \u2014 \u041b., 1950.</ref> [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]] was among the [[invention of radio|inventors of radio]].\n\nDuring the 20th century, Russian and Soviet scientists were among the world leaders in physics. [[Alexander Friedmann]] was the first scientist to propose an expanding universe model in 1922 which greatly influenced cosmology in the 20th century. [[Georgiy Gamov]]  proposed the theory of the [[alpha decay]] of a nucleus via [[quantum tunneling|tunnelling]] (1928) and was an author of the Big Bang theory. [[Dmitri Ivanenko]] was the first to propose the proton-neutron model of [[atomic nuclei]] (1932) and [[nuclear shell model]] (1932).\n\n[[Nikolay Nikolaevich Bogolyubov|Nikolay Bogolyubov]] suggested a triplet [[quark]] model, introducing a new quantum degree of freedom (later called as [[color charge]]) for quarks<ref>N.

After such prominent scientists as [[Chebyshev]] the Russian mathematical school became one of the most influential in the world and was represented by numerous figures greatly contributing to different fields of mathematics, physics and computing sciences.<ref>{{cite web|title=Russian Mathematicians in the 20th Century|publisher=Princeton University |url=http://www.worldscibooks.com/mathematics/4499.html|accessdate=10 Apr 2010}}</ref> Chebyshev's students included [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]] who founded the modern [[stability theory]] (lately developed by such scientists as [[Aleksandr Andronov]] and [[Vladimir Arnold]]), and [[Andrey Markov]] who developed the theory of [[Markov chain]]s, playing a central role in information sciences and modern applied mathematics.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]] and [[Sergei Chaplygin]] were among founding fathers of the modern [[aerodynamics|aero-]] and [[hydrodynamics]] and [[Vladimir Aleksandrovich Kotelnikov|Vladimir Kotelnikov]] was a pioneer in [[information theory]] by independently proposing the fundamental [[sampling theorem]]. [[Andrei Kolmogorov]], a leading mathematician of the 20th century, developed the foundation of the modern [[theory of probability]] and made other key contributions to broadest range of mathematical branches, such as [[turbulence]], [[mathematical logic]], [[topology]], [[differential equations]], [[set theory]], [[automata theory]], [[information theory]], [[theory of algorithms]], [[dynamical systems]], [[stochastic processes]], [[Integral|theory of integration]], [[classical mechanics]], [[mathematical linguistics]], [[mathematical biology]] and applied sciences. [[Israel Gelfand]] is credited with many important discoveries in algebra, topology, mathematical physics and applied sciences. [[Sergei Sobolev]] developed the theory of [[Sobolev space]] which played an extremely important role in formation of modern mathematical views and introduced the notion of [[distribution (mathematics)|distributions]] generalizing ideas of Newton and Leibniz.\n\nSuch mathematicians as [[Lev Pontryagin]], who made major contributions to topology and functional analysis and a founder of the modern [[optimal control]] theory, [[Andrey Nikolayevich Tychonoff|Andrey Tychonoff]], who was the author of the [[Tychonoff's theorem|\"central theorem\"]]<ref>{{cite book|author-link=John L.

[[Nikolai Koltsov]], a founder of [[molecular biology]], proposed the idea of the molecular mechanism of heredity as early as in 1927 stating that inherited traits would be inherited via a \"giant hereditary molecule\" which would be made up of \"two mirror strands that would replicate in a semi-conservative fashion using each strand as a template\".

In the 20th century a number of prominent Soviet aerospace engineers, inspired by the fundamental works of Nikolai Zhukovsky and Sergei Chaplygin among others, supervised the creation of many dozens of models of military and civilian aircraft and founded a number of ''KBs'' (''Construction Bureaus'') that now constitute the bulk of Russia's [[United Aircraft Corporation]]. A number of individual inventors also made important contributions to aircraft technology, such as [[Gleb Kotelnikov]] who invented the [[knapsack]] [[parachute]], or [[Evgeniy Chertovsky]] who introduced the [[pressure suit]]. Theoretical works by [[Petr Ufimtsev]] played a critical role in development of [[stealth technology]].\n\nFamous Russian airplanes include the first [[supersonic]] passenger jet [[Tupolev Tu-144]] by [[Alexei Tupolev]], [[MiG|MiG fighter aircraft]] series by [[Artem Mikoyan]] and [[Mikhail Gurevich (aircraft designer)|Mikhail Gurevich]], and [[Sukhoi|Su]] series by [[Pavel Sukhoi]] and his followers.

Neapolitan, Piacentine, Triestine, and Sicilian cards are divided into ''Coppe'' (Cups), ''Ori'' or ''Denari'' (Golds or Coins), ''Spade'' (Swords) and ''Bastoni'' (Clubs), while Piemontesi, Milanesi and Toscane cards use the 'French' suits, that is ''Cuori'' (Hearts), ''Quadri'' (Diamonds, literally \"Squares\"), ''Fiori'' (Flowers) and ''Picche'' (Spades, literally \"Pikes\").\n\nThe values on the cards range numerically from one through seven, plus three face cards in each suit: Knave [''Fante'' in Italian] (worth a value of 8), Knight [''Cavallo'' in Italian] in the Neapolitan-type decks, Queen [''Donna'' in Italian] in the Milanese-type decks (worth 9), and King [''Re'' in Italian] (worth 10). A Knave is a lone male figure standing. The Knight is a male figure riding a horse; the Queen is a female figure. The King is a male figure wearing a crown.  To determine the face value of any numeric card, simply count the number of suit icons on the card. Since the Coins/Diamonds are important in winning some points, the cards of that suit are also nicknamed as \"bello\" (handsome): so, \"il settebello\" is the Seven of Coins/Diamonds, \"l'asso bello\" is the Ace of Coins/Diamonds.\n\n==Gameplay==\nAll players arrange themselves around the playing surface. If playing in teams, team members should be opposite each other. One player is chosen to be the dealer.\n\n[[File:Scopa 01.png|thumb|250px|left|Initial setting of the game]]\nEach player receives three cards. The dealer deals them out one card at a time, in a counter-clockwise direction, beginning with the player to their right. During this deal, the dealer will also place four cards face up on the table. A table card may be dealt before the deal begins, immediately after dealing a card to themselves but before dealing to the next player, or after dealing all players all three cards.\n\nAs it is impossible to sweep in a game where the initial table cards include three or four kings, such a deal is considered invalid. The cards are re-shuffled, and the dealer deals again.\n\nThe player to the dealer's right begins play. This player has two options:  Either place a card on the table, or play a card to capture one or more cards. A capture is made by matching a card in the player's hand to a card of the same value on the table, or if that is not possible, by matching a card in the player's hand to the sum of the values of two or more cards on the table.  In both cases, both the card from the player's hand and the captured card(s) are removed and placed face down in a pile in front of the player. These cards are now out of play until scores are calculated at the end of the round. If by capturing, all cards were removed from the table, then this is called a scopa, and an additional point is awarded at the end of the round.\n[[File:Scopa 02.png|thumb|250px|right|Opponent is capturing two cards with one card from his hand (1+3=4).]]\n\n:''Example: The player's hand contains the 2 of coins, 5 of swords, and 7 of clubs (or batons). On the table are the ace of coins, 5 of cups, and 6 of swords. The player's options are:\n\n#''Place the 2 of coins on the table;\n#''Capture the 5 of cups using the 5 of swords, and place both cards face down in front of themselves;\n#''Capture the 6 of swords and ace of coins using the 7 of clubs, and place all three cards face down in front of themselves.\n\nNote that it is not legal to place on the table a card that has the ability to capture.  For example, if a 2 and a 4 are on the table and a player holds a 6, the player must either take that trick or play a different card from their hand.\n\nIn any circumstance in which a played card may capture either a single or multiple cards, the player is forced to capture only the single card.  For example, if the cards on the table are 1, 3, 4, and 8 (Knave, or Fante in Italian), and the player plays another Knave, the player is not allowed to capture the 1, 3, and 4, even though their total does add up to 8. Instead, the player is only allowed to capture the Knave.\n\nAfter all players have played all three cards, the dealer deals out three more cards to each player, again beginning with the player to their right. That player then begins play again.  No additional cards are dealt to the table. This process is repeated until no cards remain in the deck.\n\nAfter the dealer has played the final card of the final hand of the round, the player who most recently captured is awarded any remaining cards on the table, and points are calculated for each player or team. If no team has yet won the game, the deal moves to the right. The new dealer shuffles and deals the cards as described above.\n\n==Scoring==\nPoints are awarded at the completion of each deal.  If playing in teams, the team members combine their captured cards before counting to calculate points. Players get one point for each \"scopa\".\n\nIn addition, there are up to four points available for the following, each worth 1 point apiece:\n* captured the greatest number of cards.\n* captured the greatest number of cards in the suit of coins.\n* captured the seven of coins (\"sette bello\").\n* obtained the highest \"prime\" (literally, ''primiera''), erroneously referred to as simply \"capturing the majority of sevens\".\n\nIf two or more teams or players capture the same number of cards, same number of coin cards, or the same prime value, no point is awarded for that result, e.g. if both Team 1 and Team 2 capture 20 cards total, neither gets a point for the most cards.\n\nThe \"prime\" for each team is determined by selecting the team's \"best\" card in each of the four suits, and totaling those four cards' point values. When calculating the prime, a separate point scale is used.  The player with the highest number of points using this separate point scale gets one point toward the game score.\n\nThe most common version of the separate scale is:\n\n* Seven (sette) = 21 points\n* Six (sei) = 18 points\n* Ace (asso) = 16 points\n* Five (cinque) = 15 points\n* Four (quattro) = 14 points\n* Three (tre) = 13 points\n* Two (due) = 12 points\n* Face cards = 10 points\n\nIf one team captures the sevens of cups and coins, the six of clubs and the ace of swords, that team's prime is (21 + 21 + 18 + 16) = 76.\n\nOther versions of the prime's point scale exist. Most use the same ranking of cards but have variant scores, e.g. 0 points for face cards instead of 10. A variant that is popular in America but disliked by purists is to award the prime to the person with the most sevens, or the person with the most sixes if there is a tie, down to aces, and so on.\n\nObviously, the seven of coins is the most valuable card in the deck, as it alone contributes to all the four points. A player or team can win the \"prime\" even with only one seven but other useful cards. If one player has three sevens (3x21) and no cards of the fourth suit (sum=63), their opponent can win the \"prime\" with one seven (21) and three aces (3x16), for their sum would be 69. Therefore, it is a common tactic, while playing the game, to capture aces and sixes whenever possible.\n\nLikewise, if a player is holding a six and there are an ace, a two, a four, and a five on the table, they should choose the five plus the ace, unless they have already taken the seven or the six of the suit of the ace and unless one of the two remaining cards is of the coins suit and they haven't made the point of coins yet.\n\nIn addition to the four standard points (called \"punti di mazzo\", literally \"deck's points\"), teams are awarded additional points for every \"scopa\" they took during game play.  A scopa is awarded when a team manages to sweep the table of all cards.  That is, if the table contains only a 2 and a 4, and player A plays a 6, player A is awarded a scopa. Clearing the table on the last play of the last hand of a round does not count as a scopa.\n\nThe game is played until one team has at least 11 points and has a greater total than any other team. No points, including scopa points, are awarded mid-round; they are all calculated upon completion of the round. For that reason, if the current score is 10 to 9, and the team with 10 points captures the seven of coins or a scopa, the team cannot immediately claim victory. It is still possible that the opposing team could end up with a tied or higher score once all points are calculated.\n\nIn some Italian cities before the game the players can agree to play with the \"cappotto\" variant, in that scenario if a player is winning 7 points to 0, the game can be considered over and the player does not have to reach the total of 11 points.\n\nIt is also possible to agree on a different score, usually with increments of five or ten, e.g., 16, 21 or 31 points.\n\n==Idioms==\nTraditionally, one card from a sweep is turned face up in the captured cards, to remind players while calculating points that a scopa was won, and to taunt them. Many players deal the initial table cards in a 2x2 square.\n\n==Alternative variations==\nThere are many variations of scopa.  Since there are no formal rules, it is good manners to agree with the other players on the rules that are to be used before starting a game.\n\nMany of the variations here can be combined.  For example, a common variant in the Milan area combines \"Scopone scientifico\", \"Scopa d'Assi\" and \"Napola\".\n\n===Playing with French-Suited Cards===\nWhen playing with a standard 52-card pack with [[Playing_cards#French|French]] suits, 12 cards need to be removed from the deck. Easiest for most new players is to remove the face cards, and therefore play with cards ranging numerically from one through ten. More traditional is to remove the eights, nines, and tens from the deck, which yields the 40-card \"Milanese\" deck. With the Milanese deck the Jack is 8, the Queen is 9, and the King is 10 (note that in some Neapolitan decks, the Jack is called \"Lady\" and is worth 8). Regardless of which cards are removed, the diamonds suit is used for the Italian coin suit, making capturing the most diamonds and the seven of diamonds each worth a point.\n\n===Scopa d'Assi (Asso piglia tutto)===\nIn this variation of the game, playing an Ace captures all cards currently on the table (and does not count as a scopa).\n\nDepending on other chosen variants, it can happen that an ace is already on the table when one draws an ace. Rules vary as to whether or not the player will take all the cards, but usually the player takes only the ace already on the table. This event, that every player will try to avoid, is called ''burning an ace''.\n\n===Scopone===\nThe game of '''Scopone''' is based on Scopa. In this game, which must be played in 2 teams of 2, players are dealt all nine of their cards at the start of each round. Play proceeds around the table until all players have played all of their cards.\n\nIn another form of the game, the '''scopone scientifico''', the players are dealt ten cards each so that none is left.<ref>{{cite book |last=Katz |first=Nikki |title=The Everything Card Games Book: A complete guide to over 50 games to please any crowd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzYu6eaHX2MC&pg=PT243 |date=10 September 2004 |publisher=Everything Books |isbn=1-4405-2301-0|page=243}}</ref>\n\nScopa d'Assi is mostly played in the latter variant.\n\n===Napola===\nIn this variation (also known as ''Scopone trentino''), a team capturing the ace, two, and three of coins achieves the ''Napola'' (aka Napula) and is awarded additional points equal to the highest consecutive coin they obtain, e.g. if a team captures the ace, two, three, four, and five, and eight of coins, that team is awarded 5 additional points.\n\nBecause of the higher number of points awarded per game, the game is played until one team has 21 points, rather than 11. Sometimes a team that manages to capture all 10 coins in a single round wins the game immediately.\n\n===Additional points===\nIn the Re Bello (\"Beautiful King\") version, the King of coins also counts as a point, just as does the Seven of coins.\n\nIn some regions of Calabria (especially near Cosenza), a point is awarded for the seven of cups in addition to the seven of coins.\n\n===Scopa di Quindici===\nIn this variation, the played card does not take a card or set of cards that sum to the value of the card played. Rather, it takes any set of cards including itself that add to 15. If the table is A, 3, 5, 7, playing a 2 would take itself plus the A, 5 and 7 (A + 2 + 5 + 7 = 15).\n\n===Cirulla===\nThis [[Genoa|Genoese]] variation is highly popular in Liguria and bordering zones; it is basically a mixture of traditional scopa, \"Scopa di quindici\" and \"Scopa d'assi\", plus it awards additional points for the \"Grande\" (Big One - 5 points go to the player able to take all three figure cards of coins), \"Piccola\" (Small Ones - 1 point awarded for each consecutive card of coins after the ace. It is entirely possible for a player to get the \"most coins\" point but neither the Big One nor Small One bonus due to the opponent securing vital cards in the sequence).\n\nMoreover, Cirulla players whose hand of three cards adds up to less than 9 have to put all of them down on the table and mark three points as if he scored that many \"scopa\". To the end of such calculations the seven of cups (hearts in Genoese-types) counts as \"matta\" (\"joker\"): the player decides its value. With such a high degree of point-awarding combinations and the possibility of scoring dozens of points in a single hand Cirulla games are tense affairs, where seemingly desperate situations can be reversed in a matter of minutes and where the ultimate goal can be set at 51 points.\n\n==Libyan Scopa==\nScopa is very popular in [[Libya]] and is usually played as mentioned above, but some local variations are often added: for example, a) a sweep of Diamonds (sometimes nine are enough) will reset the opponent to zero, b) players count Scopas based on the value of the winning card (if the 'winning card' is worth 7, the scopa is worth 7), and c) players count Scopa values based on the total number of cards involved (if a scopa numbers 5 cards, the number of points awarded for that scopa equals 5; if a scopa is but 2 cards, only 2 points are awarded).\n\n==Scoring the prime==\nA number of variant point systems are used for calculating the prime, most of which produce the same order of hands. One notable variant that does not produce the same order is to count 0 points for each face card.\n\n==Final score==\nSome play to 16 or 21 points, or even to an arbitrary score agreed to at the beginning of the game.\n\n==Computer versions==\nThere is a playable version of Scopa within the Nancy Drew game [[The Phantom of Venice]].\n\nThere are [[application software|apps]] for Android smartphones, and the [[Nokia internet tablet]] running the [[Maemo]] operating system, as well as for iOS iPads and iPhones.\n\n==Tunisian Shkobba==\nBrought by  Italian and Sicilian immigrants, The Tunisian Shkobba is known by a card appearance looking similar to Sicilian Cards. Shkobba is played with the same rules, the same score but played majorly with 2 players or 2 duos. Shkobba is taking a big place in [[Tunisia]], which can be seen at every caf\u00e9 and every Tunisian house, especially in [[Ramadan]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Briscola]]\n*[[Cassino (card game)|Cassino]]\n*[[Escoba]]\n*[[Mulle]]\n*[[Pasur (card game)|Pasur]]\n*[[Zwickern|Zwicker]]\n*''[[The Scientific Cardplayer]]'', a 1972 Italian film about a Scopa player\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*french wikipedia article about chkobba https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chkobba\n\n== Literature ==\n*{{cite book|author=[[Andrea Angiolino]]|author2=Beniamino Sidoti|title=Dizionario dei Giochi|publisher=Zanichelli|year=2010|location=Bologna|ISBN=978-88-08-19349-0|ref=Angiolino e Sidoti 2010 }}\n\n==External links==\n* {{pagat|Scopone and Scopa|fishing/scopone.html}}\n* [[:it:Scopone scientifico#Calcolo del punteggio|The five-point categories]] at the Italian Wikipedia {{in lang|it}}\n* [[:hu:Kaszin\u00f3 (k\u00e1rtyaj\u00e1t\u00e9k)|Kaszin\u00f3 Hungarian variant of Scopa]] at the Hungarian Wikipedia {{in lang|hu}}\n\n[[Category:Italian card games]]\n[[Category:Fishing card games]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Italian card game}}\n{{Other uses}}\n{{Infobox card game\n| title = Scopa\n| subtitle =\n| image_link =  Italian Playing Cards.jpg\n| image_caption = [[Italian playing cards]] from a deck of ''\"Bergamasche\"'' by [[Dal Negro]]\n| alt_names = Skopa\n| type = Fishing\n| players = 2, 3, 4, or 6\n| ages =\n| num_cards = 40-card\n| deck = Italian\n| play = counter-clockwise\n| card_rank = R C F 7 6 5 4 3 2 1\n| origin = Italy\n| related = [[Cassino (card game)|Cassino]], [[Escoba]], [[Skwitz]], [[Zwickern]]\n| playing_time =\n| random_chance =\n| skills =\n| footnotes =\n}}\n'''Scopa''' ({{IPA-it|\u02c8sko\u02d0pa}}; literally \"broom\") is an Italian [[card game]], and one of the two major national card games in Italy, the other being [[Briscola]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Oxford Dictionary of Card Games |first=David |last=Parlett |page=251 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-19-869173-4}}</ref> It is also popular in [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]], brought in by [[Italian diaspora|Italian immigrants]], mostly in the [[Scopa#Scopa di Quindici|Scopa di Quindici]] variation.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.jogosdecartas.com.br/defaultb.asp?area=61&id=8&nome=Escopa |title=Escopa |work=Jogos de Cartas |language=pt |year=2014 |accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> Scopa is also played in former [[Italian empire|Italian colonies]] such as [[Libya]] and [[Somalia]] or some other countries like [[Tunisia]] with changed appearance in the cards.

Watching a game of scopa can be a highly entertaining activity, since games traditionally involve lively, colorful, and somewhat strong-worded banter in between hands.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.lifeinitaly.com/potpourri/scopa-italian-card-game |title=Scopa: A Traditional Italian Card Game |work=Life in Italy |year=2014 |accessdate=30 November 2014}}</ref> However, skill and chance are more important for the outcome of the game.\n\n== History ==\nScopa was already widespread throughout Italy in the 18th century, but there is no earlier evidence of its origin.{{sfn|Angiolino e Sidoti|2010|p=935}}\n\n==Cards==\n[[File:Carte napoletane al completo.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|''\"Napoletane\"'' cards]]\nA deck of [[Italian cards]] consist of 40 cards, divided into four suits. Neapolitan, Piacentine, Triestine, and Sicilian cards are divided into ''Coppe'' (Cups), ''Ori'' or ''Denari'' (Golds or Coins), ''Spade'' (Swords) and ''Bastoni'' (Clubs), while Piemontesi, Milanesi and Toscane cards use the 'French' suits, that is ''Cuori'' (Hearts), ''Quadri'' (Diamonds, literally \"Squares\"), ''Fiori'' (Flowers) and ''Picche'' (Spades, literally \"Pikes\").\n\nThe values on the cards range numerically from one through seven, plus three face cards in each suit: Knave [''Fante'' in Italian] (worth a value of 8), Knight [''Cavallo'' in Italian] in the Neapolitan-type decks, Queen [''Donna'' in Italian] in the Milanese-type decks (worth 9), and King [''Re'' in Italian] (worth 10). A Knave is a lone male figure standing. The Knight is a male figure riding a horse; the Queen is a female figure. The King is a male figure wearing a crown.  To determine the face value of any numeric card, simply count the number of suit icons on the card. Since the Coins/Diamonds are important in winning some points, the cards of that suit are also nicknamed as \"bello\" (handsome): so, \"il settebello\" is the Seven of Coins/Diamonds, \"l'asso bello\" is the Ace of Coins/Diamonds.\n\n==Gameplay==\nAll players arrange themselves around the playing surface. If playing in teams, team members should be opposite each other. One player is chosen to be the dealer.\n\n[[File:Scopa 01.png|thumb|250px|left|Initial setting of the game]]\nEach player receives three cards. The dealer deals them out one card at a time, in a counter-clockwise direction, beginning with the player to their right. During this deal, the dealer will also place four cards face up on the table. A table card may be dealt before the deal begins, immediately after dealing a card to themselves but before dealing to the next player, or after dealing all players all three cards.\n\nAs it is impossible to sweep in a game where the initial table cards include three or four kings, such a deal is considered invalid. The cards are re-shuffled, and the dealer deals again.\n\nThe player to the dealer's right begins play. This player has two options:  Either place a card on the table, or play a card to capture one or more cards. A capture is made by matching a card in the player's hand to a card of the same value on the table, or if that is not possible, by matching a card in the player's hand to the sum of the values of two or more cards on the table.  In both cases, both the card from the player's hand and the captured card(s) are removed and placed face down in a pile in front of the player. These cards are now out of play until scores are calculated at the end of the round. If by capturing, all cards were removed from the table, then this is called a scopa, and an additional point is awarded at the end of the round.\n[[File:Scopa 02.png|thumb|250px|right|Opponent is capturing two cards with one card from his hand (1+3=4).]]\n\n:''Example: The player's hand contains the 2 of coins, 5 of swords, and 7 of clubs (or batons). On the table are the ace of coins, 5 of cups, and 6 of swords. The player's options are:\n\n#''Place the 2 of coins on the table;\n#''Capture the 5 of cups using the 5 of swords, and place both cards face down in front of themselves;\n#''Capture the 6 of swords and ace of coins using the 7 of clubs, and place all three cards face down in front of themselves.\n\nNote that it is not legal to place on the table a card that has the ability to capture.  For example, if a 2 and a 4 are on the table and a player holds a 6, the player must either take that trick or play a different card from their hand.\n\nIn any circumstance in which a played card may capture either a single or multiple cards, the player is forced to capture only the single card.  For example, if the cards on the table are 1, 3, 4, and 8 (Knave, or Fante in Italian), and the player plays another Knave, the player is not allowed to capture the 1, 3, and 4, even though their total does add up to 8. Instead, the player is only allowed to capture the Knave.\n\nAfter all players have played all three cards, the dealer deals out three more cards to each player, again beginning with the player to their right. That player then begins play again.  No additional cards are dealt to the table. This process is repeated until no cards remain in the deck.\n\nAfter the dealer has played the final card of the final hand of the round, the player who most recently captured is awarded any remaining cards on the table, and points are calculated for each player or team. If no team has yet won the game, the deal moves to the right. The new dealer shuffles and deals the cards as described above.\n\n==Scoring==\nPoints are awarded at the completion of each deal.  If playing in teams, the team members combine their captured cards before counting to calculate points. Players get one point for each \"scopa\".\n\nIn addition, there are up to four points available for the following, each worth 1 point apiece:\n* captured the greatest number of cards.\n* captured the greatest number of cards in the suit of coins.\n* captured the seven of coins (\"sette bello\").\n* obtained the highest \"prime\" (literally, ''primiera''), erroneously referred to as simply \"capturing the majority of sevens\".\n\nIf two or more teams or players capture the same number of cards, same number of coin cards, or the same prime value, no point is awarded for that result, e.g. if both Team 1 and Team 2 capture 20 cards total, neither gets a point for the most cards.\n\nThe \"prime\" for each team is determined by selecting the team's \"best\" card in each of the four suits, and totaling those four cards' point values. When calculating the prime, a separate point scale is used.  The player with the highest number of points using this separate point scale gets one point toward the game score.\n\nThe most common version of the separate scale is:\n\n* Seven (sette) = 21 points\n* Six (sei) = 18 points\n* Ace (asso) = 16 points\n* Five (cinque) = 15 points\n* Four (quattro) = 14 points\n* Three (tre) = 13 points\n* Two (due) = 12 points\n* Face cards = 10 points\n\nIf one team captures the sevens of cups and coins, the six of clubs and the ace of swords, that team's prime is (21 + 21 + 18 + 16) = 76.\n\nOther versions of the prime's point scale exist. Most use the same ranking of cards but have variant scores, e.g. 0 points for face cards instead of 10. A variant that is popular in America but disliked by purists is to award the prime to the person with the most sevens, or the person with the most sixes if there is a tie, down to aces, and so on.\n\nObviously, the seven of coins is the most valuable card in the deck, as it alone contributes to all the four points. A player or team can win the \"prime\" even with only one seven but other useful cards. If one player has three sevens (3x21) and no cards of the fourth suit (sum=63), their opponent can win the \"prime\" with one seven (21) and three aces (3x16), for their sum would be 69. Therefore, it is a common tactic, while playing the game, to capture aces and sixes whenever possible.\n\nLikewise, if a player is holding a six and there are an ace, a two, a four, and a five on the table, they should choose the five plus the ace, unless they have already taken the seven or the six of the suit of the ace and unless one of the two remaining cards is of the coins suit and they haven't made the point of coins yet.\n\nIn addition to the four standard points (called \"punti di mazzo\", literally \"deck's points\"), teams are awarded additional points for every \"scopa\" they took during game play.  A scopa is awarded when a team manages to sweep the table of all cards.  That is, if the table contains only a 2 and a 4, and player A plays a 6, player A is awarded a scopa. Clearing the table on the last play of the last hand of a round does not count as a scopa.\n\nThe game is played until one team has at least 11 points and has a greater total than any other team.

It is still possible that the opposing team could end up with a tied or higher score once all points are calculated.\n\nIn some Italian cities before the game the players can agree to play with the \"cappotto\" variant, in that scenario if a player is winning 7 points to 0, the game can be considered over and the player does not have to reach the total of 11 points.\n\nIt is also possible to agree on a different score, usually with increments of five or ten, e.g., 16, 21 or 31 points.\n\n==Idioms==\nTraditionally, one card from a sweep is turned face up in the captured cards, to remind players while calculating points that a scopa was won, and to taunt them.

Bush]] was the catalyst for his political intrigue, this link between political thought and music became much more evident upon the 2018 release of The Voidz\u2019 album, ''Virtue,'' through which he more explicitly expresses politically-charged ideas.<ref name=\":3\" /> Doing so, Casablancas explains, is using his music as a \u201cmeans to an end to make the world a better place.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> The music industry, according to Casablancas, operates quite similarly to the political world, where \u201cwhoever\u2019s propaganda\u2019s the loudest\u201d is what is popular, regardless of its quality.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2016 Casablancas interviewed [[Henry Giroux]], during which they discuss the idea of whether or not the average American identifies that there are

most concerned with the idea that institutions have become more powerful than democratic government.<ref name=\":3\" /> He proposes that there is a perpetual conflict between those who understand that

Bush]] was the catalyst for his political intrigue, this link between political thought and music became much more evident upon the 2018 release of The Voidz\u2019 album, ''Virtue,'' through which he more explicitly expresses politically-charged ideas.<ref name=\":3\" /> Doing so, Casablancas explains, is using his music as a \u201cmeans to an end to make the world a better place.\u201d<ref name=\":3\" /> The music industry, according to Casablancas, operates quite similarly to the political world, where \u201cwhoever\u2019s propaganda\u2019s the loudest\u201d is what is popular, regardless of its quality.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nIn 2016 Casablancas interviewed [[Henry Giroux]], during which they discuss the idea of whether or not the average American identifies that there are still existing struggles and conflicts that need to be addressed within the country.<ref>{{Citation|last=Rolling Stone|title=Julian Casablancas Interviews Henry Giroux|date=2016-09-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLRWPsIzSOo&list=RD94hM2wkA1mw&index=3|access-date=2018-11-15}}</ref> Amongst various other issues impending on society today, Casablancas is most concerned with the idea that institutions have become more powerful than democratic government.<ref name=\":3\" /> He proposes that there is a perpetual conflict between those who understand that the democratic nature of the U.S. is lost and those who seek to keep it that way.<ref name=\":3\" /> It is in this way that the music industry reflects the nature of politics- quality and integrity is compromised under the control of capitalist greed.\n\nCasablancas cites some of his most politically influential figures as [[Oliver Stone]], [[Chris Hedges]], [[Jesse Ventura]], and [[Howard Zinn]].<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":3\" /> He notes [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] as his favorite philosopher, whose work, Casablancas claims, held truth as an important standard value.<ref name=\":3\" /> He recognizes [[Paul Robeson]] as someone who used his musical platform to help further his serious political intrigue and as someone who, therefore, serves as a role model for politically engaged musicians.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nCasablancas has been a guest on ''[[Redacted Tonight]]'', as well as included its host, Lee Camp, as an opener for a Voidz show in Houston, Texas in October 2018.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nCasablancas endorsed Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] for the [[2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], and performed with his band at a rally in the [[University of New Hampshire]] the night before the New Hampshire primary.<ref> {{url=https://consequenceofsound.net/2020/01/the-strokes-bernie-sanders-rally-in-new-hampshire/}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy

In the drawing, 14 balls numbered 1\u201314 are placed in a lottery machine and mixed. Four balls are drawn to determine a four-digit combination (only 11\u201312\u201313\u201314 is ignored & redrawn). The team assigned that four-ball combination receives the No. 1 pick.  The four balls are then placed back into the machine and the process is repeated to determine the second pick. The two teams whose numerical combinations do not come up in the lottery will select in the inverse order of their two-year cumulative record.

A separate notification timetable is provided for players involved in postseason tournaments (most notably the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Division I tournament]]); those players must declare for the draft within 24 hours of their final game.

A separate notification timetable is provided for players involved in postseason tournaments (most notably the [[NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Division I tournament]]); those players must declare for the draft within 24 hours of their final game.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

It stars [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Judy Greer]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]].\n\n''Where'd You Go, Bernadette'' was released on August 16, 2019, by [[Annapurna Pictures]] through their [[United Artists Releasing]] joint venture. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nArchitect-turned-recluse Bernadette Fox ([[Cate Blanchett]]) is settled down with her husband Elgin ([[Billy Crudup]]) and their daughter Bee ([[Emma Nelson]]) in a dilapidated former schoolhouse in [[Seattle]]. Bernadette hates people, hates leaving the house, hates Seattle, and more than anything, she hates the other parents at her 15-year-old daughter Bee's school. This includes her neighbor Audrey Griffin ([[Kristen Wiig]]).\n\nDespite her misanthropic behavior, Bernadette is exceptionally close to Bee and reluctantly agrees to go on a family vacation to [[Antarctica]] at Bee's request. Bernadette starts to behave oddly, concerning everyone. She uses a cocktail of prescription drugs to control her anxiety and insomnia, which grows worse as the Antarctica trip nears. Her feud with Audrey grows more intense; at one point she runs over Audrey's foot while speeding off in her car. Later on, the hillside above Audrey's home which Bernadette had cleared of invasive blackberries subsides into Audrey's garden and house during heavy rain. Although she insists that she was only complying with Audrey's request, Elgin accuses architect Bernadette of knowing that the hill would collapse without the blackberries to hold it in place.\n\nBernadette has a personal assistant named Manjula in India with whom she regularly communicates. One day, she finds Elgin, Dr. Kurtz ([[Judy Greer]]), and an FBI agent at her home for an intervention. They tell her that Manjula is a front for a Russian criminal operation which has Bernadette\u2019s personal information and is planning to defraud her family. Elgin wants Bernadette to go with Dr. Kurtz to a mental hospital to seek treatment, which horrifies her. She sneaks out of the house and finds refuge with Audrey, whom she makes amends with. With Audrey's help, Bernadette flies to Antarctica. Elgin and Bee follow in hot pursuit, after the FBI agent tells them that the Russian criminal has been arrested and is no longer a threat.\n\nIn Antarctica, Bernadette befriends a scientist and learns that the research station at the South Pole is going to be completely rebuilt and will need an architect. She smuggles herself off her cruise ship and onto a research station, where she convinces the team leader ([[Kate Burton (actress)|Kate Burton]]), to give her a spot on a shuttle to the South Pole. Meanwhile, Elgin comes to the realization that he has failed his wife in not supporting her. He and Bee catch up with her at the station, and realizing that her passion and creativity have been reignited, give their permission to her to make the 5-week journey.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Bernadette Fox\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Elgin Branch\n* Emma Nelson as Bee Branch\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Audrey Griffin\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as Marcus Strang\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Dr. Janelle Kurtz\n* [[Troian Bellisario]] as Becky\n* [[Zo\u00eb Chao]] as Soo-Lin Lee-Segal\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Paul Jellinek\n* [[Claudia Doumit]] as Iris\n* Katelyn Statton as Vivian\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as David Walker\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Judy Toll\n* Richard Robichaux as Floyd the pharmacist\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Captain J.

It stars [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Billy Crudup]], [[Kristen Wiig]], [[Judy Greer]], and [[Laurence Fishburne]].\n\n''Where'd You Go, Bernadette'' was released on August 16, 2019, by [[Annapurna Pictures]] through their [[United Artists Releasing]] joint venture. It received mixed reviews from critics.\n\n==Plot==\nArchitect-turned-recluse Bernadette Fox ([[Cate Blanchett]]) is settled down with her husband Elgin ([[Billy Crudup]]) and their daughter Bee ([[Emma Nelson]]) in a dilapidated former schoolhouse in [[Seattle]]. Bernadette hates people, hates leaving the house, hates Seattle, and more than anything, she hates the other parents at her 15-year-old daughter Bee's school. This includes her neighbor Audrey Griffin ([[Kristen Wiig]]).\n\nDespite her misanthropic behavior, Bernadette is exceptionally close to Bee and reluctantly agrees to go on a family vacation to [[Antarctica]] at Bee's request. Bernadette starts to behave oddly, concerning everyone. She uses a cocktail of prescription drugs to control her anxiety and insomnia, which grows worse as the Antarctica trip nears. Her feud with Audrey grows more intense; at one point she runs over Audrey's foot while speeding off in her car. Later on, the hillside above Audrey's home which Bernadette had cleared of invasive blackberries subsides into Audrey's garden and house during heavy rain. Although she insists that she was only complying with Audrey's request, Elgin accuses architect Bernadette of knowing that the hill would collapse without the blackberries to hold it in place.\n\nBernadette has a personal assistant named Manjula in India with whom she regularly communicates. One day, she finds Elgin, Dr. Kurtz ([[Judy Greer]]), and an FBI agent at her home for an intervention. They tell her that Manjula is a front for a Russian criminal operation which has Bernadette\u2019s personal information and is planning to defraud her family. Elgin wants Bernadette to go with Dr. Kurtz to a mental hospital to seek treatment, which horrifies her. She sneaks out of the house and finds refuge with Audrey, whom she makes amends with. With Audrey's help, Bernadette flies to Antarctica. Elgin and Bee follow in hot pursuit, after the FBI agent tells them that the Russian criminal has been arrested and is no longer a threat.\n\nIn Antarctica, Bernadette befriends a scientist and learns that the research station at the South Pole is going to be completely rebuilt and will need an architect. She smuggles herself off her cruise ship and onto a research station, where she convinces the team leader ([[Kate Burton]]), to give her a spot on a shuttle to the South Pole. Meanwhile, Elgin comes to the realization that he has failed his wife in not supporting her. He and Bee catch up with her at the station, and realizing that her passion and creativity have been reignited, give their permission to her to make the 5-week journey.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Cate Blanchett]] as Bernadette Fox\n* [[Billy Crudup]] as Elgin Branch\n* Emma Nelson as Bee Branch\n* [[Kristen Wiig]] as Audrey Griffin\n* [[James Urbaniak]] as Marcus Strang\n* [[Judy Greer]] as Dr. Janelle Kurtz\n* [[Troian Bellisario]] as Becky\n* [[Zo\u00eb Chao]] as Soo-Lin Lee-Segal\n* [[Laurence Fishburne]] as Paul Jellinek\n* [[Claudia Doumit]] as Iris\n* Katelyn Statton as Vivian\n* [[Steve Zahn]] as David Walker\n* [[Megan Mullally]] as Judy Toll\n* Richard Robichaux as Floyd the pharmacist\n* [[J\u00f3hannes Haukur J\u00f3hannesson]] as Captain J.
