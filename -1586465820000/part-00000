Some of the prominent private schools are the [[Saraswati Shishu Mandir|Saraswati Sishu Mandir]], Sri Arabinda Purnanga Sikhya Kendra, Priyadarshini Convent School, Sri Satya Sai School. The town also has a [[Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya]] and a [[Kendriya Vidyalaya]] set-up by the ministry of HRD, Central Union Government.\n[[File:SKCG College6.jpeg|alt=SKCG|thumb|249x249px|SKCG College Entrance]]\n\n== Civic administration ==\nThe Paralakhemundi Municipality is in charge of the civic administration of the town. As the headquarters of the Gajapati district, it houses several district-level headquarters of government and private organizations.\n\n== Economy ==\nParalakhemundi is situated among the [[Eastern Ghats]] where there are vast plains and number of small streams and rivers. This has enabled cultivation as the chief source of income here. People cultivate mainly paddy, which is grown twice-a-year in the fields, once during Kharif and once during Rabi seasons. However many farmers also cultivate cash crops like Sugar Cane, Maize and Smoking Leaves. Some even cultivate long term cash crops like Mango Plantation, Cashew, Banana etc. The latest trend is that farmers are getting inclined to grow cotton in their fields, which apparently is more profitable to them. Apart from Cultivation and Industries related to cultivation like Rice Mills, Mango Pulp Factories, Cashew Factories, Rice Flake Industries, Sugar Mill, the town is poorly industrialized. However, some medium scale granite factories have been set-up in the surroundings of the town.The other source of income of the residents is through the Handicrafts that are made by them, which they are learning traditionally from generation to generation. The economy is sustainable but is not flourishing due to lack of industrialization and exposure to bigger markets.\n\n== Transport ==\nParalakhemundi is connected to other parts of Odisha by the State Highway 4 (SH-4) which connects Berhampur at one end and Rayagada on the other. The [[National Highway 326A (India)|National Highway 326A]] passes through the village, which connects [[Mohana]] in [[Odisha]] with [[Narasannapeta]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite web|title=List of National Highways passing through A.P.

The princely rulers had the penchant of promoting and sponsoring the artists. Sri Gopal Krushna Patnaik (1785\u20131862), an eminent Odia Poet of the eighteenth century was born in Parlakhemundi. He was contemporary of Kavisurya Baladev Rath. He was a lyric-poet. His writings on the Krishna Leela like, \u2018Brajaku Chora Asichhi\u2019, \u2018Uthilu Ede Begi Kahinkire\u2019, \u2018Mo Krushna Chandrama\u2019, \u2018Dukhidhana Chandranana\u2019 etc. lyrical poems were depicting the expression of affection.\n\nParalakhemundi is home to many forms of art and craft work.\n[[File:Horn craft.jpg|alt=Horn Work|thumb|251x251px|Horn Work of Paralakhemundi]]\n[[File:Gajapati Palace7.jpeg|alt=Lion|thumb|250x250px|The Guarding Lion]]\nHorn-work is the oldest craft of Paralakhemundi. The artisans of this art are called Maharanas. These artisans are said to have migrated from a place called Pitala in Ganjam district under the patronage of the Maharaja of Gajapati, Krishna Chandra Deb. The hornwork items include figurines, birds, animals and scenes from Indian mythology. The Palace Street is famous for its horn-work showrooms. The horn-works of Paralakhemundi were one of the important products of cottage industry. The horn-works of Paralakhemundi got a special place among the other craft works of [[Calcutta]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Kakinada]] and [[Trivandrum]]. The horn-works were made chiefly out of the horns of cattle which were supplied from the neighboring maliahs of the zamindari. The artists of Paralakhemundi first of all used to prepare birds from the horns. Gradually they prepared combs, elephants, horses, prawns, idols of Lord Jagannatha etc. The craft items are then sent to cities and art emporiums. The Horn-work artisans also have a Cooperative society that looks after the promotion and sales of their art work. These horn works are also highly popular in the international market.\n\nThe other Craft that was famous in the yester years was the Ivory-work. The artists of Paralakhemundi used to carve out beautiful works like throne, khatuli (cot) etc. out of ivory and bone. Forests in which a large number of elephants lived surrounded Paralakhemundi. Hence, ivory was plentifully available in Paralakhemundi. Sri. Radha Krushna Maharana and his son Sri. Purnachandra Maharana, Surendra Maharana and Bhaskara Maharana were experts in the field of ivory works during the British period.\n\nParalakhemundi is also known for crafts like the Jaikhadi bag, cane and bamboo work. The Chitrakar Sahi (Artist's Street) is famous for its clay, stone sculptures and water paintings. The chitrakar or painters could do wonders with their paint work. Some of the paint works include the Sculptures of Idols, Wall Painting, Fabric Painting, Painted Playing Cards, Paper Masks, Embossed Paper Idols and Souvenirs. Due to fading demand and economic considerations, now only a few artists are seen to practice the family tradition.\n[[File:Paralakhemundi Rath Yatra.jpeg|alt=Jagannath|thumb|251x251px|Paralakhemundi Rath Yatra]]\nThe town celebrates almost all festivities, all round the year. The Jagannath Ratha Yatra being the most revered one. The Jagannath Rath Yatra of Paralakhemundi is second only to the famous Puri festival. The three Idols of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balbhadra and Lord Subhadra are quite huge in size and are adorable. The Yatra or Car Festival, was patronized by the Gajapati kings. In the initial years the car festival would follow the traditions of puri and had three separate cars or rathas. However it became one car till 2012. In that year the concept of three cars was again implemented and since then, the three idols enjoy the festivities for nine days on their own cars.The believers throng the Jagannath Temple everyday and its worth watching the bhajan following the evening aarati/ceremonial rituals.\n[[File:Mahendra Tanaya River6.jpeg|alt=Paralakhemundi|thumb|252x252px|Mahendra Tanaya River]]\n[[Vijayadashami|Dasahara]], [[Raksha Bandhan|Gamhapurnima/Raksha Bandhan]], [[Holi]], Gajalakshmi Puja, [[Ganesh Chaturthi|Ganesh Puja]], [[Kali Puja]], Makar [[Sankranti|Sankranthi]] and Thakurani Yatra are major Hindu festivals observed in the town. [[Christmas]] and Ramzan are also celebrated very beautifully in the town. Traditionally the Thakurani yatra is conducted periodically for the local area Goddess (Grama Devi), a ritual that continues for about a week. During the Thakurani Yatra, the residents make caricatures, children participate in fancy dresses to make fun and to spread awareness regarding current issues. During evening, cultural programs like drama, orchestra and Bhuta Keli (dramatised romance of Lord Krishna and his Consort Radha maa) are staged. Gaja Muhaan is one more local traditional festivity. This is celebrated after the harvest season is over. The fresh paddy is converted into rice flakes, which are then made into a conical shape by using jaggery as the binding material. Huge cones of the rice flakes are prepared and are offered to the local resident Goddess. The Rice Flake Cone (Gaja Muhaan) is then taken out for procession around the city with orchestra and band. The believers carry these huge rice flake cones on their heads and dance to the tunes of the band to appease the Goddess. The scene is to be seen to be believed.\n\nBeing part of the erstwhile Jamindari, the tradition of learning martial art through rituals is another salient feature of this town. The paikas or the erstwhile fighter community still practice the Indian Martial Art forms like the Cane Game (Badi Khela), Sword Playing Tricks, Knife Playing Tricks, Playing with fire ball and lots more. The paikas perform these arts during the Dushera after the Ayudha Puja (worshiping of the Armour) which enthralls the audience and reminds everyone about the traditions of the past.\n\nFamous for its rich heritage and love for art, the town has an art school where children are trained in Odishi Dance and Odishi Sangeet (Songs). The Bhakti Sangeet group encourages young artists to sing and spreads the culture of harmony and togetherness through the devotional songs.\n\n== Sports ==\nCricket is the major sport of the town. Volleyball, basketball, hockey being the other popular sports in the town. Little boys and girls can still be seen playing silly in the evening. The town has a small stadium named Gajapati Stadium. College ground is also a preferable venue for cricket, football matches. There are several other large play grounds that host some district and state level sport events. Cricket being the major game, it is played almost in every street. There are many cricket clubs and small organizers who organize multi team cricket tournaments mainly during winter. Also, a tennis court adds to the sports facilities of the town.\n\n==Heritage and tourism==\n[[File:Ram Sagar.jpeg|alt=Ram Sagar|thumb|252x252px|Ram Sagar of Paralakhemundi]]\n[[File:Brundavan Palace.jpeg|alt=BN Palace|thumb|252x252px|Brundavan Palace or Basant Nivas Palace]]\n[[File:Mahendra Tanaya River5.jpeg|alt=Paralakhemundi|thumb|252x252px|Mahendra Tanaya River]]\nThe small and historic town has many heritage places and places for tourist attraction.

During the regime of these kings, the boundaries of the dynasty was extended from the Ganges in the North to Udayagiri, Nellore district in the South. Kolahomee, one of the sons of Gajapati Kapilendra Dev, the Gajapati monarch in the later half of the 15th Century came to this part of Paralakhemundi (then in Ganjam district) and founded the Royal family of Paralakhemundi.\n\nGajapati district has been named after Maharaja Sri Krushna Chandra Gajapati Narayan Dev, the Raja Sahib of Paralakhemundi estate.

The institute has been rechristened as [[Centurion University of Technology and Management]] (CUTM) recently. Students from all over Odisha and neighbouring states like Andhra Pradesh, Bihar and Jharkhand are studying in this institute, which provides Engineering and Management degrees in several disciplines.\n\nSanskrit college is one of the oldest colleges in Paralakhemundi.

Several other private-public partnered colleges have come up recently in the town and in the periphery of the town. MBA Degree College, Law College, Nursing College, Sri Ram College Kasinagar are a few of them.\n[[File:SKCG College5.jpeg|alt=SKCG|thumb|249x249px|SKCG College]]\nThere are several primary, upper primary and high schools in the town.

As the headquarters of the Gajapati district, it houses several district-level headquarters of government and private organizations.\n\n== Economy ==\nParalakhemundi is situated among the [[Eastern Ghats]] where there are vast plains and number of small streams and rivers. This has enabled cultivation as the chief source of income here. People cultivate mainly paddy, which is grown twice-a-year in the fields, once during Kharif and once during Rabi seasons. However many farmers also cultivate cash crops like Sugar Cane, Maize and Smoking Leaves. Some even cultivate long term cash crops like Mango Plantation, Cashew, Banana etc. The latest trend is that farmers are getting inclined to grow cotton in their fields, which apparently is more profitable to them. Apart from Cultivation and Industries related to cultivation like Rice Mills, Mango Pulp Factories, Cashew Factories, Rice Flake Industries, Sugar Mill, the town is poorly industrialized. However, some medium scale granite factories have been set-up in the surroundings of the town.The other source of income of the residents is through the Handicrafts that are made by them, which they are learning traditionally from generation to generation. The economy is sustainable but is not flourishing due to lack of industrialization and exposure to bigger markets.\n\n== Transport ==\nParalakhemundi is connected to other parts of Odisha by the State Highway 4 (SH-4) which connects Berhampur at one end and Rayagada on the other. The [[National Highway 326A (India)|National Highway 326A]] passes though the village, which connects [[Mohana]] in [[Odisha]] with [[Narasannapeta]] of [[Andhra Pradesh]].<ref>{{cite web|title=List of National Highways passing through A.P.

The princely rulers had the penchant of promoting and sponsoring the artists. Sri Gopal Krushna Patnaik (1785\u20131862), an eminent Odia Poet of the eighteenth century was born in Parlakhemundi. He was contemporary of Kavisurya Baladev Rath. He was a lyric-poet. His writings on the Krishna Leela like, \u2018Brajaku Chora Asichhi\u2019, \u2018Uthilu Ede Begi Kahinkire\u2019, \u2018Mo Krushna Chandrama\u2019, \u2018Dukhidhana Chandranana\u2019 etc. lyrical poems were depicting the expression of affection.\n\nParalakhemundi is home to many forms of art and craft work.\n[[File:Horn craft.jpg|alt=Horn Work|thumb|251x251px|Horn Work of Paralakhemundi]]\n[[File:Gajapati Palace7.jpeg|alt=Lion|thumb|250x250px|The Guarding Lion]]\nHorn-work is the oldest craft of Paralakhemundi. The artisans of this art are called Maharanas. These artisans are said to have migrated from a place called Pitala in Ganjam district under the patronage of the Maharaja of Gajapati, Krishna Chandra Deb. The hornwork items include figurines, birds, animals and scenes from Indian mythology. The Palace Street is famous for its horn-work showrooms. The horn-works of Paralakhemundi were one of the important products of cottage industry. The horn-works of Paralakhemundi got a special place among the other craft works of [[Calcutta]], [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Kakinada]] and [[Trivandrum]]. The horn-works were made chiefly out of the horns of cattle which were supplied from the neighboring maliahs of the zamindari. The artists of Paralakhemundi first of all used to prepare birds from the horns. Gradually they prepared combs, elephants, horses, prawns, idols of Lord Jagannatha etc. The craft items are then sent to cities and art emporiums. The Horn-work artisans also have a Cooperative society that looks after the promotion and sales of their art work. These horn works are also highly popular in the international market.\n\nThe other Craft that was famous in the yester years was the Ivory-work. The artists of Paralakhemundi used to carve out beautiful works like throne, khatuli (cot) etc. out of ivory and bone. Forests in which a large number of elephants lived surrounded Paralakhemundi. Hence, ivory was plentifully available in Paralakhemundi. Sri. Radha Krushna Maharana and his son Sri. Purnachandra Maharana, Surendra Maharana and Bhaskara Maharana were experts in the field of ivory works during the British period.\n\nParalakhemundi is also known for crafts like the Jaikhadi bag, cane and bamboo work. The Chitrakar Sahi (Artist's Street) is famous for its clay, stone sculptures and water paintings. The chitrakar or painters could do wonders with their paint work. Some of the paint works include the Sculptures of Idols, Wall Painting, Fabric Painting, Painted Playing Cards, Paper Masks, Embossed Paper Idols and Souvenirs. Due to fading demand and economic considerations, now only a few artists are seen to practice the family tradition.\n[[File:Paralakhemundi Rath Yatra.jpeg|alt=Jagannath|thumb|251x251px|Paralakhemundi Rath Yatra]]\nThe town celebrates almost all festivities, all round the year. The Jagannath Ratha Yatra being the most revered one. The Jagannath Rath Yatra of Paralakhemundi is second only to the famous Puri festival. The three Idols of Lord Jagannath, Lord Balbhadra and Lord Subhadra are quite huge in size and are adorable. The Yatra or Car Festival, was patronized by the Gajapati kings. In the initial years the car festival would follow the traditions of puri and had three separate cars or rathas. However it became one car till 2012. In that year the concept of three cars was again implemented and since then, the three idols enjoy the festivities for nine days on their own cars.The believers throng the Jagannath Temple everyday and its worth watching the bhajan following the evening aarati/ceremonial rituals.\n[[File:Mahendra Tanaya River6.jpeg|alt=Paralakhemundi|thumb|252x252px|Mahendra Tanaya River]]\n[[Vijayadashami|Dasahara]], [[Raksha Bandhan|Gamhapurnima/Raksha Bandhan]], [[Holi]], Gajalakshmi Puja, [[Ganesh Chaturthi|Ganesh Puja]], [[Kali Puja]], Makar [[Sankranti|Sankranthi]] and Thakurani Yatra are major Hindu festivals observed in the town. [[Christmas]] and Ramzan are also celebrated very beautifully in the town. Traditionally the Thakurani yatra is conducted periodically for the local area Goddess (Grama Devi), a ritual that continues for about a week. During the Thakurani Yatra, the residents make caricatures, children participate in fancy dresses to make fun and to spread awareness regarding current issues. During evening, cultural programs like drama, orchestra and Bhuta Keli (dramatised romance of Lord Krishna and his Consort Radha maa) are staged. Gaja Muhaan is one more local traditional festivity. This is celebrated after the harvest season is over. The fresh paddy is converted into rice flakes, which are then made into a conical shape by using jaggery as the binding material. Huge cones of the rice flakes are prepared and are offered to the local resident Goddess. The Rice Flake Cone (Gaja Muhaan) is then taken out for procession around the city with orchestra and band. The believers carry these huge rice flake cones on their heads and dance to the tunes of the band to appease the Goddess. The scene is to be seen to be believed.\n\nBeing part of the erstwhile Jamindari, the tradition of learning martial art through rituals is another salient feature of this town. The paikas or the erstwhile fighter community still practice the Indian Martial Art forms like the Cane Game (Badi Khela), Sword Playing Tricks, Knife Playing Tricks, Playing with fire ball and lots more. The paikas perform these arts during the Dushera after the Ayudha Puja (worshiping of the Armour) which enthralls the audience and reminds everyone about the traditions of the past.\n\nFamous for its rich heritage and love for art, the town has an art school where children are trained in Odishi Dance and Odishi Sangeet (Songs). The Bhakti Sangeet group encourages young artists to sing and spreads the culture of harmony and togetherness through the devotional songs.\n\n== Sports ==\nCricket is the major sport of the town. Volleyball, basketball, hockey being the other popular sports in the town. Little boys and girls can still be seen playing silly in the evening. The town has a small stadium named Gajapati Stadium. College ground is also a preferable venue for cricket, football matches. There are several other large play grounds that host some district and state level sport events. Cricket being the major game, it is played almost in every street. There are many cricket clubs and small organizers who organize multi team cricket tournaments mainly during winter. Also, a tennis court adds to the sports facilities of the town.\n\n==Heritage and tourism==\n[[File:Ram Sagar.jpeg|alt=Ram Sagar|thumb|252x252px|Ram Sagar of Paralakhemundi]]\n[[File:Brundavan Palace.jpeg|alt=BN Palace|thumb|252x252px|Brundavan Palace or Basant Nivas Palace]]\n[[File:Mahendra Tanaya River5.jpeg|alt=Paralakhemundi|thumb|252x252px|Mahendra Tanaya River]]\nThe small and historic town has many heritage places and places for tourist attraction.

He played only three [[Test cricket|Tests]] for [[English cricket team|England]], with decidedly mixed success, but found a niche in [[One Day International]]s, where he gained much praise for his performances.\n\nHe spent most of his career at [[Essex County Cricket Club]], latterly as [[captain (cricket)|captain]], after starting at [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]]. He is of [[Irani (India)|Irani]] descent, the Iranis being a community of [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Zoroastrian]]s who immigrated to India during the [[British Raj]].\n\nIrani was a genuine [[all-rounder]] until a knee injury in 2003 forced him to stop bowling and play as a specialist batsman. The recurring nature of this injury led to Irani being forced to retire from [[first-class cricket]] in June 2007. At Essex, Irani helped bring through promising players such as [[Alastair Cook]] (England Captain) and [[Ravinder Bopara]] (England Player) as well as winning two major One-Day Titles. Professionally he scored over 20,000 runs and took more than 650 wickets during his career.\n\nHe announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the end of the 2007 season.\n\n==Personal life==\nIrani's father Jimmy Irani arrived in Bolton from Bombay in 1961 to play a summer's club cricket. During that summer he met 16-year-old Lancastrian Anne Main. The two married and had a son, Ronnie. Jimmy Irani was an enthusiastic, successful and prolific club cricketer with Daisy Hill in the Bolton Association who often put up overseas players, such as [[Farokh Engineer]] and [[Javed Miandad]], during Ronnie's childhood.<ref name=\"Irani 2010\"/>\n\n==Domestic career==\n[[Image:Irani and Bopara.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Irani batting against [[Cambridge UCCE]], April 2005]]\nHe started his career playing for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in 1990, before he moved to [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/2/2357/all_teams.html |title=Teams Ronnie Irani played for |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> At Essex, he gained [[Cult following|cult status]],<ref name=\"ciprof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/15403.html |title=Player Profile: Ronnie Irani |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref>  before he became [[Captain (cricket)|captain]] in 2000,<ref name=\"caprof\">{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/2/2357/2357.html |title=Player Profile: Ronnie Irani |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> and is generally accepted to have done a decent job in charge, helping to bring through promising players such as [[Alastair Cook]], [[Will Jefferson]] and [[Ravi Bopara]]. After [[Graham Gooch]] stepped down as the club's head coach prior to the start of the 2005 season, Irani assumed some of these responsibilities in addition to his role as county captain.<ref name=\"ciprof\"/>\n\nIn June 2007, he rejected a new contract with [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] and announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the end of the 2007 season.

He scored 169 runs and took 8 wickets in the tri-series.\n\n==After retirement==\nAfter his retirement, he took on a position at [[talkSPORT]] in 2007, where he co-hosted, until 2013, ''The Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast'' with former Scottish international footballer [[Alan Brazil]]. On this show, he picked up the nickname Chicken from the dish Chicken Biriyani rhyming with his surname.

former England [[cricket]]er who played Tests and ODIs for England. He played only three [[Test cricket|Tests]] for [[English cricket team|England]], with decidedly mixed success, but found a niche in [[One Day International]]s, where he gained much praise for his performances.\n\nHe spent most of his career at [[Essex County Cricket Club]], latterly as [[captain (cricket)|captain]], after starting at [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]]. He is of [[Irani (India)|Irani]] descent, the Iranis being a community of [[Persian people|Persian]] [[Zoroastrian]]s who immigrated to India during the [[British Raj]].\n\nIrani was a genuine [[all-rounder]] until a knee injury in 2003 forced him to stop bowling and play as a specialist batsman. The recurring nature of this injury led to Irani being forced to retire from [[first-class cricket]] in June 2007. At Essex, Irani helped bring through promising players such as [[Alastair Cook]] (England Captain) and [[Ravinder Bopara]] (England Player) as well as winning two major One-Day Titles. Professionally he scored over 20,000 runs and took more than 650 wickets during his career.\n\nHe announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the end of the 2007 season.\n\n==Personal life==\nIrani's father Jimmy Irani arrived in Bolton from Bombay in 1961 to play a summer's club cricket. During that summer he met 16-year-old Lancastrian Anne Main. The two married and had a son, Ronnie. Jimmy Irani was an enthusiastic, successful and prolific club cricketer with Daisy Hill in the Bolton Association who often put up overseas players, such as [[Farokh Engineer]] and [[Javed Miandad]], during Ronnie's childhood.<ref name=\"Irani 2010\"/>\n\n==Domestic career==\n[[Image:Irani and Bopara.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Irani batting against [[Cambridge UCCE]], April 2005]]\nHe started his career playing for [[Lancashire County Cricket Club|Lancashire]] in 1990, before he moved to [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/2/2357/all_teams.html |title=Teams Ronnie Irani played for |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> At Essex, he gained [[Cult following|cult status]],<ref name=\"ciprof\">{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/england/content/player/15403.html |title=Player Profile: Ronnie Irani |publisher=ESPNcricinfo |accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref>  before he became [[Captain (cricket)|captain]] in 2000,<ref name=\"caprof\">{{cite web|url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/2/2357/2357.html |title=Player Profile: Ronnie Irani |publisher=CricketArchive |accessdate=16 December 2012}}</ref> and is generally accepted to have done a decent job in charge, helping to bring through promising players such as [[Alastair Cook]], [[Will Jefferson]] and [[Ravi Bopara]]. After [[Graham Gooch]] stepped down as the club's head coach prior to the start of the 2005 season, Irani assumed some of these responsibilities in addition to his role as county captain.<ref name=\"ciprof\"/>\n\nIn June 2007, he rejected a new contract with [[Essex County Cricket Club|Essex]] and announced his retirement from first-class cricket at the end of the 2007 season.

He scored 169 runs and took 8 wickets in the tri-series.\n\n==After retirement==\nAfter his retirement, he took on a position at [[talkSPORT]] in 2007, where he co-hosted, until 2013, ''The Alan Brazil Sports Breakfast'' with former Scottish international footballer [[Alan Brazil]]. On this show, he picked up the nickname Chicken from the dish Chicken Biriyani rhyming with his surname. Following Irani's appointment, the show's audience increased, reaching 1.2 million listeners by May 2008.{{cn|date=January 2020}} During his time at talkSPORT, Irani also appeared as a guest on the BBC quiz show [[A Question of Sport]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ronnie Irani|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3354683/|publisher=IMDb}}</ref>\n\nIn 2009 Irani's autobiography \"No Boundaries\" was published.<ref>https://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Boundaries-Ronnie-Irani/dp/1844548619</ref> He was also  part of a celebrity 'consortium' (along with [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] DJ [[Chris Evans (presenter)|Chris Evans]]) who clubbed together to pay for [[Paul Gascoigne]] to receive treatment for alcoholism in the US.<ref>https://www.standard.co.uk/news/celebritynews/chris-evans-and-ronnie-irani-help-gazza-get-treatment-8480969.html</ref>\n\nIn 2015, Irani took up the position of Cricket Committee Chairman at Essex and expressed his desire for the club to improve its performances.<ref>{{cite web|title=Essex: Ronnie Irani wants 'massive' improvement|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/33608159|publisher=BBC}}</ref> Irani was quoted as saying that, \u201cWe are still talented and it is great to see young players coming through like Nick Browne, Tom Westley and Jamie Porter.

The Ottomans made no allowances for the victims' age or gender, and massacred all with brutal force.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cleveland | first = William L. | title = A History of the Modern Middle East | edition = 2nd | location = Boulder, CO | publisher = Westview | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8133-3489-6 | page = [https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernm00clev/page/119 119] | url = https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernm00clev/page/119 }}</ref> This occurred at a time when the [[telegraph]] could spread news around the world, and the massacres received extensive coverage in the media of Western Europe and North America.\n\n==Background==\n{{main |Armenian Genocide}}\nThe origins of the hostility toward Armenians lay in the increasingly precarious position in which the Ottoman Empire found itself in the last quarter of the 19th century. The end of Ottoman dominion over the [[Balkans]] was ushered in by an era of European nationalism and an insistence on self-determination by many territories long held under Ottoman rule. The Armenians of the empire, who were long considered [[second-class citizens]], had begun in the mid-1860s and early 1870s to ask for civil reforms and better treatment from government. They pressed for an end to the usurpation of land, \"the looting and murder in Armenian towns by Kurds and Circassians, improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial.\"<ref>[[Taner Ak\u00e7am|Ak\u00e7am]]. ''[[A Shameful Act]]'', p. 36.</ref> These requests went unheeded by the central government. When a nascent form of nationalism spread among the Armenians of Anatolia, including demands for equal rights and a push for autonomy, the Ottoman leadership believed that the empire's Islamic character and even its very existence were threatened.\n\n===The Armenian Question===\n{{main|Armenian Question}}\nThe combination of Russian military success in the recent [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Russo-Turkish War]], the clear weakening of the Ottoman Empire in various spheres including financial (from 1873, the Ottoman Empire suffered greatly from the [[Panic of 1873]]), territorial (mentioned above), and the hope among some Armenians that one day all of the Armenian territory might be ruled by Russia, led to a new restiveness among Armenians living inside the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians sent a delegation led by [[Mkrtich Khrimian]] to the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]] to lobby the European powers to include proper safeguards for their kinsmen in the eventual peace agreement.\n\nThe sultan, however, was not prepared to relinquish any power. Abdul Hamid believed that the woes of the Ottoman Empire stemmed from \"the endless persecutions and hostilities of the Christian world.\"<ref>[[Taner Ak\u00e7am|Ak\u00e7am]].

It is a most remarkable story, and the discrepancies are as thick as leaves in Valambrosa. On the face of it, it cannot be true, and before a jury it would hardly have any weight as evidence. It is extremely important, however, because it is probably a fair representation of the occurrences of the last few years. That it is a misrepresentation, so much so that it can fairly be called fabrication, becomes clear when you look at it a second time... and yet it is from an official document which the future historian will read when he wishes to compile the facts concerning those massacres.<ref>{{cite book |title=Through Armenia On Horseback | last = Hepworth |first=George H |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1898 |publisher=E.

The harshest measures were directed against the long persecuted Armenian community as calls for civil reform and better treatment from the government went ignored. The Ottomans made no allowances for the victims' age or gender, and massacred all with brutal force.<ref>{{cite book | last = Cleveland | first = William L. | title = A History of the Modern Middle East | edition = 2nd | location = Boulder, CO | publisher = Westview | year = 2000 | isbn = 0-8133-3489-6 | page = [https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernm00clev/page/119 119] | url = https://archive.org/details/historyofmodernm00clev/page/119 }}</ref> This occurred at a time when the [[telegraph]] could spread news around the world, and the massacres received extensive coverage in the media of Western Europe and North America.\n\n==Background==\n{{main |Armenian Genocide}}\nThe origins of the hostility toward Armenians lay in the increasingly precarious position in which the Ottoman Empire found itself in the last quarter of the 19th century. The end of Ottoman dominion over the [[Balkans]] was ushered in by an era of European nationalism and an insistence on self-determination by many territories long held under Ottoman rule. The Armenians of the empire, who were long considered [[second-class citizens]], had begun in the mid-1860s and early 1870s to ask for civil reforms and better treatment from government. They pressed for an end to the usurpation of land, \"the looting and murder in Armenian towns by Kurds and Circassians, improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial.\"<ref>[[Taner Ak\u00e7am|Ak\u00e7am]]. ''[[A Shameful Act]]'', p. 36.</ref> These requests went unheeded by the central government. When a nascent form of nationalism spread among the Armenians of Anatolia, including demands for equal rights and a push for autonomy, the Ottoman leadership believed that the empire's Islamic character and even its very existence were threatened.\n\n===The Armenian Question===\n{{main|Armenian Question}}\nThe combination of Russian military success in the recent [[Russo-Turkish War, 1877\u20131878|Russo-Turkish War]], the clear weakening of the Ottoman Empire in various spheres including financial (from 1873, the Ottoman Empire suffered greatly from the [[Panic of 1873]]), territorial (mentioned above), and the hope among some Armenians that one day all of the Armenian territory might be ruled by Russia, led to a new restiveness among Armenians living inside the Ottoman Empire. The Armenians sent a delegation led by [[Mkrtich Khrimian]] to the 1878 [[Congress of Berlin]] to lobby the European powers to include proper safeguards for their kinsmen in the eventual peace agreement.\n\nThe sultan, however, was not prepared to relinquish any power. Abdul Hamid believed that the woes of the Ottoman Empire stemmed from \"the endless persecutions and hostilities of the Christian world.\"<ref>[[Taner Ak\u00e7am|Ak\u00e7am]].

Many were fearfully mangled and mutilated. I saw one with his face completely smashed in with a blow of some heavy weapon after he was killed. I saw some with their own necks almost severed by a sword cut. One I saw whose whole chest had been skinned, his fore-arms were cut off, while the upper arm was skinned of flesh. I asked if the dogs had done this. \"No, the Turks did it with their knives.\" A dozen bodies were half burned. All the corpses had been rifled of all their clothes except a cotton undergarment or two....To be killed in battle by brave men is one thing; to be butchered by cowardly armed soldiers in cold blood and utterly defenseless is another thing.<ref>Quoted in Gia Aivazian (2003), \"The W.

It is one of only a handful of primary/secondary main lines to be preserved in Britain today.\n\n== The route ==\nThe Strathspey Railway operates from Network Rail's [[Aviemore railway station]]. Until 1998 the railway's southern terminus was [[Aviemore (Speyside) railway station|Aviemore Speyside]] about 300 yards further north. Aviemore Speyside is no longer in regular use, though it has been retained as a fallback in case of problems with [[Network Rail]].  Its [[signal box]], which was formerly at Garve West and transported from there in 1986, was retained when the station itself shut and new features are gradually being brought into service, using traditional British Railways mechanical semaphore signalling, to control a new crossing loop which has yet to be installed.\n\nFrom Aviemore, the line passes the four road [[locomotive shed]] which was constructed by the [[Highland Railway]] in 1898. The original purpose of the shed was to house locomotives for the lines to Perth and Inverness (via Carrbridge and Forres). It was common for original Highland Railway engines to be allocated to the shed and in [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS) days it housed [[William Stanier|Stanier]] [[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0|Black Five]]s, [[William Pickersgill|Pickersgill]] Bogies ([[Caledonian Railway]]), Caley 439 tanks, Caley 812 classes, and [[Charles E. Fairburn|Fairburn]] [[Tank locomotive|tanks]]. In [[British Railways]] days the shed was allocated the shed code '60B'. These days the engines that are in traffic on the Strathspey Railway (SR) bear the 60B shedplate on their smokebox. There is also a carriage maintenance shed which was erected and opened for use in 2005; this shed allows the railway's volunteers and staff to work on its fleet of coaches indoors.  On the opposite side of the line is a three road carriage storage shed erected and opened in 2011; this allows the coaches to be stored under cover and protected from the weather. Coaling is carried out at Aviemore using a facility constructed in 2014 on the site of the former Aviemore Speyside station building.\n\nThe former enginemens' hostel called '[[River Spey|Spey]] Lodge' also stands at this location. This building has now reverted to its original use of housing locomotive crews and other railway volunteers. This building was erected by the LMS during the [[Second World War]] to allow railway crews a safe and cheap option for accommodation after they had finished working on their trains for the day. It was saved by the Strathspey Railway Company during the 1970s.\n\nAfter Spey Lodge, the railway crosses Dalfaber level crossing, an Automatic Open Crossing, Locally Monitored (AOCL). This level crossing was not originally part of the railway but was installed after the development of the Dalfaber Estate in the 1980s.\n\n=== Boat of Garten ===\n[[File:Boat of Garten railway station.jpg|thumb|Boat of Garten in 1961]]\n[[File:Boat of Garten station geograph-3267592-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|View northward, towards Broomhill 1986]]\n[[File:Boat of Garten station geograph-3267586-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|View southward, towards Aviemore in 1986]]\n[[File:Boat of Garten Steam Rally - geograph.org.uk - 352474.jpg|thumb|Steam rally in 2004]]\nThe extensive Boat of Garten station {{nowrap|({{coord|57.2480|-3.7524|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline|name=Boat of Garten railway station}})}} features its original buildings, dating from 1904 by the architect William Roberts and is a category B listed building.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Buildings of Scotland, Highland and Islands| first=John| last=Gifford| publisher=Yale University Press| year=1992| isbn=0-300-09625-9}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}}<ref>{{cite web |title=BOAT OF GARTEN RAILWAY STATION INCLUDING FORMER STATION MASTER'S HOUSE, NORTH SIGNAL BOX, SOUTH SIGNAL BOX AND FOOTBRIDGE |url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB258 |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=7 March 2019}}</ref> It was originally a parallel junction between the Highland Railway's main line from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] to Forres and the [[Great North of Scotland Railway]]'s (GNSR) branch to Craigellachie - this was the original Strathspey Railway, the company being a subsidiary of the GNSR. Today there are two passenger platforms and the yard stores the majority of the SR's out of use [[Railroad car|rolling stock]].\n\nBoat of Garten also has the railway's only water column where the locomotives stop to take water on their way north through the station. There are two signal boxes, Boat of Garten North and Boat of Garten South and signalling uses traditional British Railways mechanical semaphore signalling; it is the crossing point on the line when there are two trains running.\n\nMost of what visitors to the railway see today is original from the days of British Railways. The main layout of the station has not been altered significantly, with the exception of the extensive yard behind the signal box. The turnout that formerly allowed access to the yard without having to access the [[headshunt]] was removed before the line closed and there are no plans to re-install it.\n\nLeaving Boat of Garten, trains cross the road on the new single track box-girder bridge and pass the site of the original GNSR engine shed; long demolished, it is now the site of a [[permanent way]] depot. The track had been lifted and structures demolished by [[British Rail]] after closure of the line in the 1960s. The railway passes through mainly farmland on the re-laid track, which was mostly recovered from [[Kincardine power station]] in [[Fife]] in the 1990s. The tracks to Craigellachie and [[Grantown-on-Spey|Grantown]] had originally left the station extending in a [[double track]] formation as far as Croftnahaven, where the GNSR line turned sharply south east and crossed the [[River Spey]]. This arrangement was adopted because a [[signal box]] for a junction here was deemed too expensive.\n\n=== Broomhill ===\nThe line reaches its current terminus at [[Broomhill railway station|Broomhill]] {{nowrap|({{coord|57.2834|-3.6669|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline|name=Broomhill railway station}})}}, in countryside roughly halfway between the villages of Nethy Bridge and Dulnain Bridge. The replica station building has been reconstructed on the foundations of the original. The run-round loop is beyond the station. It is anticipated that this will be removed when the extension to Grantown is complete. [[Broomhill railway station|Broomhill]] was used as the station for [[Glenbogle]], in the [[BBC Scotland|BBC]] series \"[[Monarch of the Glen (TV series)|Monarch of the Glen]]\".\n<gallery>\nFile:Broomhill towards Grantown.JPG|<center>Broomhill looking towards Grantown on Spey.</center>\nFile:Glenbogle at Broomhill.JPG|<center>The 'Glenbogle' station sign at [[Broomhill railway station|Broomhill station]]</center>\nFile:Broomhill Strathspey.JPG|<center>A view of the platform and station buildings looking towards Boat of Garten</center>\nFile:Broomhill station approach.JPG|<center>The station approach from the Boat of Garten side</center>\nFile:Broomhill station.JPG|<center>Platform and station infrastructure</center>\n</gallery>\n\n== Future extension ==\nIn July 2006, the Scottish Executive made a firm commitment to re-aligning the A95 at Gaich, near Grantown. This move would allow the extension of the SR to Grantown along the original [[Highland Railway]] line to [[Dava, Scotland|Dava]] and Forres.  It is not now intended to reconstruct the former [[Grantown-on-Spey West railway station]], now in an industrial estate; instead it is proposed to construct a new three platform terminus on a greenfield site about 3/4 track-mile further north.  Track that was lifted from the [[Stirling]] to [[Alloa]] railway when it was relaid for a new passenger service has been donated to this project.\n\nThe BBC reported that the \u00a32.9m road scheme would involve the rail line going under the A95. The then Transport Minister, [[Tavish Scott]], said the project would be ready for construction by 2008/9 and funding had been allocated for 2009/10. Former Strathspey MP, [[Danny Alexander]], speculated that the proposed rail link between Aviemore and Grantown would be good for tourism.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/5158134.stm| title=Go-ahead for Highland road move| work=BBC News| date=7 July 2006| accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nBy May 2007 the trackbed had been cleared north of the Broomhill loop as far as the bridge over the River Dulnain. New fencing, mileposts and drainage works were progressing and it was hoped for track laying to start later in 2008. Travelling by road along the A95 from Grantown towards Aviemore, new fencing marking the new track alignment could be seen.\n\nIn October 2008, it was announced that the steelwork of the former Merry Street Bridge in [[Motherwell]] had been donated to the railway by Network Rail. In February 2014, the Strathspey Railway used this steelwork to replace the missing bridge over the River Dulnain.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-26191444| title=Strathspey Steam Railway use crane for new bridge| work=BBC Scotland News| date=14 February 2014}}</ref> The bridge was installed, with the railway working with [[Colas Rail]], who provided one of the few rail cranes in the UK capable of lifting the bridge into position.  Following the installation, track has been laid across the bridge to the north side of the River Dulnain.  No further construction work on the extension can be carried out until the Scottish Government grants the appropriate Statutory Order.  Because the entire extension lies within the [[Cairngorm National Park]], the formal application has had to be delayed so that additional wildlfe and environmental studies can be undertaken.\n\nHowever, Transport Scotland since notified the railway that the project has been reevaluated in late 2008 and was now estimated to cost \u00a35.3&nbsp;million, leading Transport Scotland to consider the extension project too expensive to pursue. The railway was faced with raising \u00a31&nbsp;million by 31 December 2009, to fund construction of a planned tunnel on the extension, but even if the funds were raised, construction was not guaranteed to occur.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Railway Magazine| page=11| title=\u00a31m shock for Strathspey Railway|date=December 2008| volume=154| issue=1,292 }}</ref>  In June 2016, the entire project, including the re-aligned A95 and new bridge at Gaich, track and new station, was estimated at \u00a313.5M\n\nManagement for building extension is now being undertaken by a new body, The Strathspey Railway Charitable Trust. All the various fundraising efforts are co-ordinated by the SRCT, including a charitable appeal. They also manage the negotiations with the various landowners and public bodies required to push the line through to Grantown-on-Spey.\n\n== Strathspey Railway Association ==\nThe role of the Strathspey Railway Association is to provide funding and volunteers to run the Strathspey Railway. It is the biggest shareholder in the Strathspey Railway Company, the organisation which owns the light rail orders and operates the railway.\n\nMost of the people who work on the railway are volunteers belonging to the Association.\n\n== Locomotives and rolling stock ==\n[[File:StrathspeyRailway-pjt.jpg|thumb|British Railways No. 46512, an Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0]]\n[[File:Caledonian 828 at Aviemore Station (geograph 3156171).jpg|thumb|The unique Caledonian Railway 812 Class 0-6-0 No. 828]]\n[[File:Barclay 060t No 17 Aviemore.jpg|thumb|Andrew Barclay 0-6-0T No. 17 \"Braeriach\"]]\n\n===Steam locomotives===\n*LMS 2-6-0 [[LMS Class 2MT 2-6-0|Class 2MT]] no. 46512 \"E.

It is one of only a handful of primary/secondary main lines to be preserved in Britain today.\n\n== The route ==\nThe Strathspey Railway operates from Network Rail's [[Aviemore railway station]]. Until 1998 the railway's southern terminus was [[Aviemore (Speyside) railway station|Aviemore Speyside]] about 300 yards further north. Aviemore Speyside is no longer in regular use, though it has been retained as a fallback in case of problems with [[Network Rail]].  Its [[signal box]], which was formerly at Garve West and transported from there in 1986, was retained when the station itself shut and new features are gradually being brought into service, using traditional British Railways mechanical semaphore signalling, to control a new crossing loop which has yet to be installed.\n\nFrom Aviemore, the line passes the four road [[locomotive shed]] which was constructed by the [[Highland Railway]] in 1898. The original purpose of the shed was to house locomotives for the lines to Perth and Inverness (via Carrbridge and Forres). It was common for original Highland Railway engines to be allocated to the shed and in [[London, Midland and Scottish Railway]] (LMS) days it housed [[William Stanier|Stanier]] [[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0|Black Five]]s, [[William Pickersgill|Pickersgill]] Bogies ([[Caledonian Railway]]), Caley 439 tanks, Caley 812 classes, and [[Charles E. Fairburn|Fairburn]] [[Tank locomotive|tanks]]. In [[British Railways]] days the shed was allocated the shed code '60B'. These days the engines that are in traffic on the Strathspey Railway (SR) bear the 60B shedplate on their smokebox. There is also a carriage maintenance shed which was erected and opened for use in 2005; this shed allows the railway's volunteers and staff to work on its fleet of coaches indoors.  On the opposite side of the line is a three road carriage storage shed erected and opened in 2011; this allows the coaches to be stored under cover and protected from the weather. Coaling is carried out at Aviemore using a facility constructed in 2014 on the site of the former Aviemore Speyside station building.\n\nThe former enginemens' hostel called '[[River Spey|Spey]] Lodge' also stands at this location. This building has now reverted to its original use of housing locomotive crews and other railway volunteers. This building was erected by the LMS during the [[Second World War]] to allow railway crews a safe and cheap option for accommodation after they had finished working on their trains for the day. It was saved by the Strathspey Railway Company during the 1970s.\n\nAfter Spey Lodge, the railway crosses Dalfaber level crossing, an Automatic Open Crossing, Locally Monitored (AOCL). This level crossing was not originally part of the railway but was installed after the development of the Dalfaber Estate in the 1980s.\n\n=== Boat of Garten ===\n[[File:Boat of Garten railway station.jpg|thumb|Boat of Garten in 1961]]\n[[File:Boat of Garten station geograph-3267592-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|View northward, towards Broomhill 1986]]\n[[File:Boat of Garten station geograph-3267586-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|View southward, towards Aviemore in 1986]]\n[[File:Boat of Garten Steam Rally - geograph.org.uk - 352474.jpg|thumb|Steam rally in 2004]]\nThe extensive Boat of Garten station {{nowrap|({{coord|57.2480|-3.7524|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline|name=Boat of Garten railway station}})}} features its original buildings, dating from 1904 by the architect William Roberts and is a category B listed building.<ref>{{cite book| title=The Buildings of Scotland, Highland and Islands| first=John| last=Gifford| publisher=Yale University Press| year=1992| isbn=0-300-09625-9}}</ref>{{page needed|date=September 2019}}<ref>{{cite web |title=BOAT OF GARTEN RAILWAY STATION INCLUDING FORMER STATION MASTER'S HOUSE, NORTH SIGNAL BOX, SOUTH SIGNAL BOX AND FOOTBRIDGE |url=http://portal.historicenvironment.scot/designation/LB258 |publisher=Historic Scotland |accessdate=7 March 2019}}</ref> It was originally a parallel junction between the Highland Railway's main line from [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] to Forres and the [[Great North of Scotland Railway]]'s (GNSR) branch to Craigellachie - this was the original Strathspey Railway, the company being a subsidiary of the GNSR. Today there are two passenger platforms and the yard stores the majority of the SR's out of use [[Railroad car|rolling stock]].\n\nBoat of Garten also has the railway's only water column where the locomotives stop to take water on their way north through the station. There are two signal boxes, Boat of Garten North and Boat of Garten South and signalling uses traditional British Railways mechanical semaphore signalling; it is the crossing point on the line when there are two trains running.\n\nMost of what visitors to the railway see today is original from the days of British Railways. The main layout of the station has not been altered significantly, with the exception of the extensive yard behind the signal box. The turnout that formerly allowed access to the yard without having to access the [[headshunt]] was removed before the line closed and there are no plans to re-install it.\n\nLeaving Boat of Garten, trains cross the road on the new single track box-girder bridge and pass the site of the original GNSR engine shed; long demolished, it is now the site of a [[permanent way]] depot. The track had been lifted and structures demolished by [[British Rail]] after closure of the line in the 1960s. The railway passes though mainly farmland on the re-laid track, which was mostly recovered from [[Kincardine power station]] in [[Fife]] in the 1990s. The tracks to Craigellachie and [[Grantown-on-Spey|Grantown]] had originally left the station extending in a [[double track]] formation as far as Croftnahaven, where the GNSR line turned sharply south east and crossed the [[River Spey]]. This arrangement was adopted because a [[signal box]] for a junction here was deemed too expensive.\n\n=== Broomhill ===\nThe line reaches its current terminus at [[Broomhill railway station|Broomhill]] {{nowrap|({{coord|57.2834|-3.6669|type:railwaystation_region:GB|display=inline|name=Broomhill railway station}})}}, in countryside roughly halfway between the villages of Nethy Bridge and Dulnain Bridge. The replica station building has been reconstructed on the foundations of the original. The run-round loop is beyond the station. It is anticipated that this will be removed when the extension to Grantown is complete. [[Broomhill railway station|Broomhill]] was used as the station for [[Glenbogle]], in the [[BBC Scotland|BBC]] series \"[[Monarch of the Glen (TV series)|Monarch of the Glen]]\".\n<gallery>\nFile:Broomhill towards Grantown.JPG|<center>Broomhill looking towards Grantown on Spey.</center>\nFile:Glenbogle at Broomhill.JPG|<center>The 'Glenbogle' station sign at [[Broomhill railway station|Broomhill station]]</center>\nFile:Broomhill Strathspey.JPG|<center>A view of the platform and station buildings looking towards Boat of Garten</center>\nFile:Broomhill station approach.JPG|<center>The station approach from the Boat of Garten side</center>\nFile:Broomhill station.JPG|<center>Platform and station infrastructure</center>\n</gallery>\n\n== Future extension ==\nIn July 2006, the Scottish Executive made a firm commitment to re-aligning the A95 at Gaich, near Grantown. This move would allow the extension of the SR to Grantown along the original [[Highland Railway]] line to [[Dava, Scotland|Dava]] and Forres.  It is not now intended to reconstruct the former [[Grantown-on-Spey West railway station]], now in an industrial estate; instead it is proposed to construct a new three platform terminus on a greenfield site about 3/4 track-mile further north.  Track that was lifted from the [[Stirling]] to [[Alloa]] railway when it was relaid for a new passenger service has been donated to this project.\n\nThe BBC reported that the \u00a32.9m road scheme would involve the rail line going under the A95. The then Transport Minister, [[Tavish Scott]], said the project would be ready for construction by 2008/9 and funding had been allocated for 2009/10. Former Strathspey MP, [[Danny Alexander]], speculated that the proposed rail link between Aviemore and Grantown would be good for tourism.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/highlands_and_islands/5158134.stm| title=Go-ahead for Highland road move| work=BBC News| date=7 July 2006| accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nBy May 2007 the trackbed had been cleared north of the Broomhill loop as far as the bridge over the River Dulnain. New fencing, mileposts and drainage works were progressing and it was hoped for track laying to start later in 2008. Travelling by road along the A95 from Grantown towards Aviemore, new fencing marking the new track alignment could be seen.\n\nIn October 2008, it was announced that the steelwork of the former Merry Street Bridge in [[Motherwell]] had been donated to the railway by Network Rail. In February 2014, the Strathspey Railway used this steelwork to replace the missing bridge over the River Dulnain.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-26191444| title=Strathspey Steam Railway use crane for new bridge| work=BBC Scotland News| date=14 February 2014}}</ref> The bridge was installed, with the railway working with [[Colas Rail]], who provided one of the few rail cranes in the UK capable of lifting the bridge into position.  Following the installation, track has been laid across the bridge to the north side of the River Dulnain.  No further construction work on the extension can be carried out until the Scottish Government grants the appropriate Statutory Order.  Because the entire extension lies within the [[Cairngorm National Park]], the formal application has had to be delayed so that additional wildlfe and environmental studies can be undertaken.\n\nHowever, Transport Scotland since notified the railway that the project has been reevaluated in late 2008 and was now estimated to cost \u00a35.3&nbsp;million, leading Transport Scotland to consider the extension project too expensive to pursue. The railway was faced with raising \u00a31&nbsp;million by 31 December 2009, to fund construction of a planned tunnel on the extension, but even if the funds were raised, construction was not guaranteed to occur.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=The Railway Magazine| page=11| title=\u00a31m shock for Strathspey Railway|date=December 2008| volume=154| issue=1,292 }}</ref>  In June 2016, the entire project, including the re-aligned A95 and new bridge at Gaich, track and new station, was estimated at \u00a313.5M\n\nManagement for building extension is now being undertaken by a new body, The Strathspey Railway Charitable Trust. All the various fundraising efforts are co-ordinated by the SRCT, including a charitable appeal. They also manage the negotiations with the various landowners and public bodies required to push the line through to Grantown-on-Spey.\n\n== Strathspey Railway Association ==\nThe role of the Strathspey Railway Association is to provide funding and volunteers to run the Strathspey Railway. It is the biggest shareholder in the Strathspey Railway Company, the organisation which owns the light rail orders and operates the railway.\n\nMost of the people who work on the railway are volunteers belonging to the Association.\n\n== Locomotives and rolling stock ==\n[[File:StrathspeyRailway-pjt.jpg|thumb|British Railways No. 46512, an Ivatt Class 2 2-6-0]]\n[[File:Caledonian 828 at Aviemore Station (geograph 3156171).jpg|thumb|The unique Caledonian Railway 812 Class 0-6-0 No. 828]]\n[[File:Barclay 060t No 17 Aviemore.jpg|thumb|Andrew Barclay 0-6-0T No. 17 \"Braeriach\"]]\n\n===Steam locomotives===\n*LMS 2-6-0 [[LMS Class 2MT 2-6-0|Class 2MT]] no. 46512 \"E.

The earliest known [[recorded history]] [[Classical African civilization|arose]] in [[Ancient Egypt]], and later in [[Nubia]], the [[Sahel]], the [[Maghreb]] and the [[Horn of Africa]].\n\nFollowing the [[desertification]] of the [[Sahara]], North African history became entwined with the [[Middle East]] and [[Southern Europe]] while the [[Bantu expansion]] swept from modern day [[Cameroon]] (Central Africa) across much of the sub-Saharan continent in waves between around 1000 BC and 0 [[AD]], creating a linguistic commonality across much of the central and Southern continent.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]] spread west from Arabia to Egypt, crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel. Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the [[Ajuran Empire]], [[D'mt]], [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Alodia]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Kingdom of Nri]], [[Nok culture]], [[Mali Empire]], [[Songhai Empire]], [[Benin Empire]], [[Oyo Empire]], [[Kingdom of Lunda (Punu-yaka)]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Ghana Empire]], [[Mossi Kingdoms]], [[Mutapa Empire]], [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]], [[Kingdom of Sine]], [[Sennar (sultanate)|Kingdom of Sennar]], [[Kingdom of Saloum]], [[Kingdom of Baol]], Kingdom of [[Cayor]], [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Kingdom of Kongo]], Empire of [[Kaabu]], Kingdom of [[Ile Ife]], [[Ancient Carthage]], [[Numidia]], [[Mauretania]], and the [[Aksumite Empire]]. At its peak, prior to European [[colonialism]], it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs.<ref name=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/31/getting-to-know-africa-50-facts/\">Africa Information</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-7th century, the [[Arab slave trade]] saw Muslim Arabs enslave Africans. Following an armistice between the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Kingdom of Makuria]] after the [[Second Battle of Dongola]] in 652 AD, they were transported, along with Asians and Europeans, across the [[Red Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Sahara Desert]].\n\nFrom the late 15th century, Europeans joined the slave trade. One could say the Portuguese led in partnership with other Europeans. That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. They transported enslaved [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Southern Africa|Southern]] Africans overseas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slavetrade.htm |title = African Slave Trade, 1788}}</ref> Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881\u20131914).  However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the [[Second World War]] {{nowrap|(1939\u20131945)}}, [[decolonization]] took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 [[Year of Africa]].\n\nDisciplines such as recording of [[oral history]], [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology of Africa|archaeology]] and [[genetics]] have been vital in rediscovering the great African civilizations of antiquity.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n{{Human history}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Further|Prehistoric North Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa#Prehistory|History of West Africa#Prehistory|Central Africa#Prehistory|East Africa#Prehistory|Horn of Africa#Prehistory|African archaeology}}\n\n===Paleolithic===\n{{Main|Lower Paleolithic|Middle Stone Age|Later Stone Age}}\nThe first known [[Hominidae|hominids]] evolved in Africa. According to [[paleontology]], the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the [[gorilla]] and the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]], [[great apes]] that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion which freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), ''History of Africa'', p. 2. Rev. 2nd ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.</ref>\n\nBy 4 million years ago, several [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] hominid species had developed throughout [[Southern Africa|Southern]], [[East Africa|Eastern]] and [[Central Africa]]. They were tool users, and makers of tools. They scavenged for meat and were omnivores.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 2.</ref>\n\nBy approximately 3.3 million years ago, primitive stone tools were first used to scavenge kills made by other predators and to harvest carrion and marrow from their bones. In hunting, ''[[Homo habilis]]'' was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was still more prey than hunter. ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, p. 2-3\">Shillington (2005), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAround 1.8 million years ago, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like ''H. habilis''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Possibly the first hunters, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of [[Afro-Eurasia]] and perhaps later giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers have suggested that ''[[Homo georgicus]]'' was the first and primary hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 3.</ref><ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002), ''The Civilizations of Africa'', p. 22.

The regions with the largest population pressure were in the [[Nile Delta]] region of [[Lower Egypt]], in [[Upper Egypt]], and also along the [[Cataracts of the Nile|second and third cataracts]] of the [[Dongola Reach]] of the Nile in Nubia. This population pressure and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was [[Ta-Seti]], founded around 3,500 BC. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 143\u2013146.</ref>\n\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[pyramids of Giza]], symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt]]\nLater consolidation of the chiefdoms into broader political entities began to occur in Upper and Lower Egypt, culminating into the unification of Egypt into one political entity by [[Narmer]] ([[Menes]]) in 3,100 BC. Instead of being viewed as a sacral chief, he became a [[Imperial cult|divine king]]. The [[henotheism]], or worship of a single god within a polytheistic system, practiced in the sacral chiefdoms along Upper and Lower Egypt, became the polytheistic [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Bureaucracies became more centralized under the [[pharaoh]]s, run by [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]], governors, tax collectors, generals, artists, and technicians. They engaged in tax collecting, organizing of labor for major public works, and building irrigation systems, [[pyramid]]s, temples, and canals. During the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2,620\u20132,480 BC), long distance trade was developed, with the [[Levant]] for timber, with Nubia for gold and skins, with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] for [[frankincense]], and also with the western Libyan territories. For most of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], Egypt developed her fundamental systems, institutions and culture, always through the central bureaucracy and by the divinity of the [[Pharaoh]].<ref>Davidson, Basil (1991), ''Africa In History: Themes and Outlines'', pp. 30\u201333.

Connections with the southern regions of [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], Wawat and Irthet at the second cataract were made stronger. Then came the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], with the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] on horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and utilizing bronze weapons, a technology heretofore unseen in Egypt. Horse-drawn chariots soon spread to the west in the inhabitable Sahara and North Africa. The Hyksos failed to hold on to their Egyptian territories and were absorbed by Egyptian society. This eventually led to one of Egypt's most powerful phases, the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1,580\u20131,080 BC), with the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]].

This reassertion led to the conquest of Egypt by Nubia, begun by [[Kashta]] and completed by [[Piye]] (Pianhky, 751\u2013730 BC) and [[Shabaka]] (716\u2013695 BC). This was the birth of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]]. The Nubians tried to re-establish Egyptian traditions and customs. They ruled Egypt for a hundred years. This was ended by an [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] invasion, with [[Taharqa]] experiencing the full might of Assyrian iron weapons.

It lasted until 525 BC, when Egypt was invaded by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persians]]. Unlike the Assyrians, the Persians stayed. In 332, Egypt was conquered by [[Alexander the Great]]. This was the beginning of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], which ended with [[Egypt (Roman province)|Roman conquest]] in 30 BC.

Ta-Seti was a powerful sacral kingdom in the Nile Valley at the 1st and 2nd cataracts that exerted an influence over nearby chiefdoms based on pictorial representation ruling over [[Upper Egypt]]. Ta-Seti traded as far as [[Syro-Palestine]], as well as with Egypt. Ta-Seti exported gold, copper, ostrich feathers, [[ebony]] and [[ivory trade|ivory]] to the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]].

Kerma occupied a territory from the first cataract to the confluence of the [[Blue Nile]], [[White Nile]], and [[Atbarah River]]. About 1,575 to 1,550 BC, during the latter part of the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]], the Kingdom of Kerma invaded Egypt.<ref>Alberge, Dalya. \"Tomb Reveals Ancient Egypt's Humiliating Secret\", ''The Times'' {London}, 28 July 2003.</ref> The Kingdom of Kerma allied itself with the [[Hyksos]] invasion of Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nEgypt eventually re-energized under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and conquered the Kingdom of Kerma or [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], ruling it for almost 500 years. The Kushites were Egyptianized during this period. By 1100 BC, the Egyptians had withdrawn from Kush. The region regained independence and reasserted its culture. Kush built a new religion around [[Amun]] and made [[Napata]] its spiritual center. In 730 BC, the Kingdom of Kush invaded Egypt, taking over [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and beginning the Nubian Empire.

Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to [[Mer\u00f6e]], developing a new Nubian culture. Initially, Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of iron-making and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing was replaced by the [[Meroitic alphabet]]. The lion god [[Apedemak]] was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods. Trade links to the [[Red Sea]] increased, linking Nubia with Mediterranean [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Its architecture and art diversified, with pictures of lions, ostriches, giraffes, and elephants. Eventually, with the rise of [[Aksum]], Nubia's trade links were broken and it suffered environmental degradation from the tree cutting required for iron production.

In 814 BC, Phoenicians from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] established the city of [[Carthage]]. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered the growth of the Berber kingdoms, [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]]. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the [[Garamantes]] of [[Fes|Fez]], who raided caravans.

Carthage lost the first two wars, and in the third it was destroyed, becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]], with the Berber Kingdom of Numidia assisting Rome. The Roman province of Africa became a major agricultural supplier of wheat, [[olive]]s, and [[olive oil]] to [[Roman Empire|imperial Rome]] via exorbitant taxation. Two centuries later, Rome brought the Berber kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania under its authority. In the 420's AD, [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]] invaded North Africa and Rome lost her territories.

[[Berber people|Berber]] civilization was already at a stage in which agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and political organization supported several states. Trade links between Carthage and the Berbers in the interior grew, but territorial expansion also resulted in the enslavement or military recruitment of some Berbers and in the extraction of tribute from others. By the early 4th century BC, Berbers formed one of the largest element, with Gauls, of the Carthaginian army.\n\nIn the [[Mercenary War]] (241-238 BC), a rebellion was instigated by mercenary soldiers of Carthage and African allies.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://dcc.dickinson.edu/nepos-hannibal/first-punic-war|title=The First Punic War {{!}} Dickinson College Commentaries|website=dcc.dickinson.edu|access-date=2020-02-26}}</ref> Berber soldiers participated after being unpaid following the defeat of Carthage in the [[First Punic War]]. Berbers succeeded in obtaining control of much of Carthage's North African territory, and they minted coins bearing the name Libyan, used in Greek to describe natives of North Africa. The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]]; in 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohad]]s and [[Almoravid dynasty]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times.

Starting in the 2nd century AD, these garrisons were manned mostly by local inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nAside from [[Carthage]], urbanization in North Africa came in part with the establishment of settlements of veterans under the Roman emperors [[Claudius]] (reigned 41\u201354), [[Nerva]] (96\u201398), and [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117).

The prosperity of most towns depended on [[agriculture]]. Called the \"granary of the empire\", North Africa became one of the largest exporters of grain in the empire, shipping to the provinces which did not produce cereals, like [[Roman Italy|Italy]] and [[Roman Greece|Greece]]. Other crops included fruit, figs, grapes, and beans. By the 2nd century AD, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire|Roman imperial decline]] seemed less serious in North Africa than elsewhere. However, uprisings did take place. In 238 AD, landowners rebelled unsuccessfully against imperial fiscal policies. Sporadic tribal revolts in the Mauretanian mountains followed from 253 to 288, during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The towns also suffered economic difficulties, and building activity almost ceased.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe towns of Roman North Africa had a substantial [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jewish population]].

More than eighty bishops, some from distant frontier regions of Numidia, attended the [[Council of Carthage (256)]] in 256. By the end of the 4th century, the settled areas had become [[Christianization|Christianized]], and some Berber tribes had converted ''en masse''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nA division in the church that came to be known as the [[Donatism|Donatist]] [[heresy]] began in 313 among [[Christians]] in North Africa. The Donatists stressed the holiness of the church and refused to accept the authority to administer the sacraments of those who had surrendered the scriptures when they were forbidden under the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284\u2013305). The Donatists also opposed the involvement of [[Constantine the Great]] (reigned 306\u2013337) in church affairs in contrast to the majority of Christians who welcomed official imperial recognition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe occasionally violent Donatist controversy has been characterized{{by whom|date=December 2013}} as a struggle between opponents and supporters of the Roman system. The most articulate North African critic of the Donatist position, which came to be called a heresy, was [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], bishop of [[Hippo Regius]]. Augustine maintained that the unworthiness of a minister did not affect the validity of the sacraments because their true minister was [[Jesus]] [[Christ]]. In his sermons and books Augustine, who is considered a leading exponent of Christian dogma, evolved a theory of the right of orthodox Christian rulers to use force against schismatics and heretics. Although the dispute was resolved by a decision of an imperial commission in Carthage in 411, Donatist communities continued to exist as late as the 6th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA decline in trade weakened Roman control.

Local opposition delayed full Byzantine control of the region for twelve years, however, and when imperial control came, it was but a shadow of the control exercised by Rome. Although an impressive series of fortifications were built, Byzantine rule was compromised by official corruption, incompetence, military weakness, and lack of concern in Constantinople for African affairs, which made it an easy target for the Arabs during the [[Early Muslim conquests]] .

D'mt traded through the [[Red Sea]] with Egypt and the Mediterranean, providing frankincense. By the 5th and 3rd centuries, D'mt had declined, and several successor states took its place. Later there was greater trade with [[South Arabia]], mainly with the port of [[Sabaeans|Saba]]. [[Adulis]] became an important commercial center in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. The interaction of the peoples in the two regions, the southern Arabia [[Sabaeans]] and the northern Ethiopians, resulted in the [[Ge'ez]] culture and language and eventual development of the [[Ge'ez script]]. Trade links increased and expanded from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, with Egypt, Israel, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome, to the Black Sea, and to Persia, India, and China. Aksum was known throughout those lands. By the 5th century BC, the region was very prosperous, exporting ivory, hippopotamus hides, gold dust, spices, and live elephants. It imported silver, gold, olive oil, and wine. Aksum manufactured glass crystal, brass, and copper for export. A powerful Aksum emerged, unifying parts of eastern Sudan, northern Ethiopia ([[Tigray Region|Tigre]]), and [[Eritrea]]. Its kings built stone palatial buildings and were buried under megalithic monuments. By 300 AD, Aksum was minting its own coins in silver and gold.<ref>Collins, Robert O., and James M.

He founded the Kongolo Dynasty, which was later ousted by [[Kalala Ilunga]]. Kalala expanded the kingdom west of [[Lake Kisale]]. A new centralized political system of spiritual kings (''balopwe'') with a court council of head governors and sub-heads all the way to village heads. The ''balopwe'' was the direct communicator with the ancestral spirits and chosen by them. Conquered states were integrated into the system and represented in the court, with their titles. The authority of the ''balopwe'' resided in his spiritual power rather than his military authority. The army was relatively small. The Luba was able to control regional trade and collect tribute for redistribution. Numerous offshoot states were formed with founders claiming descent from the Luba. The Luba political system spread throughout [[Central Africa]], southern [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]], [[Burundi]], [[Malawi]], [[Zambia]], [[Zimbabwe]], and the western Congo. Two major empires claiming Luba descent were the [[Lunda Empire]] and [[Maravi|Maravi Empire]]. The [[Bemba people]] and [[Basimba people]]  of northern Zambia were descended from Luba migrants who arrived in Zambia during the 17th century.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 138\u2013139.</ref><ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 159\u2013160.</ref>\n\n===Lunda Empire===\n{{Main|Kingdom of Lunda#Origin}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of the Lunda Empire}}\n[[File:Lunda houses-1854.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Lunda town and dwelling]]\n\nIn the 1450s, a [[Luba Empire|Luba]] from the royal family [[Ilunga Tshibinda]] married [[Lunda people|Lunda]] queen Rweej and united all Lunda peoples.

His son Naweej expanded the empire further and is known as the first Lunda emperor, with the title ''mwato yamvo'' (''mwaant yaav'', ''mwant yav''), the Lord of Vipers. The Luba political system was retained, and conquered peoples were integrated into the system.

''Kinguri'' became the title of kings of states founded by Queen Rweej's brother. The [[Luena people|Luena]] (Lwena) and [[Lozi people|Lozi]] (Luyani) in [[Zambia]] also claim descent from Kinguri. During the 17th century, a Lunda chief and warrior called [[Mwata Kazembe]] set up an [[Eastern Lunda]] kingdom in the valley of the [[Luapula River]]. The Lunda's western expansion also saw claims of descent by the [[Yaka people|Yaka]] and the [[Pende people|Pende]]. The Lunda linked Central Africa with the western coast trade.

The capital was [[M'banza-Kongo]]. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the ''manikongo''. Later, [[maize]] (corn) and [[cassava]] (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] at their ports at [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]]. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing [[millet]] as a main staple.<ref>Jevan Cherniwchana and Juan Moreno-Cruz, \"Maize and Precolonial Africa\", ''Journal of Development Economics'' 136 (January 2019), 137-150. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.10.008</ref>\n[[File:KingdomKongo1711.png|thumb|right|240px|Kongo in 1711]]\n\nBy the 16th century, the ''manikongo'' held authority from the Atlantic in the west to the [[Kwango River]] in the east. Each territory was assigned a ''mani-mpembe'' (provincial governor) by the ''manikongo''. In 1506, [[Afonso I of Kongo|Afonso I]] (1506\u20131542), a Christian, took over the throne. Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the [[Jaga (people)|Jaga]] invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the ''manikongo'' into exile. In 1574, Manikongo [[\u00c1lvaro I of Kongo|\u00c1lvaro I]] was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo [[Ant\u00f3nio I of Kongo|Ant\u00f3nio I]] (1661\u20131665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]].

Ndongo was ruled by the ''ngola''. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]]. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at [[Kingdom of Matamba|Matamba]], affiliated with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Nzinga]], who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives. The [[Imbangala]] formed the slave-raiding state of [[Kasanje Kingdom|Kasanje]], a major source of slaves during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 198\u2013199.</ref><ref>Davidson (1991), p. 158.</ref>\n\n===Horn of Africa===\n{{main|Horn of Africa#History}}\n\n====Somalia====\n{{main|History of Somalia}}\n[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Citadel]] of [[Gondershe|Gondershe, Somalia]] was an important city in the medieval [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]]]]\n\nThe [[History of Islam|birth of Islam]] opposite Somalia's Red Sea coast meant that Somali merchants and sailors living on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted [[Arab]] Muslim trading partners.

Conflict arose as to who should be the successor of the prophet. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] had initially taken control of the [[Caliphate]], with their capital at [[Damascus]]. Later, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] had taken control, moving the capital to [[Baghdad]]. The [[Berber people]], being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to [[Arab]] exclusivity in orthodox Islam, adopted [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] Islam, both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Numerous Kharijite kingdoms came and fell during the 8th and 9th centuries, asserting their independence from Baghdad. In the early 10th century, Shi'ite groups from Syria, claiming descent from Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]], founded the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] in the [[Maghreb]]. By 950, they had conquered all of the Maghreb and by 969 all of Egypt. They had immediately broken away from Baghdad.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to bring about a purer form of Islam among the [[Zenaga people|Sanhaja]] Berbers, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] founded the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in present-day [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], practiced an indigenous religion alongside Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the [[Lamtuna]] Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the [[Zenata]] Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar|Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the sons of the Lamtuna chief, the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], because it was too big to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the [[Ghana Empire]] in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). p 90.</ref>\n\n[[File:Safi minaret.png|thumb|left|250px|The Almohad minaret in Safi]]\n\nDuring the 10th through 13th centuries, there was a large-scale movement of [[bedouin]]s out of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. About 1050, a quarter of a million Arab nomads from Egypt moved into the Maghreb. Those following the northern coast were referred to as [[Banu Hilal]]. Those going south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] were the [[Banu Sulaym]]. This movement spread the use of the [[Arabic language]] and hastened the decline of the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] and the [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of North Africa. Later an Arabised Berber group, the Hawwara, went south to Nubia via Egypt.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nIn the 1140s, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] declared [[jihad]] on the [[Almoravids]], charging them with decadence and corruption. He united the northern Berbers against the Almoravids, overthrowing them and forming the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Empire. During this period, the Maghreb became thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamised]] and saw the spread of [[literacy]], the development of [[algebra]], and the use of the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and [[decimal]]s. By the 13th century, the Almohad states had split into three rival states. Muslim states were largely extinguished in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Around 1415, Portugal engaged in a ''[[reconquista]]'' of North Africa by capturing [[Ceuta]], and in later centuries Spain and Portugal acquired other ports on the North African coast. In 1492, at the end of the [[Granada War]], Spain defeated Muslims in the [[Emirate of Granada]], effectively ending eight centuries of Muslim domination in southern Iberia.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 88\u201392.</ref>\n\nPortugal and Spain took the ports of [[Tangiers]], [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]], and [[Tunis]]. This put them in direct competition with the [[Ottoman Empire]], which re-took the ports using Turkish corsairs ([[Piracy|pirates]] and [[privateer]]s). The Turkish corsairs would use the ports for raiding Christian ships, a major source of booty for the towns. Technically, North Africa was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but only the coastal towns were fully under [[Istanbul]]'s control. Tripoli benefited from trade with [[Borno State|Borno]]. The [[pashas]] of Tripoli traded horses, firearms, and armor via Fez with the sultans of the [[Bornu Empire]] for slaves.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 166\u2013167</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, an Arab nomad tribe that claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadis]], conquered and united [[Morocco]]. They prevented the Ottoman Empire from reaching to the Atlantic and expelled Portugal from Morocco's western coast. [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought the state to the height of its power. He invaded [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]] in 1591, to control the gold trade, which had been diverted to the western coast of Africa for European ships and to the east, to Tunis. Morocco's hold on Songhay diminished in the 17th century. In 1603, after Ahmad's death, the kingdom split into the two sultanates of [[Fes]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Later it was reunited by [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al-Rashid]], founder of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] (1672\u20131727). His brother and successor, [[Ismail ibn Sharif]] (1672\u20131727), strengthened the unity of the country by importing slaves from the Sudan to build up the military.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\n====Nile Valley====\n{{See|Nile#History}}\n\n=====Egypt=====\n{{Main|History of Egypt#Arab and Ottoman Egypt (641\u20131882)}}\n{{Further|Lists of rulers of Egypt}}\n[[File:Fatimid Caliphate.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Fatimid Caliphate]]\n\nIn 642 AD, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Byzantine Egypt]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67\"/>\n\nEgypt under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was prosperous. Dams and canals were repaired, and wheat, barley, flax, and cotton production increased. Egypt became a major producer of linen and cotton cloth. Its Mediterranean and Red Sea trade increased. Egypt also minted a gold currency called the Fatimid dinar, which was used for international trade. The bulk of revenues came from taxing the [[fellah]]in ([[peasant]] farmers), and taxes were high. Tax collecting was leased to [[Berber people|Berber]] overlords, who were soldiers who had taken part in the Fatimid conquest in 969 AD. The overlords paid a share to the caliphs and retained what was left. Eventually, they became landlords and constituted a settled land aristocracy.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 157.</ref>\n\nTo fill the military ranks, [[Mamluk]] Turkish slave cavalry and Sudanese slave infantry were used. Berber freemen were also recruited. In the 1150s, tax revenues from farms diminished. The soldiers revolted and wreaked havoc in the countryside, slowed trade, and diminished the power and authority of the Fatimid caliphs.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 158.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1160s, Fatimid Egypt came under threat from [[Crusades|European crusaders]]. Out of this threat, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general named [[Saladin|\u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb]] (Saladin), with a small band of professional soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured Jerusalem]] in 1187. On the death of [[Al-Adid]], the last Fatimid caliph, in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the [[Ayyubid Dynasty]]. Under his rule, Egypt returned to [[Sunni Islam]], [[Cairo]] became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from Turkey and southern Russia for military service. Support for the military was tied to the ''iqta'', a form of land taxation in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nOver time, Mamluk slave soldiers became a very powerful [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], to the point of getting rid of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]]. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as ''[[Emir|amirs]]''. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in 1260 at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. Eventually the ''iqta'' system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their ''iqta'' as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of [[handgun]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Egypt was easily defeated. In 1517, at the end of an [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War]], Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Istanbul]] government revived the ''iqta'' system. Trade was reestablished in the Red Sea, but it could not completely connect with the [[Indian Ocean]] trade because of growing Portuguese presence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, hereditary Mamluks regained power. The leading Mamluks were referred to as ''[[bey]]s''. [[Pasha]]s, or viceroys, represented the Istanbul government in name only, operating independently. During the 18th century, dynasties of pashas became established. The government was weak and corrupt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 161.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Napoleon]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invaded Egypt]]. The local forces had little ability to resist the French conquest. However, the [[British Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire were able to remove French occupation in 1801. These events marked the beginning of a 19th-century Anglo-Franco rivalry over Egypt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 162.</ref>\n\n=====Sudan=====\n{{Main|History of Sudan}}\n\n====Christian and Islamic Nubia====\n{{Main|Nubia#Christian Nubia|Nubia#Islamic Nubia}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of Makuria}}\n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|right|250px|Christian Nubia and the Nile [[cataract]]s]]\nAfter [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana of Aksum]] sacked [[Meroe]], people associated with the site of [[Ballana]] moved into [[Nubia]] from the southwest and founded three kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Makuria|Makuria]], [[Nobatia]], and [[Alodia]]. They would rule for 200 years. Makuria was above the [[Cataracts of the Nile|third cataract]], along the Dongola Reach with its capital at [[Dongola]]. Nobadia was to the north with its capital at [[Faras]], and [[Alodia]] was to the south with its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. Makuria eventually absorbed Nobadia. The people of the region converted to [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christianity]] around 500 to 600 CE. The church initially started writing in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], then in [[Greek language|Greek]], and finally in [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]], a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. The church was aligned with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]].<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 67</ref><ref>Ehret (2002), p. 305.</ref>\n\nBy 641, [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. This effectively blocked Christian Nubia and Aksum from Mediterranean Christendom. In 651\u2013652, Arabs from Egypt invaded Christian Nubia. Nubian archers soundly defeated the invaders. The [[Bakt|Baqt (or Bakt) Treaty]] was drawn, recognizing Christian Nubia and regulating trade. The treaty controlled relations between Christian Nubia and Islamic Egypt for almost six hundred years.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nBy the 13th century, Christian Nubia began its decline. The authority of the monarchy was diminished by the church and nobility. Arab [[bedouin]] tribes began to infiltrate Nubia, causing further havoc. ''[[Fakir]]s'' (holy men) practicing [[Sufism]] introduced Islam into Nubia. By 1366, Nubia had become divided into petty fiefdoms when it was invaded by [[Mamluk]]s. During the 15th century, Nubia was open to Arab immigration. Arab nomads intermingled with the population and introduced the [[Arab culture]] and the [[Arabic]] language. By the 16th century, [[Makuria]] and [[Nobadia]] had been [[Islamization|Islamized]]. During the 16th century, Abdallah Jamma headed an Arab confederation that destroyed Soba, capital of Alodia, the last holdout of Christian Nubia. Later Alodia would fall under the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate]].<ref>Collins and Burns 2007, p. 77.</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, [[Funj people|Funj]] herders migrated north to [[Alodia]] and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at [[Sennar]] under [[Badi II|Badi II Abu Daqn]] (c. 1644\u20131680). By the end of the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They pushed their empire westward to [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]]. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under [[Badi IV]] (1724\u20131762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1805\u20131849), Pasha of Egypt.<ref>Page, Willie F.(2001).

The state arose in the 12th century CE. Its wealth came from controlling the trade in ivory from the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo Valley]], copper from the mountains of northern [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], and gold from the [[Zimbabwe]] Plateau between the Limpopo and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers, with the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants at [[Chibuene]]. By the mid-13th century, Mapungubwe was abandoned.<ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002). p. 252.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of Mapungubwe, [[Great Zimbabwe]] rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. ''Zimbabwe'' means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and was the center of an empire, consolidating lesser [[Shona people|Shona]] polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili Kilwa and [[Sofala]]. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town [[Ingombe Ilede]].<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref><ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\">Shillington (2005), pp. 147\u2013153.</ref>\n\nA new chapter of Shona history ensued. Nyatsimba Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through [[Mozambique]] to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire ''Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah'' or ''mwanamutapa'' (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. ''Monomotapa'' was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: [[Torwa dynasty|Torwa]] in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the ''mwanamutapa'' line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the [[Kingdom of Butua]] with its capital at [[Khami]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\"/><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\">Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa Empire]] continued in the north under the ''mwenemutapa'' line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet ''mwanamutapa'' named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese. The Portuguese were successful in destroying the ''mwanamutapa'' system of government and undermining trade. By 1667, Mutapa was in decay. Chiefs would not allow digging for gold because of fear of Portuguese theft, and the population declined.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Butua]] was ruled by a ''changamire'', a title derived from the founder, Changa. Later it became the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Portuguese tried to gain a foothold but were thrown out of the region in 1693, by Changamire Dombo. The 17th century was a period of peace and prosperity. The Rozwi Empire fell into ruins in the 1830s from invading [[Nguni people|Nguni]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]].<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\"/>\n\n====Namibia====\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n[[File:Realnam.JPG|thumb|250px|Herero and Nama territories]]\nBy 1500 AD, most of southern Africa had established states. In northwestern [[Namibia]], the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] engaged in farming and the [[Herero people|Herero]] engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]], expanded to [[Ghanzi]] in northwestern [[Botswana]]. The [[Nama people|Nama]], a [[Khoisan languages|Khoi-speaking]], sheep-raising group, moved northward and came into contact with the Herero; this would set the stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding [[Lozi people|Lozi]] states pushed the [[Mbukushu]], [[Kuhane language|Subiya]], and Yei to Botei, [[Kavango Region|Okavango]], and [[Chobe District|Chobe]] in northern Botswana.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 218.</ref>\n\n====South Africa and Botswana====\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa|History of South Africa|History of Botswana}}\n\n=====Sotho\u2013Tswana=====\nThe development of [[Sotho\u2013Tswana peoples|Sotho\u2013Tswana]] states based on the [[highveld]], south of the [[Limpopo River]], began around 1000 CE. The chief's power rested on cattle and his connection to the ancestor. This can be seen in the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] settlements with stone foundations and stone walls, north of the highveld and south of the [[Vaal River]]. Northwest of the Vaal River developed early [[Tswana people|Tswana]] states centered on towns of thousands of people. When disagreements or rivalry arose, different groups moved to form their own states.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\">Shillington (2005), pp. 153\u2013155.</ref>\n\n=====Nguni peoples=====\n[[File:Realzulu.JPG|thumb|250px|South African ethnic groups]]\nSoutheast of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains lived [[Nguni languages|Nguni-speaking]] peoples ([[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Swazi people|Swazi]], and [[South Ndebele people|Ndebele]]). They too engaged in state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later became known as the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (Sotho). Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the [[Zulu Kingdom]].<ref>Worden, Nigel. The Making of Modern South Africa, Oxford UK/Cambridge USA: Blackwell Publishers, 1995, p. 13.</ref> They were metalworkers, cultivators of millet, and cattle herders.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\n=====Khoisan and Boers=====\n[[File:SouthAfrica1885.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Political map of Southern Africa in 1885]]\nThe [[Khoisan]] lived in the southwestern [[Cape Province]], where winter rainfall is plentiful. Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by [[Bantu peoples]], such as the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]], but the [[Bantu expansion]] stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some [[Bantu languages]] have incorporated the [[click consonant]] of the [[Khoisan languages]]. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\nBy the 16th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a replenishing station at [[Table Bay]] for restocking water and purchasing meat from the [[Khoikhoi]]. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch established a permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew fresh fruit and vegetables and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided to increase the number of farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher ''[[boer]]s'' (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first [[Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars|Khoikhoi-Dutch war]] in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a \"[[right of conquest]]\" by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673\u20131677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 210\u2013213.</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, the cape colony had grown, with slaves coming from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Indonesia]]. The settlement also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and [[guerrilla warfare]] slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice pastoralism were known as ''[[trekboer]]s''. A common source of ''trekboer'' labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had been killed.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\n===Southeast Africa===\n{{Main|Southeast Africa#History}}\n\n====Prehistory====\nAccording to the theory of [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the mainstream position held within the scientific community, all humans originate from either [[Southeast Africa]] or the [[Horn of Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Hua|last2=Prugnolle|first2=Franck|last3=Manica|first3=Andrea|authorlink4=Francois Balloux|last4=Balloux|first4=Fran\u00e7ois|title=A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=August 2006|volume=79|issue=2|pages=230\u2013237|doi=10.1086/505436|pmid=16826514|pmc=1559480}}</ref> During the first millennium CE, [[Nilotic]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples [[Bantu expansion|moved into the region]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Swahili coast====\n{{Main|Swahili coast#History}}\n[[File:Swahili door Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A traditional Zanzibari-style [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coast door in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nFollowing the Bantu Migration, on the coastal section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu community developed through contact with [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African [[Swahili Coast|Swahili City States]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James De Vere Allen|title=Swahili origins: Swahili culture & the Shungwaya phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D5yAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=J.

The culture's earliest dated artifacts are located in the [[Kagera Region]] of [[Tanzania]], and it extended as far west as the [[Kivu]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], as far east as the [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] and [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]] provinces of [[Kenya]], and north into [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]. Sites from the Urewe culture date from the Early Iron Age, from the 5th century BC to the 6th century AD.\n\nThe origins of the Urewe culture are ultimately in the [[Bantu expansion]] originating in Cameroon. Research into early Iron Age civilizations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has been undertaken concurrently with studies on African linguistics on Bantu expansion. The Urewe culture may correspond to the Eastern subfamily of Bantu languages, spoken by the descendants of the first wave of Bantu peoples to settle East Africa. At first sight, Urewe seems to be a fully developed civilization recognizable through its distinctive, stylish earthenware and highly technical and sophisticated iron working techniques. Given our current level of knowledge, neither seems to have developed or altered for nearly 2,000 years. However, minor local variations in the ceramic ware can be observed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nUrewe is the name of the site in Kenya brought to prominence through the publication in 1948 of [[Mary Leakey]]'s archaeological findings.

The Austronesians introduced [[banana]] and [[rice]] cultivation, and the Bantu speakers introduced cattle and other farming practices. About the year 1000, Arab and Indian trade settlement were started in northern Madagascar to exploit the Indian Ocean trade.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 135.</ref> By the 14th century, [[Islam]] was introduced on the island by traders.

[[Radama I of Madagascar|Radama I]] (1810\u20131828) invited Christian [[Missionary|missionaries]] in the early 19th century. Queen [[Ranavalona I]] \"the Cruel\" (1828\u20131861) banned the practice of [[Christianity]] in the kingdom, and an estimated 150,000 Christians perished. Under [[Radama II of Madagascar|Radama II]] (1861\u20131863), Madagascar took a French orientation, with great commercial concession given to the French. In 1895, in the second [[Franco-Hova War]], the French invaded Madagascar, taking over [[Antsiranana]] (Diego Suarez) and declaring Madagascar a [[protectorate]].<ref name=\"Lye, Keith2002. pp. 242,243\"/>\n\n====Lake Plateau states and empires====\n{{Main|History of Buganda|Karagwe District#History}}\nBetween the 14th and 15th centuries, large Southeast African kingdoms and states emerged, such as the [[Buganda]]<ref name=\"Roland Oliver 1800. pp. 24-25\">Roland Oliver, et al. \"Africa South of the Equator\", in Africa Since 1800.

Cattle herding, cereal growing, and banana cultivation were the economic mainstays of these states. The [[Ntusi]] and [[Bigo]] earthworks are representative of one of the first states, the [[Bunyoro kingdom]], which oral tradition stipulates was part of the [[Empire of Kitara]] that dominated the whole Lakes region. A [[Luo peoples|Luo]] ethnic elite, from the Bito clan, ruled over the [[Bantu languages|Bantu-speaking]] [[Nyoro people]].

Kato Kintu may have migrated to the northwest of [[Lake Victoria]] as early as 1000 BC. Buganda was ruled by the ''[[Kabaka of Buganda|kabaka]]'' with a ''bataka'' composed of the clan heads. Over time, the ''kabakas'' diluted the authority of the ''bataka'', with Buganda becoming a centralized monarchy. By the 16th century, Buganda was engaged in expansion but had a serious rival in [[Bunyoro]]. By the 1870s, Buganda was a wealthy nation-state. The ''kabaka'' ruled with his ''Lukiko'' (council of ministers). Buganda had a naval fleet of a hundred vessels, each manned by thirty men. Buganda supplanted Bunyoro as the most important state in the region. However, by the early 20th century, Buganda became a province of the British [[Uganda Protectorate]].<ref>Lye, Keith (2002). pp. 121\u2013122.</ref>\n\n=====Rwanda=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Rwanda#Pre-colonization}}\nSoutheast of Bunyoro, near [[Lake Kivu]] at the bottom of the western rift, the [[Kingdom of Rwanda]] was founded, perhaps during the 17th century. [[Tutsi]] (BaTutsi) pastoralists formed the elite, with a king called the ''[[mwami]]''. The [[Hutu]] (BaHutu) were farmers. Both groups spoke the same language, but there were strict social norms against marrying each other and interaction. According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded by Mwami Ruganzu II (Ruganzu Ndori) (c. 1600\u20131624), with his capital near [[Kigali]]. It took 200 years to attain a truly centralized kingdom under Mwami [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli IV]] (Kigeri Rwabugiri) (1840\u20131895). Subjugation of the Hutu proved more difficult than subduing the Tutsi. The last Tutsi chief gave up to Mwami [[Mutara II of Rwanda|Mutara II]] (Mutara Rwogera) (1802\u20131853) in 1852, but the last Hutu holdout was conquered in the 1920s by Mwami [[Yuhi V of Rwanda|Yuhi V]] (Yuli Musinga) (1896\u20131931).<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n\n=====Burundi=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi#History}}\n{{Further|List of Kings of Burundi}}\nSouth of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the [[Burundian monarchy|Kingdom of Burundi]].

Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and political innovations. Under Mwami [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba|Ntare Rugaamba]] (c. 1795\u20131852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one based more on diplomacy than force.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Maravi====\n{{Main|Maravi}}\n[[File:Maravi Kingdom map c. 1650s.svg|thumb|right|120px|Maravi Kingdom]]\nThe [[Maravi]] claimed descent from Karonga (''kalonga''), who took that title as king. The Maravi connected Central Africa to the east coastal trade, with [[Swahili people|Swahili]] Kilwa. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between [[Lake Malawi]] and the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]]. The ''karonga'' was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the [[Shona people|Shona]] in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, he turned on the Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcomed back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura.

Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer [[Al-Farazi]] in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the ''Ghana'' (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the ''Ghana.'' The ''Ghana'' was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the whole society. Ghana converted to [[Islam]] around 1050, after conquering [[Aoudaghost]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe Ghana Empire grew wealthy by taxing the [[trans-Saharan trade]] that linked [[Tiaret]] and [[Sijilmasa]] to Aoudaghost. Ghana controlled access to the goldfields of [[Bambouk]], southeast of [[Koumbi Saleh]]. A percentage of salt and gold going through its territory was taken. The empire was not involved in production.<ref>Iliffe, John(2007). pp. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\nBy the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It was once thought that the sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several alternative explanations are cited. One important reason is the transfer of the gold trade east to the [[Niger River]] and the [[Taghaza]] Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited is political instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 83.</ref>\nThe empire came to an end in 1230, when [[Takrur]] in northern [[Senegal]] took over the capital.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\">Davidson (1991), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml The Story of Africa| BBC World Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=====Mali=====\n{{Main|Mali Empire#Pre-imperial Mali}}\n{{Further|Keita Dynasty}}\n[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|250px|Mali Empire at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Mali Empire]] began in the 13th century AD, when a [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] (Mandingo) leader, [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]] (Lord Lion) of the Keita clan, defeated [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]], king of the [[Susu people|Sosso]] or southern [[Soninke people|Soninke]], at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. Sundiata continued his conquest from the fertile forests and Niger Valley, east to the Niger Bend, north into the Sahara, and west to the Atlantic Ocean, absorbing the remains of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata took on the title of ''[[Mansa (title)|mansa]]''. He established the capital of his empire at [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nAlthough the salt and gold trade continued to be important to the Mali Empire, agriculture and pastoralism was also critical. The growing of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and rice was a vital function. On the northern borders of the [[Sahel]], grazing cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were major activities. Mande society was organize around the village and land. A cluster of villages was called a ''kafu'', ruled by a ''farma''. The ''farma'' paid tribute to the ''mansa''. A dedicated army of elite cavalry and infantry maintained order, commanded by the royal court. A formidable force could be raised from tributary regions, if necessary.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nConversion to [[Islam]] was a gradual process. The power of the ''mansa'' depended on upholding traditional beliefs and a spiritual foundation of power. Sundiata initially kept Islam at bay. Later ''mansas'' were devout Muslims but still acknowledged traditional [[Deity|deities]] and took part in traditional rituals and festivals, which were important to the Mande. Islam became a court religion under Sundiata's son [[Uli I of Mali|Uli I]] (1225\u20131270). ''Mansa'' Uli made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], becoming recognized within the Muslim world. The court was staffed with literate Muslims as secretaries and accountants. Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] left vivid descriptions of the empire.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nMali reached the peak of its power and extent in the 14th century, when [[Musa I of Mali|''Mansa'' Musa]] (1312\u20131337) made his famous ''[[hajj]]'' to Mecca with 500 slaves, each holding a bar of gold worth 500 mitqals.<ref>Davidson, Basil (1971), ''Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms'', p. 83. New York City: [[Time Life|Time Life Books]]. [[Library of Congress]] 66-25647.</ref> ''Mansa'' Musa's ''hajj'' devalued gold in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] for a decade. He made a great impression on the minds of the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like [[Al Sahili|Ishal al-Tuedjin]] (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nThe Mali Empire saw an expansion of learning and [[literacy]]. In 1285, [[Sakura (mansa)|Sakura]], a [[Freedman|freed slave]], usurped the throne. This ''mansa'' drove the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] out of [[Timbuktu]] and established it as a center of learning and commerce. The book trade increased, and book copying became a very respectable and profitable profession. Timbuktu and [[Djenn\u00e9]] became important centers of learning within the Islamic world.<ref>Davidson (1971), pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleyman]] (1341\u20131360), Mali began its spiral downward. [[Mossi people|Mossi]] cavalry raided the exposed southern border. Tuareg harassed the northern border in order to retake Timbuktu. [[Fula people|Fulani]] (Fulbe) eroded Mali's authority in the west by establishing the independent [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], a successor to the kingdom of [[Takrur]]. [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof Empire|Wolof]] alliances were broken. In 1545 to 1546, the [[Songhai Empire]] took [[Niani, Mali Empire|Niani]]. After 1599, the empire lost the [[Bambouk]] goldfields and disintegrated into petty polities.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\n=====Songhai=====\n{{Main|Songhai Empire#History}}\n{{Further|Askiya Dynasty|Sonni Dynasty}}\n[[File:SONGHAI empire map.PNG|thumb|right|250px|The Songhai Empire, c. 1500]]\nThe [[Songhai people]] are descended from fishermen on the [[Niger River|Middle Niger River]].

The Songhai speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 87.</ref>\n\n[[Sonni Ali]], a Songhai, began his conquest by capturing [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 from the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. He extended the empire to the north, deep into the desert, pushed the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] further south of the Niger, and expanded southwest to Djenne. His army consisted of cavalry and a fleet of canoes. Sonni Ali was not a Muslim, and he was portrayed negatively by Berber-Arab scholars, especially for attacking Muslim Timbuktu. After his death in 1492, his heirs were deposed by General [[Askia Mohammad I|Muhammad Ture]], a Muslim of Soninke origins<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ture (1493\u20131528) founded the [[Askiya Dynasty]], ''[[askiya]]'' being the title of the king. He consolidated the conquests of Sonni Ali. Islam was used to extend his authority by declaring [[jihad]] on the Mossi, reviving the trans-Saharan trade, and having the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph]] in Cairo declare him as caliph of Sudan. He established Timbuktu as a great center of Islamic learning. Muhammad Ture expanded the empire by pushing the Tuareg north, capturing A\u00efr in the east, and capturing salt-producing [[Taghaza]]. He brought the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa states]] into the Songhay trading network. He further centralized the administration of the empire by selecting administrators from loyal servants and families and assigning them to conquered territories. They were responsible for raising local militias. Centralization made Songhay very stable, even during dynastic disputes. [[Leo Africanus]] left vivid descriptions of the empire under Askiya Muhammad. Askiya Muhammad was deposed by his son in 1528. After much rivalry, Muhammad Ture's last son [[Askia Daoud|Askiya Daoud]] (1529\u20131582) assumed the throne.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 88.</ref>\n\nIn 1591, [[Morocco]] invaded the Songhai Empire under [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] in order to secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the [[Battle of Tondibi]], the Songhai army was defeated. The Moroccans captured Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at [[Dendi Kingdom|Dendi]] in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of the Moroccans, who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.\n\nMorocco found its venture unprofitable. The gold trade had been diverted to Europeans on the coast. Most of the trans-Saharan trade was now diverted east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. Expensive equipment purchased with gold had to be sent across the Sahara, an unsustainable scenario. The Moroccans who remained married into the population and were referred to as ''[[Arma people|Arma]]'' or ''Ruma''. They established themselves at Timbuktu as a military caste with various fiefs, independent from Morocco. Amid the chaos, other groups began to assert themselves, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] of [[Futa Tooro]] who encroached from the west. The [[Bambara Empire]], one of the states that broke from Songhai, sacked Gao.

By the 14th century CE, they had converted to [[Islam]]. During the 16th century, they established themselves at [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] in southern [[Mali]]. During the 1670s, they declared [[jihad]]s on non-Muslims. Several states were formed from these jihadist wars, at Futa Toro, Futa Djallon, Macina, [[Oualia]], and Bundu.

During the 13th century, when the gold mines in modern-day [[Mali]] started to dry up, Bonoman and later other Akan states began to rise to prominence as the major players in the Gold trade. It was [[Bonoman]] and other Akan kingdoms like [[Denkyira]], [[Akyem]], [[Akwamu]] which were the predecessors to what became the all-powerful [[Empire of Ashanti]]. When and how the Ashante got to their present location is debatable. What is known is that by the 17th century an Akan people were identified as living in a state called Kwaaman. The location of the state was north of Lake Bosomtwe. The state's revenue was mainly derived from trading in gold and [[kola nut]]s and clearing forest to plant [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They built towns between the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra]] and [[Ofin]] rivers. They formed alliances for defense and paid tribute to [[Denkyira]] one of the more powerful Akan states at that time along with Adansi and [[Akwamu]]. During the 16th century, Ashante society experienced sudden changes, including population growth because of cultivation of [[New World]] plants such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]] and an increase in the gold trade between the coast and the north.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\nBy the 17th century, [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]] (c. 1695\u20131717), with help of [[Okomfo Anokye]], unified what became the Ashante into a confederation with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] as a symbol of their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akwamu]], introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch. [[Opoku Ware I]] (1720\u20131745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding [[Techiman]], Banda, [[Gyaaman]], and [[Gonja people|Gonja]], states on the [[Black Volta]]. Between 1744 and 1745, ''Asantehene'' Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. [[Kusi Obodom]] (1750\u20131764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. [[Osei Kwadwo]] (1777\u20131803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. [[Osei Kwame Panyin]] (1777\u20131803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804\u20131807), and Osei Bonsu (1807\u20131824) continued territorial consolidation and expansion.

He was assisted at the capital, Kumasi, by a civil service of men talented in trade, diplomacy, and the military, with a head called the ''Gyaasehene''. Men from Arabia, Sudan, and Europe were employed in the civil service, all of them appointed by the ''ashantehene''. At the capital and in other towns, the ''ankobia'' or special police were used as bodyguards to the ''ashantehene'', as sources of intelligence, and to suppress rebellion. Communication throughout the empire was maintained via a network of well-kept roads from the coast to the middle Niger and linking together other trade cities.<ref>Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the Ashante Empire remained powerful.

King [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645\u20131685) organized Dahomey into a powerful centralized state. He declared all lands to be owned of the king and subject to taxation. [[Primogeniture]] in the kingship was established, neutralizing all input from village chiefs. A \"cult of kingship\" was established. A captive slave would be sacrificed annually to honor the royal ancestors. During the 1720s, the slave-trading states of [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]] and [[Allada]] were taken, giving Dahomey direct access to the slave coast and trade with Europeans. King [[Agadja]] (1708\u20131740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on [[firearm]]s were too great. In 1730, under king Agaja, Dahomey was conquered by the [[Oyo Empire]], and Dahomey had to pay tribute. Taxes on slaves were mostly paid in cowrie shells. During the 19th century, palm oil was the main trading commodity.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 191\u2013192.</ref> [[French colonial empire|France]] conquered Dahomey during the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] (1892\u20131894) and established a colonial government there.

The name comes from a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word to refer to the [[Oyo Empire]]. The first Yoruba state was [[Ife|Ile-Ife]], said to have been founded around 1000 AD by a supernatural figure, the first ''oni'' [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different city-states of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba ''obas'', or kings. Yoruba city-states were usually governed by an ''oba'' and an ''iwarefa'', a council of chiefs who advised the ''oba.'' by the 18th century, the Yoruba city-states formed a loose confederation, with the ''Oni'' of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual city-states became more powerful with their ''obas'' assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the ''Oni'' of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the city-states.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 131\u2013132.</ref>\n\nThe Oyo Empire rose in the 16th century. The Oyo state had been conquered in 1550 by the kingdom of [[Nupe people|Nupe]], which was in possession of cavalry, an important tactical advantage. The ''alafin'' (king) of Oyo was sent into exile. After returning, ''Alafin'' [[Orompoto]] (c. 1560\u20131580) built up an army based on heavily armed cavalry and long-service troops. This made them invincible in combat on the northern grasslands and in the thinly wooded forests. By the end of the 16th century, Oyo had added the western region of the Niger to the hills of Togo, the Yoruba of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], Dahomey, and the Fon nation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA governing council served the empire, with clear executive divisions. Each acquired region was assigned a local administrator. Families served in king-making capacities. Oyo, as a northern Yoruba kingdom, served as middle-man in the north\u2013south trade and connecting the eastern forest of [[Guinea]] with the western and central [[Sahel|Sudan]], the Sahara, and North Africa. The Yoruba manufactured cloth, ironware, and pottery, which were exchanged for salt, leather, and most importantly horses from the Sudan to maintain the cavalry. Oyo remained strong for two hundred years.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\"/><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 134.</ref> It became a protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in 1888, before further fragmenting into warring factions.

It was engaged in political expansion and consolidation from its very beginning. Under ''Oba'' (king) [[Ewuare]] (c. 1450\u20131480 AD), the state was organized for conquest. He solidified central authority and initiated 30 years of war with his neighbors. At his death, the Benin Empire extended to [[Dahomey]] in the west, to the [[Niger Delta]] in the east, along the west African coast, and to the Yoruba towns in the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nEwuare's grandson ''Oba'' [[Esigie]] (1504\u20131550) eroded the power of the ''uzama'' (state council) and increased contact and trade with Europeans, especially with the Portuguese who provided a new source of copper for court art.\nThe ''oba'' ruled with the advice of the ''uzama'', a council consisting of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power.

By the early 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast.

These city-states were protected by the waterways and thick vegetation of the delta. The region was transformed by trade in the 17th century. The delta's city-states were comparable to those of the [[Swahili people]] in East Africa. Some, like [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Kalabari Kingdom|Kalabari]], and [[Kingdom of Warri|Warri]], had kings. Others, like [[Brass, Nigeria|Brass]], were republics with small senates, and those at [[Cross River State|Cross River]] and [[Calabar|Old Calabar]] were ruled by merchants of the ''ekpe'' society. The ''ekpe'' society regulated trade and made rules for members known as house systems. Some of these houses, like the Pepples of Bonny, were well known in the Americas and Europe.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\nThe [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lived east of the delta (but with the [[Anioma]] on the west of the Niger River). The [[Kingdom of Nri]] rose in the 9th century, with the ''Eze'' Nri being its leader. It was a political entity composed of villages, and each village was autonomous and independent with its own territory and name, each recognized by its neighbors. Villages were democratic with all males and sometimes females a part of the decision-making process.

[[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] competed for guns and ammunition, providing cattle, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The Germans were more firmly established than the British in the region. By 1884, the [[German colonial empire|Germans]] declared the coastal region from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Cunene River|Kunene River]] a German protectorate, part of [[German South West Africa]]. They pursued an aggressive policy of land expansion for white settlements. They exploited rivalry between the Nama and Herero.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327\u2013329, 340\u2013342.</ref>\n\nThe Herero entered into an alliance with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]] rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, [[rinderpest]] crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and even trying to export Herero labor to South Africa.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the Herero rebelled. German General [[Lothar von Trotha]] implemented an [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|extermination policy]] at the [[Battle of Waterberg]], which drove the Herero west of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. At the end of 1905, only 16,000 Herero were alive, out of a previous population of 80,000. Nama resistance was crushed in 1907. All Nama and Herero cattle and land were confiscated from the very diminished population, with remaining Nama and Herero assuming a subordinate position. Labor had to be imported from among the Ovambo.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327.</ref>\n\n===Nguniland===\n{{Main|Nguni people#History}}\n[[File:Dance of Landeens.jpg|thumb|250px|Zulu warriors]]\nA moment of great disorder in southern Africa was the ''[[Mfecane]]'', \"the crushing.\" It was started by the northern Nguni kingdoms of [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]], [[Ndwandwe]], and [[Swaziland]] over scarce resource and famine. When [[Dingiswayo]] of Mthethwa died, [[Shaka]] of the Zulu people took over. He established the [[Zulu Kingdom]], asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the Swazi north. The scattering Ndwandwe and Swazi caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid as far south as the [[Tugela River|Tugela]] and [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]] rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with ''indunas'', responsible to him. He introduced a centralized, dedicated, and disciplined military force not seen in the region, with a new weapon in the short stabbing-spear.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257, 270.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half brother [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]], who lacked the military genius and leadership skills of Shaka. [[Voortrekkers]] tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In the early months they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the [[Blood River|Ncome River]] and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers dared not settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother [[Mpande]] took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 [[Anglo-Zulu War|the Zulu Kingdom was invaded]] by Britain in a quest to control all of [[South Africa]]. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] but was defeated at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257.</ref><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\">Davidson (1991), pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nOne of the major states to emerge from the [[Mfecane]] was the [[Lesotho|Sotho Kingdom]] founded at [[Thaba Bosiu]] by [[Moshoeshoe I]] around 1821 to 1822. It was a [[confederation]] of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the [[Cape Province|Cape]]. The [[Orange Free State]] slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of [[Basutoland]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 261\u2013262, 271.</ref>\n\n===Sotho-Tswana===\n{{Main|Sotho people#History|Tswana people#History}}\nThe arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the [[Vaal River]] to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold, and rhinoceros horn.\nThe first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823\u20131843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and Amandebele raided repeatedly, and took large numbers of cattle, women, and children from the Batswana\u2014most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/botswana/history-and-culture|title=Botswana \u2013 History and Culture|website=www.iexplore.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html|title=Culture of Botswana \u2013 history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the [[Tswapong people|Batswapong]] and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions, and after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|date=1991-01-01|title=The Batswana-Boer War of 1852\u201353: how the Batswana achieved victory|url=https://journals.co.za/content/botnotes/23/1/AJA052550590_916|journal=Botswana Notes & Records|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>\nIn the 1820s, refugees from the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] expansion under [[Shaka]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref> came into contact with the Basotho people residing on the highveld.\nIn 1823, those pressures caused one group of Basotho, the [[Makololo|Kololo]], to migrate north, past the [[Okavango Swamp]] and across the [[Zambezi]] into Barotseland, now part of [[Zambia]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Muimui, Lubosi|title=Political History of Barotseland|url=http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423171845/http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archivedate=23 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Phiri, Bizeck J.|year=2005|editor=Shillington, Kevin|title=Lozi Kingdom and the Kololo|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume II, H\u2013O|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn (Routledge)|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&pg=PA851 851\u2013852]|isbn=978-1-57958-454-2}}</ref>\n\nAt about the same time, the [[Boers]] began to encroach upon Basotho territory.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\">{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}.</ref> After the [[Cape Colony]] had been ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the ''[[voortrekker]]s'' (\"pioneers\") were farmers who opted to leave the former Dutch colony and moved inland where they eventually established independent polities.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\"/><ref name=\"Thompson 2001\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first= L. |year=2001|title= A History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf00thom_0|url-access=registration|publisher= Yale University Press|location= Cambridge}}.</ref>\n\nAt the time of these developments, [[Moshoeshoe I]] gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the southern Highveld.<ref name=\"Thompson 2001\"/> Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he was able to wield the disparate refugee groups escaping the [[Difaqane]] into a cohesive nation.<ref>Becker, P.

The Khoikhoi had lost economic and political independence and had been absorbed into Boer society. The Boers spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language or dialect derived from Dutch, and no longer called themselves Boers but [[Afrikaners]]. Some Khoikhoi were used as [[commando]]s in raids against other Khoikhoi and later Xhosa. A mixed Khoi, slave, and European population called the [[Cape Coloureds]], who were outcasts within colonial society, also arose.

Unlike the Khoisan, the Bantu states were not conquered by the Afrikaners, because of population density and greater unity. Additionally, they began to arm themselves with guns acquired through trade at the cape. In some cases, as in the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa/Boer Wars]], Boers were removed from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] lands. It required a dedicated imperial military force to subdue the Bantu-speaking states. In 1901, the Boer republics were defeated by Britain in the [[Second Boer War]].

For 400 years, European nations had mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that did, like the Portuguese, often met defeats and had to retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of [[repeating rifle]]s, which were easier and quicker to load than [[musket]]s. [[Artillery]] was being used increasingly. In 1885, [[Hiram S. Maxim]] developed the [[maxim gun]], the model of the modern-day [[machine gun]]. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 268\u2013269.</ref>\n\nAfrican germs took numerous European lives and deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], and [[leprosy]] made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans.

In 1854, the discovery of [[quinine]] and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 269.</ref>\n\nStrong motives for conquest of Africa were at play. Raw materials were needed for European factories. Europe in the early part of the 19th century was undergoing its [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nationalist rivalries and prestige were at play.

It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation. In a series of treaties in 1890\u20131891, colonial boundaries were completely drawn. All of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was claimed by European powers, except for Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe European powers set up a variety of different administrations in Africa, reflecting different ambitions and degrees of power. In some areas, such as parts of [[British West Africa]], colonial control was tenuous and intended for simple economic extraction, strategic power, or as part of a long-term development plan. In other areas, Europeans were encouraged to settle, creating settler states in which a European minority dominated. Settlers only came to a few colonies in sufficient numbers to have a strong impact. British settler colonies included [[British East Africa]] (now Kenya), [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], ([[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively), and [[South Africa]], which already had a significant population of European settlers, the [[Boer]]s.

They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere. Across Africa the powerful new force of [[nationalism]] drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S.

Darstellung von Carl Arriens.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ngomano]] in November 1917]]\nWith the vast majority of the continent under the colonial control of European governments, the World Wars were significant events in the geopolitical history of Africa.  Africa was a theater of war and saw fighting in both wars.  More important in most regions, the [[total war]] footing of colonial powers impacted the governance of African colonies, through resource allocation, conscription, and taxation.  In [[World War I]] there were several campaigns in Africa, including the [[Togoland Campaign]], the [[Kamerun Campaign]], the [[South West Africa campaign]], and the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]].  In each, Allied forces, primarily British, but also French, Belgian, South African, and Portuguese, sought to force the Germans out of their African colonies.  In each, German forces were badly outnumbered and, due to Allied naval superiority, were cut off from reinforcement or resupply.  The Allies eventually conquered all German colonies; German forces in East Africa managed to avoid surrender throughout the war, though they could not hold any territory after 1917. After World War I, [[List of former German colonies|former German colonies]] in Africa were taken over by France, Belgium, and the British Empire.\n\nAfter World War I, colonial powers continued to consolidate their control over their African territories.  In some areas, particularly in Southern and East Africa, large settler populations were successful in pressing for additional devolution of administration, so-called \"home rule\" by the white settlers.  In many cases, settler regimes were harsher on African populations, tending to see them more as a threat to political power, as opposed to colonial regimes which had generally endeavored to co-opt local populations into economic production.  The [[Great Depression]] strongly affected Africa's non-subsistence economy, much of which was based on commodity production for Western markets.  As demand increased in the late 1930s, Africa's economy rebounded as well.\n\nAfrica was the site of one of the first instances of [[fascist]] territorial expansions in the 1930s.  Italy had attempted to conquer Ethiopia in the 1890s but had been rebuffed in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].  Ethiopia lay between two Italian colonies, [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Eritrea]] and was invaded in October 1935.  With an overwhelming advantage in [[armor]] and aircraft, by May 1936, Italian forces had occupied the capital of [[Addis Ababa]] and effectively declared victory. Ethiopia and their other colonies were consolidated into [[Italian East Africa]].\n\n===World War II: Political===\n[[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|right|Areas controlled by European powers in 1939.

Vichy was in control until the Free French prevailed in late 1942. Portuguese (brown) and Spanish (teal) colonies remained neutral.]]\n\nAfrica was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major British and American campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major British campaign against Italy.  The vast geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of Africa had dominion status and was largely self-governing, the other British possessions were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British -controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources.  Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers.<ref>Ashley Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 171\u2013239.</ref><ref>David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. ''Africa and the Second World War'' (1986).</ref>\n\nBefore the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command.  It provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 175\u2013177.</ref>\n\nBefore 1939, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised under two percent of the population outside South Africa. As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army.  The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer units, with over 82,000 soldiers.. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. The volunteers did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945. There were minor episodes of discontent, but nothing serious, among the natives.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp. 180\u2013189.</ref> Afrikaner nationalism was a factor in South Africa, But the proto-German Afrikaner prime minister was replaced in 1939 by [[Jan Smuts]], an Afrikaner who was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Empire.

With the [[fall of France]] on June 25, most of France's colonies in North and West Africa were controlled by the [[Vichy government]], though much of Central Africa fell under [[Free French]] control after some fighting between Vichy and Free French forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] and the [[Battle of Gabon]]. After the fall of France, Africa was the only active theater for ground combat until the [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October.  In the [[Western Desert campaign]] Italian forces from Libya sought to overrun Egypt, controlled by the British.  Simultaneously, in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]], Italian East African forces overran [[British Somaliland]] and some British outposts in [[Kenya]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].  When Italy's efforts to conquer Egypt (including the crucial [[Suez Canal]]) and Sudan fell short, they were unable to reestablish supply to Italian East Africa. Without the ability to reinforce or resupply and surrounded by Allied possessions, Italian East Africa was conquered by mainly British and South African forces in 1941. In North Africa, the Italians soon requested help from the Germans who sent a substantial force under General [[Rommel]].  With German help, the Axis forces regained the upper hand but were unable to break through British defenses in two tries at [[El Alamein]].  In late 1942, Allied forces, mainly Americans and Canadians, invaded French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]], where Vichy French forces initially surprised them with their resistance but were convinced to stop fighting after three days.  The second front relieved pressure on the British in Egypt who began pushing west to meet up with the Torch forces, eventually pinning German and Italian forces in [[Tunisia]], which was conquered by May 1943 in the [[Tunisia campaign]], ending the war in Africa. The only other significant operations occurred in the French colony of Madagascar, which was invaded by the British in May 1942 to deny its ports to the Axis (potentially the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] who had reached the eastern Indian Ocean).  The French garrisons in Madagascar surrendered in November 1942.\n\n===Post-war Africa: decolonization===\n{{further|Historical African place names|Decolonisation of Africa|Neocolonialism}}\n[[File:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dates of independence of African countries]]\n\nThe [[decolonization of Africa]] started with [[Libya]] in 1951, although [[Liberia]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]] were already independent.

Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a decade or more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were [[Guinea-Bissau]] (1974), [[Mozambique]] (1975) and [[Angola]] (1975) from Portugal; [[Djibouti]] from France in 1977; [[Zimbabwe]] from the United Kingdom in 1980; and [[Namibia]] from South Africa in 1990.

Professional scholarship appeared around 1900, and began with the study of business operations, typically using government documents and unpublished archives.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Winks|first=Robin|title=The Oxford History of the British Empire: Volume V: Historiography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-79-924680-9|location=Oxford|pages=465}}</ref>\n\nThe economic approach was widely practiced in the 1930s, primarily to provide descriptions of the changes underway in the previous half-century. In 1935, American historian [[William L. Langer]] published ''The Diplomacy of Imperialism: 1890\u20131902'', a book that is still widely cited.

The earliest known [[recorded history]] [[Classical African civilization|arose]] in [[Ancient Egypt]], and later in [[Nubia]], the [[Sahel]], the [[Maghreb]] and the [[Horn of Africa]].\n\nFollowing the [[desertification]] of the [[Sahara]], North African history became entwined with the [[Middle East]] and [[Southern Europe]] while the [[Bantu expansion]] swept from modern day [[Cameroon]] (Central Africa) across much of the sub-Saharan continent in waves between around 1000 BC and 0 [[AD]], creating a linguistic commonality across much of the central and Southern continent.\n\nDuring the [[Middle Ages]], [[Islam]] spread west from Arabia to Egypt, crossing the Maghreb and the Sahel. Some notable pre-colonial states and societies in Africa include the [[Ajuran Empire]], [[D'mt]], [[Adal Sultanate]], [[Alodia]], Warsangali Sultanate, [[Kingdom of Nri]], [[Nok culture]], [[Mali Empire]], [[Songhai Empire]], [[Benin Empire]], [[Oyo Empire]], [[Kingdom of Lunda (Punu-yaka)]], [[Ashanti Empire]], [[Ghana Empire]], [[Mossi Kingdoms]], [[Mutapa Empire]], [[Kingdom of Mapungubwe]], [[Kingdom of Sine]], [[Sennar (sultanate)|Kingdom of Sennar]], [[Kingdom of Saloum]], [[Kingdom of Baol]], Kingdom of [[Cayor]], [[Kingdom of Zimbabwe]], [[Kingdom of Kongo]], Empire of [[Kaabu]], Kingdom of [[Ile Ife]], [[Ancient Carthage]], [[Numidia]], [[Mauretania]], and the [[Aksumite Empire]]. At its peak, prior to European [[colonialism]], it is estimated that Africa had up to 10,000 different states and autonomous groups with distinct languages and customs.<ref name=\"http://newswatch.nationalgeographic.com/2013/10/31/getting-to-know-africa-50-facts/\">Africa Information</ref>\n\nFrom the mid-7th century, the [[Arab slave trade]] saw Muslim Arabs enslave Africans. Following an armistice between the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] and the [[Kingdom of Makuria]] after the [[Second Battle of Dongola]] in 652 AD, they were transported, along with Asians and Europeans, across the [[Red Sea]], [[Indian Ocean]], and [[Sahara Desert]].\n\nFrom the late 15th century, Europeans joined the slave trade. One could say the Portuguese led in partnership with other Europeans. That includes the triangular trade, with the Portuguese initially acquiring slaves through trade and later by force as part of the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. They transported enslaved [[West Africa|West]], [[Central Africa|Central]], and [[Southern Africa|Southern]] Africans overseas.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.eyewitnesstohistory.com/slavetrade.htm |title = African Slave Trade, 1788}}</ref> Subsequently, European colonization of Africa developed rapidly from around 10% (1870) to over 90% (1914) in the [[Scramble for Africa]] (1881\u20131914).  However following struggles for independence in many parts of the continent, as well as a weakened Europe after the [[Second World War]] {{nowrap|(1939\u20131945)}}, [[decolonization]] took place across the continent, culminating in the 1960 [[Year of Africa]].\n\nDisciplines such as recording of [[oral history]], [[historical linguistics]], [[archaeology of Africa|archaeology]] and [[genetics]] have been vital in rediscovering the great African civilizations of antiquity.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n{{Human history}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{Further|Prehistoric North Africa|Sub-Saharan Africa#Prehistory|History of West Africa#Prehistory|Central Africa#Prehistory|East Africa#Prehistory|Horn of Africa#Prehistory|African archaeology}}\n\n===Paleolithic===\n{{Main|Lower Paleolithic|Middle Stone Age|Later Stone Age}}\nThe first known [[Hominidae|hominids]] evolved in Africa. According to [[paleontology]], the early hominids' skull anatomy was similar to that of the [[gorilla]] and the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]], [[great apes]] that also evolved in Africa, but the hominids had adopted a [[biped]]al locomotion which freed their hands. This gave them a crucial advantage, enabling them to live in both forested areas and on the open [[savanna]] at a time when Africa was drying up and the savanna was encroaching on forested areas. This would have occurred 10 to 5 million years ago, but these claims are controversial because biologists and genetics have humans appearing around the last 70 thousand to 200 thousand years.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), ''History of Africa'', p. 2. Rev. 2nd ed. New York: Palgrave Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-333-59957-8}}.</ref>\n\nBy 4 million years ago, several [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] hominid species had developed throughout [[Southern Africa|Southern]], [[East Africa|Eastern]] and [[Central Africa]]. They were tool users, and makers of tools. They scavenged for meat and were omnivores.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 2.</ref>\n\nBy approximately 3.3 million years ago, primitive stone tools were first used to scavenge kills made by other predators and to harvest carrion and marrow from their bones. In hunting, ''[[Homo habilis]]'' was probably not capable of competing with large predators and was still more prey than hunter. ''H. habilis'' probably did steal eggs from nests and may have been able to catch small [[game (food)|game]] and weakened larger prey (cubs and older animals). The tools were classed as [[Oldowan]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, p. 2-3\">Shillington (2005), pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\nAround 1.8 million years ago, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' first appeared in the fossil record in Africa. From ''Homo ergaster'', ''[[Homo erectus]]'' evolved 1.5 million years ago. Some of the earlier representatives of this species were still fairly small-brained and used primitive stone tools, much like ''H. habilis''. The brain later grew in size, and ''H. erectus'' eventually developed a more complex stone tool technology called the [[Acheulean]]. Possibly the first hunters, ''H. erectus'' mastered the art of making fire and was the first hominid to leave Africa, colonizing most of [[Afro-Eurasia]] and perhaps later giving rise to ''[[Homo floresiensis]]''. Although some recent writers have suggested that ''[[Homo georgicus]]'' was the first and primary hominid ever to live outside Africa, many scientists consider ''H. georgicus'' to be an early and primitive member of the ''H. erectus'' species.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 3.</ref><ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002), ''The Civilizations of Africa'', p. 22.

The regions with the largest population pressure were in the [[Nile Delta]] region of [[Lower Egypt]], in [[Upper Egypt]], and also along the [[Cataracts of the Nile|second and third cataracts]] of the [[Dongola Reach]] of the Nile in Nubia. This population pressure and growth was brought about by the cultivation of southwest Asian crops, including wheat and barley, and the raising of sheep, goats, and cattle. Population growth led to competition for farm land and the need to regulate farming. Regulation was established by the formation of [[Bureaucracy|bureaucracies]] among sacral chiefdoms. The first and most powerful of the chiefdoms was [[Ta-Seti]], founded around 3,500 BC. The idea of sacral chiefdom spread throughout Upper and Lower Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 143\u2013146.</ref>\n\n[[File:All Gizah Pyramids.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[pyramids of Giza]], symbols of the civilization of ancient Egypt]]\nLater consolidation of the chiefdoms into broader political entities began to occur in Upper and Lower Egypt, culminating into the unification of Egypt into one political entity by [[Narmer]] ([[Menes]]) in 3,100 BC. Instead of being viewed as a sacral chief, he became a [[Imperial cult|divine king]]. The [[henotheism]], or worship of a single god within a polytheistic system, practiced in the sacral chiefdoms along Upper and Lower Egypt, became the polytheistic [[Ancient Egyptian religion]]. Bureaucracies became more centralized under the [[pharaoh]]s, run by [[Vizier (Ancient Egypt)|viziers]], governors, tax collectors, generals, artists, and technicians. They engaged in tax collecting, organizing of labor for major public works, and building irrigation systems, [[pyramid]]s, temples, and canals. During the [[Fourth Dynasty of Egypt|Fourth Dynasty]] (2,620\u20132,480 BC), long distance trade was developed, with the [[Levant]] for timber, with Nubia for gold and skins, with [[Land of Punt|Punt]] for [[frankincense]], and also with the western Libyan territories. For most of the [[Old Kingdom of Egypt|Old Kingdom]], Egypt developed her fundamental systems, institutions and culture, always through the central bureaucracy and by the divinity of the [[Pharaoh]].<ref>Davidson, Basil (1991), ''Africa In History: Themes and Outlines'', pp. 30\u201333.

Then came the [[Second Intermediate Period of Egypt|Second Intermediate Period]], with the invasion of the [[Hyksos]] on horse-drawn [[chariot]]s and utilizing bronze weapons, a technology heretofore unseen in Egypt. Horse-drawn chariots soon spread to the west in the inhabitable Sahara and North Africa. The Hyksos failed to hold on to their Egyptian territories and were absorbed by Egyptian society. This eventually led to one of Egypt's most powerful phases, the [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]] (1,580\u20131,080 BC), with the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]].

It ruled for two centuries.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 30-33\"/>\n\nTo the south, Nubian independence and strength was being reasserted. This reassertion led to the conquest of Egypt by Nubia, begun by [[Kashta]] and completed by [[Piye]] (Pianhky, 751\u2013730 BC) and [[Shabaka]] (716\u2013695 BC). This was the birth of the [[Twenty-fifth Dynasty of Egypt]]. The Nubians tried to re-establish Egyptian traditions and customs. They ruled Egypt for a hundred years. This was ended by an [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian]] invasion, with [[Taharqa]] experiencing the full might of Assyrian iron weapons.

Sometime around the 18th century BC, the Kingdom of Kerma conquered the Kingdom of Sai, becoming a serious rival to Egypt.

About 1,575 to 1,550 BC, during the latter part of the [[Seventeenth Dynasty of Egypt|Seventeenth Dynasty]], the Kingdom of Kerma invaded Egypt.<ref>Alberge, Dalya. \"Tomb Reveals Ancient Egypt's Humiliating Secret\", ''The Times'' {London}, 28 July 2003.</ref> The Kingdom of Kerma allied itself with the [[Hyksos]] invasion of Egypt.<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 148\u2013151.</ref>\n\nEgypt eventually re-energized under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Eighteenth Dynasty]] and conquered the Kingdom of Kerma or [[Kingdom of Kush|Kush]], ruling it for almost 500 years. The Kushites were Egyptianized during this period. By 1100 BC, the Egyptians had withdrawn from Kush. The region regained independence and reasserted its culture. Kush built a new religion around [[Amun]] and made [[Napata]] its spiritual center. In 730 BC, the Kingdom of Kush invaded Egypt, taking over [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]] and beginning the Nubian Empire. The empire extended from [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] to the confluence of the Blue Nile, the White Nile, and River Atbara.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 40\u201341.</ref>\n\nIn 760 BC, the Kushites were expelled from Egypt by iron-wielding [[Assyria]]ns. Later, the administrative capital was moved from Napata to [[Mer\u00f6e]], developing a new Nubian culture. Initially, Meroites were highly Egyptianized, but they subsequently began to take on distinctive features. Nubia became a center of iron-making and cotton cloth manufacturing. Egyptian writing was replaced by the [[Meroitic alphabet]]. The lion god [[Apedemak]] was added to the Egyptian pantheon of gods. Trade links to the [[Red Sea]] increased, linking Nubia with Mediterranean [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Its architecture and art diversified, with pictures of lions, ostriches, giraffes, and elephants. Eventually, with the rise of [[Aksum]], Nubia's trade links were broken and it suffered environmental degradation from the tree cutting required for iron production.

In 814 BC, Phoenicians from [[Tyre, Lebanon|Tyre]] established the city of [[Carthage]]. By 600 BC, Carthage had become a major trading entity and power in the Mediterranean, largely through trade with tropical Africa. Carthage's prosperity fostered the growth of the Berber kingdoms, [[Numidia]] and [[Mauretania]]. Around 500 BC, Carthage provided a strong impetus for trade with [[Sub-Saharan Africa]]. Berber middlemen, who had maintained contacts with Sub-Saharan Africa since the desert had desiccated, utilized pack animals to transfer products from oasis to oasis. Danger lurked from the [[Garamantes]] of [[Fes|Fez]], who raided caravans.

Carthage lost the first two wars, and in the third it was destroyed, becoming the [[Africa (Roman province)|Roman province of Africa]], with the Berber Kingdom of Numidia assisting Rome. The Roman province of Africa became a major agricultural supplier of wheat, [[olive]]s, and [[olive oil]] to [[Roman Empire|imperial Rome]] via exorbitant taxation. Two centuries later, Rome brought the Berber kingdoms of Numidia and Mauretania under its authority. In the 420's AD, [[Vandal Kingdom|Vandals]] invaded North Africa and Rome lost her territories.

The Carthaginian state declined because of successive defeats by the Romans in the [[Punic Wars]]; in 146 BC the city of Carthage was destroyed. As Carthaginian power waned, the influence of Berber leaders in the hinterland grew. By the 2nd century BC, several large but loosely administered Berber kingdoms had emerged. Two of them were established in [[Numidia]], behind the coastal areas controlled by Carthage. West of Numidia lay Mauretania, which extended across the [[Moulouya River]] in Morocco to the Atlantic Ocean. The high point of Berber civilization, unequaled until the coming of the [[Almohad]]s and [[Almoravid dynasty]] more than a millennium later, was reached during the reign of [[Masinissa]] in the 2nd century BC. After Masinissa's death in 148 BC, the Berber kingdoms were divided and reunited several times. Masinissa's line survived until 24 AD, when the remaining Berber territory was annexed to the [[Roman Empire]].\n\n===Somalia===\n{{Main|History of Somalia}}\n{{Further|Maritime history of Somalia}}\n[[File:Qableh1.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Ruins of [[Qa'ableh]], an early center of [[Somali people|Somali]] civilization]]\nThe ancestors of the [[Somali people]] were an important link in the [[Horn of Africa]] connecting the region's commerce with the rest of the ancient world.

Sedentary tribes lost their autonomy and connection with the land. Berber opposition to the Roman presence was nearly constant. The [[Roman emperor]] [[Trajan]] established a frontier in the south by encircling the Aur\u00e8s and [[Nemencha]] mountains and building a line of forts from Vescera (modern [[Biskra]]) to Ad Majores ([[Hennchir Besseriani]], southeast of Biskra). The defensive line extended at least as far as Castellum Dimmidi (modern [[Messa\u00e2d]], southwest of Biskra), Roman Algeria's southernmost fort.

Starting in the 2nd century AD, these garrisons were manned mostly by local inhabitants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nAside from [[Carthage]], urbanization in North Africa came in part with the establishment of settlements of veterans under the Roman emperors [[Claudius]] (reigned 41\u201354), [[Nerva]] (96\u201398), and [[Trajan]] (98\u2013117).

The prosperity of most towns depended on [[agriculture]]. Called the \"granary of the empire\", North Africa became one of the largest exporters of grain in the empire, shipping to the provinces which did not produce cereals, like [[Roman Italy|Italy]] and [[Roman Greece|Greece]]. Other crops included fruit, figs, grapes, and beans. By the 2nd century AD, olive oil rivaled cereals as an export item.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe beginnings of the [[Historiography of the fall of the Western Roman Empire|Roman imperial decline]] seemed less serious in North Africa than elsewhere. However, uprisings did take place. In 238 AD, landowners rebelled unsuccessfully against imperial fiscal policies. Sporadic tribal revolts in the Mauretanian mountains followed from 253 to 288, during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]]. The towns also suffered economic difficulties, and building activity almost ceased.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe towns of Roman North Africa had a substantial [[History of the Jews in the Roman Empire|Jewish population]].

In addition, a number of Berber tribes had converted to [[Judaism]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nChristianity arrived in the 2nd century and soon gained converts in the towns and among slaves. More than eighty bishops, some from distant frontier regions of Numidia, attended the [[Council of Carthage (256)]] in 256. By the end of the 4th century, the settled areas had become [[Christianization|Christianized]], and some Berber tribes had converted ''en masse''.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nA division in the church that came to be known as the [[Donatism|Donatist]] [[heresy]] began in 313 among [[Christians]] in North Africa. The Donatists stressed the holiness of the church and refused to accept the authority to administer the sacraments of those who had surrendered the scriptures when they were forbidden under the Emperor [[Diocletian]] (reigned 284\u2013305). The Donatists also opposed the involvement of [[Constantine the Great]] (reigned 306\u2013337) in church affairs in contrast to the majority of Christians who welcomed official imperial recognition.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe occasionally violent Donatist controversy has been characterized{{by whom|date=December 2013}} as a struggle between opponents and supporters of the Roman system. The most articulate North African critic of the Donatist position, which came to be called a heresy, was [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], bishop of [[Hippo Regius]]. Augustine maintained that the unworthiness of a minister did not affect the validity of the sacraments because their true minister was [[Jesus]] [[Christ]]. In his sermons and books Augustine, who is considered a leading exponent of Christian dogma, evolved a theory of the right of orthodox Christian rulers to use force against schismatics and heretics. Although the dispute was resolved by a decision of an imperial commission in Carthage in 411, Donatist communities continued to exist as late as the 6th century.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA decline in trade weakened Roman control.

Local opposition delayed full Byzantine control of the region for twelve years, however, and when imperial control came, it was but a shadow of the control exercised by Rome. Although an impressive series of fortifications were built, Byzantine rule was compromised by official corruption, incompetence, military weakness, and lack of concern in Constantinople for African affairs, which made it an easy target for the Arabs during the [[Early Muslim conquests]] .

D'mt traded through the [[Red Sea]] with Egypt and the Mediterranean, providing frankincense. By the 5th and 3rd centuries, D'mt had declined, and several successor states took its place. Later there was greater trade with [[South Arabia]], mainly with the port of [[Sabaeans|Saba]]. [[Adulis]] became an important commercial center in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. The interaction of the peoples in the two regions, the southern Arabia [[Sabaeans]] and the northern Ethiopians, resulted in the [[Ge'ez]] culture and language and eventual development of the [[Ge'ez script]]. Trade links increased and expanded from the Red Sea to the Mediterranean, with Egypt, Israel, Phoenicia, Greece, and Rome, to the Black Sea, and to Persia, India, and China. Aksum was known throughout those lands. By the 5th century BC, the region was very prosperous, exporting ivory, hippopotamus hides, gold dust, spices, and live elephants. It imported silver, gold, olive oil, and wine. Aksum manufactured glass crystal, brass, and copper for export. A powerful Aksum emerged, unifying parts of eastern Sudan, northern Ethiopia ([[Tigray Region|Tigre]]), and [[Eritrea]]. Its kings built stone palatial buildings and were buried under megalithic monuments. By 300 AD, Aksum was minting its own coins in silver and gold.<ref>Collins, Robert O., and James M.

At the end of the 6th century, the [[Sasanian Empire]] pushed Aksum out of the peninsula. With the spread of [[Islam]] through [[Western Asia]] and Northern Africa, Aksum's trading networks in the Mediterranean faltered. The Red Sea trade diminished as it was diverted to the [[Persian Gulf]] and dominated by [[Arabs]], causing Aksum to decline.

The [[Bemba people]] and [[Basimba people]]  of northern Zambia were descended from Luba migrants who arrived in Zambia during the 17th century.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 138\u2013139.</ref><ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 159\u2013160.</ref>\n\n===Lunda Empire===\n\n[[File:Lunda houses-1854.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Lunda town and dwelling]]\n{{Main|Kingdom of Lunda#Origin}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of the Lunda Empire}}\n\nIn the 1450s, a [[Luba Empire|Luba]] from the royal family [[Ilunga Tshibinda]] married [[Lunda people|Lunda]] queen Rweej and united all Lunda peoples. Their son ''mulopwe'' Luseeng expanded the kingdom. His son Naweej expanded the empire further and is known as the first Lunda emperor, with the title ''mwato yamvo'' (''mwaant yaav'', ''mwant yav''), the Lord of Vipers. The Luba political system was retained, and conquered peoples were integrated into the system. The ''mwato yamvo'' assigned a ''cilool'' or ''kilolo'' (royal adviser) and tax collector to each state conquered.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 141.</ref><ref name=\"Davidson\">Davidson (1991), p. 161.</ref>\n\nNumerous states claimed descent from the Lunda. The [[Imbangala]] of inland [[Angola]] claimed descent from a founder, Kinguri, brother of Queen Rweej, who could not tolerate the rule of ''mulopwe'' Tshibunda. ''Kinguri'' became the title of kings of states founded by Queen Rweej's brother. The [[Luena people|Luena]] (Lwena) and [[Lozi people|Lozi]] (Luyani) in [[Zambia]] also claim descent from Kinguri. During the 17th century, a Lunda chief and warrior called [[Mwata Kazembe]] set up an [[Eastern Lunda]] kingdom in the valley of the [[Luapula River]]. The Lunda's western expansion also saw claims of descent by the [[Yaka people|Yaka]] and the [[Pende people|Pende]]. The Lunda linked Central Africa with the western coast trade. The kingdom of Lunda came to an end in the 19th century when it was invaded by the [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]], who were armed with guns.<ref name=\"Davidson\" /><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 139, 141.</ref>\n\n===Kingdom of Kongo===\n\n{{Main|Kingdom of Kongo#History}}\nBy the 15th century AD, the farming [[Kongo people|Bakongo people]] (''ba'' being the plural prefix) were unified as the [[Kingdom of Kongo]] under a ruler called the ''[[manikongo]]'', residing in the fertile [[Pool Malebo]] area on the lower [[Congo River]]. The capital was [[M'banza-Kongo]]. With superior organization, they were able to conquer their neighbors and extract tribute. They were experts in metalwork, pottery, and weaving raffia cloth. They stimulated interregional trade via a tribute system controlled by the ''manikongo''. Later, [[maize]] (corn) and [[cassava]] (manioc) would be introduced to the region via trade with the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] at their ports at [[Luanda]] and [[Benguela]]. The maize and cassava would result in population growth in the region and other parts of Africa, replacing [[millet]] as a main staple.<ref>Jevan Cherniwchana and Juan Moreno-Cruz, \"Maize and Precolonial Africa\", ''Journal of Development Economics'' 136 (January 2019), 137-150. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jdeveco.2018.10.008</ref>\n[[File:KingdomKongo1711.png|thumb|right|240px|Kongo in 1711]]\n\nBy the 16th century, the ''manikongo'' held authority from the Atlantic in the west to the [[Kwango River]] in the east. Each territory was assigned a ''mani-mpembe'' (provincial governor) by the ''manikongo''. In 1506, [[Afonso I of Kongo|Afonso I]] (1506\u20131542), a Christian, took over the throne. Slave trading increased with Afonso's wars of conquest. About 1568 to 1569, the [[Jaga (people)|Jaga]] invaded Kongo, laying waste to the kingdom and forcing the ''manikongo'' into exile. In 1574, Manikongo [[\u00c1lvaro I of Kongo|\u00c1lvaro I]] was reinstated with the help of Portuguese mercenaries. During the latter part of the 1660s, the Portuguese tried to gain control of Kongo. Manikongo [[Ant\u00f3nio I of Kongo|Ant\u00f3nio I]] (1661\u20131665), with a Kongolese army of 5,000, was destroyed by an army of Afro-Portuguese at the [[Battle of Mbwila]]. The empire dissolved into petty polities, fighting among each other for war captives to sell into slavery.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 185\u2013188</ref><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 196\u2013198</ref><ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nKongo gained captives from the [[Kingdom of Ndongo]] in wars of conquest. Ndongo was ruled by the ''ngola''. Ndongo would also engage in slave trading with the Portuguese, with [[S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9]] being a transit point to Brazil. The kingdom was not as welcoming as Kongo; it viewed the Portuguese with great suspicion and as an enemy. The Portuguese in the latter part of the 16th century tried to gain control of Ndongo but were defeated by the [[Northern Mbundu people|Mbundu]]. Ndongo experienced depopulation from slave raiding. The leaders established another state at [[Kingdom of Matamba|Matamba]], affiliated with [[Nzinga of Ndongo and Matamba|Queen Nzinga]], who put up a strong resistance to the Portuguese until coming to terms with them. The Portuguese settled along the coast as trade dealers, not venturing on conquest of the interior. Slavery wreaked havoc in the interior, with states initiating wars of conquest for captives. The [[Imbangala]] formed the slave-raiding state of [[Kasanje Kingdom|Kasanje]], a major source of slaves during the 17th and 18th centuries.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 198\u2013199.</ref><ref>Davidson (1991), p. 158.</ref>\n\n===Horn of Africa===\n{{main|Horn of Africa#History}}\n\n====Somalia====\n{{main|History of Somalia}}\n[[File:Gondereshe2008.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Citadel]] of [[Gondershe|Gondershe, Somalia]] was an important city in the medieval [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Ajuran Sultanate|Ajuran Empire]]]]\n\nThe [[History of Islam|birth of Islam]] opposite Somalia's Red Sea coast meant that Somali merchants and sailors living on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] gradually came under the influence of the new religion through their converted [[Arab]] Muslim trading partners.

Conflict arose as to who should be the successor of the prophet. The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyads]] had initially taken control of the [[Caliphate]], with their capital at [[Damascus]]. Later, the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasids]] had taken control, moving the capital to [[Baghdad]]. The [[Berber people]], being independent in spirit and hostile to outside interference in their affairs and to [[Arab]] exclusivity in orthodox Islam, adopted [[Shia Islam|Shi'ite]] and [[Kharijites|Kharijite]] Islam, both considered unorthodox and hostile to the authority of the Abbasid Caliphate. Numerous Kharijite kingdoms came and fell during the 8th and 9th centuries, asserting their independence from Baghdad. In the early 10th century, Shi'ite groups from Syria, claiming descent from Muhammad's daughter [[Fatimah]], founded the [[Fatimid Dynasty]] in the [[Maghreb]]. By 950, they had conquered all of the Maghreb and by 969 all of Egypt. They had immediately broken away from Baghdad.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 75\u201376.</ref>\n\nIn an attempt to bring about a purer form of Islam among the [[Zenaga people|Sanhaja]] Berbers, [[Abdallah ibn Yasin]] founded the [[Almoravid dynasty|Almoravid]] movement in present-day [[Mauritania]] and [[Western Sahara]]. The Sanhaja Berbers, like the [[Soninke people|Soninke]], practiced an indigenous religion alongside Islam. Abdallah ibn Yasin found ready converts in the [[Lamtuna]] Sanhaja, who were dominated by the Soninke in the south and the [[Zenata]] Berbers in the north. By the 1040s, all of the Lamtuna was converted to the Almoravid movement. With the help of Yahya ibn Umar and his brother [[Abu-Bakr Ibn-Umar|Abu Bakr ibn Umar]], the sons of the Lamtuna chief, the Almoravids created an empire extending from the Sahel to the Mediterranean. After the death of Abdallah ibn Yassin and Yahya ibn Umar, Abu Bakr split the empire in half, between himself and [[Yusuf ibn Tashfin]], because it was too big to be ruled by one individual. Abu Bakr took the south to continue fighting the Soninke, and Yusuf ibn Tashfin took the north, expanding it to southern Spain. The death of Abu Bakr in 1087 saw a breakdown of unity and increase military dissension in the south. This caused a re-expansion of the Soninke. The Almoravids were once held responsible for bringing down the [[Ghana Empire]] in 1076, but this view is no longer credited.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005). p 90.</ref>\n\n[[File:Safi minaret.png|thumb|left|250px|The Almohad minaret in Safi]]\n\nDuring the 10th through 13th centuries, there was a large-scale movement of [[bedouin]]s out of the [[Arabian Peninsula]]. About 1050, a quarter of a million Arab nomads from Egypt moved into the Maghreb. Those following the northern coast were referred to as [[Banu Hilal]]. Those going south of the [[Atlas Mountains]] were the [[Banu Sulaym]]. This movement spread the use of the [[Arabic language]] and hastened the decline of the [[Berber languages|Berber language]] and the [[Arabization|Arabisation]] of North Africa. Later an Arabised Berber group, the Hawwara, went south to Nubia via Egypt.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 156\u2013157</ref>\n\nIn the 1140s, [[Abd al-Mu'min]] declared [[jihad]] on the [[Almoravids]], charging them with decadence and corruption. He united the northern Berbers against the Almoravids, overthrowing them and forming the [[Almohad dynasty|Almohad]] Empire. During this period, the Maghreb became thoroughly [[Islamization|Islamised]] and saw the spread of [[literacy]], the development of [[algebra]], and the use of the number [[0 (number)|zero]] and [[decimal]]s. By the 13th century, the Almohad states had split into three rival states. Muslim states were largely extinguished in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] by the Christian kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Castile|Castile]], [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]], and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]]. Around 1415, Portugal engaged in a ''[[reconquista]]'' of North Africa by capturing [[Ceuta]], and in later centuries Spain and Portugal acquired other ports on the North African coast. In 1492, at the end of the [[Granada War]], Spain defeated Muslims in the [[Emirate of Granada]], effectively ending eight centuries of Muslim domination in southern Iberia.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 88\u201392.</ref>\n\nPortugal and Spain took the ports of [[Tangiers]], [[Algiers]], [[Tripoli]], and [[Tunis]]. This put them in direct competition with the [[Ottoman Empire]], which re-took the ports using Turkish corsairs ([[Piracy|pirates]] and [[privateer]]s). The Turkish corsairs would use the ports for raiding Christian ships, a major source of booty for the towns. Technically, North Africa was under the control of the Ottoman Empire, but only the coastal towns were fully under [[Istanbul]]'s control. Tripoli benefited from trade with [[Borno State|Borno]]. The [[pashas]] of Tripoli traded horses, firearms, and armor via Fez with the sultans of the [[Bornu Empire]] for slaves.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 166\u2013167</ref>\n\nIn the 16th century, an Arab nomad tribe that claimed descent from Muhammad's daughter, the [[Saadi dynasty|Saadis]], conquered and united [[Morocco]]. They prevented the Ottoman Empire from reaching to the Atlantic and expelled Portugal from Morocco's western coast. [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] brought the state to the height of its power. He invaded [[Songhai Empire|Songhay]] in 1591, to control the gold trade, which had been diverted to the western coast of Africa for European ships and to the east, to Tunis. Morocco's hold on Songhay diminished in the 17th century. In 1603, after Ahmad's death, the kingdom split into the two sultanates of [[Fes]] and [[Marrakesh]]. Later it was reunited by [[Al-Rashid of Morocco|Moulay al-Rashid]], founder of the [[Alaouite Dynasty]] (1672\u20131727). His brother and successor, [[Ismail ibn Sharif]] (1672\u20131727), strengthened the unity of the country by importing slaves from the Sudan to build up the military.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 167\u2013168.</ref>\n\n====Nile Valley====\n{{See|Nile#History}}\n\n=====Egypt=====\n{{Main|History of Egypt#Arab and Ottoman Egypt (641\u20131882)}}\n{{Further|Lists of rulers of Egypt}}\n[[File:Fatimid Caliphate.PNG|thumb|right|250px|Fatimid Caliphate]]\n\nIn 642 AD, the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] conquered [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Byzantine Egypt]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005 pp. 65-67\"/>\n\nEgypt under the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] was prosperous. Dams and canals were repaired, and wheat, barley, flax, and cotton production increased. Egypt became a major producer of linen and cotton cloth. Its Mediterranean and Red Sea trade increased. Egypt also minted a gold currency called the Fatimid dinar, which was used for international trade. The bulk of revenues came from taxing the [[fellah]]in ([[peasant]] farmers), and taxes were high. Tax collecting was leased to [[Berber people|Berber]] overlords, who were soldiers who had taken part in the Fatimid conquest in 969 AD. The overlords paid a share to the caliphs and retained what was left. Eventually, they became landlords and constituted a settled land aristocracy.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), p. 157.</ref>\n\nTo fill the military ranks, [[Mamluk]] Turkish slave cavalry and Sudanese slave infantry were used. Berber freemen were also recruited. In the 1150s, tax revenues from farms diminished. The soldiers revolted and wreaked havoc in the countryside, slowed trade, and diminished the power and authority of the Fatimid caliphs.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 158.</ref>\n\nDuring the 1160s, Fatimid Egypt came under threat from [[Crusades|European crusaders]]. Out of this threat, a [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] general named [[Saladin|\u1e62al\u0101\u1e25 ad-D\u012bn Y\u016bsuf ibn Ayy\u016bb]] (Saladin), with a small band of professional soldiers, emerged as an outstanding Muslim defender. Saladin defeated the Christian crusaders at Egypt's borders and [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|recaptured Jerusalem]] in 1187. On the death of [[Al-Adid]], the last Fatimid caliph, in 1171, Saladin became the ruler of Egypt, ushering in the [[Ayyubid Dynasty]]. Under his rule, Egypt returned to [[Sunni Islam]], [[Cairo]] became an important center of Arab Islamic learning, and Mamluk slaves were increasingly recruited from Turkey and southern Russia for military service. Support for the military was tied to the ''iqta'', a form of land taxation in which soldiers were given ownership in return for military service.<ref>Shillington, Kevin (2005), pp. 158\u2013159</ref>\n\nOver time, Mamluk slave soldiers became a very powerful [[landed nobility|landed aristocracy]], to the point of getting rid of the Ayyubid dynasty in 1250 and establishing a [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk dynasty]]. The more powerful Mamluks were referred to as ''[[Emir|amirs]]''. For 250 years, Mamluks controlled all of Egypt under a military dictatorship. Egypt extended her territories to Syria and Palestine, thwarted the crusaders, and halted a [[Mongol Empire|Mongol]] invasion in 1260 at the [[Battle of Ain Jalut]]. Mamluk Egypt came to be viewed as a protector of Islam, and of [[Medina]] and [[Mecca]]. Eventually the ''iqta'' system declined and proved unreliable for providing an adequate military. The Mamluks started viewing their ''iqta'' as hereditary and became attuned to urban living. Farm production declined, and dams and canals lapsed into disrepair. Mamluk military skill and technology did not keep pace with new technology of [[handgun]]s and [[cannon]]s.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 159\u2013161.</ref>\n\nWith the rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Egypt was easily defeated. In 1517, at the end of an [[Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War (1516\u201317)|Ottoman\u2013Mamluk War]], Egypt became part of the Ottoman Empire. The [[Istanbul]] government revived the ''iqta'' system. Trade was reestablished in the Red Sea, but it could not completely connect with the [[Indian Ocean]] trade because of growing Portuguese presence. During the 17th and 18th centuries, hereditary Mamluks regained power. The leading Mamluks were referred to as ''[[bey]]s''. [[Pasha]]s, or viceroys, represented the Istanbul government in name only, operating independently. During the 18th century, dynasties of pashas became established. The government was weak and corrupt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 161.</ref>\n\nIn 1798, [[Napoleon]] [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invaded Egypt]]. The local forces had little ability to resist the French conquest. However, the [[British Empire]] and the Ottoman Empire were able to remove French occupation in 1801. These events marked the beginning of a 19th-century Anglo-Franco rivalry over Egypt.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 162.</ref>\n\n=====Sudan=====\n{{Main|History of Sudan}}\n\n====Christian and Islamic Nubia====\n{{Main|Nubia#Christian Nubia|Nubia#Islamic Nubia}}\n{{Further|List of rulers of Makuria}}\n[[File:Christian Nubia.png|thumb|right|250px|Christian Nubia and the Nile [[cataract]]s]]\nAfter [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana of Aksum]] sacked [[Meroe]], people associated with the site of [[Ballana]] moved into [[Nubia]] from the southwest and founded three kingdoms: [[Kingdom of Makuria|Makuria]], [[Nobatia]], and [[Alodia]]. They would rule for 200 years. Makuria was above the [[Cataracts of the Nile|third cataract]], along the Dongola Reach with its capital at [[Dongola]]. Nobadia was to the north with its capital at [[Faras]], and [[Alodia]] was to the south with its capital at [[Soba (city)|Soba]]. Makuria eventually absorbed Nobadia. The people of the region converted to [[Monophysitism|Monophysite Christianity]] around 500 to 600 CE. The church initially started writing in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], then in [[Greek language|Greek]], and finally in [[Old Nubian language|Old Nubian]], a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan]] language. The church was aligned with the [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Egyptian Coptic Church]].<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 67</ref><ref>Ehret (2002), p. 305.</ref>\n\nBy 641, [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|Egypt was conquered]] by the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]. This effectively blocked Christian Nubia and Aksum from Mediterranean Christendom. In 651\u2013652, Arabs from Egypt invaded Christian Nubia. Nubian archers soundly defeated the invaders. The [[Bakt|Baqt (or Bakt) Treaty]] was drawn, recognizing Christian Nubia and regulating trade. The treaty controlled relations between Christian Nubia and Islamic Egypt for almost six hundred years.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 77.</ref>\n\nBy the 13th century, Christian Nubia began its decline. The authority of the monarchy was diminished by the church and nobility. Arab [[bedouin]] tribes began to infiltrate Nubia, causing further havoc. ''[[Fakir]]s'' (holy men) practicing [[Sufism]] introduced Islam into Nubia. By 1366, Nubia had become divided into petty fiefdoms when it was invaded by [[Mamluk]]s. During the 15th century, Nubia was open to Arab immigration. Arab nomads intermingled with the population and introduced the [[Arab culture]] and the [[Arabic]] language. By the 16th century, [[Makuria]] and [[Nobadia]] had been [[Islamization|Islamized]]. During the 16th century, Abdallah Jamma headed an Arab confederation that destroyed Soba, capital of Alodia, the last holdout of Christian Nubia. Later Alodia would fall under the [[Sennar (sultanate)|Funj Sultanate]].<ref>Collins and Burns 2007, p. 77.</ref>\n\nDuring the 15th century, [[Funj people|Funj]] herders migrated north to [[Alodia]] and occupied it. Between 1504 and 1505, the kingdom expanded, reaching its peak and establishing its capital at [[Sennar]] under [[Badi II|Badi II Abu Daqn]] (c. 1644\u20131680). By the end of the 16th century, the Funj had converted to Islam. They pushed their empire westward to [[Kurdufan|Kordofan]]. They expanded eastward, but were halted by Ethiopia. They controlled Nubia down to the 3rd Cataract. The economy depended on captured enemies to fill the army and on merchants travelling through Sennar. Under [[Badi IV]] (1724\u20131762), the army turned on the king, making him nothing but a figurehead. In 1821, the Funj were conquered by [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali]] (1805\u20131849), Pasha of Egypt.<ref>Page, Willie F.(2001).

They slowly moved south, and the earliest ironworks in modern-day [[KwaZulu-Natal|KwaZulu-Natal Province]] are believed to date from around 1050{{Ambiguous|date=March 2020}}.

The state arose in the 12th century CE. Its wealth came from controlling the trade in ivory from the [[Limpopo River|Limpopo Valley]], copper from the mountains of northern [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]], and gold from the [[Zimbabwe]] Plateau between the Limpopo and [[Zambezi River|Zambezi]] rivers, with the [[Swahili people|Swahili]] merchants at [[Chibuene]]. By the mid-13th century, Mapungubwe was abandoned.<ref>Ehret, Christopher (2002). p. 252.</ref>\n\nAfter the decline of Mapungubwe, [[Great Zimbabwe]] rose on the Zimbabwe Plateau. ''Zimbabwe'' means stone building. Great Zimbabwe was the first city in Southern Africa and was the center of an empire, consolidating lesser [[Shona people|Shona]] polities. Stone building was inherited from Mapungubwe. These building techniques were enhanced and came into maturity at Great Zimbabwe, represented by the wall of the Great Enclosure. The dry-stack stone masonry technology was also used to build smaller compounds in the area. Great Zimbabwe flourished by trading with Swahili Kilwa and [[Sofala]]. The rise of Great Zimbabwe parallels the rise of Kilwa. Great Zimbabwe was a major source of gold. Its royal court lived in luxury, wore Indian cotton, surrounded themselves with copper and gold ornaments, and ate on plates from as far away as Persia and China. Around the 1420s and 1430s, Great Zimbabwe was on decline. The city was abandoned by 1450. Some have attributed the decline to the rise of the trading town [[Ingombe Ilede]].<ref>Ehret (2002), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref><ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\">Shillington (2005), pp. 147\u2013153.</ref>\n\nA new chapter of Shona history ensued. Nyatsimba Mutota, a northern Shona king of the Karanga, engaged in conquest. He and his son Mutope conquered the Zimbabwe Plateau, going through [[Mozambique]] to the east coast, linking the empire to the coastal trade. They called their empire ''Wilayatu 'l Mu'anamutapah'' or ''mwanamutapa'' (Lord of the Plundered Lands), or the [[Kingdom of Mutapa]]. ''Monomotapa'' was the Portuguese corruption. They did not build stone structures; the northern Shonas had no traditions of building in stone. After the death of Matope in 1480, the empire split into two small empires: [[Torwa dynasty|Torwa]] in the south and Mutapa in the north. The split occurred over rivalry from two Shona lords, Changa and Togwa, with the ''mwanamutapa'' line. Changa was able to acquire the south, forming the [[Kingdom of Butua]] with its capital at [[Khami]].<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 147-153\"/><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\">Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013254.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Mutapa|Mutapa Empire]] continued in the north under the ''mwenemutapa'' line. During the 16th century the Portuguese were able to establish permanent markets up the Zambezi River in an attempt to gain political and military control of Mutapa. They were partially successful. In 1628, a decisive battle allowed them to put a puppet ''mwanamutapa'' named Mavura, who signed treaties that gave favorable mineral export rights to the Portuguese. The Portuguese were successful in destroying the ''mwanamutapa'' system of government and undermining trade. By 1667, Mutapa was in decay. Chiefs would not allow digging for gold because of fear of Portuguese theft, and the population declined.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 252\u2013154.</ref>\n\nThe [[Kingdom of Butua]] was ruled by a ''changamire'', a title derived from the founder, Changa. Later it became the [[Rozwi Empire]]. The Portuguese tried to gain a foothold but were thrown out of the region in 1693, by Changamire Dombo. The 17th century was a period of peace and prosperity. The Rozwi Empire fell into ruins in the 1830s from invading [[Nguni people|Nguni]] from [[KwaZulu-Natal|Natal]].<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 252-254\"/>\n\n====Namibia====\n{{Main|History of Namibia}}\n[[File:Realnam.JPG|thumb|250px|Herero and Nama territories]]\nBy 1500 AD, most of southern Africa had established states. In northwestern [[Namibia]], the [[Ovambo people|Ovambo]] engaged in farming and the [[Herero people|Herero]] engaged in herding. As cattle numbers increased, the Herero moved southward to central Namibia for grazing land. A related group, the [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]], expanded to [[Ghanzi]] in northwestern [[Botswana]]. The [[Nama people|Nama]], a [[Khoisan languages|Khoi-speaking]], sheep-raising group, moved northward and came into contact with the Herero; this would set the stage for much conflict between the two groups. The expanding [[Lozi people|Lozi]] states pushed the [[Mbukushu]], [[Kuhane language|Subiya]], and Yei to Botei, [[Kavango Region|Okavango]], and [[Chobe District|Chobe]] in northern Botswana.<ref>Shillington (2005), p. 218.</ref>\n\n====South Africa and Botswana====\n{{Main|Early history of South Africa|History of South Africa|History of Botswana}}\n\n=====Sotho\u2013Tswana=====\nThe development of [[Sotho\u2013Tswana peoples|Sotho\u2013Tswana]] states based on the [[highveld]], south of the [[Limpopo River]], began around 1000 CE. The chief's power rested on cattle and his connection to the ancestor. This can be seen in the [[Toutswemogala Hill]] settlements with stone foundations and stone walls, north of the highveld and south of the [[Vaal River]]. Northwest of the Vaal River developed early [[Tswana people|Tswana]] states centered on towns of thousands of people. When disagreements or rivalry arose, different groups moved to form their own states.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\">Shillington (2005), pp. 153\u2013155.</ref>\n\n=====Nguni peoples=====\n[[File:Realzulu.JPG|thumb|250px|South African ethnic groups]]\nSoutheast of the [[Drakensberg]] mountains lived [[Nguni languages|Nguni-speaking]] peoples ([[Zulu people|Zulu]], [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]], [[Swazi people|Swazi]], and [[South Ndebele people|Ndebele]]). They too engaged in state building, with new states developing from rivalry, disagreements, and population pressure causing movement into new regions. This 19th-century process of warfare, state building and migration later became known as the Mfecane (Nguni) or Difaqane (Sotho). Its major catalyst was the consolidation of the [[Zulu Kingdom]].<ref>Worden, Nigel. The Making of Modern South Africa, Oxford UK/Cambridge USA: Blackwell Publishers, 1995, p. 13.</ref> They were metalworkers, cultivators of millet, and cattle herders.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\n=====Khoisan and Boers=====\n[[File:SouthAfrica1885.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Political map of Southern Africa in 1885]]\nThe [[Khoisan]] lived in the southwestern [[Cape Province]], where winter rainfall is plentiful. Earlier Khoisan populations were absorbed by [[Bantu peoples]], such as the [[Sotho people|Sotho]] and [[Nguni people|Nguni]], but the [[Bantu expansion]] stopped at the region with winter rainfall. Some [[Bantu languages]] have incorporated the [[click consonant]] of the [[Khoisan languages]]. The Khoisan traded with their Bantu neighbors, providing cattle, sheep, and hunted items. In return, their Bantu speaking neighbors traded copper, iron, and tobacco.<ref name=\"Shillington 2005, pp. 153-155\"/>\n\nBy the 16th century, the [[Dutch East India Company]] established a replenishing station at [[Table Bay]] for restocking water and purchasing meat from the [[Khoikhoi]]. The Khoikhoi received copper, iron, tobacco, and beads in exchange. In order to control the price of meat and stock and make service more consistent, the Dutch established a permanent settlement at Table Bay in 1652. They grew fresh fruit and vegetables and established a hospital for sick sailors. To increase produce, the Dutch decided to increase the number of farms at Table Bay by encouraging freeburgher ''[[boer]]s'' (farmers) on lands worked initially by slaves from West Africa. The land was taken from Khoikhoi grazing land, triggering the first [[Khoikhoi-Dutch Wars|Khoikhoi-Dutch war]] in 1659. No victors emerged, but the Dutch assumed a \"[[right of conquest]]\" by which they claimed all of the cape. In a series of wars pitting the Khoikhoi against each other, the Boers assumed all Khoikhoi land and claimed all their cattle. The second Khoikoi-Dutch war (1673\u20131677) was a cattle raid. The Khoikhoi also died in thousands from European diseases.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 210\u2013213.</ref>\n\nBy the 18th century, the cape colony had grown, with slaves coming from [[Madagascar]], [[Mozambique]], and [[Indonesia]]. The settlement also started to expand northward, but Khoikhoi resistance, raids, and [[guerrilla warfare]] slowed the expansion during the 18th century. Boers who started to practice pastoralism were known as ''[[trekboer]]s''. A common source of ''trekboer'' labor was orphan children who were captured during raids and whose parents had been killed.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 213\u2013214.</ref>\n\n===Southeast Africa===\n{{Main|Southeast Africa#History}}\n\n====Prehistory====\nAccording to the theory of [[recent African origin of modern humans]], the mainstream position held within the scientific community, all humans originate from either [[Southeast Africa]] or the [[Horn of Africa]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Liu|first1=Hua|last2=Prugnolle|first2=Franck|last3=Manica|first3=Andrea|authorlink4=Francois Balloux|last4=Balloux|first4=Fran\u00e7ois|title=A Geographically Explicit Genetic Model of Worldwide Human-Settlement History|journal=The American Journal of Human Genetics|date=August 2006|volume=79|issue=2|pages=230\u2013237|doi=10.1086/505436|pmid=16826514|pmc=1559480}}</ref> During the first millennium CE, [[Nilotic]] and [[Bantu languages|Bantu]]-speaking peoples [[Bantu expansion|moved into the region]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n====Swahili coast====\n{{Main|Swahili coast#History}}\n[[File:Swahili door Zanzibar.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A traditional Zanzibari-style [[Swahili people|Swahili]] coast door in [[Zanzibar]].]]\nFollowing the Bantu Migration, on the coastal section of Southeast Africa, a mixed Bantu community developed through contact with [[Muslim]] [[Arab]] and [[Persian people|Persian]] traders, leading to the development of the mixed Arab, Persian and African [[Swahili Coast|Swahili City States]].<ref>{{cite book|author=James De Vere Allen|title=Swahili origins: Swahili culture & the Shungwaya phenomenon|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_D5yAAAAMAAJ|year=1993|publisher=J.

The culture's earliest dated artifacts are located in the [[Kagera Region]] of [[Tanzania]], and it extended as far west as the [[Kivu]] region of the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], as far east as the [[Nyanza Province|Nyanza]] and [[Western Province (Kenya)|Western]] provinces of [[Kenya]], and north into [[Uganda]], [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]]. Sites from the Urewe culture date from the Early Iron Age, from the 5th century BC to the 6th century AD.\n\nThe origins of the Urewe culture are ultimately in the [[Bantu expansion]] originating in Cameroon. Research into early Iron Age civilizations in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] has been undertaken concurrently with studies on African linguistics on Bantu expansion. The Urewe culture may correspond to the Eastern subfamily of Bantu languages, spoken by the descendants of the first wave of Bantu peoples to settle East Africa. At first sight, Urewe seems to be a fully developed civilization recognizable through its distinctive, stylish earthenware and highly technical and sophisticated iron working techniques. Given our current level of knowledge, neither seems to have developed or altered for nearly 2,000 years. However, minor local variations in the ceramic ware can be observed.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nUrewe is the name of the site in Kenya brought to prominence through the publication in 1948 of [[Mary Leakey]]'s archaeological findings.

The [[Ntusi]] and [[Bigo]] earthworks are representative of one of the first states, the [[Bunyoro kingdom]], which oral tradition stipulates was part of the [[Empire of Kitara]] that dominated the whole Lakes region.

Over time, the ''kabakas'' diluted the authority of the ''bataka'', with Buganda becoming a centralized monarchy. By the 16th century, Buganda was engaged in expansion but had a serious rival in [[Bunyoro]]. By the 1870s, Buganda was a wealthy nation-state. The ''kabaka'' ruled with his ''Lukiko'' (council of ministers). Buganda had a naval fleet of a hundred vessels, each manned by thirty men. Buganda supplanted Bunyoro as the most important state in the region.

[[Tutsi]] (BaTutsi) pastoralists formed the elite, with a king called the ''[[mwami]]''. The [[Hutu]] (BaHutu) were farmers. Both groups spoke the same language, but there were strict social norms against marrying each other and interaction. According to oral tradition, the Kingdom of Rwanda was founded by Mwami Ruganzu II (Ruganzu Ndori) (c. 1600\u20131624), with his capital near [[Kigali]]. It took 200 years to attain a truly centralized kingdom under Mwami [[Kigeli IV of Rwanda|Kigeli IV]] (Kigeri Rwabugiri) (1840\u20131895). Subjugation of the Hutu proved more difficult than subduing the Tutsi. The last Tutsi chief gave up to Mwami [[Mutara II of Rwanda|Mutara II]] (Mutara Rwogera) (1802\u20131853) in 1852, but the last Hutu holdout was conquered in the 1920s by Mwami [[Yuhi V of Rwanda|Yuhi V]] (Yuli Musinga) (1896\u20131931).<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 123\u2013124.</ref>\n\n=====Burundi=====\n{{Main|Kingdom of Burundi#History}}\n{{Further|List of Kings of Burundi}}\nSouth of the Kingdom of Rwanda was the [[Burundian monarchy|Kingdom of Burundi]].

Like Rwanda, Burundi was built on cattle raised by Tutsi pastoralists, crops from Hutu farmers, conquest, and political innovations. Under Mwami [[Ntare IV Rutaganzwa Rugamba|Ntare Rugaamba]] (c. 1795\u20131852), Burundi pursued an aggressive expansionist policy, one based more on diplomacy than force.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 124.</ref>\n\n====Maravi====\n{{Main|Maravi}}\n[[File:Maravi Kingdom map c. 1650s.svg|thumb|right|120px|Maravi Kingdom]]\nThe [[Maravi]] claimed descent from Karonga (''kalonga''), who took that title as king. The Maravi connected Central Africa to the east coastal trade, with [[Swahili people|Swahili]] Kilwa. By the 17th century, the Maravi Empire encompassed all the area between [[Lake Malawi]] and the mouth of the [[Zambezi River]]. The ''karonga'' was Mzura, who did much to extend the empire. Mzura made a pact with the Portuguese to establish a 4,000-man army to attack the [[Shona people|Shona]] in return for aid in defeating his rival Lundi, a chief of the Zimba. In 1623, he turned on the Portuguese and assisted the Shona. In 1640, he welcomed back the Portuguese for trade. The Maravi Empire did not long survive the death of Mzura. By the 18th century, it had broken into its previous polities.<ref>Davidson (1991), pp. 164\u2013165.</ref>\n\n===West Africa===\n{{Main|History of West Africa}}\n\n====Sahelian empires & states====\n{{Main|Sahelian kingdoms#History of Sahel kingdoms}}\n\n=====Ghana=====\n{{Main|Ghana Empire#Origin}}\n{{see also|Serer history}}\n[[File:Ghana empire map.png|thumb|right|250px|Ghana at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Ghana Empire]] may have been an established kingdom as early as the 8th century AD, founded among the [[Soninke people|Soninke]] by Dinge Cisse. Ghana was first mentioned by Arab geographer [[Al-Farazi]] in the late 8th century. Ghana was inhabited by urban dwellers and rural farmers. The urban dwellers were the administrators of the empire, who were Muslims, and the ''Ghana'' (king), who practiced traditional religion. Two towns existed, one where the Muslim administrators and Berber-Arabs lived, which was connected by a stone-paved road to the king's residence. The rural dwellers lived in villages, which joined together into broader polities that pledged loyalty to the ''Ghana.'' The ''Ghana'' was viewed as divine, and his physical well-being reflected on the whole society. Ghana converted to [[Islam]] around 1050, after conquering [[Aoudaghost]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 80\u201385.</ref>\n\nThe Ghana Empire grew wealthy by taxing the [[trans-Saharan trade]] that linked [[Tiaret]] and [[Sijilmasa]] to Aoudaghost. Ghana controlled access to the goldfields of [[Bambouk]], southeast of [[Koumbi Saleh]]. A percentage of salt and gold going through its territory was taken. The empire was not involved in production.<ref>Iliffe, John(2007). pp. 51\u201353.</ref>\n\nBy the 11th century, Ghana was in decline. It was once thought that the sacking of Koumbi Saleh by Berbers under the [[Almoravid dynasty]] in 1076 was the cause. This is no longer accepted. Several alternative explanations are cited. One important reason is the transfer of the gold trade east to the [[Niger River]] and the [[Taghaza]] Trail, and Ghana's consequent economic decline. Another reason cited is political instability through rivalry among the different hereditary polities.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 83.</ref>\nThe empire came to an end in 1230, when [[Takrur]] in northern [[Senegal]] took over the capital.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\">Davidson (1991), pp. 173\u2013174.</ref><ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/africa/features/storyofafrica/4chapter1.shtml The Story of Africa| BBC World Service<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\n=====Mali=====\n{{Main|Mali Empire#Pre-imperial Mali}}\n{{Further|Keita Dynasty}}\n[[File:MALI empire map.PNG|thumb|250px|Mali Empire at its greatest extent]]\nThe [[Mali Empire]] began in the 13th century AD, when a [[Mand\u00e9 peoples|Mande]] (Mandingo) leader, [[Sundiata Keita|Sundiata]] (Lord Lion) of the Keita clan, defeated [[Soumaoro Kant\u00e9]], king of the [[Susu people|Sosso]] or southern [[Soninke people|Soninke]], at the [[Battle of Kirina]] in c. 1235. Sundiata continued his conquest from the fertile forests and Niger Valley, east to the Niger Bend, north into the Sahara, and west to the Atlantic Ocean, absorbing the remains of the Ghana Empire. Sundiata took on the title of ''[[Mansa (title)|mansa]]''. He established the capital of his empire at [[Niani, Mali|Niani]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n\nAlthough the salt and gold trade continued to be important to the Mali Empire, agriculture and pastoralism was also critical. The growing of [[sorghum]], [[millet]], and rice was a vital function. On the northern borders of the [[Sahel]], grazing cattle, sheep, goats, and camels were major activities. Mande society was organize around the village and land. A cluster of villages was called a ''kafu'', ruled by a ''farma''. The ''farma'' paid tribute to the ''mansa''. A dedicated army of elite cavalry and infantry maintained order, commanded by the royal court. A formidable force could be raised from tributary regions, if necessary.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 83\u201387.</ref>\n\nConversion to [[Islam]] was a gradual process. The power of the ''mansa'' depended on upholding traditional beliefs and a spiritual foundation of power. Sundiata initially kept Islam at bay. Later ''mansas'' were devout Muslims but still acknowledged traditional [[Deity|deities]] and took part in traditional rituals and festivals, which were important to the Mande. Islam became a court religion under Sundiata's son [[Uli I of Mali|Uli I]] (1225\u20131270). ''Mansa'' Uli made a pilgrimage to [[Mecca]], becoming recognized within the Muslim world. The court was staffed with literate Muslims as secretaries and accountants. Muslim traveller [[Ibn Battuta]] left vivid descriptions of the empire.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nMali reached the peak of its power and extent in the 14th century, when [[Musa I of Mali|''Mansa'' Musa]] (1312\u20131337) made his famous ''[[hajj]]'' to Mecca with 500 slaves, each holding a bar of gold worth 500 mitqals.<ref>Davidson, Basil (1971), ''Great Ages of Man: African Kingdoms'', p. 83. New York City: [[Time Life|Time Life Books]]. [[Library of Congress]] 66-25647.</ref> ''Mansa'' Musa's ''hajj'' devalued gold in [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Mamluk Egypt]] for a decade. He made a great impression on the minds of the Muslim and European world. He invited scholars and architects like [[Al Sahili|Ishal al-Tuedjin]] (al-Sahili) to further integrate Mali into the [[Muslim world|Islamic world]].<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\nThe Mali Empire saw an expansion of learning and [[literacy]]. In 1285, [[Sakura (mansa)|Sakura]], a [[Freedman|freed slave]], usurped the throne. This ''mansa'' drove the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] out of [[Timbuktu]] and established it as a center of learning and commerce. The book trade increased, and book copying became a very respectable and profitable profession. Timbuktu and [[Djenn\u00e9]] became important centers of learning within the Islamic world.<ref>Davidson (1971), pp. 84\u201385.</ref>\n\nAfter the reign of [[Suleyman (mansa)|Mansa Suleyman]] (1341\u20131360), Mali began its spiral downward. [[Mossi people|Mossi]] cavalry raided the exposed southern border. Tuareg harassed the northern border in order to retake Timbuktu. [[Fula people|Fulani]] (Fulbe) eroded Mali's authority in the west by establishing the independent [[Imamate of Futa Toro]], a successor to the kingdom of [[Takrur]]. [[Serer people|Serer]] and [[Wolof Empire|Wolof]] alliances were broken. In 1545 to 1546, the [[Songhai Empire]] took [[Niani, Mali Empire|Niani]]. After 1599, the empire lost the [[Bambouk]] goldfields and disintegrated into petty polities.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 83-87\"/>\n\n=====Songhai=====\n{{Main|Songhai Empire#History}}\n{{Further|Askiya Dynasty|Sonni Dynasty}}\n[[File:SONGHAI empire map.PNG|thumb|right|250px|The Songhai Empire, c. 1500]]\nThe [[Songhai people]] are descended from fishermen on the [[Niger River|Middle Niger River]]. They established their capital at Kukiya in the 9th century AD and at [[Gao]] in the 12th century. The Songhai speak a [[Nilo-Saharan languages|Nilo-Saharan language]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 87.</ref>\n\n[[Sonni Ali]], a Songhai, began his conquest by capturing [[Timbuktu]] in 1468 from the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]]. He extended the empire to the north, deep into the desert, pushed the [[Mossi people|Mossi]] further south of the Niger, and expanded southwest to Djenne. His army consisted of cavalry and a fleet of canoes. Sonni Ali was not a Muslim, and he was portrayed negatively by Berber-Arab scholars, especially for attacking Muslim Timbuktu. After his death in 1492, his heirs were deposed by General [[Askia Mohammad I|Muhammad Ture]], a Muslim of Soninke origins<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013101.</ref>\n\nMuhammad Ture (1493\u20131528) founded the [[Askiya Dynasty]], ''[[askiya]]'' being the title of the king. He consolidated the conquests of Sonni Ali. Islam was used to extend his authority by declaring [[jihad]] on the Mossi, reviving the trans-Saharan trade, and having the [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid \"shadow\" caliph]] in Cairo declare him as caliph of Sudan. He established Timbuktu as a great center of Islamic learning. Muhammad Ture expanded the empire by pushing the Tuareg north, capturing A\u00efr in the east, and capturing salt-producing [[Taghaza]]. He brought the [[Hausa Kingdoms|Hausa states]] into the Songhay trading network. He further centralized the administration of the empire by selecting administrators from loyal servants and families and assigning them to conquered territories. They were responsible for raising local militias. Centralization made Songhay very stable, even during dynastic disputes. [[Leo Africanus]] left vivid descriptions of the empire under Askiya Muhammad. Askiya Muhammad was deposed by his son in 1528. After much rivalry, Muhammad Ture's last son [[Askia Daoud|Askiya Daoud]] (1529\u20131582) assumed the throne.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 88.</ref>\n\nIn 1591, [[Morocco]] invaded the Songhai Empire under [[Ahmad al-Mansur]] of the [[Saadi Dynasty]] in order to secure the goldfields of the Sahel. At the [[Battle of Tondibi]], the Songhai army was defeated. The Moroccans captured Djenne, Gao, and Timbuktu, but they were unable to secure the whole region. Askiya Nuhu and the Songhay army regrouped at [[Dendi Kingdom|Dendi]] in the heart of Songhai territory where a spirited guerrilla resistance sapped the resources of the Moroccans, who were dependent upon constant resupply from Morocco. Songhai split into several states during the 17th century.\n\nMorocco found its venture unprofitable. The gold trade had been diverted to Europeans on the coast. Most of the trans-Saharan trade was now diverted east to [[Bornu Empire|Bornu]]. Expensive equipment purchased with gold had to be sent across the Sahara, an unsustainable scenario. The Moroccans who remained married into the population and were referred to as ''[[Arma people|Arma]]'' or ''Ruma''. They established themselves at Timbuktu as a military caste with various fiefs, independent from Morocco. Amid the chaos, other groups began to assert themselves, including the [[Fula people|Fulani]] of [[Futa Tooro]] who encroached from the west. The [[Bambara Empire]], one of the states that broke from Songhai, sacked Gao. In 1737, the Tuareg massacred the ''Arma''.<ref name=\"Burns 2007 pp. 88-89\">Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 88\u201389.</ref><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 100\u2013102, 179\u2013181.</ref>\n\n=====Sokoto Caliphate=====\n{{Main|Sokoto Caliphate#History}}\n[[File:Scramble-for-Africa-1880-1913.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of Africa in the years 1880 and 1913]]\nThe [[Fula people|Fulani]] were migratory people. They moved from [[Mauritania]] and settled in [[Futa Tooro]], [[Fouta Djallon|Futa Djallon]], and subsequently throughout the rest of West Africa. By the 14th century CE, they had converted to [[Islam]]. During the 16th century, they established themselves at [[Macina, Mali|Macina]] in southern [[Mali]]. During the 1670s, they declared [[jihad]]s on non-Muslims. Several states were formed from these jihadist wars, at Futa Toro, Futa Djallon, Macina, [[Oualia]], and Bundu. The most important of these states was the [[Sokoto Caliphate]] or [[Fulani Empire]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.blackpast.org/global-african-history/sultanate-sokoto-sokoto-caliphate/ |title=About the Sokoto Caliphate  |last=Amy Yoo |first=Jiwon |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date=1 August 2019 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the city of [[Gobir]], [[Usman dan Fodio]] (1754\u20131817) accused the Hausa leadership of practicing an impure version of Islam and of being morally corrupt.

Jihad fever swept northern [[Nigeria]], with strong support among both the Fulani and the Hausa. Usman created an empire that included parts of northern Nigeria, [[Benin]], and [[Cameroon]], with [[Sokoto]] as its capital.

During the 13th century, when the gold mines in modern-day [[Mali]] started to dry up, Bonoman and later other Akan states began to rise to prominence as the major players in the Gold trade. It was [[Bonoman]] and other Akan kingdoms like [[Denkyira]], [[Akyem]], [[Akwamu]] which were the predecessors to what became the all-powerful [[Empire of Ashanti]]. When and how the Ashante got to their present location is debatable. What is known is that by the 17th century an Akan people were identified as living in a state called Kwaaman. The location of the state was north of Lake Bosomtwe. The state's revenue was mainly derived from trading in gold and [[kola nut]]s and clearing forest to plant [[yam (vegetable)|yams]]. They built towns between the [[Pra River (Ghana)|Pra]] and [[Ofin]] rivers. They formed alliances for defense and paid tribute to [[Denkyira]] one of the more powerful Akan states at that time along with Adansi and [[Akwamu]]. During the 16th century, Ashante society experienced sudden changes, including population growth because of cultivation of [[New World]] plants such as [[cassava]] and [[maize]] and an increase in the gold trade between the coast and the north.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 139.</ref>\n\nBy the 17th century, [[Osei Kofi Tutu I]] (c. 1695\u20131717), with help of [[Okomfo Anokye]], unified what became the Ashante into a confederation with the [[Asante royal thrones|Golden Stool]] as a symbol of their unity and spirit. Osei Tutu engaged in a massive territorial expansion. He built up the Ashante army based on the [[Akan people|Akan]] state of [[Akwamu]], introducing new organization and turning a disciplined militia into an effective fighting machine. In 1701, the Ashante conquered Denkyira, giving them access to the coastal trade with Europeans, especially the Dutch. [[Opoku Ware I]] (1720\u20131745) engaged in further expansion, adding other southern Akan states to the growing empire. He turned north adding [[Techiman]], Banda, [[Gyaaman]], and [[Gonja people|Gonja]], states on the [[Black Volta]]. Between 1744 and 1745, ''Asantehene'' Opoku attacked the powerful northern state of Dagomba, gaining control of the important middle Niger trade routes. [[Kusi Obodom]] (1750\u20131764) succeeded Opoku. He solidified all the newly won territories. [[Osei Kwadwo]] (1777\u20131803) imposed administrative reforms that allowed the empire to be governed effectively and to continue its military expansion. [[Osei Kwame Panyin]] (1777\u20131803), Osei Tutu Kwame (1804\u20131807), and Osei Bonsu (1807\u20131824) continued territorial consolidation and expansion. The Ashante Empire included all of present-day [[Ghana]] and large parts of the [[Ivory Coast]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140.</ref>\n\nThe ''ashantehene'' inherited his position from his mother. He was assisted at the capital, Kumasi, by a civil service of men talented in trade, diplomacy, and the military, with a head called the ''Gyaasehene''. Men from Arabia, Sudan, and Europe were employed in the civil service, all of them appointed by the ''ashantehene''. At the capital and in other towns, the ''ankobia'' or special police were used as bodyguards to the ''ashantehene'', as sources of intelligence, and to suppress rebellion. Communication throughout the empire was maintained via a network of well-kept roads from the coast to the middle Niger and linking together other trade cities.<ref>Davidson (1991), p. 240.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140\u2013141.</ref>\n\nFor most of the 19th century, the Ashante Empire remained powerful.

They began to assert their power a few years later. In so doing they established the Kingdom of Dahomey, with its capital at [[Agbome]]. King [[Houegbadja]] (c. 1645\u20131685) organized Dahomey into a powerful centralized state. He declared all lands to be owned of the king and subject to taxation. [[Primogeniture]] in the kingship was established, neutralizing all input from village chiefs. A \"cult of kingship\" was established. A captive slave would be sacrificed annually to honor the royal ancestors. During the 1720s, the slave-trading states of [[Kingdom of Whydah|Whydah]] and [[Allada]] were taken, giving Dahomey direct access to the slave coast and trade with Europeans. King [[Agadja]] (1708\u20131740) attempted to end the slave trade by keeping the slaves on plantations producing palm oil, but the European profits on slaves and Dahomey's dependency on [[firearm]]s were too great. In 1730, under king Agaja, Dahomey was conquered by the [[Oyo Empire]], and Dahomey had to pay tribute. Taxes on slaves were mostly paid in cowrie shells. During the 19th century, palm oil was the main trading commodity.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 191\u2013192.</ref> [[French colonial empire|France]] conquered Dahomey during the [[Second Franco-Dahomean War]] (1892\u20131894) and established a colonial government there.

The name comes from a [[Hausa language|Hausa]] word to refer to the [[Oyo Empire]]. The first Yoruba state was [[Ife|Ile-Ife]], said to have been founded around 1000 AD by a supernatural figure, the first ''oni'' [[Oduduwa]]. Oduduwa's sons would be the founders of the different city-states of the Yoruba, and his daughters would become the mothers of the various Yoruba ''obas'', or kings. Yoruba city-states were usually governed by an ''oba'' and an ''iwarefa'', a council of chiefs who advised the ''oba.'' by the 18th century, the Yoruba city-states formed a loose confederation, with the ''Oni'' of Ife as the head and Ife as the capital. As time went on, the individual city-states became more powerful with their ''obas'' assuming more powerful spiritual positions and diluting the authority of the ''Oni'' of Ife. Rivalry became intense among the city-states.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 131\u2013132.</ref>\n\nThe Oyo Empire rose in the 16th century. The Oyo state had been conquered in 1550 by the kingdom of [[Nupe people|Nupe]], which was in possession of cavalry, an important tactical advantage. The ''alafin'' (king) of Oyo was sent into exile. After returning, ''Alafin'' [[Orompoto]] (c. 1560\u20131580) built up an army based on heavily armed cavalry and long-service troops. This made them invincible in combat on the northern grasslands and in the thinly wooded forests. By the end of the 16th century, Oyo had added the western region of the Niger to the hills of Togo, the Yoruba of [[Ketu (Benin)|Ketu]], Dahomey, and the Fon nation.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nA governing council served the empire, with clear executive divisions. Each acquired region was assigned a local administrator. Families served in king-making capacities. Oyo, as a northern Yoruba kingdom, served as middle-man in the north\u2013south trade and connecting the eastern forest of [[Guinea]] with the western and central [[Sahel|Sudan]], the Sahara, and North Africa. The Yoruba manufactured cloth, ironware, and pottery, which were exchanged for salt, leather, and most importantly horses from the Sudan to maintain the cavalry. Oyo remained strong for two hundred years.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 173\u2013174\"/><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 134.</ref> It became a protectorate of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] in 1888, before further fragmenting into warring factions.

It was engaged in political expansion and consolidation from its very beginning. Under ''Oba'' (king) [[Ewuare]] (c. 1450\u20131480 AD), the state was organized for conquest. He solidified central authority and initiated 30 years of war with his neighbors. At his death, the Benin Empire extended to [[Dahomey]] in the west, to the [[Niger Delta]] in the east, along the west African coast, and to the Yoruba towns in the north.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nEwuare's grandson ''Oba'' [[Esigie]] (1504\u20131550) eroded the power of the ''uzama'' (state council) and increased contact and trade with Europeans, especially with the Portuguese who provided a new source of copper for court art.\nThe ''oba'' ruled with the advice of the ''uzama'', a council consisting of chiefs of powerful families and town chiefs of different guilds. Later its authority was diminished by the establishment of administrative dignitaries. Women wielded power.

By the early 18th century, it was wrecked with dynastic disputes and civil wars. However, it regained much of its former power in the reigns of Oba Eresoyen and Oba Akengbuda. After the 16th century, Benin mainly exported pepper, ivory, gum, and cotton cloth to the Portuguese and Dutch who resold it to other African societies on the coast.

These city-states were protected by the waterways and thick vegetation of the delta. The region was transformed by trade in the 17th century. The delta's city-states were comparable to those of the [[Swahili people]] in East Africa. Some, like [[Kingdom of Bonny|Bonny]], [[Kalabari Kingdom|Kalabari]], and [[Kingdom of Warri|Warri]], had kings. Others, like [[Brass, Nigeria|Brass]], were republics with small senates, and those at [[Cross River State|Cross River]] and [[Calabar|Old Calabar]] were ruled by merchants of the ''ekpe'' society. The ''ekpe'' society regulated trade and made rules for members known as house systems. Some of these houses, like the Pepples of Bonny, were well known in the Americas and Europe.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 136\u2013137.</ref>\n\nThe [[Igbo people|Igbo]] lived east of the delta (but with the [[Anioma]] on the west of the Niger River). The [[Kingdom of Nri]] rose in the 9th century, with the ''Eze'' Nri being its leader. It was a political entity composed of villages, and each village was autonomous and independent with its own territory and name, each recognized by its neighbors. Villages were democratic with all males and sometimes females a part of the decision-making process. Graves at [[Igbo-Ukwu]] (800 AD) contained brass artifacts of local manufacture and glass beads from Egypt or India, indicative of extraregional trade.<ref>Martin, Phyllis M. and O'Meara, Patrick(1995). p. 95.</ref><ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 137.</ref>\n\n==19th century==\n\n===Southern Africa===\n{{Main|Southern Africa#History}}\nBy the 1850s, British and German missionaries and traders had penetrated present-day [[Namibia]]. [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] competed for guns and ammunition, providing cattle, ivory, and ostrich feathers. The Germans were more firmly established than the British in the region. By 1884, the [[German colonial empire|Germans]] declared the coastal region from the [[Orange River]] to the [[Cunene River|Kunene River]] a German protectorate, part of [[German South West Africa]]. They pursued an aggressive policy of land expansion for white settlements. They exploited rivalry between the Nama and Herero.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327\u2013329, 340\u2013342.</ref>\n\nThe Herero entered into an alliance with the Germans, thinking they could get an upper hand on the Nama. The Germans set up a garrison at the Herero capital and started allocating Herero land for white settlements, including the best grazing land in the central plateau, and made tax and labor demands. The Herero and [[Mbanderu people|Ovambanderu]] rebelled, but the rebellion was crushed and leaders were executed. Between 1896 and 1897, [[rinderpest]] crippled the economic backbone of the Herero and Nama economy and slowed white expansion. The Germans continued the policy of making Namibia a white settlement by seizing land and cattle, and even trying to export Herero labor to South Africa.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327</ref>\n\nIn 1904, the Herero rebelled. German General [[Lothar von Trotha]] implemented an [[Herero and Namaqua genocide|extermination policy]] at the [[Battle of Waterberg]], which drove the Herero west of the [[Kalahari Desert]]. At the end of 1905, only 16,000 Herero were alive, out of a previous population of 80,000. Nama resistance was crushed in 1907. All Nama and Herero cattle and land were confiscated from the very diminished population, with remaining Nama and Herero assuming a subordinate position. Labor had to be imported from among the Ovambo.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 218, 327.</ref>\n\n===Nguniland===\n{{Main|Nguni people#History}}\n[[File:Dance of Landeens.jpg|thumb|250px|Zulu warriors]]\nA moment of great disorder in southern Africa was the ''[[Mfecane]]'', \"the crushing.\" It was started by the northern Nguni kingdoms of [[Mthethwa Paramountcy|Mthethwa]], [[Ndwandwe]], and [[Swaziland]] over scarce resource and famine. When [[Dingiswayo]] of Mthethwa died, [[Shaka]] of the Zulu people took over. He established the [[Zulu Kingdom]], asserting authority over the Ndwandwe and pushing the Swazi north. The scattering Ndwandwe and Swazi caused the Mfecane to spread. During the 1820s, Shaka expanded the empire all along the Drakensberg foothills, with tribute being paid as far south as the [[Tugela River|Tugela]] and [[Umzimkulu River|Umzimkulu]] rivers. He replaced the chiefs of conquered polities with ''indunas'', responsible to him. He introduced a centralized, dedicated, and disciplined military force not seen in the region, with a new weapon in the short stabbing-spear.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257, 270.</ref>\n\nIn 1828, Shaka was assassinated by his half brother [[Dingane kaSenzangakhona|Dingane]], who lacked the military genius and leadership skills of Shaka. [[Voortrekkers]] tried to occupy Zulu land in 1838. In the early months they were defeated, but the survivors regrouped at the [[Blood River|Ncome River]] and soundly defeated the Zulu. However, the Voortrekkers dared not settle Zulu land. Dingane was killed in 1840 during a civil war. His brother [[Mpande]] took over and strengthened Zulu territories to the north. In 1879 [[Anglo-Zulu War|the Zulu Kingdom was invaded]] by Britain in a quest to control all of [[South Africa]]. The Zulu Kingdom was victorious at the [[Battle of Isandlwana]] but was defeated at the [[Battle of Ulundi]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 256\u2013257.</ref><ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\">Davidson (1991), pp. 274\u2013275.</ref>\n\nOne of the major states to emerge from the [[Mfecane]] was the [[Lesotho|Sotho Kingdom]] founded at [[Thaba Bosiu]] by [[Moshoeshoe I]] around 1821 to 1822. It was a [[confederation]] of different polities that accepted the absolute authority of Moshoeshoe. During the 1830s, the kingdom invited missionaries as a strategic means of acquiring guns and horses from the [[Cape Province|Cape]]. The [[Orange Free State]] slowly diminished the kingdom but never completely defeated it. In 1868, Moshoeshoe asked that the Sotho Kingdom be annexed by Britain, to save the remnant. It became the British protectorate of [[Basutoland]].<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 261\u2013262, 271.</ref>\n\n===Sotho-Tswana===\n{{Main|Sotho people#History|Tswana people#History}}\nThe arrival of the ancestors of the Tswana-speakers who came to control the region (from the [[Vaal River]] to Botswana) has yet to be dated precisely although AD 600 seems to be a consensus estimate. This massive cattle-raising complex prospered until 1300 AD or so. All these various peoples were connected to trade routes that ran via the Limpopo River to the Indian Ocean, and trade goods from Asia such as beads made their way to Botswana most likely in exchange for ivory, gold, and rhinoceros horn.\nThe first written records relating to modern-day Botswana appear in 1824. What these records show is that the Bangwaketse had become the predominant power in the region. Under the rule of Makaba II, the Bangwaketse kept vast herds of cattle in well-protected desert areas, and used their military prowess to raid their neighbours. Other chiefdoms in the area, by this time, had capitals of 10,000 or so and were fairly prosperous. This equilibrium came to end during the Mfecane period, 1823\u20131843, when a succession of invading peoples from South Africa entered the country. Although the Bangwaketse were able to defeat the invading Bakololo in 1826, over time all the major chiefdoms in Botswana were attacked, weakened, and impoverished. The Bakololo and Amandebele raided repeatedly, and took large numbers of cattle, women, and children from the Batswana\u2014most of whom were driven into the desert or sanctuary areas such as hilltops and caves. Only after 1843, when the Amandebele moved into western Zimbabwe, did this threat subside.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iexplore.com/articles/travel-guides/africa/botswana/history-and-culture|title=Botswana \u2013 History and Culture|website=www.iexplore.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Bo-Co/Botswana.html|title=Culture of Botswana \u2013 history, people, clothing, traditions, women, beliefs, food, customs, family|website=www.everyculture.com|access-date=2018-11-08}}</ref>\nDuring the 1840s and 1850s trade with Cape Colony-based merchants opened up and enabled the Batswana chiefdoms to rebuild. The Bakwena, Bangwaketse, Bangwato and Batawana cooperated to control the lucrative ivory trade, and then used the proceeds to import horses and guns, which in turn enabled them to establish control over what is now Botswana. This process was largely complete by 1880, and thus the Bushmen, the Bakalanga, the Bakgalagadi, the [[Tswapong people|Batswapong]] and other current minorities were subjugated by the Batswana. Following the Great Trek, Afrikaners from the Cape Colony established themselves on the borders of Botswana in the Transvaal. In 1852 a coalition of Tswana chiefdoms led by Sechele I resisted Afrikaner incursions, and after about eight years of intermittent tensions and hostilities, eventually came to a peace agreement in Potchefstroom in 1860. From that point on, the modern-day border between South Africa and Botswana was agreed on, and the Afrikaners and Batswana traded and worked together peacefully.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ramsay|first=Jeff|date=1991-01-01|title=The Batswana-Boer War of 1852\u201353: how the Batswana achieved victory|url=https://journals.co.za/content/botnotes/23/1/AJA052550590_916|journal=Botswana Notes & Records|language=en|volume=23|issue=1|issn=0525-5090}}</ref>\nIn the 1820s, refugees from the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] expansion under [[Shaka]]<ref>{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= [[Cambridge University Press]]}}</ref> came into contact with the Basotho people residing on the highveld.\nIn 1823, those pressures caused one group of Basotho, the [[Makololo|Kololo]], to migrate north, past the [[Okavango Swamp]] and across the [[Zambezi]] into Barotseland, now part of [[Zambia]].<ref>{{Cite web|author=Muimui, Lubosi|title=Political History of Barotseland|url=http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140423171845/http://www.barotseland.info/POLITICAL_HISTORY_BAROTSELAND.html|archivedate=23 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> In 1845, the Kololo conquered Barotseland.<ref>{{Cite encyclopedia|author=Phiri, Bizeck J.|year=2005|editor=Shillington, Kevin|title=Lozi Kingdom and the Kololo|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of African History, Volume II, H\u2013O|publisher=Fitzroy Dearborn (Routledge)|location=New York|pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=umyHqvAErOAC&pg=PA851 851\u2013852]|isbn=978-1-57958-454-2}}</ref>\n\nAt about the same time, the [[Boers]] began to encroach upon Basotho territory.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\">{{cite book|last=Ross|first= R. |year=2009|title=A Concise History of South Africa|location= Cambridge|publisher= Cambridge University Press}}.</ref> After the [[Cape Colony]] had been ceded to Britain at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, the ''[[voortrekker]]s'' (\"pioneers\") were farmers who opted to leave the former Dutch colony and moved inland where they eventually established independent polities.<ref name=\"Ross 2009\"/><ref name=\"Thompson 2001\">{{cite book|last=Thompson|first= L. |year=2001|title= A History of South Africa|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofsouthaf00thom_0|url-access=registration|publisher= Yale University Press|location= Cambridge}}.</ref>\n\nAt the time of these developments, [[Moshoeshoe I]] gained control of the Basotho kingdoms of the southern Highveld.<ref name=\"Thompson 2001\"/> Universally praised as a skilled diplomat and strategist, he was able to wield the disparate refugee groups escaping the [[Difaqane]] into a cohesive nation.<ref>Becker, P.

The Khoikhoi had lost economic and political independence and had been absorbed into Boer society. The Boers spoke [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]], a language or dialect derived from Dutch, and no longer called themselves Boers but [[Afrikaners]]. Some Khoikhoi were used as [[commando]]s in raids against other Khoikhoi and later Xhosa. A mixed Khoi, slave, and European population called the [[Cape Coloureds]], who were outcasts within colonial society, also arose. Khoikhoi who lived far on the frontier included the Kora, [[Oorlams creole|Oorlams]], and [[Griqua people|Griqua]]. In 1795, the British took over the cape colony from the Dutch.<ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 215\u2013216.</ref>\n\nIn the 1830s, Boers embarked on a journey of expansion, east of the [[Great Fish River]] into the Zuurveld. They were referred to as ''[[Voortrekkers]]''. They founded republics of the [[South African Republic|Transvaal]] and [[Orange Free State]], mostly in areas of sparse population that had been diminished by the ''[[Mfecane|Mfecane/Difaqane]]''. Unlike the Khoisan, the Bantu states were not conquered by the Afrikaners, because of population density and greater unity. Additionally, they began to arm themselves with guns acquired through trade at the cape. In some cases, as in the [[Xhosa Wars|Xhosa/Boer Wars]], Boers were removed from [[Xhosa people|Xhosa]] lands. It required a dedicated imperial military force to subdue the Bantu-speaking states. In 1901, the Boer republics were defeated by Britain in the [[Second Boer War]]. The defeat however consummated many Afrikaners' ambition: South Africa would be under white rule. The British placed all power\u2014legislative, executive, administrative\u2014in English and Afrikaner hands.<ref name=\"Davidson 1991, pp. 274\u2013275\"/><ref>Shillington (2005), pp. 268\u2013271.</ref>\n\n===European trade, exploration and conquest===\n{{Further|European exploration of Africa|African slave trade|Scramble for Africa}}\n[[File:Maxim machine gun Megapixie.jpg|thumb|right|250px|1895 .303 tripod mounted Maxim machine gun]]\nBetween 1878 and 1898, European states partitioned and conquered most of Africa. For 400 years, European nations had mainly limited their involvement to trading stations on the African coast. Few dared venture inland from the coast; those that did, like the Portuguese, often met defeats and had to retreat to the coast. Several technological innovations helped to overcome this 400-year pattern. One was the development of [[repeating rifle]]s, which were easier and quicker to load than [[musket]]s. [[Artillery]] was being used increasingly. In 1885, [[Hiram S. Maxim]] developed the [[maxim gun]], the model of the modern-day [[machine gun]]. European states kept these weapons largely among themselves by refusing to sell these weapons to African leaders.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 268\u2013269.</ref>\n\nAfrican germs took numerous European lives and deterred permanent settlements. Diseases such as [[yellow fever]], [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]], [[yaws]], and [[leprosy]] made Africa a very inhospitable place for Europeans. The deadliest disease was [[malaria]], endemic throughout [[Tropical Africa]]. In 1854, the discovery of [[quinine]] and other medical innovations helped to make conquest and colonization in Africa possible.<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 269.</ref>\n\nStrong motives for conquest of Africa were at play. Raw materials were needed for European factories. Europe in the early part of the 19th century was undergoing its [[Industrial Revolution]]. Nationalist rivalries and prestige were at play. Acquiring African colonies would show rivals that a nation was powerful and significant. These factors culminated in the [[Scramble for Africa]].<ref>Collins and Burns (2007), p. 265.</ref>\n\n[[File:David Livingstone attacked by a lion in Africa. Lithograph.

The most famous of the explorers was [[David Livingstone]], who explored southern Africa and traversed the continent from the Atlantic at [[Luanda]] to the Indian Ocean at [[Quelimane]].

It was agreed that European claims to parts of Africa would only be recognised if Europeans provided effective occupation. In a series of treaties in 1890\u20131891, colonial boundaries were completely drawn. All of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] was claimed by European powers, except for Ethiopia (Abyssinia) and [[Liberia]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nThe European powers set up a variety of different administrations in Africa, reflecting different ambitions and degrees of power. In some areas, such as parts of [[British West Africa]], colonial control was tenuous and intended for simple economic extraction, strategic power, or as part of a long-term development plan. In other areas, Europeans were encouraged to settle, creating settler states in which a European minority dominated. Settlers only came to a few colonies in sufficient numbers to have a strong impact. British settler colonies included [[British East Africa]] (now Kenya), [[Northern Rhodesia|Northern]] and [[Southern Rhodesia]], ([[Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe]], respectively), and [[South Africa]], which already had a significant population of European settlers, the [[Boer]]s. France planned to settle [[French Algeria|Algeria]] and eventually incorporate it into the French state on an equal basis with the European provinces. Algeria's proximity across the Mediterranean allowed plans of this scale.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nIn most areas colonial administrations did not have the manpower or resources to fully administer the territory and had to rely on local power structures to help them. Various factions and groups within the societies exploited this European requirement for their own purposes, attempting to gain positions of power within their own communities by cooperating with Europeans. One aspect of this struggle included what [[Terence Ranger]] has termed the \"invention of tradition.\" In order to legitimize their own claims to power in the eyes of both the colonial administrators and their own people, native elites would essentially manufacture \"traditional\" claims to power, or ceremonies. As a result, many societies were thrown into disarray by the new order.{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\nFollowing the [[Scramble for Africa]], an early but secondary focus for most [[colony|colonial]] [[regime]]s was the suppression of slavery and the slave trade.

They ruled until after World War II when forces of nationalism grew much stronger. In the 1950s and 1960s the colonial holdings became independent states. The process was usually peaceful but there were several long bitter bloody civil wars, as in Algeria,<ref>Alistair Horne, ''A savage war of peace: Algeria 1954\u20131962'' (1977).</ref> Kenya<ref>David Anderson, ''Histories of the hanged: The dirty war in Kenya and the end of empire'' (2005).</ref> and elsewhere. Across Africa the powerful new force of [[nationalism]] drew upon the organizational skills that natives learned in the British and French and other armies in the world wars. It led to organizations that were not controlled by or endorsed by either the colonial powers not the traditional local power structures that were collaborating with the colonial powers. Nationalistic organizations began to challenge both the traditional and the new colonial structures and finally displaced them. Leaders of nationalist movements took control when the European authorities exited; many ruled for decades or until they died off. These structures included political, educational, religious, and other social organizations. In recent decades, many African countries have undergone the triumph and defeat of nationalistic fervor, changing in the process the loci of the centralizing state power and patrimonial state.<ref>Gabriel Almond and James S.

Darstellung von Carl Arriens.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Ngomano]] in November 1917]]\nWith the vast majority of the continent under the colonial control of European governments, the World Wars were significant events in the geopolitical history of Africa.  Africa was a theater of war and saw fighting in both wars.  More important in most regions, the [[total war]] footing of colonial powers impacted the governance of African colonies, through resource allocation, conscription, and taxation.  In [[World War I]] there were several campaigns in Africa, including the [[Togoland Campaign]], the [[Kamerun Campaign]], the [[South West Africa campaign]], and the [[East African Campaign (World War I)|East African campaign]].  In each, Allied forces, primarily British, but also French, Belgian, South African, and Portuguese, sought to force the Germans out of their African colonies.  In each, German forces were badly outnumbered and, due to Allied naval superiority, were cut off from reinforcement or resupply.  The Allies eventually conquered all German colonies; German forces in East Africa managed to avoid surrender throughout the war, though they could not hold any territory after 1917. After World War I, [[List of former German colonies|former German colonies]] in Africa were taken over by France, Belgium, and the British Empire.\n\nAfter World War I, colonial powers continued to consolidate their control over their African territories.  In some areas, particularly in Southern and East Africa, large settler populations were successful in pressing for additional devolution of administration, so-called \"home rule\" by the white settlers.  In many cases, settler regimes were harsher on African populations, tending to see them more as a threat to political power, as opposed to colonial regimes which had generally endeavored to co-opt local populations into economic production.  The [[Great Depression]] strongly affected Africa's non-subsistence economy, much of which was based on commodity production for Western markets.  As demand increased in the late 1930s, Africa's economy rebounded as well.\n\nAfrica was the site of one of the first instances of [[fascist]] territorial expansions in the 1930s.  Italy had attempted to conquer Ethiopia in the 1890s but had been rebuffed in the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War]].  Ethiopia lay between two Italian colonies, [[Italian Somaliland]] and [[Eritrea]] and was invaded in October 1935.  With an overwhelming advantage in [[armor]] and aircraft, by May 1936, Italian forces had occupied the capital of [[Addis Ababa]] and effectively declared victory. Ethiopia and their other colonies were consolidated into [[Italian East Africa]].\n\n===World War II: Political===\n[[File:Map of Africa in 1939.png|thumb|right|Areas controlled by European powers in 1939.

Vichy was in control until the Free French prevailed in late 1942. Portuguese (brown) and Spanish (teal) colonies remained neutral.]]\n\nAfrica was a large continent whose geography gave it strategic importance during the war. North Africa was the scene of major British and American campaigns against Italy and Germany; East Africa was the scene of a major British campaign against Italy.  The vast geography provided major transportation routes linking the United States to the Middle East and Mediterranean regions. The sea route around South Africa was heavily used even though it added 40 days to voyages that had to avoid the dangerous Suez region. Lend Lease supplies to Russia often came this way. Internally, long-distance road and railroad connections facilitated the British war effort. The Union of Africa had dominion status and was largely self-governing, the other British possessions were ruled by the colonial office, usually with close ties to local chiefs and kings. Italian holdings were the target of successful British military campaigns. The Belgian Congo, and two other Belgian colonies, were major exporters. In terms of numbers and wealth, the British -controlled the richest portions of Africa, and made extensive use not only of the geography, but the manpower, and the natural resources.  Civilian colonial officials made a special effort to upgrade the African infrastructure, promote agriculture, integrate colonial Africa with the world economy, and recruit over a half million soldiers.<ref>Ashley Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 171\u2013239.</ref><ref>David Killingray and Richard Rathbone, edfs. ''Africa and the Second World War'' (1986).</ref>\n\nBefore the war, Britain had made few plans for the utilization of Africa, but it quickly set up command structures. The Army set up the West Africa Command, which recruited 200,000 soldiers. The East Africa Command was created in September 1941 to support the overstretched Middle East Command.  It provided the largest number of men, over 320,000, chiefly from Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda. The Southern Command was the domain of South Africa. The Royal Navy set up the South Atlantic Command based in Sierra Leone, that became one of the main convoy assembly points. The RAF Coastal Command had major submarine-hunting operations based in West Africa, while a smaller RAF command Dealt with submarines in the Indian Ocean. Ferrying aircraft from North America and Britain was the major mission of the Western Desert Air Force. In addition smaller more localized commands were set up throughout the war.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) 175\u2013177.</ref>\n\nBefore 1939, the military establishments were very small throughout British Africa, and largely consisted of whites, who comprised under two percent of the population outside South Africa. As soon as the war began, newly created African units were set up, primarily by the Army.  The new recruits were almost always volunteers, usually provided in close cooperation with local tribal leaders. During the war, military pay scales far exceeded what civilians natives could earn, especially when food, housing and clothing allowances are included. The largest numbers were in construction units, called Pioneer units, with over 82,000 soldiers.. The RAF and Navy also did some recruiting. The volunteers did some fighting, a great deal of guard duty, and construction work. 80,000 served in the Middle East. A special effort was made not to challenge white supremacy, certainly before the war, and to a large extent during the war itself. Nevertheless, the soldiers were drilled and train to European standards, given strong doses of propaganda, and learn leadership and organizational skills that proved essential to the formation of nationalistic and independence movements after 1945. There were minor episodes of discontent, but nothing serious, among the natives.<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp. 180\u2013189.</ref> Afrikaner nationalism was a factor in South Africa, But the proto-German Afrikaner prime minister was replaced in 1939 by [[Jan Smuts]], an Afrikaner who was an enthusiastic supporter of the British Empire. His government closely cooperated with London and raised 340,000 volunteers (190,000 were white, or about one-third of the eligible white men).<ref>Jackson, ''The British Empire and the Second World War '' (2006) pp. 240\u2013245.</ref>\n\n====French Africa====\nAs early as 1857, the French established volunteer units of black soldiers in sub- Sahara Africa, termed the ''tirailleurs senegalais.'' They served in military operations throughout the Empire, including 171,000 soldiers in World War I and 160,000 in World War II.<ref>Robert Aldrich, ''Greater France: A History of French Overseas Expansion'' (1996) p. 223.</ref>  About 90,000 became POWs in Germany.

De Gaulle finally won out.<ref>Arthur Layton Funk, ''Charles de Gaulle: the crucial years, 1943\u20131944'' (1959).</ref>\n\n===World War II: Military===\n\nSince Germany had lost its African colonies following World War I, World War II did not reach Africa until [[Pact of Steel|Italy joined the war]] on June 10, 1940, controlling Libya and Italian East Africa.  With the [[fall of France]] on June 25, most of France's colonies in North and West Africa were controlled by the [[Vichy government]], though much of Central Africa fell under [[Free French]] control after some fighting between Vichy and Free French forces at the [[Battle of Dakar]] and the [[Battle of Gabon]]. After the fall of France, Africa was the only active theater for ground combat until the [[Italian invasion of Greece]] in October.  In the [[Western Desert campaign]] Italian forces from Libya sought to overrun Egypt, controlled by the British.  Simultaneously, in the [[East African Campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]], Italian East African forces overran [[British Somaliland]] and some British outposts in [[Kenya]] and [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan]].  When Italy's efforts to conquer Egypt (including the crucial [[Suez Canal]]) and Sudan fell short, they were unable to reestablish supply to Italian East Africa. Without the ability to reinforce or resupply and surrounded by Allied possessions, Italian East Africa was conquered by mainly British and South African forces in 1941. In North Africa, the Italians soon requested help from the Germans who sent a substantial force under General [[Rommel]].  With German help, the Axis forces regained the upper hand but were unable to break through British defenses in two tries at [[El Alamein]].  In late 1942, Allied forces, mainly Americans and Canadians, invaded French North Africa in [[Operation Torch]], where Vichy French forces initially surprised them with their resistance but were convinced to stop fighting after three days.  The second front relieved pressure on the British in Egypt who began pushing west to meet up with the Torch forces, eventually pinning German and Italian forces in [[Tunisia]], which was conquered by May 1943 in the [[Tunisia campaign]], ending the war in Africa. The only other significant operations occurred in the French colony of Madagascar, which was invaded by the British in May 1942 to deny its ports to the Axis (potentially the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] who had reached the eastern Indian Ocean).  The French garrisons in Madagascar surrendered in November 1942.\n\n===Post-war Africa: decolonization===\n{{further|Historical African place names|Decolonisation of Africa|Neocolonialism}}\n[[File:Africa independence dates.svg|thumb|right|250px|Dates of independence of African countries]]\n\nThe [[decolonization of Africa]] started with [[Libya]] in 1951, although [[Liberia]], [[South Africa]], [[Egypt]] and [[Ethiopia]] were already independent. Many countries followed in the 1950s and 1960s, with a peak in 1960 with the [[Year of Africa]], which saw 17 African nations declare independence, including a large part of [[French West Africa]]. Most of the remaining countries gained independence throughout the 1960s, although some colonizers (Portugal in particular) were reluctant to relinquish sovereignty, resulting in bitter wars of independence which lasted for a decade or more. The last African countries to gain formal independence were [[Guinea-Bissau]] (1974), [[Mozambique]] (1975) and [[Angola]] (1975) from Portugal; [[Djibouti]] from France in 1977; [[Zimbabwe]] from the United Kingdom in 1980; and [[Namibia]] from South Africa in 1990.
