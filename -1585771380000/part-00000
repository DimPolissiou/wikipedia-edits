Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting. The Swedish police registers one offence for each person raped, and if one and the same person has been raped on a number of occasions, one offence is counted for each occasion that can be specified. For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a month, the Swedish police may record more than 30 cases of rape. In many other countries only a single offence would be counted in such a situation.<ref name=\"BBC1\">{{cite web|last=Ruth|first=Alexander|title=Sweden's rape rate under the spotlight|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19592372|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 April 2014|date=14 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"VonHofer\" /><ref name=\"method\">{{cite web|title=Rape and Human Rights in the Nordic Countries |url=http://www.amnesty.dk/sites/default/files/mediafiles/44/case-closed.pdf |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=14 May 2014 |page=145 |date=2008 |quote=The Swedish mode of recording is sometimes referred to as 'extensive counting', since the crime statistics cover reported acts of rape.

Until 1984, rape was only prosecuted in cases where the victim was prepared to press charges, with an additional restriction of a six months time limit. This resulted in numerous cases of rape and sexual assault going [[under-reporting|unreported]].<ref name=\"VonHofer\" />\n\nThe Swedish prosecution system is governed by the [[principle of legality]] and the \"equality principle\", which means that as a rule, the police and the prosecution service are required to register and prosecute all offences of which they become aware. This can be assumed to lead to a more frequent registration of offences than in systems with the inverse \"expediency principle\", where the classification of offences is negotiable on the basis of [[plea bargaining]], and the prosecutor has the right not to prosecute, even when a prosecution would be technically possible.<ref name=\"VonHofer\" /><ref name=\"Roxell-Tiby\" /> English speaking [[common law]] countries operate an [[adversarial system]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tonry|first1=Michael|title=The Oxford handbook of crime and criminal justice|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-539508-2|page=3}}</ref>\n\n=== Substantive factors ===\n\nWillingness to report crime also affects the statistics.<ref name=\"explained-official\" /> In countries where rape remains associated with a strong taboo and a high level of shame, the propensity to report such offences probably tends to be lower than in countries characterized by a higher level of sexual equality.

For example, a 2008 ruling by the [[Supreme Court of Sweden|Supreme Court]] decided that [[Fingering (sexual act)|digital penetration]] of the vagina, on a woman who is intoxicated or sleeping, shall be regarded as a sexual act comparable to sexual intercourse, and is therefore an act of rape.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sammanst\u00e4llning av r\u00e4ttspraxis i sexualbrottsm\u00e5l|url=http://www.aklagare.se/PageFiles/4049/2010-04%20sexualbrott%20sammanst%C3%A4llning.pdf|publisher=[[Swedish Prosecution Authority]]|accessdate=30 March 2015|language=Swedish|format=August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=NJA 2008 s. 482|url=https://lagen.nu/dom/nja/2008s482|publisher=lagen.nu|accessdate=30 March 2015|language=Swedish}}</ref>\n\n== Swedish rape statistics ==\n\nEver since the [[collation]] of [[crime statistics]] was initiated by the [[Council of Europe]], Sweden has had the highest number of registered rape offences in Europe by a considerable extent.

Other countries may employ more restrictive methods of counting. The Swedish police registers one offence for each person raped, and if one and the same person has been raped on a number of occasions, one offence is counted for each occasion that can be specified. For example, if a woman says she has been raped by her husband every day during a month, the Swedish police may record more than 30 cases of rape. In many other countries only a single offence would be counted in such a situation.<ref name=\"BBC1\">{{cite web|last=Ruth|first=Alexander|title=Sweden's rape rate under the spotlight|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-19592372|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=29 April 2014|date=14 September 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"VonHofer\" /><ref name=\"method\">{{cite web|title=Rape and Human Rights in the Nordic Countries |url=http://www.amnesty.dk/sites/default/files/mediafiles/44/case-closed.pdf |publisher=[[Amnesty International]] |accessdate=14 May 2014 |page=145 |date=2008 |quote=The Swedish mode of recording is sometimes referred to as 'extensive counting', since the crime statistics cover reported acts of rape.

Until 1984, rape was only prosecuted in cases where the victim was prepared to press charges, with an additional restriction of a six months time limit. This resulted in numerous cases of rape and sexual assault going [[under-reporting|unreported]].<ref name=\"VonHofer\" />\n\nThe Swedish prosecution system is governed by the [[principle of legality]] and the \"equality principle\", which means that as a rule, the police and the prosecution service are required to register and prosecute all offences of which they become aware. This can be assumed to lead to a more frequent registration of offences than in systems with the inverse \"expediency principle\", where the classification of offences is negotiable on the basis of [[plea bargaining]], and the prosecutor has the right not to prosecute, even when a prosecution would be technically possible.<ref name=\"VonHofer\" /><ref name=\"Roxell-Tiby\" /> English speaking [[common law]] countries operate an [[adversarial system]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Tonry|first1=Michael|title=The Oxford handbook of crime and criminal justice|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-539508-2|page=3}}</ref>\n\n=== Substantive factors ===\n\nWillingness to report crime also affects the statistics.<ref name=\"explained-official\" /> In countries where rape remains associated with a strong taboo and a high level of shame, the propensity to report such offences probably tends to be lower than in countries characterized by a higher level of sexual equality.

Their music is known for its brand of \"minimalistic [[psychedelia]]\".<ref name=\"amg\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/spacemen-3-mn0000005251/biography|title=Spacemen 3 &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nSpacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and going on to have greater success towards the end of the decade.<ref name=\"amg\"/><ref name=\"Lazell\">Lazell, Barry (1997) ''Indie Hits 1980\u20131989'', Cherry Red Books, {{ISBN|0-9517206-9-4}}, p. 213</ref> However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. \n\nThey gained a reputation as a 'drug band' due to the members' drug-taking habits and Kember's candid interviews and outspoken opinions on [[recreational drug use]].<ref name=\"Vox-recurring\">''Vox'', Spring 1991.</ref> Kember and Pierce were the only members common to all line-ups of the band.

They met at the (now defunct) Rugby Art College on Clifton Road,  [[Rugby, Warwickshire]] <ref name =\"Rugby Art College\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby-local-history.org.uk/news2.html|title=Rugby News Reel|website=Rugby-local-history.org.uk|accessdate=25 June 2016}}</ref> in Autumn 1982, both aged 16, and became close friends.  Pierce was in a band called Indian Scalp, but he left them near the end of 1982 in order to collaborate with Kember. The two guitarists recruited drummer Tim Morris, who played with a couple of other bands and had a rehearsal space at his parental home which they used. Shortly afterwards they were joined by an acquaintance, [[The Darkside|Pete Bain]], on bass. Morris and Bain had previously played together in a band called Noise on Independent Street. Pierce handled lead vocal duties. Now a 4-piece, the band originally adopted the name The Spacemen. Their first live performances occurred around winter 1982/83, playing at a party and then at a couple of gigs they managed to get at a local bar; at the latter their set included a 20-minute version of the one-chord song \"O.D. Catastrophe\".<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\">''Forced Exposure'', Issue 14, Autumn 1988</ref>{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=19, 38\u201350}}<ref name=\"outer limits\">''Outer Limits'', Spacemen 3 fan magazine, Issues 1 & 2, 1991.

This prompted Bain and Morris to leave and join a new local band, The Push, being formed by Gavin Wissen. Kember and Pierce recruited a replacement drummer, Nicholas \"Natty\" Brooker. They continued without a bassist and Pierce would regularly return to Rugby for rehearsals. In early 1984, they only performed at a few local, low key venues. Still a trio, they changed their name to Spacemen 3.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=51\u201355}}<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> Kember explained:\n\n{{cquote|The \"3\" came about completely by mistake. We did a poster which was just for The Spacemen, which we were for a while. But it was \"The\" Spacemen and I hated that, it sounded like a 50s rock 'n' roll group \u2013 that's all very well, but we didn't want to be imagined as\u2026one of those surf bands. So we stuck the 3 on afterwards \u2013 that came about from a poster we did which had \"Are Your Dreams At Night 3 Sizes Too Big?\" with a very big 3 on it and it really worked as a logo, it just fell into place. It's really for the [[third eye]].<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/>}}\n\nDespite having played fewer than ten gigs, Spacemen 3 decided to produce a [[demo tape]]. In 1984 they made their first studio recordings at the home [[Recording studio|studio]] of Dave Sheriff in Rugby. This material \u2013 which included early iterations of the songs \"Walkin' with Jesus\", \"Come Down Easy\" and \"Thing'll Never be the Same\" \u2013 was used for a short demo tape entitled ''[[For All the Fucked Up Children|For All The Fucked Up Children Of The World We Give You Spacemen 3]]''. They got a few hundred cassette copies made and produced their own artwork and booklet to accompany it, selling the tapes for \u00a31 at a local record shop.<ref name=\"outer limits\"/> Spacemen 3's music at this stage had a loose, swampy Blues feel; some songs included harmonica and slide guitar, and their style sounded akin to [[The Cramps]].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=55\u201357}} These early demo recordings, which Kember later recalled as being \"really dreadful\",<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/> would later be released unofficially in 1995 on the [[Sympathy for the Record Industry]] label, thus providing an insight into the band's embryonic sound.<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\nAround 1984 and 1985, Spacemen 3 were doing gigs every two or three months on the local Rugby/[[Northampton]]/[[Coventry]] circuit, and had a regular spot at The Black Lion [[public house]] in Northampton.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=58}} Their gigs had an 'anti performance' element: Kember and Pierce would play their guitars sitting down and would barely acknowledge the audience. They would illuminate the stage with some cheap, old optokinetic disco light-show equipment which they had acquired, providing a [[psychedelic art|psychedelic]] backdrop.<ref name=\"amg\"/>{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=64}}<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> Kember:\n\n{{cquote|We went out of our way to control our audience.

Around this time they started to co-host a weekly club night together with another local band, Gavin Wissen's 'The Cogs of Tyme'. 'The Reverberation Club', as it was called, was held at The Blitz public house in Rugby on Thursdays. \"50s, 60s and 70s punk\" records were played and it soon provided a live venue for Spacemen 3 and various other local bands.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=61\u201365}}<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alteredzones.com/posts/1234/artist-profile-sonic-boom/ |title=Artist Profile: Sonic Boom |website=Altered Zones |accessdate=2011-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903014859/http://alteredzones.com/posts/1234/artist-profile-sonic-boom/ |archivedate=3 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }} alteredzones.com, 2011 \u2013 interview with Peter Kember</ref> At one of their gigs at The Black Lion in 1985, they came to the attention of [[Pat Fish]], the leader of the recording band [[The Jazz Butcher]]; he felt Spacemen 3 were \"extraordinary\" and \"like nothing else\".{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=59\u201360}}<ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\n===''Sound of Confusion'' era (1986)===\n\n===='Northampton Demos'====\nIn November 1985, Spacemen 3 played a gig at a leisure centre in [[Coventry]] to an audience of fewer than ten people.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=67\u201368}} Nevertheless, encouraged by the support of Pat Fish, they determined that they ought to record a new [[demo tape]].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=70}} By this time they had reconfigured and honed their musical style, and their repertoire consisted of newer songs and re-worked older ones. \"The band's sound had crystallised into the intense, hypnotic, overloaded psychedelia which characterised their early [record] output, and which would serve as a template for their live act throughout their existence\" (Ian Edmond, ''[[Record Collector]]'').<ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nAt Pierce's instigation, [[The Darkside|Pete Bain]] rejoined the band on bass in order to fill out their sound. Despite being a 4-piece again, they would retain the name 'Spacemen 3'.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=70\u201371}} Kember and Pierce opted to upgrade their guitar equipment ahead of recording the new demos. Kember purchased a Burns Jazz [[electric guitar]] and 1960s Vox Conqueror [[amplifier]]; whilst Pierce bought a [[Fender Telecaster]] and a 1970s HH amplifier. Both of their new amplifiers included distortion/fuzz and [[tremolo]]; these two effects were key components of Spacemen 3's signature sound.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=71\u201372}}<ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nIn January 1986, Spacemen 3 attended the Studio Morocco based at the home of Carlo Marocco at Piddington, outside [[Northampton]], to record their new demo tape. They spent three-and-a-half days at the [[16-track]] studio. Recording live as a group, with minimal [[overdubs]], they managed to get demos for approximately seven songs. Kember and Pierce handled the [[music production|production]].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=72\u201375}}<ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref>Album liner notes \u2013 ''Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To'' reissue (Bomp!, 1995)</ref> with studio manager Dave Howard dealing with the technicalities.

[[Pat Fish]] had given a copy of the demo tape to Dave Barker, the owner of the [[independent record label]] Glass Records, to whom Fish's band [[The Jazz Butcher]] were signed.  Spacemen 3 signed a three-year, two-album recording contract with [[Glass Records]] in early 1986.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=77, 87}}<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref>''Sounds'', 09/02/1991</ref>\n\n====Debut album====\nSpacemen 3 were sent to record their first album, ''[[Sound of Confusion]]'', at the studios of Bob Lamb in the [[King's Heath]] area of [[Birmingham]].  By this time, they had already started to write some 'softer' songs, but they decided that the album should consist entirely of 'heavier', older material. With a recording budget of less than \u00a31,000, they completed the album in five days, with the last two days dedicated to mixing. Attempts at recording the title song \"Walkin' with Jesus (Sound of Confusion)\" were unsuccessful and abandoned.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=87\u201391}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Album liner notes, ''Sound of Confusion'' 1994 re-release</ref>\n\nIt was originally intended that Pat Fish would produce the album, but due to his touring commitments with his band, The Jazz Butcher, it was instead produced by Bob Lamb.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=87}} However, Lamb refused to allow Kember or Pierce near the production desk. Kember would later reveal, \"He [Lamb] had no affinity with our type of music at all and was quite domineering\". Both Kember and Pierce were unhappy with the production on the album, feeling it suffered from Lamb's unsympathetic production; they later said they much preferred their versions on the Northampton demo tape.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=91}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe seven-track ''Sound of Confusion'' album had a heavy psychedelic style with a strong [[The Stooges|Stooges]] influence. It was \"a full on, fuzzed up drone of relentless guitar pounding\" (Ian Edmond, ''Record Collector''),<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> with a \"rough garage energy \" and \"minimal, bluntly entrancing riffs\" (Ned Raggett, ''AllMusic'').<ref name=\"amg\"/> A ''[[NME]]'' review of the 1990 re-release recalled of the album: \"It's a lo-fi, mostly low-key affair, the sound of the band finding their feet... It doesn't quite attain the critical mass to transcend its basis in the most rudimentary garage punk of the Sixties... Side Two is pretty much one long tribute to The Stooges... ''Sound of Confusion'' probably felt like a revelation, to the few who heard it at the time.\"<ref>''NME'', 1990 \u2013 'Sound of Confusion' (re-release) review by Simon Reynolds.</ref>\n\n''Sound of Confusion'' was released in July 1986. The cover artwork included shots of the band illuminated by their light-show equipment. The album was not received well, making little impression at the time, although it went on to reach no. 2 on the [[UK Independent Chart]] in 1989.<ref name=\"Lazell\" /> Publicity for the album suffered from lack of funding by Glass Records.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=92, 96}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nDuring 1986, Spacemen 3 made live performances every few weeks. These continued to occur at local venues, with the exception of gigs in Chesterfield, Birmingham and, in August, their first appearance in London. The latter gig saw them receive their first reviews in both ''NME'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=96}}\n\n{{Quote|Spacemen 3 are practitioners in the fine art of repetition; instinctively drawing on the lessons of their forefathers and adding an atmosphere, a mood and a sonorous backbeat of their own... they take hold of a chord and work every last permutation out of it before calmly working through to the next.| ''NME'': concert review, The Clarendon, Hammersmith, London, August 1986.<ref>''NME'', 16/8/1986 \u2013 concert review, The Clarendon, Hammersmith, London, August 1986</ref>}}\n\nTo follow up their album, Spacemen 3 made their first single: \"Walkin' with Jesus\". This was recorded at Carlo Marocco's studio outside Northampton. For the title track they re-mixed the version they had previously recorded for their demo tape. For the B-side, they recorded \"Feel So Good\", a newer composition, and re-recorded a 17-minute \"Rollercoaster\" (a cover of the [[13th Floor Elevators]]). This single was the first Spacemen 3 record that Peter Kember and Jason Pierce produced; the duo handled all future production. The \"Walkin' with Jesus\" single was released in November 1986. It received decent reviews from ''NME'' and ''Sounds'', and peaked at no. 29 on the UK Independent Chart, and no.&nbsp;46 in the indie chart published by ''Sounds''.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=97\u201398}}<ref name=\"Lazell\" /><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nIt was in 1986 that guitarist Peter Kember started to use his long-term alias 'Sonic Boom'. He had earlier employed the aliases 'Mainliner' and 'Peter Gunn'. Bassist Pete Bain also adopted his alias: 'Bassman' or 'Pete Bassman'.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=19}}\n\nTowards the end of 1986 the behaviour of Spacemen 3's drummer, Natty Brooker, became increasingly eccentric and bizarre. His refusal to wear shoes, even when playing the bass drum, led to arguments and Brooker left the band. [[Sterling Roswell|Stewart 'Rosco' Roswell]], a housemate of Pierce's and Brooker's, was recruited as the latter's replacement. Although Roswell was originally only a temporary appointment and was not a recognised drummer at the outset, he remained in the band for over a year.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=101\u2013102}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\n===''The Perfect Prescription'' era (1987\u201388)===\n====1987====\nIn January 1987, Spacemen 3 commenced work on their second album, ''[[The Perfect Prescription]]''. This was recorded at Paul Atkins' VHF Studios, near Rugby. VHF had been recommended to the band by in-house [[sound engineer]] Graham Walker with whom they had worked previously when recording their first demo tape. The first set of demo recordings they made at VHF Studios relating to the new album were dubbed the 'Out Of It Sessions'. Procurable only as [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]], this work shows the transition in Spacemen 3's musical style that was occurring around winter 1986/87.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=107\u2013108}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nVHF Studios' [[Multitrack recording|8-track]] facilities needed updating though, and a deal was agreed that Spacemen 3 would receive a large amount of studio time in return for financing new [[16-track]] recording and mixing equipment at VHF, at a cost of around \u00a33,000. Spacemen 3 would spend over eight months at VHF Studios. Importantly, this allowed them generous time to experiment, and develop and refine their sound and material in a studio setting, assisted by Graham Walker.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=108\u2013112}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> In the album [[liner notes]] of ''Forged Prescriptions'', a re-release of ''The Perfect Prescription'', Kember recalled:\n\n{{cquote|This is Spacemen 3 in bloom, midsummer before the seeds were scattered, right at the point where we worked together well and in compliment to each other. I still have strong memories of days where we would crash out listening to nothing but one song over and over... Mattresses were installed into the studio's lounging space and our kaleidoscopic light show stayed on throughout the session... We spent several months...recording and re-working these pieces until we felt they were ready, slowly learning more about the studio and its techniques as we went.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">album liner notes, ''Forged Prescriptions'', ''The Perfect Prescription'' re-release.</ref>}}\n\nWhilst working on the album, \"Transparent Radiation\" \u2014 a cover of a song by the [[Red Crayola]] \u2014 was recorded, and released as a single in July 1987. \"Transparent Radiation\" was awarded 'Single of the Week' by ''Sounds'', and matched the previous single in reaching no. 29 on the independent chart.<ref name=\"Lazell\" /><ref>''Sounds'', Autumn 1987</ref> The B-side included \"Ecstasy Symphony\", a new experimental piece using an [[organ (music)|organ]] drone multi-tracked and fed through various [[audio signal processing|effects]] (this would presage some of Peter Kember's later work and his interest in analogue [[synthesisers]]).{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=111, 127\u2013130}}<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\n''The Perfect Prescription'' was completed in September 1987 and released the same month.\nKember described it as \"kind of a concept album, it's about our better and worse experiences with drugs\".<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/> Produced by Kember and Pierce, they agreed to restrict the amount of guitar overdubs in order that it would be easier to replicate the songs live.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\"/> ''The Perfect Prescription'' received little critical attention in the UK, being better received in the United States. However, it represented Kember and Pierce's \"collaborative zenith\" (Erik Morse),{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=132\u2013133}} and the album \"is practically a best-of in all but name\" (Ned Raggett, ''AllMusic'').\n\n''The Perfect Prescription'' \"marked a serious artistic development, drawing deeper from gospel, ambient, and spiritual music, granting a serenity and depth to their spaced-out garage psychedelia\" (Stephen Erlewine, ''AllMusic'').<ref name=\"amg\"/> Although retaining the same minimalist approach, Spacemen 3's sound was now sparser and mellower. Extra textures and complexity were evident, provided by [[overdubs]] and additional [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], with the [[organ (music)|organ]] sound of the VHF Studio's [[Farfisa]] being a significant introduction. The instrumental palette was also extended with [[acoustic guitar]], [[violin]] (from local musician Owen John), [[saxophone]] and [[trumpet]] (from members of [[The Jazz Butcher]]) being used on some songs. Much of the album did not feature drums. This was the first album on which Kember contributed lead vocals.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=124\u2013127}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nSpacemen 3 performed live on about twenty occasions during 1987.

Comprising nearly thirty gigs, the tour saw tensions and discontent arise between band members. After they returned to England, drummer Stewart Roswell quit.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=138\u2013150, 154\u2013155}}<ref name=\"spacemen3.co.uk GIGS\"/>\n\nRelations between Peter Kember and Jason Pierce were beginning to suffer as a result of Pierce's romantic relationship with [[Kate Radley]], whom he had been dating since Summer 1987. Kember resented the amount of time his song-writing partner was spending with her at his expense.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=138\u2013150}}\n\nA UK [[Concert tour|tour]] in Spring 1988 used stand-in drummers to fulfil live dates. Roswell's departure was followed by that of Pete Bain at the end of May. A replacement bassist was immediately appointed: [[Will Carruthers]], a friend of the band who had recently been playing in another Rugby group, 'The Cogs of Tyme'.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=155, 169}}\n\nIn July 1988, Spacemen 3's third single, \"Take Me to the Other Side\", was released, from ''The Perfect Prescription'' album. The single received good press and was ''NME''{{'s}} Single of the Week.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=180}}\n\nSpacemen 3 were keen to be freed from their recording contract with Glass Records who were in financial difficulty and owed them royalties. Although they had produced the requisite two albums, there was still a year remaining on their contract. A deal was reached whereby, in return for providing a live album, their contractual obligations would be deemed to have been met and they would be allowed to leave. Accordingly, [[Performance (Spacemen 3 album)|''Performance'']] was released in July 1988. This seven-track live album was a recording of their gig at the [[Melkweg]] venue, Amsterdam, on 6 February 1988. (Three previously unreleased songs were excluded.){{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=161\u2013163}}\n\nFollowing their departure from Glass Records, Spacemen 3 were without a record deal. The only offer they received was from the prominent independent label [[Creation Records]]. However, Creation owner [[Alan McGee]] \u2013 a keen fan of the band \u2013 was only able to offer a one-album deal and with no advance. This was not pursued.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=163\u2013164}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/nov/02/alanmcgeefriampic|title=Oh go on, Jason Pierce, give us another classic|first=Alan|last=McGee|date=2 November 2007|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\nIt was at this juncture that Kember and Pierce chose to enter into a contractual relationship with Gerald Palmer, a [[Northamptonshire]] businessman and concert promoter who had already been functioning recently as Spacemen 3's ''[[de facto]]'' manager. This tripartite business partnership had the following terms: Palmer would own the [[master tapes]] of all future recordings, the rights of which would be licensed to [[record labels]] for release; touring and recording costs etc. would be financed by Palmer, who would give Kember and Pierce an advance of \u00a31,000 each; and, in return, all profits would be split 50:50: 50% for Palmer, and 50% for Kember and Pierce and other band members. Significantly, this contract was only with Kember and Pierce, meaning Spacemen 3 as a legal and financial entity would, in essence, constitute only the two of them together with Palmer. In addition, Palmer became Spacemen 3's manager.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=157\u2013166}}\n\n===''Playing with Fire'' era (1988\u201389)===\n====1988====\nPeter Kember had purchased an unusual electric guitar near the end of 1987: a Vox Starstream made in the late 1960s. This guitar incorporated several in-built effects, including fuzz and Repeat Percussion (or Repeater).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voxshowroom.com/us/guitar/starsrteam.html|title=The VOX Showroom - Vox V269 Starstream and V270 Starstream XII Guitars|website=Voxshowroom.com}}</ref> The latter was a unique [[tremolo]] type, almost [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]]-like effect, and Kember would use it heavily on Spacemen 3's future output. One of his first compositions featuring this effect was the eponymous \"Repeater\" (a.k.a. \"How Does It Feel?\"). \"Repeater\" and two other new songs also composed by Kember \u2013 \"Revolution\" and \"Suicide\" \u2013 were debuted on the European tour in early 1988. All three songs would feature on the next studio album, [[Playing with Fire (Spacemen 3 album)|''Playing With Fire'']]. Around Spring 1988 Kember was using his 4-track recorder to develop his ideas and several songs for the next album.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=146\u2013147, 166\u2013167}}\n\nRecording for Spacemen 3's third studio album, ''Playing With Fire'', started in June 1988. Their new manager, Gerald Palmer, booked ARK Studios in [[Cornwall]] for a month. These sessions were not particularly productive however and they left a week early. ARK Studios only had 8-track facilities and some of Spacemen 3's recordings were accidentally wiped by the in-house sound engineer. Rough demos were managed for Kember's \"Honey\" and Pierce's \"Lord Can You Hear Me?\". They still did not have a drummer at this point.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=170\u2013172, 187}}\n\nNew bassist Will Carruthers made his first live appearance with Spacemen 3 at London [[Dingwalls]] on 20 June, where they were supported by [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]. It was after this gig that a confrontation occurred between Kember and Pierce and his girlfriend, Kate Radley. Tired of Radley's persistent presence around the band of late \u2013 at recording sessions, touring and backstage at gigs  \u2013 Kember enforced an agreed 'no girls on the bus' policy and barred Radley from boarding the tour van, leaving Pierce and Radley to find their own way home.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=155, 180}}<ref name=\"spacemen3.co.uk GIGS\"/>\n\nRecording for ''Playing With Fire'' recommenced; they returned to VHF Studios, outside Rugby, where they had recorded ''The Perfect Prescription''. By now, song-writing duo Peter Kember and Jason Pierce were formulating new song ideas entirely separate from one another. Both their personal and working relationships were beginning to disintegrate. Pierce's romance with Kate Radley was impacting on his time with the band and his contributions. Of the eventual tracks on ''Playing With Fire'', six were Kember's compositions, whilst only three were Pierce's. The  recording process for this album was different: individual parts were recorded separately, which meant band members did not have to be present at the same time.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=173\u2013178}}\n\nOn 19 August, Spacemen 3 gave an unusual live performance. Palmer had booked them to provide 'An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music' in the foyer of the [[Watermans Arts Centre|Waterman's Art Centre]] in Brentford, London, to act as a prelude to a screening of the film ''[[Wings of Desire]]''. Kember, Pierce and Carruthers were joined by Rugby musician Steve Evans. They played a 45-minute [[jam session|jam]], based around a single chord strummed by Evans, featuring riffs from some of the songs from their as yet unreleased ''Playing With Fire'' material. This performance was recorded and was later released, in 1990, as [[Dreamweapon: An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music|''Dreamweapon'']].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=2\u20134, 191}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref name=\"spacemen3.co.uk GIGS\"/> The crowd assembled for the film was not impressed, and according to Pat Fish one of the patrons remarked to the other: \"To think that Elvis died for this!\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spacemen 3 & The Birth of Spiritualized|last=Morse|first=Erik|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2004|isbn=0711996024|location=|pages=4}}</ref>\n\nAfter initial plans to use drummers from [[The Weather Prophets]] and [[Thee Hypnotics]] for the recording of ''Playing With Fire'',<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/> a permanent drummer was recruited in late August: [[Jonny Mattock]]. Despite this he does not appear on ''Playing With Fire'' \u2013 a drum machine was used on all of the songs and no drummer is credited on the album. Mattock had been playing in a Northampton band called 'The Apple Creation'. He was recommended by future Spacemen 3 guitarist [[Slipstream (band)|Mark Refoy]]. Mattock made his live debut on 24 August at a gig at the Riverside in Hammersmith, London, and contributed to the new album. The new rhythm section of Carruthers and Mattock would remain constant for the rest of Spacemen 3's existence.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=190\u2013191}}\n\nIn Summer 1988, Spacemen 3 managed to obtain a two-album deal with independent label, [[Fire Records (UK)|Fire Records]].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=182\u2013183}} Kember and Pierce argued over the choice of song for their first single with Fire. Agreement was eventually reached on \"Revolution\". At a gig 15 November 1988, advertised as 'Sonic Boom and Jason of Spacemen 3', only Kember and Carruthers performed; Pierce spent the whole time at the bar with Kate Radley, whom he was now living with.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=180, 200\u2013201}}<ref name=\"spacemen3.co.uk GIGS\"/>\n\nThe single \"Revolution\" was released in November 1988. The title track was a powerful, anthemic \"mind-melting crunch\" (Ned Raggett, ''AllMusic''). \"'Revolution' was the chest-tearing noise that propelled them from complete obscurity to the cultosphere of young indie rock godz\" (Jack Barron, ''NME'', 29/7/1989). The single peaked in the top 10 of the indie charts, representing Spacemen 3's highest chart position yet, and was voted by radio listeners for inclusion in [[John Peel]]'s end-of-year [[Festive Fifty]]. Awarded Single of the Week by the ''[[Melody Maker]]'', it was extremely well received by the music press whose general attitude towards the band changed at this juncture:{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=192\u2013193}}\n\n{{quote|[\"Revolution\"] is one of the best records released by an independent band this year.

On one occasion, Kember invited his interviewer to accompany him as he collected his [[methadone]] prescription.<ref name=\"Melody Maker, 19/11/1988\"/> Kember was regularly described in the music papers, incorrectly, as the \"leader\" of Spacemen 3, although he had not helped in this portrayal: in the Melody Maker article referred to above, Kember had stated: \"This band is my design and the rest are totally into it.\"<ref name=\"Melody Maker, 19/11/1988\"/>{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=195\u2013196}}<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"Conflict48\"/><ref name=\"NME, 29/7/1989\">''NME'', 29/7/1989</ref><ref name=\"NME, 29/7/1989\"/><ref name=\"NME, Summer 1988\">''NME'', Summer 1988</ref><ref name=\"Sounds, 05/12/1988\">''Sounds'', 05/12/1988</ref><ref name=\"Lime Lizard, April 1989\">''Lime Lizard'', April 1989</ref><ref>''OffBEAT'', 07/03/1989</ref><ref>''Sounds'', 11/3/1989</ref><ref name=\"Sniffin\"/>\n\nCompletion of the ''Playing With Fire'' album was delayed due to recording delays and a dispute about song-writing credits. At a meeting at Fire Records' London office, Peter Kember proffered his name for single writing credits for six of the album's nine songs; however, Jason Pierce countered, demanding joint credits for three of those songs due to the guitar parts he had contributed to them. An argument led to Kember attempting to hit Pierce and a scuffle ensued. An impasse resulted; Pierce threatened to pull his songs from the album if his demands were not met. Manager Gerald Palmer mediated to resolve the feud. At a very tense four-hour meeting, of fierce arguments and recriminations between Kember and Pierce, Palmer finally managed to obtain a compromise with Kember conceding split song-writing credits for 'Suicide'.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=186\u2013189}}\n\n====Sonic Boom solo project====\nIn late 1988, Peter Kember was already working on new material for post ''Playing With Fire''. His productivity meant he had a surfeit of songs, and he advised his bandmates of his intention to produce a solo album. New [[Independent music|indie]] label [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone Records]] offered Kember a generous one-off album deal which he accepted. Kember finished recordings for his debut solo album and single in March 1989, prior to the commencement of Spacemen 3's European tour. Other members of Spacemen 3, including Pierce, as well as other musicians, had contributed sessions. Release of Kember's solo album (''Spectrum'') and single \u2013 under the moniker of Kember's alias, Sonic Boom \u2013 were put on hold in order to avoid a marketing clash with ''Playing With Fire''.<ref name=\"amg\"/>{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=198\u2013201}}\n\n====1989: ''Playing With Fire'' album release and tour====\nSpacemen 3's eagerly awaited ''Playing With Fire'' album was finally released on 27 February 1989.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=205}} The album's front cover sleeve bore the slogan, \"Purity, Love, Suicide, Accuracy, Revolution\". ''Playing With Fire'' was Spacemen 3's first record to chart and one of the breakthrough indie albums of the year. Within weeks of its release, it was No.&nbsp;1 in both the ''NME'' and ''Melody Maker'' indie charts. It was \"their most critically and commercially successful album\" (Stephen Erlewine, ''AllMusic'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/artists/a/spacemen3.htm |author=Anthony Carew |title= Spacemen 3 - Artist Profile: Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To |website=About.com Alternative Music |access-date=13 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217192848/http://altmusic.about.com/od/artists/a/spacemen3.htm |archive-date=17 December 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Reviews were extremely positive and the album garnered wide critical acclaim:{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=209}}\n\n{{Quote|It is a curious, brave, intriguing record, quite unlike anything that you're likely to hear elsewhere.

After several gigs, Kember told Pierce this could not continue. For the rest of the UK dates Pierce and Radley, now living in a new flat together, made their own way to gigs.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=204\u2013208}}\n\nThe UK tour was shortly followed by an extensive and gruelling four-week tour of continental Europe in April\u2013May 1989. This incorporated 22 dates across the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, Austria and Italy. (Radley was not present on this tour.) [[Setlists]] remained more or less consistent around this period. For the purposes of live performances, Spacemen 3 played their more powerful or heavier \u2013 and therefore mostly older \u2013 songs, featuring little from ''Playing With Fire''; although the odd softer song was played occasionally. Sets typically ended with the song \"Suicide\" which could last up to 45 minutes.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=216\u2013225}}<ref name=\"spacemen3.co.uk GIGS\"/>\n\n===Break-up, final album, and formation of Spiritualized (1989\u201391)===\n\n====1989====\nAt the beginning of 1989 Spacemen 3 had been one of the \"hottest indie bands in England\" (Erik Morse){{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=213}} and were gaining the attention of major US record labels. However, despite their success in winter 1988\u201389, their prospects were very different less than a year later. The personal and working relationship between Peter Kember and Jason Pierce, still the principal members of the band, would completely disintegrate, leading Spacemen 3 to eventually disband.\n\nSpacemen 3 used the short break between the UK and European tours in Spring 1989 as an opportunity to record a new single. Two songs were recorded, at VHF Studios: \"Hypnotized\", a new song by Pierce, who had recently acquired his own 4-track recorder; and \"Just To See You Smile\", by Kember. The songwriters spent a day's session on each other's song, although Kember's contribution to \"Hypnotized\" was not ultimately used. Kember accused Pierce of copying his sounds; he felt the flutter multi-tap [[reverb]] on \"Hypnotized\" was the same as he had employed on \"Honey\" and \"Let Me Down Gently\" on ''Playing With Fire''.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=214\u2013216}}\n\nWhilst Spacemen 3 were on tour in Europe in April\u2013May 1989, manager Gerald Palmer prepared the new single for release. Without consulting Kember or Pierce, Palmer mastered the tracks, had the sleeve artwork designed, and selected \"Hypnotized\" for the A-side. When Kember found out he was furious; however, Palmer refused to postpone the pressing of the single. A resulting feud permanently damaged Kember and Palmer's working relationship.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=224\u2013225, 232\u2013234}}\n\nWhen Spacemen 3 returned to England from their European tour at the end of May 1989, there was tension between Kember and Pierce. In June, Spacemen 3 played ten UK gigs. Initially, Pierce was making his own way to these dates, but when he instead used the tour van there was a bad atmosphere between the two men.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=225\u2013227, 230\u2013232}}\n\nThe single [[Hypnotized (Spacemen 3 song)|\"Hypnotized\"]] was released on 3 July 1989. It was their \"most anticipated release yet\" (Erik Morse) and immediately charted inside the top 10 of the ''NME'' and ''Melody Maker'' indie charts. It was ''Sounds'' Single of the Week. After two weeks, ''Hypnotized'' reached No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Melody Maker'' indie chart, and No.&nbsp;2 on the ''NME'' indie chart (second only to [[The Stone Roses]]' \"[[She Bangs The Drums]]\"). It was voted No.&nbsp;33 in [[John Peel]]'s end of year [[Festive Fifty]].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=233\u2013234}}\n\nA third guitarist, [[Slipstream (band)|Mark Refoy]], had been recruited at the beginning of Summer 1989, to play on later live dates and work on the next album. Refoy had been a friend and keen fan of the band for several years, and had contributed to Kember's solo album. He was guitarist in the indie band 'The Tell-tale Hearts' who had disbanded in 1987. Refoy made his first live performance with Spacemen 3 at their Rugby 'homecoming' gig on 20 July.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=230, 235}}\n\nOn 23 July, Spacemen 3 played their biggest headlining gig at [[The Town & Country Club]], London, a 2,000-capacity venue. On 22 August, they played a warm-up gig at Subterranea, London, for the Reading Festival, their first festival gig. Spacemen 3 played at the [[Reading Festival]] on 25 August 1989. This would transpire to be their last ever live performance.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=235\u2013236, 238\u2013239}}\n\nAt the beginning of September 1989, Spacemen 3 were about to undertake a substantial tour of the United States \u2013 despite disagreement between Kember and Pierce as to whether Kate Radley could accompany them. The tour schedule had been finalised and they were due to be in America for the rest of the year, playing about 50 gigs.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=234,241\u2013242}} The band had grievances with their manager Gerald Palmer, such as perceived lack of monies being received, and summoned him to a meeting at VHF Studios. The meeting, which was secretly recorded, involved intense arguments and accusations, and nothing was resolved.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=242\u2013244}} In an interview in 1991, Kember described Palmer as \"the most devious guy I've ever had the misfortune to meet\".<ref name=\"Vox-april1991\">''Vox'', April 1991</ref>\n\nA few days later Kember and Pierce met Palmer again and sacked him. However, Palmer's partnership agreement with Kember and Pierce meant that he was contractually still effectively one third of Spacemen 3. Palmer had already incurred at least \u00a310,000 in recording expenses for the next album. In response to his dismissal as manager, he decided to withdraw his commitment to finance the imminent US tour, which was therefore cancelled at the eleventh hour. Tour posters had already been printed. The considerable time and money Bomp! Records' Greg Shaw had expended in preparing the tour was wasted.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=234,241\u2013245}}\n\nThe official explanation at the time \u2013 and that reported in the UK music press \u2013 was that the US tour had been cancelled because they had not been able to obtain work permits due to the drug convictions of band members. However, it has since transpired that this was not the case: work permits had been obtained for the band, albeit with difficulty.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=241, 244\u2013245}}\n\nRecording for Spacemen 3's fourth studio album, ''[[Recurring (album)|Recurring]]'', had commenced at the beginning of August 1989, again at VHF Studios. According to Mark Refoy, Kember and Pierce rarely appeared at the studio at the same time and there was \"quite a tense atmosphere\" between them. When work recommenced after the Reading Festival, Kember and Pierce were recording separately from one another. Pierce contributed guitar parts to Kember's songs, but Kember did not play on any of Pierce's songs. When Kember heard Pierce's demos, he again renewed his claim that he was copying his sounds and effects, and accused Pierce's \"Billy Whizz\" of being a composition he had written several years prior. The two were now estranged and working completely separately. They agreed to have separate sides of the album for their own songs, all of which they had written and composed individually. Pierce's side of the album is effectively his next project 'Spiritualized', and Kember's side of effectively his next project 'Spectrum' with Richard Formby Kember's partner in Spectrum playing guitar on his side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Spacemen-3-Recurring/release/541723|title=Spacemen 3 - Recurring|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Spectrum-Soul-Kiss-Glide-Divine/master/32822|title=Spectrum (4) - Soul Kiss (Glide Divine)|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> The other three band members \u2013 Carruthers, Mattock and Refoy \u2013 who all went onto join Spiritualized, were called in to contribute sessions when required.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=237, 241\u2013242, 246\u2013250}}\n\nIn late September, Kember made a solo performance at a gig supporting [[The Telescopes]]. Kember and Pierce agreed to be in the studio together to record a cover of [[Mudhoney]]'s \"When Tomorrow Hits\", for a prospective split single with Mudhoney. When Kember heard Mudhoney's version of \"Revolution\", with altered lyrics, he was offended and this collaborative [[Sub Pop]] release was called off however. The recording of \"When Tomorrow Hits\" was the last occasion Kember and Pierce would work together. A disconsolate Will Carruthers left the band at this point, fed up with the discord and lack of remuneration.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=252\u2013254}}\n\nRecording for the album proceeded slowly and was still ongoing in Autumn 1989, by which point Kember had used two to three times the amount of studio time as Pierce. According to band members, Kember's behaviour was becoming increasingly obsessive and erratic. He was regularly missing booked studio slots.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=241, 247\u2013252}} In late October, Kember's debut solo single, \"Angel\" was released. It received a lukewarm reception.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=254}}\n\nOn 14 November 1989, the four remaining Spacemen 3 band members met to discuss finishing the album and arranging future live dates. The meeting was unproductive. Reportedly, Kember and Pierce both said little. Jonny Mattock told Kember he was difficult to work with. Mattock and Mark Refoy, both peeved, left the meeting prematurely and effectively resigned from Spacemen 3. In December, Gerald Palmer attempted to mediate between his business partners, Kember and Pierce, meeting them individually because Pierce reportedly refused contact with Kember.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=258\u2013260}}\n\n====Dedicated record deal====\n\nDuring 1989, Gerald Palmer had been courting interest and offers from US major record labels. Palmer had been postponing a decision hoping the US tour would lever improved offers. Negotiations with [[Dedicated Records]], a satellite label of [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], had been ongoing for several months. The poor intra-band relations had remained secret for the sake of outward appearance. By October 1989, the latest offer from Dedicated was a five-album, multimillion-dollar deal, with a \u00a360,000 advance. Palmer had expended \u00a315,000 on legal fees, and because he had managed to negotiate out the standard [[Leaving Member Clause]], Kember and Pierce were in a '[[win-win situation]]'.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=234\u2013235, 240\u2013241, 246, 261\u2013262}}\n\nIn December, the three met to arrange signing the Dedicated record deal. Pierce insisted that Kember sign an agreement stating that the two of them had equal rights to Spacemen 3, to mutually protect them by preventing either party potentially claiming ownership of the Spacemen 3 name should the other quit. Coerced by the attraction of his portion of the Dedicated advance, Kember signed it. Mattock claims Kember attacked Pierce in the street the next morning. At the beginning of 1990, Kember and Pierce attended the London offices of Dedicated separately to sign the record contract. A few days later, at a dinner (at the Paper Tiger Chinese restaurant in Lutterworth, Leicestershire) with Dedicated executives, Kember and Pierce were cordial with the other guests but didn't talk with one another. The pretence was kept up until the end; Palmer did not inform Dedicated about the band breaking up until March.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=261\u2013264, 268\u2013269}}\n\n====1990====\nIn late 1989, Jason Pierce, dissatisfied with his mixes at VHF Studios, took his recordings for the ''Recurring'' album to Battery Studios, London. Assisted by engineer/producer [[Anjali Dutt]], Pierce completed final [[remixes]] of his songs in January 1990. However, Peter Kember's side of the album was far from ready, and he resorted to calling on the help of [[Richard Formby]], a producer. According to Formby, when he arrived, Kember's recording was only half done; some songs were incomplete, and two had to be re-recorded from scratch.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=254\u2013255, 265\u2013267}}\n\nIn January 1990, Kember's side project and debut solo album, ''Spectrum'' (Sonic Boom), was released. Recorded nearly a year previously, Kember had used the project as a vehicle for a group of melancholic themed songs, having decided to save his more upbeat work for Spacemen 3 and ''Recurring''.<ref name=\"Sniffin\"/><ref>Peter Kember \u2013 TV interview, 1991</ref> The ''Spectrum'' album was advertised as being by the \"founder member/leader of Spacemen 3\".{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=266}}\n\nAlso in January, Pierce was developing ideas for forming a new band or side project of his own. He invited Spacemen 3 compatriots, Refoy, Carruthers and Mattock, to jam and rehearse with him at a small church hall and his flat. Initially it was informal, but this was the origin of Pierce's Spacemen 3 'splinter' band, [[Spiritualized]], comprising all the same members as Spacemen 3 except for Kember. In February 1990, this new grouping recorded \"Anyway That You Want Me\". This was recorded at VHF Studios; the purpose of these sessions was kept secret from Kember who was still working there.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=264\u2013268}} Speaking in 1991, Pierce explained the purpose of starting Spiritualized:\n\n{{cquote|It was so as though I could get back on the road again. Pete [Kember] was still doing tracks for ''Recurring'', and it was a long way off Spacemen 3 touring again, so I wanted to do another tour. So, initially, it [Spiritualized] was set up as a means to get back on the road.<ref>Jason Pierce \u2013 TV interview, c. Spring 1991.</ref>}}\n\nKember continued on completing his ''Recurring'' material. His indecision and constant remixing was prolonging the recording of the album. Gerald Palmer was still funding the studio time, and warned Kember to finish. Eventually, intolerant of any more delays, Palmer attended VHF Studios. He seized Kember's tapes, carrying out a previous threat, and chose the final mixes for release. There were reportedly dozens of different mixes for each song.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\nIn June 1990, Spiritualized released their debut single, \"Anyway That You Want Me\". This was a cover of a song by The Troggs which Spacemen 3 had demoed in 1988 during their ''Playing With Fire'' sessions. The single's cover sleeve, which had no text on it, controversially bore a sticker saying \"Spacemen 3\". Furthermore, adverts for the single featured the Spacemen 3 logo.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=264\u2013270}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nThe release of the Spiritualized single was the first Kember had definite knowledge of the band's existence.

They performed songs from the then as yet unreleased ''Recurring'', as well as new material. Spiritualized signed a record deal with Dedicated and recorded their debut album in Winter 1990/91.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=269\u2013271}}\n\n====1991====\nIn January 1991, the Spacemen 3 single \"Big City\"/\"Drive\" was released. Both songs from the double A-side single were from the soon-to-released ''Recurring''. Kember and Pierce had been due to be at the studio for the mastering of the single, however Pierce did not attend. At that point the two had hardly spoken face to face in over six months. Kember decided to fade out several minutes of Pierce's song from the single, \"Drive\".{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=272}}\n\nThe last Spacemen 3 album, ''[[Recurring (album)|Recurring]]'', was finally released in February 1991. Although the band had not officially disbanded, for all intents and purposes it was a posthumous release. The two sides of the album \u2013 one by Kember (A-side), the other by Pierce (B-side) \u2013 reflected the split between the band's two main personnel.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=272\u2013273}}\n\nThe songs on ''Recurring'' had been composed in 1989. It expanded on the sounds of the previous, ''Playing With Fire'' album. Musically, it was richer and lusher, but Kember and Pierce's respective halves of ''Recurring'' were distinctly different and presaged the solo material which they were already working on by the time of the album's release. Kember's side demonstrated his pop and ambient sensibilities; Pierce's side indicated his sympathy for gospel and blues music and his interest in lush production.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=214\u2013216, 237, 246\u2013247, 272\u2013273}}\n\n{{quote|Pierce's sound is more lyrical and dramatic, building songs into climaxes.

This minimalist musical approach typically represented compositions consisting of the repetition of simple riffs based around the progression of only two or three [[chord (music)|chords]], or simply using just one chord.

This material includes: live recordings; demos; earlier iterations of certain songs; alternate versions of many songs; some unfinished work; and some entirely previously unreleased songs. These releases have been both official and unofficial, and some have been issued by the Kember/Palmer-affiliated label [[Space Age Recordings]].\n\n''Losing Touch with Your Mind'', an unofficial release of 1991, was a compilation of alternate song versions and rare releases. The 1993 re-release of [[Dreamweapon: An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music|''Dreamweapon'']] on the Sympathy For The Record Industry label \u2013 which included the intriguing live 44-minute Eastern-inspired [[drone music]] performance at the Watermans Art Centre, Brentford, London, of August 1988 \u2013 was augmented with a previously unreleased recording of a jam.<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\n1995 saw the unofficial release of the band's first demo tape: ''For All the Fucked Up Children of This World We Give You Spacemen 3''. Dating to 1984, this provided an interesting insight into the band's earliest work and \"rougher\" sound. These recordings pre-dated the other early demos previously made available on the 1990 unofficial, Father Yod release entitled ''Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To''.\n\nThe 1994 re-release of the ''Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To'' (Northampton Demos) album included several previously unreleased alternate song versions and other bonus tracks.\n\nTwo live albums were released in 1995: ''Live In Europe 1989'' (also released in 1995 as ''Spacemen Are Go!'' on the Bomp! label, but without 'Take Me to the Other Side' and an alternate take of 'Suicide') which represented the first release of the band's live work from their lengthy 1989 contintental tour; and ''Revolution or Heroin'', a bootleg of performances from the band's 1988 gig at the University of London Students Union. The former has been described as \"far better than the more ragged earlier Spacemen 3 live album, 1988's ''Performance''\" (Stewart Mason, ''AllMusic'').<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\nIn 1999, Spacemen 3's third studio album, [[Playing with Fire (Spacemen 3 album)|''Playing with Fire'']], was given a special, 10th-anniversary re-release. This official double disc release comprised all the original recordings together with previously unreleased alternate versions, demos and covers (e.g. The Perfect Disaster's \"Girl on Fire\" and The Troggs' \"Anyway That You Want Me\") from the same studio sessions. This re-release has been described as the \"definitive\"<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> version of the [[Playing with Fire (Spacemen 3 album)|''Playing with Fire'']] album.\n\nIn 2004, Spacemen 3's second studio album, ''[[The Perfect Prescription]]'', was also given the special re-release treatment. The double disc official release, entitled ''[[Forged Prescriptions]]'', comprised alternate mixes of the original album tracks together with previously unreleased alternate versions, demos and covers (e.g. The Spades' \"We Sell Soul\" and The Troggs' \"I Want You\") from the same studio sessions. Kember's liner notes explain that the alternative mixes represent the more multi-layered versions which he and Pierce agreed not to use because they would be unable to satisfactorily reproduce their sound live.\n\nA [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] called the ''Out of it Sessions'' comprises demo recordings of early iterations of songs from ''[[The Perfect Prescription]]'' album.\n\nIn 2005, Kember produced and released his own limited edition, double disc album, ''How the Blues Should've Turned Out''. This wholly comprised previously unreleased material, including alternate versions, rough demos, unfinished work, etc.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Spiritualized]]\n*[[Peter Kember|Sonic Boom]]\n*[[Peter Kember#Spectrum|Spectrum]]\n*[[Peter Kember#E.A.R.|E.A.R.]]\n*[[The Darkside|Darkside]]\n*[[Slipstream (band)|Slipstream]]\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Biographies:'''\n* Morse, Erik (2005).

Their music is known for its brand of \"minimalistic [[psychedelia]]\".<ref name=\"amg\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/spacemen-3-mn0000005251/biography|title=Spacemen 3 &#124; Biography & History|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> \n\nSpacemen 3 had their first independent chart hits in 1987, gaining a cult following, and going on to have greater success towards the end of the decade.<ref name=\"amg\"/><ref name=\"Lazell\">Lazell, Barry (1997) ''Indie Hits 1980\u20131989'', Cherry Red Books, {{ISBN|0-9517206-9-4}}, p. 213</ref> However, they disbanded shortly afterwards, releasing their final studio album post-split in 1991 after an acrimonious parting of ways. \n\nThey gained a reputation as a 'drug band' due to the members' drug-taking habits and Kember's candid interviews and outspoken opinions on [[recreational drug use]].<ref name=\"Vox-recurring\">''Vox'', Spring 1991.</ref> Kember and Pierce were the only members common to all line-ups of the band. Both founding members have enjoyed considerable success with their respective subsequent projects: [[Peter Kember|Sonic Boom/Spectrum]] and [[Spiritualized]].\n\n==History==\n===Formation and early years (1982\u201385)===\nThe creative and song-writing force throughout Spacemen 3's history were [[Peter Kember]] and [[Jason Pierce]]. They met at the (now defunct) Rugby Art College on Clifton Road,  [[Rugby, Warwickshire]] <ref name =\"Rugby Art College\">{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby-local-history.org.uk/news2.html|title=Rugby News Reel|website=Rugby-local-history.org.uk|accessdate=25 June 2016}}</ref> in Autumn 1982, both aged 16, and became close friends.  Pierce was in a band called Indian Scalp, but he left them near the end of 1982 in order to collaborate with Kember. The two guitarists recruited drummer Tim Morris, who played with a couple of other bands and had a rehearsal space at his parental home which they used. Shortly afterwards they were joined by an acquaintance, [[The Darkside|Pete Bain]], on bass. Morris and Bain had previously played together in a band called Noise on Independent Street. Pierce handled lead vocal duties. Now a 4-piece, the band originally adopted the name The Spacemen. Their first live performances occurred around winter 1982/83, playing at a party and then at a couple of gigs they managed to get at a local bar; at the latter their set included a 20-minute version of the one-chord song \"O.D. Catastrophe\".<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\">''Forced Exposure'', Issue 14, Autumn 1988</ref>{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=19, 38\u201350}}<ref name=\"outer limits\">''Outer Limits'', Spacemen 3 fan magazine, Issues 1 & 2, 1991. Two-part article re: early history of Spacemen 3</ref><ref name=\"Record Collector\">''Record Collector'' magazine, Issue 285, May 2003 \u2013 Spacemen 3 feature, article</ref>\n\nIn Autumn 1983, Pierce, having finished his course at Rugby Art College, started attending an art school in [[Maidstone]], [[Kent]]. This prompted Bain and Morris to leave and join a new local band, The Push, being formed by Gavin Wissen. Kember and Pierce recruited a replacement drummer, Nicholas \"Natty\" Brooker. They continued without a bassist and Pierce would regularly return to Rugby for rehearsals. In early 1984, they only performed at a few local, low key venues. Still a trio, they changed their name to Spacemen 3.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=51\u201355}}<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> Kember explained:\n\n{{cquote|The \"3\" came about completely by mistake. We did a poster which was just for The Spacemen, which we were for a while. But it was \"The\" Spacemen and I hated that, it sounded like a 50s rock 'n' roll group \u2013 that's all very well, but we didn't want to be imagined as\u2026one of those surf bands. So we stuck the 3 on afterwards \u2013 that came about from a poster we did which had \"Are Your Dreams At Night 3 Sizes Too Big?\" with a very big 3 on it and it really worked as a logo, it just fell into place. It's really for the [[third eye]].<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/>}}\n\nDespite having played fewer than ten gigs, Spacemen 3 decided to produce a [[demo tape]]. In 1984 they made their first studio recordings at the home [[Recording studio|studio]] of Dave Sheriff in Rugby. This material \u2013 which included early iterations of the songs \"Walkin' with Jesus\", \"Come Down Easy\" and \"Thing'll Never be the Same\" \u2013 was used for a short demo tape entitled ''[[For All the Fucked Up Children|For All The Fucked Up Children Of The World We Give You Spacemen 3]]''. They got a few hundred cassette copies made and produced their own artwork and booklet to accompany it, selling the tapes for \u00a31 at a local record shop.<ref name=\"outer limits\"/> Spacemen 3's music at this stage had a loose, swampy Blues feel; some songs included harmonica and slide guitar, and their style sounded akin to [[The Cramps]].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=55\u201357}} These early demo recordings, which Kember later recalled as being \"really dreadful\",<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/> would later be released unofficially in 1995 on the [[Sympathy for the Record Industry]] label, thus providing an insight into the band's embryonic sound.<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\nAround 1984 and 1985, Spacemen 3 were doing gigs every two or three months on the local Rugby/[[Northampton]]/[[Coventry]] circuit, and had a regular spot at The Black Lion [[public house]] in Northampton.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=58}} Their gigs had an 'anti performance' element: Kember and Pierce would play their guitars sitting down and would barely acknowledge the audience.

'The Reverberation Club', as it was called, was held at The Blitz public house in Rugby on Thursdays. \"50s, 60s and 70s punk\" records were played and it soon provided a live venue for Spacemen 3 and various other local bands.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=61\u201365}}<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alteredzones.com/posts/1234/artist-profile-sonic-boom/ |title=Artist Profile: Sonic Boom |website=Altered Zones |accessdate=2011-09-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903014859/http://alteredzones.com/posts/1234/artist-profile-sonic-boom/ |archivedate=3 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }} alteredzones.com, 2011 \u2013 interview with Peter Kember</ref> At one of their gigs at The Black Lion in 1985, they came to the attention of [[Pat Fish]], the leader of the recording band [[The Jazz Butcher]]; he felt Spacemen 3 were \"extraordinary\" and \"like nothing else\".{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=59\u201360}}<ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\n===''Sound of Confusion'' era (1986)===\n\n===='Northampton Demos'====\nIn November 1985, Spacemen 3 played a gig at a leisure centre in [[Coventry]] to an audience of fewer than ten people.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=67\u201368}} Nevertheless, encouraged by the support of Pat Fish, they determined that they ought to record a new [[demo tape]].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=70}} By this time they had reconfigured and honed their musical style, and their repertoire consisted of newer songs and re-worked older ones. \"The band's sound had crystallised into the intense, hypnotic, overloaded psychedelia which characterised their early [record] output, and which would serve as a template for their live act throughout their existence\" (Ian Edmond, ''[[Record Collector]]'').<ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nAt Pierce's instigation, [[The Darkside|Pete Bain]] rejoined the band on bass in order to fill out their sound. Despite being a 4-piece again, they would retain the name 'Spacemen 3'.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=70\u201371}} Kember and Pierce opted to upgrade their guitar equipment ahead of recording the new demos. Kember purchased a Burns Jazz [[electric guitar]] and 1960s Vox Conqueror [[amplifier]]; whilst Pierce bought a [[Fender Telecaster]] and a 1970s HH amplifier. Both of their new amplifiers included distortion/fuzz and [[tremolo]]; these two effects were key components of Spacemen 3's signature sound.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=71\u201372}}<ref name=\"outer limits\"/><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nIn January 1986, Spacemen 3 attended the Studio Morocco based at the home of Carlo Marocco at Piddington, outside [[Northampton]], to record their new demo tape. They spent three-and-a-half days at the [[16-track]] studio. Recording live as a group, with minimal [[overdubs]], they managed to get demos for approximately seven songs.

By this time, they had already started to write some 'softer' songs, but they decided that the album should consist entirely of 'heavier', older material. With a recording budget of less than \u00a31,000, they completed the album in five days, with the last two days dedicated to mixing. Attempts at recording the title song \"Walkin' with Jesus (Sound of Confusion)\" were unsuccessful and abandoned.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=87\u201391}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Album liner notes, ''Sound of Confusion'' 1994 re-release</ref>\n\nIt was originally intended that Pat Fish would produce the album, but due to his touring commitments with his band, The Jazz Butcher, it was instead produced by Bob Lamb.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=87}} However, Lamb refused to allow Kember or Pierce near the production desk. Kember would later reveal, \"He [Lamb] had no affinity with our type of music at all and was quite domineering\". Both Kember and Pierce were unhappy with the production on the album, feeling it suffered from Lamb's unsympathetic production; they later said they much preferred their versions on the Northampton demo tape.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=91}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe seven-track ''Sound of Confusion'' album had a heavy psychedelic style with a strong [[The Stooges|Stooges]] influence. It was \"a full on, fuzzed up drone of relentless guitar pounding\" (Ian Edmond, ''Record Collector''),<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> with a \"rough garage energy \" and \"minimal, bluntly entrancing riffs\" (Ned Raggett, ''AllMusic'').<ref name=\"amg\"/> A ''[[NME]]'' review of the 1990 re-release recalled of the album: \"It's a lo-fi, mostly low-key affair, the sound of the band finding their feet... It doesn't quite attain the critical mass to transcend its basis in the most rudimentary garage punk of the Sixties... Side Two is pretty much one long tribute to The Stooges... ''Sound of Confusion'' probably felt like a revelation, to the few who heard it at the time.\"<ref>''NME'', 1990 \u2013 'Sound of Confusion' (re-release) review by Simon Reynolds.</ref>\n\n''Sound of Confusion'' was released in July 1986.

The album was not received well, making little impression at the time, although it went on to reach no. 2 on the [[UK Independent Chart]] in 1989.<ref name=\"Lazell\" /> Publicity for the album suffered from lack of funding by Glass Records.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=92, 96}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nDuring 1986, Spacemen 3 made live performances every few weeks. These continued to occur at local venues, with the exception of gigs in Chesterfield, Birmingham and, in August, their first appearance in London. The latter gig saw them receive their first reviews in both ''NME'' and ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]''.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=96}}\n\n{{Quote|Spacemen 3 are practitioners in the fine art of repetition; instinctively drawing on the lessons of their forefathers and adding an atmosphere, a mood and a sonorous backbeat of their own... they take hold of a chord and work every last permutation out of it before calmly working through to the next.| ''NME'': concert review, The Clarendon, Hammersmith, London, August 1986.<ref>''NME'', 16/8/1986 \u2013 concert review, The Clarendon, Hammersmith, London, August 1986</ref>}}\n\nTo follow up their album, Spacemen 3 made their first single: \"Walkin' with Jesus\". This was recorded at Carlo Marocco's studio outside Northampton. For the title track they re-mixed the version they had previously recorded for their demo tape. For the B-side, they recorded \"Feel So Good\", a newer composition, and re-recorded a 17-minute \"Rollercoaster\" (a cover of the [[13th Floor Elevators]]). This single was the first Spacemen 3 record that Peter Kember and Jason Pierce produced; the duo handled all future production. The \"Walkin' with Jesus\" single was released in November 1986. It received decent reviews from ''NME'' and ''Sounds'', and peaked at no. 29 on the UK Independent Chart, and no.&nbsp;46 in the indie chart published by ''Sounds''.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=97\u201398}}<ref name=\"Lazell\" /><ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nIt was in 1986 that guitarist Peter Kember started to use his long-term alias 'Sonic Boom'. He had earlier employed the aliases 'Mainliner' and 'Peter Gunn'. Bassist Pete Bain also adopted his alias: 'Bassman' or 'Pete Bassman'.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=19}}\n\nTowards the end of 1986 the behaviour of Spacemen 3's drummer, Natty Brooker, became increasingly eccentric and bizarre. His refusal to wear shoes, even when playing the bass drum, led to arguments and Brooker left the band. [[Sterling Roswell|Stewart 'Rosco' Roswell]], a housemate of Pierce's and Brooker's, was recruited as the latter's replacement. Although Roswell was originally only a temporary appointment and was not a recognised drummer at the outset, he remained in the band for over a year.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=101\u2013102}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\n===''The Perfect Prescription'' era (1987\u201388)===\n====1987====\nIn January 1987, Spacemen 3 commenced work on their second album, ''[[The Perfect Prescription]]''. This was recorded at Paul Atkins' VHF Studios, near Rugby. VHF had been recommended to the band by in-house [[sound engineer]] Graham Walker with whom they had worked previously when recording their first demo tape. The first set of demo recordings they made at VHF Studios relating to the new album were dubbed the 'Out Of It Sessions'. Procurable only as [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]], this work shows the transition in Spacemen 3's musical style that was occurring around winter 1986/87.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=107\u2013108}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nVHF Studios' [[Multitrack recording|8-track]] facilities needed updating though, and a deal was agreed that Spacemen 3 would receive a large amount of studio time in return for financing new [[16-track]] recording and mixing equipment at VHF, at a cost of around \u00a33,000. Spacemen 3 would spend over eight months at VHF Studios. Importantly, this allowed them generous time to experiment, and develop and refine their sound and material in a studio setting, assisted by Graham Walker.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=108\u2013112}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> In the album [[liner notes]] of ''Forged Prescriptions'', a re-release of ''The Perfect Prescription'', Kember recalled:\n\n{{cquote|This is Spacemen 3 in bloom, midsummer before the seeds were scattered, right at the point where we worked together well and in compliment to each other.

However, it represented Kember and Pierce's \"collaborative zenith\" (Erik Morse),{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=132\u2013133}} and the album \"is practically a best-of in all but name\" (Ned Raggett, ''AllMusic'').\n\n''The Perfect Prescription'' \"marked a serious artistic development, drawing deeper from gospel, ambient, and spiritual music, granting a serenity and depth to their spaced-out garage psychedelia\" (Stephen Erlewine, ''AllMusic'').<ref name=\"amg\"/> Although retaining the same minimalist approach, Spacemen 3's sound was now sparser and mellower. Extra textures and complexity were evident, provided by [[overdubs]] and additional [[instrumentation (music)|instrumentation]], with the [[organ (music)|organ]] sound of the VHF Studio's [[Farfisa]] being a significant introduction. The instrumental palette was also extended with [[acoustic guitar]], [[violin]] (from local musician Owen John), [[saxophone]] and [[trumpet]] (from members of [[The Jazz Butcher]]) being used on some songs. Much of the album did not feature drums. This was the first album on which Kember contributed lead vocals.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=124\u2013127}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nSpacemen 3 performed live on about twenty occasions during 1987.

Comprising nearly thirty gigs, the tour saw tensions and discontent arise between band members. After they returned to England, drummer Stewart Roswell quit.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=138\u2013150, 154\u2013155}}<ref name=\"spacemen3.co.uk GIGS\"/>\n\nRelations between Peter Kember and Jason Pierce were beginning to suffer as a result of Pierce's romantic relationship with [[Kate Radley]], whom he had been dating since Summer 1987. Kember resented the amount of time his song-writing partner was spending with her at his expense.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=138\u2013150}}\n\nA UK [[Concert tour|tour]] in Spring 1988 used stand-in drummers to fulfil live dates. Roswell's departure was followed by that of Pete Bain at the end of May. A replacement bassist was immediately appointed: [[Will Carruthers]], a friend of the band who had recently been playing in another Rugby group, 'The Cogs of Tyme'.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=155, 169}}\n\nIn July 1988, Spacemen 3's third single, \"Take Me to the Other Side\", was released, from ''The Perfect Prescription'' album. The single received good press and was ''NME''{{'s}} Single of the Week.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=180}}\n\nSpacemen 3 were keen to be freed from their recording contract with Glass Records who were in financial difficulty and owed them royalties. Although they had produced the requisite two albums, there was still a year remaining on their contract. A deal was reached whereby, in return for providing a live album, their contractual obligations would be deemed to have been met and they would be allowed to leave. Accordingly, [[Performance (Spacemen 3 album)|''Performance'']] was released in July 1988. This seven-track live album was a recording of their gig at the [[Melkweg]] venue, Amsterdam, on 6 February 1988. (Three previously unreleased songs were excluded.){{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=161\u2013163}}\n\nFollowing their departure from Glass Records, Spacemen 3 were without a record deal. The only offer they received was from the prominent independent label [[Creation Records]]. However, Creation owner [[Alan McGee]] \u2013 a keen fan of the band \u2013 was only able to offer a one-album deal and with no advance. This was not pursued.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=163\u2013164}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2007/nov/02/alanmcgeefriampic|title=Oh go on, Jason Pierce, give us another classic|first=Alan|last=McGee|date=2 November 2007|website=Theguardian.com}}</ref>\n\nIt was at this juncture that Kember and Pierce chose to enter into a contractual relationship with Gerald Palmer, a [[Northamptonshire]] businessman and concert promoter who had already been functioning recently as Spacemen 3's ''[[de facto]]'' manager. This tripartite business partnership had the following terms: Palmer would own the [[master tapes]] of all future recordings, the rights of which would be licensed to [[record labels]] for release; touring and recording costs etc. would be financed by Palmer, who would give Kember and Pierce an advance of \u00a31,000 each; and, in return, all profits would be split 50:50: 50% for Palmer, and 50% for Kember and Pierce and other band members. Significantly, this contract was only with Kember and Pierce, meaning Spacemen 3 as a legal and financial entity would, in essence, constitute only the two of them together with Palmer. In addition, Palmer became Spacemen 3's manager.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=157\u2013166}}\n\n===''Playing with Fire'' era (1988\u201389)===\n====1988====\nPeter Kember had purchased an unusual electric guitar near the end of 1987: a Vox Starstream made in the late 1960s. This guitar incorporated several in-built effects, including fuzz and Repeat Percussion (or Repeater).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.voxshowroom.com/us/guitar/starsrteam.html|title=The VOX Showroom - Vox V269 Starstream and V270 Starstream XII Guitars|website=Voxshowroom.com}}</ref> The latter was a unique [[tremolo]] type, almost [[Delay (audio effect)|delay]]-like effect, and Kember would use it heavily on Spacemen 3's future output. One of his first compositions featuring this effect was the eponymous \"Repeater\" (a.k.a. \"How Does It Feel?\"). \"Repeater\" and two other new songs also composed by Kember \u2013 \"Revolution\" and \"Suicide\" \u2013 were debuted on the European tour in early 1988. All three songs would feature on the next studio album, [[Playing with Fire (Spacemen 3 album)|''Playing With Fire'']]. Around Spring 1988 Kember was using his 4-track recorder to develop his ideas and several songs for the next album.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=146\u2013147, 166\u2013167}}\n\nRecording for Spacemen 3's third studio album, ''Playing With Fire'', started in June 1988. Their new manager, Gerald Palmer, booked ARK Studios in [[Cornwall]] for a month. These sessions were not particularly productive however and they left a week early. ARK Studios only had 8-track facilities and some of Spacemen 3's recordings were accidentally wiped by the in-house sound engineer. Rough demos were managed for Kember's \"Honey\" and Pierce's \"Lord Can You Hear Me?\". They still did not have a drummer at this point.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=170\u2013172, 187}}\n\nNew bassist Will Carruthers made his first live appearance with Spacemen 3 at London [[Dingwalls]] on 20 June, where they were supported by [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]. It was after this gig that a confrontation occurred between Kember and Pierce and his girlfriend, Kate Radley. Tired of Radley's persistent presence around the band of late \u2013 at recording sessions, touring and backstage at gigs  \u2013 Kember enforced an agreed 'no girls on the bus' policy and barred Radley from boarding the tour van, leaving Pierce and Radley to find their own way home.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=155, 180}}<ref name=\"spacemen3.co.uk GIGS\"/>\n\nRecording for ''Playing With Fire'' recommenced; they returned to VHF Studios, outside Rugby, where they had recorded ''The Perfect Prescription''. By now, song-writing duo Peter Kember and Jason Pierce were formulating new song ideas entirely separate from one another. Both their personal and working relationships were beginning to disintegrate. Pierce's romance with Kate Radley was impacting on his time with the band and his contributions. Of the eventual tracks on ''Playing With Fire'', six were Kember's compositions, whilst only three were Pierce's. The  recording process for this album was different: individual parts were recorded separately, which meant band members did not have to be present at the same time.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=173\u2013178}}\n\nOn 19 August, Spacemen 3 gave an unusual live performance. Palmer had booked them to provide 'An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music' in the foyer of the [[Watermans Arts Centre|Waterman's Art Centre]] in Brentford, London, to act as a prelude to a screening of the film ''[[Wings of Desire]]''. Kember, Pierce and Carruthers were joined by Rugby musician Steve Evans. They played a 45-minute [[jam session|jam]], based around a single chord strummed by Evans, featuring riffs from some of the songs from their as yet unreleased ''Playing With Fire'' material. This performance was recorded and was later released, in 1990, as [[Dreamweapon: An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music|''Dreamweapon'']].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=2\u20134, 191}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/><ref name=\"spacemen3.co.uk GIGS\"/> The crowd assembled for the film was not impressed, and according to Pat Fish one of the patrons remarked to the other: \"To think that Elvis died for this!\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spacemen 3 & The Birth of Spiritualized|last=Morse|first=Erik|publisher=Omnibus Press|year=2004|isbn=0711996024|location=|pages=4}}</ref>\n\nAfter initial plans to use drummers from [[The Weather Prophets]] and [[Thee Hypnotics]] for the recording of ''Playing With Fire'',<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/> a permanent drummer was recruited in late August: [[Jonny Mattock]]. Despite this he does not appear on ''Playing With Fire'' \u2013 a drum machine was used on all of the songs and no drummer is credited on the album. Mattock had been playing in a Northampton band called 'The Apple Creation'. He was recommended by future Spacemen 3 guitarist [[Slipstream (band)|Mark Refoy]]. Mattock made his live debut on 24 August at a gig at the Riverside in Hammersmith, London, and contributed to the new album. The new rhythm section of Carruthers and Mattock would remain constant for the rest of Spacemen 3's existence.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=190\u2013191}}\n\nIn Summer 1988, Spacemen 3 managed to obtain a two-album deal with independent label, [[Fire Records (UK)|Fire Records]].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=182\u2013183}} Kember and Pierce argued over the choice of song for their first single with Fire. Agreement was eventually reached on \"Revolution\". At a gig 15 November 1988, advertised as 'Sonic Boom and Jason of Spacemen 3', only Kember and Carruthers performed; Pierce spent the whole time at the bar with Kate Radley, whom he was now living with.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=180, 200\u2013201}}<ref name=\"spacemen3.co.uk GIGS\"/>\n\nThe single \"Revolution\" was released in November 1988.

The single peaked in the top 10 of the indie charts, representing Spacemen 3's highest chart position yet, and was voted by radio listeners for inclusion in [[John Peel]]'s end-of-year [[Festive Fifty]]. Awarded Single of the Week by the ''[[Melody Maker]]'', it was extremely well received by the music press whose general attitude towards the band changed at this juncture:{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=192\u2013193}}\n\n{{quote|[\"Revolution\"] is one of the best records released by an independent band this year.

On one occasion, Kember invited his interviewer to accompany him as he collected his [[methadone]] prescription.<ref name=\"Melody Maker, 19/11/1988\"/> Kember was regularly described in the music papers, incorrectly, as the \"leader\" of Spacemen 3, although he had not helped in this portrayal: in the Melody Maker article referred to above, Kember had stated: \"This band is my design and the rest are totally into it.\"<ref name=\"Melody Maker, 19/11/1988\"/>{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=195\u2013196}}<ref name=\"Forced Exposure\"/><ref name=\"Conflict48\"/><ref name=\"NME, 29/7/1989\">''NME'', 29/7/1989</ref><ref name=\"NME, 29/7/1989\"/><ref name=\"NME, Summer 1988\">''NME'', Summer 1988</ref><ref name=\"Sounds, 05/12/1988\">''Sounds'', 05/12/1988</ref><ref name=\"Lime Lizard, April 1989\">''Lime Lizard'', April 1989</ref><ref>''OffBEAT'', 07/03/1989</ref><ref>''Sounds'', 11/3/1989</ref><ref name=\"Sniffin\"/>\n\nCompletion of the ''Playing With Fire'' album was delayed due to recording delays and a dispute about song-writing credits. At a meeting at Fire Records' London office, Peter Kember proffered his name for single writing credits for six of the album's nine songs; however, Jason Pierce countered, demanding joint credits for three of those songs due to the guitar parts he had contributed to them. An argument led to Kember attempting to hit Pierce and a scuffle ensued. An impasse resulted; Pierce threatened to pull his songs from the album if his demands were not met. Manager Gerald Palmer mediated to resolve the feud. At a very tense four-hour meeting, of fierce arguments and recriminations between Kember and Pierce, Palmer finally managed to obtain a compromise with Kember conceding split song-writing credits for 'Suicide'.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=186\u2013189}}\n\n====Sonic Boom solo project====\nIn late 1988, Peter Kember was already working on new material for post ''Playing With Fire''. His productivity meant he had a surfeit of songs, and he advised his bandmates of his intention to produce a solo album. New [[Independent music|indie]] label [[Silvertone Records (1980)|Silvertone Records]] offered Kember a generous one-off album deal which he accepted. Kember finished recordings for his debut solo album and single in March 1989, prior to the commencement of Spacemen 3's European tour. Other members of Spacemen 3, including Pierce, as well as other musicians, had contributed sessions. Release of Kember's solo album (''Spectrum'') and single \u2013 under the moniker of Kember's alias, Sonic Boom \u2013 were put on hold in order to avoid a marketing clash with ''Playing With Fire''.<ref name=\"amg\"/>{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=198\u2013201}}\n\n====1989: ''Playing With Fire'' album release and tour====\nSpacemen 3's eagerly awaited ''Playing With Fire'' album was finally released on 27 February 1989.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=205}} The album's front cover sleeve bore the slogan, \"Purity, Love, Suicide, Accuracy, Revolution\". ''Playing With Fire'' was Spacemen 3's first record to chart and one of the breakthrough indie albums of the year. Within weeks of its release, it was No.&nbsp;1 in both the ''NME'' and ''Melody Maker'' indie charts. It was \"their most critically and commercially successful album\" (Stephen Erlewine, ''AllMusic'').<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://altmusic.about.com/od/artists/a/spacemen3.htm |author=Anthony Carew |title= Spacemen 3 - Artist Profile: Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To |website=About.com Alternative Music |access-date=13 September 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111217192848/http://altmusic.about.com/od/artists/a/spacemen3.htm |archive-date=17 December 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Reviews were extremely positive and the album garnered wide critical acclaim:{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=209}}\n\n{{Quote|It is a curious, brave, intriguing record, quite unlike anything that you're likely to hear elsewhere.

After several gigs, Kember told Pierce this could not continue. For the rest of the UK dates Pierce and Radley, now living in a new flat together, made their own way to gigs.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=204\u2013208}}\n\nThe UK tour was shortly followed by an extensive and gruelling four-week tour of continental Europe in April\u2013May 1989. This incorporated 22 dates across the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Hungary, Austria and Italy. (Radley was not present on this tour.) [[Setlists]] remained more or less consistent around this period. For the purposes of live performances, Spacemen 3 played their more powerful or heavier \u2013 and therefore mostly older \u2013 songs, featuring little from ''Playing With Fire''; although the odd softer song was played occasionally. Sets typically ended with the song \"Suicide\" which could last up to 45 minutes.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=216\u2013225}}<ref name=\"spacemen3.co.uk GIGS\"/>\n\n===Break-up, final album, and formation of Spiritualized (1989\u201391)===\n\n====1989====\nAt the beginning of 1989 Spacemen 3 had been one of the \"hottest indie bands in England\" (Erik Morse){{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=213}} and were gaining the attention of major US record labels. However, despite their success in winter 1988\u201389, their prospects were very different less than a year later. The personal and working relationship between Peter Kember and Jason Pierce, still the principal members of the band, would completely disintegrate, leading Spacemen 3 to eventually disband.\n\nSpacemen 3 used the short break between the UK and European tours in Spring 1989 as an opportunity to record a new single. Two songs were recorded, at VHF Studios: \"Hypnotized\", a new song by Pierce, who had recently acquired his own 4-track recorder; and \"Just To See You Smile\", by Kember. The songwriters spent a day's session on each other's song, although Kember's contribution to \"Hypnotized\" was not ultimately used. Kember accused Pierce of copying his sounds; he felt the flutter multi-tap [[reverb]] on \"Hypnotized\" was the same as he had employed on \"Honey\" and \"Let Me Down Gently\" on ''Playing With Fire''.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=214\u2013216}}\n\nWhilst Spacemen 3 were on tour in Europe in April\u2013May 1989, manager Gerald Palmer prepared the new single for release. Without consulting Kember or Pierce, Palmer mastered the tracks, had the sleeve artwork designed, and selected \"Hypnotized\" for the A-side. When Kember found out he was furious; however, Palmer refused to postpone the pressing of the single. A resulting feud permanently damaged Kember and Palmer's working relationship.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=224\u2013225, 232\u2013234}}\n\nWhen Spacemen 3 returned to England from their European tour at the end of May 1989, there was tension between Kember and Pierce. In June, Spacemen 3 played ten UK gigs. Initially, Pierce was making his own way to these dates, but when he instead used the tour van there was a bad atmosphere between the two men.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=225\u2013227, 230\u2013232}}\n\nThe single [[Hypnotized (Spacemen 3 song)|\"Hypnotized\"]] was released on 3 July 1989. It was their \"most anticipated release yet\" (Erik Morse) and immediately charted inside the top 10 of the ''NME'' and ''Melody Maker'' indie charts. It was ''Sounds'' Single of the Week. After two weeks, ''Hypnotized'' reached No.&nbsp;1 on the ''Melody Maker'' indie chart, and No.&nbsp;2 on the ''NME'' indie chart (second only to [[The Stone Roses]]' \"[[She Bangs The Drums]]\"). It was voted No.&nbsp;33 in [[John Peel]]'s end of year [[Festive Fifty]].{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=233\u2013234}}\n\nA third guitarist, [[Slipstream (band)|Mark Refoy]], had been recruited at the beginning of Summer 1989, to play on later live dates and work on the next album. Refoy had been a friend and keen fan of the band for several years, and had contributed to Kember's solo album. He was guitarist in the indie band 'The Tell-tale Hearts' who had disbanded in 1987. Refoy made his first live performance with Spacemen 3 at their Rugby 'homecoming' gig on 20 July.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=230, 235}}\n\nOn 23 July, Spacemen 3 played their biggest headlining gig at [[The Town & Country Club]], London, a 2,000-capacity venue. On 22 August, they played a warm-up gig at Subterranea, London, for the Reading Festival, their first festival gig. Spacemen 3 played at the [[Reading Festival]] on 25 August 1989. This would transpire to be their last ever live performance.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=235\u2013236, 238\u2013239}}\n\nAt the beginning of September 1989, Spacemen 3 were about to undertake a substantial tour of the United States \u2013 despite disagreement between Kember and Pierce as to whether Kate Radley could accompany them. The tour schedule had been finalised and they were due to be in America for the rest of the year, playing about 50 gigs.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=234,241\u2013242}} The band had grievances with their manager Gerald Palmer, such as perceived lack of monies being received, and summoned him to a meeting at VHF Studios. The meeting, which was secretly recorded, involved intense arguments and accusations, and nothing was resolved.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=242\u2013244}} In an interview in 1991, Kember described Palmer as \"the most devious guy I've ever had the misfortune to meet\".<ref name=\"Vox-april1991\">''Vox'', April 1991</ref>\n\nA few days later Kember and Pierce met Palmer again and sacked him. However, Palmer's partnership agreement with Kember and Pierce meant that he was contractually still effectively one third of Spacemen 3. Palmer had already incurred at least \u00a310,000 in recording expenses for the next album. In response to his dismissal as manager, he decided to withdraw his commitment to finance the imminent US tour, which was therefore cancelled at the eleventh hour. Tour posters had already been printed. The considerable time and money Bomp! Records' Greg Shaw had expended in preparing the tour was wasted.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=234,241\u2013245}}\n\nThe official explanation at the time \u2013 and that reported in the UK music press \u2013 was that the US tour had been cancelled because they had not been able to obtain work permits due to the drug convictions of band members. However, it has since transpired that this was not the case: work permits had been obtained for the band, albeit with difficulty.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=241, 244\u2013245}}\n\nRecording for Spacemen 3's fourth studio album, ''[[Recurring (album)|Recurring]]'', had commenced at the beginning of August 1989, again at VHF Studios. According to Mark Refoy, Kember and Pierce rarely appeared at the studio at the same time and there was \"quite a tense atmosphere\" between them. When work recommenced after the Reading Festival, Kember and Pierce were recording separately from one another. Pierce contributed guitar parts to Kember's songs, but Kember did not play on any of Pierce's songs. When Kember heard Pierce's demos, he again renewed his claim that he was copying his sounds and effects, and accused Pierce's \"Billy Whizz\" of being a composition he had written several years prior. The two were now estranged and working completely separately. They agreed to have separate sides of the album for their own songs, all of which they had written and composed individually. Pierce's side of the album is effectively his next project 'Spiritualized', and Kember's side of effectively his next project 'Spectrum' with Richard Formby Kember's partner in Spectrum playing guitar on his side.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Spacemen-3-Recurring/release/541723|title=Spacemen 3 - Recurring|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Spectrum-Soul-Kiss-Glide-Divine/master/32822|title=Spectrum (4) - Soul Kiss (Glide Divine)|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=9 November 2019}}</ref> The other three band members \u2013 Carruthers, Mattock and Refoy \u2013 who all went onto join Spiritualized, were called in to contribute sessions when required.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=237, 241\u2013242, 246\u2013250}}\n\nIn late September, Kember made a solo performance at a gig supporting [[The Telescopes]]. Kember and Pierce agreed to be in the studio together to record a cover of [[Mudhoney]]'s \"When Tomorrow Hits\", for a prospective split single with Mudhoney. When Kember heard Mudhoney's version of \"Revolution\", with altered lyrics, he was offended and this collaborative [[Sub Pop]] release was called off however. The recording of \"When Tomorrow Hits\" was the last occasion Kember and Pierce would work together. A disconsolate Will Carruthers left the band at this point, fed up with the discord and lack of remuneration.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=252\u2013254}}\n\nRecording for the album proceeded slowly and was still ongoing in Autumn 1989, by which point Kember had used two to three times the amount of studio time as Pierce. According to band members, Kember's behaviour was becoming increasingly obsessive and erratic. He was regularly missing booked studio slots.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=241, 247\u2013252}} In late October, Kember's debut solo single, \"Angel\" was released. It received a lukewarm reception.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=254}}\n\nOn 14 November 1989, the four remaining Spacemen 3 band members met to discuss finishing the album and arranging future live dates. The meeting was unproductive. Reportedly, Kember and Pierce both said little. Jonny Mattock told Kember he was difficult to work with. Mattock and Mark Refoy, both peeved, left the meeting prematurely and effectively resigned from Spacemen 3. In December, Gerald Palmer attempted to mediate between his business partners, Kember and Pierce, meeting them individually because Pierce reportedly refused contact with Kember.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=258\u2013260}}\n\n====Dedicated record deal====\n\nDuring 1989, Gerald Palmer had been courting interest and offers from US major record labels. Palmer had been postponing a decision hoping the US tour would lever improved offers. Negotiations with [[Dedicated Records]], a satellite label of [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]], had been ongoing for several months. The poor intra-band relations had remained secret for the sake of outward appearance. By October 1989, the latest offer from Dedicated was a five-album, multimillion-dollar deal, with a \u00a360,000 advance. Palmer had expended \u00a315,000 on legal fees, and because he had managed to negotiate out the standard [[Leaving Member Clause]], Kember and Pierce were in a '[[win-win situation]]'.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=234\u2013235, 240\u2013241, 246, 261\u2013262}}\n\nIn December, the three met to arrange signing the Dedicated record deal. Pierce insisted that Kember sign an agreement stating that the two of them had equal rights to Spacemen 3, to mutually protect them by preventing either party potentially claiming ownership of the Spacemen 3 name should the other quit. Coerced by the attraction of his portion of the Dedicated advance, Kember signed it. Mattock claims Kember attacked Pierce in the street the next morning. At the beginning of 1990, Kember and Pierce attended the London offices of Dedicated separately to sign the record contract. A few days later, at a dinner (at the Paper Tiger Chinese restaurant in Lutterworth, Leicestershire) with Dedicated executives, Kember and Pierce were cordial with the other guests but didn't talk with one another. The pretence was kept up until the end; Palmer did not inform Dedicated about the band breaking up until March.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=261\u2013264, 268\u2013269}}\n\n====1990====\nIn late 1989, Jason Pierce, dissatisfied with his mixes at VHF Studios, took his recordings for the ''Recurring'' album to Battery Studios, London. Assisted by engineer/producer [[Anjali Dutt]], Pierce completed final [[remixes]] of his songs in January 1990. However, Peter Kember's side of the album was far from ready, and he resorted to calling on the help of [[Richard Formby]], a producer. According to Formby, when he arrived, Kember's recording was only half done; some songs were incomplete, and two had to be re-recorded from scratch.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=254\u2013255, 265\u2013267}}\n\nIn January 1990, Kember's side project and debut solo album, ''Spectrum'' (Sonic Boom), was released. Recorded nearly a year previously, Kember had used the project as a vehicle for a group of melancholic themed songs, having decided to save his more upbeat work for Spacemen 3 and ''Recurring''.<ref name=\"Sniffin\"/><ref>Peter Kember \u2013 TV interview, 1991</ref> The ''Spectrum'' album was advertised as being by the \"founder member/leader of Spacemen 3\".{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=266}}\n\nAlso in January, Pierce was developing ideas for forming a new band or side project of his own. He invited Spacemen 3 compatriots, Refoy, Carruthers and Mattock, to jam and rehearse with him at a small church hall and his flat. Initially it was informal, but this was the origin of Pierce's Spacemen 3 'splinter' band, [[Spiritualized]], comprising all the same members as Spacemen 3 except for Kember. In February 1990, this new grouping recorded \"Anyway That You Want Me\". This was recorded at VHF Studios; the purpose of these sessions was kept secret from Kember who was still working there.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=264\u2013268}} Speaking in 1991, Pierce explained the purpose of starting Spiritualized:\n\n{{cquote|It was so as though I could get back on the road again. Pete [Kember] was still doing tracks for ''Recurring'', and it was a long way off Spacemen 3 touring again, so I wanted to do another tour. So, initially, it [Spiritualized] was set up as a means to get back on the road.<ref>Jason Pierce \u2013 TV interview, c. Spring 1991.</ref>}}\n\nKember continued on completing his ''Recurring'' material. His indecision and constant remixing was prolonging the recording of the album. Gerald Palmer was still funding the studio time, and warned Kember to finish. Eventually, intolerant of any more delays, Palmer attended VHF Studios. He seized Kember's tapes, carrying out a previous threat, and chose the final mixes for release. There were reportedly dozens of different mixes for each song.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=267\u2013268}}\n\nIn June 1990, Spiritualized released their debut single, \"Anyway That You Want Me\". This was a cover of a song by The Troggs which Spacemen 3 had demoed in 1988 during their ''Playing With Fire'' sessions. The single's cover sleeve, which had no text on it, controversially bore a sticker saying \"Spacemen 3\". Furthermore, adverts for the single featured the Spacemen 3 logo.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=264\u2013270}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/>\n\nThe release of the Spiritualized single was the first Kember had definite knowledge of the band's existence. The circumstances surrounding the single and its marketing prompted Kember to announce that he was leaving Spacemen 3 and that the band no longer existed.<ref name=\"Vox-april1991\"/> {{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=264\u2013269}}<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> Kember, interviewed in 1991:\n\n{{cquote|I was pretty peeved because the whole thing was done in total secrecy, and everyone involved was told not to tell me about it, which is quite different from my solo project which was all done totally in the open.<ref name=\"Vox-april1991\"/> }}\n\nIn the latter half of 1990, Pierce's new band, [[Spiritualized]], toured around the UK. They performed songs from the then as yet unreleased ''Recurring'', as well as new material. Spiritualized signed a record deal with Dedicated and recorded their debut album in Winter 1990/91.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=269\u2013271}}\n\n====1991====\nIn January 1991, the Spacemen 3 single \"Big City\"/\"Drive\" was released. Both songs from the double A-side single were from the soon-to-released ''Recurring''. Kember and Pierce had been due to be at the studio for the mastering of the single, however Pierce did not attend. At that point the two had hardly spoken face to face in over six months. Kember decided to fade out several minutes of Pierce's song from the single, \"Drive\".{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=272}}\n\nThe last Spacemen 3 album, ''[[Recurring (album)|Recurring]]'', was finally released in February 1991. Although the band had not officially disbanded, for all intents and purposes it was a posthumous release. The two sides of the album \u2013 one by Kember (A-side), the other by Pierce (B-side) \u2013 reflected the split between the band's two main personnel.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=272\u2013273}}\n\nThe songs on ''Recurring'' had been composed in 1989. It expanded on the sounds of the previous, ''Playing With Fire'' album. Musically, it was richer and lusher, but Kember and Pierce's respective halves of ''Recurring'' were distinctly different and presaged the solo material which they were already working on by the time of the album's release. Kember's side demonstrated his pop and ambient sensibilities; Pierce's side indicated his sympathy for gospel and blues music and his interest in lush production.{{sfn|Morse|2004|pp=214\u2013216, 237, 246\u2013247, 272\u2013273}}\n\n{{quote|Pierce's sound is more lyrical and dramatic, building songs into climaxes.

The release of ''Recurring'' prompted renewed press speculation about the future of Spacemen 3. No official statement explained why, or confirmed whether, Spacemen 3 had broken up. The fall-out was covered in the music press:\n\n{{quote|One of the main reasons the band split was because I felt Jason was aping everything I was doing.

This minimalist musical approach typically represented compositions consisting of the repetition of simple riffs based around the progression of only two or three [[chord (music)|chords]], or simply using just one chord.

Kember candidly admitted to his frequent drug taking \u2013 including [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[LSD]], [[magic mushrooms]], [[MDMA]], [[amphetamine]] and [[cocaine]] \u2013 and being a former [[heroin]] addict.

\"Suicide\" was a clear acknowledgement of one of their influences: when performed live it was usually introduced as \"this song is dedicated to [[Martin Rev]] and [[Alan Vega]] \u2013 [[Suicide

This material includes: live recordings; demos; earlier iterations of certain songs; alternate versions of many songs; some unfinished work; and some entirely previously unreleased songs. These releases have been both official and unofficial, and some have been issued by the Kember/Palmer-affiliated label [[Space Age Recordings]].\n\n''Losing Touch with Your Mind'', an unofficial release of 1991, was a compilation of alternate song versions and rare releases. The 1993 re-release of [[Dreamweapon: An Evening of Contemporary Sitar Music|''Dreamweapon'']] on the Sympathy For The Record Industry label \u2013 which included the intriguing live 44-minute Eastern-inspired [[drone music]] performance at the Watermans Art Centre, Brentford, London, of August 1988 \u2013 was augmented with a previously unreleased recording of a jam.<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\n1995 saw the unofficial release of the band's first demo tape: ''For All the Fucked Up Children of This World We Give You Spacemen 3''. Dating to 1984, this provided an interesting insight into the band's earliest work and \"rougher\" sound. These recordings pre-dated the other early demos previously made available on the 1990 unofficial, Father Yod release entitled ''Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To''.\n\nThe 1994 re-release of the ''Taking Drugs to Make Music to Take Drugs To'' (Northampton Demos) album included several previously unreleased alternate song versions and other bonus tracks.\n\nTwo live albums were released in 1995: ''Live In Europe 1989'' (also released in 1995 as ''Spacemen Are Go!'' on the Bomp! label, but without 'Take Me to the Other Side' and an alternate take of 'Suicide') which represented the first release of the band's live work from their lengthy 1989 contintental tour; and ''Revolution or Heroin'', a bootleg of performances from the band's 1988 gig at the University of London Students Union. The former has been described as \"far better than the more ragged earlier Spacemen 3 live album, 1988's ''Performance''\" (Stewart Mason, ''AllMusic'').<ref name=\"amg\"/>\n\nIn 1999, Spacemen 3's third studio album, [[Playing with Fire (Spacemen 3 album)|''Playing with Fire'']], was given a special, 10th-anniversary re-release. This official double disc release comprised all the original recordings together with previously unreleased alternate versions, demos and covers (e.g. The Perfect Disaster's \"Girl on Fire\" and The Troggs' \"Anyway That You Want Me\") from the same studio sessions. This re-release has been described as the \"definitive\"<ref name=\"Record Collector\"/> version of the [[Playing with Fire (Spacemen 3 album)|''Playing with Fire'']] album.\n\nIn 2004, Spacemen 3's second studio album, ''[[The Perfect Prescription]]'', was also given the special re-release treatment. The double disc official release, entitled ''[[Forged Prescriptions]]'', comprised alternate mixes of the original album tracks together with previously unreleased alternate versions, demos and covers (e.g. The Spades' \"We Sell Soul\" and The Troggs' \"I Want You\") from the same studio sessions. Kember's liner notes explain that the alternative mixes represent the more multi-layered versions which he and Pierce agreed not to use because they would be unable to satisfactorily reproduce their sound live.\n\nA [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] called the ''Out of it Sessions'' comprises demo recordings of early iterations of songs from ''[[The Perfect Prescription]]'' album.\n\nIn 2005, Kember produced and released his own limited edition, double disc album, ''How the Blues Should've Turned Out''. This wholly comprised previously unreleased material, including alternate versions, rough demos, unfinished work, etc.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Spiritualized]]\n*[[Peter Kember|Sonic Boom]]\n*[[Peter Kember#Spectrum|Spectrum]]\n*[[Peter Kember#E.A.R.|E.A.R.]]\n*[[The Darkside|Darkside]]\n*[[Slipstream (band)|Slipstream]]\n\n==Further reading==\n'''Biographies:'''\n* Morse, Erik (2005).

Trains and highways are the central pieces of the system.\n\n==Transit systems==\n[[File:Metro-North train 1567 enters Stamford.jpg|250px|right|thumb|A [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[New Haven Line]] train at [[Stamford Transportation Center|Stamford]].]]\n\n===Rail===\nSouthwestern Connecticut is served by MTA's [[Metro-North Railroad]] [[New Haven Line]], providing commuter service to New York City and New Haven, with branches servicing [[New Canaan Branch|New Canaan]], [[Danbury Branch|Danbury]], and [[Waterbury Branch|Waterbury]]. Connecticut lies along [[Amtrak]]'s [[Northeast Corridor]] which features frequent [[Northeast Regional]] and [[Acela Express]] service. Towns between New Haven and New London are also served by the [[Shore Line East]] commuter line. Operation of commuter trains from New Haven to Springfield on Amtrak's [[New Haven-Springfield Line]] is under consideration.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhhsrail.com/ |title=NHHS Rail |publisher=NHHS Rail |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=September 15, 2011}}</ref> Amtrak also operates a shuttle service between New Haven and [[Springfield, Massachusetts]], servicing Hartford and other towns on the corridor.\n\n===Bus===\nStatewide [[bus]] service is supplied by [[Connecticut Transit]], owned by the [[Connecticut Department of Transportation]], with smaller municipal authorities providing local service. Bus networks are an important part of the transportation system in Connecticut, especially in urban areas like Hartford, Stamford, Norwalk, Bridgeport and New Haven. The state also operates [[CTfastrak]], a [[bus rapid transit]] line linking [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] and Hartford.<ref name=march28>{{cite press release |url=http://ctfastrak.com/about/news/news-releases/13-media-releases/279-03-28-15-despite-snow-thousands-of-riders-many-first-timers-experience-ctfastrak-on-first-day-of-service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911222239/http://ctfastrak.com/about/news/news-releases/13-media-releases/279-03-28-15-despite-snow-thousands-of-riders-many-first-timers-experience-ctfastrak-on-first-day-of-service |archivedate=11 September 2015 |title=Despite Snow, Thousands of Riders, Many First-Timers, Experience CTfastrak on First Day of Service |publisher=Connecticut Department of Transportation |date=28 March 2015}}</ref><ref name=CTfastrak>{{cite web|title=What Is CTfastrak|url=http://www.ctfastrak.com/about/what-is-ctfastrak|publisher=State of Connecticut|accessdate=18 October 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=LaPorte|first1=Mike|title=The Busway to the Future: Insider to CTfastrak before Opening to Public|url=http://livewiremcc.org/2014/11/05/the-busway-to-the-future-insider-to-ctfastrak-before-opening-to-public/|accessdate=11 December 2014|work=The Live Wire|agency=Manchester Community College|date=5 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Roads and freeways==\n{{main|List of state routes in Connecticut}}\n[[File:Map of Connecticut NA cropped.png|300px|right|thumb|Map of Connecticut showing major highways.]]\nThe [[Interstate highway]]s in the state are [[Interstate 95 in Connecticut|I-95]] (the majority of the [[Connecticut Turnpike]]) traveling southwest to northeast along the coast, [[Interstate 84 in Connecticut|I-84]] traveling southwest to northeast in the center of the state, [[Interstate 91 in Connecticut|I-91]] traveling south to north in the center of the state, and [[Interstate 395 in Connecticut|I-395]] (the rest of the Connecticut Turnpike) traveling south to north near the eastern edge of the state. The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Connecticut Route 15|Route&nbsp;15]], traveling from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York State]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]]. Route&nbsp;15 and I-95 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of terrible crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.<ref>[http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ Connecticut Turnpike (I-95)] nycroads.com</ref> Other major arteries in the state include [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 7]] (US&nbsp;7) in the west traveling parallel to the NY state line, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route&nbsp;8]] farther east near the industrial city of [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] and traveling south to north along the [[Naugatuck River Valley]] nearly parallel with US&nbsp;7, and [[Connecticut Route 9|Route&nbsp;9]] in the east.\n\nBetween New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Many people now drive longer distances to work in the New York City area. This strains the three lanes of traffic capacity, resulting in lengthy [[rush hour]] delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and [[ride-sharing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrides.com/ |title=ctrides.com |publisher=ctrides.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycling ownership and use in the United States.

The other major highways in Connecticut are the [[Merritt Parkway]] and [[Wilbur Cross Parkway]], which together form [[Connecticut Route 15|Route&nbsp;15]], traveling from the [[Hutchinson River Parkway]] in [[New York State]] parallel to I-95 before turning north of [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] and traveling parallel to I-91, finally becoming a surface road in [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]]. Route&nbsp;15 and I-95 were originally [[toll road]]s; they relied on a system of [[toll plaza]]s at which all traffic stopped and paid fixed tolls. A series of terrible crashes at these plazas eventually contributed to the decision to remove the tolls in 1988.<ref>[http://www.nycroads.com/roads/ct-turnpike/ Connecticut Turnpike (I-95)] nycroads.com</ref> Other major arteries in the state include [[U.S. Route 7 in Connecticut|U.S. Route 7]] (US&nbsp;7) in the west traveling parallel to the NY state line, [[Connecticut Route 8|Route&nbsp;8]] farther east near the industrial city of [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]] and traveling south to north along the [[Naugatuck River Valley]] nearly parallel with US&nbsp;7, and [[Connecticut Route 9|Route&nbsp;9]] in the east.\n\nBetween New Haven and New York City, I-95 is one of the most congested highways in the United States. Many people now drive longer distances to work in the New York City area. This strains the three lanes of traffic capacity, resulting in lengthy [[rush hour]] delays. Frequently, the congestion spills over to clog the parallel Merritt Parkway. The state has encouraged traffic reduction schemes, including rail use and [[ride-sharing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctrides.com/ |title=ctrides.com |publisher=ctrides.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}</ref>\n\nConnecticut also has a very active bicycling community, with one of the highest rates of bicycling ownership and use in the United States.

A member of the group since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with the band as well as one solo record. As a guitarist, the Edge has crafted a minimalistic and [[texture (music)|textural]] style of playing.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} His use of a rhythmic [[delay (audio effect)|delay]] effect yields a distinctive sound that has become a signature of U2's music.\n\nThe Edge was born in England to a Welsh family, and was raised in Ireland after the Evans family moved there. In 1976, at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] he formed a band with his fellow students and elder brother [[Dik Evans|Dik]] that would evolve into U2. Inspired by the ethos of [[punk rock]] and its basic arrangements, the group began to write its own material. They eventually became one of the most successful acts in [[popular music]], with albums such as 1987's ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and 1991's ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. Over the years, the Edge has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his own style, including [[American roots music]], [[industrial music]], and [[alternative rock]]. With U2, the Edge has also played keyboards, co-produced their 1993 record ''[[Zooropa]]'', and occasionally served as co-lyricist. The Edge met his second wife [[Morleigh Steinberg]] through her collaborations with the band.\n\nAs a member of U2 and as an individual, the Edge has campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes. He co-founded [[Music Rising]], a charity to support musicians affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate [[Bono]] on several projects, including songs for [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Tina Turner]], and the soundtracks to the musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s London stage adaptation of ''[[A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music|A Clockwork Orange]]''. As a member of U2, the Edge has won 22 [[Grammy Award]]s and has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Several music publications have ranked the Edge among the greatest guitarists of all time.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Howell Evans was born at the [[Barking, London|Barking]] Maternity Hospital,<ref>Dunphy (1988), p. 70</ref> in the county of [[Essex]] in [[England]], on 8 August 1961. He is the second child of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] parents Garvin and Gwenda Evans,<ref name=\"m21\" /> both of whom originated from [[Llanelli]], a coastal town in [[South Wales]]. Garvin was an engineer who worked for the local electricity board, and subsequently worked for the electronics company [[Plessey]].<ref name=\"m21\" />  The Edge has an elder brother [[Dik Evans|Richard]] (often called Dik) and a younger sister called Gillian.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nThe Evanses initially lived in [[Chadwell Heath]], Essex. Around 1962, Garvin was offered a promotion and a transfer at his job, and the family subsequently moved to [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for him to take it.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nDuring his childhood in Dublin he possessed two differing [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s to converse in, [[Welsh English|Welsh]] and [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]], the former being used when he was in the family home and the latter when he was outside; as he later explained: \"The reason for this dual identity was mainly to be understood by my peers but also to be accepted.\"<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nHe received his initial formal education at St. Andrew's National School, in Malahide.

The nickname is commonly believed to be derived from the angular shape of Evans' head.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 68</ref><ref>McGee (2008), p. 9</ref> However, the origin of the name is disputed and other theories include a description of his guitar playing and his preference for not becoming fully involved and therefore remaining on the edge of things.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.threechordsandthetruth.net/u2bios/u2edgebio.php|title=Biography of U2's guitarist, The Edge|website=www.threechordsandthetruth.net|access-date=2018-03-24}}</ref>\n\nU2 began its public performance life in small venues in Dublin in 1977, occasionally playing at other venues elsewhere in Ireland.

They have power. I think of notes as being expensive. You don't just throw them around. I find the ones that do the best job and that's what I use. I suppose I'm a minimalist instinctively. I don't like to be inefficient if I can get away with it. Like on the end of '[[With or Without You]]'. My instinct was to go with something very simple. Everyone else said, \"Nah, you can't do that.\" I won the argument and I still think it's sort of brave, because the end of 'With or Without You' could have been so much bigger, so much more of a climax, but there's this power to it which I think is even more potent because it's held back... ultimately I'm interested in music. I'm a musician. I'm not a gunslinger. That's the difference between what I do and what a lot of ''guitar heroes'' do.\"\n | source = \u2014The Edge in 1991<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 43</ref>\n | width  = 27%\n | align  = right\n | style = padding:8px;\n}}\n\n=== Guitar playing ===\nAs a guitar player, The Edge has a sound typified by a low-key playing style, a chiming, shimmering sound (thanks in part to the sound of [[Vox AC30]]s) that he achieves with extensive use of [[Delay (audio effect)|delay effects]] and [[reverberation|reverb]]. The repeat delay is often set to a [[Dotted note|dotted]] eighth note, and the feedback gain is adjusted until a note played repeats two or three times.<ref name=\"edge delay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesta.net/edge_delay/|title=Edge Delay|publisher=Amnesta.net|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987's ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', The Edge often contributes just a few simple lead lines given depth and richness by an ever-present delay. For example, the introduction to \"[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]\" is simply a repeated six-note [[arpeggio]], broadened by a modulated delay effect. The Edge has said that he views musical notes as \"expensive\", in that he prefers to play as few notes as possible. He said in 1982 of his style,\n\n{{quote|I like a nice ringing sound on guitar, and most of my chords I find two strings and make them ring the same note, so it's almost like a 12-string sound. So for E I might play a B, E, E and B and make it ring. It works very well with the [[Gibson Explorer]]. It's funny because the bass end of the Explorer was so awful that I used to stay away from the low strings, and a lot of the chords I played were very trebly, on the first four, or even three strings. I discovered that through using this one area of the fretboard I was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way.<ref name=success />}}\n\nHis first guitar was an old acoustic guitar that his mother bought him at a local flea market for a few pounds; he was nine at the time. He and his brother [[Dik Evans]] both experimented with this instrument.<ref name=success>{{cite web |url=http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id16.html |title=On the Edge of Success |publisher=U2 Magazine |number=3 |date=1 May 1982 |accessdate=6 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724224912/http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id16.html |archivedate=24 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He said in 1982 of this early experimentation, \"I suppose the first link in the chain was a visit to the local [[jumble sale]] where I purchased a guitar for a [[pound sterling|pound]]. That was my first instrument. It was an acoustic guitar and me and my elder brother Dik both played it, plonking away, all very rudimentary stuff, open chords and all that.\"<ref name=success /> The Edge has stated that many of his guitar parts are based around guitar effects. This is especially true from the ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' era onwards, although much of the band's 1980s material made heavy use of echos.\n\n=== Vocals ===\n[[File:The Edge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Edge in June 2005]]\nThe Edge also supplies the backing vocals for U2. U2's 1983 live album and video release, ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' and ''[[Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' are good reference points for his singing (as are the live DVDs from the Elevation Tour, ''[[U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle]]'' and ''[[Elevation 2001: Live from Boston]]''). For example, he sings the chorus to \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\" (Bono harmonises on the final 'Sunday'). U2 used this tradeoff technique later in \"[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]\" as well. His backing vocals are sometimes in the form of a repeated cry; examples of songs that use this approach include \"[[Beautiful Day (song)|Beautiful Day]]\", \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\" and \"[[Stay (Faraway, So Close!)]]\". Another technique he uses in his backing vocals is the falsetto, in songs such as \"[[Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of]]\", \"[[Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own]]\", \"A Man and a Woman\", \"The Wanderer\", live versions of \"[[The Fly (song)|The Fly]]\", and \"[[Window in the Skies]]\".\n\nThe Edge sings the lead vocal on \"[[Van Diemen's Land (song)|Van Diemen's Land]]\" and \"[[Numb (U2 song)|Numb]]\", the first half of the song \"Seconds\", dual vocals with Bono in \"Discotheque\", and the bridge in the song \"[[Miracle Drug]]\".<ref name=\"edge-bio\"/> He also sings the occasional lead vocal in live renditions of other songs (such as \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" during the [[PopMart Tour]] and \"Party Girl\" during the Rotterdam Zoo TV show when it was Bono's birthday),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2-vertigo-tour.com/show355.html |title=U2 Rotterdam, 10 May 1993 at Feyenoord Stadion, ZOO TV Tour \u2013 U1}}</ref> and has sung the second verse of the \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\" cover on a few shows. A solo acoustic version of the song \"[[Love is Blindness]]\", that is featured in the documentary film ''[[From the Sky Down]]'', is sung by him as well.\n\n=== Other instruments ===\nHe has played keyboards on many of the band's songs, including \"I Fall Down\", \"[[October (song)|October]]\", \"[[So Cruel]]\", \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\", \"[[Running to Stand Still]]\", \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\", \"The Hands that Built America\", and \"[[Original of the Species]]\" and others. In live versions of \"New Year's Day\", \"[[The Unforgettable Fire (song)|The Unforgettable Fire]]\", \"[[Your Blue Room]]\", \"[[Moment of Surrender]]\" and \"Raised By Wolves\", he plays both the piano and guitar parts alternately. In most live versions of \"Original of the Species,\" piano is the only instrument played during the song. Although The Edge is the band's lead guitarist, he occasionally plays bass guitar, including the live performances of the song [[40 (song)|\"40\"]] where The Edge and bassist [[Adam Clayton]] switch instruments.\n\n==Other musical pursuits==\n[[File:The Edge 360 Tour Foxboro 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|The Edge performing in 2009]]\nIn addition to his regular role within U2, The Edge has also recorded with such artists as [[Johnny Cash]], [[B. B. King]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Jah Wobble]], [[Holger Czukay]], [[Jay-Z]], and [[Rihanna]]. The Edge connected with [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] collaborator [[Michael Brook]] (the creator of the [[infinite guitar]], which he regularly uses), working with him on the [[Captive (soundtrack)|score to the film ''Captive'']] (1986). From this soundtrack the song \"Heroine\", the vocal of which was sung by a young [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] was released as a single.\n\nHe also created the theme song for season one and two of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. He and fellow U2 member Bono wrote the theme of the 1995 [[James Bond]] film ''[[GoldenEye]]''. The Edge, along with Bono, composed a [[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark|musical adaptation]] of [[Spider-Man]]. On 25 May 2011, a single titled \"[[Rise Above 1]]\" by Reeve Carney featuring Bono and The Edge was released digitally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/rise-above-1-20110526|title=Rise Above 1 by Reeve Carney feat.

The film premiered on 5 September 2008 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]\n\nOn 29 April 2016, the Edge performed in the [[Sistine Chapel]] as part of a conference for the Angiogenesis Foundation, making him the first rock artist to stage a concert at the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/the-edge-becomes-first-rock-star-to-play-the-sistine-chapel-a7011056.html|title=The Edge becomes first rock star to play the Sistine Chapel|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Jess|last=Denham|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[Image:EdgeAC30.jpg|thumb|Edge's 1964 [[Vox AC30]] on stage in [[Foxborough]] for the [[U2 360\u00b0 Tour]].]]\nThe Edge plays electric guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards, piano, bass guitar (on \"40\" and \"Race Against Time\") and [[lap steel guitar]].

Key to his signature sound are the use of modulated delays, namely a Korg SDD-3000 delay unit made in the early 80's, as well as a special Herdim guitar pick, which Edge holds upside down to expose the \"dimples\" when hitting the guitar strings to achieve a raspier chime.<ref>http://www.amnesta.net/edge_delay/herdim.html</ref> For his main amplification, The Edge uses a vintage Vox AC30 particularly a 1964 JMI-era \"Top Boost\" model chassis fitted into an early 70's cabinet.<ref name=\"musicradar.com\"/>  In 2016, [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] unveiled a signature guitar model, The Edge Signature Stratocaster, which The Edge has been using on the most recent tours to replace his vintage 70's Stratocasters.<ref>http://www.guitarworld.com/gear/edge-discusses-his-new-signature-fender-strat</ref> Around the same time Fender also unveiled a signature amp, the Fender Edge Deluxe.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:The Edge with Steve Censky and Dr William W Li at USDA HQ 6-19-2018.jpeg|thumb|The Edge with [[United States Deputy Secretary of Agriculture|US Deputy Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Stephen Censky]] and Angiogenesis Foundation co-founder Dr. William W.

Irish musician and songwriter best known as the lead guitarist, keyboardist and backing vocalist of the [[rock music|rock]] band [[U2]]. A member of the group since its inception, he has recorded 14 studio albums with the band as well as one solo record. As a guitarist, the Edge has crafted a minimalistic and [[texture (music)|textural]] style of playing.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}} His use of a rhythmic [[delay (audio effect)|delay]] effect yields a distinctive sound that has become a signature of U2's music.\n\nThe Edge was born in England to a Welsh family, and was raised in Ireland after the Evans family moved there. In 1976, at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] he formed a band with his fellow students and elder brother [[Dik Evans|Dik]] that would evolve into U2. Inspired by the ethos of [[punk rock]] and its basic arrangements, the group began to write its own material. They eventually became one of the most successful acts in [[popular music]], with albums such as 1987's ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'' and 1991's ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. Over the years, the Edge has experimented with various guitar effects and introduced influences from several genres of music into his own style, including [[American roots music]], [[industrial music]], and [[alternative rock]]. With U2, the Edge has also played keyboards, co-produced their 1993 record ''[[Zooropa]]'', and occasionally served as co-lyricist. The Edge met his second wife [[Morleigh Steinberg]] through her collaborations with the band.\n\nAs a member of U2 and as an individual, the Edge has campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes. He co-founded [[Music Rising]], a charity to support musicians affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]]. He has collaborated with U2 bandmate [[Bono]] on several projects, including songs for [[Roy Orbison]] and [[Tina Turner]], and the soundtracks to the musical ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'' and the [[Royal Shakespeare Company]]'s London stage adaptation of ''[[A Clockwork Orange: A Play with Music|A Clockwork Orange]]''. As a member of U2, the Edge has won 22 [[Grammy Award]]s and has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]. Several music publications have ranked the Edge among the greatest guitarists of all time.\n\n==Early life==\nDavid Howell Evans was born at the [[Barking, London|Barking]] Maternity Hospital,<ref>Dunphy (1988), p. 70</ref> in the county of [[Essex]] in [[England]], on 8 August 1961. He is the second child of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] parents Garvin and Gwenda Evans,<ref name=\"m21\" /> both of whom originated from [[Llanelli]], a coastal town in [[South Wales]]. Garvin was an engineer who worked for the local electricity board, and subsequently worked for the electronics company [[Plessey]].<ref name=\"m21\" />  The Edge has an elder brother [[Dik Evans|Richard]] (often called Dik) and a younger sister called Gillian.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nThe Evanses initially lived in [[Chadwell Heath]], Essex. Around 1962, Garvin was offered a promotion and a transfer at his job, and the family subsequently moved to [[County Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for him to take it.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nDuring his childhood in Dublin he possessed two differing [[accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]]s to converse in, [[Welsh English|Welsh]] and [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]], the former being used when he was in the family home and the latter when he was outside; as he later explained: \"The reason for this dual identity was mainly to be understood by my peers but also to be accepted.\"<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\nHe received his initial formal education at St. Andrew's National School, in Malahide. As a child, he also received piano and guitar lessons, and practised music with his brother Richard.<ref name=\"m21\" />\n\n==U2==\n{{Main|U2}}\n[[File:The Edge in Belfast, Nov 19 2015.jpg|thumb|The Edge performing at a [[U2]] concert in Belfast in 2015]]\nWhilst the Evans brothers were at [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] in Dublin in 1976, they went along to a meeting in response to an advert posted by another pupil, [[Larry Mullen Jr.]], on the school's noticeboard seeking musicians to form a new band with him. Among the several other pupils who also responded to the note were [[Paul Hewson]] and [[Adam Clayton]].<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 27\u201330</ref> The band went through a number of reformations before becoming known as [[U2]] in March 1978 (Richard Evans having left before this to join another band, leaving his younger brother as the lead guitarist).<ref>McCormick (2006), pp. 46\u201348</ref>\n\nEarly in the band's career, Evans was given the nickname \"The Edge\" by members of the Lypton Village surrealist street gang to which Bono belonged.

In December 1979 they performed their first concerts outside Ireland, in [[London]], and in 1980 began extensive touring across the [[British Isles]], developing a following. Their debut album ''[[Boy (album)|Boy]]'' was released in 1980.\n\nIn 1981, leading up to the [[October Tour]], Evans came very close to leaving U2 for religious reasons, but he decided to stay.<ref name=\"m117\">McCormick (2006), pp. 117\u2013120</ref> During this period he became involved with a group called Shalom Tigers, in which bandmates [[Bono]] and Larry Mullen Jr. were also involved.<ref name=\"edge-bio\">{{cite web |url=http://www.atu2.com/band/edge/ |title=The Edge biography (@U2) |accessdate=9 September 2007}}</ref> Shortly after deciding to remain with the band, he wrote a piece of music that later became \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\".<ref name=\"m117\" />\n\n==Personal life==\nEvans married his secondary school girlfriend Aislinn O'Sullivan on 12 July 1983.<ref>McCormick (2006), p. 144</ref> They have three daughters: Hollie (born in 1984), Arran (in 1985) and 'Blue Angel' (in 1989).<ref name=\"edge-bio\" /> The couple separated in 1990, but were unable to get legally divorced because of Irish laws regarding marriage [[annulment]] at the time; divorce was [[Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|legalised in 1995]], and the couple legally divided in 1996.<ref name=\"edge-bio\" /> Evans is a [[Protestantism|Protestant Christian]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=7 May 2016|url=https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/music/u2s-the-edge-being-protestant-in-an-ostensibly-catholic-country-it-felt-strange-34692060.html|title=U2's The Edge: 'Being Protestant in an ostensibly Catholic country... it felt strange'|work=[[Belfast Telegraph]]}}</ref>\n\nIn 1993, he began dating [[Morleigh Steinberg]], an American professional dancer and choreographer whom he had met whilst she was employed as a dancer during the band's [[Zoo TV Tour]]. They have a daughter, Sian (born 1997), and a son, Levi (born 25 October 1999). The couple were married in 2002.<ref name=\"edge-bio\" />\n\nEvans has been criticised for his efforts to build five luxury mansions on a 156-acre (63.13-hectare) plot of land in [[Malibu, California]].<ref name=\"u2-plans\">{{Cite news |date=18 June 2011\n|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/u2-stars-plans-push-malibu-over-the-edge-2299306.html |title=U2 star's plans push Malibu over the edge |work=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> The [[California Coastal Commission]] voted 8\u20134 against the plans.

They have power. I think of notes as being expensive. You don't just throw them around. I find the ones that do the best job and that's what I use. I suppose I'm a minimalist instinctively. I don't like to be inefficient if I can get away with it. Like on the end of '[[With or Without You]]'. My instinct was to go with something very simple. Everyone else said, \"Nah, you can't do that.\" I won the argument and I still think it's sort of brave, because the end of 'With or Without You' could have been so much bigger, so much more of a climax, but there's this power to it which I think is even more potent because it's held back... ultimately I'm interested in music. I'm a musician. I'm not a gunslinger. That's the difference between what I do and what a lot of ''guitar heroes'' do.\"\n | source = \u2014The Edge in 1991<ref>Flanagan (1996), p. 43</ref>\n | width  = 27%\n | align  = right\n | style = padding:8px;\n}}\n\n=== Guitar playing ===\nAs a guitar player, The Edge has a sound typified by a low-key playing style, a chiming, shimmering sound (thanks in part to the sound of [[Vox AC30]]s) that he achieves with extensive use of [[Delay (audio effect)|delay effects]] and [[reverberation|reverb]]. The repeat delay is often set to a [[Dotted note|dotted]] eighth note, and the feedback gain is adjusted until a note played repeats two or three times.<ref name=\"edge delay\">{{cite web|url=http://www.amnesta.net/edge_delay/|title=Edge Delay|publisher=Amnesta.net|accessdate=27 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn 1987's ''[[The Joshua Tree]]'', The Edge often contributes just a few simple lead lines given depth and richness by an ever-present delay. For example, the introduction to \"[[Where the Streets Have No Name]]\" is simply a repeated six-note [[arpeggio]], broadened by a modulated delay effect. The Edge has said that he views musical notes as \"expensive\", in that he prefers to play as few notes as possible. He said in 1982 of his style,\n\n{{quote|I like a nice ringing sound on guitar, and most of my chords I find two strings and make them ring the same note, so it's almost like a 12-string sound. So for E I might play a B, E, E and B and make it ring. It works very well with the [[Gibson Explorer]]. It's funny because the bass end of the Explorer was so awful that I used to stay away from the low strings, and a lot of the chords I played were very trebly, on the first four, or even three strings. I discovered that through using this one area of the fretboard I was developing a very stylized way of doing something that someone else would play in a normal way.<ref name=success />}}\n\nHis first guitar was an old acoustic guitar that his mother bought him at a local flea market for a few pounds; he was nine at the time. He and his brother [[Dik Evans]] both experimented with this instrument.<ref name=success>{{cite web |url=http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id16.html |title=On the Edge of Success |publisher=U2 Magazine |number=3 |date=1 May 1982 |accessdate=6 November 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724224912/http://u2_interviews.tripod.com/id16.html |archivedate=24 July 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He said in 1982 of this early experimentation, \"I suppose the first link in the chain was a visit to the local [[jumble sale]] where I purchased a guitar for a [[pound sterling|pound]]. That was my first instrument. It was an acoustic guitar and me and my elder brother Dik both played it, plonking away, all very rudimentary stuff, open chords and all that.\"<ref name=success /> The Edge has stated that many of his guitar parts are based around guitar effects. This is especially true from the ''[[Achtung Baby]]'' era onwards, although much of the band's 1980s material made heavy use of echos.\n\n=== Vocals ===\n[[File:The Edge.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Edge in June 2005]]\nThe Edge also supplies the backing vocals for U2. U2's 1983 live album and video release, ''[[Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' and ''[[Live at Red Rocks: Under a Blood Red Sky]]'' are good reference points for his singing (as are the live DVDs from the Elevation Tour, ''[[U2 Go Home: Live from Slane Castle]]'' and ''[[Elevation 2001: Live from Boston]]''). For example, he sings the chorus to \"[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]\" (Bono harmonises on the final 'Sunday'). U2 used this tradeoff technique later in \"[[Bullet the Blue Sky]]\" as well. His backing vocals are sometimes in the form of a repeated cry; examples of songs that use this approach include \"[[Beautiful Day (song)|Beautiful Day]]\", \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\" and \"[[Stay (Faraway, So Close!)]]\". Another technique he uses in his backing vocals is the falsetto, in songs such as \"[[Stuck in a Moment You Can't Get Out Of]]\", \"[[Sometimes You Can't Make It on Your Own]]\", \"A Man and a Woman\", \"The Wanderer\", live versions of \"[[The Fly (song)|The Fly]]\", and \"[[Window in the Skies]]\".\n\nThe Edge sings the lead vocal on \"[[Van Diemen's Land (song)|Van Diemen's Land]]\" and \"[[Numb (U2 song)|Numb]]\", the first half of the song \"Seconds\", dual vocals with Bono in \"Discotheque\", and the bridge in the song \"[[Miracle Drug]]\".<ref name=\"edge-bio\"/> He also sings the occasional lead vocal in live renditions of other songs (such as \"Sunday Bloody Sunday\" during the [[PopMart Tour]] and \"Party Girl\" during the Rotterdam Zoo TV show when it was Bono's birthday),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.u2-vertigo-tour.com/show355.html |title=U2 Rotterdam, 10 May 1993 at Feyenoord Stadion, ZOO TV Tour \u2013 U1}}</ref> and has sung the second verse of the \"[[Stand by Me (Ben E. King song)|Stand by Me]]\" cover on a few shows. A solo acoustic version of the song \"[[Love is Blindness]]\", that is featured in the documentary film ''[[From the Sky Down]]'', is sung by him as well.\n\n=== Other instruments ===\nHe has played keyboards on many of the band's songs, including \"I Fall Down\", \"[[October (song)|October]]\", \"[[So Cruel]]\", \"[[New Year's Day (U2 song)|New Year's Day]]\", \"[[Running to Stand Still]]\", \"[[Miss Sarajevo]]\", \"The Hands that Built America\", and \"[[Original of the Species]]\" and others. In live versions of \"New Year's Day\", \"[[The Unforgettable Fire (song)|The Unforgettable Fire]]\", \"[[Your Blue Room]]\", \"[[Moment of Surrender]]\" and \"Raised By Wolves\", he plays both the piano and guitar parts alternately. In most live versions of \"Original of the Species,\" piano is the only instrument played during the song. Although The Edge is the band's lead guitarist, he occasionally plays bass guitar, including the live performances of the song [[40 (song)|\"40\"]] where The Edge and bassist [[Adam Clayton]] switch instruments.\n\n==Other musical pursuits==\n[[File:The Edge 360 Tour Foxboro 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|The Edge performing in 2009]]\nIn addition to his regular role within U2, The Edge has also recorded with such artists as [[Johnny Cash]], [[B. B. King]], [[Tina Turner]], [[Ronnie Wood]], [[Jah Wobble]], [[Holger Czukay]], [[Jay-Z]], and [[Rihanna]]. The Edge connected with [[Brian Eno]] and [[Daniel Lanois]] collaborator [[Michael Brook]] (the creator of the [[infinite guitar]], which he regularly uses), working with him on the [[Captive (soundtrack)|score to the film ''Captive'']] (1986). From this soundtrack the song \"Heroine\", the vocal of which was sung by a young [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] was released as a single.\n\nHe also created the theme song for season one and two of ''[[The Batman (TV series)|The Batman]]''. He and fellow U2 member Bono wrote the theme of the 1995 [[James Bond]] film ''[[GoldenEye]]''. The Edge, along with Bono, composed a [[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark|musical adaptation]] of [[Spider-Man]]. On 25 May 2011, a single titled \"[[Rise Above 1]]\" by Reeve Carney featuring Bono and The Edge was released digitally.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/songreviews/rise-above-1-20110526|title=Rise Above 1 by Reeve Carney feat.

The film examines the history of the electric guitar, focusing on the careers and styles of the Edge, [[Jimmy Page]], and [[Jack White]]. The film premiered on 5 September 2008 at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]]\n\nOn 29 April 2016, the Edge performed in the [[Sistine Chapel]] as part of a conference for the Angiogensis Foundation, making him the first rock artist to stage a concert at the site.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/the-edge-becomes-first-rock-star-to-play-the-sistine-chapel-a7011056.html|title=The Edge becomes first rock star to play the Sistine Chapel|work=[[The Independent]]|first=Jess|last=Denham|date=3 May 2016|accessdate=3 May 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Equipment==\n[[Image:EdgeAC30.jpg|thumb|Edge's 1964 [[Vox AC30]] on stage in [[Foxborough]] for the [[U2 360\u00b0 Tour]].]]\nThe Edge plays electric guitar, acoustic guitar, keyboards, piano, bass guitar (on \"40\" and \"Race Against Time\") and [[lap steel guitar]].

Key to his signature sound are the use of modulated delays, namely a Korg SDD-3000 delay unit made in the early 80's, as well as a special Herdim guitar pick, which Edge holds upside down to expose the \"dimples\" when hitting the guitar strings to achieve a raspier chime.<ref>http://www.amnesta.net/edge_delay/herdim.html</ref> For his main amplification, The Edge uses a vintage Vox AC30 particularly a 1964 JMI-era \"Top Boost\" model chassis fitted into an early 70's cabinet.<ref name=\"musicradar.com\"/>  In 2016, [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] unveiled a signature guitar model, The Edge Signature Stratocaster, which The Edge has been using on the most recent tours to replace his vintage 70's Stratocasters.<ref>http://www.guitarworld.com/gear/edge-discusses-his-new-signature-fender-strat</ref> Around the same time Fender also unveiled a signature amp, the Fender Edge Deluxe.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:The Edge with Steve Censky and Dr William W Li at USDA HQ 6-19-2018.jpeg|thumb|The Edge with [[United States Deputy Secretary of Agriculture|US Deputy Secretary of Agriculture]] [[Stephen Censky]] and Angiogenesis Foundation co-founder Dr. William W.

The instruments were originally only replaced for professional musicians but they soon realised the community churches and schools needed instruments as well. The charity's slogan is \"Rebuilding the Gulf Region note by note\" and has so far helped over a hundred musicians who were affected by Hurricane Katrina.
