[[Saint Ignatius Loyola]], founder of [[Society of Jesus|The Society of Jesus]], sanctioned the foundation of his order's first school in 1548.\n\nThe [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]] have conducted educational institutions since their establishment in France in 1849 by [[Jean Gailhac|Father Jean Gailhac]]. These two traditions of education have come together in [[Los Angeles]] as Loyola Marymount University.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.lmu.edu/about/history|title=History - Loyola Marymount University|first=Loyola Marymount|last=University|website=Lmu.edu|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===St. Vincent's College===\nThe present university is the direct heir to the pioneer Catholic college and first institution of higher learning in [[Southern California]], St. Vincent's College, founded and run by the Vincentians until 1911.<ref name=\"ladowntownnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/the-school-the-city-forgot/article_d7d0b4ce-ef9f-57b3-8bb5-702a33b35ec7.html|title=The School The City Forgot|first=Jay|last=Berman|website=Los Angeles Downtown News - The Voice of Downtown Los Angeles}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://waterandpower.org/museum/California_Historical_Landmarks_Listing_LA_Page_2.html|title=Water and Power Associates|website=waterandpower.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1865, the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul|Vincentian Fathers]] were commissioned by Bishop [[Thaddeus Amat y Brusi]] to found St. Vincent's College for boys in [[Los Angeles]]. Father John Asmuth, was the first President Rector. Classes were held for two years in the [[Lugo Adobe]] on the east side of the Plaza while a new building was being finished. The historic home, aptly donated by Don Vicente Lugo, was one of few two-story adobes then in town. The house stood in the empty lot across Alameda Street between the Plaza and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]], (near [[Olvera Street]]).\n\nAfter two years, the college and school moved into a new, brick building several blocks south by the lower plaza, [[Pershing Square (Los Angeles)|Pershing Square]].\n\nLater, the brick building was replaced with a larger one in stone that became a familiar landmark for its stately, central tower topped by a mansard roof. The 7th street property, now called [[St. Vincent's Place]], took up the block bounded by Fort ([[7th Street (Los Angeles)#7th & Broadway|Broadway]]), 6th, Hill, and 7th streets. When St. Vincent's later moved to a new campus, the old building became US Army Headquarters, and in 1907, the large [[Bullock's]] department store was built and operated here until 1983. Today, the site is in the heart of Los Angeles's Jewelry District, encompassing St. Vincent Court. In 1869, St. Vincent's was accredited by the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterandpower.org/Historical_DWP_Photo_Collection_LA_Public_Library/St_Vincent_College(2).jpg|title=See description in watermark.|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Historic-Core-Angeles-Images-America-ebook/dp/B0093CI38C/ Historic Core of Los Angeles], amazon.com; accessed June 10, 2018.</ref>\n\n[[File:St Vincent\u2019s College Los Angeles.jpeg|thumb|left|500px|4.

Like the second college building by Pershing Square, the new retained a tall, central tower topped with St. Vincent's trademark mansard roof.<ref name=vince>{{cite web|url=http://www.stvincentla.net/school/about-svs/school-history|title=St. Vincent history|accessdate=September 2, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527091200/http://www.stvincentla.net/school/about-svs/school-history|archivedate=May 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"ladowntownnews.com\"/>\n\nWhile the campus underwent many expansions, the athletic program grew, and the Catholic Collegiates competed against Occidental's Presbyterians and USC's Methodists. St. Vincent's athletes were also recruited into professional sports. During this era, from St. Vincent's College graduated many alumni who would become famous in the history of Los Angeles, among whom were [[Isidore Dockweiler]], [[Eugene Biscailuz]] and [[Leo Carrillo]].<ref name=\"ladowntownnews.com\"/>\n\nIn 1911, the Vincentians, who had led the college since its founding the century before, were replaced with the Jesuits, who quickly moved the college to a larger property. As planning began on developing a 20th-century university, enrollment was folded into a new college, briefly called \"Los Angeles College\" that would soon evolve into Loyola. The old campus became St. Vincent's School.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stvincentla.net/school/?school_history|title=St. Vincent School|website=stvincentla.net}}</ref>  In 1922, St. Vincent's historic campus was sold. Over time, the historic buildings of old St. Vincent's College have been torn down and replaced, including with the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]] (1924) and large, open parking lots.<ref name=\"ladowntownnews.com\"/>\n\n===Beginnings of Loyola in L.A.===\nWhen the Vincentians pulled out of educational ministry in Los Angeles in 1911, [[Thomas James Conaty|Bishop Thomas Conaty]] asked the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] to come to Los Angeles and take over St. Vincent's College. Not wishing to assume any of the college's debt, the Jesuits, instead, founded Los Angeles College in 1911. They simultaneously opened their high school division ([[Loyola High School (Los Angeles)|Loyola High School]]) and folded the board, faculty, and students of St. Vincent's College into Los Angeles College at a new location made up of several bungalows at Avenue 52, Highland Park, Los Angeles.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nFather [[Richard A. Gleeson]], was the first Jesuit President but the board of the college was initially composed of Vincentian Fathers. Rapid growth prompted the Jesuits to seek a new campus on Venice Boulevard in 1917; with this move, the name of the school was changed back to St. Vincent's College. However, in 1918 the name was once again changed to Loyola College of Los Angeles.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nGraduate instruction began in 1920 with the foundation of a separate law school. Though instruction at the undergraduate level remained exclusive to male students, women were admitted to the law school. The law school was the second in Los Angeles to admit Jewish students. (USC's law school had done so at least since 1910.)<ref>Chaim Shapiro, 1910-13, and several graduates of the class of 1915. \"Stare Decisis\", USC law school yearbooks for 1913 and 1915, on file in USC Libraries archives.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.lls.edu/history.html|title=Alumni - Loyola Law School, Los Angeles|website=Alumni.lls.edu|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the undergraduate division of Loyola relocated, under then-President Joseph A. Sullivan, S.J., to the present [[Westchester, Los Angeles, California|Westchester]] campus, and achieved university status in 1930, becoming Loyola University of Los Angeles. [[Loyola Law School]] did not move with the rest of the university, but moved later to another location just west of [[downtown Los Angeles]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[World War II]] had a significant impact on Loyola University. As enrollment began to drop, Father Edward Whelan, president at the time, brokered a deal with the [[United States Army|US Army]] to form an officer training program for both [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] officers. The contract allowed the university to remain open during the war and enrollment hit all-time highs as a result of returning veterans taking advantage of the G.I. Bill in the mid-to-late 1940s. Additionally, Father Whelan recognized the grave injustice of the [[Japanese American Internment|Japanese internment camps]] during World War II. At Loyolay, he hired and housed many Japanese Americans returning to Los Angeles after their release from the camps. \nIn 1949, Father Charles Cassassa, was named president and began one of the most consequential presidencies in the university's history.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} His work included the formation of a graduate division on the Westchester campus in June 1950, graduate work having formed an integral part of the Teacher Education Program during the preceding two years, expanding campus infrastructure. He then established the Institute of Human Relations to promote improved racial relations in business and in government. Future Mayor of Los Angeles, [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] attended the first year-long program held by the Institute of Human Relations and remained lifelong friends with Father Cassassa.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nFather Cassassa also continued Father Whelan's legacy of combating racial injustice. In 1950, he forced the school's football team to forfeit an away game against [[University of Texas at El Paso|Texas Western]] since the school's rules prevented African-American players, such as Loyola's Bill English, to play on their field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://magazine.lmu.edu/archive/2010/no-one-left-behind|title=LMU Magazine : No One Left Behind|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref> During the Cassassa era, the law school moved to its current campus, designed by [[Frank Gehry]], in 1964. Loyola University also continued as an all-male school until its merger with Marymount College in 1973. There were, however, several notable exceptions.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe first exception occurred during the summer months, when the Loyola faculty offered classes for religious women (Catholic nuns) seeking undergraduate degrees. Many sisters from across Los Angeles and Orange County acquired their undergraduate degrees from Loyola. Additionally, women were admitted to several of Loyola's graduate programs prior to the affiliation and merger with Marymount College. Furthermore, there were several female students admitted to Marymount College who later matriculated into Loyola University during the two schools' five-year affiliation prior to 1973, primarily into Engineering and Business majors which Marymount did not offer.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Beginnings of Marymount in L.A.===\nIn separate though parallel developments, the [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]] began teaching local young women in 1923. Having been invited by [[John Joseph Cantwell|Bishop John Cantwell]], seven sisters of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, under the leadership of Mother Cecilia Rafter formed what was first an elementary school and, shortly thereafter, a high school. Within ten years, so many young women wished to continue their education with the Marymount sisters beyond high school that Marymount Junior College opened as an all-women's school on the [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]] campus of [[Marymount High School]] in 1933.\n\nMother Gertrude Cain was the first president of the junior college and guided its development into a four-year college in 1948, assuming the name Marymount College of Los Angeles. In 1960, having outgrown its shared Westwood campus, Marymount College moved both its two-year program and its four-year program to the [[Palos Verdes Peninsula]] in southwestern Los Angeles. The Palos Verdes campus became [[Marymount California University]].\n\nIn 1967 Sister Raymunde McKay, the president of Marymount College, extended an invitation to Sister Mary Felix Montgomery, General Superior of the [[Sisters of St. Joseph#United States \u2013 Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange|Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange]], to merge Marymount College with St. Joseph College of Orange, a four-year liberal arts college for women religious run by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange, which Sister Montgomery accepted. St. Joseph College was originally formed as St. Joseph Teacher's College, a junior college affiliated with [[The Catholic University of America]] in 1953. In 1959 it was incorporated as an autonomous, four-year institution and assumed the St. Joseph College name.\n\nIn 1968 Marymount and St. Joseph's Colleges merged under the Marymount name with an agreement that the traditions and heritage of both the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange would be carried in the Marymount name. As part of the Marymount College Agreement, Marymount College was administered \"co-equally\" by the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange as members of both communities partnered in the governing, staffing, and teaching of Marymount College.\n\nSubsequently, St. Joseph College of Orange was renamed Marymount College of Orange. During the academic year, it remained a college for women religious seeking their baccalaureate degrees; college courses were offered to men and women during the summers at the Orange campus. The same year, Marymount College began its affiliation with Loyola University, moving its four-year program at the Palos Verdes campus to the Westchester campus of Loyola University. Marymount College then operated on three campuses: Palos Verdes retained its two-year program, Orange remained a campus for women religious in Orange County, and Westchester was a campus for both lay and religious women.<ref name=vince/>\n\n===Affiliation and merger of Loyola and Marymount===\nBy the mid-1960s, Loyola University of Los Angeles had unsuccessfully petitioned the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archbishop of Los Angeles]], Cardinal [[James Francis McIntyre]], to allow coeducation at Loyola for several years. In 1967, however, Sister McKay, President of Marymount College, received permission from Cardinal McIntyre to begin affiliation with Loyola University on Loyola's Westchester campus. Sister McKay and Father Charles Cassassa, President of Loyola University, held a joint press conference to announce the affiliation.\n\nThe affiliation of Marymount College and Loyola University began in 1968 when Marymount's four-year program moved to Loyola's Westchester campus; this arrangement (two independent schools on one campus) continued for five years. In 1970, the Student Governments of Loyola University (ASLU\u2014Associated Students of Loyola University) and Marymount College (ASMC\u2014Associated Students of Marymount College) joined to form the Associated Students of Loyola and Marymount (ASLM).\n\nAfter five years of sharing faculties and facilities, Loyola University and Marymount College merged and assumed the name Loyola Marymount University in 1973. Through this union, the expanded university maintained the century-old mission of Catholic higher education in [[Los Angeles]] and incorporated the educational traditions of the Jesuits, Marymount sisters, and Orange sisters into one institution. At this time, ASLM became known as the Associated Students of Loyola Marymount University (ASLMU).\n\nFather [[Donald Merrifield]], who became president of Loyola University in 1969, continued as the university's president.<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/02/local/la-me-donald-merrifield2-2010mar02|title=Donald P.

In 2010, Marymount College, Palos Verdes received accreditation as a four-year institution.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nWith the merger of Loyola University and Marymount College in 1973, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange joined the Society of Jesus and the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary as one of the sponsoring religious communities of Loyola Marymount University. Marymount College of Orange was renamed the Orange Campus of Loyola Marymount University. The Orange Campus offered continuing education and summer courses to men and women through the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Recent history===\nIn 2007, the university reestablished its presence in [[Orange County, California]] when the Theological Studies Department began offering a two-year master's program in Pastoral Theology in [[Orange, California]].

Prior to 2009, a prerequisite to serve as the university's president was membership in the Society of Jesus; however, the board of trustees voted to allow educators not a part of the Jesuit Order to become president. These changes were made at the recommendation of the American Assistancy of Jesuits, the collective body of Jesuits in the United States in response to the declining number of Jesuits as well as those prepared to serve as the president of a major university. See a [[List of Presidents of Loyola Marymount University|list of past presidents]].\n\nThe president is assisted by the chancellor, assistant to the president, director internal audit, the vice president for mission and ministry (under whose direction the Office of Campus Ministry and the Center for Ignatian Spirituality operates) and the vice president for intercultural affairs. The executive vice president & provost reports directly to the president and oversees all campus operations.\n\nThe university cabinet consists of: the president, executive vice president & provost, senior vice president & chief academic officer (under whose direction the deans of the Bellarmine College of Liberal Arts, College of Business Administration, College of Communication and Fine Arts, Seaver College of Science and Engineering, School of Education, School of Film and Television, and University Libraries operate), senior vice president for administration, senior vice president & chief financial officer, senior vice president for student affairs, senior vice president for university relations, and senior vice president Fritz B.

However, other religious orders such as the [[Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] (Carmelites) and the Sisters of Saint Louis have members employed on campus.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Society of Jesus===\nThe Jesuit Community of LMU is the largest in the California Province of the [[Society of Jesus]]. The campus's Jesuits were housed in Xavier Hall until the recent completion of the new Jesuit Community Complex. LMU is home to 51 Jesuits (2006\u20132007 academic school year) holding various positions in administrative, staff, and faculty positions throughout the university. Even though there are a lot of Jesuits on the campus, the majority of them are not involved with school.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary===\nThe [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]] also house several religious sisters adjacent campus. From 1968 until 1999 the sisters lived on campus in the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center. In 1999, they donated the building to the university and moved into residential houses off campus. The Western American provincial center, which had been in the Leavey center, was moved to [[Montebello, California|Montebello]]. The Marymount Sisters sponsor the Marymount Institute for Faith, Culture, and the Arts which attempts to preserve the transformative educational tradition of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and promotes a dialogue between faith and culture as expressed in fine, performing, literary and communication arts.<ref name=\"University\"/>\n\n===Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange===\nLike the Jesuits and Marymount Sisters, the [[Sisters of St. Joseph#United States \u2013 Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange|Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange]] play a great role in preserving the Roman Catholic identity of the school. Several sisters of the order reside adjacent to the campus, working in administrative, staff, and faculty roles.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Campus ministry==\n{{one source|section|date=April 2018}}\nLoyola Marymount's Office of Campus Ministry is a component to the promotion of the university's mission and identity. Founded in 1911 as the University Chaplain, this division became known as Campus Ministry in 1973 with a stipulation that the Director would be a Jesuit. By 1986 this requirement was waived when Sr. Margaret Mary Dolan, R.S.H.M. became the director. Dolan, an alumna of Marymount College's class of 1958, received her Master's from LMU in 1974 and also served the university as a campus minister, director of alumni relations, residence hall minister, and alumni chaplain since 1973.\n\nIn 2008, as part of the university's Centennial Capital Campaign, it was announced that an $8 million fundraising goal was set to endow the office as the \"Peg Dolan, RSHM Campus Ministry Center\" in honor of Dolan's contributions to the university. The same year, the university asked her to address the class of 2008 at the undergraduate commencement exercises and she was awarded an honorary doctorate. At the dedication ceremony in September 2008, over 700 alumni returned to campus to honor her legacy at the university. When Dolan died in 2009, more than 1,000 people returned to campus for two days of liturgies celebrating her life.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mission.lmu.edu/ministry/|title=Campus Ministry - Loyola Marymount University|first=Loyola Marymount|last=University|website=Mission.lmu.edu|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\nLocated at the north end of the university, Sacred Heart Chapel is the main worship space on campus. A basilica-style church, Sacred Heart has two side altars and the Mary chapel, which is located behind the crucifix, in addition to the main chapel space. The chapel is lined by tall stained glass windows. Each window bears the seal of one of the 28 other [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] universities in the United States; additionally, following the 1973 merger, edged glass window of the other four [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary|Marymount]] colleges and universities in the United States were added.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Academy of Catholic Thought and Imagination==\nThe Academy of Catholic Thought and Imagination (ACTI) at Loyola Marymount University is a community of scholars who work in dialogue with the Roman Catholic intellectual tradition by developing, examining, communicating, or otherwise engaging the resources of Catholic thought and imagination, especially as it is informed by the Jesuit vision of Ignatius of Loyola. The Academy is a hub for scholarship, interdisciplinary research, pedagogy, and outreach on LMU's campus and in the southwest United States. ACTI sponsors and co-sponsors events, supports interdisciplinary dialogue within the university, and publishes academic work promoting its mission. Founded in April 2014 and Directed by Dr. Brian Treanor, ACTI has been sponsoring and organizing events since April 2015.<ref name=cent>{{cite web|url=http://lmu.edu/research/centersinstitutes/|title=Centers + Institutes - Loyola Marymount University|first=Loyola Marymount|last=University|website=Lmu.edu|accessdate=2 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n==The Marymount Institute for Faith, Culture, and the Arts==\nFounded in 1991, the Marymount Institute was designed to help strengthen the legacy and contributions of the Marymount tradition at LMU, and encourages interdisciplinary and intercultural scholarly and artistic activity in the form of research, publication, exhibits, performances, conferences, seminars, and lectures.\n\n2008 saw the opening of the Marymount Institute Press. Itself an imprint of Tsehai Publishers and Distributors, the MIP was founded by the Ethiopian-born journalist, publisher, and social activist, Elias Wondimu, and already has two publications to its credit: \"Panim el Panim: Facing Genesis, Visual Midrash\" and \"A Journey into Love: Meditating with Piers Plowman\".\n\nThe President's Marymount Institute Professor in Residence is Nobel Laureate [[Wole Soyinka]].<ref name=cent/>\n\n==Athletics==\n{{one source|section|date=April 2018}}\n{{Main|Loyola Marymount Lions}}\nAthletic teams at Loyola Marymount are known as Lions; the school's primary athletic affiliation is with the [[West Coast Conference]]. While LMU has had success in several sports, it is probably best remembered for its men's [[basketball]] teams between 1985 and 1990, with [[Paul Westhead]] as coach and for the death of star player [[Hank Gathers]] (#44), who collapsed during the second round of the WCC tournament on March 4, 1990, and for his friendship with teammate [[Bo Kimble]] (#30). Their jerseys have been retired at LMU.\n\nEspecially well-remembered was the 1990 team, led by Gathers and Kimble until tragedy struck in the WCC tournament. Gathers collapsed during a game and died due to a previously diagnosed heart condition. Playing for their fallen teammate, the Lions advanced to the Elite Eight (regional final) of the [[1990 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] before falling to eventual champions [[1989\u201390 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV]].\n\nThe primary indoor athletic facility is the [[Gersten Pavilion]].\n[[Los Angeles Angels|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] starting pitcher [[C.

It owns more titles than any other PCSC (Pacific Coast Softball Conference) team, with three in 2003, 2005, and 2007. In 2007, Tiffany Pagano and LMU beat UCLA 4-2 in the Los Angeles regional in the NCAA Tournament, to mark their first win over the Bruins, and the first time that UCLA had not won a regional and advanced to the Women's College World Series.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lmulions.com|title=Loyola Marymount Official Athletic Site|website=LMULIONS.com|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Student government==\nASLMU, The Associated Students of Loyola Marymount University, is the functioning student government.

Its regular sections include News, Opinion, Sports and Life+Arts. Special sections include Business, Travel, Cartoon and the parody section, named The Bluff after LMU's distinctive landmark.\n\nIn 2005, the paper won the Columbia Scholastic Press Association award for \"Best Four-Year Weekly Tabloid.\" In 2011\u20132012, the ''Loyolan''{{'}}s website, laloyolan.com, won a Gold Crown, presented by the Columbia Scholastic Press Association.

It was first on the air in 1957, and recently celebrated its 60th anniversary. It is a non-commercial college radio station that plays many styles of music broadly classified under rock, specialty, fine arts, and Latin jazz.\n\nKXLU has an annual fundraising drive known as \"fundrazor\" which supports the station's ongoing operation. The station has a large following in the Los Angeles area. KXLU is also the 'flagship' station for LMU athletics featuring every Lions Men's basketball game each season.\n\nThe university boasts both an AM/closed circuit and FM radio station.

The ten service organizations work to help the university and surrounding community of Los Angeles. Each service organization has its own unique mission, history, charism and organizational structure. The members of these organizations make themselves available for on-campus service as well as on-going commitments to serve at specific non-profit agencies in Southern California. Each organization has a moderator and a chaplain (though in some of the organizations the same priest or woman religious serves as both moderator and chaplain).\n\nThe Center for Service and Action works with the service organizations in fostering on-campus service and community service as well as reflecting upon their experience of service. CSA coordinates communication between the leadership of these organizations, the Service Organization Council. CSA also coordinates the distribution of the On-Campus Service Requests.\n\nThe organizations and their respective dates of founding are Crimson Circle (1929), Belles (1960), Gryphon Circle (1968), Ignatians (1981), Sursum Corda (1992), Marians (2003), Magis (2003), Creare (2009), Esp\u00e9rer (2012), and Agap\u00e9 (2017).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.lmu.edu/activitiesservice/centerforserviceaction|title=Service|accessdate=September 2, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170415063636/http://studentaffairs.lmu.edu/activitiesservice/centerforserviceaction|archivedate=April 15, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Fraternities and sororities==\nLMU is also home to a number of campus Greek organizations.

[[Saint Ignatius Loyola]], founder of [[Society of Jesus|The Society of Jesus]], sanctioned the foundation of his order's first school in 1548.\n\nThe [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]] have conducted educational institutions since their establishment in France in 1849 by [[Jean Gailhac|Father Jean Gailhac]]. These two traditions of education have come together in [[Los Angeles]] as Loyola Marymount University.<ref name=history>{{cite web|url=http://www.lmu.edu/about/history|title=History - Loyola Marymount University|first=Loyola Marymount|last=University|website=Lmu.edu|accessdate=September 2, 2017}}</ref>\n\n===St. Vincent's College===\nThe present university is the direct heir to the pioneer Catholic college and first institution of higher learning in [[Southern California]], St. Vincent's College, founded and run by the Vincentians until 1911.<ref name=\"ladowntownnews.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ladowntownnews.com/news/the-school-the-city-forgot/article_d7d0b4ce-ef9f-57b3-8bb5-702a33b35ec7.html|title=The School The City Forgot|first=Jay|last=Berman|website=Los Angeles Downtown News - The Voice of Downtown Los Angeles}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://waterandpower.org/museum/California_Historical_Landmarks_Listing_LA_Page_2.html|title=Water and Power Associates|website=waterandpower.org}}</ref>\n\nIn 1865, the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul|Vincentian Fathers]] were commissioned by Bishop [[Thaddeus Amat y Brusi]] to found St. Vincent's College for boys in [[Los Angeles]]. Father John Asmuth, was the first President Rector. Classes were held for two years in the [[Lugo Adobe]] on the east side of the Plaza while a new building was being finished. The historic home, aptly donated by Don Vicente Lugo, was one of few two-story adobes then in town. The house stood in the empty lot across Alameda Street between the Plaza and [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]], (near [[Olvera Street]]).\n\nAfter two years, the college and school moved into a new, brick building several blocks south by the lower plaza, [[Pershing Square (Los Angeles)|Pershing Square]].\n\nLater, the brick building was replaced with a larger one in stone that became a familiar landmark for its stately, central tower topped by a mansard roof. The 7th street property, now called [[St. Vincent's Place]], took up the block bounded by Fort ([[7th Street (Los Angeles)#7th & Broadway|Broadway]]), 6th, Hill, and 7th streets. When St. Vincent's later moved to a new campus, the old building became US Army Headquarters, and in 1907, the large [[Bullock's]] department store was built and operated here until 1983. Today, the site is in the heart of Los Angeles's Jewelry District, encompassing St. Vincent Court. In 1869, St. Vincent's was accredited by the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://waterandpower.org/Historical_DWP_Photo_Collection_LA_Public_Library/St_Vincent_College(2).jpg|title=See description in watermark.|publisher=}}</ref><ref>[https://www.amazon.com/Historic-Core-Angeles-Images-America-ebook/dp/B0093CI38C/ Historic Core of Los Angeles], amazon.com; accessed June 10, 2018.</ref>\n\n[[File:St Vincent\u2019s College Los Angeles.jpeg|thumb|left|500px|4.

Like the second college building by Pershing Square, the new retained a tall, central tower topped with St. Vincent's trademark mansard roof.<ref name=vince>{{cite web|url=http://www.stvincentla.net/school/about-svs/school-history|title=St. Vincent history|accessdate=September 2, 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527091200/http://www.stvincentla.net/school/about-svs/school-history|archivedate=May 27, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"ladowntownnews.com\"/>\n\nWhile the campus underwent many expansions, the athletic program grew, and the Catholic Collegiates competed against Occidental's Presbyterians and USC's Methodists. St. Vincent's athletes were also recruited into professional sports. During this era, from St. Vincent's College graduated many alumni who would become famous in the history of Los Angeles, among whom were [[Isidore Dockweiler]], [[Eugene Biscailuz]] and [[Leo Carrillo]].<ref name=\"ladowntownnews.com\"/>\n\nIn 1911, the Vincentians, who had led the college since its founding the century before, were replaced with the Jesuits, who quickly moved the college to a larger property. As planning began on developing a 20th-century university, enrollment was folded into a new college, briefly called \"Los Angeles College\" that would soon evolve into Loyola. The old campus became St. Vincent's School.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://stvincentla.net/school/?school_history|title=St. Vincent School|website=stvincentla.net}}</ref>  In 1922, St. Vincent's historic campus was sold. Over time, the historic buildings of old St. Vincent's College have been torn down and replaced, including with the [[Grand Olympic Auditorium]] (1924) and large, open parking lots.<ref name=\"ladowntownnews.com\"/>\n\n===Beginnings of Loyola in L.A.===\nWhen the Vincentians pulled out of educational ministry in Los Angeles in 1911, [[Thomas James Conaty|Bishop Thomas Conaty]] asked the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] to come to Los Angeles and take over St. Vincent's College. Not wishing to assume any of the college's debt, the Jesuits, instead, founded Los Angeles College in 1911. They simultaneously opened their high school division ([[Loyola High School (Los Angeles)|Loyola High School]]) and folded the board, faculty, and students of St. Vincent's College into Los Angeles College at a new location made up of several bungalows at Avenue 52, Highland Park, Los Angeles.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nFather [[Richard A. Gleeson]], was the first Jesuit President but the board of the college was initially composed of Vincentian Fathers. Rapid growth prompted the Jesuits to seek a new campus on Venice Boulevard in 1917; with this move, the name of the school was changed back to St. Vincent's College. However, in 1918 the name was once again changed to Loyola College of Los Angeles.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nGraduate instruction began in 1920 with the foundation of a separate law school. Though instruction at the undergraduate level remained exclusive to male students, women were admitted to the law school. The law school was the second in Los Angeles to admit Jewish students. (USC's law school had done so at least since 1910.)<ref>Chaim Shapiro, 1910-13, and several graduates of the class of 1915. \"Stare Decisis\", USC law school yearbooks for 1913 and 1915, on file in USC Libraries archives.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://alumni.lls.edu/history.html|title=Alumni - Loyola Law School, Los Angeles|website=Alumni.lls.edu|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1928, the undergraduate division of Loyola relocated, under then-President Joseph A. Sullivan, S.J., to the present [[Westchester, Los Angeles, California|Westchester]] campus, and achieved university status in 1930, becoming Loyola University of Los Angeles. [[Loyola Law School]] did not move with the rest of the university, but moved later to another location just west of [[downtown Los Angeles]].{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n[[World War II]] had a significant impact on Loyola University. As enrollment began to drop, Father Edward Whelan, president at the time, brokered a deal with the [[United States Army|US Army]] to form an officer training program for both [[United States Army|Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] officers. The contract allowed the university to remain open during the war and enrollment hit all-time highs as a result of returning veterans taking advantage of the G.I. Bill in the mid-to-late 1940s. Additionally, Father Whelan recognized the grave injustice of the [[Japanese American Internment|Japanese internment camps]] during World War II. At Loyolay, he hired and housed many Japanese Americans returning to Los Angeles after their release from the camps. \nIn 1949, Father Charles Cassassa, was named president and began one of the most consequential presidencies in the university's history.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} His work included the formation of a graduate division on the Westchester campus in June 1950, graduate work having formed an integral part of the Teacher Education Program during the preceding two years, expanding campus infrastructure. He then established the Institute of Human Relations to promote improved racial relations in business and in government. Future Mayor of Los Angeles, [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Tom Bradley]] attended the first year-long program held by the Institute of Human Relations and remained lifelong friends with Father Cassassa.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nFather Cassassa also continued Father Whelan's legacy of combating racial injustice. In 1950, he forced the school's football team to forfeit an away game against [[University of Texas at El Paso|Texas Western]] since the school's rules prevented African-American players, such as Loyola's Bill English, to play on their field.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://magazine.lmu.edu/archive/2010/no-one-left-behind|title=LMU Magazine : No One Left Behind|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref> During the Cassassa era, the law school moved to its current campus, designed by [[Frank Gehry]], in 1964. Loyola University also continued as an all-male school until its merger with Marymount College in 1973. There were, however, several notable exceptions.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe first exception occurred during the summer months, when the Loyola faculty offered classes for religious women (Catholic nuns) seeking undergraduate degrees. Many sisters from across Los Angeles and Orange County acquired their undergraduate degrees from Loyola. Additionally, women were admitted to several of Loyola's graduate programs prior to the affiliation and merger with Marymount College. Furthermore, there were several female students admitted to Marymount College who later matriculated into Loyola University during the two schools' five-year affiliation prior to 1973, primarily into Engineering and Business majors which Marymount did not offer.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Beginnings of Marymount in L.A.===\nIn separate though parallel developments, the [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]] began teaching local young women in 1923. Having been invited by [[John Joseph Cantwell|Bishop John Cantwell]], seven sisters of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary, under the leadership of Mother Cecilia Rafter formed what was first an elementary school and, shortly thereafter, a high school. Within ten years, so many young women wished to continue their education with the Marymount sisters beyond high school that Marymount Junior College opened as an all-women's school on the [[Westwood, Los Angeles, California|Westwood]] campus of [[Marymount High School]] in 1933.\n\nMother Gertrude Cain was the first president of the junior college and guided its development into a four-year college in 1948, assuming the name Marymount College of Los Angeles. In 1960, having outgrown its shared Westwood campus, Marymount College moved both its two-year program and its four-year program to the [[Palos Verdes Peninsula]] in southwestern Los Angeles. The Palos Verdes campus became [[Marymount California University]].\n\nIn 1967 Sister Raymunde McKay, the president of Marymount College, extended an invitation to Sister Mary Felix Montgomery, General Superior of the [[Sisters of St. Joseph#United States \u2013 Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange|Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange]], to merge Marymount College with St. Joseph College of Orange, a four-year liberal arts college for women religious run by the Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange, which Sister Montgomery accepted. St. Joseph College was originally formed as St. Joseph Teacher's College, a junior college affiliated with [[The Catholic University of America]] in 1953. In 1959 it was incorporated as an autonomous, four-year institution and assumed the St. Joseph College name.\n\nIn 1968 Marymount and St. Joseph's Colleges merged under the Marymount name with an agreement that the traditions and heritage of both the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange would be carried in the Marymount name. As part of the Marymount College Agreement, Marymount College was administered \"co-equally\" by the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange as members of both communities partnered in the governing, staffing, and teaching of Marymount College.\n\nSubsequently, St. Joseph College of Orange was renamed Marymount College of Orange. During the academic year, it remained a college for women religious seeking their baccalaureate degrees; college courses were offered to men and women during the summers at the Orange campus. The same year, Marymount College began its affiliation with Loyola University, moving its four-year program at the Palos Verdes campus to the Westchester campus of Loyola University. Marymount College then operated on three campuses: Palos Verdes retained its two-year program, Orange remained a campus for women religious in Orange County, and Westchester was a campus for both lay and religious women.<ref name=vince/>\n\n===Affiliation and merger of Loyola and Marymount===\nBy the mid-1960s, Loyola University of Los Angeles had unsuccessfully petitioned the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles|Archbishop of Los Angeles]], Cardinal [[James Francis McIntyre]], to allow coeducation at Loyola for several years. In 1967, however, Sister McKay, President of Marymount College, received permission from Cardinal McIntyre to begin affiliation with Loyola University on Loyola's Westchester campus. Sister McKay and Father Charles Cassassa, President of Loyola University, held a joint press conference to announce the affiliation.\n\nThe affiliation of Marymount College and Loyola University began in 1968 when Marymount's four-year program moved to Loyola's Westchester campus; this arrangement (two independent schools on one campus) continued for five years. In 1970, the Student Governments of Loyola University (ASLU\u2014Associated Students of Loyola University) and Marymount College (ASMC\u2014Associated Students of Marymount College) joined to form the Associated Students of Loyola and Marymount (ASLM).\n\nAfter five years of sharing faculties and facilities, Loyola University and Marymount College merged and assumed the name Loyola Marymount University in 1973. Through this union, the expanded university maintained the century-old mission of Catholic higher education in [[Los Angeles]] and incorporated the educational traditions of the Jesuits, Marymount sisters, and Orange sisters into one institution. At this time, ASLM became known as the Associated Students of Loyola Marymount University (ASLMU).\n\nFather [[Donald Merrifield]], who became president of Loyola University in 1969, continued as the university's president.<ref name=\"latimes\">{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/02/local/la-me-donald-merrifield2-2010mar02|title=Donald P.

In 2010, Marymount College, Palos Verdes received accreditation as a four-year institution.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nWith the merger of Loyola University and Marymount College in 1973, the Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange joined the Society of Jesus and the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary as one of the sponsoring religious communities of Loyola Marymount University.

The university's executive officer is the president. Prior to 2009, a prerequisite to serve as the university's president was membership in the Society of Jesus; however, the board of trustees voted to allow educators not a part of the Jesuit Order to become president. These changes were made at the recommendation of the American Assistancy of Jesuits, the collective body of Jesuits in the United States in response to the declining number of Jesuits as well as those prepared to serve as the president of a major university. See a [[List of Presidents of Loyola Marymount University|list of past presidents]].\n\nThe president is assisted by the chancellor, assistant to the president, director internal audit, the vice president for mission and ministry (under whose direction the Office of Campus Ministry and the Center for Ignatian Spirituality operates) and the vice president for intercultural affairs. The executive vice president & provost reports directly to the president and oversees all campus operations.\n\nThe university cabinet consists of: the president, executive vice president & provost, senior vice president & chief academic officer (under whose direction the deans of the Bellarmine College of Liberal Arts, College of Business Administration, College of Communication and Fine Arts, Seaver College of Science and Engineering, School of Education, School of Film and Television, and University Libraries operate), senior vice president for administration, senior vice president & chief financial officer, senior vice president for student affairs, senior vice president for university relations, and senior vice president Fritz B.

However, other religious orders such as the [[Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]] (Carmelites) and the Sisters of Saint Louis have members employed on campus.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Society of Jesus===\nThe Jesuit Community of LMU is the largest in the California Province of the [[Society of Jesus]]. The campus's Jesuits were housed in Xavier Hall until the recent completion of the new Jesuit Community Complex. LMU is home to 51 Jesuits (2006\u20132007 academic school year) holding various positions in administrative, staff, and faculty positions throughout the university. Even though there are a lot of Jesuits on the campus, the majority of them are not involved with school.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n===Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary===\nThe [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]] also house several religious sisters adjacent campus. From 1968 until 1999 the sisters lived on campus in the Thomas and Dorothy Leavey Center. In 1999, they donated the building to the university and moved into residential houses off campus. The Western American provincial center, which had been in the Leavey center, was moved to [[Montebello, California|Montebello]]. The Marymount Sisters sponsor the Marymount Institute for Faith, Culture, and the Arts which attempts to preserve the transformative educational tradition of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary and promotes a dialogue between faith and culture as expressed in fine, performing, literary and communication arts.<ref name=\"University\"/>\n\n===Sisters of Saint Joseph of Orange===\nLike the Jesuits and Marymount Sisters, the [[Sisters of St. Joseph#United States \u2013 Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange|Sisters of St. Joseph of Orange]] play a great role in preserving the Roman Catholic identity of the school. Several sisters of the order reside adjacent to the campus, working in administrative, staff, and faculty roles.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n==Campus ministry==\n{{one source|section|date=April 2018}}\nLoyola Marymount's Office of Campus Ministry is a component to the promotion of the university's mission and identity. Founded in 1911 as the University Chaplain, this division became known as Campus Ministry in 1973 with a stipulation that the Director would be a Jesuit. By 1986 this requirement was waived when Sr. Margaret Mary Dolan, R.S.H.M. became the director. Dolan, an alumna of Marymount College's class of 1958, received her Master's from LMU in 1974 and also served the university as a campus minister, director of alumni relations, residence hall minister, and alumni chaplain since 1973.\n\nIn 2008, as part of the university's Centennial Capital Campaign, it was announced that an $8 million fundraising goal was set to endow the office as the \"Peg Dolan, RSHM Campus Ministry Center\" in honor of Dolan's contributions to the university. The same year, the university asked her to address the class of 2008 at the undergraduate commencement exercises and she was awarded an honorary doctorate.

Gathers collapsed during a game and died due to a previously diagnosed heart condition. Playing for their fallen teammate, the Lions advanced to the Elite Eight (regional final) of the [[1990 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] before falling to eventual champions [[1989\u201390 UNLV Runnin' Rebels basketball team|UNLV]].\n\nThe primary indoor athletic facility is the [[Gersten Pavilion]].\n[[Los Angeles Angels|Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]] starting pitcher [[C.

After his role in ''Dyslexia'' was critically acclaimed, Phoenix was almost immediately cast as a major role in his next made-for-TV movie, ''[[Surviving: A Family in Crisis]]''.

Released in the summer of 1985, this was Phoenix's first major motion picture role. In October 1986, Phoenix co-starred alongside [[Tuesday Weld]] and [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]] in the acclaimed [[CBS]] television movie ''[[Circle of Violence: A Family Drama]]'', which told a story of domestic [[elder abuse]]. This was Phoenix's last television role before achieving film stardom.\n\n===1986\u20131993: Critical success in ''Stand By Me'', ''Running on Empty'', ''My Own Private Idaho''===\nAt 15, Phoenix had a significant role in [[Rob Reiner]]'s popular coming-of-age film ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' (1986), which made him a household name. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined that Phoenix gave the film its \"centre of gravity\".<ref name=\"The Independent\"/> Phoenix commented: \"The truth is, I identified so much with the role of Chris Chambers that if I hadn't had my family to go back to after the shoot, I'd have probably had to see a psychiatrist.\"<ref name=Tribune/> Later that year Phoenix completed [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), playing the son of [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Helen Mirren]]'s characters. \"He was obviously going to be a movie star,\" observed Weir. \"It's something apart from acting ability.

In 1991, Phoenix filmed an acclaimed independent picture called ''[[Dogfight (film)|Dogfight]]'' co-starring [[Lili Taylor]] and directed by [[Nancy Savoca]]. In the romantic coming-of-age drama set in San Francisco, Phoenix portrayed a young U.S. Marine on the night before he was shipped off to Vietnam in November 1963. Taylor remarked that Phoenix suffered because he could not distance himself from his character: \"He also hadn't gotten into any [drugs]&nbsp;\u2013 he was just drinking then, too. It was different ... That was actually a hard part for him, because it was so radically different from who he was. He was such a hippie, and here he was playing this marine.

In his review for ''[[Newsweek]]'', David Ansen praised Phoenix's performance: \"The campfire scene in which Mike awkwardly declares his unrequited love for Scott is a marvel of delicacy. In this, and every scene, Phoenix immerses himself so deeply inside his character you almost forget you've seen him before: it's a stunningly sensitive performance, poignant and comic at once\". \n\nFor his role in ''My Own Private Idaho'', Phoenix won Best Actor honors at the [[Venice Film Festival]], the [[National Society of Film Critics]] and the [[Independent Spirit Awards]]. The film and its success solidified Phoenix's image as an actor with edgy, leading man potential. In that period Phoenix was beginning to use [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]] and heroin with some friends.<ref name=\"people\"/><ref name=\"High Life\">{{cite journal|last1=Schindehette|first1=Susan|last2=Stambler|first2=Lyndon|last3=Dodd|first3=Johnny|last4=Benet|first4=Lorenzo|last5=Stone|first5=Joanna|title=High Life|journal=People|date=January 17, 1994|volume=41|issue=2|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20107312,00.html|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref> \n\nIn the book Gus Van Sant wrote about Phoenix, ''Pink'', the director said clearly that Phoenix was not a regular drug user but only an occasional one, and that the actor had a more serious problem with alcohol. Phoenix had always tried to hide his addictions because he feared that they might ruin his career as they did his relationship with Martha Plimpton.\n\nPhoenix teamed up with [[Robert Redford]] and again with Sidney Poitier for the conspiracy/espionage thriller ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' (1992). A month later he began production on [[Sam Shepard]]'s art-house ghost western ''[[Silent Tongue]]'' (which was released in 1994); he also was beaten out for the role of Paul by [[Brad Pitt]] in ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]''. He made a cameo appearance in Van Sant's ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|Even Cowgirls get the Blues]]'' (1993), co-starring his sister Rain. Phoenix then starred in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s country music-themed film, ''[[The Thing Called Love]]'' (1993), the last completed picture before his death.

Phoenix was a singer, songwriter, and an accomplished guitarist. He had begun teaching himself guitar at the age of five and had stated in an interview for ''E!'' in 1988 that his family's move to Los Angeles when he was nine was made so that he and his sister \"could become recording artists. I fell into commercials for financial reasons and acting became an attractive concept\".  Prior to securing an acting agent, Phoenix and his siblings tried to forge a career in music by playing cover versions on the streets of the Westwood district of LA, often being moved along by police because gathering crowds would obstruct the pavement. From the first fruits of his film success, Phoenix saved $650 to obtain his prized possession, a guitar with which he wrote what he described as \"progressive, ethereal folk-rock\".<ref name=Tribune/>\n\nWhile working on ''[[A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon]]'' in 1986, Phoenix had written and recorded a song, \"Heart to Get\", specifically for the end credits of the movie. 20th Century Fox cut it from the completed film, but director William Richert put it back into place for his director's cut some years later. It was during filming that Phoenix met [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]]; this meeting would later secure Phoenix a two-year development deal with the label. Phoenix disliked the idea of being a solo artist and relished collaboration; therefore he focused on putting together a band. [[Aleka's Attic]] were formed in 1987 and the lineup included his sister Rain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3209145.stm|title=Entertainment: A decade without River Phoenix|work=BBC News|date=October 31, 2003|accessdate=August 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nPhoenix was committed to gaining credibility by his own merit and maintained that the band would not use his name when securing performances that were not benefits for charitable organizations.

While working on the film ''[[The Thing Called Love]]'' in 1993, Phoenix wrote and recorded the song \"[[Lone Star State of Mine]]\", which he performs in the movie. The song was not included on the film's soundtrack album. In 1996, the Aleka's Attic track \"Note to a Friend\" was released on the 1996 benefit album ''In Defense of Animals; Volume II'' and featured Flea of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] on bass. Phoenix had collaborated with friend [[John Frusciante]] after his first departure from [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and the songs \"Height Down\" and \"Well I've Been\" were released on Frusciante's second solo album ''[[Smile from the Streets You Hold]]'' in 1997. Phoenix was an investor in the original [[House of Blues]] (founded by his good friend and ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' co-star [[Dan Aykroyd]]) in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], which opened its doors to the public after serving a group of homeless people on Thanksgiving Day 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9y9KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YIUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3101,4159902&dq=river-phoenix+house-of-blues&hl=en |title=The Vindicator \u2013 Google News Archive Search |publisher= |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Activism==\nPhoenix was a dedicated [[animal rights]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]] and political activist.

Forrest said that in the days leading up to his death, Phoenix was staying with [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarist [[John Frusciante]]. The two would do large amounts of drugs together, embarking on huge binges, and barely if ever slept. He said the drug routine was consistent for all of them, as he was there doing drugs with them. First they would smoke [[crack cocaine|crack]] or inject cocaine intravenously, then inject heroin.\n\nOn the evening of October 30, 1993, Phoenix was to perform with the band [[P (group)|P]] which featured his good friends [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, actor [[Johnny Depp]], [[Gibby Haynes]] of the [[Butthole Surfers]] along with [[Al Jourgensen]] of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] at [[The Viper Room]], a Hollywood nightclub partly owned at the time by Depp.<ref name=\"High Life\" /> Forrest claims that Phoenix and Frusciante arrived at the club together where they would meet up with Phoenix's girlfriend [[Samantha Mathis]], Phoenix's brother [[Joaquin Phoenix|Joaquin]], and their sister [[Rain Phoenix|Rain]], along with Flea and Depp. After arriving, cocaine was immediately passed around. Forrest later said that Phoenix was obviously already high and was, as he put it, \"unsteady as a boxer who had taken one too many head-shots during a fifteen-round bout.\"\n\nDuring the performance by P, Forrest said that Phoenix tapped him on the shoulder to tell him he was not feeling well, and that he thought he had overdosed. Forrest said to Phoenix that he didn't think that he was overdosing because he could stand and talk. Nonetheless, he offered to take Phoenix home, but Phoenix declined, saying he was feeling better. A few moments later, Forrest said that a commotion erupted in the club and he went outside to find Mathis screaming as her boyfriend was lying on the sidewalk having [[convulsions]].

River starred as a young boy who discovers he has [[dyslexia]]. Joaquin starred in a small role alongside his brother. In September, the pilot episode of the short-lived TV series ''[[It's Your Move]]'' aired. Phoenix was cast as Brian and only had one line of dialogue. He also starred as [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy's]] son, [[Robert Kennedy, Jr.]], in the TV movie ''[[Robert Kennedy and His Times]]''. After his role in ''Dyslexia'' was critically acclaimed, Phoenix was almost immediately cast as a major role in his next made-for-TV movie, ''[[Surviving: A Family in Crisis]]''. He starred as Philip Brogan alongside [[Molly Ringwald]] and [[Heather O'Rourke]]. Halfway during the filming of ''Surviving'', Iris Burton contacted him about a possible role in the film ''[[Explorers (film)|Explorers]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.river-phoenix.org/tv/surviving/ |title=Rio's Attic \u2013 Phoenix TV |publisher=River-phoenix.org |date= |accessdate=August 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1984, Phoenix secured the role of geeky boy-scientist Wolfgang M\u00fcller in [[Joe Dante]]'s large-budget science-fiction film ''Explorers'' alongside [[Ethan Hawke]], and production began soon after. Released in the summer of 1985, this was Phoenix's first major motion picture role. In October 1986, Phoenix co-starred alongside [[Tuesday Weld]] and [[Geraldine Fitzgerald]] in the acclaimed [[CBS]] television movie ''[[Circle of Violence: A Family Drama]]'', which told a story of domestic [[elder abuse]]. This was Phoenix's last television role before achieving film stardom.\n\n===1986\u20131993: Critical success in ''Stand By Me'', ''Running on Empty'', ''My Own Private Idaho''===\nAt 15, Phoenix had a significant role in [[Rob Reiner]]'s popular coming-of-age film ''[[Stand by Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'' (1986), which made him a household name. ''[[The Washington Post]]'' opined that Phoenix gave the film its \"centre of gravity\".<ref name=\"The Independent\"/> Phoenix commented: \"The truth is, I identified so much with the role of Chris Chambers that if I hadn't had my family to go back to after the shoot, I'd have probably had to see a psychiatrist.\"<ref name=Tribune/> Later that year Phoenix completed [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'' (1986), playing the son of [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Helen Mirren]]'s characters. \"He was obviously going to be a movie star,\" observed Weir. \"It's something apart from acting ability.

During this time, the Phoenix family continued to move on a regular basis, moving over forty times by the time Phoenix was 18.

In 1991, Phoenix filmed an acclaimed independent picture called ''[[Dogfight (film)|Dogfight]]'' co-starring [[Lili Taylor]] and directed by [[Nancy Savoca]]. In the romantic coming-of-age drama set in San Francisco, Phoenix portrayed a young U.S. Marine on the night before he was shipped off to Vietnam in November 1963. Taylor remarked that Phoenix suffered because he could not distance himself from his character: \"He also hadn't gotten into any [drugs]&nbsp;\u2013 he was just drinking then, too. It was different ... That was actually a hard part for him, because it was so radically different from who he was. He was such a hippie, and here he was playing this marine.

In his review for ''[[Newsweek]]'', David Ansen praised Phoenix's performance: \"The campfire scene in which Mike awkwardly declares his unrequited love for Scott is a marvel of delicacy. In this, and every scene, Phoenix immerses himself so deeply inside his character you almost forget you've seen him before: it's a stunningly sensitive performance, poignant and comic at once\". \n\nFor his role in ''My Own Private Idaho'', Phoenix won Best Actor honors at the [[Venice Film Festival]], the [[National Society of Film Critics]] and the [[Independent Spirit Awards]]. The film and its success solidified Phoenix's image as an actor with edgy, leading man potential. In that period Phoenix was beginning to use [[marijuana]], [[cocaine]] and heroin with some friends.<ref name=\"people\"/><ref name=\"High Life\">{{cite journal|last1=Schindehette|first1=Susan|last2=Stambler|first2=Lyndon|last3=Dodd|first3=Johnny|last4=Benet|first4=Lorenzo|last5=Stone|first5=Joanna|title=High Life|journal=People|date=January 17, 1994|volume=41|issue=2|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20107312,00.html|accessdate=July 4, 2014}}</ref> \n\nIn the book Gus Van Sant wrote about Phoenix, ''Pink'', the director said clearly that Phoenix was not a regular drug user but only an occasional one, and that the actor had a more serious problem with alcohol. Phoenix had always tried to hide his addictions because he feared that they might ruin his career as they did his relationship with Martha Plimpton.\n\nPhoenix teamed up with [[Robert Redford]] and again with Sidney Poitier for the conspiracy/espionage thriller ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' (1992). A month later he began production on [[Sam Shepard]]'s art-house ghost western ''[[Silent Tongue]]'' (which was released in 1994); he also was beaten out for the role of Paul by [[Brad Pitt]] in ''[[A River Runs Through It (film)|A River Runs Through It]]''. He made a cameo appearance in Van Sant's ''[[Even Cowgirls Get the Blues (film)|Even Cowgirls get the Blues]]'' (1993), co-starring his sister Rain. Phoenix then starred in [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s country music-themed film, ''[[The Thing Called Love]]'' (1993), the last completed picture before his death. Phoenix began a relationship with co-star [[Samantha Mathis]] on the set.\n\n==Music==\n[[File:Aleka's Attic.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|Phoenix (middle) with Aleka's Attic.]]\n[[File:AlekasPixRivSkysYellowGuitar1.jpg|thumb|upright|Phoenix in 1991 playing with Aleka's Attic at [[The Cubby Bear]].]]\nAlthough Phoenix's movie career was generating most of the income for his family, it has been stated by close friends and relatives that his true passion was music. Phoenix was a singer, songwriter, and an accomplished guitarist. He had begun teaching himself guitar at the age of five and had stated in an interview for ''E!'' in 1988 that his family's move to Los Angeles when he was nine was made so that he and his sister \"could become recording artists. I fell into commercials for financial reasons and acting became an attractive concept\".  Prior to securing an acting agent, Phoenix and his siblings tried to forge a career in music by playing cover versions on the streets of the Westwood district of LA, often being moved along by police because gathering crowds would obstruct the pavement. From the first fruits of his film success, Phoenix saved $650 to obtain his prized possession, a guitar with which he wrote what he described as \"progressive, ethereal folk-rock\".<ref name=Tribune/>\n\nWhile working on ''[[A Night in the Life of Jimmy Reardon]]'' in 1986, Phoenix had written and recorded a song, \"Heart to Get\", specifically for the end credits of the movie. 20th Century Fox cut it from the completed film, but director William Richert put it back into place for his director's cut some years later. It was during filming that Phoenix met [[Chris Blackwell]] of [[Island Records]]; this meeting would later secure Phoenix a two-year development deal with the label. Phoenix disliked the idea of being a solo artist and relished collaboration; therefore he focused on putting together a band. [[Aleka's Attic]] were formed in 1987 and the lineup included his sister Rain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3209145.stm|title=Entertainment: A decade without River Phoenix|work=BBC News|date=October 31, 2003|accessdate=August 24, 2010}}</ref>\n\nPhoenix was committed to gaining credibility by his own merit and maintained that the band would not use his name when securing performances that were not benefits for charitable organizations. Phoenix's first release was \"Across the Way\", co-written with bandmate Josh McKay, which was released in 1989 on a benefit album for [[PETA]] titled ''Tame Yourself''.<ref>{{cite book|title=They Died Too Young: The Brief Lives and Tragic Deaths of the Mega-Star Legends of Our Times|year=1996|publisher=Smithmark Pub|isbn=0-765-19600-X|page=76|editor=Hall, Tony}}</ref> In 1991, Phoenix wrote and recorded a spoken word piece called \"Curi Curi\" for [[Milton Nascimento]]'s album ''TXAI''.<ref>{{cite book|title=All Music Guide: The Definitive Guide to Popular Music|year=2001|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|isbn=0-879-30627-0|page=[https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd/page/920 920]|editor1=Bogdanov, Vladimir|editor2=Woodstra, Chris|editor3=Erlewine, Stephen Thomas|url=https://archive.org/details/allmusicguidedef00bogd/page/920}}</ref> Also in 1991 the Aleka's Attic track \"Too Many Colors\" was used in the film ''[[My Own Private Idaho]]'', which included Phoenix in a starring role.\n\nAleka's Attic disbanded in 1992, but Phoenix continued writing and performing. While working on the film ''[[The Thing Called Love]]'' in 1993, Phoenix wrote and recorded the song \"[[Lone Star State of Mine]]\", which he performs in the movie. The song was not included on the film's soundtrack album. In 1996, the Aleka's Attic track \"Note to a Friend\" was released on the 1996 benefit album ''In Defense of Animals; Volume II'' and featured Flea of [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] on bass. Phoenix had collaborated with friend [[John Frusciante]] after his first departure from [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] and the songs \"Height Down\" and \"Well I've Been\" were released on Frusciante's second solo album ''[[Smile from the Streets You Hold]]'' in 1997. Phoenix was an investor in the original [[House of Blues]] (founded by his good friend and ''[[Sneakers (1992 film)|Sneakers]]'' co-star [[Dan Aykroyd]]) in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], which opened its doors to the public after serving a group of homeless people on Thanksgiving Day 1992.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9y9KAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YIUMAAAAIBAJ&pg=3101,4159902&dq=river-phoenix+house-of-blues&hl=en |title=The Vindicator \u2013 Google News Archive Search |publisher= |date= |accessdate=December 21, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Activism==\nPhoenix was a dedicated [[animal rights]], [[Environmental movement|environmental]] and political activist.

Forrest said that in the days leading up to his death, Phoenix was staying with [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]] guitarist [[John Frusciante]]. The two would do large amounts of drugs together, embarking on huge binges, and barely if ever slept. He said the drug routine was consistent for all of them, as he was there doing drugs with them. First they would smoke [[crack cocaine|crack]] or inject cocaine intravenously, then inject heroin.\n\nOn the evening of October 30, 1993, Phoenix was to perform with the band [[P (group)|P]] which featured his good friends [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] from the Red Hot Chili Peppers, actor [[Johnny Depp]], [[Gibby Haynes]] of the [[Butthole Surfers]] along with [[Al Jourgensen]] of [[Ministry (band)|Ministry]] at [[The Viper Room]], a Hollywood nightclub partly owned at the time by Depp.<ref name=\"High Life\" /> Forrest claims that Phoenix and Frusciante arrived at the club together where they would meet up with Phoenix's girlfriend [[Samantha Mathis]], Phoenix's brother [[Joaquin Phoenix|Joaquin]], and their sister [[Rain Phoenix|Rain]], along with Flea and Depp. After arriving, cocaine was immediately passed around. Forrest later said that Phoenix was obviously already high and was, as he put it, \"unsteady as a boxer who had taken one too many head-shots during a fifteen-round bout.\"\n\nDuring the performance by P, Forrest said that Phoenix tapped him on the shoulder to tell him he was not feeling well, and that he thought he had overdosed. Forrest said to Phoenix that he didn't think that he was overdosing because he could stand and talk. Nonetheless, he offered to take Phoenix home, but Phoenix declined, saying he was feeling better. A few moments later, Forrest said that a commotion erupted in the club and he went outside to find Mathis screaming as her boyfriend was lying on the sidewalk having [[convulsions]]. Joaquin called [[9-1-1]], but was unable to determine whether Phoenix was breathing.

The station opened on 1 July 1856, is located on the [[Arnhem-Oberhausen railway]]. The train services are operated by [[Deutsche Bahn]] and [[Abellio Deutschland]].\n\nIn 1888 the station building from [[K\u00f6ln]]-Kalk was transferred to Sterkrade.<ref>Lindemann p.25</ref> This building was badly damaged during the Second World War, so that a new building had to be erected. This was opened in 1952.<ref>Lindemann p.56</ref> It is currently owned by a private investor.\n\n== Location and layout ==\nOberhausen-Sterkrade station is on the [[Duisburg-Ruhrort\u2013Dortmund railway]] (line 2206, [[Wanne-Eickel Hauptbahnhof]]&nbsp;\u2013 Oberhausen-Sterkrade) and the [[Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway]] (line 2270, [[Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof]]&nbsp;\u2013 Emmerich border \u2013 [[Arnhem Centraal railway station|Arnhem]]). The neighbouring stations to the south are Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof (line 2270) and [[Oberhausen-Osterfeld station|Oberhausen-Osterfeld]] (line 2206), while [[Oberhausen-Holten station]] is the next station to the north.\n \nThe station has six mainline tracks that run approximately in a south-north direction. Platform track 1 (to Emmerich) and 2 (from Emmerich) are the continuous mainline platform tracks. Track 3 serves as a passing track. Track 4 is used for traffic to the Oxea factory. Tracks 8 and 9 on the east side are used for parking trains, while a former siding to the GHH wheelset factory is no longer used. The entrance building is located east of platform&nbsp;1. The station is equipped with a platform next to the station building on track&nbsp;1 (172&nbsp;metres long) and an island platform between tracks&nbsp;2 and 3 (222&nbsp;metres long). The platforms are 38&nbsp;centimetres high with the exception of a short, raised area on platform&nbsp;1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deutschebahn.com/de/geschaefte/infrastruktur/bahnhof/bahnsteige_uebersicht/2235752/bahnsteige_details.html?start=0&rid=4651&c2235748=Oberhausen-Sterkrade&itemsPerPage=20&x=1 |title=Bahnsteiginformationen, Station Oberhausen-Sterkrade |publisher=Deutsche Bahn AG |date=23 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223209/http://www.deutschebahn.com/de/geschaefte/infrastruktur/bahnhof/bahnsteige_uebersicht/2235752/bahnsteige_details.html?start=0&rid=4651&c2235748=Oberhausen-Sterkrade&itemsPerPage=20&x=1 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2 April 2020|language=de}}</ref> Within the station precinct, Rosastra\u00dfe crosses the tracks to the south over a level crossing.\n \nThe station has two exits: the western one leads to the park-and-ride car park on ''Neum\u00fchler Stra\u00dfe'' in the Schwarze Heide district and the eastern one leads directly to the centre of Sterkrad. The exits can be reached via short ramps next to the stairs, but the island platform can only be reached by stairs so the station is not barrier-free.\n\n== History==\n[[File:Bahnhof Oberhausen-Sterkrade 07 Bahnsteige.JPG|thumb|left|Platforms in Oberhausen-Sterkrade, 2015]]\nThe station was opened with the [[Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof|Oberhausen]]\u2013[[Dinslaken station|Dinslaken]] section of the Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem line on 1&nbsp;July 1856.<ref name=\"operations\">{{cite web|first=Andr\u00e9 |last=Joost |url=http://nrwbahnarchiv.bplaced.net/esn/EOSD.htm |title= Oberhausen-Sterkrade station operations|work=NRW rail archive |language=de | accessdate= 2 April 2020}}</ref> It was built and operated by the [[Cologne-Minden Railway Company]] (''C\u00f6ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'', CME), which was nationalised in 1880.

It was initially used only by freight trains, but passenger trains also ran on it from 1&nbsp;July 1874.

Two new tracks will be built along the existing line to the south of the station and the connecting curve to Oberhausen-Osterfeld is to be upgraded to include two tracks for freight traffic. The freight tracks are to run to the north of the station. The Rosastra\u00dfe [[level crossing]] is to be replaced by an overpass.

The station opened on 1 July 1856, is located on the [[Arnhem-Oberhausen railway]]. The train services are operated by [[Deutsche Bahn]] and [[Abellio Deutschland]].\n\nIn 1888 the station building from [[K\u00f6ln]]-Kalk was transferred to Sterkrade.<ref>Lindemann p.25</ref> This building was badly damaged during the Second World War, so that a new building had to be erected. This was opened in 1952.<ref>Lindemann p.56</ref> It is currently owned by a private investor.\n\n== Location and layout ==\nOberhausen-Sterkrade station is on the [[Duisburg-Ruhrort\u2013Dortmund railway]] (line 2206, [[Wanne-Eickel Hauptbahnhof]]&nbsp;\u2013 Oberhausen-Sterkrade) and the [[Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem railway]] (line 2270, [[Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof]]&nbsp;\u2013 Emmerich border \u2013 [[Arnhem Centraal railway station|Arnhem]]). The neighbouring stations to the south are Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof (line 2270) and [[Oberhausen-Osterfeld station|Oberhausen-Osterfeld]] (line 2206), while [[Oberhausen-Holten station]] is the next station to the north.\n \nThe station has six mainline tracks that run approximately in a south-north direction. Platform track 1 (to Emmerich) and 2 (from Emmerich) are the continuous mainline platform tracks. Track 3 serves as a passing track. Track 4 is used for traffic to the Oxea factory. Tracks 8 and 9 on the east side are used for parking trains, while a former siding to the GHH wheelset factory is no longer used. The entrance building is located east of platform&nbsp;1. The station is equipped with a platform next to the station building on track&nbsp;1 (172&nbsp;metres long) and an island platform between tracks&nbsp;2 and 3 (222&nbsp;metres long). The platforms are 38&nbsp;centimetres high with the exception of a short, raised area on platform&nbsp;1.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deutschebahn.com/de/geschaefte/infrastruktur/bahnhof/bahnsteige_uebersicht/2235752/bahnsteige_details.html?start=0&rid=4651&c2235748=Oberhausen-Sterkrade&itemsPerPage=20&x=1 |title=Bahnsteiginformationen, Station Oberhausen-Sterkrade |publisher=Deutsche Bahn AG |date=23 September 2015 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923223209/http://www.deutschebahn.com/de/geschaefte/infrastruktur/bahnhof/bahnsteige_uebersicht/2235752/bahnsteige_details.html?start=0&rid=4651&c2235748=Oberhausen-Sterkrade&itemsPerPage=20&x=1 |archive-date=23 September 2015 |url-status=dead |accessdate=2 April 2020|language=de}}</ref> Within the station precinct, Rosastra\u00dfe crosses the tracks to the south over a level crossing.\n \nThe station has two exits: the western one leads to the park-and-ride car park on ''Neum\u00fchler Stra\u00dfe'' in the Schwarze Heide district and the eastern one leads directly to the centre of Sterkrad. The exits can be reached via short ramps next to the stairs, but the island platform can only be reached by stairs so the station is not barrier-free.\n\n== History==\n[[File:Bahnhof Oberhausen-Sterkrade 07 Bahnsteige.JPG|thumb|left|Platforms in Oberhausen-Sterkrade, 2015]]\nThe station was opened with the [[Oberhausen Hauptbahnhof|Oberhausen]]\u2013[[Dinslaken station|Dinslaken]] section of the Oberhausen\u2013Arnhem line on 1&nbsp;July 1856.<ref name=\"operations\">{{cite web|first=Andr\u00e9 |last=Joost |url=http://nrwbahnarchiv.bplaced.net/esn/EOSD.htm |title= Oberhausen-Sterkrade station operations|work=NRW rail archive |language=de | accessdate= 2 April 2020}}</ref> It was built and operated by the [[Cologne-Minden Railway Company]] (''C\u00f6ln-Mindener Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft'', CME), which was nationalised in 1880.

[[Nadar climber]]s were the largest subsect of today's Nadar community. A few subsects of the Nadar community, such as the [[Nadan (Nadar subcaste)|Nelamaikkarar]]s, were traditionally wealthy landlords and money lenders. Historically, most Nadars were cultivators of [[Borassus|palmyra trees]] and [[jaggery]] and a few were also involved in the [[Palm wine|toddy]] trade. Nadar climbers had faced discrimination from major upper castes in some regions.

Like their Tirunelveli counterparts, the Nadars of Travancore were mostly palmyra climbers. However, a significant number of Nadars were subtenants to [[Nair]] or Vellalar landlords. These aristocratic Nadars called themselves Nadans and some of them had direct control over their lands. The Nadans enjoyed special privileges under the Raja and claimed that they were superior to the climbers. The climbers of Travancore fared a little better than their Tirunelveli counterparts, but suffered severe social disabilities not found in Tirunelveli due to Travancore's rigid [[Caste system in Kerala|caste hierarchy]]. As [[Swami Vivekananda]] stated, the Keralite hierarchy was a lunatic asylum of castes. One example of the social disabilities was that Nadar climber women were not allowed to cover their bosoms, as most of the non- Brahmin women of Kerala, to punctuate their low status. However, the Nadan women of the region were exempted from this restriction.<ref name=\"Hardgrave13\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=55\u201370}}</ref>  \n   \nDiscontented with their social status, a large number of Nadar climbers embraced Christianity and became upwardly mobile. Although they improved their status with the aid of Christian missionaries, the outcome of their conversion did not conform to the intent of those missionaries. Both the Christian and Hindu Nadar climber women wore the upper jacket in the manner of upper-class women and also their Tamil counterparts, in order to improve their social status. In turn, upper-class men abused and discriminated against them. One Nadan family of [[Agastheeswaram]], instead of supporting their depressed counterparts, supported the upper-class men and claimed that only their women had the right to wear an upper cloth. The situation became known as the [[Upper cloth controversy]] and became violent. Eventually, with assistance from the Travancore authorities, British Christian Missionaries and [[Vaikunta Swamy]], the depressed Nadar climber women won the right to wear their upper cloth in the manner of their Nadan counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardgrave13\"/><ref>{{cite book | title=Mixed messages: materiality, textuality, missions| edition=| author=Jamie S.

Over time they  became commercially skilled and by the late 19th century were socially aspirant. [[Mercantilism]] played a crucial role in facilitating their upward mobility but religion was also perceived as a vehicle. Around 10 percent of the community converted to Christianity, both [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]].<ref name=\"Clothey\">{{cite book|last=Clothey|first=Fred W.|title=Ritualizing on the boundaries: continuity and innovation in the Tamil diaspora|publisher=University of South Carolina press|year=2006|pages=88\u201390|isbn=978-1-57003-647-7|oclc=255232421|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRxAOJWnyEwC&lpg=PA89|accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref>  \n   \nBritish rule in the southern districts introduced new opportunities for trade and commerce, of which the Nadars took advantage. They established sophisticated ''pettais'' (fortified compounds) and ''urvinmurais'' (local caste associations) to ensure safety for their goods. Members of the ''uravinmurai'', who were known as ''muraikkarars'', would contribute a portion of their income to the association as ''mahimai'' (literally, to glorify oneself), in order to use the facilities of the ''pettais'' and to improve the common good. As the wealth of the Northern Nadars increased they began also to adopt the customs of the [[Kshatriya|North Indian Kshatriyas]] in order to improve their social status, in a process now known as [[Sanskritisation]]. Many tried to disassociate themselves from their Nadar climber counterparts and the term Shanar (the term generally used to call a Tamil palmrya climber). They adopted the title of ''Nadan'', previously used only by the Nelamaikkarars.  \nTo demonstrate their wealthy and powerful social position, the Nadars of Sivakasi hired [[Maravar (caste)|Maravar]] palanquin bearers.<ref name=\"Hardgrave14\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=95\u2013109}}</ref>  \n   \nThe upward mobility and kshatriya pretensions of the Nadars of the six towns of Ramanad caused resentment among both the  Vellalar and the Maravar castes, who were ritually ranked above the Nadars.<ref name=\"Mandelbaum1\">{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1970|pp=511}}</ref> The outcome was a series of caste conflicts, including the [[Sivakasi riots of 1899]]. However, the Sankritisation movement was a failure initially and the Nadar climbers, who lived as minorities, were still discriminated by the majority castes. However these confrontations aided the community to protest for the required rights and privileges, with integrity, and also test how much other communities were willing to accept the Nadar claims of high status. The Northern Nadar leaders then sought to unite their community by encouraging intermarriages within the five major Nadar subcastes and also uplift the depressed palmrya Nadar climbers. They also sought to maintain amiable relationships with other communities. This led to the formation of the Nadar Mahajana Sangam in 1910.<ref name=\"Hardgrave15\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=109\u2013129}}</ref>  \n   \n===Sri Lanka===  \nSome Nadars emigrated from South India to Sri Lanka during the British colonial era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2011/05/01/imp06.asp|title=Sri Lankan Nadars born with business flair|date=1 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Plantation Tamils of Ceylon|page=6|last=Peebles|first=Patrick|publisher=Continuum}}</ref><ref>\"Seventeenth century Tamilaham as gleaned from Jesuit letters\", by M.

With the rise of the politically ambitious [[T. Rattinasami Nadar]], a wealthy Nadar of Porayar in [[Thanjavur]] district, a new association was formed.<ref name=\"Lucy Carroll\">{{cite journal | title=Colonial Perceptions of Indian Society and the Emergence of Caste(s) Associations| last=Carroll| first=Lucy| journal=The Journal of Asian Studies| date=February 1978| volume=37 |issue=2 | pages=234\u2013235 | doi=10.2307/2054164| jstor=2054164}}</ref>  This resulted from Rattinasami Nadar inviting prominent community leaders to attend a plenary session in February 1910, with the intent of establishing an organization to represent the entire community. Rattinasami Nadar's uncle, V. Ponnusami Nadar, was elected to become the first president of the association, which was called the [[Nadar Mahajana Sangam]]. The association was open to any Nadar male of any subcaste or religion, and had as its general purpose the upliftment of the community. The early Sangam conferences were dominated by the Northern Nadars.<ref name=\"Hardgrave16\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=130\u2013132}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=India's silent revolution: the rise of the lower castes in North India| edition=| last=Jaffrelot| first=Christophe| year=2003| pages=167| publisher=Columbia University Press| isbn=0-231-12786-3}}</ref>  \n   \n===Against toddy===  \nThe campaign against toddy was one of the first steps taken by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam to enhance the social advancement of the entire Nadar community. Though majority of the Nadar climbers were engaged in the production of jaggery, a significant number of Nadar climbers were also involved in the production of toddy. The Sangam urged the Nadar climbers to abandon their traditional occupation of toddy tapping and not to sell hard toddy. However many Nadar climbers were reluctant to give up their profitable occupation. The situation got out of hand when Nadar leaders tried to intimidate the climbers, by using tenets of their cult, to give up their occupation as toddy tappers. To ease the situation the district magistrate issued a proclamation restricting the climbers to sell hard toddy only in specific regions, where toddy can be legally drawn. However the Sangam's campaign was effective for only about a year.<ref name=\"Hardgrave17\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=136\u2013138}}</ref>  \n   \n===Prohibition of toddy act===  \nThe Sangam then in order to aid the climbers, sought to abolish the tax levied on palmyra trees. After the establishment of the Prohibition (of toddy) act in the Northern districts of Madras Presidency, the Nadar Mahajana Sangam along with its sister association, Dakshina Mara Nadar Sangam of Tirunelveli, sought to remove it to aid the depressed climbers. The British advisor government in turn suspended the act. However, the prohibition act was reintroduced after the independence. Under the rules of the act, the climbers could only tap between 4 am to 2pm and sell sweet toddy between 6am and 2pm. These procedures can also only be practiced by climbers who have license. The rigid government rules pressurized the depressed climbers. The two prominent Nadars Sangams constantly pressurized the government and eventually the enforcement of these regulations gradually eased. By the mid-1950s, the government assigned cooperative societies to promote jaggery production.<ref name=\"Hardgrave18\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=138\u2013140}}</ref>  \n   \n===Nadar educational institutions===  \nThe Nadar community did not completely rely on the Backward Class Commission for educational advancement. In 1885, the Northern Nadars established the Kshatriya Vidhyasala High School in Virudhunagar by using the ''mahimai'' funds from the Nadar ''uravinmurai''. Education was also the primary concern of the Nadar Mahajana Sangam from inception. In 1921, the Sangam began to provide scholarship loans to needy students, and by 1964 more than 3000 such loans were offered. Some students were given assistance for foreign studies. The Sangam also aided the establishment of village schools. Education formed the largest portion of expenditure by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam.{{when|date=January 2012}} The [[Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank|Nadar bank]] along with other cooperative societies gave 5 percent of their profit to the scholarship fund. The Nadar Mahajana Sangam also established a college, Senthilkumara Nadar College, in 1947.<ref name=\"Hardgrave19\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=145\u2013146}}</ref>  \n   \n===Resolution of inter-caste conflicts===  \nIn villages where there were few Nadar climbers, they  were oppressed by those in the majority. The Nadar Mahajana Sangam acted in the interests of such climbers, using the strength and influence of the community at large. The climbers could ask the Sangam to intervene in inter-community issues, which would cause the Sangam to investigate the situation and determine the validity of any Nadar claims. Then, if necessary, the Sangam would request police intervention or support a claim in court. In situations where the matter went to court, the Sangam would not provide financial support for the Nadar claimant to contest the case, but would rather see that the claim is properly heard. After [[independence of India]], the Sangam took advantage of the constitutional provisions encouraging a caste-less society and also supported government attempts to promote this vision. The support included urging their own community members to allow use of their schools, tanks, temples and wells by other communities. The name of the Nadar bank was changed to [[Tamilnad Mercantile Bank]]. These activities earned the Nadar community respect and recognition.<ref name=\"Hardgrave20\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=159\u2013162}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Transforming societies, transforming anthropology| edition=| author=Emilio F.

These include procedures relating to birth, adulthood, marriage and death. Every Hindu Nadar belongs to a ''kuttam'' (assemblage) through patrilineal descent, and each ''kuttam'' has a common family deity. During migration, families would often take soil from their family temple and enshrine it at their new home. Traditionally, all the members of a ''kuttam'' would assemble at least once a year at the family temple. With the birth of a child, the family would traditionally go to the family deity temple, where the hair of the child is shaved for the first time and offered to the deity. At the time of marriage the first invitation is presented to the family deity.<ref name=\"Hardgrave26\"/>  \n   \nThe Hindu Nadars are almost entirely [[Saivite]] (only one ''kuttam'' is [[Vaishnavite]]). Of the deities, [[Murugan]] has been widely popular among the Nadars. Goddess [[Bhadrakali]] is the tutelary deity of the Nadar community. The Nadars also claim that they are the descendants of Bhadrakali.

[[Nadar climber]]s were the largest subsect of today's Nadar community. A few subsects of the Nadar community, such as the [[Nadan (Nadar subcaste)|Nelamaikkarar]]s, were traditionally wealthy landlords and money lenders. Historically, most Nadars were cultivators of [[Borassus|palmyra trees]] and [[jaggery]] and a few were also involved in the [[Palm wine|toddy]] trade.

Like their Tirunelveli counterparts, the Nadars of Travancore were mostly palmyra climbers. However, a significant number of Nadars were subtenants to [[Nair]] or Vellalar landlords. These aristocratic Nadars called themselves Nadans and some of them had direct control over their lands. The Nadans enjoyed special privileges under the Raja and claimed that they were superior to the climbers. The climbers of Travancore fared a little better than their Tirunelveli counterparts, but suffered severe social disabilities not found in Tirunelveli due to Travancore's rigid [[Caste system in Kerala|caste hierarchy]]. As [[Swami Vivekananda]] stated, the Keralite hierarchy was a lunatic asylum of castes. One example of the social disabilities was that Nadar climber women were not allowed to cover their bosoms, as most of the non- Brahmin women of Kerala, to punctuate their low status. However, the Nadan women of the region were exempted from this restriction.<ref name=\"Hardgrave13\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=55\u201370}}</ref>  \n   \nDiscontented with their social status, a large number of Nadar climbers embraced Christianity and became upwardly mobile. Although they improved their status with the aid of Christian missionaries, the outcome of their conversion did not conform to the intent of those missionaries. Both the Christian and Hindu Nadar climber women wore the upper jacket in the manner of upper-class women and also their Tamil counterparts, in order to improve their social status. In turn, upper-class men abused and discriminated against them. One Nadan family of [[Agastheeswaram]], instead of supporting their depressed counterparts, supported the upper-class men and claimed that only their women had the right to wear an upper cloth. The situation became known as the [[Upper cloth controversy]] and became violent. Eventually, with assistance from the Travancore authorities, British Christian Missionaries and [[Vaikunta Swamy]], the depressed Nadar climber women won the right to wear their upper cloth in the manner of their Nadan counterparts.<ref name=\"Hardgrave13\"/><ref>{{cite book | title=Mixed messages: materiality, textuality, missions| edition=| author=Jamie S. Scott, Gareth Griffiths| year=2005| pages=75| publisher=[[Palgrave Macmillan]]| isbn=0-312-29576-6}}</ref>  \n   \n===Northern Nadars===  \nSome petty Nadar traders  migrated from southern Tirunelveli to northern Tirunelveli and Virudhunagar. Over time they  became commercially skilled and by the late 19th century were socially aspirant. [[Mercantilism]] played a crucial role in facilitating their upward mobility but religion was also perceived as a vehicle. Around 10 percent of the community converted to Christianity, both [[Catholic]] and [[Protestant]].<ref name=\"Clothey\">{{cite book|last=Clothey|first=Fred W.|title=Ritualizing on the boundaries: continuity and innovation in the Tamil diaspora|publisher=University of South Carolina press|year=2006|pages=88\u201390|isbn=978-1-57003-647-7|oclc=255232421|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uRxAOJWnyEwC&lpg=PA89|accessdate=2009-11-08}}</ref>  \n   \nBritish rule in the southern districts introduced new opportunities for trade and commerce, of which the Nadars took advantage. They established sophisticated ''pettais'' (fortified compounds) and ''urvinmurais'' (local caste associations) to ensure safety for their goods. Members of the ''uravinmurai'', who were known as ''muraikkarars'', would contribute a portion of their income to the association as ''mahimai'' (literally, to glorify oneself), in order to use the facilities of the ''pettais'' and to improve the common good. As the wealth of the Northern Nadars increased they began also to adopt the customs of the [[Kshatriya|North Indian Kshatriyas]] in order to improve their social status, in a process now known as [[Sanskritisation]]. Many tried to disassociate themselves from their Nadar climber counterparts and the term Shanar (the term generally used to call a Tamil palmrya climber). They adopted the title of ''Nadan'', previously used only by the Nelamaikkarars.  \nTo demonstrate their wealthy and powerful social position, the Nadars of Sivakasi hired [[Maravar (caste)|Maravar]] palanquin bearers.<ref name=\"Hardgrave14\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=95\u2013109}}</ref>  \n   \nThe upward mobility and kshatriya pretensions of the Nadars of the six towns of Ramanad caused resentment among both the  Vellalar and the Maravar castes, who were ritually ranked above the Nadars.<ref name=\"Mandelbaum1\">{{Harvnb|Mandelbaum|1970|pp=511}}</ref> The outcome was a series of caste conflicts, including the [[Sivakasi riots of 1899]]. However, the Sankritisation movement was a failure initially and the Nadar climbers, who lived as minorities, were still discriminated by the majority castes. However these confrontations aided the community to protest for the required rights and privileges, with integrity, and also test how much other communities were willing to accept the Nadar claims of high status. The Northern Nadar leaders then sought to unite their community by encouraging intermarriages within the five major Nadar subcastes and also uplift the depressed palmrya Nadar climbers. They also sought to maintain amiable relationships with other communities. This led to the formation of the Nadar Mahajana Sangam in 1910.<ref name=\"Hardgrave15\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=109\u2013129}}</ref>  \n   \n===Sri Lanka===  \nSome Nadars emigrated from South India to Sri Lanka during the British colonial era.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2011/05/01/imp06.asp|title=Sri Lankan Nadars born with business flair|date=1 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=The Plantation Tamils of Ceylon|page=6|last=Peebles|first=Patrick|publisher=Continuum}}</ref><ref>\"Seventeenth century Tamilaham as gleaned from Jesuit letters\", by M.

Rattinasami Nadar]], founder of the Nadar Mahajana Sangam]]  \n   \n===Nadar Mahajana Sangam===  \nThe separate Nadar associations of the six Ramanad towns were unable to support a community that was becoming more dispersed as many began to migrate to other parts of [[Madras Presidency]]. With the rise of the politically ambitious [[T. Rattinasami Nadar]], a wealthy Nadar of Porayar in [[Thanjavur]] district, a new association was formed.<ref name=\"Lucy Carroll\">{{cite journal | title=Colonial Perceptions of Indian Society and the Emergence of Caste(s) Associations| last=Carroll| first=Lucy| journal=The Journal of Asian Studies| date=February 1978| volume=37 |issue=2 | pages=234\u2013235 | doi=10.2307/2054164| jstor=2054164}}</ref>  This resulted from Rattinasami Nadar inviting prominent community leaders to attend a plenary session in February 1910, with the intent of establishing an organization to represent the entire community. Rattinasami Nadar's uncle, V. Ponnusami Nadar, was elected to become the first president of the association, which was called the [[Nadar Mahajana Sangam]]. The association was open to any Nadar male of any subcaste or religion, and had as its general purpose the upliftment of the community. The early Sangam conferences were dominated by the Northern Nadars.<ref name=\"Hardgrave16\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=130\u2013132}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | title=India's silent revolution: the rise of the lower castes in North India| edition=| last=Jaffrelot| first=Christophe| year=2003| pages=167| publisher=Columbia University Press| isbn=0-231-12786-3}}</ref>  \n   \n===Against toddy===  \nThe campaign against toddy was one of the first steps taken by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam to enhance the social advancement of the entire Nadar community. Though majority of the Nadar climbers were engaged in the production of jaggery, a significant number of Nadar climbers were also involved in the production of toddy. The Sangam urged the Nadar climbers to abandon their traditional occupation of toddy tapping and not to sell hard toddy. However many Nadar climbers were reluctant to give up their profitable occupation. The situation got out of hand when Nadar leaders tried to intimidate the climbers, by using tenets of their cult, to give up their occupation as toddy tappers. To ease the situation the district magistrate issued a proclamation restricting the climbers to sell hard toddy only in specific regions, where toddy can be legally drawn. However the Sangam's campaign was effective for only about a year.<ref name=\"Hardgrave17\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=136\u2013138}}</ref>  \n   \n===Prohibition of toddy act===  \nThe Sangam then in order to aid the climbers, sought to abolish the tax levied on palmyra trees. After the establishment of the Prohibition (of toddy) act in the Northern districts of Madras Presidency, the Nadar Mahajana Sangam along with its sister association, Dakshina Mara Nadar Sangam of Tirunelveli, sought to remove it to aid the depressed climbers. The British advisor government in turn suspended the act. However, the prohibition act was reintroduced after the independence. Under the rules of the act, the climbers could only tap between 4 am to 2pm and sell sweet toddy between 6am and 2pm. These procedures can also only be practiced by climbers who have license. The rigid government rules pressurized the depressed climbers. The two prominent Nadars Sangams constantly pressurized the government and eventually the enforcement of these regulations gradually eased. By the mid-1950s, the government assigned cooperative societies to promote jaggery production.<ref name=\"Hardgrave18\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=138\u2013140}}</ref>  \n   \n===Nadar educational institutions===  \nThe Nadar community did not completely rely on the Backward Class Commission for educational advancement. In 1885, the Northern Nadars established the Kshatriya Vidhyasala High School in Virudhunagar by using the ''mahimai'' funds from the Nadar ''uravinmurai''. Education was also the primary concern of the Nadar Mahajana Sangam from inception. In 1921, the Sangam began to provide scholarship loans to needy students, and by 1964 more than 3000 such loans were offered. Some students were given assistance for foreign studies. The Sangam also aided the establishment of village schools. Education formed the largest portion of expenditure by the Nadar Mahajana Sangam.{{when|date=January 2012}} The [[Tamil Nadu Mercantile Bank|Nadar bank]] along with other cooperative societies gave 5 percent of their profit to the scholarship fund. The Nadar Mahajana Sangam also established a college, Senthilkumara Nadar College, in 1947.<ref name=\"Hardgrave19\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=145\u2013146}}</ref>  \n   \n===Resolution of inter-caste conflicts===  \nIn villages where there were few Nadar climbers, they  were oppressed by those in the majority. The Nadar Mahajana Sangam acted in the interests of such climbers, using the strength and influence of the community at large. The climbers could ask the Sangam to intervene in inter-community issues, which would cause the Sangam to investigate the situation and determine the validity of any Nadar claims. Then, if necessary, the Sangam would request police intervention or support a claim in court. In situations where the matter went to court, the Sangam would not provide financial support for the Nadar claimant to contest the case, but would rather see that the claim is properly heard. After [[independence of India]], the Sangam took advantage of the constitutional provisions encouraging a caste-less society and also supported government attempts to promote this vision. The support included urging their own community members to allow use of their schools, tanks, temples and wells by other communities. The name of the Nadar bank was changed to [[Tamilnad Mercantile Bank]]. These activities earned the Nadar community respect and recognition.<ref name=\"Hardgrave20\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=159\u2013162}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=Transforming societies, transforming anthropology| edition=| author=Emilio F.

It is the largest of the five subcastes and constitutes about 80 percent of the entire community, including the aristocratic Nelamaikkarars and the climbers beneath them.

There they were traditionally cultivators, traders and money lenders. Legendary accounts claim that the Nattathis are descendants born of the Pandyas and Cholas. The community was mostly Christian and remained an endogamous unit. The overlord of Nattathi was a retainer of the [[Veerapandiya Kattabomman|Kattabomma Nayaka]]. The Nattathi overlord was invested with Zamindari rights under the British. The last of the Nattathi zamindars, Tiruvarudi Vaihunda Nadan, died in 1892.

These include procedures relating to birth, adulthood, marriage and death. Every Hindu Nadar belongs to a ''kuttam'' (assemblage) through patrilineal descent, and each ''kuttam'' has a common family deity. During migration, families would often take soil from their family temple and enshrine it at their new home. Traditionally, all the members of a ''kuttam'' would assemble at least once a year at the family temple. With the birth of a child, the family would traditionally go to the family deity temple, where the hair of the child is shaved for the first time and offered to the deity. At the time of marriage the first invitation is presented to the family deity.<ref name=\"Hardgrave26\"/>  \n   \nThe Hindu Nadars are almost entirely [[Saivite]] (only one ''kuttam'' is [[Vaishnavite]]). Of the deities, [[Murugan]] has been widely popular among the Nadars. Goddess [[Bhadrakali]] is the tutelary deity of the Nadar community. The Nadars also claim that they are the descendants of Bhadrakali. A Bhadrakali temple is usually at the centre of almost every Nadar settlement.<ref name=\"Hardgrave25\">{{Harvnb|Hardgrave|1969|pp=36\u201338}}</ref>  \n   \n[[File:Thamarai-Namam2.png|thumb|60px|right|The socio-religious movement of [[Ayyavazhi]] was pioneered and patronized by the Nadar community.]]  \n   \n==Martial arts==  \nThe Nadars, traditionally practised a Tamil martial art variously known as ''[[Adimurai]]'', ''chinna adi'' and ''varma adi''. In recent years, since 1958, these have been referred to as Southern-style Kalaripayattu, although they are distinct from the ancient martial art of Kalaripayattu itself that was historically the style found in Kerala.<ref>{{cite book |title=Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia.
