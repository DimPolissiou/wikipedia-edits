The '''[[English cricket team in Australia in 1946-47|touring team]]''' played as England in the '''[[1946\u201347 Ashes series]]''' against '''[[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1946-47|Australia]]''', but as the MCC in all other games. In all there were 25 matches; 5 [[Test Cricket|Test matches]] (which they lost 3-0), 13 other [[First-class cricket|First Class matches]] (which they won 1-0) and 7 minor matches (which they won 3-0).

They used this time to acclimatise and practice in the nets, but also to put on weight. Having arrived from a country that had had seven years of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] Australia was a 'land flowing with [[Land of Israel|milk and honey]]' and Hammond promised his men \"the happiest six months of their lives\".<ref>p3, Cary</ref> Everyone in the team put on weight, one \"consuming more in one day in Perth than his full weekly ration in London\" and the big bowlers [[Bill Voce]] and [[Dick Pollard]] adding up to [[Stone (Imperial mass)|two stone]] ([[Pound (mass)|28 lbs]]) in weight.<ref>p3, Cary</ref>  The team sent home food parcels from each city they visited and in general took an easy time of it. A Saturday Night Club was organised in which the team would don [[bow-ties]] in MCC colours and sit down to a full dinner together.

In general the atmosphere was that of a holiday, with the feeling that this was a goodwill tour to re-establish cricketing relations ten years after the last tour of Australia, and that a serious cricket would not begin until the [[1948 Ashes series]].

The Northam captain won the toss and batted, but his team was soon out as big left-arm fast bowler [[Bill Voce]] of [[Bodyline]] fame took 3/11 and [[Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)|Peter Smith]] 5/55 with his leg-spin. The opener Tetlaw top-scored with 34 and added 44 for the fifth wicket with Lawrence (32). Slater made 26 batting at number 7, but no one else reached double figures and they were out for 123. [[Len Hutton]] (51) and [[Cyril Washbrook]] (47) added 93 for the first wicket, then [[Denis Compton]] hit 84 with 11 fours and [[Wally Hammond]] 131 with 19 fours and 4 sixes before he 'retired out' and declared the innings at 409/6 after tea the next day. This proved sufficient to bowl out the Northam team for 71, Tetlaw (29) again top-scored, but [[Bill Edrich]] added figures of 6/20 to his three first innings catches and 38 not out. Smith took 4/18 and the MCC won by an innings and 215 runs inside two days.\n\n==Western Australia Colts vs MCC==\n{{Test match |\n date = 7 October 1946|\n team1 = [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]]|\n team2 = [[Western Warriors|Western Australia Colts]]|\n\n score-team1-inns1 = 197/4 ([[Declaration and forfeiture|dec]])|\n runs-team1-inns1 = [[Paul Gibb|P.A.

It was hoped that a similar wicket in the forthcoming Fourth Test would aid Wright, but the over-prepared Test pitch was \"as dead as [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]\" and it was thought that the MCC pitch had been neglected as a result.<ref>pp182-183, Cary</ref> 34,068 attended the game with [[Australian pound|\u00a32,950]] in receipts.\n\n==Fourth Test \u2013 Adelaide==\n{{Test match |\ndate = 31 January \u2013 6 February 1947|\nteam1 = {{cr|England}}|\nteam2 = {{cr|Australia}}|\n\nscore-team1-inns1 = 460|\nruns-team1-inns1 = [[Denis Compton|Compton, D.C.S.]] 147 <br> [[Len Hutton|Hutton, L]] 94 <br> [[Joe Hardstaff junior|Hardstsaff, J.]] 67 <br> [[Cyril Washbrook|Washbrook, C]] 65|\nwickets-team1-inns1 = [[Ray Lindwall|R.R.

The '''[[English cricket team in Australia in 1946-47|touring team]]''' played as England in the '''[[1946\u201347 Ashes series]]''' against '''[[Australian cricket team in Australia in 1946-47|Australia]]''', but as the MCC in all other games. In all there were 25 matches; 5 [[Test Cricket|Test matches]] (which they lost 3-0), 13 other [[First-class cricket|First Class matches]] (which they won 1-0) and 7 minor matches (which they won 3-0). Australia had been suffering a [[Drought in Australia#Drought in the 20th century|drought since 1937]], but this ended as it rained in every match the MCC played on tour, including tropical thunderstorms twice in [[Brisbane]] and again in [[Sydney]].<ref>p180, Cary</ref> However, this had an adverse effect on the pitches and denied the touring team adequate practice and lead to many draws.\n\n<blockquote>\n''Hammond's ill-equipped army returned to England beaten, yet deserving of the highest honours for their [[sportsmanship]], their ability to smile in the face of certain disaster and also for their success in gaining the objective of their invasion - the spreading of cricket goodwill from the Homeland to a [[Dominion]].''<ref>p1, Cary</ref>\n:[[Clif Cary]]\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Image:Hutton 1947.jpg|thumb|400px|right|[[Len Hutton]] practicing his cover drive at the [[Adelaide Oval]], he topped the first class batting averages for the MCC and the Test batting averages for England.]]\n\n==Traveling to Australia==\n<blockquote>\n''The Stirling Castle was still under the control of War Transport and was equipped more or less as a troopship - no luxury cabins as the case for [[MCC tour of Australia in 1958\u201359|the team]] now.

They used this time to acclimatise and practice in the nets, but also to put on weight. Having arrived from a country that had had seven years of [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing]] Australia was a 'land flowing with [[Land of Israel|milk and honey]]' and Hammond promised his men \"the happiest six months of their lives\".<ref>p3, Cary</ref> Everyone in the team put on weight, one \"consuming more in one day in Perth than his full weekly ration in London\" and the big bowlers [[Bill Voce]] and [[Dick Pollard]] adding up to [[Stone (Imperial mass)|two stone]] ([[Pound (mass)|28 lbs]]) in weight.<ref>p3, Cary</ref>  The team sent home food parcels from each city they visited and in general took an easy time of it. A Saturday Night Club was organised in which the team would don [[bow-ties]] in MCC colours and sit down to a full dinner together. Aware that this would affect their mobility in the field [[physical training]] was organised, but it was not kept up. In general the atmosphere was that of a holiday, with the feeling that this was a goodwill tour to re-establish cricketing relations ten years after the last tour of Australia, and that a serious cricket would not begin until the [[1948 Ashes series]]. The English and Australian press praised them for their sporting attitude and dwelt on the batting prowess of [[Wally Hammond]], [[Len Hutton]], [[Denis Compton]] and the bowling abilities of [[Alec Bedser]] and [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]].<ref>p3, Cary</ref><ref>p377, David Frith, A Pageant of Cricket, The Macmillan Company of Australia, 1986</ref><ref>p51, Swanton</ref>\n\n==Northam and Country Districts vs MCC==\n{{Test match |\n date = 2\u20133 October 1946|\n team1 = Northam and Country Districts|\n team2 = [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]]|\n\n score-team1-inns1 = 123|\n runs-team1-inns1 = J.

All these were fulfilled by playing upcountry games against local [[grade cricket]] teams and as these sides were roughly the equivalent to [[Lancashire League (cricket)|Lancashire League]] they provided the tourists with valuable practice before taking on the state sides and Australia. [[Northam, Western Australia|Northam]] was a small mining town 60 miles inland from [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], but the mine was played out and the local economy was geared to [[Sheep husbandry|sheep-raising]]. After regaining their land legs from their voyage the team travelled up. It had been 10 years since the MCC had toured Australia in [[English cricket team in Australia in 1936-37|1936-37]], the town was decorated as if for a [[f\u00eate]] and the players were entertained by the locals. The Northam captain won the toss and batted, but his team was soon out as big left-arm fast bowler [[Bill Voce]] of [[Bodyline]] fame took 3/11 and [[Peter Smith (cricketer, born 1908)|Peter Smith]] 5/55 with his leg-spin. The opener Tetlaw top-scored with 34 and added 44 for the fifth wicket with Lawrence (32). Slater made 26 batting at number 7, but no one else reached double figures and they were out for 123. [[Len Hutton]] (51) and [[Cyril Washbrook]] (47) added 93 for the first wicket, then [[Denis Compton]] hit 84 with 11 fours and [[Wally Hammond]] 131 with 19 fours and 4 sixes before he 'retired out' and declared the innings at 409/6 after tea the next day. This proved sufficient to bowl out the Northam team for 71, Tetlaw (29) again top-scored, but [[Bill Edrich]] added figures of 6/20 to his three first innings catches and 38 not out. Smith took 4/18 and the MCC won by an innings and 215 runs inside two days.\n\n==Western Australia Colts vs MCC==\n{{Test match |\n date = 7 October 1946|\n team1 = [[Marylebone Cricket Club|MCC]]|\n team2 = [[Western Warriors|Western Australia Colts]]|\n\n score-team1-inns1 = 197/4 ([[Declaration and forfeiture|dec]])|\n runs-team1-inns1 = [[Paul Gibb|P.A.

This was Hammond's 36th double hundred, overtaking [[Don Bradman]]'s record and this early indication of good form gave the Australians some worries (Bradman retook the record in 1947-48). He added 71 with [[Norman Yardley]] (31) and 149 with Smith (46) as the MCC made 477 in 478 minutes.

Robinson won the toss again and they made 462 with David Watt making 157. Barnes and Allan Edwards both made 45 and Johnson 87. The MCC bowling looked plain, but [[Jack Ikin]]'s leg-spin was tested with old fashioned figures of 4/172. From this Hammond concluded that he wasn't a true all-rounder and thereafter used him in the minor games and rarely in the Tests. Every MCC match of the tour was rain-affected and the game finished when the tourists completed their first innings of 308. [[Cyril Washbrook]] (80) and [[Denis Compton]] (98) added 123 against the spin of Johnson (3/76) and Dooland (4/88) which they were seeing for the first time; \"It was amazing to see Compton occasionally run down the pitch, change his mind, and either play the ball like a [[baseball]] bunt, or scamper back to ground his bat in time to get the benefit of the doubt on a stumping appeal\".<ref>p175, Cary</ref> Hammond was scathing of Compton's habit of walking down the wicket to the slow bowlers and his instructions to his batsmen to stay within the crease to the spinners made them play as if nailed to the wicket in the Tests with dire consequences.

It operates [[Airbus A330 MRTT|Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports]] from [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland. The squadron was formed in February 1942 for service during World War&nbsp;II, operating [[Short Empire]] flying boats and a variety of smaller aircraft. By 1944 it had completely re-equipped with [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakota]] transports, which it flew in New Guinea prior to disbanding in May 1946.\n\nThe unit was re-established in February 1981 as a [[flight (military unit)|flight]], equipped with two [[Boeing&nbsp;707]]s for [[Very Important Person|VIP]] and other long-range transport duties out of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales. No.&nbsp;33 Flight was re-formed as a full squadron in July 1983. By 1988 it was operating six 707s, four of which were subsequently converted for aerial refuelling. The 707s saw active service during operations in Namibia, Somalia, the Persian Gulf, and Afghanistan. One of the transport jets was lost in a crash in October 1991. No.&nbsp;33 Squadron relocated to Amberley and was temporarily without aircraft following the retirement of the 707s in June 2008. It began re-equipping with KC-30As in June 2011, and achieved [[initial operating capability]] with the type in February 2013. One of its aircraft was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the [[2014 military intervention against ISIS|military coalition against ISIS]].\n\n==Role and equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Aircraftswoman providing a safety brief onboard a KC-30.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt= Woman in olive-green fatigues holding passenger oxygen mask in aircraft cabin|Crew member giving a safety brief aboard a No. 33 Squadron Airbus KC-30, February 2013]]\nNo. 33 Squadron is responsible for [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]] and long-range transport.<ref name=33Role>{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/Air-Command/Air-Lift-Group/No.-86-Wing/No.-33-Squadron/?RAAF-XHfJqcIhFO+qHJuxeBSgFgWfK7PwJ56L|title=No. 33 Squadron's role|publisher=[[Royal Australian Air Force]]|accessdate=20 July 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504030018/http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/Air-Command/Air-Lift-Group/No.-86-Wing/No.-33-Squadron/?RAAF-XHfJqcIhFO+qHJuxeBSgFgWfK7PwJ56L|archivedate=4 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is located at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland, and controlled by [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;86 Wing]], which is part of [[Air Mobility Group RAAF|Air Mobility Group]].<ref name=33Role/><ref name=AMG>{{cite magazine|url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?startpage=6&iid=91526|last=Hamilton|first=Eamon|title=Symbolic change is perfect timing|magazine=Air Force |volume=56 |issue=8|date=8 May 2014|page=7|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> The unit headquarters comprises executive, administrative and operational components.

It operates [[Airbus A330 MRTT|Airbus KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transports]] from [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland. The squadron was formed in February 1942 for service during World War&nbsp;II, operating [[Short Empire]] flying boats and a variety of smaller aircraft. By 1944 it had completely re-equipped with [[Douglas C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakota]] transports, which it flew in New Guinea prior to disbanding in May 1946.\n\nThe unit was re-established in February 1981 as a [[flight (military unit)|flight]], equipped with two [[Boeing&nbsp;707]]s for [[Very Important Person|VIP]] and other long-range transport duties out of [[RAAF Base Richmond]], New South Wales. No.&nbsp;33 Flight was re-formed as a full squadron in July 1983. By 1988 it was operating six 707s, four of which were subsequently converted for aerial refuelling. The 707s saw active service during operations in Namibia, Somalia, the Persian Gulf, and Afghanistan. One of the transport jets was lost in a crash in October 1991. No.&nbsp;33 Squadron relocated to Amberley and was temporarily without aircraft following the retirement of the 707s in June 2008. It began re-equipping with KC-30As in June 2011, and achieved [[initial operating capability]] with the type in February 2013. One of its aircraft was deployed to the Middle East in September 2014, as part of Australia's contribution to the [[2014 military intervention against ISIS|military coalition against ISIS]].\n\n==Role and equipment==\n[[File:RAAF Aircraftswoman providing a safety brief onboard a KC-30.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt= Woman in olive-green fatigues holding passenger oxygen mask in aircraft cabin|Crew member giving a safety brief aboard a No. 33 Squadron Airbus KC-30, February 2013]]\nNo. 33 Squadron is responsible for [[aerial refueling|aerial refuelling]] and long-range transport.<ref name=33Role>{{cite web|url=http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/Air-Command/Air-Lift-Group/No.-86-Wing/No.-33-Squadron/?RAAF-XHfJqcIhFO+qHJuxeBSgFgWfK7PwJ56L|title=No. 33 Squadron's role|publisher=[[Royal Australian Air Force]]|accessdate=20 July 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130504030018/http://www.airforce.gov.au/About-us/Structure-of-the-RAAF/Air-Command/Air-Lift-Group/No.-86-Wing/No.-33-Squadron/?RAAF-XHfJqcIhFO+qHJuxeBSgFgWfK7PwJ56L|archivedate=4 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is located at [[RAAF Base Amberley]], Queensland, and controlled by [[No. 86 Wing RAAF|No.&nbsp;86 Wing]], which is part of [[Air Mobility Group RAAF|Air Mobility Group]].<ref name=33Role/><ref name=AMG>{{cite magazine|url=http://airforcenews.realviewdigital.com/?startpage=6&iid=91526|last=Hamilton|first=Eamon|title=Symbolic change is perfect timing|magazine=Air Force |volume=56 |issue=8|date=8 May 2014|page=7|accessdate=5 May 2014}}</ref> The unit headquarters comprises executive, administrative and operational components.

Scholars believe that sports have been a historical avenue for Jewish people to overcome obstacles toward their participation in secular society (especially before the mid-20th century in Europe and the United States).<ref>''See, e.g.'': ''Encyclopedia of Jewish people in Sports'' by Bernard Postal, Jesse Silver, Roy Silver (1965); ''Great Jews in Sports'' by [[Robert Slater]] (2003), {{ISBN|0-8246-0453-9}}; ''Emancipation Through Muscles: Jews and Sports in Europe'' by Michael Brenner, Gideon Reuveni (2006), {{ISBN|0-8032-1355-7}}; ''Jewish, Sports, and the Rites of Citizenship'' ed.

Elections have tended to have more participation in each successive election, due to the increasing population of the United States, and, in some instances, expansion of the right to vote to larger segments of society. Prior to the election of 1824, most states did not have a popular vote. In the election of 1824, only 18 of the 24 states held a popular vote, but by the election of 1828, 22 of the 24 states held a popular vote.

Elections have tended to have more participation in each successive election, due to the increasing population of the United States, and, in some instances, expansion of the right to vote to larger segments of society. Prior to the election of 1824, most states did not have a popular vote. In the election of 1824, only 18 of the 24 states held a popular vote, but by the election of 1828, 22 of the 24 states held a popular vote. Minor candidates are excluded if they received fewer than 100,000 votes, or less than .1% of the vote in their election year.\n\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n\n! Candidate\n! Year\n! Party\n!

Designed in 1914, the building completed in 1916, and fully furnished by 1917. The chapel's architecture and fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a leading member of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and interior statuettes, floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely guided the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in it's artwork, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows; fifteen show Irish saints, the remainder show Christ, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] and [[John the Baptist|St. John]]. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including by Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who died in August 1913{{sfn|Rogers|1997|p=209}} Her will left a total donation to the city of \u00a340,000 gave \u00a310,000, left [[Trust law|in trust]] to O'Connell, the sole executor of her will.

Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E.

Following the events of the 1916 [[Easter Rising|Easter Rising]], he and his wife left Dublin city to move into a cottage in [[Mount Merrion]], [[Blackrock, Dublin|Blackrock]]. Clarke was working under considerable pressure to meet an October deadline, so that the three windows would be built and installed for the Chapels consecration on November 5th.

Brigid is depicted alongside a [[bovine|calf]], Patrick with a [[shamrock]] in his right hand, and Columcille alongside two flying [[doves]]. The Brigid light is especially detailed and contains an angel at the top of the window, and another four hovering at its foot.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was a commercial success and often competed against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned on the east gable above the altar.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours, and with a strong but dignified facial expression.  O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the foot of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing had to be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=210-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212-213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer. It is decorated with symbols the [[zodiac]],{{sfn|McClatchie|2006|p=14}} and images based on the mythological \"River of Life\",{{sfn|NIAH|2000}}{{sfn|Field|2006}} as well as depictions of flora, fauna and river scenes.<ref name=\"lel\" /> The designs celebrate the [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] of the earth, and illustrate passages from the [[Old Testament]], including the \"[[Benedicite]]\" (also known as \"A Song of Creation\") from the [[Book of Daniel]], which was [[Laudate psalms|sung]] during the [[Lauds|office of lauds]] on Sundays and [[Calendar of saints|feast days]]. The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], as Jesus is traditionally thought to have risen from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the resurrection.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}{{sfn|Lawrence|1962|pp=289-296}} The reference serves to emphasize how Jesus overcame death. This connection is further made by the inclusion of the trees ([[tree of life]]) which in mythology grow in paradise and represent Christ, and the surrounding animals at rest, presented as symbols of his Christian followers.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=118}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chapel of the Sacred Heart (Dingle)]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Baker|first= R.

Designed in 1914, the building completed in 1916, and fully furnished by 1917. The chapel's architecture and fittings are representative of the [[Celtic revival]] movement which sought to echo the [[Insular art|aesthetic style]] that flourished in Ireland and Britain between the 7th and 12th centuries.{{sfn|Sheehy|1980|pp=163, 164}}\n\nIt's construction was initiated and closely supervised by [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]], a leading member of the Celtic revival and [[Arts and Crafts]] movements. He was funded by Isabella Honan (1861-1913), the last member of a wealthy Cork family, who provided large donations towards the build of the chapel. O'Connell oversaw both the architecture design and the commissioning of its exterior carvings and interior statuettes, floor, furniture and liturgical collection. He closely guided the work of the architect James F. McMullen, the builders [[Sisk Group|John Sisk and Sons]], and hired the craftsmen and artists involved in it's artwork, many of whom incorporated elements of the [[Art Nouveau]] style.\n\nThe Honan is internationally known{{sfn|Teehan|2016|p=80}} for its interior which is designed and fitted in a traditionally Irish style, but with an appreciation of current trends in international art.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=3}} Its furnishings include the mosaic flooring, altar plates, metal work and enamels, liturgical textiles and sanctuary furnishings, and especially its nineteen [[stained glass]] windows; fifteen show Irish saints, the remainder show Christ, [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], [[Saint Joseph|St. Joseph]] and [[John the Baptist|St. John]]. Eleven were designed and installed by [[Harry Clarke]], a major Irish artist who completed the works aged twenty seven. His windows were described by the art historian Nicola Gordon Bowe as \"arguably his greatest work in stained glass\".{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} A further eight were designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine O'Brien]] and [[Ethel Rhind]] of \"[[An T\u00far Gloine]]\" (''The Glass Tower'') cooperative studio, founded by [[Sarah Purser]] in 1903.\n\n==Commission==\nPopulation growth and migration in the early 20th century led to the development of a number of suburbs around [[Cork (city)|Cork city]]. This necessitated the building of churches to serve the people living in the new urban areas, and the Honan was the first church built in Cork in the new century. The reasons for its development were very different to those for other contemporary churches, resulting from a longstanding educational disagreement between the [[Protestant]] and Catholic hierarchies. Queens College Cork (today known as [[University College Cork]] (UCC)), was incorporated in 1845 as part of a series of new universities known as the Queen's Colleges,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} under a charter that excluded Catholic students.{{sfn|Baker|1999|p=165}}\n\n[[File:Honan Hostel.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|The Honan Hostel]]\nThis ended in 1911 when the Queen's Colleges folded as legal entities, and as a result students of both denominations were allowed to attend. The Irish Universities Act of 1908 stipulated that government funding could not be allocated towards \"any church, chapel, or other place of religious worship or observance\".<ref>{{cite web|url = http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/eli/1908/act/38/enacted/en/print.html | title = Irish Universities Act, 1908 | publisher = Government of Ireland | website = irishstatutebook.ie | accessdate = 1 September 2019}}</ref> The 1908 legislation meant that any centre for Catholic students in an Irish university could only be attained through private funding.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=163}} Such terms were seen by some as restrictive on Catholic students, including by Sir [[Bertram Windle]],{{sfn|Leland|2004}} the university's president, and [[John O'Connell (Solicitor)|John O'Connell]] (1868-1943), who described the act as \"absurd and scandalous\".{{sfn|J.J.H.|1916|p=613}}<ref name=\"wg\" />\n\n===Isabella Honan===\nIsabella Honan (n\u00e9e Cunningham, 1861-1913) was the sister-in-law of Robert Honan, the last male heir of a wealthy Catholic family who had made their money in the 19th century as butter merchants.{{sfn|O'Connell|1916|p=11}}{{sfn|Ryan|2016|p=3}} Robert and his brother Matthew were dead by 1909,{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} with Robert having left his fortune to Isabella, who died in August 1913{{sfn|Rogers|1997|p=209}} Her will left a total donation to the city of \u00a340,000 gave \u00a310,000, left [[Trust law|in trust]] to O'Connell, the sole executor of her will.

Firstly, as it was based on medieval churches and the old rites, it was built with a large spacial divide between the nave and chancel, in addition the altar was positioned at the very back of the chancel, with the priest facing away from the congregation.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} In 1986, the German-Irish sculptor [[Imogen Stuart]] was hired by the firm of Richard Hurley & Associates Architects, tasked with the overall redevelopment of the chapel, to redesign the altar, [[pulpit]], priest's chair and baptismal font.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} Stuart's design brought clergy and attendants closer together by the use of a movable altar.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=196}} Although first intended for the center of the chancel, on the focal point of the mosaic, but this proved to be too far back and impracticable during ceremonies.<ref name=\"rha\">\"[http://www.rha.ie/honan.html Portfolio: Honan Chapel, University College Cork]\".

Around them, two angles carry the sun, moon, and other symbols of creation. The lower rectangular panel, representing the doorway, shows the Adoration of the Lamb, with the lamb standing on brightly coloured altar decorated with three ringed crosses. Two angels acting as servers kneel before him. The adoration panel is set against a background of branches and leaves attached in [[silver-gilt]].{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}}\n\nThe lower panel also shows the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove, surrounded by what Teehan describes as \"the deep blue void of Heaven\".{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}} Here he is accompanied by flights of angels, bearing instruments of the passion.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}} The enamel embellishments were added by the Irish craftsman and stained glass specialist Oswald Reeves,{{sfn|Larmour|1992|p=186}} and have been described as the best of his work.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=86}}\n\n===Pipe organ===\nThe pipe organ is located on the west wall in a timber frame.{{sfn|NIAH|2000}} It was built by [[Wicklow]] native Kenneth Jones and installed in 1996.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|McClatchie|2006|p=14}}\n\n==Stained glass windows==\n{{multiple image\n | align        = left\n | direction    = horizontal\n | header_align = \n | footer_align = \n | image1       = Harry Clarke (photo).jpg\n | width1       = 160\n | caption1     = Harry Clarke\n | image2       = Sarah Purser by John Butler Yeats.png\n | width2       = 138\n | caption2     = Sarah Purser\n}}\n\nThe chapel contains 19 stained glass windows. The nave is lined with six at either side, mostly by Clarke, three in the west gable, and four in the chancel.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} O'Connell deliberately placed Harry Clarke and [[Sarah Purser]]'s [[An T\u00far Gloine]] studio in competition for the window's commission.{{sfn|Kennedy|2015|p=99}} After he was sent Clarke's initial designs for the St. Gobnait window, O'Connell immediately a total of eleven windows, out of a planned nineteen.{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1979|p=99}} Clarke's windows were praised by several commentators when first shown in Dublin, with collector Thomas Bodkin writing that \"nothing like Mr Clark's windows had been seen before in Ireland\" and noting the \"sustained magnificence of colour...intricate drawing...[and] lavish and mysterious [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]].\"{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=163}}\n\nThe Clarke and T\u00far Gloine's windows contain similar subject matter and imagery, but vastly differ in style.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Clarke's are highly detailed, while An T\u00far Gloine's are deliberately simple. Both studios were asked to depict Gaelic saints from the \"golden age\" of [[Christianity in Ireland]].{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=28}} Each displayed their [[Modello|cartoons]] in Dublin before they were physically realised in Cork. Both shows were highly praised, and lead to some debate among art critics as to which sets were superior. In 1955, the Irish [[Michael J. O'Kelly]] summarised that each of the Honan windows are high quality and worthy of individual consideration. While his notes especially single out the windows designed by [[Alfred E. Child|A. E. Child]], O'Kelly believes that preferences come down to matters of personal taste.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-295}}\n\nThe windows in the chancel are: Our Lord (or \"Christ [[Christ in Majesty|in Majesty]]\") (Child), Our Lady [[Our Lady of Sorrows|of Sorrows]] (Clarke), St. John (O'Brien) and St. Joseph (Clarke).{{sfn|HayesRogers|2012|pp=128, 130}} To the right of the chancel looking down are: St. Finnbarr (Clarke), St. Albert (Clarke), St. Declan (Clarke), St. Ailbe (Child), St. Fauchtna (Child) and St. Munchin (O'Brien).

The designs are deeply and richly coloured, employing a deep, thick and rich [[royal blue]] throughout. They contain simplified, often whimsical forms which are nevertheless highly stylised and evoke, in the words of the writer M. J. O'Kelly, \"the spirit of the [[Ancient Celtic religion|ancient Celt]]\".{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}} The panels blends Catholic [[iconography]] with motifs and events from Celtic mythology{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} in a style that draws heavily from [[Art Nouveau]], in particular the darker, ''[[fin de si\u00e8cle]]'' works of [[Aubrey Beardsley]], [[Gustav Klimt]] and [[Egon Schiele]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nThe panels contain a multitude of Celtic designs and motifs, and are filled with figures and incidents from the life of each saint. The most obvious Celtic embellishments are [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary's]] red hair and green [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]], and Brendan's [[pampooties]].{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}} The light of St. [[Albert of Cashel]], who wears a purple [[chasuble]], crimson [[Stole (vestment)|stole]] and a bishop's [[mitre]], contains several Celtic motifs, including the bronze spirals placed around his hair and beard.{{sfn|Costigan|Cullen|2019|p=57}} His depictions often detail magical feats associated with the saint, which Gibbon describes as \"daring\" inclusions, given such deeds owe more to [[Paganism|pagan]] legend rather than \"respectable traits of virtue and holiness.\"{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=332}}\n\nSome of the windows came close to being destroyed during the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] in Dublin.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=19}} Before the windows were installed in Cork, the cartoons were displayed at his Dublin studio (known as the \"The Tower of Glass\"),{{sfn|Rogers|1997|p=209}} where they were praised by contemporary art critics.{{efn-ua|Clarke's career in stained glass peaked early; from the mid 1920 he was preoccupied with legacy commissions left over from his father's workshop.

Sarah Purser and Edward Martyn formed and financed the T\u00far Gloine workshop in 1903,{{sfn|Gordon Bowe|1985|p=39}} which was a commercial success and often competed against Clarke for commissions.{{sfn|Gibbons|2018|p=311}} She recruited A. E. Child, a teacher at the [[National College of Art and Design|Metropolitan School of Art]] in Dublin, who managed the workshop often employing pupils of his.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=99, 167}} The eight windows are attributed to Child (St. Ailbe, St. Fachtna and St. Coleman), and his former pupils [[Catherine Amelia O'Brien|Catherine (Kitty) O'Brien]]  (St. John, St. Flannan and St. Munchin) and [[Ethel Rhind]] (St. Carthagh).{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=295}}\n\nAlthough their designs are similar to Clark's in subject matter, they are very different in style. The windows are minimalist in line and colour, consisting of a dominating but simplicity rendered and naturalistic central figure rendered in pale hues,{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} surrounded by uncomplicated, largely empty opaque sub-panels. The most prominently placed window is Child's \"Our Lord\", positioned on the east gable above the altar.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294}} Child depicts the risen Christ in simple forms and subdued colours, and with a strong but dignified facial expression.  O'Kelly's describes the portrait of his eyes \"as look(ing) out on humanity with a welcoming and understanding sympathy.\"{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=294-5}}\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\" widths=\"180px\" heights=\"180px\" perrow=\"3\">\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (b).jpg|\"St. Fachtna\", Child c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Honan (d).jpg|\"St. Ailbe\" (detail), Child, c. 1916\nFile:An T\u00far Gloine Hanan (a).jpg|\"St. Flannan\" (detail), O'Brien, c. 1916\n</gallery>\n\n====St. John (O'Brien)====\nO'Brien's \"St. John\" window is, according to the art historians Myra Hayes and Jessie Rogers, \"the only window in the entire chapel to portray biblical narratives in any detail.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=128}} It is usually considered the strongest of An T\u00far Gloine's windows, both in the strength of its imagery and in its craftsmanship. Sometimes mistakenly attributed to Child, it is very different to Child's \"Our Lord\" window, which is reminiscent of a more traditional style of stained glass design. Although O'Brien has not received the same level of study as other members of the An T\u00far Gloine studio, both Virginia Teehan and Nicola Gordon Bowe have commented on her \"beguiling narrative details\" and \"successful harmonisation of colour with The Clarke windows in the chapel\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=131}}\n\nThe window is divided into three [[Register (art)|registers]], with three pairs of medallions below each panel. The imagery is mostly based on scenes from the life of Christ, based on the [[Gospel of John]], and draws more from close readings of scripture than traditions of iconography. The upper register is based on [[Revelation 1|Revelations 1:1]], and shows a vision of the glorified Christ in Majesty, with the Alpha and Omega symbols and the seven candles. John, who throughout the panels is depicted as beardless young man, is shown at the side with his head bowed. The two medallions below this are based on the Gospel of John, and show, on the left, [[St. Peter]] and John running towards Jesus' tomb (with John outpacing Peter), and on the right, Jesus walking with Peter, with St John following behind.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=130}}\n\nThe crucifixion scene in the central register is more richly coloured that the other panels, and per tradition shows Mary and St. John at the foot of the cross. Less usual, and more usual of Protestant than Catholic iconography,{{efn-ua|O'Brien, who joined An T\u00far Gloine in 1904, came from an [[Anglo-Irish]], and devout [[Church of Ireland]] family. She is credited with three windows in the Honan. See Hayes & Rogers (2012), pp. 130, 131}} is the presence of a serpent with its mouth open, coiled around the cross below Jesus' feet. The serpent probably refers to [[Seed of the woman|Genesis 3:15]], which reads: \"And I will put enmity between thee (the serpent) and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.\"{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The medallions below the crucifixion reflect two accounts of John's brother [[James the Great|James]], \"the disciple whom Jesus loved\".{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}} The lowest register is again in bright colours and shows the calling of James and John. The images stays with scriptural tradition; they are accompanied by their father, and are the second pair to be called, after St. Peter and [[St. Andrew]], who are already at Jesus' side. [[Eagle of Saint John|The eagle]] at the foot of the window is John's usual symbol.{{sfn|Hayes|Rogers|2012|p=129}}\n\n==Artwork, furnishings and liturgical collection==\nO'Connell commissioned the Cork firm of Egan & Sons for the altar plate and vestments. He had a strong view on how the chapel should be presented and was keen that its artwork would draw from Ireland's ancient culture. In this, he was heavily influenced by 19th century [[antiquarian]]'s research into early Christian and early medieval traditions and art, in particular the early medieval metal and stone works, and [[illuminated manuscript]]s at the time being newly discovered. He sought that the Honan would further reflect and promote the earlier period's emergent influence on Irish literature and visual culture.{{sfn|Wilson|2018|p=21}}\n\n===Furnishings===\nThe furnishings, including the pews, were designed to blend into the chapel's Celtic Revival style, and, according to Teehan create \"a way that represented the spirit and skill of earlier times , [that] could be nonetheless be fully appreciated by contemporary society. The overall effect is one of simplicity and restfulness.\" Such pieces include the circular iron ventilation ceiling panels and the chair and [[kneeler]] reserved for the president. Most of these wfittings were designed by McMullen, most of the others, including the [[pew]]s, by Sisk & Son. Changes in [[liturgy]] following [[Vatican II]] meant that a number of furnishing had to be replaced, most of which were physically moved to storerooms of the University.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=232}}\n\n===Metalwork===\nThe chapel has an extensive collection of metalwork and enamel pieces. They were built by Edmond Johnson's, Dublin, and the Cork firm William Egan & sons. All are in the Celtic Revival style. A highlight is the large [[processional cross]], a replication of the 12th century [[Cross of Cong]], which contains a number of inscriptions, including a remembrance for the chapel's benefactors: Mathew, Robert and Isabella Honan, and for John and Mary O'Connell.{{sfn|O'Callaghan|2016|p=168}}{{sfn|Beecher|1971|p=53}} Other items include a processional crosses, [[chalice]]s, candlesticks, dishes, bells, hinges, and the iron gates at the entrance.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=202-209}}\n\n===Textiles===\nMost of the textile collection was designed by the [[Dun Emer Press|Durn Emer]] guild, Dublin, and includes vestments, [[chasuble]]s, burses, veils, [[stole]]s, [[Maniple (vestment)|maniple]]s, altar cloths, wall hangings and altar fronts. Materials vary from silk embroidery, gold braid, gold thread, linen, [[poplin]] and cotton. The names of seamstresses from the Egan workshop are embroidered in the lining of some of the textile commissions.<ref name=\"ff\" /> In general the textiles are coloured in line with changes in the seasonal of the liturgical year. Most of the designs are centred around the Life of Mary, or the Passion, or Crucifixion, with black and white being the predominant colours.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=210-225}} A highlight is the  Y-shaped, silver threaded [[chasuble]] in black poplin cloth, used as a vestment for funerals. A violet altar cloth with a frontlet, decorated with Celtic interlacing in shades of purple silk, orange and yellow highlights, and a border of lemon and violet cotton satin, is used to decorate the altar and candlesticks.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=201}}\n\nThe \"Black set\" of Honan textiles includes an altar frontal with a Celtic cross based on a grave stone from [[Tullylease]] Cork, a black [[cope]] and hood containing a crown of thorns design and a black chasuble designed for funeral masses containing Celtic interlace patterns.{{snf|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=212-213}}\n\n==Mosaic floor==\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115659.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|River of Life with fish]]\n[[File:Honan floor Tyger.jpg|thumb|upright==1.0|Pelican and tiger]]\nThe mosaic flooring was designed and installed by a German firm lead by the English resident Ludwig Oppenheimer.

The pattern at the entrance contains a verse from [[Psalm 148]] (\"Praise to the Lord from Creation\").{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=114}}\n\n[[File:Cork - Honan Chapel - 20180907115632.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Floor mosaic with sea creature]]\nThe floor mosaic comprises of four sections. It begins at the main entrance on the west side with a [[sunburst]] and stars, surrounded by signs of the zodiac. The center of the aisle shows a beast's head, acting as the river mouth{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=107}} from which flows a river with fish swimming towards the chancel. The east side of the nave contains a large coiled sea creature, which appears to be part serpent, part dragon, part whale, {{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} and a number of animals, including stags, deer and sheep, drinking from the river. Around them a series of exotic birds flying within forest trees.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|p=293}} The section inside the chancel itself show a globe and symbols of creation, including animals, plants and [[solar system|planets]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=111, 112}} Interlaced Celtic and [[Zoomorphism|zoomorphs]] designs around the borders unify the four sections.{{sfn|O'Kelly|1950|pp=293, 294}}\n\nThe image of the sun and surrounding night stars inside the chapel's entrance signifies both the new day and [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrection]], as Jesus is traditionally thought to have risen from the dead at dawn. Reflecting 12th century Christian art, the presence of signs of the zodiac indicate God's dominion over time.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} The beast's head in the aisle contains a series of tripartite motifs representing the [[Trinity]]: spirals, [[trefoil]] knots and interlace containing three [[Saltire|saltire crosses]]. The sea creature on the east end of the nave is mentioned in the verse contained on the floor by the entrance \"dracones et omnes abyssi\" (''Dragons and all the depths'').{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=116}} Alongside it are the words \"cete et omnia quae moventur in aquis\" (''whales and all that move in the water''), words that in medieval [[exegesis]] conjured images of death, and direct reference to [[Jonah]].{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}} \n\nThe colouring of the floor by and inside the chancel is more subdued, and the imagery more restrained. The images show a paradise, that can be interpreted both as the [[garden of Eden]], or the eternal paradise promised at the end of time. The imagery is of the seasons, [[Classical element|elements]], and symbols of the resurrection.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|pp=120-121}} \n\nA similar depiction on a 5th century sarcophagus in the [[Lateran Museum]] shows Jonah swimming towards the open jaws of a whale with horned ears, and a long, coiled tail.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=117}}{{sfn|Lawrence|1962|pp=289-296}} The reference serves to emphasize how Jesus overcame death. This connection is further made by the inclusion of the trees ([[tree of life]]) which in mythology grow in paradise and represent Christ, and the surrounding animals at rest, presented as symbols of his Christian followers.{{sfn|Teehan|Heckett|2005|p=118}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chapel of the Sacred Heart (Dingle)]]\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{notelist-ua|30em}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n=== Sources ===\n{{refbegin|40em}}\n* {{cite journal|last=Baker|first= R.

In military weddings, especially those of commissioned officers, a guard, composed usually of service members of the same branch, form the [[Saber arch]]. In principle any military unit could act as a guard of honour. However, in some countries certain units are specially designated for guard of honour duty.\n\nGuards of Honour also serve in the civilian world for fallen police officers and other civil servants. Certain religious bodies, especially Churches of the Anglican Communion and the Methodist movement, have the tradition of an Honour Guard at the funeral of an ordained elder, in which all other ordained elders present \"guard the line\" between the door of the church and the grave, or [[hearse]] if the deceased is to be buried elsewhere or cremated.<ref>Traditions of the United Methodist Church</ref> The practice of providing a guard of honour as a mark of respect also occurs in sports, especially throughout the [[Commonwealth of Nations]].\n\n==Uniformed guards of honour by country==\nGuards of honour from the military, police, emergency services and other uniformed paramilitary organizations are often displayed in the same representative manner.\n\n===Africa===\n====Algeria====\n[[File:Secretary Clinton Prepares To Meet With Algerian President Bouteflika (8141535559).jpg|thumb|The [[Algerian Republican Guard]] welcoming the [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]]. The Guard is a ceremonial corps of the [[Algerian Army]].]]\nThe [[Algerian Republican Guard]] is a mainly ceremonial military corps of the [[Algerian Army]]. Composed of 6,000 troops, it is very similar in its formation style to equivalent units in the [[French Army]]. The Republican Guard includes a [[military band]] and a [[cavalry]] unit, the uniform and traditions of which are based on those of the famous [[Berber people|Berber]] cavalry, the [[Numidian cavalry]], the French cavalry, and the [[Arab]] cavalry.\n\n====Egypt====\nThe [[Egyptian Republican Guard]] is a division level unit in the [[Egyptian Army]] which is the seniormost unit in the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] that has the responsibility of defending the President of Egypt, as well as major presidential and national institutions. It is a type of guard regiment that is composed of dozens upon dozens of armored brigades, mechanized brigades and divisional artillery, Being the seniormost unit in the armed forces, the Republican Guard Division is the only major military unit allowed in central [[Cairo]] besides the troops of intelligence services and [[Central Security Forces]].\n\n====Nigeria====\nThe members of the [[Presidential Guard Brigade (Nigeria)|Nigerian Presidential Guard Brigade]] are elite Nigerian soldiers who guard the residence of the [[President of Nigeria|President of the Federal Republic]] and his or her guests as well as performing ceremonial duties. It is similar to the [[United States Secret Service]] in that its members also provide security for visiting heads of state. The brigade performs a weekly [[changing of the guard]] ceremony outside [[Aso Villa]] and stands guard at the Presidential Villa. Aside from that, the guards brigade also mounts the guard of honour for [[state visit]]s, as well as the [[Independence Day (Nigeria)|Independence Day]] [[Military Parade]] in [[Abuja]]. The brigade is the senior unit in the [[Nigerian Army]]'s [[order of battle]].\n\n====Senegal====\n[[File:Obama inspecting the Red Guard 01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Barack Obama]] inspecting the [[Red Guard of Senegal]]. The Guard's uniform is derived from that of the [[Spahi]].]]\nThe [[Red Guard of Senegal]] is a Senegalese Gendarmerie unit that is responsible for maintaining the security of the [[President of Senegal]]. It is similar to the ceremonial elements in the [[French Republican Guard]]. The unit's uniform is derived from the French colonial [[Spahi]]. The Red Guard is under the direct command of the Security Legion of the Senegalese [[Mobile Gendarmerie]]. It is composed of many units that serve ceremonial duties, with the most notable being the honour guard battalion and the mounted squadron.\n\n====South Africa====\nThe guard of honour unit in [[South Africa]] was the [[State Presidents Guard]] (Staatspresidentseenheid) until 1990.<ref>{{cite news|title=State President's Unit|url=http://www.sadf.info/TitleNationalColours.html|publisher=[[South African National Defence Force]]|date=}}</ref> The unit has since been replaced by the [[National Ceremonial Guard]] in the [[South African National Defence Force]]. Permanent honour guards in the country had not existed prior to the Staatspresidentseenheid's founding in 1967. In compensation for a lack of ceremonial units, the [[Citizen Force (South Africa)|Citizen Force]] and the [[Cape Town Highlanders Regiment]] were often deployed for ceremonial events.<ref>http://samilitaryhistory.org/vol131as.html</ref> Following the abolition of [[apartheid]] in South Africa, the guard was disestablished, leaving the defence forces without an official guard of honour until 1995, when the NCG was founded.\n\n====Zimbabwe====\nThe [[Presidential Guard (Zimbabwe)|Presidential Guard]] is an elite combat unit of the [[Zimbabwe National Army]], serving as a [[Household Division]]-like service for the [[President of Zimbabwe]]. The unit, in their green service uniform and yellow berets, mount the guard of honour on behalf of the [[Zimbabwe Defence Forces]]. Past events where the guard of honour provided by the presidential guard includes [[Defence Forces Day]] festivities, Heroes Day', the [[Independence Day]] Parade, and the inauguration of [[Emmerson Mnangagwa]].\n\nThe flag of the Presidential Guard of Zimbabwe consists of a beige background, with three equal horizontal stripes of red, green and red, and the centre having a shield which contains a white wreath beneath a bird, over which are two brown rifles in saltire.<ref>https://fotw.info/flags/zw%5Epgds.html#pgds</ref> The brigade is based currently at Dzivarasekwa Barracks in [[Harare]] and is led by Brigadier Anselem Sanyatwe.\n\n===Americas===\n====Argentina====\n[[File:Mauricio Macri & Obama on the Pink House.jpg|thumb|The members of the [[Argentine Army]]'s [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]] serve as the country's ceremonial guards.]]\nThe [[Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers]] serves as a part of the [[Argentine Army]], serving as the presidential guard and ceremonial companions. Two unmounted grenadiers are stationed in front of [[Casa Rosada|the Pink House]] as a symbol of the ceremonial and honour guard.\n\n====Brazil====\nThe Brazilian armed forces and [[Military Police (Brazil)|police]] have several troops for ceremonial usages. The most important of them is the [[president of Brazil|Brazilian president's]] honour guard. It is composed of the 1st Guards Cavalry Regiment (1o Regimento de Cavalaria de Guardas \u2013 RCG, in Portuguese) \u2013 \"[[Dragoon#Brazil|Independence Dragoons]]\", the [[Presidential Guard Battalion (Brazil)|Presidential Guard Battalion]] (Batalh\u00e3o da Guarda Presidencial \u2013 BGP, in Portuguese) and the [[Cayenne Battery]].\n\n====Canada====\n[[File:Sergio Mattarella al Rideau Hall 08.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Governor General's Foot Guards]] are one of two [[Foot Guards|foot guard]] regiments in the [[Canadian Army]].]]\n[[Public duties|Military public duties]] in [[Ottawa]], Canada's national capital, are formally the responsibility of two regiments of [[foot guards]]: the [[Canadian Grenadier Guards]] and the [[Governor General's Foot Guards]].

The two regiments of foot guards, together with the [[Governor General's Horse Guards]], based in [[Toronto]], make up Canada's [[Household Division]].\n\nThe Canadian Army also operates a summer public duties detachment known as the [[Ceremonial Guard]], which assumes public duties in Ottawa from late-June to late-August.<ref name=CGbac>{{cite web|url=http://www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/news-publications/national-news-details-no-menu.page?doc=the-ceremonial-guard-backgrounder/jwmfywcz|title=The Ceremonial Guard - Backgrounder|date=June 2019|accessdate=6 September 2019|publisher=Government of Canada|website=army-armee.forces.gc.ca}}</ref> The Ceremonial Guard is made up of [[Regular Force|regulars]] or [[Primary Reserve|reservists]] of the Canadian Army, although its membership is also augmented by members regulars and reservists of the [[Royal Canadian Air Force]], and the [[Royal Canadian Navy]].<ref name=cgoff>{{cite web|url=http://www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/ceremonial-guard/index.page|title=Ceremonial Guard of the Canadian Armed Forces|publisher=Government of Canada|website=army-armee.forces.gc.ca|date=4 July 2019|accessdate=6 September 2019}}</ref> Like the foot guards, the Ceremonial Guards also mount the guard of honour for military funerals, and visiting dignitaries while in season.<ref name=CGbac/><ref>https://www.canada.ca/en/services/defence/caf/military-identity-system/drill-manual/chapter-10.html</ref> Members of the Ceremonial Guard wear the uniforms of the Canadian foot guards, as they have historically staffed the summer public duties detachment, before membership in the Ceremonial Guard was opened to the entire Canadian Armed Forces.<ref name=cgoff/> The Ceremonial Guard are considered an ''ad hoc'' detachment, as its members are drawn from various units of the armed forces, and does not constitute a permanent unit in the Canadian Forces' [[order of battle]].\n\nIn addition to the Canadian foot guards, and the Ceremonial Guards, units with regularly scheduled guard mountings include the [[Royal 22nd Regiment]]. The regiment mounts the guard from late-June to [[Labour Day]] (the first Monday of September) at the [[Citadelle of Quebec]] in [[Quebec City]], a military installation, and secondary residence of the Monarch and Governor General.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitadelle.qc.ca/en/activities/changing-of-the-guard.html|title=Quebec's only Changing of the Guard ceremony|publisher=Mus\u00e9e Royal 22e R\u00e9giment|year=2017|accessdate=6 September 2019|website=lacitadelle.qc.ca}}</ref> However, as the unit is based in Quebec City, they rarely mount the guard of honour for foreign dignitaries.\n\nGuards of honour are also formed by civilian police, and fire services, including the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]]. These civilian honour guards are typically mounted for funerals, and local ceremonies, with the honour guard units typically made up of 30 to 60 members. Some, like the [[York Regional Police]], operate a mounted honour guard unit. Fire and rescue ceremonial units such as the [[Toronto Fire Services]] Honour Guard and the Calgary Firefighters Honour Guard are unique in that they are armed with a ceremonial [[axe]].\n\n====Colombia====\nThe [[37th Infantry Presidential Guard Battalion]], composed of five companies, a historical company and one [[artillery battery]] plus a military band, a fanfare trumpet section and [[Corps of Drums]], is the [[President of Colombia]]'s honour guard service regiment under the [[National Army of Colombia]]. It is stationed at the [[Casa de Nari\u00f1o]] in [[Bogota]] where the changing of the guard ceremony takes place three days per week and carries the traditions of Simon Bolivar's infantry guards company raised in the midst of the [[Spanish American wars of independence]] in 1815.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ejercito.mil.co/?idcategoria=277533|title=Batall\u00f3n de Infanter\u00eda No. 37 Guardia Presidencial - DIV05|first=Micrositios Content|last=Manager|website=Ej\u00e9rcito Nacional de Colombia}}</ref>\n\n====Cuba====\n[[File:Fidel Castro11.jpeg|thumb|[[Fidel Castro]] and [[Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva]] inspect honour guards from the [[Ceremonial Unit of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]].]]\nThe [[Ceremonial Unit of the Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]] provided honours for the [[Communist Party of Cuba]], the [[Government of Cuba]], and the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces]]. It is a sort of mix between Russian and German ceremonial formations, with the unit notably adopting the German-born [[goosestep]]. Its ceremonial duties are usually performed at government buildings and notable areas in [[Havana]], with the [[Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n]] (the main square in the capital) and the [[Palace of the Revolution]] (the workplace of the [[President of Cuba]]). The main purpose of the military unit is the performance of the changing of the guard every half an hour at the Jos\u00e9 Marti Mausoleum in [[Santiago de Cuba]]. Prior to [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[1959 Cuban Revolution]], honour guards were performed by units that resembled honour guard units in the [[United States]], such as [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|The Old Guard]].\n\n====Haiti====\nHaitian honour guard duties are performed by the General Security Unit of the National Palace of the [[Haitian National Police]] (L'Unit\u00e9 de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Palais National, USGPN) which is a major specialized unit of the PNH. It has, since 1997, mainly ensured security at the [[National Palace (Haiti)|Palais National]] and the security of the [[President of Haiti]]. The USGPN works with the Presidential Security Unit (Unit\u00e9 de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sidentielle, USP) to protect the president, as well as intervene when a crime takes place and or assist police officers in their duties, outside of the USGPN's ceremonial ones.

The most distant antecedents of the Presidential Honour Guard go back to the Hussars Troop of Simon Bolivar, of the Venezuelan War of Independence and of the larger Spanish American wars of independence, raised in June 1815 and part of a more bigger guards brigade targeted for the immediate security of the Liberator, and the early 20th century 1st Cavalry Regiment \"Ambrosio Plaza\" that until the 1950s, albelt reduced to squadron size, provided the ceremonial security of the President and was modeled on the Prussian horse guards units of the late 19th century. The modern brigade serves as a ceremonial escort to the President of Venezuela at [[Miraflores Palace]] and attends all state arrival ceremonies conducted there, as well as providing security for the palace complex. The brigade also provides honour guards (i) at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Carabobo Field, Carabobo commemorating the memory of national heroes and the fallen of the [[Battle of Carabobo]] of 1821, (ii) at the Montana Barracks in Caracas in memory of the late [[Hugo Chavez|Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]]; and (iii) at the National Pantheon in Caracas in memory of Bol\u00edvar and other national heroes buried there. The brigade also performs public duties functions as required. Brigade personnel come from all branches of the [[National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela]] (NBAF) and public security services. The brigade is commanded by a general or flag officer and includes a Presidential mounted escort of platoon or troop size.\n\nAside from the PHGB, there are two other foot guards battalions in the NBAF, the Caracas Foot Guards Battalion of the Ministry of Defence, and the [[Daniel Florence O'Leary Headquarters Battalion|Brigadier Daniel Florence O'Leary Headquarters and HQ Services Foot Guards Battalion]] of the Venezuelan Army Headquarters.

Guard continues the tradition of Serbian Guard units which is now almost two centuries long. The first Guard unit formed in Serbia was created on the order of Prince Milos Obrenovic on St. George Day in 1830 in Pozarevac. The Guard Unit also sports the official military band of the [[Serbian Armed Forces]] - the [[Serbian Guards Unit Band|Band]].\n\n====Slovakia====\nThe [[Slovak Armed Forces]] currently operates two ceremonial guard of honour units. The ''[[Honour Guard of the President of the Slovak Republic]]'' also known as the ''Presidential Guard'' is the seniormost ceremonial unit in the [[Slovak Armed Forces]], and the primary honour guard unit of the [[President of Slovakia]]. This unit serves under the command of the [[Military Office of the President of the Slovak Republic]].\n[[File:\u010cestn\u00e1 str\u00e1\u017e Ozbrojen\u00fdch s\u00edl SR.jpg|thumb|The Honour Guard of the [[Slovak Armed Forces]] is one of two ceremonial honour guard units in Slovakia.]]\nThe ''Honour Guard Company of the Slovak Armed Forces'' ([[Slovak language|Slovak]]: \u010cestn\u00e1 str\u00e1\u017e Ozbrojen\u00fdch s\u00edl Slovenskej republiky, CS OS SR) is a separate ceremonial honour guard unit of the [[Slovak Armed Forces]], under the direct command of the Bratislava Garrison Headquarters.<ref>https://www.mod.gov.sk/data/disk/casopis/Obrana_10_%202018.pdf</ref> The unit was founded in 2009 as part of reforms in the armed forces.

The regiment's Honour Group and Royal Escort Squadron are its primary ceremonial units. The Royal Escort Squadron provides the ceremonial escort of the Spanish Royal Family and is organized into three units: the Marker Squad, the Cuirassier Troop, and the Lancer Troop.\n\nThe guard of honour is also mounted for state visits. Units which mount the guard for state visits include the [[Spanish Army]]'s ''[[Monteros de Espinosa]]'' (includes three platoons, and a drill team); the ''Mar Oc\u00e9ano'' Navy and Marine Composite Company (includes three platoons); and the ''Plus Ultra'' Air Force Squadron (includes three flights). The [[1st King's Immemorial Infantry Regiment]] maintains a guard of honour unit known as the \"Old Guard of Castille\" Battalion  (''Guardias Viejas de Castilla''). From 1937 to 1956, the [[Guardia Mora]] served as the mounted guard of honour for [[Francoist Spain]], part of a bigger combined arms guard of honour regiment of personnel from service branches of the Armed Forces.\n\n====Sweden====\n[[File:Swedish Life Guard Dragoons serving as drabant guard in the uniform of Charles XI 2.jpg|thumb|left|Swedish [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guard]] Dragoons wearing the uniform of the Charles XI Drabantvakt (royal bodyguard) during an Italian state visit to Sweden.]]\nHonour guard service is carried out by all units of the [[Swedish Armed Forces]], although the [[Life Guards (Sweden)|Life Guards Regiment]] in the [[Swedish Army]] accounts for the main part of honour guard services.

The design of the uniforms of the guard is based on, but not identical to, uniforms used during the reign of Carles XI and Charles XII respectively. The guard consists of 24 soldiers and one officer selected from the Life Guards.<ref>''Instruktion f\u00f6r F\u00f6rsvarsmakten, Ceremonier 2010''.

[[Switzerland]] does not have a professional honour guard unit. The military instead utilizes a battalion-sized capital unit that is used during official visits. Unlike other European countries, Swiss honour guards wear combat uniforms instead of an expected [[full dress uniform]].<ref>https://www.vtg.admin.ch/de/aktuell/themen/internationale-beziehungen/militaerprotokoll/militaerisches_zeremoniell.html</ref>\n\n====Turkey====\n[[File:Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace 6.jpg|thumb|125px|A Turkish Presidential Guard Regiment member at [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]].]]\nSeveral guard detachments operate within the [[Turkish Armed Forces]].

A ''half guard'' is a colloquial term describing a guard of honour of not more than 50 personnel (including two officers, one with a colour).<ref>''RAF Drill and Ceremonial'' AP 818\n7th Edition</ref> A guard of honour could have a single service contingent (e.g. army) or it could be a tri service (inter-service) affair. The guard commander, after saluting the dignitary (usually head of state), marches up to him or her and escorts him or her to inspect the guard (soldiers in formation). During the salute, the national anthems of both the dignitary's country and the host country are usually played by a ceremonial band.\n\nOnly a [[War flag|standard]], [[Guidon (heraldic flag)|guidon]], Queen's Colour, or a [[banner]] presented by either a member of the Royal Family or the governor-general may be carried by a royal guard of honour. Only a regimental colour or a banner presented by a personage other than a member of the Royal Family may be carried on a half guard of honour. A smaller unit honouring distinguished visitors at a military installation is known as a ''quarter guard''. The commander is three paces in front of the second file from the right and accompanies the personage for whom the guard is mounted. An officer carrying the Colour stands three paces in front of the centre; if there is a third officer he will be three paces in front of the second file from the other flank.<ref>p.128 ''Guards of honour'' from ''Ceremonial 1912''</ref>\n\nUnits that traditionally perform ceremonial duties, such as Guard Mounting ([[changing of the Queen's Guard]]) or [[Trooping the Colour]], are the five regiments of Foot Guards and the [[Household Cavalry]] ([[Blues and Royals]] and [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]]), which form the Household Division whilst the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] form the Guard of Honour when foreign Heads of State visit London.<ref>https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/formations-divisions-brigades/force-troops-command/1st-intelligence-surveillance-and-reconnaissance-brigade/honourable-artillery-company/</ref> The [[Royal Air Force]]'s ceremonial unit is the [[Queen's Colour Squadron]].

The players' teammates or opposition form a cordon, with their bats at the second count of the draw saber forming an arch, and the successful player walks through. It may also be performed to mark a milestone, such as when a player breaks a world record. A player can receive guard of honour multiple times as they retire from different forms of the game separately.

Its ceremonial duties are usually performed at government buildings and notable areas in [[Havana]], with the [[Plaza de la Revoluci\u00f3n]] (the main square in the capital) and the [[Palace of the Revolution]] (the workplace of the [[President of Cuba]]). The main purpose of the military unit is the performance of the changing of the guard every half an hour at the Jos\u00e9 Marti Mausoleum in [[Santiago de Cuba]]. Prior to [[Fidel Castro]]'s [[1959 Cuban Revolution]], honour guards were performed by units that resembled honour guard units in the [[United States]], such as [[3rd U.S. Infantry Regiment (The Old Guard)|The Old Guard]].\n\n====Haiti====\nHaitian honour guard duties are performed by the General Security Unit of the National Palace of the [[Haitian National Police]] (L'Unit\u00e9 de S\u00e9curit\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Palais National, USGPN) which is a major specialized unit of the PNH. It has, since 1997, mainly ensured security at the [[National Palace (Haiti)|Palais National]] and the security of the [[President of Haiti]]. The USGPN works with the Presidential Security Unit (Unit\u00e9 de s\u00e9curit\u00e9 pr\u00e9sidentielle, USP) to protect the president, as well as intervene when a crime takes place and or assist police officers in their duties, outside of the USGPN's ceremonial ones.

It is one of two official Household Cavalry and [[Dragoon Guards]] regiments in the army which have the affording of ceremonial protection to the [[President of Peru]] and to the [[Government Palace (Peru)|Government Palace]] in [[Lima]] as their foremost duties. Other units, such as the Jun\u00edn Hussars and the Peruvian Guard Legion Infantry Battalion, also perform public duties in the capital.\n\nThe other services of the [[Peruvian Armed Forces]] have their own dedicated ceremonial units.

The most distant antecedents of the Presidential Honour Guard go back to the Hussars Troop of Simon Bolivar, of the Venezuelan War of Independence and of the larger Spanish American wars of independence, raised in June 1815 and part of a more bigger guards brigade targeted for the immediate security of the Liberator, and the early 20th century 1st Cavalry Regiment \"Ambrosio Plaza\" that until the 1950s, albelt reduced to squadron size, provided the ceremonial security of the President and was modeled on the Prussian horse guards units of the late 19th century. The modern brigade serves as a ceremonial escort to the President of Venezuela at [[Miraflores Palace]] and attends all state arrival ceremonies conducted there, as well as providing security for the palace complex. The brigade also provides honour guards (i) at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Carabobo Field, Carabobo commemorating the memory of national heroes and the fallen of the [[Battle of Carabobo]] of 1821, (ii) at the Montana Barracks in Caracas in memory of the late [[Hugo Chavez|Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]]; and (iii) at the National Pantheon in Caracas in memory of Bol\u00edvar and other national heroes buried there. The brigade also performs public duties functions as required. Brigade personnel come from all branches of the [[National Bolivarian Armed Forces of Venezuela]] (NBAF) and public security services. The brigade is commanded by a general or flag officer and includes a Presidential mounted escort of platoon or troop size.\n\nAside from the PHGB, there are two other foot guards battalions in the NBAF, the Caracas Foot Guards Battalion of the Ministry of Defence, and the [[Daniel Florence O'Leary Headquarters Battalion|Brigadier Daniel Florence O'Leary Headquarters and HQ Services Foot Guards Battalion]] of the Venezuelan Army Headquarters.

Of brigade size, it is under the direct command of the Serbian Armed Forces' Chief of Staff. Its purpose is to guard vital defence facilities and to perform military honours to the highest foreign, domestic, and military officials.\n\nFor the needs of Ministry of Defence and the Serbian Army General Staff, the Guard Unit performs tasks within the scope of the military police work and the tasks in the field of logistics and security. Guard continues the tradition of Serbian Guard units which is now almost two centuries long. The first Guard unit formed in Serbia was created on the order of Prince Milos Obrenovic on St. George Day in 1830 in Pozarevac. The Guard Unit also sports the official military band of the [[Serbian Armed Forces]] - the [[Serbian Guards Unit Band|Band]].\n\n====Slovakia====\nThe [[Slovak Armed Forces]] currently operates two ceremonial guard of honour units. The ''[[Honour Guard of the President of the Slovak Republic]]'' also known as the ''Presidential Guard'' is the seniormost ceremonial unit in the [[Slovak Armed Forces]], and the primary honour guard unit of the [[President of Slovakia]].

The regiment's Honour Group and Royal Escort Squadron are its primary ceremonial units. The Royal Escort Squadron provides the ceremonial escort of the Spanish Royal Family and is organized into three units: the Marker Squad, the Cuirassier Troop, and the Lancer Troop.\n\nThe guard of honour is also mounted for state visits. Units which mount the guard for state visits include the [[Spanish Army]]'s ''[[Monteros de Espinosa]]'' (includes three platoons, and a drill team); the ''Mar Oc\u00e9ano'' Navy and Marine Composite Company (includes three platoons); and the ''Plus Ultra'' Air Force Squadron (includes three flights). The [[1st King's Immemorial Infantry Regiment]] maintains a guard of honour unit known as the \"Old Guard of Castille\" Battalion  (''Guardias Viejas de Castilla'').

[[Switzerland]] does not have a professional honour guard unit. The military instead utilizes a battalion-sized capital unit that is used during official visits. Unlike other European countries, Swiss honour guards wear combat uniforms instead of an expected [[full dress uniform]].<ref>https://www.vtg.admin.ch/de/aktuell/themen/internationale-beziehungen/militaerprotokoll/militaerisches_zeremoniell.html</ref>\n\n====Turkey====\n[[File:Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace 6.jpg|thumb|125px|A Turkish Presidential Guard Regiment member at [[Dolmabah\u00e7e Palace]].]]\nSeveral guard detachments operate within the [[Turkish Armed Forces]].

A ''half guard'' is a colloquial term describing a guard of honour of not more than 50 personnel (including two officers, one with a colour).<ref>''RAF Drill and Ceremonial'' AP 818\n7th Edition</ref> A guard of honour could have a single service contingent (e.g. army) or it could be a tri service (inter-service) affair. The guard commander, after saluting the dignitary (usually head of state), marches up to him or her and escorts him or her to inspect the guard (soldiers in formation). During the salute, the national anthems of both the dignitary's country and the host country are usually played by a ceremonial band.\n\nOnly a [[War flag|standard]], [[Guidon (heraldic flag)|guidon]], Queen's Colour, or a [[banner]] presented by either a member of the Royal Family or the governor-general may be carried by a royal guard of honour. Only a regimental colour or a banner presented by a personage other than a member of the Royal Family may be carried on a half guard of honour. A smaller unit honouring distinguished visitors at a military installation is known as a ''quarter guard''. The commander is three paces in front of the second file from the right and accompanies the personage for whom the guard is mounted. An officer carrying the Colour stands three paces in front of the centre; if there is a third officer he will be three paces in front of the second file from the other flank.<ref>p.128 ''Guards of honour'' from ''Ceremonial 1912''</ref>\n\nUnits that traditionally perform ceremonial duties, such as Guard Mounting ([[changing of the Queen's Guard]]) or [[Trooping the Colour]], are the five regiments of Foot Guards and the [[Household Cavalry]] ([[Blues and Royals]] and [[Life Guards (United Kingdom)|Life Guards]]), which form the Household Division whilst the [[Honourable Artillery Company]] form the Guard of Honour when foreign Heads of State visit London.<ref>https://www.army.mod.uk/who-we-are/formations-divisions-brigades/force-troops-command/1st-intelligence-surveillance-and-reconnaissance-brigade/honourable-artillery-company/</ref> The [[Royal Air Force]]'s ceremonial unit is the [[Queen's Colour Squadron]].

The Army portion of the company is notable for its highly distinctive [[Campaign hat|\"lemon squeezer\" hat]].\n\n==Sports==\n===Association football===\n[[File:Carra - Guard of honour.jpg|thumb|[[Jamie Carragher]] receives a guard of honour before the final match of his career.]]\nIn recent years, [[association football]] teams have shown their respect to teams in their own division which have already won their league title at the end of the season with games to spare by forming a guard of honour onto or off the pitch for their players.{{cn|date=January 2020}} The applauding team forms two lines to make a corridor and the league winners pass through the corridor, generally in single file. The guard of honour is in some instances considered good form to perform but is not considered compulsory and teams may opt not to provide one, as especially tends to happen between teams considered particularly bitter rivals.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport/football/hearts/hibernian-will-not-grant-hearts-a-guard-of-honour-1-3742425 |title=Hibernian will not grant Hearts a guard of honour |work=[[Edinburgh News]] |date=10 April 2015 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe same has occasionally been done for individual players meeting particularly momentous points in their career, such as when Scottish Premier league team [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] squad did so for departing talisman [[Dado Prso]]<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Football%3A+TEARIO+DADO%3B+Prso+breaks+down+as+Gers+stars+give+him+an...-a0163320881 |title=Football: TEARIO DADO; Prso breaks down as Gers stars give him an emotional send-off. |work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]] |date=14 May 2007 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}</ref> and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] controversially<ref name=\"Terry\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/may/22/john-terry-26-guard-of-honour-chelsea-stamford-bridge |title=John Terry\u2019s 26th-minute guard of honour send-off at Chelsea: fair or farce? |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=22 May 2017 |accessdate=29 December 2017}}</ref> chose to do so in a pre-planned display in the middle of a match for [[John Terry]]'s last game, causing significant delays to the game.<ref name=\"Terry\"/>\n\n===Australian rules football===\nIn [[Australian rules football]], players will often form a guard of honour for those who are leaving the field after a landmark game or on their retirement game. For example, Fremantle formed a guard of honour for Fitzroy's last match in 1996. [[Melbourne F.C.|Melbourne]] and [[Essendon F.C.|Essendon]] formed a guard in 2005 to honour [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] victim [[Troy Broadbridge]]. [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] formed a guard of honour in 2006 for retiring player [[Saverio Rocca]], who forged a successful goalkicking career at both clubs.  After playing in the [[little league (Australian rules football)|little league]] at half time of senior matches, the junior players line up to form a guard of honour for when the players return to the field.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://open.abc.net.au/posts/our-sideline-snub-64rk7hp|title=Port Power missed our guard of honour|first= Emma |last=Pedler |date=30 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Cricket===\n\nIn [[cricket]], the guard of honour is used to celebrate the achievement of a player (usually as a [[batsman]]), normally used during a player's final game. The players' teammates or opposition form a cordon, with their bats at the second count of the draw saber forming an arch, and the successful player walks through. It may also be performed to mark a milestone, such as when a player breaks a world record. A player can receive guard of honour multiple times as they retire from different forms of the game separately. When a bowler retires, it would generally be when they leave the field for the final time, or when they play their final match in a certain venue of importance (away match, home ground, retiring on the same day a ground is due to be demolished).\n\n===Field Hockey===\nIn recent times guard of honour is usually done among Hockey players for those who have done something valuable for their country like [[Balbir Singh, Sr]], [[Jamie Dwyer]]\n\n==Doctors & Paramedics==\nFollowing the tribute paid by the [[Sindh]]<ref>{{cite web|author= Fahad Shabbir|url=https://thepakistanpost.net/sukkur-police-presents-guard-of-honor-to-doctors-paramedical-staff/  |title= Sukkur Police presents guard of honor to doctors & paramedical staff|publisher= The Pakistan post|date=28 March 2020 |accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref> and [[Punjab]] Police<ref>{{cite web|author= Aisha Mahmood|url=https://www.brecorder.com/2020/03/27/584069/watch-lahore-police-gives-guard-of-honor-to-medical-staff-combating-coronavirus/|title= Watch: Lahore police gives guard of honor to medical staff combating coronavirus|publisher= Business Recorder|date=27 March 2020|accessdate=28 March 2020}}</ref> [[Balochistan police]] have also presented a guard of honor on 29 March-2020 (local) to the doctors and para medical staff   <ref>{{cite web|author=Naimat Khan |url=https://www.arabnews.pk/node/1648966/pakistan|title=Police present ceremonial salute to medics in Balochistan, Punjab|publisher= Arab News|date=28 March 2020 |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref> fighting on the front lines of the global [[Socio-economic impact of the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|COVID-19 outbreak]] as a mark of respect.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|War}}\n*[[Change of command]]\n*[[Colour guard]]\n*[[Military rites]]\n*[[Vigil of the Princes]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Guard of Honour}}\n[[Category:Association football terminology]]\n[[Category:Australian rules football terminology]]\n[[Category:Military traditions]]\n[[Category:Guards of honour| ]]\n", "name_user": "Kiril kovachev", "label": "safe", "comment": "GB and US instead of \"en-GB\" and \"en-US\".", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guard_of_honour"}
