According to epigraphist [[Iravatham Mahadevan]], this was the first datable artefact bearing the Indus script to be found in Tamil Nadu. According to Mahadevan, the find was evidence of the use of the [[Harappan language]], and therefore that the \"Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a [[Harappan language]]\". The date of the celt was estimated at between 1500 BCE and 2000 BCE. Though this finding remains contested, like the claim of historian Michel Danino who rubbishes the theory of the latter\u2019s southward migration in a paper he presented at the International Symposium on Indus Civilisation and Tamil Language in 2007. He wrote: \u2018There is no archaeological evidence of a southward migration through the Deccan after the end of the urban phase of the Indus Valley Civilisation The only actual evidence of movements at that period is of Late Harappans migrating towards the Ganges plains and towards Gujarat... Migration apart, there is a complete absence of Harappan artefacts and features south of the Vindhyas: no Harappan designs on pottery, no Harappan seals, crafts and ornaments, no trace of Harappan urbanism\u2026 Cultural continuity from Harappan to historical times has been increasingly documented in North India, but not in the South\u2026 This means, in effect, that the south-bound Late Harappans would have reverted from an advanced urban bronze-age culture to a Neolithic one! Their migration to South would thus constitute a double \u201carchaeological miracle\u201d: apart from being undetectable on the ground, it implies that the migrants experienced a total break with all their traditions. Such a phenomenon is unheard of.\u2019\n<ref>{{cite news |title=Significance of Mayiladuthurai find |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article3126838.ece |accessdate=2 April 2016 |work=The Hindu |date=1 May 2006 |language=en-IN |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160101032334/http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article3126838.ece |archive-date=1 January 2016 |url-status=live  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=T|first1=Saravanan|title=How a recent archaeological discovery throws light on the history of Tamil script|url=http://www.thehindu.com/society/10th-century-ce-oil-press-discovered-near-andipatti-with-a-tamil-script/article22814589.ece|date=22 February 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= the eternal harappan script |url= http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/the-eternal-harappan-script-tease |access-date= 24 March 2019 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20190324134658/http://www.openthemagazine.com/article/india/the-eternal-harappan-script-tease |archive-date= 24 March 2019 |url-status=live |df= dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n=== Sangam period (500 BCE \u2013 300 CE) ===\n{{Main|Sangam period|Tamilakam|Sangam landscape}}\n[[File:KeeladiExcavationCamp8.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Keeladi excavation site|Keeladi]], a Sangam Era Excavation Site, [[Sangam period]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/tamil-nadu/keezhadi-excavation-the-story-till-now/article18464920.ece|title=Keezhadi excavation leads to ancient civilisation on the banks of Vaigai|date=16 May 2017|via=www.thehindu.com|newspaper=The Hindu|last2=Sundar|first2=S.|last3=Sundar|first3=S.|last4=Jesudasan|first4=Dennis S.|last5=Jesudasan|first5=Dennis S.|last6=Jesudasan|first6=Dennis S.|last7=Jesudasan|first7=Dennis S.|last8=Shrikumar|first8=A.|last9=Shrikumar|first9=A.|last10=S|first10=Mohamed Imranullah|last11=S|first11=Mohamed Imranullah|last14=b. a|first14=Pon Vasanth|last15=b. a|first15=Pon Vasanth|last16=Kolappan|first16=B.|last17=Kolappan|first17=B.|last18=Kolappan|first18=B.|last19=Kolappan|first19=B.|last20=Saravanan|first20=T.|last21=Saravanan|first21=T.|last22=Annamalai|first22=S.|last23=Annamalai|first23=S.|last24=Shrikumar|first24=A.|last25=Shrikumar|first25=A.|last26=Annamalai|first26=S.|last27=Annamalai|first27=S.|last28=Annamalai|first28=S.|last29=Annamalai|first29=S.|last1=Kavitha|first1=S.

The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 by a confederacy of [[Deccan sultanates]]. Subsequently, as the Vijayanagara Empire went into decline after the mid-16th century, many local rulers, called [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]], succeeded in gaining the trappings of independence. This eventually resulted in the further weakening of the empire; many Nayaks declared themselves independent, among whom the [[Nayaks of Madurai]] and Tanjore were the first to declare their independence, despite initially maintaining loose links with the Vijayanagara kingdom.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|pp=18\u2013182}} The Nayaks of Madurai and [[Nayaks of Thanjavur]] were the most prominent Nayaks of the 17th century.

The fall of the Vijayanagara empire and the Chandragiri Nayakas gave the [[sultanate of Golconda]] a chance to expand into the Tamil heartland. When the sultanate was incorporated into the Mughal Empire in 1688, the northern part of current-day Tamil Nadu was administrated by the [[nawab of the Carnatic]], who had his seat in [[Arcot]] from 1715 onward. Meanwhile, to the south, the fall of the [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] led to a short-lived [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The fall of the [[Madurai Nayaks]] brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called Palayams.

of Tamil Nadu.]]\n\n=== Pre-Independence ===\nPrior to Indian independence Tamil Nadu was under British colonial rule as part of the [[Madras Presidency]]. The main party in Tamil Nadu at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC). [[List of political parties in India|Regional parties]] have dominated state politics since 1916. One of the earliest regional parties, the South Indian Welfare Association, a forerunner to [[Dravidian parties]] in Tamil Nadu, was started in 1916. The party was called after its English organ, [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], by its opponents. Later, [[South Indian Liberal Federation]] was adopted as its official name. The reason for victory of the Justice Party in elections was the non-participation of the INC, demanding complete independence of India.\n\nThe Justice Party which was under [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|E. V. Ramasamy]] was renamed [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] in 1944. It was a non-political party which demanded the establishment of an independent state called [[Dravida Nadu]]. However, due to the differences between its two leaders E. V. Ramasamy and [[C. N. Annadurai]], the party was split.\n\n=== Post-Independence ===\nC. N. Annadurai left the party Dravida Kazhagam to form the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). The DMK decided to enter politics in 1956. After the demise of C. N. Annadurai, [[M.

Its capital and largest city is [[Chennai]]. Tamil Nadu lies in the southernmost part of the [[Indian subcontinent]] and is bordered by the [[union territory]] of [[Puducherry]] and the [[South India]]n states of [[Kerala]], [[Karnataka]], and [[Andhra Pradesh]]. It is bounded by the [[Eastern Ghats]] on the north, by the [[Nilgiri Mountains]], the [[Meghamalai]] Hills, and [[Kerala]] on the west, by the [[Bay of Bengal]] in the east, by the [[Gulf of Mannar]] and the [[Palk Strait]] on the southeast, and by the [[Indian Ocean]] on the south.

According to epigraphist [[Iravatham Mahadevan]], this was the first datable artefact bearing the Indus script to be found in Tamil Nadu. According to Mahadevan, the find was evidence of the use of the [[Harappan language]], and therefore that the \"Neolithic people of the Tamil country spoke a [[Harappan language]]\". The date of the celt was estimated at between 1500 BCE and 2000 BCE. Though this finding remains contested, like the claim of historian Michel Danino who rubbishes the theory of the latter\u2019s southward migration in a paper he presented at the International Symposium on Indus Civilisation and Tamil Language in 2007. He wrote: \u2018There is no archaeological evidence of a southward migration through the Deccan after the end of the urban phase of the Indus Valley Civilisation The only actual evidence of movements at that period is of Late Harappans migrating towards the Ganges plains and towards Gujarat...

The Vijayanagara empire eventually conquered the entire Tamil country by c. 1370 and ruled for almost two centuries until its defeat in the [[Battle of Talikota]] in 1565 by a confederacy of [[Deccan sultanates]]. Subsequently, as the Vijayanagara Empire went into decline after the mid-16th century, many local rulers, called [[Nayak dynasty|Nayaks]], succeeded in gaining the trappings of independence. This eventually resulted in the further weakening of the empire; many Nayaks declared themselves independent, among whom the [[Nayaks of Madurai]] and Tanjore were the first to declare their independence, despite initially maintaining loose links with the Vijayanagara kingdom.{{sfn|Sastri|1970|pp=18\u2013182}} The Nayaks of Madurai and [[Nayaks of Thanjavur]] were the most prominent Nayaks of the 17th century.

The fall of the Vijayanagara empire and the Chandragiri Nayakas gave the [[sultanate of Golconda]] a chance to expand into the Tamil heartland. When the sultanate was incorporated into the Mughal Empire in 1688, the northern part of current-day Tamil Nadu was administrated by the [[nawab of the Carnatic]], who had his seat in [[Arcot]] from 1715 onward. Meanwhile, to the south, the fall of the [[Thanjavur Nayaks]] led to a short-lived [[Thanjavur Maratha kingdom]]. The fall of the [[Madurai Nayaks]] brought up many small Nayakars of southern Tamil Nadu, who ruled small parcels of land called Palayams. The chieftains of these Palayams were known as [[Palaiyakkarar]] (or 'polygar' as called by British) and were ruling under the nawabs of the Carnatic.\n\n[[File:Fort Dansborg.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Fort Dansborg]] at [[Tharangambadi]] built by the [[Danes|Danish]]]]\nEuropeans started to establish trade centres during the 17th century in the eastern coastal regions.

In 1969, Madras State was renamed Tamil Nadu, meaning \"Tamil country\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Migrant women and urban labour market: concepts and case studies |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=uMlVGtjbcSIC&pg=PA105&dq=madras+state+became+Tamilnadu#v=onepage&q=madras%20state%20became%20Tamilnadu&f=false|isbn=9788176299664 |last1=Sundari |first1=Dr. S. |year=2007 }}</ref>\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Tamil Nadu topo deutsch mit Gebirgen.png|thumb|upright=0.9|Topographic map of Tamil Nadu]]\n[[File:Western Ghats Gobi.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Western Ghats]] traverse along the western border of Tamil Nadu]]{{Main|Geography of Tamil Nadu}}\nTamil Nadu covers an area of {{convert|130058|sqkm|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and is the tenth largest state in India. The bordering states are [[Kerala]] to the west, [[Karnataka]] to the north west and [[Andhra Pradesh]] to the north. To the east is the [[Bay of Bengal]] and the state encircles the [[union territory]] of [[Puducherry]]. The southernmost tip of the Indian Peninsula is [[Kanyakumari (town)|Kanyakumari]] which is the meeting point of the [[Arabian Sea]], the Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean.\n\nThe western, southern and the northwestern parts are hilly and rich in vegetation. The [[Western Ghats]] and the [[Eastern Ghats]] meet at the [[Nilgiri hills]]. The Western Ghats traverse the entire western border with Kerala, effectively blocking much of the rain bearing clouds of the south west monsoon from entering the state. The eastern parts are fertile coastal plains and the northern parts are a mix of hills and plains. The central and the south central regions are arid plains and receive less rainfall than the other regions.\n\nTamil Nadu has the country's third longest [[Coastline of Tamil Nadu|coastline]] at about {{convert|906.9|km|mi|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mha1.nic.in/par2013/par2013-pdfs/ls-300413/498.pdf|title=Indian States by Coastline|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170828221126/http://mha1.nic.in/par2013/par2013-pdfs/ls-300413/498.pdf|archive-date=28 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> Tamil Nadu's coastline bore the brunt of the 2004 [[Indian Ocean tsunami]] when it hit India, which caused 7,793 direct deaths in the state. Tamil Nadu falls mostly in a region of low seismic hazard with the exception of the western border areas that lie in a low to moderate hazard zone; as per the 2002 Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) map, Tamil Nadu falls in zones II and III. Historically, parts of this region have experienced seismic activity in the M5.0 range.{{sfn|Amateur Seismic Centre|2007}}\n\n=== Climate ===\nTamil Nadu is mostly dependent on monsoon rains, and thereby is prone to droughts when the monsoons fail. The climate of the state ranges from dry sub-humid to semi-arid. The state has two distinct periods of rainfall:\n* [[Monsoon|South west monsoon]] from June to September, with strong southwest winds;\n* [[Monsoon#Late in Year|North east monsoon]] from October to December, with dominant northeast winds;\n\nThe annual rainfall of the state is about {{convert|945|mm|in|abbr=on}} of which 48 per cent is through the north east monsoon, and 32 percent through the south west monsoon. Since the state is entirely dependent on rains for recharging its water resources, monsoon failures lead to acute [[water scarcity]] and [[2016\u201317 Drought in Tamil Nadu|severe drought]].{{sfn|UN, system of organisations|2012}} Tamil Nadu is divided into seven agro-climatic zones: north east, north west, west, southern, high rainfall, high altitude hilly, and [[Kaveri]] Delta (the most fertile agricultural zone).\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{Main|Wildlife of Tamil Nadu|List of birds of Tamil Nadu}}\nThere are about 2,000 species of wildlife that are native to Tamil Nadu. Protected areas provide safe habitat for large mammals including [[Indian elephant|elephants]], [[Bengal tiger|tigers]], [[Indian leopard|leopards]], [[Dhole|wild dogs]], [[sloth bear]]s, [[gaur]]s, [[lion-tailed macaque]]s, [[Nilgiri langur]]s, [[Nilgiri tahr]]s, [[grizzled giant squirrel]]s and [[sambar deer]], resident and migratory birds such as [[cormorant]]s, [[darter]]s, [[heron]]s, [[egret]]s, [[Asian openbill stork|open-billed storks]], [[spoonbill]]s and [[black-headed ibis|white ibises]], [[little grebe]]s, [[common moorhen#Eurasian common moorhen|Indian moorhen]], [[black-winged stilt]]s, a few migratory [[duck]]s and occasionally [[Pelecanus philippensis|grey pelicans]], marine species such as the [[dugong]]s, turtles, dolphins, ''[[Balanoglossus]]'' and a wide variety of fish and insects.\n\nIndian [[Angiosperm]] diversity comprises 17,672 species with Tamil Nadu leading all states in the country, with 5640 species accounting for 1/3 of the total flora of India. This includes 1,559 species of [[medicinal plant]]s, 533 [[endemism|endemic]] species, 260 species of wild relatives of cultivated plants and 230 [[red-listed]] species. The [[gymnosperm]] diversity of the country is 64 species of which Tamil Nadu has four indigenous species and about 60 introduced species. The [[Pteridophyte]]s diversity of India includes 1,022 species of which Tamil Nadu has about 184 species. Vast numbers of [[bryophyte]]s, [[lichen]], fungi, [[algae]] and bacteria are among the wild plant diversity of Tamil Nadu.\n\nCommon plant species include the state tree: [[Borassus flabellifer#Cultural symbolism|palmyra palm]], [[eucalyptus]], rubber, [[cinchona]], clumping bamboos (''[[Bambusa]] arundinacea''), [[Tectona grandis|common teak]], ''[[Anogeissus latifolia]]'', [[Terminalia tomentosa|Indian laurel]], [[grewia]], and blooming trees like [[Cassia fistula|Indian labumusum]], [[ardisia]], and [[solanaceae]].

To protect this diversity of wildlife there are [[Protected areas]] of Tamil Nadu as well as [[Biosphere reserves of India|biospheres]] which protect larger areas of natural habitat often include one or more national parks. The [[Gulf of Mannar Biosphere Reserve]] established in 1986 is a marine ecosystem with seaweed seagrass communities, coral reefs, salt marshes and mangrove forests. The [[Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve]] located in the [[Western Ghats]] and [[Nilgiri Hills]] comprises part of adjoining states of Kerala and Karnataka. The [[Agasthyamala Biosphere Reserve]] is in the south west of the state bordering Kerala in the Western Ghats.

The main party in Tamil Nadu at that time was the [[Indian National Congress]] (INC). [[List of political parties in India|Regional parties]] have dominated state politics since 1916. One of the earliest regional parties, the South Indian Welfare Association, a forerunner to [[Dravidian parties]] in Tamil Nadu, was started in 1916. The party was called after its English organ, [[Justice Party (India)|Justice Party]], by its opponents. Later, [[South Indian Liberal Federation]] was adopted as its official name. The reason for victory of the Justice Party in elections was the non-participation of the INC, demanding complete independence of India.\n\nThe Justice Party which was under [[Periyar E. V. Ramasamy|E. V. Ramasamy]] was renamed [[Dravidar Kazhagam]] in 1944. It was a non-political party which demanded the establishment of an independent state called [[Dravida Nadu]]. However, due to the differences between its two leaders E. V. Ramasamy and [[C. N. Annadurai]], the party was split.\n\n=== Post-Independence ===\nC. N. Annadurai left the party Dravida Kazhagam to form the [[Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (DMK). The DMK decided to enter politics in 1956. After the demise of C. N. Annadurai, [[M. Karunanidhi]] became the leader of the party which was supported by majority leaders including then famous actor [[M. G. Ramachandran]]. As a breakaway faction of the DMK. In 1972, M. G. Ramachandran founded the new dravidan party [[All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam]] (AIADMK) named after his political mentor C. N.

Originally built for the [[Cunard Line]], ''QE2'' was operated by Cunard as both a transatlantic liner and a cruise ship from 1969 to 2008. It was then laid up until converted and since 18 April 2018, she has been operating as a floating hotel in [[Dubai]].<ref>https://chrisframe.com.au/post/172795288690/qe2-reopens-asa-hotel-in-dubai-on-april-18-after-9 QE2 reopens after 9 1/2 years</ref>\n\n''QE2'' was designed for the transatlantic service from her home port of [[Port of Southampton|Southampton]], UK to New York, United States<ref>https://chrisframe.com.au/post/184591429680/50th-anniversary-of-qe2-today-2-may-2019-marks QE2 50th Anniversary by Chris Frame.</ref> and was named after the earlier Cunard liner {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}. She served as the flagship of the line from 1969 until succeeded by {{RMS|Queen Mary 2}} in 2004. ''QE2'' was designed in Cunard's offices in Liverpool and Southampton and built in [[Clydebank]], Scotland. She was considered the last of the transatlantic ocean liners until ''Queen Mary 2'' entered service.\n\n''QE2'' was also the last oil-fired passenger steamship to cross the Atlantic in scheduled liner service until she was refitted with a modern diesel powerplant in 1986\u201387. She undertook regular world cruises during almost 40 years of service, and later operated predominantly as a cruise ship, sailing out of [[Southampton]], England. ''QE2'' had no running mate and never ran a year-round weekly transatlantic express service to New York. She did, however, continue the Cunard tradition of regular scheduled transatlantic crossings every year of her service life. \n\n''QE2'' was retired from active Cunard service on 27 November 2008. She had been acquired by the private equity arm of [[Dubai World]], which planned to begin conversion of the vessel to a 500-room floating hotel moored at the [[Palm Jumeirah]], Dubai.<ref name=asa>{{cite news|last=Fitch|first=Asa|title=QE II Ocean Liner Heads to Asia to Become Floating Hotel|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/QE_II_Ocean_Liner_heads_to_Asia_to_become_floating_hotel-ZW20130117000111/|newspaper=Zawya|date=19 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Cunard Press Release\">{{cite web|url= http://www.cunard.com/AboutCunard/NewsReleases.asp?Cat=&View=ViewArticle&Mode=News&ContentID=6656&Active=News |publisher=Cunard.com|title=QE2 To Leave Cunard Fleet And Be Sold To Dubai World To Begin A New Life At The Palm|year=2007|accessdate=20 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706160214/http://www.cunard.com/AboutCunard/NewsReleases.asp?Cat%3D%26View%3DViewArticle%26Mode%3DNews%26ContentID%3D6656%26Active%3DNews <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=6 July 2007}}</ref> The [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]] intervened, however, and the ship was laid up at Dubai Drydocks and later Port Rashid.<ref name=\"CLYDE\">{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Hugh|title='Forlorn' QE2 is not coming home from Dubai, campaigners concede|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/12097316/Forlorn-QE2-is-not-coming-home-from-Dubai-campaigners-concede.html|accessdate=18 January 2016|publisher=Teleegraph Media Group|date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Subsequent conversion plans were announced in 2012<ref>{{cite news|title=Cruise liner Queen Elizabeth 2 to be converted into hotel |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/cruise-liner-queen-elizabeth-2-to-be-converted-into-hotel/article1-902010.aspx |accessdate=29 August 2015 |publisher=HT Media Limited |date=3 July 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904050816/http://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/cruise-liner-queen-elizabeth-2-to-be-converted-into-hotel/article1-902010.aspx |archivedate=4 September 2015 }}</ref> and then again by the ''Oceanic Group'' in 2013,<ref>{{cite news|title=New home for Queen Elizabeth 2|url=http://travel.cnn.com/new-home-queen-elizabeth-2-764401|accessdate=18 January 2016|publisher=CNN International|date=18 January 2013}}</ref> but both plans stalled.

Instead, the funnel was painted white and black, with the Cunard orange-red appearing only on the inside of the wind scoop. This practice ended in 1983 when ''QE2'' returned from service in the [[Falklands War]], and the funnel has been repainted in Cunard traditional colours (orange and black), with black horizontal bands (known as \"hands\") ever since.\n\nThe original pencil-like funnel was rebuilt in 1986 as a more robust one, using metal from the original, when the ship was converted from steam to [[Diesel engine|diesel]] power.\n\nLarge quantities of aluminium were used in the framing and cladding of ''QE2''{{'}}s superstructure. This decision was designed to save weight, reducing the draft of the ship and lowering the fuel consumption, but it also posed the possibility of corrosion problems that can occur with joining the dissimilar metals together, so a jointing compound was coated between the steel and aluminium surfaces to prevent this happening. The low melting point of aluminium caused concern when ''QE2'' was serving as a troop ship during the [[Falklands War]]: some feared that if the ship were struck by a missile her upper decks would collapse quickly due to fire, thereby causing greater casualties.\n\nIn 1972, the first penthouse suites were added in an aluminium structure on Signal Deck and Sports Deck (now \"Sun Deck\"), behind the ship's [[Bridge (ship)|bridge]], and in 1977 this structure was expanded to include more suites with balconies, making ''QE2'' one of the first ships to offer private terraces to passengers since ''Normandie'' in the 1930s.\n\n''QE2''{{'}}s balcony accommodation was expanded for the final time during ''QE2''{{'}}s 1986/87 refurbishment in [[Bremerhaven]]. During this refit the ship was given a new wider funnel built using panels from the original. It retained the traditional Cunard colours. \n\n''QE2''{{'}}s final structural changes included the reworking of the aft decks during the 1994 refit (following the removal of the magrodome), and the addition of an undercover area on Sun Deck during her 2005 refit, creating a space known as Funnel Bar.\n\n===Interiors===\n''Queen Elizabeth 2''{{'}}s interior configuration was laid out in a horizontal fashion, similar to ''France'', where the spaces dedicated to the two classes were spread horizontally on specific decks, in contrast to the vertical class divisions of older liners. Where ''QE2'' differed from ''France'' was that the first class deck (Quarter Deck) was below the deck dedicated to tourist class (Upper Deck). Originally there were to be main lounges serving three classes, layered one atop the other, but when Cunard decided to make the ship a two class vessel, only two main lounges were needed.\n\nInstead of completely reconfiguring the Boat Deck, the ship's architects simply opened a well in the deck between what were to have been the second and third class lounges, creating a double height space known as the Double Room (now the Grand Lounge). This too was unconventional in that it designated a grander two-storey space for tourist class passengers, while first class passengers gathered in the standard height Queen's Room. The configuration for segregated Atlantic crossings gave first class passengers the theatre balcony on Boat Deck, while tourist class used the orchestra level on Upper Deck.\n\nOver the span of her thirty-nine-year seagoing career, ''QE2'' received a number of interior refits and alterations.\n\nThe year she came into service, 1969, was also the year of the [[Apollo 11]] mission, when the [[Concorde]]'s prototype was unveiled, and the previous year [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' premiered. In keeping with those times, originally Cunard broke from the traditional interiors of their previous liners for ''QE2'', especially the [[Art Deco]] style of the previous ''Queens''. Instead modern materials like [[Laminate|plastic laminates]], aluminium and [[Perspex]] were used. The public rooms featured glass, stainless steel, dark carpeting and sea green leather.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Cunard Queens Queen Mary 2 Queen Victoria Queen Elizabeth 2 |last=Schwerdtner|first=Nils |publisher=Seaforth Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84832-010-9|location=47 Church Street|pages=27\u201328|via=}}</ref> Furniture was modular and [[abstract art]] was used throughout public rooms and cabins.\n\n[[Dennis Lennon]] was responsible for co-ordinating the interior design, and his team included [[Jon Bannenberg]] and [[Gaby Schreiber]], although Lennon's original designs only remained intact for three years.<ref name=\"scotsman.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/art/sixties-splendour-revived-as-exhibition-celebrates-qe2-formica-fest-1-4687051|title=Sixties splendour revived as exhibition celebrates QE2 Formica fest|author=|date=|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Midships Lobby on Two Deck, where first class passengers boarded for transatlantic journeys and all passengers boarded for cruises, was a circular room with a sunken seating area in the centre with green leather clad banquettes, and surrounded by a chrome railing. As a kingpin to this was a flared, white, trumpet shaped, up lit column.\n\nAnother room, designed by [[Michael Inchbald]], where ''QE2''{{'}}s advanced interior design was demonstrated was the first class lounge, the Queen's Room on Quarter Deck. This space, in colours of white and tan, featured a lowered ceiling with large indirectly lit slots, which, despite reducing the ceiling height, created an impression of airy openness above to deal with the otherwise oppressive dimensions of the single storey room (c. 30m x 30m x 2.4m). In addition the structural columns were flared at the top to blend into the ceiling and to lose the visual indication of low ceiling height that straight columns would have given. (The Midships Lobby copied these features but without achieving the airiness.) Inchbald repeated the flaring of the columns in the bases of his tables and leather shell chairs. The indirect lighting from above could be switched from a cool hue for summer to a warm hue for winter.<ref>Explained to the author by his father, Michael Inchbald</ref>\n\nThe Theatre Bar on Upper Deck featured red chairs, red drapes, a red egg crate fibreglass screen, and even a red baby [[grand piano]]. Some more traditional materials like wood veneer were used as highlights throughout the ship, especially in passenger corridors and staterooms. There was also an Observation Bar on Quarter Deck, a successor to its namesake, located in a similar location, on both previous ''Queens'', which offered views through large windows over the ship's bow. This room was lost in ''QE2''{{'}}s 1972 refit, becoming galley space with the forward-facing windows plated over.\n\nIn the 1994 refit, almost all of the remaining original decor was replaced, with Cunard opting to reverse the original design direction of ''QE2''{{'}}s designers and use the line's traditional ocean liners as inspiration. The green velvet and leather Midships Bar became the [[Art Deco]] inspired Chart Room, receiving an original, custom designed piano from ''Queen Mary''. The (by now) blue dominated Theatre Bar was transformed into the Golden Lion Pub, which mimics a traditional [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] pub.\n\nSome original elements were retained including the flared columns in the Queens Room and Mid-Ships Lobby which were incorporated into the reworked designs. The Queen's Room's indirect lighting from above was replaced with uplighters which reversed the original light airy effect by illuminating the lowered ceiling and leaving shadows in the ceiling's slot. The furniture and carpet which replaced Michael Inchbald's designs were incongruous next to the flared columns and slotted ceiling.\n\nBy the time of her retirement, the Synagogue was the only room that had remained unaltered since 1969.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://members.tripod.com/~Tziper/today.htm | title=Queen Elizabeth 2: Today |publisher=Members.tripod.com |accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref> However it was reported that during ''QE2''{{'}}s 22 October five night voyage, the Synagogue was carefully dismantled before being removed from the ship prior to her final sailing to Dubai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelserver.net/travelpage/ubb-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=3&t=004606 |title=Cruise Talk&nbsp;\u2013 Topic: QE2's Synagogue dismantled |publisher=Travelserver.net |accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Artwork and artefacts===\n[[File:QE2 bell.jpg|thumb|''QE2'' bell on display on the {{MS|Queen Elizabeth}}]]\nThe designers included numerous pieces of artwork within the public rooms of the ship, as well as maritime artefacts drawn from Cunard's long history of operating merchant vessels.\n\n[[Althea Wynne]]\u2019s sculpture of the ''White Horses'' of the Atlantic Ocean was installed in the Mauretania Restaurant.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/9082747/Althea-Wynne.html Althea Wynne (obituary)] in [[The Daily Telegraph]] dated 14 February 2012, online at telegraph.co.uk.

A frieze designed by Brody Nevenshwander, depicting the words of [[T. S. Eliot]], Sir [[Francis Drake]], and [[John Masefield]], was in the Chart Room. The Midships Lobby housed a solid silver model of ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' made by Asprey of Bond Street in 1975, which was lost until a photograph found in 1997 led to the discovery of the model itself. It was placed on ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' in 1999.\n\nThree custom-designed tapestries were commissioned from [[Helena Hernmarck]] for the ship\u2019s launch, depicting the Queen as well as the launch of the ship. These tapestries were originally hung in the Quarter Deck \"D\" Stairway, outside the Columbia Restaurant. They were originally made with golden threads, but much of this was lost when they were incorrectly cleaned during the 1987 refit. They were subsequently hung in the \"E\" stairway, and later damaged in 2005.\n\nThere are numerous photographs, oils, and pastels of members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] throughout the vessel.\n\nThe ship also housed items from previous Cunard ships, including both a brass relief plaque with a fish motif from the first {{RMS|Mauretania|1906}} and an Art-Deco bas-relief titled ''Winged Horse and Clouds'' by Norman Foster from [[RMS Queen Elizabeth]]. There were also a vast array of Cunard postcards, porcelain, flatware, boxes, linen, and [[Lines Bros]] Tri-ang Minic model ships. One of the key pieces was a replica of the [[figurehead]] from Cunard's first ship [[RMS Britannia]], carved from [[Quebec]] yellow pine by [[Cornwall|Cornish]] sculptor Charles Moore and presented to the ship by [[Lloyd's of London]].\n\nOn the Upper Deck sits the silver Boston Commemorative Cup, presented to ''Britannia'' by the City of Boston in 1840. This cup was lost for decades until it was found in a pawn shop in Halifax, Nova Scotia. On \"2\" Deck was a bronze entitled ''Spirit of the Atlantic'' that was designed by Barney Seale for the second {{RMS|Mauretania|1938}}. A large wooden plaque was presented to ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' by [[First Sea Lord]] Sir [[John Fieldhouse, Baron Fieldhouse|John Fieldhouse]] to commemorate the ship's service as a Hired Military Transport (HMT) in the [[Falklands War]].\n\nThere was also an extensive collection of large-scale models of Cunard ships located throughout ''Queen Elizabeth 2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magwa.co.uk/qe2/qe2prt01.htm |title=Interiors of QE2 following The Cunard Heritage Trail in part |publisher=Magwa.co.uk |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nOver the years the ship's collection was added to.

The turbines were rated with a maximum power output figure of 110,000 shaft horsepower (normally operating at 94,000&nbsp;hp) and coupled via double-reduction gearing to two six-bladed fixed-pitch [[propeller]]s.\n\nThe steam turbines were plagued with problems{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} from the time the ship first entered service and, despite being technically advanced and fuel-efficient in 1968, her consumption of 600 tons of fuel oil every twenty four hours was more than expected for such a ship by the 1980s. After seventeen years of service the availability of spare parts was becoming difficult due to the outdated design of the boilers and turbines and the constant use of the machinery which was mainly due to the deletion of the originally planned 4th boiler as a cost saving measure whilst on the drawing board by Cunard.\n\nThe shipping company decided that the options were to either do nothing for the remainder of the ship's life, re-configure the existing engines, or completely re-engine the vessel with a modern, more efficient and more reliable diesel-electric powerplant. Ultimately it was decided to replace the engines, as it was calculated that the savings in fuel costs and maintenance would pay for themselves over four years whilst giving the vessel a minimum of another twenty years of service, whereas the other options would only provide short-term relief.<ref name=\"Rob Lightbody\">{{cite web| url=http://www.roblightbody.com/liners/qe-2/1987_Refit/ |publisher=Rob Lightbody |title=QE2's Major 1986\u20131987 re-engining refit |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> Her steam turbines had taken her to a record breaking total of 2,622,858 miles in 18 years.<ref name=\"The Cunarders\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/QE2%20History.html |publisher=The Cunarders |title=The Cunarders QE2 History |accessdate=23 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213081103/http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/QE2%20History.html |archive-date=13 December 2010 |url-status=dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the ship's 1986 to 1987 refit, the steam turbines were removed and replaced with nine German [[MAN SE|MAN]] 9L58/64 nine-cylinder, medium-speed diesel engines, each weighing approximately 120 tons. Using a diesel-electric configuration, each engine drives a generator, each developing 10.5 MW of electrical power at 10,000 volts. This electrical plant, in addition to powering the ship's auxiliary and hotel services through transformers, drives the two main propulsion motors, one on each propeller shaft. These motors produce 44 MW each and are of synchronised salient-pole construction, nine metres in diameter and weighing more than 400 tons each.\n\nThe ship's service speed of {{convert|28.5|kn|km/h}} was now maintained using only seven of the diesel-electric sets. The maximum power output with the new engine configuration running increased to 130,000&nbsp;hp, which was greater than the previous system's 110,000&nbsp;hp. Using the same IBF-380 ([[Bunker C]]) fuel, the new configuration yielded a 35% fuel saving over the previous system. During the re-engining process, her funnel was replaced by a wider one to accommodate the exhaust pipes for the nine MAN diesel engines.\n\nDuring the refit, the original fixed-pitch propellers were replaced with [[controllable-pitch propeller|variable-pitch propellers]]. The old steam propulsion system required astern turbines to move the ship backwards or stop her moving forward. The pitch of the new variable pitch blades could simply be reversed, causing a reversal of propeller thrust while maintaining the same direction of propeller rotation, allowing the ship shorter stopping times and improved handling characteristics.\n\nThe new propellers were originally fitted with \"Grim Wheels\", named after their inventor, Dr. Ing Otto Grim.<ref name=\"Rob Lightbody\"/> These were free-spinning propeller blades fitted behind the main propellers, with long vanes protruding from the centre hub. The Grim Wheels were designed to recover lost propeller thrust and reduce fuel consumption by 2.5 to 3%. After the trial of these wheels, when the ship was drydocked, the majority of the vanes on each wheel were discovered to have broken off. The wheels were removed and the project abandoned.\n\nOther machinery includes nine heat recovery boilers, coupled with two oil-fired boilers to produce steam for heating fuel, domestic water, swimming pools, laundry equipment, and galleys. Four flash evaporators and a reverse-osmosis unit desalinate sea water to produce 1000 tons of fresh water daily. There is also a sanitation system and sewage disposal plant, air conditioning plant, and an electro-hydraulic steering system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qe2.org.uk/engine.html |title=The engine room |publisher=QE2 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nOn 30 December 1964, Cunard placed an order for construction of the new ship with [[John Brown and Company]], who would build it at their shipyard in [[Clydebank]], Scotland. The agreed price was \u00a325,427,000 with provision for escalation of labour and materials increases, with an agreed delivery date of May 1968.<ref name=\"PayneP33\">Payne. Page 33.</ref> To assist with its construction the British government provided financial assistance to Cunard in the form of a \u00a317.6 million loan at 4.5% interest.<ref name=PayneP33/>\n\nThe keel was laid down on 5 July 1965, as hull number 736 on the same slipway where previous Cunard liners such as {{RMS|Lusitania|3=2}}, {{RMS|Aquitania|3=2}}, ''Queen Mary'', and ''Queen Elizabeth'' had been constructed.\n\nAs construction continued on the new ship, Cunard found itself in increasing financial difficulties as increased competition from airlines resulted in the company's passenger ships losing money. With profits from its cargo ships eventually unable to offset the losses, Cunard was forced to sell ''Mauretania'', ''Sylvania'', ''Carinthia'', ''Caronia'', ''Queen Mary'' and ''Queen Elizabeth'' between 1965 and 1968. Income also fell due to a seven-week-long seamans' strike in 1966.<ref name=PayneP33/> Then John Brown advised that the delivery would be delayed by six months, which meant the ship would miss the 1968 peak summer transatlantic season. Following market research Cunard decided to take advantage of the delay to change the original three-class configuration of the ship to a more flexible two-class arrangement of First and Tourist.<ref name=PayneP33/>\n\nOn 20 September 1967 with the launch date approaching, Cunard (having lost \u00a37.5 million the previous year) approached the government with a request for an additional \u00a33 million loan to complete the ship.<ref name=PayneP33/> Eventually the government agreed to increase the original \u00a317.6 million loan up to \u00a324 million.<ref>Glen.

According to the book \"The Angel\" by [[Uri Bar-Joseph]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]] ordered a submarine to torpedo her during one of the chartered cruises in retaliation for Israel's downing of [[Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114|Libyan Flight 114]], but [[Anwar Sadat]] intervened secretly to foil the attack.\n\nOn 23 July 1976 while ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was 80 miles off the Scilly Isles on a transatlantic voyage, a flexible coupling drive connecting the starboard main engine high pressure rotor and the reduction gear box ruptured. This allowed lubricating oil under pressure to enter into the main engine room where it ignited, creating a severe fire. It took 20 minutes to bring the fire under control. Reduced down to two boilers, the ship limped back to Southampton. Damage from the fire resulted in a replacement boiler having to be fitted by dry-docking the ship and cutting an access hole in her side.<ref name=PayneP36/>\n\nBy 1978 ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was breaking even with an occupancy of 65%, generating revenues of greater than 30 million per year against which had to be deducted an annual fuel cost of \u00a35 million and a monthly crew cost of \u00a3225,000. With it costing \u00a380,000 a day for her to sit idle in port, her owners made every attempt to keep her at sea and full of passengers. As a result, as much maintenance as possible was undertaken while at sea. However, she needed all three of her boilers to be in service if she was to maintain her transatlantic schedule. With limited ability to maintain her boilers, reliability was becoming a serious issue.<ref>Payne.

Boiler problems caused Cunard to cancel a cruise, and, in October 1984, an electrical fire caused a complete loss of power. The ship was delayed for several days before power could be restored. Instead of replacing the QE2 with a newer vessel, Cunard decided that it was more prudent to simply make improvements to her. Therefore, from 27 October 1986 to 25 April 1987,<ref name=PayneP36/> ''QE2'' underwent one of her most significant refurbishments when she was converted by Lloyd Werft at their shipyard in Bremerhaven, Germany from steam power to diesel.<ref name=\"chrisqe2hist\" /><ref name=PayneP38/> Nine [[MAN B&W]] diesel electric engines, new propellers and a heat recovery system (to utilise heat expelled by the engines) were fitted, which halved the fuel consumption.

Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II moved to the front of the launching platform and was handed an envelope by John Rannie with the name of the ship inside.

Originally built for the [[Cunard Line]], ''QE2'' was operated by Cunard as both a transatlantic liner and a cruise ship from 1969 to 2008. It was then laid up until converted and since 18 April 2018, she has been operating as a floating hotel in [[Dubai]].<ref>https://chrisframe.com.au/post/172795288690/qe2-reopens-asa-hotel-in-dubai-on-april-18-after-9 QE2 reopens after 9 1/2 years</ref>\n\n''QE2'' was designed for the transatlantic service from her home port of [[Port of Southampton|Southampton]], UK to New York, United States<ref>https://chrisframe.com.au/post/184591429680/50th-anniversary-of-qe2-today-2-may-2019-marks QE2 50th Anniversary by Chris Frame.</ref> and was named after the earlier Cunard liner {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}. She served as the flagship of the line from 1969 until succeeded by {{RMS|Queen Mary 2}} in 2004. ''QE2'' was designed in Cunard's offices in Liverpool and Southampton and built in [[Clydebank]], Scotland. She was considered the last of the transatlantic ocean liners until ''Queen Mary 2'' entered service.\n\n''QE2'' was also the last oil-fired passenger steamship to cross the Atlantic in scheduled liner service until she was refitted with a modern diesel powerplant in 1986\u201387. She undertook regular world cruises during almost 40 years of service, and later operated predominantly as a cruise ship, sailing out of [[Southampton]], England. ''QE2'' had no running mate and never ran a year-round weekly transatlantic express service to New York. She did, however, continue the Cunard tradition of regular scheduled transatlantic crossings every year of her service life. \n\n''QE2'' was retired from active Cunard service on 27 November 2008. She had been acquired by the private equity arm of [[Dubai World]], which planned to begin conversion of the vessel to a 500-room floating hotel moored at the [[Palm Jumeirah]], Dubai.<ref name=asa>{{cite news|last=Fitch|first=Asa|title=QE II Ocean Liner Heads to Asia to Become Floating Hotel|url=http://www.zawya.com/story/QE_II_Ocean_Liner_heads_to_Asia_to_become_floating_hotel-ZW20130117000111/|newspaper=Zawya|date=19 January 2013}}</ref><ref name=\"Cunard Press Release\">{{cite web|url= http://www.cunard.com/AboutCunard/NewsReleases.asp?Cat=&View=ViewArticle&Mode=News&ContentID=6656&Active=News |publisher=Cunard.com|title=QE2 To Leave Cunard Fleet And Be Sold To Dubai World To Begin A New Life At The Palm|year=2007|accessdate=20 June 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070706160214/http://www.cunard.com/AboutCunard/NewsReleases.asp?Cat%3D%26View%3DViewArticle%26Mode%3DNews%26ContentID%3D6656%26Active%3DNews <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=6 July 2007}}</ref> The [[Financial crisis of 2007\u201308|2008 financial crisis]] intervened, however, and the ship was laid up at Dubai Drydocks and later Port Rashid.<ref name=\"CLYDE\">{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Hugh|title='Forlorn' QE2 is not coming home from Dubai, campaigners concede|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/travelnews/12097316/Forlorn-QE2-is-not-coming-home-from-Dubai-campaigners-concede.html|accessdate=18 January 2016|publisher=Teleegraph Media Group|date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Subsequent conversion plans were announced in 2012<ref>{{cite news|title=Cruise liner Queen Elizabeth 2 to be converted into hotel |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/cruise-liner-queen-elizabeth-2-to-be-converted-into-hotel/article1-902010.aspx |accessdate=29 August 2015 |publisher=HT Media Limited |date=3 July 2012 |url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150904050816/http://www.hindustantimes.com/travel/cruise-liner-queen-elizabeth-2-to-be-converted-into-hotel/article1-902010.aspx |archivedate=4 September 2015 }}</ref> and then again by the ''Oceanic Group'' in 2013,<ref>{{cite news|title=New home for Queen Elizabeth 2|url=http://travel.cnn.com/new-home-queen-elizabeth-2-764401|accessdate=18 January 2016|publisher=CNN International|date=18 January 2013}}</ref> but both plans stalled.

Instead, the funnel was painted white and black, with the Cunard orange-red appearing only on the inside of the wind scoop. This practice ended in 1983 when ''QE2'' returned from service in the [[Falklands War]], and the funnel has been repainted in Cunard traditional colours (orange and black), with black horizontal bands (known as \"hands\") ever since.\n\nThe original pencil-like funnel was rebuilt in 1986 as a more robust one, using metal from the original, when the ship was converted from steam to [[Diesel engine|diesel]] power.\n\nLarge quantities of aluminium were used in the framing and cladding of ''QE2''{{'}}s superstructure. This decision was designed to save weight, reducing the draft of the ship and lowering the fuel consumption, but it also posed the possibility of corrosion problems that can occur with joining the dissimilar metals together, so a jointing compound was coated between the steel and aluminium surfaces to prevent this happening. The low melting point of aluminium caused concern when ''QE2'' was serving as a troop ship during the [[Falklands War]]: some feared that if the ship were struck by a missile her upper decks would collapse quickly due to fire, thereby causing greater casualties.\n\nIn 1972, the first penthouse suites were added in an aluminium structure on Signal Deck and Sports Deck (now \"Sun Deck\"), behind the ship's [[Bridge (ship)|bridge]], and in 1977 this structure was expanded to include more suites with balconies, making ''QE2'' one of the first ships to offer private terraces to passengers since ''Normandie'' in the 1930s.\n\n''QE2''{{'}}s balcony accommodation was expanded for the final time during ''QE2''{{'}}s 1986/87 refurbishment in [[Bremerhaven]]. During this refit the ship was given a new wider funnel built using panels from the original. It retained the traditional Cunard colours. \n\n''QE2''{{'}}s final structural changes included the reworking of the aft decks during the 1994 refit (following the removal of the magrodome), and the addition of an undercover area on Sun Deck during her 2005 refit, creating a space known as Funnel Bar.\n\n===Interiors===\n''Queen Elizabeth 2''{{'}}s interior configuration was laid out in a horizontal fashion, similar to ''France'', where the spaces dedicated to the two classes were spread horizontally on specific decks, in contrast to the vertical class divisions of older liners. Where ''QE2'' differed from ''France'' was that the first class deck (Quarter Deck) was below the deck dedicated to tourist class (Upper Deck). Originally there were to be main lounges serving three classes, layered one atop the other, but when Cunard decided to make the ship a two class vessel, only two main lounges were needed.\n\nInstead of completely reconfiguring the Boat Deck, the ship's architects simply opened a well in the deck between what were to have been the second and third class lounges, creating a double height space known as the Double Room (now the Grand Lounge). This too was unconventional in that it designated a grander two-storey space for tourist class passengers, while first class passengers gathered in the standard height Queen's Room. The configuration for segregated Atlantic crossings gave first class passengers the theatre balcony on Boat Deck, while tourist class used the orchestra level on Upper Deck.\n\nOver the span of her thirty-nine-year seagoing career, ''QE2'' received a number of interior refits and alterations.\n\nThe year she came into service, 1969, was also the year of the [[Apollo 11]] mission, when the [[Concorde]]'s prototype was unveiled, and the previous year [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s film ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' premiered. In keeping with those times, originally Cunard broke from the traditional interiors of their previous liners for ''QE2'', especially the [[Art Deco]] style of the previous ''Queens''. Instead modern materials like [[Laminate|plastic laminates]], aluminium and [[Perspex]] were used. The public rooms featured glass, stainless steel, dark carpeting and sea green leather.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The New Cunard Queens Queen Mary 2 Queen Victoria Queen Elizabeth 2 |last=Schwerdtner|first=Nils |publisher=Seaforth Publishing|year=2008|isbn=978-1-84832-010-9|location=47 Church Street|pages=27\u201328|via=}}</ref> Furniture was modular and [[abstract art]] was used throughout public rooms and cabins.\n\n[[Dennis Lennon]] was responsible for co-ordinating the interior design, and his team included [[Jon Bannenberg]] and [[Gaby Schreiber]], although Lennon's original designs only remained intact for three years.<ref name=\"scotsman.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/culture/art/sixties-splendour-revived-as-exhibition-celebrates-qe2-formica-fest-1-4687051|title=Sixties splendour revived as exhibition celebrates QE2 Formica fest|author=|date=|website=www.scotsman.com|accessdate=5 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nThe Midships Lobby on Two Deck, where first class passengers boarded for transatlantic journeys and all passengers boarded for cruises, was a circular room with a sunken seating area in the centre with green leather clad banquettes, and surrounded by a chrome railing. As a kingpin to this was a flared, white, trumpet shaped, up lit column.\n\nAnother room, designed by [[Michael Inchbald]], where ''QE2''{{'}}s advanced interior design was demonstrated was the first class lounge, the Queen's Room on Quarter Deck. This space, in colours of white and tan, featured a lowered ceiling with large indirectly lit slots, which, despite reducing the ceiling height, created an impression of airy openness above to deal with the otherwise oppressive dimensions of the single storey room (c. 30m x 30m x 2.4m). In addition the structural columns were flared at the top to blend into the ceiling and to lose the visual indication of low ceiling height that straight columns would have given. (The Midships Lobby copied these features but without achieving the airiness.) Inchbald repeated the flaring of the columns in the bases of his tables and leather shell chairs. The indirect lighting from above could be switched from a cool hue for summer to a warm hue for winter.<ref>Explained to the author by his father, Michael Inchbald</ref>\n\nThe Theatre Bar on Upper Deck featured red chairs, red drapes, a red egg crate fibreglass screen, and even a red baby [[grand piano]]. Some more traditional materials like wood veneer were used as highlights throughout the ship, especially in passenger corridors and staterooms. There was also an Observation Bar on Quarter Deck, a successor to its namesake, located in a similar location, on both previous ''Queens'', which offered views through large windows over the ship's bow. This room was lost in ''QE2''{{'}}s 1972 refit, becoming galley space with the forward-facing windows plated over.\n\nIn the 1994 refit, almost all of the remaining original decor was replaced, with Cunard opting to reverse the original design direction of ''QE2''{{'}}s designers and use the line's traditional ocean liners as inspiration. The green velvet and leather Midships Bar became the [[Art Deco]] inspired Chart Room, receiving an original, custom designed piano from ''Queen Mary''. The (by now) blue dominated Theatre Bar was transformed into the Golden Lion Pub, which mimics a traditional [[Edwardian period|Edwardian]] pub.\n\nSome original elements were retained including the flared columns in the Queens Room and Mid-Ships Lobby which were incorporated into the reworked designs. The Queen's Room's indirect lighting from above was replaced with uplighters which reversed the original light airy effect by illuminating the lowered ceiling and leaving shadows in the ceiling's slot. The furniture and carpet which replaced Michael Inchbald's designs were incongruous next to the flared columns and slotted ceiling.\n\nBy the time of her retirement, the Synagogue was the only room that had remained unaltered since 1969.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://members.tripod.com/~Tziper/today.htm | title=Queen Elizabeth 2: Today |publisher=Members.tripod.com |accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref> However it was reported that during ''QE2''{{'}}s 22 October five night voyage, the Synagogue was carefully dismantled before being removed from the ship prior to her final sailing to Dubai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.travelserver.net/travelpage/ubb-bin/ultimatebb.cgi?ubb=get_topic&f=3&t=004606 |title=Cruise Talk&nbsp;\u2013 Topic: QE2's Synagogue dismantled |publisher=Travelserver.net |accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Artwork and artefacts===\n[[File:QE2 bell.jpg|thumb|''QE2'' bell on display on the {{MS|Queen Elizabeth}}]]\nThe designers included numerous pieces of artwork within the public rooms of the ship, as well as maritime artefacts drawn from Cunard's long history of operating merchant vessels.\n\n[[Althea Wynne]]\u2019s sculpture of the ''White Horses'' of the Atlantic Ocean was installed in the Mauretania Restaurant.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/art-obituaries/9082747/Althea-Wynne.html Althea Wynne (obituary)] in [[The Daily Telegraph]] dated 14 February 2012, online at telegraph.co.uk.

Four life-size statues of human forms\u2014created by sculptor Janine Janet in marine materials like shell and coral, representing the four elements\u2014were installed in the Princess Grill. A frieze designed by Brody Nevenshwander, depicting the words of [[T. S. Eliot]], Sir [[Francis Drake]], and [[John Masefield]], was in the Chart Room. The Midships Lobby housed a solid silver model of ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' made by Asprey of Bond Street in 1975, which was lost until a photograph found in 1997 led to the discovery of the model itself. It was placed on ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' in 1999.\n\nThree custom-designed tapestries were commissioned from [[Helena Hernmarck]] for the ship\u2019s launch, depicting the Queen as well as the launch of the ship. These tapestries were originally hung in the Quarter Deck \"D\" Stairway, outside the Columbia Restaurant. They were originally made with golden threads, but much of this was lost when they were incorrectly cleaned during the 1987 refit. They were subsequently hung in the \"E\" stairway, and later damaged in 2005.\n\nThere are numerous photographs, oils, and pastels of members of the [[British Royal Family|Royal Family]] throughout the vessel.\n\nThe ship also housed items from previous Cunard ships, including both a brass relief plaque with a fish motif from the first {{RMS|Mauretania|1906}} and an Art-Deco bas-relief titled ''Winged Horse and Clouds'' by Norman Foster from [[RMS Queen Elizabeth]]. There were also a vast array of Cunard postcards, porcelain, flatware, boxes, linen, and [[Lines Bros]] Tri-ang Minic model ships. One of the key pieces was a replica of the [[figurehead]] from Cunard's first ship [[RMS Britannia]], carved from [[Quebec]] yellow pine by [[Cornwall|Cornish]] sculptor Charles Moore and presented to the ship by [[Lloyd's of London]].\n\nOn the Upper Deck sits the silver Boston Commemorative Cup, presented to ''Britannia'' by the City of Boston in 1840. This cup was lost for decades until it was found in a pawn shop in Halifax, Nova Scotia. On \"2\" Deck was a bronze entitled ''Spirit of the Atlantic'' that was designed by Barney Seale for the second {{RMS|Mauretania|1938}}. A large wooden plaque was presented to ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' by [[First Sea Lord]] Sir [[John Fieldhouse, Baron Fieldhouse|John Fieldhouse]] to commemorate the ship's service as a Hired Military Transport (HMT) in the [[Falklands War]].\n\nThere was also an extensive collection of large-scale models of Cunard ships located throughout ''Queen Elizabeth 2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magwa.co.uk/qe2/qe2prt01.htm |title=Interiors of QE2 following The Cunard Heritage Trail in part |publisher=Magwa.co.uk |accessdate=10 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nOver the years the ship's collection was added to. Among those items was a set of antique Japanese armour presented to ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' by the Governor of [[Kagoshima]], Japan, during her 1979 world cruise, as was a [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]] vase presented to the ship by Lord Wedgwood.\n\nThroughout the public areas were also silver plaques commemorating the visits of every member of the Royal Family, as well as other dignitaries such as South African president [[Nelson Mandela]].\n\nIstithmar bought most of these items from Cunard when it purchased ''QE2''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://qe2thelastcrossing.blogspot.com/2008/10/qe2-heritage-trail.html |title=QE2 Heritage Trail |accessdate=25 May 2010|date=2008-10-28 }}</ref>\n\n===Crew accommodation===\nThe majority of crew were accommodated in two- or four-berth cabins, with showers and toilets at the end of each alleyway.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} These were located forward and aft on decks three to six.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} At the time she entered service, the crew areas were a significant improvement over those aboard {{RMS|Queen Mary}} and {{RMS|Queen Elizabeth}}; however the ship's age and the lack of renovation of the crew area during her 40 years of service, in contrast to passenger areas, which were updated periodically, meant that this accommodation was considered basic by the end of her career.

A fourth bar, dedicated for the officers, is located at the forward end of Boat Deck.

The turbines were rated with a maximum power output figure of 110,000 shaft horsepower (normally operating at 94,000&nbsp;hp) and coupled via double-reduction gearing to two six-bladed fixed-pitch [[propeller]]s.\n\nThe steam turbines were plagued with problems{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} from the time the ship first entered service and, despite being technically advanced and fuel-efficient in 1968, her consumption of 600 tons of fuel oil every twenty four hours was more than expected for such a ship by the 1980s. After seventeen years of service the availability of spare parts was becoming difficult due to the outdated design of the boilers and turbines and the constant use of the machinery which was mainly due to the deletion of the originally planned 4th boiler as a cost saving measure whilst on the drawing board by Cunard.\n\nThe shipping company decided that the options were to either do nothing for the remainder of the ship's life, re-configure the existing engines, or completely re-engine the vessel with a modern, more efficient and more reliable diesel-electric powerplant. Ultimately it was decided to replace the engines, as it was calculated that the savings in fuel costs and maintenance would pay for themselves over four years whilst giving the vessel a minimum of another twenty years of service, whereas the other options would only provide short-term relief.<ref name=\"Rob Lightbody\">{{cite web| url=http://www.roblightbody.com/liners/qe-2/1987_Refit/ |publisher=Rob Lightbody |title=QE2's Major 1986\u20131987 re-engining refit |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref> Her steam turbines had taken her to a record breaking total of 2,622,858 miles in 18 years.<ref name=\"The Cunarders\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/QE2%20History.html |publisher=The Cunarders |title=The Cunarders QE2 History |accessdate=23 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101213081103/http://www.thecunarders.co.uk/QE2%20History.html |archive-date=13 December 2010 |url-status=dead|df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nDuring the ship's 1986 to 1987 refit, the steam turbines were removed and replaced with nine German [[MAN SE|MAN]] 9L58/64 nine-cylinder, medium-speed diesel engines, each weighing approximately 120 tons. Using a diesel-electric configuration, each engine drives a generator, each developing 10.5 MW of electrical power at 10,000 volts. This electrical plant, in addition to powering the ship's auxiliary and hotel services through transformers, drives the two main propulsion motors, one on each propeller shaft. These motors produce 44 MW each and are of synchronised salient-pole construction, nine metres in diameter and weighing more than 400 tons each.\n\nThe ship's service speed of {{convert|28.5|kn|km/h}} was now maintained using only seven of the diesel-electric sets. The maximum power output with the new engine configuration running increased to 130,000&nbsp;hp, which was greater than the previous system's 110,000&nbsp;hp. Using the same IBF-380 ([[Bunker C]]) fuel, the new configuration yielded a 35% fuel saving over the previous system. During the re-engining process, her funnel was replaced by a wider one to accommodate the exhaust pipes for the nine MAN diesel engines.\n\nDuring the refit, the original fixed-pitch propellers were replaced with [[controllable-pitch propeller|variable-pitch propellers]]. The old steam propulsion system required astern turbines to move the ship backwards or stop her moving forward. The pitch of the new variable pitch blades could simply be reversed, causing a reversal of propeller thrust while maintaining the same direction of propeller rotation, allowing the ship shorter stopping times and improved handling characteristics.\n\nThe new propellers were originally fitted with \"Grim Wheels\", named after their inventor, Dr. Ing Otto Grim.<ref name=\"Rob Lightbody\"/> These were free-spinning propeller blades fitted behind the main propellers, with long vanes protruding from the centre hub. The Grim Wheels were designed to recover lost propeller thrust and reduce fuel consumption by 2.5 to 3%. After the trial of these wheels, when the ship was drydocked, the majority of the vanes on each wheel were discovered to have broken off. The wheels were removed and the project abandoned.\n\nOther machinery includes nine heat recovery boilers, coupled with two oil-fired boilers to produce steam for heating fuel, domestic water, swimming pools, laundry equipment, and galleys. Four flash evaporators and a reverse-osmosis unit desalinate sea water to produce 1000 tons of fresh water daily. There is also a sanitation system and sewage disposal plant, air conditioning plant, and an electro-hydraulic steering system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qe2.org.uk/engine.html |title=The engine room |publisher=QE2 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Construction==\nOn 30 December 1964, Cunard placed an order for construction of the new ship with [[John Brown and Company]], who would build it at their shipyard in [[Clydebank]], Scotland. The agreed price was \u00a325,427,000 with provision for escalation of labour and materials increases, with an agreed delivery date of May 1968.<ref name=\"PayneP33\">Payne. Page 33.</ref> To assist with its construction the British government provided financial assistance to Cunard in the form of a \u00a317.6 million loan at 4.5% interest.<ref name=PayneP33/>\n\nThe keel was laid down on 5 July 1965, as hull number 736 on the same slipway where previous Cunard liners such as {{RMS|Lusitania|3=2}}, {{RMS|Aquitania|3=2}}, ''Queen Mary'', and ''Queen Elizabeth'' had been constructed.\n\nAs construction continued on the new ship, Cunard found itself in increasing financial difficulties as increased competition from airlines resulted in the company's passenger ships losing money. With profits from its cargo ships eventually unable to offset the losses, Cunard was forced to sell ''Mauretania'', ''Sylvania'', ''Carinthia'', ''Caronia'', ''Queen Mary'' and ''Queen Elizabeth'' between 1965 and 1968. Income also fell due to a seven-week-long seamans' strike in 1966.<ref name=PayneP33/> Then John Brown advised that the delivery would be delayed by six months, which meant the ship would miss the 1968 peak summer transatlantic season. Following market research Cunard decided to take advantage of the delay to change the original three-class configuration of the ship to a more flexible two-class arrangement of First and Tourist.<ref name=PayneP33/>\n\nOn 20 September 1967 with the launch date approaching, Cunard (having lost \u00a37.5 million the previous year) approached the government with a request for an additional \u00a33 million loan to complete the ship.<ref name=PayneP33/> Eventually the government agreed to increase the original \u00a317.6 million loan up to \u00a324 million.<ref>Glen.

No bomb was found, but the [[hoaxer]] was arrested by the [[FBI]].<ref name=\"chrisqe2hist\"/>\n\nThe following year ''QE2'' undertook two chartered cruises through the Mediterranean to [[Israel]] in commemoration of the 25th anniversary of the state's founding. The ship's Columbia Restaurant was koshered for Passover, and Jewish passengers were able to celebrate [[Passover]] on the ship. According to the book \"The Angel\" by [[Uri Bar-Joseph]], [[Muammar Gaddafi]] ordered a submarine to torpedo her during one of the chartered cruises in retaliation for Israel's downing of [[Libyan Arab Airlines Flight 114|Libyan Flight 114]], but [[Anwar Sadat]] intervened secretly to foil the attack.\n\nOn 23 July 1976 while ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was 80 miles off the Scilly Isles on a transatlantic voyage, a flexible coupling drive connecting the starboard main engine high pressure rotor and the reduction gear box ruptured. This allowed lubricating oil under pressure to enter into the main engine room where it ignited, creating a severe fire. It took 20 minutes to bring the fire under control. Reduced down to two boilers, the ship limped back to Southampton. Damage from the fire resulted in a replacement boiler having to be fitted by dry-docking the ship and cutting an access hole in her side.<ref name=PayneP36/>\n\nBy 1978 ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' was breaking even with an occupancy of 65%, generating revenues of greater than 30 million per year against which had to be deducted an annual fuel cost of \u00a35 million and a monthly crew cost of \u00a3225,000. With it costing \u00a380,000 a day for her to sit idle in port, her owners made every attempt to keep her at sea and full of passengers. As a result, as much maintenance as possible was undertaken while at sea. However, she needed all three of her boilers to be in service if she was to maintain her transatlantic schedule. With limited ability to maintain her boilers, reliability was becoming a serious issue.<ref>Payne.

Boiler problems caused Cunard to cancel a cruise, and, in October 1984, an electrical fire caused a complete loss of power. The ship was delayed for several days before power could be restored. Instead of replacing the QE2 with a newer vessel, Cunard decided that it was more prudent to simply make improvements to her. Therefore, from 27 October 1986 to 25 April 1987,<ref name=PayneP36/> ''QE2'' underwent one of her most significant refurbishments when she was converted by Lloyd Werft at their shipyard in Bremerhaven, Germany from steam power to diesel.<ref name=\"chrisqe2hist\" /><ref name=PayneP38/> Nine [[MAN B&W]] diesel electric engines, new propellers and a heat recovery system (to utilise heat expelled by the engines) were fitted, which halved the fuel consumption.

Her Majesty, Queen Elizabeth II moved to the front of the launching platform and was handed an envelope by John Rannie with the name of the ship inside.

Sir Basil {{sic|hide=y|Smallpeice}}<!-- DO NOT CHANGE SPELLING! SMALLPEICE IS CORRECT--> was overjoyed at the sovereign's alteration of the name. (paragraph reference his autobiography {{ISBN|0-906393-10-8}}) He could not have been more delighted with having the third of the great royal Cunarders named in this manner. The decision promptly was made to style the giant liner ''Queen Elizabeth 2'' using the numeral two to differentiate the ship from the sovereign.\n}}\n</ref> The name had been given to the Queen in a sealed envelope which she didn't open. The book, referencing his autobiography, states that the Cunard chairman Sir Basil {{sic|hide=y|Smallpeice}}<!-- DO NOT CHANGE SPELLING!
