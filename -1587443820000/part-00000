This sparks debate between Clancy and Glasses Man as to whether there is such a thing as a 'good drug' or a 'bad drug'.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatronic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]].com|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust.

The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nFor Ward, the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel.

Some time later Trussell and Ward became friends and Ward suggested to Trussell to turn his podcast into an animated series. According to Ward, Trussell had the ability to make 2 hours of a meditation conversation funny. Trussell says: \"He reached out to me and said he had an idea for how to animate my podcast, which was another big thrill for me.\"<ref name=\"Inverse\">{{cite web |last1=Kleinman |first1=Jake |title='Midnight Gospel' Was Seven Years In The Making.

In 2018, Ward approached to him again to show a rough concept taking a podcast conversation about drug addiction and playing it over an animatronic of Trussell and his guest fighting off a zombie invasion.<ref name=\"Inverse\"/>\n\nLater, the rough of concept ended up being incorporated into the pilot of the series. The two took the concept of the series in pitching form to Mike Moon, head of adult animations at Netflix. In 2019, Netflix has ordered eight episodes, which is slated to premiere in sometime in 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/12/netflix-order-adult-animated-series-the-midnight-gospel-from-pendleton-ward-duncan-trussell-1202814276/|title=Netflix Orders Adult Animated Series \u2018The Midnight Gospel\u2019 From Pendleton Ward & Duncan Trussell|publisher=[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]].com|first1=Denise|last1=Petski|accessdate=April 20, 2020|date=December 19, 2019}}</ref> After gaining the green light, the two gathered a team of comedians like [[Johnny Pemberton]], Brendon Walsh, [[\"Weird Al\" Yankovic]] and [[Emo Philips]] were joined by occult scholar Jason Louv and white witch Maja D\u2019Aoust.

The team behind the show are composed by Jesse Moynihan (art director), Antonio Canobbio (Chief Creative Officer for Titmouse), Mike Roush (animation director) and Joey Adams (storyboard supervisor). Mayfield said that the time needed to \"try something nine different ways before one little change would make it go from clunky to incredible.\"<ref name=\"AnMag\"/>\n\nFor Ward, the new series was a chance to explore the brave, new world of making animation for grown-ups. Until then he had made animations for children only and the new show would be a chance to change his way of making animations using the ultra-violence of cartoons with conversations on compassion. Ward also allowed Trussell to include his own original music in several episodes. The show's title came from the good news sense of the word gospel.

Its earliest use is not known. [[Pamheiba]], the ruler of the [[Manipur Kingdom]] who introduced [[Hinduism]], banned the use of the Meitei script and adopted the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. Now in schools and colleges, the Bengali script is gradually being replaced by the Meitei script. The local organisations have played a major role in spreading awareness about their own script.\n\nMany Meitei documents were destroyed at the beginning of the 18th century during the reign of Hindu converted King Pamheiba, under the instigation of the Bengali Hindu missionary, [[Shantidas Gosai]].\n\nBetween 1709 and the middle of the 20th century, the Meitei language was written using the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] script. During the 1940s and 1950s, Meitei scholars began campaigning to bring back the Old Meitei (Old Manipuri) alphabet. In 1976 at a writers conference, all the scholars finally agreed on a new version of the alphabet containing a number of additional letters to represent sounds not present in Meitei when the script was first developed. The current Meitei alphabet is a reconstruction of the ancient Meitei script.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the Meitei alphabet has been taught in schools in [[Manipur]].\n\nIt is a syllabic alphabet in which consonants all have an inherent vowel /a/. Other vowels are written as independent letters or by using diacritical marks that are written above, below, before or after the consonant they belong to. Each letter is named after a part of the human body.\n\nThere are some texts from the [[Maring Naga|Maring]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] tribes of Manipur, which were written in the Meitei script.\n\n===Latin script===\nThere exists an informal, but fairly consistent practical spelling of Meitei in Latin script. This spelling is used in the transcription of personal names and place names, and it is extensively used on the internet (Facebook, blogspots, etc.). It is also found in academic publications, for the spelling of Meitei book titles and the like (examples can be seen in the References, below). This spelling, on the whole, offers a transparent, unambiguous representation of the Meitei sound system, although the tones are usually not marked. It is \"practical\" in the sense that it does not use extra-alphabetical symbols, and can, therefore, be produced easily on any standard keyboard. The only point of ambiguity is found in the spelling of the vowels /\u0250/ and /a/, which are usually both written \"a\", except when they occur before an [[approximant]] (see table below). The vowel /a/ is sometimes written as \"aa\" to distinguish it from /\u0250/.\n\n{|| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! IPA !!

Verbs associated with the pluralised nouns are unaffected. Examples are demonstrated below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\">{{cite journal |last=Singh |first=S. Indrakumar |date=November 2013 |title=Agreements in Manipuri |url=http://www.languageinindia.com/nov2013/indrakumaragreementsmanipurifinal.pdf |journal=Language in India |volume=13 |issue=11 |pages=216\u2013231}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Example (English)\n|-\n| angaang || baby || angaang kappi|| Baby cries.\n|-\n| angaangsing || babies || angaangsing kappi || Babies cry.\n|}\n\nWhen adjectives are used to be more clear, Meitei utilises separate words and does not add a suffix to the noun. Examples are show in the chart below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Adjective (Meitei) !! Adjective (English) !! Example (Meitei) !!

While the variety of suffixes is high, all compound verbs utilise one of two:<ref name=\"Devi 2014\">{{cite journal |last1=Devi |first1=M.

Suffix !! English translation\n|-\n| -thok|| out/ come out\n|-\n| -ning|| To wish/ want/ desire\n|}\n\nAspect markers appear as suffixes that clarify verb tense and appear at the end of the compound verb. Overall, the formula to construct a compound verb becomes [root verb] + [suffix] + [aspect marker]:<ref name=\"Devi 2014\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Language !! Root verb !! Suffix !!

Young children who do not know about the tales that have been passed on from generation to generation are very rare.

Its earliest use is not known. [[Pamheiba]], the ruler of the [[Manipur Kingdom]] who introduced [[Hinduism]], banned the use of the Meitei script and adopted the [[Bengali alphabet|Bengali script]]. Now in schools and colleges, the Bengali script is gradually being replaced by the Meitei script. The local organisations have played a major role in spreading awareness about their own script.\n\nMany Meitei documents were destroyed at the beginning of the 18th century during the reign of Hindu converted King Pamheiba, under the instigation of the Bengali Hindu missionary, [[Shantidas Gosai]].\n\nBetween 1709 and the middle of the 20th century, the Meitei language was written using the [[Bengali language|Bengali]] script. During the 1940s and 1950s, Meitei scholars began campaigning to bring back the Old Meitei (Old Manipuri) alphabet. In 1976 at a writers conference, all the scholars finally agreed on a new version of the alphabet containing a number of additional letters to represent sounds not present in Meitei when the script was first developed. The current Meitei alphabet is a reconstruction of the ancient Meitei script.\n\nSince the early 1980s, the Meitei alphabet has been taught in schools in [[Manipur]].\n\nIt is a syllabic alphabet in which consonants all have an inherent vowel /a/. Other vowels are written as independent letters or by using diacritical marks that are written above, below, before or after the consonant they belong to. Each letter is named after a part of the human body.\n\nThere are some texts from the [[Maring Naga|Maring]] and [[Limbu people|Limbu]] tribes of Manipur, which were written in the Meitei script.\n\n===Latin script===\nThere exists an informal, but fairly consistent practical spelling of Meitei in Latin script. This spelling is used in the transcription of personal names and place names, and it is extensively used on the internet (Facebook, blogspots, etc.). It is also found in academic publications, for the spelling of Meitei book titles and the like (examples can be seen in the References, below). This spelling, on the whole, offers a transparent, unambiguous representation of the Meitei sound system, although the tones are usually not marked. It is \"practical\" in the sense that it does not use extra-alphabetical symbols, and can, therefore, be produced easily on any standard keyboard. The only point of ambiguity is found in the spelling of the vowels /\u0250/ and /a/, which are usually both written \"a\", except when they occur before an [[approximant]] (see table below). The vowel /a/ is sometimes written as \"aa\" to distinguish it from /\u0250/.\n\n{|| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! IPA !!

Verbs associated with the pluralised nouns are unaffected. Examples are demonstrated below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\">{{cite journal |last=Singh |first=S.

Example (English)\n|-\n| angaang || baby || angaang kappi|| Baby cries.\n|-\n| angaangsing || babies || angaangsing kappi || Babies cry.\n|}\n\nWhen adjectives are used to be more clear, Meitei utilises separate words and does not add a suffix to the noun. Examples are show in the chart below:<ref name=\"Singh 2013\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Adjective (Meitei) !! Adjective (English) !! Example (Meitei) !!

Suffix !! English translation\n|-\n| -thok|| out/ come out\n|-\n| -ning|| To wish/ want/ desire\n|}\n\nAspect markers appear as suffixes that clarify verb tense and appear at the end of the compound verb. Overall, the formula to construct a compound verb becomes [root verb] + [suffix] + [aspect marker]:<ref name=\"Devi 2014\" />\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Language !! Root verb !! Suffix !!
