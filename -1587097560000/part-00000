He is the son of Reine Gagn\u00e9 and [[Daniel Johnson Sr.]], who had been the Premier of Quebec from 1966 to his death in 1968, as the leader of the ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'', a [[Conservatism|conservative]] political party. His brother is [[Pierre-Marc Johnson]], [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] leader from 1985-1987 and Premier of Quebec from October 3 to December 12, 1985.\n\nJohnson received his [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] in 1966.  He also received LL.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the [[University College London]] in 1968 and 1971 respectively, as well as a [[Master of Business Administration]] from the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1973. Johnson immediately began his career in the business world and worked for [[Power Corporation of Canada]] from 1973 to 1981.  He served as the Vice-President of Power Corp. from 1978 to 1981.  During that period, Daniel Johnson was active in the Montreal community, acting as Vice-president of the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, and sat on other non-profit boards, such as the Montreal Heart Institute and the Grands Ballets Canadiens.\n\n==Political career==\nJohnson was first elected to the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] in the riding of [[Vaudreuil-Soulanges (provincial electoral district)|Vaudreuil-Soulanges]] in the [[1981 Quebec general election]].  He ran for the [[Quebec Liberal Party leadership elections#1983 leadership convention|1983 Quebec Liberal Party leadership convention]] but finished third behind [[Pierre Paradis]] and winner [[Robert Bourassa]]. He was re-elected in the [[1985 Quebec general election|1985 election]], which brought the Liberals to power. He became Minister of industry and Commerce in the Quebec government, and was Chairman of the Treasury Board from June 1988 until January 1994.\n\nIn January 1994, he became leader of the Quebec Liberal Party and Premier of Quebec following the resignation of Liberal leader [[Robert Bourassa]]. He then lost the [[1994 Quebec general election|1994 provincial election]] to [[Jacques Parizeau]] of the ''[[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]]''.\n\nDuring the [[1995 Quebec referendum]], he headed the \"No\" federalist campaign, in opposition to the PQ's proposals for Quebec sovereignty.

He is the son of Reine Gagn\u00e9 and [[Daniel Johnson Sr.]], who had been the Premier of Quebec from 1966 to his death in 1968, as the leader of the ''[[Union Nationale (Quebec)|Union Nationale]]'', a [[Conservatism|conservative]] political party. His brother is [[Pierre-Marc Johnson]], [[Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] leader from 1985-1987 and Premier of Quebec from October 3 to December 12, 1985.\n\nJohnson received his [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree from the [[Universit\u00e9 de Montr\u00e9al]] in 1966.  He also received LL.M. and Ph.D. degrees from the [[University College London]] in 1968 and 1971 respectively, as well as a [[Masters of Business Administration]] from the [[Harvard Business School]] in 1973.

During that period, Daniel Johnson was active in the Montreal community, acting as Vice-president of the Montreal Chamber of Commerce, and sat on other non-profit boards, such as the Montreal Heart Institute and the Grands Ballets Canadiens.\n\n==Political career==\nJohnson was first elected to the [[National Assembly of Quebec]] in the riding of [[Vaudreuil-Soulanges (provincial electoral district)|Vaudreuil-Soulanges]] in the [[1981 Quebec general election]].

With the sovereignty campaign leading in polls, Prime Minister [[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]] and federal [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada|Progressive Conservative]] leader (and former Deputy Prime Minister) [[Jean Charest]] went to the province to help the \"No\" side campaign.

Despite feeling ill he visited with his family and they traveled around Hong Kong. By the morning of 22 February, he knew he was very sick and walked to nearby [[Kwong Wah Hospital]] to seek treatment. He warned staff that he was very sick and to put him in isolation. He never recovered and died in the Intensive Care Unit on 4 March.\n\nLiu is believed to have been a SARS super-spreader: 23 other Metropole guests developed SARS, including seven from the ninth floor. Liu's brother-in-law, who sought treatment in late February, was hospitalized in Kwong Wah Hospital on 1 March and died on 19 March. It is estimated that around 80% of the Hong Kong cases were due to Liu.<ref name=Khan2016>Khan, Ali S. & Patrick, William.

He fell ill during the flight and told a friend waiting at Bangkok not to touch him, to call an ambulance and take him to a hospital. He was isolated in an Intensive Care Unit. A similar outbreak of a mysterious respiratory infection was reported among Hong Kong healthcare workers.\n\nOn 12 March, WHO issued a global alert about a new infectious disease of unknown origin in both Vietnam and Hong Kong. On 15 March, WHO issued a heightened global health alert about a mysterious pneumonia with a case definition of SARS after cases in Singapore and Canada were also identified. The alert included a rare emergency travel advisory to international travelers, healthcare professionals, and health authorities. The [[Center for Disease Control]] (CDC) issued a travel advisory stating that persons considering travel to the affected areas in Asia (Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, and China) should not go.\n\nOn 17 March, an international network of 11 laboratories was established to determine the cause of SARS and develop potential treatments. The CDC held its first briefing on SARS and said that 14 suspected SARS cases were being investigated in the US. On 20 March, WHO reported that several hospitals in Vietnam and Hong Kong were operating with half the usual staff because many workers stayed home out of fear of getting infected. WHO raised the concern that substandard care of the infected patients might contribute to the spread of the disease.\n\nOn 25 March, Hong Kong authorities stated that nine tourists had contracted the disease from a mainland Chinese man who had boarded the same plane on 15 March, [[Air China Flight 112]] to Beijing.<ref name=Koh2003>{{Cite journal|last=Koh|first=D.|last2=Lim|first2=M.

The balcony was completely closed and guarded by the police. The residents of the building were later transferred to the quarantined [[Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp]] and Lady MacLehose Holiday Village on 1 April because the building was deemed a health hazard.\n\nMost of the cases were linked to apartments with a north-western orientation which shared the same sewage pipe. According to government officials, the virus was brought into the estate by an infected [[kidney]] patient (the type of kidney illness was not specified) after discharge from [[Prince of Wales Hospital]], who visited his elder brother living on the seventh floor. Through excretion, the virus spread through drainage. One theory speculated that the virus was spread by [[airborne transmission]], through dried up U-shaped P-traps in the drainage system which a maritime breeze blew into the estate's balconies and stairwell ventilation. It was confirmed that the virus spread via droplets, but this later outbreak made officials question the possibility that the virus could be spread through the air.\n\n=== April 2003 ===\nOn 1 April, the U.S. government called back non-essential personnel in their consulate office in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. The US government also advised US citizens not to travel to the region.\n\nOn 2 April, Chinese medical officials began reporting the status of the SARS outbreak. China's southern Guangdong province reported 361 new infections and 9 new deaths, increasing the total [[Mainland China]] figures previously reported at end-February. The virus was also detected in Beijing and Shanghai. The WHO also advised travellers to avoid Hong Kong and Guangdong during a press briefing.<ref>[http://www.who.int/csr/sars/press2003_04_01/en/ Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome \u2013 Press briefing] 1 April 2003 ''www.who.int''.

Fifteen of the quarantined [[Amoy Gardens]] residents at [[Lei Yue Mun Holiday Camp]] were relocated to the [[Sai Kung Outdoor Recreation Centre]] after an overnight protest on washroom sharing. The first medical worker infected with SARS died in Hong Kong. The doctor's daughter and infected wife survived his illness, even though the wife was also among the quarantined medical workers under intensive care. Hong Kong school closures were extended by two weeks to 21 April.\n\nOn 4 April, the WHO team inspected the first infection case in Foshan County. The male infected four people. But, he did not infect his family. A 40-year-old woman became the first local case in Shanghai. A Chinese health specialist admitted at a press conference of not informing the public early enough about the outbreak. The PRC Health Minister also claimed that the disease has been under control in most parts of mainland China. He also released the names of seven drugs which he claimed to be effective in curing SARS. WHO officials said that the information provided by the PRC about the disease has been \"very detailed\".{{cn|date=January 2020}} US government enforced compulsory quarantine of an infected person.\n\nOn 5 April, the Singapore government announced that school closures would be extended.

Through excretion, the virus spread through drainage. One theory speculated that the virus was spread by [[airborne transmission]], through dried up U-shaped P-traps in the drainage system which a maritime breeze blew into the estate's balconies and stairwell ventilation. It was confirmed that the virus spread via droplets, but this later outbreak made officials question the possibility that the virus could be spread through the air.\n\n=== April 2003 ===\nOn 1 April, the U.S. government called back non-essential personnel in their consulate office in Hong Kong and Guangzhou.
