The Electoral College consists of 538 electors, and an [[absolute majority]] of at least 270 electoral votes is required to win the election. According to [[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution, each [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]] determines the manner by which its [[U.S. state|state's]] electors are chosen.

Committee member [[Gouverneur Morris]] explained the reasons for the change; among others, there were fears of \"intrigue\" if the president were chosen by a small group of men who met together regularly, as well as concerns for the independence of the president if he were elected by the Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/debates_904.asp|title=Debates in the Federal Convention of 1787: September 4|publisher=Avalon Project|accessdate=April 13, 2011}}</ref>\n\nHowever, once the Electoral College had been decided on, several delegates (Mason, Butler, Morris, Wilson, and Madison) openly recognized its ability to protect the election process from cabal, corruption, intrigue, and faction.

In [[Federalist No. 39]], Madison argued the Constitution was designed to be a mixture of [[Federalism in the United States|state-based]] and [[Proportional representation|population-based]] government. [[United States Congress|Congress]] would have two houses: the state-based [[United States Senate|Senate]] and the population-based [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]].

The electors come directly from the people and them alone for that purpose only, and for that time only. This avoided a party-run legislature, or a permanent body that could be influenced by foreign interests before each election.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\">Hamilton. [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp The Federalist Papers: No. 68] The Avalon Project, Yale Law School. viewed November 10, 2016.</ref> Hamilton explained the election was to take place among all the states, so no corruption in any state could taint \"the great body of the people\" in their selection. The choice was to be made by a majority of the Electoral College, as majority rule is critical to the principles of republican government. Hamilton argued that electors meeting in the state capitals were able to have information unavailable to the general public. Hamilton also argued that since no federal officeholder could be an elector, none of the electors would be beholden to any presidential candidate.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAnother consideration was the decision would be made without \"tumult and disorder\" as it would be a broad-based one made simultaneously in various locales where the decision-makers could deliberate reasonably, not in one place where decision-makers could be threatened or intimidated. If the Electoral College did not achieve a decisive majority, then the House of Representatives was to choose the president from among the top five candidates,<ref>The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] changed this to the top three candidates</ref> ensuring selection of a presiding officer administering the laws would have both ability and good character. Hamilton was also concerned about somebody unqualified, but with a talent for \"low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity\" attaining high office.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Federalist No. 10]], James Madison argued against \"an interested and overbearing majority\" and the \"mischiefs of faction\" in an electoral system. He defined a faction as \"a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\" What was then called republican government (i.e., [[representative democracy]], as opposed to [[direct democracy]]) combined with the principles of [[federalism]] (with distribution of voter rights and separation of government powers) would countervail against factions. Madison further postulated in the Federalist No.{{nbsp}}10 that the greater the population and expanse of the Republic, the more difficulty factions would face in organizing due to such issues as [[sectionalism]].<ref>''The Federalist Papers: Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay'' The New American Library, 1961</ref>\n\nAlthough the United States Constitution refers to \"Electors\" and \"electors\", neither the phrase \"Electoral College\" nor any other name is used to describe the electors collectively. It was not until the early 19th century the name \"Electoral College\" came into general usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast votes for president and vice president. The phrase was first written into federal law in 1845 and today the term appears in {{USC|3|4}}, in the section heading and in the text as \"college of electors\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html|title=U. S. Electoral College: Frequently Asked Questions|website=archives.gov}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\nInitially, state legislatures chose the electors in many of the states. That practice changed during the early 19th century, as states extended the right to vote to wider segments of the population. By [[1832 United States presidential election|1832]], only [[South Carolina]] had not transitioned to popular election. Since [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]], the electors in every state have been chosen based on a popular election held on [[Election Day (United States)|Election Day]].<ref name=CRS2017THN/> The popular election for electors means the president and vice president are in effect chosen through [[indirect election]] by the citizens.<ref>{{cite web|title=Electoral College|website=history.com|url=https://www.history.com/topics/electoral-college|publisher=A+E Networks|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> {{anchor|EvsP}}Since the mid-19th century when all electors have been popularly chosen, the Electoral College has elected the candidate who received the most popular votes nationwide, except in four elections: [[1876 United States presidential election|1876]], [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]], [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]], and [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]]. In [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]], there were six states in which electors were legislatively appointed, rather than popularly elected, so the true national popular vote is uncertain; the electors failed to select a winning candidate, so the matter was decided by the House of Representatives.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2008/03/presidents-winning-without-popular-vote/|title=Presidents Winning Without Popular Vote|first=D'Angelo|last=Gore|date=December 23, 2016|publisher=[[FactCheck.org]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Original plan ===\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 3: Electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 3]] of the Constitution provided the original plan by which the electors voted for president. Under the original plan, each elector cast two votes for president; electors did not vote for vice president. Whoever received a majority of votes from the electors would become president, with the person receiving the second most votes becoming vice president.\n\nThe original plan of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Stanley|title=Updating the Electoral College: The National Popular Vote Legislation|journal=Harvard Journal on Legislation|volume=44|issue=205, at 208|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|location=Cambridge, MA|year=2007}}</ref>\n# Choice of the president should reflect the \"sense of the people\" at a particular time, not the dictates of a faction in a \"pre-established body\" such as Congress or the State legislatures, and independent of the influence of \"foreign powers\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Hamilton, Alexander.

Hamilton so strongly believed this was to be done district by district, and when states began doing otherwise, he proposed a constitutional amendment to mandate the district system (Hamilton, [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289 Draft of a Constitutional Amendment]). Madison concurred, \"The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted.\" ([https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023 Madison to Hay, 1823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|date=May 25, 2017}})</ref>\n# Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting, deliberating with the most complete information available in a system that over time, tended to bring about a good administration of the laws passed by Congress.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n# Candidates would not pair together on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president.\n# The system as designed would rarely produce a winner, thus sending the presidential election to the House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to the text of Article II, however, each state government was free to have its own plan for selecting its electors, and the Constitution does not explicitly require states to popularly elect their electors. Several methods for selecting electors are described [[United States Electoral College#Alternative methods of choosing electors|below]].\n\n==== Breakdown and revision ====\nThe emergence of [[Political party|political parties]] and nationally coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]] and [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]. In 1796, [[Federalist Party]] candidate [[John Adams]] won the presidential election. Finishing in second place was [[Democratic-Republican Party]] candidate [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Federalists' opponent, who became the vice president. This resulted in the president and vice president being of different political parties.\n\nIn 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for president and also nominated [[Aaron Burr]] for vice president. After the electors voted, Jefferson and Burr tied one another with 73 electoral votes each. Since ballots did not distinguish between votes for president and votes for vice president, every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to become president, despite Jefferson clearly being his party's first choice. Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the election had to be decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] pursuant to the Constitution's contingency election provision.\n\nHaving already lost the presidential contest, Federalist Party representatives in the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] House session seized upon the opportunity to embarrass their opposition by attempting to elect Burr over Jefferson. The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations in the House (the votes of nine states were needed for a conclusive election). Jefferson achieved electoral victory on the 36th ballot, but only after Federalist Party leader [[Alexander Hamilton]]\u2014who disfavored Burr's personal character more than Jefferson's policies\u2014had made known his preference for Jefferson.\n\nResponding to the problems from those elections, the Congress proposed on December 9, 1803, and three-fourths of the states ratified by June 15, 1804, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. Starting with the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 election]], the amendment requires electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president, replacing the system outlined in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3.\n\n=== Evolution to the general ticket ===\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution states:\n{{quote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.}}\n\nAlexander Hamilton described the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers']] view of how electors would be chosen: {{quote|A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated [tasks].<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\">{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp|title=Federalist No 68|publisher=The Avalon Project}}</ref>}} They assumed this would take place district by district. That plan was carried out by many states until the 1880s. For example, in [[Massachusetts]] in 1820, the rule stated \"the people shall vote by ballot, on which shall be designated who is voted for as an Elector for the district.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0ouAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245|title=Resolves of the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Passed at Their Session, which Commenced on Wednesday, the Thirty First of May, and Ended on the Seventeenth of June, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty.

Russell, 1820; [repr|date=January 1, 1820|publisher=Boston Book Company|via=Google Books}}</ref> In other words, the people did not place the name of a candidate for a president on the ballot, instead they voted for their local elector, whom they trusted later to cast a responsible vote for president.\n\nSome states reasoned that the favorite presidential candidate among the people in their state would have a much better chance if all of the electors selected by their state were sure to vote the same way\u2014a \"general ticket\" of electors pledged to a party candidate.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\">Devin McCarthy (Ph.D. Polysci, Duke), [http://www.fairvote.org/how-the-electoral-college-became-winner-take-all \"How the Electoral College Became Winner-Take-All\"]</ref> So the slate of electors chosen by the state were no longer free agents, independent thinkers, or deliberative representatives. They became \"voluntary party lackeys and intellectual non-entities.\"<ref>Chief Justice Robert Jackson, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/214 Ray v. Blair, dissent, 1952]</ref> Once one state took that strategy, the others felt compelled to follow suit in order to compete for the strongest influence on the election.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\"/>\n\nWhen [[James Madison]] and Hamilton, two of the most important architects of the Electoral College, saw this strategy being taken by some states, they protested strongly. Madison and Hamilton both made it clear this approach violated the spirit of the Constitution. According to Hamilton, the selection of the president should be \"made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president].\"<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\"/> According to Hamilton, the electors were to analyze the list of potential presidents and select the best one. He also used the term \"deliberate\". Hamilton considered a pre-pledged elector to violate the spirit of Article II of the Constitution insofar as such electors could make no \"analysis\" or \"deliberate\" concerning the candidates. Madison agreed entirely, saying that when the Constitution was written, all of its authors assumed individual electors would be elected in their districts and it was inconceivable a \"general ticket\" of electors dictated by a state would supplant the concept. Madison wrote to George Hay: {{quote|The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted; & was exchanged for the general ticket [many years later].<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\">{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|title=Founders Online: James Madison to George Hay, 23 August 1823|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Founding Fathers assumed that each elector would be elected by the citizens of a district and that elector was to be free to analyze and deliberate regarding who is best suited to be president.\n\nMadison and Hamilton were so upset by what they saw as a distortion of the original intent that they advocated a constitutional amendment to prevent anything other than the district plan: \"the election of Presidential Electors by districts, is an amendment very proper to be brought forward,\" Madison told George Hay in 1823.<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\"/> Hamilton went further.

Then Andrew Jackson won in 1828, but that second campaign would also have been lost if the count in the Electoral College were by citizen-only apportionment alone. Scholars conclude that in the 1828 race, Jackson benefited materially from the Three-fifths clause by providing his margin of victory. The impact of the Three-fifths clause in both Jefferson's first and Jackson's first presidential elections was significant because each of them launched sustained Congressional party majorities over several Congresses, as well as presidential party eras.<ref>Brian D.

Electors meet in their respective [[List of capitals in the United States#State capitals|state capitals]] (electors for the District of Columbia meet within the District) on the Monday after the second Wednesday in December, at which time they cast their electoral votes on separate ballots for president and vice president.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment12/|title=Twelfth Amendment|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data/constitution/amendment23/|title=Twenty-third Amendment|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/uscode/3/1/7|title=U.S.C. \u00a7&nbsp;7 : US Code \u2013 Section 7: Meeting and vote of electors|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAlthough procedures in each state vary slightly, the electors generally follow a similar series of steps, and the Congress has constitutional authority to regulate the procedures the states follow. The meeting is opened by the election certification official \u2013 often that state's [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]] or equivalent \u2014 who reads the Certificate of Ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is the selection of a president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states, political officials give short speeches at this point in the proceedings.\n\nWhen the time for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or two people to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. Ballot formats vary between the states: in [[New Jersey]] for example, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in [[North Carolina]], the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.\n\nEach state's electors must complete six Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must be signed by all of the electors and a Certificate of Ascertainment must be attached to each of the Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must include the names of those who received an electoral vote for either the office of president or of vice president. The electors certify the Certificates of Vote and copies of the Certificates are then sent in the following fashion:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|title=U.S. Electoral College \u2013 For State Officials|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=November 7, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053914/http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* One is sent by [[registered mail]] to the [[President of the Senate]] (who usually is the incumbent [[vice president of the United States]]);\n* Two are sent by registered mail to the [[Archivist of the United States]];\n* Two are sent to the state's Secretary of State; and\n* One is sent to the chief judge of the [[United States district court]] where those electors met.\n\nA staff member of the President of the Senate collects the Certificates of Vote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the Congress.

Of that group, 71 did so because the nominee had died{{snd}}63 Democratic Party electors in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], when presidential nominee [[Horace Greeley]] died; and eight Republican Party electors in [[1912 United States presidential election|1912]], when vice presidential nominee [[James S.

As stated in the ruling, electors are acting as a functionary of the state, not the federal government. Therefore, states have the right to govern the process of choosing electors. The constitutionality of state laws punishing electors for actually casting a faithless vote, rather than refusing to pledge, has never been decided by the Supreme Court. However, in his dissent in ''Ray v. Blair'', Justice [[Robert H. Jackson|Robert Jackson]] wrote: \"no one faithful to our history can deny that the plan originally contemplated what is implicit in its text \u2014 that electors would be free agents, to exercise an independent and nonpartisan judgment as to the men best qualified for the Nation's highest offices.\"\n\n=== Joint session of Congress ===\n{{external media\n| float  = right\n| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9uiAex46pVw A joint session of Congress confirms the 2016 electoral college results], YouTube video.

The vice president and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] sit at the podium, with the vice president in the seat of the Speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the certificate of vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.\n\nMembers of Congress can object to any state's vote count, provided objection is presented in writing and is signed by at least one member of each house of Congress. An objection supported by at least one senator and one representative will be followed by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each House of Congress; after both Houses deliberate on the objection, the joint session is resumed. \n\nA state's certificate of vote can be rejected only if both Houses of Congress vote to accept the objection, meaning the votes from the State in question are not counted. Individual votes can also be rejected, and are also not counted. \n\nIn [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]], all of the votes from Louisiana and Tennessee were rejected, and in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], all of the votes from Arkansas and Louisiana plus three of the eleven electoral votes  from Georgia were rejected. <ref>{{cite book|author=David A.

Bush of Texas and the vice president of the United States, Al Gore. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of which were raised by only several representatives and would have favored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object. Objections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections, and on that occasion the document was presented by one representative and one senator. Although the joint session was suspended, the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress. \n\nIf there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply includes a state's votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the official tally.\n\nAfter the certificates from all states are read and the respective votes are counted, the presiding officer simply announces the final result of the vote and, provided the required absolute majority of votes was achieved, declares the names of the persons elected president and vice president. This announcement concludes the joint session and formalizes the recognition of the president-elect and of the vice president-elect. The senators then depart from the House Chamber. The final tally is printed in the Senate and House journals.\n\n=== Contingencies ===\n{{further|Contingent election}}\n\n==== Contingent presidential election by House ====\nThe [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] requires the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to go into session immediately to vote for a president if no candidate for president receives a majority of the electoral votes (since 1964, 270 of the 538 electoral votes).\n\nIn this event, the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes for president. Each state delegation votes ''en bloc'' \u2014 each delegation having a single vote; the District of Columbia does not get to vote. A candidate must receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes (i.e., at present, a minimum of 26 votes) in order for that candidate to become the ''president-elect''. Additionally, delegations from at least two thirds of all the states must be present for voting to take place. The House continues balloting until it elects a president.\n\nThe House of Representatives has chosen the president only twice: in [[1800 United States presidential election|1801]] under Article II, Section 1, Clause 3; and in [[1824 United States presidential election|1825]] under the Twelfth Amendment.\n\n==== Contingent vice presidential election by Senate ====\nIf no candidate for vice president receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, then the [[United States Senate|Senate]] must go into session to elect a vice president. The Senate is limited to choosing from the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. Normally this would mean two candidates, one less than the number of candidates available in the House vote. However, the text is written in such a way that ''all'' candidates with the most and second most electoral votes are eligible for the Senate election \u2013 this number could theoretically be larger than two. The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case (i.e., ballots are individually cast by each senator, not by state delegations). However, two-thirds of the senators must be present for voting to take place.\n\nAdditionally, the Twelfth Amendment states a \"majority of the whole number\" of senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm#_1_8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231654/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm|archivedate=June 28, 2011|title=RL30804: The Electoral College: An Overview and Analysis of Reform Proposals, L.

Section{{nbsp}}3 also specifies Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect in time for the inauguration. Under the [[Presidential Succession Act#Presidential Succession Act of 1947|Presidential Succession Act of 1947]], the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president.

The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by [[North Carolina]] and [[Ohio]] in 1932. [[Alabama]] was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the short ballot.\n\nThe question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain the legislature's choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in two U.S. Supreme Court cases. In ''[[McPherson v. Blacker]]'', {{ussc|146|1|1892}}, the Court cited Article II, Section 1, Clause{{nbsp}}2 which states that a state's electors are selected \"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct\" and wrote these words \"operat[e] as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power\". In ''Bush v. Palm Beach County Canvassing Board'', {{ussc|531|70|2000}}, a Florida Supreme Court decision was vacated (not reversed) based on ''McPherson''. On the other hand, three dissenting justices in ''[[Bush v. Gore]]'', {{ussc|531|98|2000}}, wrote: \"[N]othing in Article II of the Federal Constitution frees the state legislature from the constraints in the State Constitution that created it.\"<ref>[https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZD.html ''Bush v. Gore'', (Justice Stevens dissenting)] (quote in second paragraph)</ref>\n\n=== Appointment by state legislature ===\nIn the earliest presidential elections, state legislative choice was the most common method of choosing electors. A majority of the state legislatures selected presidential electors in both 1792 (9 of 15) and 1800 (10 of 16), and half of them did so in 1812.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=John L.|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|edition=2nd|publisher=Congressional Quarterly, Inc.|place=Washington, D.C.|year=1985|page=255|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

As noted above, the two situations in which legislative choice has been used since the Civil War have both been because there was not enough time or money to prepare for an election. However, appointment by state legislature can have negative consequences: [[bicameral]] legislatures can deadlock more easily than the electorate. This is precisely what happened to New York in 1789 when the legislature failed to appoint any electors.<ref>{{Cite book|editor-last=Moore|editor-first=John L.|title=Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections|edition=2nd|publisher=Congressional Quarterly, Inc.|place=Washington, D.C.|year=1985|page=254|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

By this method, voters in each district would cast their ballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated by congressional districts. However, the difference stems from the fact that every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to [[gerrymandering]].\n\n=== Proportional vote ===\nUnder such a system, electors would be selected in proportion to the votes cast for their candidate or party, rather than being selected by the statewide plurality vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fairvote.org/e_college/reform.htm#proportional|title=FairVote|publisher=FairVote|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref> \n\n=== Congressional district method ===\nThere are two versions of the congressional district method: one has been implemented in Maine and Nebraska; another has been proposed in Virginia.\nUnder the implemented congressional district method, the electoral votes go to the winner of a plurality of the popular vote winner within each of the states' [[congressional district]]s; the statewide popular vote winner receives two additional electoral votes. While this method may result in a more proportional allocation of electors, this is not necessarily the case. For example, in 1992, [[George H. W. Bush]] won all five of Nebraska's electoral votes with 47% of the vote; in a proportional system, he would have received three and [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ross Perot]] each would have received one. <ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903145758/http://www1.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archivedate=September 3, 2006|title=Fiddling with the Rules|website=Franklin & Marshall College|date=March 9, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a different version of the congressional district method was proposed in Virginia. This version would distribute Virginia's electoral votes based on the popular vote winner within each of Virginia's congressional districts; the two statewide electoral votes would be awarded based on which candidate won the most congressional districts, rather than on who won Virginia's statewide popular vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/republicans-in-virginia-other-states-seeking-electoral-college-changes/2013/01/24/430096e6-6654-11e2-85f5-a8a9228e55e7_story.html|title=Republicans in Virginia, other states seeking electoral college changes|newspaper=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=January 24, 2013|first1=Nia-Malika|last1=Henderson|first2=Errin|last2=Haines|date=January 25, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe congressional district method can more easily be implemented than other alternatives to the winner-takes-all method, in view of major party resistance to relatively enabling third parties under the proportional method.

Populous states in which pre-election poll results show no clear favorite are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers, and debates, while \"four out of five\" voters in the national election are \"absolutely ignored\", according to one assessment.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-end-electoral-college/|title=It's Time to End the Electoral College: Here's how.|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Since most states use a [[Plurality voting system|winner-takes-all]] arrangement in which the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state's electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively on only a few key undecided states; in recent elections, these states have included [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], and [[Florida]] in 2004 and 2008, and included [[Colorado]] in 2012. In contrast, states with large populations such as [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], have in recent elections been considered \"safe\" for a particular party \u2014 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] for California and New York and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for Texas \u2014 and therefore campaigns spend less time and money there. Many small states are also considered to be \"safe\" for one of the two political parties and are also generally ignored by campaigners: of the 13 smallest states, six are reliably Democratic, six are reliably Republican, and only New Hampshire is considered as a swing state, according to critic [[George C.

For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by [[voter suppression]] methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchising]] specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement has no effect on the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend the electoral college system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.\n\nLegal scholars [[Akhil Reed Amar|Akhil Amar]] and [[Vikram Amar]] have argued that the original Electoral College compromise was enacted partially because it enabled Southern states to disenfranchise their slave populations.<ref name=\"amar\">{{Cite journal|last=Amar|first=Akhil|last2=Amar|first2=Vikram|title=The Electoral College Votes Against Equality|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 2004|url=http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415144403/http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality|archivedate=2010-04-15}}</ref> It permitted Southern states to disfranchise large numbers of slaves while allowing these states to maintain political clout within the federation by using the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].

Proponents of the current system argue the collective opinion of even a small state merits attention at the federal level greater than that given to a small, though numerically equivalent, portion of a very populous state. The system also allows each state the freedom, within constitutional bounds, to design its own laws on voting and enfranchisement without an undue incentive to maximize the number of votes cast.\n\nFor many years early in the nation's history, up until the [[Jacksonian Era]], many states appointed their electors by a vote of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], and proponents argue that, in the end, the election of the president must still come down to the decisions of each state, or the federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive, centralized government.<ref name=\"FEC\">{{cite web|author=Kimberling, William C.|title=The Electoral College|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|url=http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf|date=May 1992|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''[[A More Perfect Constitution]]'', Professor [[Larry Sabato]] elaborated on this advantage of the Electoral College, arguing to \"mend it, don't end it,\" in part because of its usefulness in forcing candidates to pay attention to lightly populated states and reinforcing the role of states in federalism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sabato|first=Larry|title=A More Perfect Constitution|publisher=Walker Publishing Company|year=2007|edition=First U.S.|isbn=978-0-8027-1621-7|url=https://archive.org/details/moreperfectconst00saba|accessdate=July 30, 2009|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

This encourages candidates to court a wide variety of such minorities and [[advocacy group]]s.<ref name=\"FEC\" />\n\n==== Encouragement of stability through the two-party system ====\n{{main|Two party system}}\n\nProponents of the Electoral College see its negative effect on [[Third party (politics)|third parties]] as beneficial. They argue that the two party system has provided stability because it encourages a delayed adjustment during times of rapid political and cultural change. They believe it protects the most powerful office in the country from control by what these proponents view as regional minorities until they can moderate their views to win broad, long-term support across the nation. Advocates of a national popular vote for president suggest that this effect would also be true in popular vote elections. Of 918 elections for governor between 1948 and 2009, for example, more than 90% were won by candidates securing more than 50% of the vote, and none have been won with less than 35% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.fairvote.org/majority-and-plurality-in-u-s-gubernatorial-elections Majority and Plurality in U.S. Gubernatorial Elections].

Advocates of the current system argue that human electors would be in a better position to choose a suitable replacement than the general voting public.

Such an amendment, which would abolish the Electoral College, will ensure that the candidate chosen by the voters actually becomes President. Under the Electoral College, it is always possible that the winner of the popular vote will not be elected. This has already happened in three elections, 1824, 1876, and 1888. In the last election, the result could have been changed by a small shift of votes in Ohio and Hawaii, despite a popular vote difference of 1.7 million. I do not recommend a Constitutional amendment lightly. I think the amendment process must be reserved for an issue of overriding governmental significance. But the method by which we elect our President is such an issue. I will not be proposing a specific direct election amendment.

The electors come directly from the people and them alone for that purpose only, and for that time only. This avoided a party-run legislature, or a permanent body that could be influenced by foreign interests before each election.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\">Hamilton. [http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp The Federalist Papers: No. 68] The Avalon Project, Yale Law School. viewed November 10, 2016.</ref> Hamilton explained the election was to take place among all the states, so no corruption in any state could taint \"the great body of the people\" in their selection. The choice was to be made by a majority of the Electoral College, as majority rule is critical to the principles of republican government. Hamilton argued that electors meeting in the state capitals were able to have information unavailable to the general public. Hamilton also argued that since no federal officeholder could be an elector, none of the electors would be beholden to any presidential candidate.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAnother consideration was the decision would be made without \"tumult and disorder\" as it would be a broad-based one made simultaneously in various locales where the decision-makers could deliberate reasonably, not in one place where decision-makers could be threatened or intimidated. If the Electoral College did not achieve a decisive majority, then the House of Representatives was to choose the president from among the top five candidates,<ref>The [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] changed this to the top three candidates</ref> ensuring selection of a presiding officer administering the laws would have both ability and good character. Hamilton was also concerned about somebody unqualified, but with a talent for \"low intrigue, and the little arts of popularity\" attaining high office.<ref name=\"The Federalist Papers: No. 68\"/>\n\nAdditionally, in the [[Federalist No. 10]], James Madison argued against \"an interested and overbearing majority\" and the \"mischiefs of faction\" in an electoral system. He defined a faction as \"a number of citizens whether amounting to a majority or minority of the whole, who are united and actuated by some common impulse of passion, or of interest, adverse to the rights of other citizens, or to the permanent and aggregate interests of the community.\" What was then called republican government (i.e., [[representative democracy]], as opposed to [[direct democracy]]) combined with the principles of [[federalism]] (with distribution of voter rights and separation of government powers) would countervail against factions. Madison further postulated in the Federalist No.{{nbsp}}10 that the greater the population and expanse of the Republic, the more difficulty factions would face in organizing due to such issues as [[sectionalism]].<ref>''The Federalist Papers: Alexander Hamilton, James Madison, John Jay'' The New American Library, 1961</ref>\n\nAlthough the United States Constitution refers to \"Electors\" and \"electors\", neither the phrase \"Electoral College\" nor any other name is used to describe the electors collectively. It was not until the early 19th century the name \"Electoral College\" came into general usage as the collective designation for the electors selected to cast votes for president and vice president. The phrase was first written into federal law in 1845 and today the term appears in {{USC|3|4}}, in the section heading and in the text as \"college of electors\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/faq.html|title=U.

Under the original plan, each elector cast two votes for president; electors did not vote for vice president. Whoever received a majority of votes from the electors would become president, with the person receiving the second most votes becoming vice president.\n\nThe original plan of the Electoral College was based upon several assumptions and anticipations of the Framers of the Constitution:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Stanley|title=Updating the Electoral College: The National Popular Vote Legislation|journal=Harvard Journal on Legislation|volume=44|issue=205, at 208|publisher=President and Fellows of Harvard College|location=Cambridge, MA|year=2007}}</ref>\n# Choice of the president should reflect the \"sense of the people\" at a particular time, not the dictates of a faction in a \"pre-established body\" such as Congress or the State legislatures, and independent of the influence of \"foreign powers\".<ref name=\"auto1\">Hamilton, Alexander.

Hamilton so strongly believed this was to be done district by district, and when states began doing otherwise, he proposed a constitutional amendment to mandate the district system (Hamilton, [https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289 Draft of a Constitutional Amendment]). Madison concurred, \"The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted.\" ([https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023 Madison to Hay, 1823] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|date=May 25, 2017}})</ref>\n# Each presidential elector would exercise independent judgment when voting, deliberating with the most complete information available in a system that over time, tended to bring about a good administration of the laws passed by Congress.<ref name=\"auto1\"/> \n# Candidates would not pair together on the same [[Ticket (election)|ticket]] with assumed placements toward each office of president and vice president.\n# The system as designed would rarely produce a winner, thus sending the presidential election to the House of Representatives.\n\nAccording to the text of Article II, however, each state government was free to have its own plan for selecting its electors, and the Constitution does not explicitly require states to popularly elect their electors. Several methods for selecting electors are described [[United States Electoral College#Alternative methods of choosing electors|below]].\n\n==== Breakdown and revision ====\nThe emergence of [[Political party|political parties]] and nationally coordinated election campaigns soon complicated matters in the elections of [[1796 United States presidential election|1796]] and [[1800 United States presidential election|1800]]. In 1796, [[Federalist Party]] candidate [[John Adams]] won the presidential election. Finishing in second place was [[Democratic-Republican Party]] candidate [[Thomas Jefferson]], the Federalists' opponent, who became the vice president. This resulted in the president and vice president being of different political parties.\n\nIn 1800, the Democratic-Republican Party again nominated Jefferson for president and also nominated [[Aaron Burr]] for vice president. After the electors voted, Jefferson and Burr tied one another with 73 electoral votes each. Since ballots did not distinguish between votes for president and votes for vice president, every ballot cast for Burr technically counted as a vote for him to become president, despite Jefferson clearly being his party's first choice. Lacking a clear winner by constitutional standards, the election had to be decided by the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] pursuant to the Constitution's contingency election provision.\n\nHaving already lost the presidential contest, Federalist Party representatives in the [[Lame duck (politics)|lame duck]] House session seized upon the opportunity to embarrass their opposition by attempting to elect Burr over Jefferson. The House deadlocked for 35 ballots as neither candidate received the necessary majority vote of the state delegations in the House (the votes of nine states were needed for a conclusive election). Jefferson achieved electoral victory on the 36th ballot, but only after Federalist Party leader [[Alexander Hamilton]]\u2014who disfavored Burr's personal character more than Jefferson's policies\u2014had made known his preference for Jefferson.\n\nResponding to the problems from those elections, the Congress proposed on December 9, 1803, and three-fourths of the states ratified by June 15, 1804, the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]]. Starting with the [[1804 United States presidential election|1804 election]], the amendment requires electors cast separate ballots for president and vice president, replacing the system outlined in Article II, Section 1, Clause 3.\n\n=== Evolution to the general ticket ===\n[[Article Two of the United States Constitution#Clause 2: Method of choosing electors|Article II, Section 1, Clause 2]] of the Constitution states:\n{{quote|Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.}}\n\nAlexander Hamilton described the [[Founding Fathers of the United States|Founding Fathers']] view of how electors would be chosen: {{quote|A small number of persons, selected by their fellow-citizens from the general mass, will be most likely to possess the information and discernment requisite to such complicated [tasks].<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\">{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/fed68.asp|title=Federalist No 68|publisher=The Avalon Project}}</ref>}} They assumed this would take place district by district. That plan was carried out by many states until the 1880s. For example, in [[Massachusetts]] in 1820, the rule stated \"the people shall vote by ballot, on which shall be designated who is voted for as an Elector for the district.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0ouAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA245|title=Resolves of the General Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts: Passed at Their Session, which Commenced on Wednesday, the Thirty First of May, and Ended on the Seventeenth of June, One Thousand Eight Hundred and Twenty.

Russell, 1820; [repr|date=January 1, 1820|publisher=Boston Book Company|via=Google Books}}</ref> In other words, the people did not place the name of a candidate for a president on the ballot, instead they voted for their local elector, whom they trusted later to cast a responsible vote for president.\n\nSome states reasoned that the favorite presidential candidate among the people in their state would have a much better chance if all of the electors selected by their state were sure to vote the same way\u2014a \"general ticket\" of electors pledged to a party candidate.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\">Devin McCarthy (Ph.D. Polysci, Duke), [http://www.fairvote.org/how-the-electoral-college-became-winner-take-all \"How the Electoral College Became Winner-Take-All\"]</ref> So the slate of electors chosen by the state were no longer free agents, independent thinkers, or deliberative representatives. They became \"voluntary party lackeys and intellectual non-entities.\"<ref>Chief Justice Robert Jackson, [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/343/214 Ray v. Blair, dissent, 1952]</ref> Once one state took that strategy, the others felt compelled to follow suit in order to compete for the strongest influence on the election.<ref name=\"fairvote.org\"/>\n\nWhen [[James Madison]] and Hamilton, two of the most important architects of the Electoral College, saw this strategy being taken by some states, they protested strongly. Madison and Hamilton both made it clear this approach violated the spirit of the Constitution. According to Hamilton, the selection of the president should be \"made by men most capable of analyzing the qualities adapted to the station [of president].\"<ref name=\"Hamilton, Federalist 68\"/> According to Hamilton, the electors were to analyze the list of potential presidents and select the best one. He also used the term \"deliberate\". Hamilton considered a pre-pledged elector to violate the spirit of Article II of the Constitution insofar as such electors could make no \"analysis\" or \"deliberate\" concerning the candidates. Madison agreed entirely, saying that when the Constitution was written, all of its authors assumed individual electors would be elected in their districts and it was inconceivable a \"general ticket\" of electors dictated by a state would supplant the concept. Madison wrote to George Hay: {{quote|The district mode was mostly, if not exclusively in view when the Constitution was framed and adopted; & was exchanged for the general ticket [many years later].<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\">{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|title=Founders Online: James Madison to George Hay, 23 August 1823|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170525182347/https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Madison/99-02-02-0023|archivedate=May 25, 2017|df=mdy-all}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Founding Fathers assumed that each elector would be elected by the citizens of a district and that elector was to be free to analyze and deliberate regarding who is best suited to be president.\n\nMadison and Hamilton were so upset by what they saw as a distortion of the original intent that they advocated a constitutional amendment to prevent anything other than the district plan: \"the election of Presidential Electors by districts, is an amendment very proper to be brought forward,\" Madison told George Hay in 1823.<ref name=\"Madison to Hay, 1823\"/> Hamilton went further. He actually drafted an amendment to the Constitution mandating the district plan for selecting electors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-25-02-0289|title=Founders Online: Draft of a Resolution for the Legislature of New York for the{{nbsp}}...|website=founders.archives.gov}}</ref> However, Hamilton's [[Burr-Hamilton duel|untimely death]] in 1804 prevented him from advancing his proposed reforms any further.\n\n=== Evolution of selection plans ===\nIn 1789, at-large popular vote, the winner-take-all method, began with Pennsylvania and Maryland; Virginia and Delaware used a district plan by popular vote, and in the five other states participating in the election (Connecticut, Georgia, New Hampshire, New Jersey, and South Carolina),<ref>{{cite web|title=1788 Election For the First Term, 1789\u20131793|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/votes/1789_1821.html#1788|website=U.

Beginning with the first census, Electoral College votes repeatedly eclipsed the electoral basis supporting slave-power in the choice of the U.S. president.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130103115308/http://history.house.gov/Institution/Apportionment/Apportionment/ Apportionment by State (PDF)], House of Representatives, History, Art & Archives, viewed January 27, 2019. Unlike the votes taken in the Electoral College, from 1803 to 1846, the U.S. Senate sustained parity between free-soil and slave-holding states. But subsequently, an unbroken chain of free-soil states, including Iowa, Wisconsin, California, Minnesota, Oregon and Kansas, were admitted before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].</ref>\n\nAt the Constitution, the Electoral College was authorized a majority of 49 votes for northern states in the process of abolishing slavery, and 42 votes for slave-holding states (including Delaware). In the event, the first 1788 presidential election did not include Electoral College votes for unratified Rhode Island (3) and North Carolina (7), nor for New York (8) which reported too late; the Northern majority was 38 to 35.<ref>[https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution-transcript U.S. Constitution Transcript], held at the U.S. National Archives, viewed online on February 5, 2019.</ref> Then for the first two decades of census apportionment in the Electoral College, in 1790 and in 1800, the Three-fifths clause awarded free-soil Northern states narrow majorities of 8% and 11% as the Southern states in [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Convention]] had given up two-fifths of their slave population in their federal apportionment compromise.

The seats that the South gained from a slave bonus were evenly distributed between the parties of the period.

Then Andrew Jackson won in 1828, but that second campaign would also have been lost if the count in the Electoral College were by citizen-only apportionment alone. Scholars conclude that in the 1828 race, Jackson benefited materially from the Three-fifths clause by providing his margin of victory. The impact of the Three-fifths clause in both Jefferson's first and Jackson's first presidential elections was significant because each of them launched sustained Congressional party majorities over several Congresses, as well as presidential party eras.<ref>Brian D.

Although [[ballot]]s list the names of the presidential and vice presidential candidates (who run on a [[ticket (election)|ticket]]), voters actually choose electors when they vote for president and vice president.

Electors usually vote for the nominees of their party to whom they have been pledged, but some \"[[faithless elector]]s\" have voted for other candidates or refrained from voting.\n\nA candidate must receive an [[absolute majority]] of electoral votes (currently 270) to win the presidency or the vice presidency. If no candidate receives a majority in the election for president or vice president, the election is determined via a [[#Contingencies|contingency procedure]] established by the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]].

In some states, such as [[Oklahoma]], [[Virginia]], and [[North Carolina]], electors are nominated in party conventions.

The meeting is opened by the election certification official \u2013 often that state's [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]] or equivalent \u2014 who reads the Certificate of Ascertainment. This document sets forth who was chosen to cast the electoral votes. The attendance of the electors is taken and any vacancies are noted in writing. The next step is the selection of a president or chairman of the meeting, sometimes also with a vice chairman. The electors sometimes choose a secretary, often not himself an elector, to take the minutes of the meeting. In many states, political officials give short speeches at this point in the proceedings.\n\nWhen the time for balloting arrives, the electors choose one or two people to act as tellers. Some states provide for the placing in nomination of a candidate to receive the electoral votes (the candidate for president of the political party of the electors). Each elector submits a written ballot with the name of a candidate for president. Ballot formats vary between the states: in [[New Jersey]] for example, the electors cast ballots by checking the name of the candidate on a pre-printed card; in [[North Carolina]], the electors write the name of the candidate on a blank card. The tellers count the ballots and announce the result. The next step is the casting of the vote for vice president, which follows a similar pattern.\n\nEach state's electors must complete six Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must be signed by all of the electors and a Certificate of Ascertainment must be attached to each of the Certificates of Vote. Each Certificate of Vote must include the names of those who received an electoral vote for either the office of president or of vice president. The electors certify the Certificates of Vote and copies of the Certificates are then sent in the following fashion:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|title=U.S. Electoral College \u2013 For State Officials|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=November 7, 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025053914/http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/electoral-college/state_responsibilities.html#vote|archivedate=October 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n* One is sent by [[registered mail]] to the [[President of the Senate]] (who usually is the incumbent [[vice president of the United States]]);\n* Two are sent by registered mail to the [[Archivist of the United States]];\n* Two are sent to the state's Secretary of State; and\n* One is sent to the chief judge of the [[United States district court]] where those electors met.\n\nA staff member of the President of the Senate collects the Certificates of Vote as they arrive and prepares them for the joint session of the Congress.

The vice president and the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] sit at the podium, with the vice president in the seat of the Speaker of the House. Senate pages bring in the two mahogany boxes containing each state's certified vote and place them on tables in front of the senators and representatives. Each house appoints two tellers to count the vote (normally one member of each political party). Relevant portions of the certificate of vote are read for each state, in alphabetical order.\n\nMembers of Congress can object to any state's vote count, provided objection is presented in writing and is signed by at least one member of each house of Congress. An objection supported by at least one senator and one representative will be followed by the suspension of the joint session and by separate debates and votes in each House of Congress; after both Houses deliberate on the objection, the joint session is resumed. \n\nA state's certificate of vote can be rejected only if both Houses of Congress vote to accept the objection, meaning the votes from the State in question are not counted. Individual votes can also be rejected, and are also not counted. \n\nIn [[1864 United States presidential election|1864]], all of the votes from Louisiana and Tennessee were rejected, and in [[1872 United States presidential election|1872]], all of the votes from Arkansas and Louisiana plus three of the eleven electoral votes  from Georgia were rejected. <ref>{{cite book|author=David A.

Bush of Texas and the vice president of the United States, Al Gore. Gore, who as vice president was required to preside over his own Electoral College defeat (by five electoral votes), denied the objections, all of which were raised by only several representatives and would have favored his candidacy, after no senators would agree to jointly object. Objections were again raised in the vote count of the 2004 elections, and on that occasion the document was presented by one representative and one senator. Although the joint session was suspended, the objections were quickly disposed of and rejected by both Houses of Congress. \n\nIf there are no objections or all objections are overruled, the presiding officer simply includes a state's votes, as declared in the certificate of vote, in the official tally.\n\nAfter the certificates from all states are read and the respective votes are counted, the presiding officer simply announces the final result of the vote and, provided the required absolute majority of votes was achieved, declares the names of the persons elected president and vice president. This announcement concludes the joint session and formalizes the recognition of the president-elect and of the vice president-elect. The senators then depart from the House Chamber. The final tally is printed in the Senate and House journals.\n\n=== Contingencies ===\n{{further|Contingent election}}\n\n==== Contingent presidential election by House ====\nThe [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]] requires the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to go into session immediately to vote for a president if no candidate for president receives a majority of the electoral votes (since 1964, 270 of the 538 electoral votes).\n\nIn this event, the House of Representatives is limited to choosing from among the three candidates who received the most electoral votes for president. Each state delegation votes ''en bloc'' \u2014 each delegation having a single vote; the District of Columbia does not get to vote. A candidate must receive an absolute majority of state delegation votes (i.e., at present, a minimum of 26 votes) in order for that candidate to become the ''president-elect''. Additionally, delegations from at least two thirds of all the states must be present for voting to take place. The House continues balloting until it elects a president.\n\nThe House of Representatives has chosen the president only twice: in [[1800 United States presidential election|1801]] under Article II, Section 1, Clause 3; and in [[1824 United States presidential election|1825]] under the Twelfth Amendment.\n\n==== Contingent vice presidential election by Senate ====\nIf no candidate for vice president receives an absolute majority of electoral votes, then the [[United States Senate|Senate]] must go into session to elect a vice president. The Senate is limited to choosing from the two candidates who received the most electoral votes for vice president. Normally this would mean two candidates, one less than the number of candidates available in the House vote. However, the text is written in such a way that ''all'' candidates with the most and second most electoral votes are eligible for the Senate election \u2013 this number could theoretically be larger than two. The Senate votes in the normal manner in this case (i.e., ballots are individually cast by each senator, not by state delegations). However, two-thirds of the senators must be present for voting to take place.\n\nAdditionally, the Twelfth Amendment states a \"majority of the whole number\" of senators (currently 51 of 100) is necessary for election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm#_1_8|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628231654/http://www.ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/government/gov-39.cfm|archivedate=June 28, 2011|title=RL30804: The Electoral College: An Overview and Analysis of Reform Proposals, L.

In that instance, the Senate adopted an alphabetical [[Voting methods in deliberative assemblies|roll call]] and voting aloud. The rules further stated, \"[I]f a majority of the number of senators shall vote for either the said [[Richard Mentor Johnson|Richard M. Johnson]] or [[Francis Granger]], he shall be declared by the presiding officer of the Senate constitutionally elected Vice President of the United States\"; the Senate chose Johnson.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsj&fileName=026/llsj026.db&recNum=228&itemLink=r%3Fammem%2Fhlaw%3A@field%28DOCID%2B@lit%28sj0262%29%29%3A%230260003&linkText=1|title=Senate Journal from 1837|publisher=Memory.loc.gov|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==== Deadlocked election ====\nSection 3 of the [[Twentieth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twentieth Amendment]] specifies if the House of Representatives has not chosen a ''president-elect'' in time for the inauguration (noon [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]] on January 20), then the ''vice president-elect'' becomes [[Acting President of the United States|acting president]] until the House selects a president. Section{{nbsp}}3 also specifies Congress may statutorily provide for who will be acting president if there is neither a president-elect nor a vice president-elect in time for the inauguration. Under the [[Presidential Succession Act#Presidential Succession Act of 1947|Presidential Succession Act of 1947]], the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] would become acting president until either the House selects a president or the Senate selects a vice president. Neither of these situations has ever occurred.\n\n=== Current electoral vote distribution ===\n{{see also|Electoral vote changes between United States presidential elections}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Electoral votes (EV) allocations for the 2012, 2016 and 2020 presidential elections.<ref name=\"2010census01\">{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/news/pdf/apport2010_map1.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124045725/http://2010.census.gov/news/pdf/apport2010_map1.pdf|archivedate=2011-01-24|title=Apportionment of the U.S. House of Representatives Based on the 2010 Census|date=December 21, 2010|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau|location=Washington, D.C.|accessdate=December 21, 2010}} Each state's number of electoral votes is equal to its total congressional representation (its number of Representatives plus its two Senators).</ref><br />Triangular markers {{nowrap|(<sup>{{increase}}{{decrease}}</sup>)}} indicate gains or losses following the 2010 Census.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/Census10/HouseAndElectors.phtml|title=2010 Census: State Population and the Distribution of Electoral Votes and Representatives|website=The Green Papers}}</ref>\n!

The general ticket is quite similar to the current system and is often confused with it. In the general ticket, voters cast ballots for individuals running for presidential elector (while in the short ballot, voters cast ballots for an entire slate of electors). In the general ticket, the state canvass would report the number of votes cast for each candidate for elector, a complicated process in states like New York with multiple positions to fill. Both the general ticket and the short ballot are often considered at-large or winner-takes-all voting. The short ballot was adopted by the various states at different times; it was adopted for use by [[North Carolina]] and [[Ohio]] in 1932. [[Alabama]] was still using the general ticket as late as 1960 and was one of the last states to switch to the short ballot.\n\nThe question of the extent to which state constitutions may constrain the legislature's choice of a method of choosing electors has been touched on in two U.S. Supreme Court cases. In ''[[McPherson v. Blacker]]'', {{ussc|146|1|1892}}, the Court cited Article II, Section 1, Clause{{nbsp}}2 which states that a state's electors are selected \"in such manner as the legislature thereof may direct\" and wrote these words \"operat[e] as a limitation upon the state in respect of any attempt to circumscribe the legislative power\".

By this method, voters in each district would cast their ballots for the electors they supported and the winner in each district would become the elector. This was similar to how states are currently separated by congressional districts. However, the difference stems from the fact that every state always had two more electoral districts than congressional districts. As with congressional districts, moreover, this method is vulnerable to [[gerrymandering]].\n\n=== Proportional vote ===\nUnder such a system, electors would be selected in proportion to the votes cast for their candidate or party, rather than being selected by the statewide plurality vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.fairvote.org/e_college/reform.htm#proportional|title=FairVote|publisher=FairVote|accessdate=August 14, 2014}}</ref> \n\n=== Congressional district method ===\nThere are two versions of the congressional district method: one has been implemented in Maine and Nebraska; another has been proposed in Virginia.\nUnder the implemented congressional district method, the electoral votes go to the winner of a plurality of the popular vote winner within each of the states' [[congressional district]]s; the statewide popular vote winner receives two additional electoral votes. While this method may result in a more proportional allocation of electors, this is not necessarily the case. For example, in 1992, [[George H. W. Bush]] won all five of Nebraska's electoral votes with 47% of the vote; in a proportional system, he would have received three and [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ross Perot]] each would have received one. <ref name=\"autogenerated3\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060903145758/http://www1.fandm.edu/x6441.xml|archivedate=September 3, 2006|title=Fiddling with the Rules|website=Franklin & Marshall College|date=March 9, 2005|accessdate=August 26, 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a different version of the congressional district method was proposed in Virginia.

Conversely, the institutional structure of a national popular vote system would encourage candidates to pursue voter turnout wherever votes could be found, even in \"safe\" states they are already expected to win, and in \"safe\" states they have no hope of winning.\n\n==== Exclusive focus on large swing states ====\n{{main|Swing state}}\n[[File:2004CampaignAttention (edit).png|right|thumb|upright=1.35|<span>These maps show the amount of attention given to each state by the [[George W.

Populous states in which pre-election poll results show no clear favorite are inundated with campaign visits, saturation television advertising, get-out-the-vote efforts by party organizers, and debates, while \"four out of five\" voters in the national election are \"absolutely ignored\", according to one assessment.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/its-time-end-electoral-college/|title=It's Time to End the Electoral College: Here's how.|journal=[[The Nation]]|date=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Since most states use a [[Plurality voting system|winner-takes-all]] arrangement in which the candidate with the most votes in that state receives all of the state's electoral votes, there is a clear incentive to focus almost exclusively on only a few key undecided states; in recent elections, these states have included [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ohio]], and [[Florida]] in 2004 and 2008, and included [[Colorado]] in 2012. In contrast, states with large populations such as [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[New York (state)|New York]], have in recent elections been considered \"safe\" for a particular party \u2014 [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] for California and New York and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] for Texas \u2014 and therefore campaigns spend less time and money there. Many small states are also considered to be \"safe\" for one of the two political parties and are also generally ignored by campaigners: of the 13 smallest states, six are reliably Democratic, six are reliably Republican, and only New Hampshire is considered as a swing state, according to critic [[George C.

The differences in turnout between swing states and non-swing states under the current electoral college system suggest that replacing the Electoral College with direct election by popular vote would likely increase turnout and participation significantly.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==== Obscuring disenfranchisement within states ====\nAccording to this criticism, the electoral college reduces elections to a mere count of electors for a particular state, and, as a result, it obscures any voting problems ''within'' a particular state. For example, if a particular state blocks some groups from voting, perhaps by [[voter suppression]] methods such as imposing reading tests, poll taxes, registration requirements, or legally [[Disfranchisement|disfranchising]] specific minority groups, then voting inside that state would be reduced, but as the state's electoral count would be the same, disenfranchisement has no effect on the overall electoral tally. Critics contend that such disenfranchisement is partially obscured by the Electoral College. A related argument is the Electoral College may have a dampening effect on voter turnout: there is no incentive for states to reach out to more of its citizens to include them in elections because the state's electoral count remains fixed in any event. According to this view, if elections were by popular vote, then states would be motivated to include more citizens in elections since the state would then have more political clout nationally. Critics contend the electoral college system insulates states from negative publicity as well as possible federal penalties for disenfranching subgroups of citizens.\n\nLegal scholars [[Akhil Reed Amar|Akhil Amar]] and [[Vikram Amar]] have argued that the original Electoral College compromise was enacted partially because it enabled Southern states to disenfranchise their slave populations.<ref name=\"amar\">{{Cite journal|last=Amar|first=Akhil|last2=Amar|first2=Vikram|title=The Electoral College Votes Against Equality|journal=Los Angeles Times|date=September 9, 2004|url=http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100415144403/http://www.fairvote.org/the-electoral-college-votes-against-equality|archivedate=2010-04-15}}</ref> It permitted Southern states to disfranchise large numbers of slaves while allowing these states to maintain political clout within the federation by using the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]].

The system also allows each state the freedom, within constitutional bounds, to design its own laws on voting and enfranchisement without an undue incentive to maximize the number of votes cast.\n\nFor many years early in the nation's history, up until the [[Jacksonian Era]], many states appointed their electors by a vote of the [[State legislature (United States)|state legislature]], and proponents argue that, in the end, the election of the president must still come down to the decisions of each state, or the federal nature of the United States will give way to a single massive, centralized government.<ref name=\"FEC\">{{cite web|author=Kimberling, William C.|title=The Electoral College|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|url=http://www.fec.gov/pdf/eleccoll.pdf|date=May 1992|accessdate=January 3, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn his book ''[[A More Perfect Constitution]]'', Professor [[Larry Sabato]] elaborated on this advantage of the Electoral College, arguing to \"mend it, don't end it,\" in part because of its usefulness in forcing candidates to pay attention to lightly populated states and reinforcing the role of states in federalism.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sabato|first=Larry|title=A More Perfect Constitution|publisher=Walker Publishing Company|year=2007|edition=First U.S.|isbn=978-0-8027-1621-7|url=https://archive.org/details/moreperfectconst00saba|accessdate=July 30, 2009|postscript=<!-- Bot inserted parameter.

They believe it protects the most powerful office in the country from control by what these proponents view as regional minorities until they can moderate their views to win broad, long-term support across the nation. Advocates of a national popular vote for president suggest that this effect would also be true in popular vote elections. Of 918 elections for governor between 1948 and 2009, for example, more than 90% were won by candidates securing more than 50% of the vote, and none have been won with less than 35% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.fairvote.org/majority-and-plurality-in-u-s-gubernatorial-elections Majority and Plurality in U.S. Gubernatorial Elections].

If no pair received 40% of the popular vote, a runoff election would be held in which the choice of president and vice president would be made from the two pairs of persons who had received the highest number of votes in the first election.

The letter read in part:{{quote|My fourth recommendation is that the Congress adopt a Constitutional amendment to provide for direct popular election of the President. Such an amendment, which would abolish the Electoral College, will ensure that the candidate chosen by the voters actually becomes President. Under the Electoral College, it is always possible that the winner of the popular vote will not be elected. This has already happened in three elections, 1824, 1876, and 1888. In the last election, the result could have been changed by a small shift of votes in Ohio and Hawaii, despite a popular vote difference of 1.7 million. I do not recommend a Constitutional amendment lightly. I think the amendment process must be reserved for an issue of overriding governmental significance. But the method by which we elect our President is such an issue. I will not be proposing a specific direct election amendment. I prefer to allow the Congress to proceed with its work without the interruption of a new proposal.<ref>''[http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=7218.

Because, mostly, it is, and because to the extent it tells the story of two real people, it also adorns the telling with dramatic practicalities, invented characters and narrative detours. Indeed, it's down these side streets, casting a brief light on a passing character (patients, prostitutes, a provost's wife), that the show finds many of its best moments.\"<ref name=\"lat2013\"/>\n\nOther than principal characters, which are partly fictionalized, adults are significantly fictionalized; however, children are entirely fictionalized. In real life, Masters and Johnson each have two children, however, in the series they have three children each. Episodes featuring the children include a disclaimer where it states that their storylines are \"entirely fictitious\". Series creator Michelle Ashford explained, \"We are telling a non-fiction story and one where there are people who are still alive out there, and those people need to be protected. We were advised to add [the baby] to protect the people that are still alive. It wasn't a storytelling prerogative. It had to do with protecting living people.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tvguide.com/news/masters-of-sex-fake-baby/ |title=The Kids Aren't Alright: Behind Masters of Sex's Controversial Children's Stories |website=TV Guide |first=Hanh |last=Nguyen |date=August 11, 2015 |accessdate=January 4, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n[[File:Cast of Masters of Sex at PaleyFest 2014.jpg|thumb|The cast and crew at [[PaleyFest]] 2014.
