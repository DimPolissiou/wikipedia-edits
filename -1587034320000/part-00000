As such, the written name ''kurios'' took on a whole new aura of significance. [...] [Hence arose] a special way of writing the divine name ''kurios'' in Greek. The result was {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}, a contracted form, using the first and last letters of ''kurios''. Interestingly, a transitional stage\u2014between writing YHWH and {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}\u2014can be witnessed in [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 656]]. (Though this codex is dated to the second century AD, it probably represents earlier practice.) [...] the original scribe left a four-letter space open [...] for someone else to fill in the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew. But it was not filled in with the Tetragrammaton. Instead, the divine name was squeezed in by another scribe with the name \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. Evidently, there was no one qualified to fill in the space with the archaic-Hebrew form, so it was filled in with the Greek surrogate.\" He then pictures a situation where the second scribe filled in the empty space not with \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 but with {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}, and in support quotes [[Harry Y. Gamble]], who, \"following G.

These Old Testament writings could have been books of the Old Testament [...] [or] collections of testimonia\u2014i.e., excerpts of Old Testament passages (with commentary) that Christians compiled as proof texts for Christian claims and that the early Christian writers used for providing quotations in their writings, such as we see in Matthew's Gospel.\" {{sfn|Comfort|2005|pp=210\u2013211}} Howard, on the other hand, supposed that the New Testament writers took their quotations directly from Septuagint manuscripts (which he also supposed to have the Hebrew tetragrammaton), not from the handier testimonia. which might already have nomina sacra.\n\nRecognizing that \"the earliest extant testimony for the nomina sacra does not come from the Testimonia but from continuous Old Testament texts\" of the early second century, Comfort states: \"Regardless of whether the nomina sacra were invented in the testimonia stage or in early Christian Greek Old Testament manuscripts (i.e., first century), the significance is that they may have existed in written form before the Gospels and Epistles were written. As such, some of the New Testament writers themselves could have adopted these forms when they wrote their books. The presence of the nomina sacra in all the earliest Christian manuscripts dating from the early second century necessitates that it was a widespread practice established much earlier. If we place the origin of that practice to the autographs and/or early publications of the New Testament writings, it explains the universal proliferation thereafter.\"{{sfn|Comfort|2005|p=211}}\n\nGeorge Howard proposes that the change to the ''nomina sacra'' {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}} and {{overline|\u03b8\u03c2}} instead of YHWH in Christian copies of the Septuagint took place \"at least by the beginning of the second century\": it began \"towards the end of the first century\", and \"somewhere around the beginning of the second century [...] must have crowded out the Tetragram in both Testaments\".<ref name=Howard2/> Already by the late second century ''nomina sacra'' were used not only in New Testament manuscripts but also in inscriptions in [[Lycaonia]] (modern central Turkey).<ref>{{cite book|title=Early Christianity in Lycaonia and Adjacent Areas: From Paul to Amphilochius of Iconium, Early Christianity in Asia Minor|author=Cilliers Breytenbach, Christiane Zimmermann|publisher=BRILL|year=2018|url=https://books.google.com.gt/books?id=ztBCDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA14#v=onepage&q&f=false |quote=Following the usage in Greek New Testament manuscripts, abbreviation of ''nomina sacra'' occurs as early as the late 2nd century|isbn= 9789004352520}}</ref> [[David Trobisch]] proposes that the replacement of ''YHWH'' to ''nomina sacra'' was a conscious editorial decision at the time of compiling both New and Old Testaments, in the second century.{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=89}}{{sfn|Trobisch|2000|pp=19}}\n\n== Tables related to \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 in the New Testament ==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!colspan=6|Forms corresponding to the MT Tetragrammaton in some Greek OT and NT manuscripts\n|-https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Names_and_titles_of_God_in_the_New_Testament&action=history\n|'''Date'''\n|'''LXX/OG mss'''\n|'''Forms in LXX/OG mss'''\n|'''NT mss'''\n|'''Forms in NT mss'''\n|-\n|1st century BCE \n|4Q120 <br> P.

[[George Howard (Hebraist)|George Howard]] published in 1977 a thesis that Robert F. Shedinger calls \"somewhat speculative\", and whose \"revolutionary theological ramifications\" Howard himself drew out. He proposed that the original texts of the New Testament had \"YHWH\" (either in Hebrew characters or in a Greek transliteration) in their quotations from the Old Testament, but not elsewhere, and that it was replaced in the copies made during the second century.{{sfn|Shedinger|2001|pp=138}}\n\nDidier Fontaine observes that Howard's postulate is built on three further suppositions:\n{{quote|[Howard's] thesis boils down to simply this: it is possible that when quoting the OT, the NT authors retained the tetragram in their writings where it figured in the Greek text [i.e., the [[Septuagint]]]. Three observations allow this postulate: 1) the translators of the LXX retained the divine name in Hebrew or paleo-Hebrew in the Greek text\u2014that, at least, is what the manuscripts of the pre-Christian era indicate; 2) it was the Christians, not the Jews, who replaced these instances of the name with \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; and 3) the textual tradition of the NT contains variants that are explained well in this context.\"{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11}}}}\n\nIn his concluding observations, Howard, recognizing \"the revolutionary nature\" of his thesis that at one time the tetragrammaton was employed in the New Testament, said that, if true, it would require further explanation on various questions:\n\n{{quote|If the Tetragram was used in the NT, how extensively was it used? Was it confined to OT quotations and OT paraphrastic allusions, or was it used in traditional phrases, such as \"the word of God / Lord\" (see the variants in Acts 6:7; 8:25; 12:24; 13:5; 13:44, 48; 14:25; 16:6, 32), \"in the day of the Lord\" (cf. variants in 1 Cor 5:5), \"through the will of God\" (cf. variants in Rom 15:32)? Was it also used in OT-like narratives such as we have in the first two chapters of Luke?{{sfn|Howard|1977|pp=82}}}}\n\nFontaine continues: \"The thesis of Howard has generally aroused negative reactions, like those of [[Carroll D. Osburn|C. Osburn]], [[Donald Juel|D. Juel]] or [[Bruce M. Metzger]]. In the case of Metzger, [Frank] Shaw shows how Howard's thesis has perhaps been distorted and cited in the wrong way.\" Fontaine indicates that dictation, in which what was communicated was the ''spoken'' equivalent of the Tetragrammaton, generally a surrogate (such as ''kurios'', not the Tetragrammaton itself) shows that the text of a Septuagint manuscript or of an original letter of [[Paul the Apostle]] could differ from that in an existing copy of the Septuagint and would thus explain the textual variations adduced in support of Howard's thesis.{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11-12}}\n\nRobert J. Wilkinson rejects Howard's hypothesis: \"It is not possible to assert that all Jewish Greek biblical manuscripts had the Tetragrammaton, nor for that matter that someone reading a Tetragrammaton in a biblical text would necessarily transcribe it into another text as such rather than as, say, ''kurios'' [...}  this conjectured account has Christians initially quoting biblical texts in their own writings to make a clear distinction between Christ and Yhwh and then introducing 'confusion' by deciding to eliminate the Tetragrammaton from their own works. One may ask why they would do that and when.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=94}} He says that Howard's article was influential with regard to certain \"denominational interests\", whom he identifies as those of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], whose enthusiastic response perhaps somewhat obscured the clarity of the situation (incompatible with those sectarian positions) of \"total absence of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton from all recovered early Christian Greek New Testament manuscripts and their texts\".{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=92\u201393}}\n\nLarry W. Hurtado remarks: \"Against the contentions of a few (e.g., George Howard), these remarkable developments [\"at a remarkably early point the exalted Jesus was associated with YHWH, such that practices and texts that originally applied to YHWH were 'extended' (so to speak) to include Jesus as the further referent\"] cannot be ascribed to some sort of textual confusion brought on by a supposedly later copyist practice of writing 'Kyrios' in place of YHWH in Greek biblical manuscripts. The developments in question exploded so early and so quickly to render any such a proposal irrelevant.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Larry W.

While in non-biblical material Jews freely used either the Tetragrammaton or a substitute such as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, in copying the biblical text itself they carefully guarded the Tetragrammaton, a practice that they extended to translation into Greek but not into Aramaic (p.&nbsp;72); but, Howard said, in the earliest extant copies of the Christian LXX the tetragrammaton is not to be found and is almost universally replaced by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (p.&nbsp;74). \"In all probability\", he said, \"the Tetragram in the Christian LXX began to be surrogated with the contracted words {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}} and {{overline|\u03b8\u03c2}} at least by the beginning of the second century\" (pp.&nbsp;74\u221275). \"Towards the end of the first century\", he said, \"Gentile Christians [...] substituted the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 [...] for the Tetragram\" (pp.&nbsp;76\u221277). Howard's theory was that, in the interval between the writing of the texts that were later compiled to form the New Testament and the adoption of these surrogates, quotations in those texts would have the Tetragrammaton: \"It is reasonable to believe that the NT writers, when quoting from Scripture, preserved the Tetragram within the biblical text. On the analogy of pre-Christian Jewish practice we can imagine that the NT text incorporated the Tetragram into its OT quotations and that the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 were used when secondary references to God were made in the comments that were based upon the quotations. The Tetragram in these quotations would, of course, have remained as long as it continued to be used in the Christian copies of the LXX. But when it was removed from the Greek OT, it was also removed from the quotations of the OT in the NT. Thus somewhere around the beginning of the second century the use of surrogates must have crowded out the Tetragram in both Testaments\" (p.&nbsp;77).{{sfn|Howard|1977|pp=77}}\n\nIn the following year 1978, Howard wrote in the popular-style [[Biblical Archaeology Review]]: \"I offer the following scenario of the history of the Tetragrammaton in the Greek Bible as a whole, including both testaments. First, as to the Old Testament- Jewish scribes always preserved the Tetragrammaton in their copies of the Septuagint both before and after the New Testament period. In all probability Jewish Christians wrote the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew as well. Toward the end of the first Christian century, when the church had become predominantly Gentile, the motive for retaining the Hebrew name for God was lost and the words kyrios and theos were substituted for it in Christian copies of Old Testament Septuagints. Both kyrios and theos were written in abbreviated form in a conscious effort to preserve the sacred nature of the divine name. Soon the original significance of the contractions was lost and many other contracted words were added. A similar pattern probably evolved with respect to the New Testament. ''When the Septuagint which the New Testament church used and quoted contained the Hebrew form of the divine name, the New Testament writers no doubt included the Tetragrammaton in their quotations.'' But when the Hebrew form for the divine name was eliminated in favor of Greek substitutes in the Septuagint, it was eliminated also from the New Testament quotations of the Septuagint.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=George Howard|title=The Name of God in the New Testament.

Hurtado]] stated that scholars are divided on their interpretation of the manuscript evidence on the Septuagint: \"In Septuagint manuscripts (dating from ca. 3rd century CE and later), \"Kyrios\" (Greek: \"Lord\") is used rather frequently. But some have proposed that the earliest practice was fairly consistently to translate YHWH with \"Kyrios\" (\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), others that the Hebrew divine name was initially rendered phonetically as \u0399\u0391\u03a9 (\"Iao\"), and others that the divine name was originally retained in Hebrew characters. To my knowledge, the most recent discussion of the matter is the recent journal article by Martin R\u00f6sel\".<ref name=\"Hurtado2013\">{{cite web|author=Larry Hurtado|website=Larry Hurtado's Blog|date=July 3, 2013|url=https://larryhurtado.wordpress.com/2013/07/03/the-divine-name-and-greek-translation/|title=The Divine Name and Greek Translation}}</ref>\n \nMartin R\u00f6sel holds that the Septuagint used \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 to represent the Tetragrammaton of the Hebrew text and that the appearance of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton in some copies of the Septuagint is due to a later substitution for the original \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2: \"By means of exegetical observations in the Greek version of the [[Torah]], it becomes clear that already the translators of the Septuagint have chosen 'Lord' (''kyrios'') as an appropriate representation of the ''tetragrammaton''; the replacement by the Hebrew ''tetragrammaton'' in some Greek manuscripts is not original.\"{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=411}} He recalls that, although \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was obviously the name that early Christians read in their Greek Bible, \"Jewish versions of the Greek Bible, including Aquila and Symmachus as well as a few LXX manuscripts,\" had the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew letters or the form \u03a0\u0399\u03a0\u0399 imitating Hebrew \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 and also recalls the arguments for the originality of the Greek transcription \u0399\u0391\u03a9.{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=414\u2013419}} However, in view of the inconclusive nature of the analysis of the manuscripts, he proposes evidence internal to the Septuagint text that suggests that \"\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 is the original representation of the first translators\", delimiting his research in this matter to the Pentateuch texts, since these were the earliest and provide a glimpse of a translator's theological thinking,{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=419}} for, as he said earlier, \"the translators of the Septuagint were influenced by theological considerations when choosing an equivalent for the divine name\".{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=411}} In some contexts, to avoid giving the impression of injustice or harshness on the part of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, they represent the Tetragrammaton instead by \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2.{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=420}} Thus the immediate context explains the use of \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 as avoidance of the default translation as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2,{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=421\u2013422}} while \"it is hardly conceivable that later scribes should have changed a Hebrew ''tetragrammaton'' or Greek \u0399\u0391\u03a9 into a form of \u1f41 \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2\".{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=424}} The presence of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the [[deuterocanonical books]] not translated from Hebrew but composed originally (like the New Testament) in Greek and in the works of Philo shows, R\u00f6sel says, that \"the use of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 as a representation of \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 must be pre-Christian in origin\".{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=425}} He adds that this use was not universal among Jews, as shown by the later replacement of the original Septuaginta \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 by the Hebrew Tetragrammaton; and he says that \"the \u0399\u0391\u03a9 readings in the biblical manuscript 4QLXXLevb are a mystery still awaiting sound explanation. What can be said, is that such readings cannot be claimed to be original.\"{{sfn|R\u00f6sel|2007|pp=425}}\n\nAlbert Pietersma is another of the scholars who hold that the Septuagint Pentateuch originally contained \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, and that the hebraizing insertion of the tetragrammaton in some copies can be seen as \"a secondary and foreign intrusion into LXX tradition\".{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=90}} He therefore takes issue with Howard's claim that \"we can now say with almost absolute certainty that the divine name, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, was not rendered by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the pre-Christian Bible\".\n\nDominique Gonnet, says that \"there are actually several textual forms of the [Septuagint]: the old LXX, the LXX realigned on the Hebrew before the Christian era and at the beginning of this one [...] There are also Jewish revisions of the LXX undertaken during the turn of the Christian era [...] New Testament writers often quote the old LXX, but sometimes they use an LXX that has evolved from the older LXX.

They state: \"The typical LXX rendering of the Tetragrammaton as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 must have extended back into the pre-Christian era, although there is no evidence for it in the early manuscripts\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=T2w9AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA105&dq=Wurthwein+%22typical+lxx%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjxxMTgwMXjAhWVh1wKHa3PBVwQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&q=Wurthwein%20%22typical%20lxx%22&f=false Ernst Wurthwein, Alexander Achilles Fischer, ''The Text of the Old Testament: An Introduction to the Biblia Hebraica'' (Eerdmans 2014), p. 105]</ref>\n\nM\u00aa V\u00aa Spottorno y D\u00edaz Caro writes that one cannot rule out the possibility that the expression \"Lord\" (\u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in Greek, \u05de\u05e8\u05d0 in Aramaic) as the name of God was already in use among Jews at about the time when the Septuagint was created.

She suggests that it came from use of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 for \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 by Greek-speaking Palestinian Jews, and she cites Howard's assertion that from at least the third century BCE \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 was used in speech for \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, as suggested also by Qumran manuscripts of Ben Sira and Psalm 151 and by Philo's use of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 for \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 in his Old Testament quotations. She accepts that the evidence comes from manuscripts of the Christian era and is therefore inconclusive, but she considers doubtful any explanation as due to Christian influence in the 1st or 2nd century the pronunciation of \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 by Hellenistic Jews.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RS7gMJWqX-cC&pg=PA213&dq=Spottorno+%C3%A1mbito+absoluto&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiml47DzIXkAhUFSBUIHTcgCF0Q6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Spottorno%20%C3%A1mbito%20absoluto&f=false M\u00aa V\u00aa Spottorno y D\u00edaz Caro, \"The Divine Name in Ezekiel Papyrus 967\" in Natalio Fern\u00e1ndez Marcos (editor), ''La Septuaginta en la Investigaci\u00f3n Contempor\u00e1nea (V Congreso de la IOSCS)'' (Editorial Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Scient\u00edficas, 1985), pp. 213, 216\u2013217]</ref>\n\nPietersma agrees with Dahl and Segal that, \"while preserved Jewish fragments of the Greek version have some form of transliteration for the tetragrammaton, ''Philo must have read kyrios in his texts''\",{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=93}} and then he adds that: \"there is only one way to negate the force of Philo\u2019s evidence on the equation of kyrios and the tetragram, and that is by making a distinction between what Philo ''saw'' in his Bible and what he ''understood'' and ''read'', but that issue we will turn to at a later point\".

He adds that one of the four, Tov, maintained that the original was neither \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 nor the Hebrew Tetragrammaton, but a pronounceable form such as \u0399\u0391\u03a9, which was later replaced either by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or by the Tetragrammaton in paleo-Hebrew or square Hebrew script.{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=60-61}} In fact, Tov states that \"the writing of the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew characters in Greek revisional texts is a relatively late phenomenon. On the basis of the available evidence, the analysis of the original representation of the Tetragrammaton in Greek Scriptures therefore focuses on the question of whether the first translators wrote either \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or \u0399\u03b1\u03c9\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=p6Nb0o3qY6oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Emanuel+Tov+2008&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL3N2LstPlAhXINcAKHay8AcUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Emanuel%20Tov%202008&f=false Emanuel Tov, ''Hebrew Bible, Greek Bible and Qumran: Collected Essays'' (Mohr Siebeck 2008), chapter 23]</ref><ref>[http://www.emanueltov.info/docs/papers/23.Greek.2008.pdf?v=1.0 Extract of chapter 23, p. 20]</ref> Vasileiadis himself does not accept Pietersma's arguments, which are in direct contradiction of Howard's: he notes that, while Howard proposed that \"several OG/LXX manuscripts dated from the pre-Christian and Christian times preserve the Tetragrammaton where later Christian LXX codices read \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 [...] A. Pietersma proposed the reverse, that the original Alexandrian text of the LXX read \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 while the observed occurrence of the Tetragrammaton in pre-Christian LXX manuscripts represents an archaizing tendency within Palestinian Judaism. Nevertheless, Pietersma's explanation's however repeated may be has not proved convincing.\"{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2018|pp=18-19}} He also, in disagreement with Tov, questions the pre-Christian character of the manuscript with \u0399\u0391\u03a9, proposing instead the \"hypothesis of a Jewish Christian origin for the 4Q120 scroll\".{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2017|pp=51}} He reported others' rejection of Pietersma's arguments and their view that the original Septuagint text had either the Hebrew Tetragrammaton or the word \u0399\u0391\u03a9, without attributing to them support of Howard's hypothesis of the absence of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the pre-Christian text of the Septuagint. Kilpatrick is reported by Robert J.

But since there is no sure proof that kyrios in these works is a substitute for the tetragram, we had better not draw on them. Similarly, we might appeal to Aristeas 155 which contains a near quotation of Deut 7:18, and Aristobulus who seems to make reference to Exod 9:3; but since these authors were transmitted by Christians, kyrios could be secondary.\"{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=93}}\n\nIn what in May 2019 [[Larry W.

Meyer states in relation to Greek biblical manuscripts: \"While \u03b9\u03b1\u03c9 and the Hebrew Tetragrammaton are clearly attested in Greek biblical texts, absent from all [[Second Temple]] copies is the title \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 as a replacement for the Hebrew Tetragrammaton. \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 is the standard title for God in the major Christian codices of the fourth and fifth centuries CE [[Codex Vaticanus|Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus|Sinaiticus]], and [[Codex Alexandrinus|Alexandrinus]] [...] this practice enters the extant record in the second century CE, and from that point on, Christian copies of Greek biblical texts invariably use the term \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 where the underlying Hebrew text reads the Tetragrammaton.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=217\u2013218}} A. R. Meyer's study centers on Greek biblical manuscripts and Jewish-Greek literature from \"Hellenistic and early Roman periods, including Jewish-Hellenistic poets, historians, apologists, Philo, New Testament writings, and many works known today as Pseudepigrapha,\" and additionally in his work it reads that \"the Greek copies of these works date on paleographic grounds much later than the Second Temple period. As such, they do not offer a direct window into Jewish divine name practices from earlier times.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=218}} A. R. Meyer claim: \"overall, the extant Second Temple Greek biblical manuscripts show the avoidance of the divine name in speech, but not in writing, the latter continued well into the first century CE, until Christian scribes largely took over the transmission of Jewish Greek biblical texts and worked to standardize terms for God with \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the nomina sacra, a convention which seems to have been in force since earliest Christian transmission. Yet, it is improbable that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 entered Greek biblical manuscripts only in the first century CE. Apart from the widely held view that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was used in reading Greek biblical texts that show evidence for avoiding the Tetragrammaton, Jewish religious uses of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, as indicated by epigraphic and literary sources that are implausible to explain as the result of later Christian scribal habits\u2014Greek additions to Esther, 2\u20133 Macc, Ach 70 and 71, 4Q126 (?), P. Fouad 203, and others\u2014show that Jews began using \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in writing around the second century BCE.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=279}} Accordingly, he writes that \"the Septuagint manuscripts of the first century CE, which Philo and NT authors rely on for their quotations, could well have contained \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, but this does necessarily require that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 goes back to the Old Greek translation.\";{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=255-256}} and states: \"In summary of the use and non-use of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, the available epigraphic and literary evidence suggests that Jews began using \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in writing approximately during the second and first centuries BCE, but such uses are not uniform or standard. At both ends there are writers for whom \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was not significant: the Jewish-Hellenistic authors of the early second century BCE and Josephus and 4 Macc of the late first century CE. But among these, other writers use \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, including the Greek additions earlier works (Esther, A\u2013F), original Jewish-Greek compositions (2 Macc), and also epigraphic sources (Ach 70 and Ach 71). Further evidence may be adduced from 4Q126, if the reading is accurate, and the apotropaic prayer of P. Fouad 203.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=265}}\n\n=== New Testament treatment of Old Testament quotations ===\nIn 1871, [[Robert Baker Girdlestone]], who later became principal of [[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford]], wrote:\n{{quote|If [the Septuagint] had retained the word [Jehovah], or had even used one Greek word for Jehovah and another for Adonai, such usage would doubtless have been retained in the discourses and arguments of the N.T. Thus our Lord in quoting the 110th Psalm, [...] might have said \"Jehovah said unto Adoni.\"\n\nSupposing a Christian scholar were engaged in translating the Greek Testament into Hebrew, he would have to consider, each time the word \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 occurred, whether there was anything in the context to indicate its true Hebrew representative; and this is the difficulty which would arise in translating the N. T. into all languages if the title Jehovah had been allowed to stand in the O. T. The Hebrew Scriptures would be a guide in many passages: thus, wherever the expression 'the angel of the Lord' occurs, we know that the word Lord represents Jehovah; a similar conclusion as to the expression 'the word of the Lord' would be arrived at, if the precedent set by the O. T. were followed: so also in the case of the title 'the Lord of Hosts.' Wherever, on the contrary, the expression 'My Lord' or 'Our Lord' occurs, we should know that the word Jehovah would be inadmissible, and Adonai or Adoni would have to be used. But many passages would remain for which no rules could be framed.\n\nIt is to be noticed, in connection with this subject, that there are several passages in the O.T. referring to Jehovah which are adopted in the N.T. as fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, in Joel 2.32, we read, 'Whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be saved'; but these words are applied to Jesus Christ in Rom. 10.13. St John (chap. 12.41), after quoting a certain passage from Isaiah, which there refers to Jehovah, affirms that it was a vision of the Glory of Christ (see Isa. 6.9,10). In Isa. 4.3, the preparation of the way of Jehovah is spoken of, but John the Baptist adopts it as referring to the preparation of the way of the Messiah. In Mal. 3.1, there seems to be a very important identification of Jehovah with the Messiah, for we read, 'Jehovah, whom ye (profess to) seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the angel of the covenant whom ye (profess to) delight in.' In Rom. 9.33, and in 1 Pet. 2.6\u22128, Christ is described as 'a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence', titles which appear to be given to Jehovah in Isa. 8.13,14. Again in Isa. 45.23\u221225, Jehovah says, 'Unto me every knee shall bow ... in Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified'. But in Phil. 2.3, we read that God 'hath highly exalted Christ Jesus, and hath given him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is {{LORD}} (surely Jehovah), to the glory of God the Father'.<ref>{{cite book|author=R.

This arises from the theological conviction that it is entirely appropriate to do so since, granted Jesus' identity, what is predicated of God can be predicated no less of him. In other passages, however, God sends the Messiah or the Davidic king, and Jesus himself is that Davidic king, thus establishing a distinction between God and Jesus.

Vasileiadis: \"There is compelling evidence, both explicit and implicit, that some of the Greek Bible copies\u2014like the ones read by Christians such as Irenaeus of Lyons, Origen, Eusebius of Caesarea, Tertullian, Jerome, and Ps-John Chrysostom\u2014were employing the use of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 for the Tetragram. If this conclusion is valid, this would imply that for a few centuries \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 was prevailingly present within the Bible copies read by the dispersed Christian communities, side-by-side with Hebrew Tetragrammata and the increasingly dominant scribal device of ''nomina sacra''. As a result, a possible consequence is that \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 (or, less possibly, a similar Greek term) might well have appeared in the original NT copies\".{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2017|pp=29}}\n\n=== Further observations on the Howard hypothesis ===\n{{Confusing section|date=July 2019}}\nAccording to Didier Fontaine, no specialist has provided a satisfactory (written) solution to the variants reported by Howard. As a background here one might seemingly advance the idea that the Christological controversies are behind these variants \u2013 which seems satisfactory at first, but Shaw points out some latent problems. In an astounding way, great specialists in textual criticism like Metzger and Ehrman do not directly address the thesis of Howard on the variants, which is readily described as \"highly speculative.\" (Osburn). Those who have endorsed Howard's thesis often quote Romans 10.13 as an emblematic case; but Howard has never quoted this verse in his study: one cannot suspect his thesis on this ground. Shaw cites certain scholars who understand this passage, and the quotation of Joel, as referring to the Father.{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=16}}\n\nAlbert Pietersma studied the Pentateuch, proposed an original Kurios in the LXX,{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=87}} and states:\n{{quote|If correct, Howard\u2019s theory could produce interesting results for students of early Christianity, but as will be argued below, the foundation on which it has been built, namely, the ancient LXX, will not sustain it, though it might possibly still be debated whether perhaps the Palestinian copies with which the NT authors were familiar read some form of the tetragram.{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=87}}}}\n\nD. Fontaine claim that \"Indeed, it is particularly important to discredit the original presence of the tetragrammaton in the Septuagint (whatever its form may have been) because it is the starting point of G. Howard's thesis. It is therefore not surprising that from the beginning of the study, Pietersma is attacking Howard.\"{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=3}} D. Fontaine citing ''The Earliest Non-Mystical Jewish Use of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9'' wrote about A. Pietersma that \"[Frank] Shaw reports: \"his arguments are quite often sprinkled with provisos such as 'presumably' (94, 96), 'evidently' (96), 'in our view', 'at times' and 'it would seem' (98). To the critical reader all this hardly inspires any real notion of 'proof'\" (141).{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=7-8}} D. Fontaine also wrote that \"Shaw begins to address the most crucial topics. He thus attacks the thesis of Pietersma (134-149) and shows that it is not sustainable\".{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=7-8}} D. Fontaine also states:\n{{quote|[Frank] Shaw investigates the problem of dictation among NT writers, Paul, for example: did he dictate from the text of the LXX while using a substitute when he read the Name? Would one have sought out the manuscript in order to quote it exactly? (177) Shaw provides no answer: however, is clear from 1QIsaa (-II) this type of pro-cedure is not unknown \u2013 and above all it does not prevent the tetragram from appearing! For example, in Is. 3.17 \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 is put for \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 , and in the same verse, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 is put for \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 . This proves that an amanuensis could very well have heard the qer\u00e9 \"Lord\" and decided that, according to the context, whether he had to write \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 or \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 . In the case of a Christian amanuensis, nothing forbids thinking of an identical process: while hearing the qer\u00e9 \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \"Lord\", the scribe could have decided according to the context to write the tetragram or not. Incidentally, this could account for the variants which Howard highlights\u2026 Furthermore, the hypothesis of a Hebrazing recension would not be an obstacle for this scenario: the Christian authors were quite able to turn to these types of \"more exact\" manuscripts, and we know that they existed at their time (cf. 179).{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11-12}}}}\n\n[[Emanuel Tov]] affirmed: \"in some book of the New Testament and in early Christian literature, Hebraizing revisions of the OG often were quoted rather than the OG version itself, reflecting the beginning of the decline of the LXX (the OG) in Judaism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Emanuel Tov|title=Hebrew Bible, Greek Bible and Qumran: Collected Essays|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2008|isbn=9783161495465|url=https://books.google.com.gt/books?id=p6Nb0o3qY6oC&pg=PA365}}</ref> According to Tuukka Kauhanen, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Faculty of Theology at [[University of Helsinki]], the authors of the New Testament could to know a [[kaige]] type Septuagint text.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Barthelemy: 50 Years After Les Devanciers D'Aquila|publisher=V&r Academic|year=2017|isbn=978-3525540626|author=Tuukka Kauhanen|editor=Anneli Aejmelaeus, Tuukka Kauhanen}}</ref> Some scholars have exposed different views to explain why in citation of [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 12:10 in [[Gospel of John|John]] 19:37 \"with known forms of the text reveals that it demonstrates many similarities with the Hebrew Masoretic text\",<ref name=Bynum>{{cite book|isbn=9789004229143|work=The Fourth Gospel and the Scriptures: Illuminating the Form and Meaning of Scriptural Citation in John 19:37|publisher=BRILL|year=2012|author=Wm.

D. Vasileiadis gives an answer that L. Hurtado calls his \"(final?) reiteration\": \"it is hard to believe that more than 4 centuries of manuscripts extant today would have not included even a trace of the \"Kyrios\" use in the Greek Bible/LXX copies [...] That is, if the rabbinical practice of using (or better, writing) \"Kyrios\" (as rendering of the Tetragrammaton) into the Bible text of the Greek-speaking Judaism was the pre-Christian mainstream practice we should have at least a sample of it. But this is not the case up to today. So, despite the hardly attempt to convince the audience for the rightness of Pietersma's proposal and overturn the \"scholarly consensus\" and \"the prevailing assumption\" \"that the original translators of the LXX never rendered the divine name with Kyrios, but kept the tetragrammaton in Hebrew or Palaeo-Hebrew characters, or that they used the transcription IAO\" (R\u00f6sel 2007:416), I think that Pietersma's proposal is not convincing. The hard (manuscript) evidence does not support this well-built theory. Moreover, it seems that more and more researchers admit that the \"Jewish practice of never pronouncing the name as it is written\" was not as widespread as it has been believed to be until recently. It is probable that despite the fact that the Temple/priestly intelligentsia might refrain or even forbade pronouncing the Tetragrammaton, at least the knowledge of the correct pronunciation of God's name (as was heard at least by the high priest until 70 CE) and respectively its utterance was common practice until at least the 1st century CE. The widespread use of the form IAO is supporting this view.<ref name=\"Hurtado2013\"/>\n\nIn an article that according to D. Fontaine, P. D.

However, as G. Howard argued, this scenario does not satisfactorily explain the subsequent Christological implications of the NT textual variants and the long and bloodstained theological disputes provoked. [...] Pietersma tried to revive the core of Baudissin\u2019s thesis, that is, that \"the LXX had rendered the divine name as kurios right from the beginning\" but \"today, however, Baudissin's view is generally discarded.\" [...] Regarding the sequence in which \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 appeared, M.

Similarly, it was customary at Qumran to use the Tetragram freely when one was either copying or intruducing Scripture quotations into a commentary, but to use ''El'' (\"God\") in original material written for a commentary.\"{{sfn|McRay|2008|pp=129}}<ref>{{cite book|title=CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY: The Evangelism Study Tool|author=Edward D.

Regarding the early text of the Christian Scriptures, Howard supported the thesis that the original texts of the New Testament preserved the Tetragrammaton (either in Hebrew scripts or in a Greek transliteration) in citations and allusions of the OT (Howard, ''\"The Tetragram\"''; idem, ''\"The Name of God\"''; idem, ''\"Tetragrammaton\"''). Shedinger proposed that the Syriac Diatessaron, composed some time after the middle of the second century  C.E.,  may  provide  additional  confirmation  of  Howard\u2019s  hypothesis  (''Tatian  and  the  Jewish  Scriptures'',  136\u2013140).  Additionally,  within the [[Syriac Peshitta#Syriac New Testament|Syriac Peshitta]] is discernible the distinction between \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 rendered as \u0710\u0733\u072a\u071d\u0733\u0721 (marya, which means \"lord\" and refers to the God as signified by the Tetragrammaton; see Lu 1:32) and \u0722\u0730\u072a\u0733\u0721 (maran, a more generic term for \"lord\"; see Joh 21:7).{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=64}}}}\n\nPavlos D. Vasileiadis continues and cites to Muraoka, ''A Greek-Hebrew Aramaic Two-way Index to the Septuagint'' (72), and believes that kurios cannot be a synonym for YHWH: \"Bearing in mind that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the late LXX copies is used to render more than twenty corresponding Hebrew terms or term combinations of the HB, in a similar manner the term \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 does comprise richer information in the Greek NT.\"{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=64}} P. D. Vasileiadis and [[Nehemia Gordon]] in 2019 establish:\n{{quote|On the conceptual level, while some maintain that Jesus and his disciples observed the proscription against speaking the Tetragrammaton, others have concluded that \"it is possible that in oral speech Jesus and the disciples vocalized the divine name.\" Some have gone as far as to suggest that 'Jesus did not know the Jewish fear of pronouncing God's name.\nOn the textual level, the Tetragrammaton has not been found in any surviving Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. Does this mean that the Christian authors opted to use terms like \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 to translate the Tetragrammaton? For the time being we cannot give a definitive answer. As discussed above, it seems improbable that the Tetragrammaton-to-\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 convention\u2014as a kind of Septuagintalism\u2014existed when the New Testament texts were authored. The earliest surviving copies of the New Testament use the nomina sacra, a scribal convention for rendering terms like God and Lord, that expanded rapidly and widely along with the rapid increase of Christian Bible copying. But it becomes obvious from the parallel development of the Old Greek/Septuagint tradition that this practice first appears only in the second century CE and without following a strictly uniform pattern.\nAlthough the support for the use of the Tetragrammaton in Greek New Testament manuscripts is lacking, it is often possible to identify where \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 reflects the Tetragrammaton in contrast to where it reflects Hebrew terms such as adoni used of mortal men and angels. Several scholars have attempted this undertaking..., with the result being an average of 64.4 instances of the Tetragrammaton in the Gospels.{{sfn|Vasileiadis|Gordon|2019|pp=6}}}}\n\nR. Kendal Soulen in a review of Robert J. Wilkinson suggests that:\n{{quote|Contrary to what was commonly supposed as recently as a generation ago, the Tetragrammaton remains comparably important in the New Testament\u2014if anything, it becomes more important still. It occupies a central place in the piety of Jesus... the fact that whereas the Tetragrammaton routinely appears in Jewish biblical texts, in both Hebrew and Greek, it virtually never appears in biblical texts of Christian origin, being represented instead by... the distinctively Christian abbreviation \u039a\u03a3. The implications of \"eclipse\" notwithstanding, however, the author makes the important point that this shift in scribal convention does not signal a lack of Christian interest in the Tetragrammaton.

In this, they are in line with all existing manuscripts of the Greek New Testament.\n\nDifferent translations of the New Testament earlier than the publication of Howard's 1977 hypothesis rendered \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 of the Greek text as \"Jehovah\" or, if the target language was Hebrew, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 or \u05d4\u05e9\u05dd, without proposing that the original word in the New Testament text was not \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 but \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4.<ref name=Pierro/> Matteo Pierro drew up a list of 135 translations of the New Testament, from the 14th century on, that used the Hebrew tetragram itself, \"Jehovah\", \"Yahweh\" or related forms: 26 into Hebrew with \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, twenty in other languages with a translated form throughout, seven with a translated form frequently, while others use a translated form in specified verses.<ref name=Pierro>{{cite book|author=Matteo Pierro|title=Geova e il Nuovo Testamento|trans-title=Jehovah and the New Testament|publisher=Sacchi Editore, Rescaldina (Milano), Italy|year=2000|pp=140\u2013146}}</ref> These 135 translations represent a minute proportion of the existing translations of the New Testament, which by 1 October 2019 has been translated into 2246 different languages, in some of which it exists in dozens of distinct translations.<ref>[https://www.wycliffe.net/resources/scripture-access-statistics/ Scripture Access Statistics (Wycliffe Global Alliance)]</ref>\n\nAs indicated above, capitalization of \"Lord\" in quotations from the Old Testament is a matter of editorial choice and does not necessarily indicate belief that the New Testament texts once displayed some form of the Tetragrammaton instead of \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2. A translator could also for editorial reasons (without thereby expressing a judgment on what was the original New Testament text) present an Old Testament quotation in the form in which the translator envisages it in its Old Testament context, and an explanatory note could also employ a term associated with that other context.\n\n[[File:English NT - CAMPBELL GEORGE DODRIDGE MACKNIGHT 1827 The New Testament Translated from the original Greek JEHOVAH.png|thumb|The New Testament Translated from the original Greek (1827)]]\nHowever, Pierro puts the following as using the word \"Jehovah\", if not in the text of the New Testament, at least in their commentary on it:\n*{{cite book|author=John Eliot|authorlink=John Eliot (missionary)|year=1661|title=The New Testament of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ|editor=Samuel Green and Marmaduke Johnson|location=Cambridge|url=https://archive.org/details/newtestamentofou00elio}}\n*{{cite book|author=Edward Harwood|authorlink=Edward Harwood|year=1768|title=A Liberal Translation of the New Testament|volume=Vol. 11|location=London|publisher=T.

As such, the written name ''kurios'' took on a whole new aura of significance. [...] [Hence arose] a special way of writing the divine name ''kurios'' in Greek. The result was {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}, a contracted form, using the first and last letters of ''kurios''. Interestingly, a transitional stage\u2014between writing YHWH and {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}\u2014can be witnessed in [[Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 656]]. (Though this codex is dated to the second century AD, it probably represents earlier practice.) [...] the original scribe left a four-letter space open [...] for someone else to fill in the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew. But it was not filled in with the Tetragrammaton. Instead, the divine name was squeezed in by another scribe with the name \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2. Evidently, there was no one qualified to fill in the space with the archaic-Hebrew form, so it was filled in with the Greek surrogate.\" He then pictures a situation where the second scribe filled in the empty space not with \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 but with {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}}, and in support quotes [[Harry Y. Gamble]], who, \"following G. Howard, reconstructed a similar scenario for the creation of the nomina sacra\".{{sfn|Comfort|2005|pp=209\u2013210}}\n\nComfort adds: \"Christians (whether Jews or Gentiles) would have first used the nomina sacra in Greek Old Testament texts, and then transferred this practice to New Testament manuscripts. These Old Testament writings could have been books of the Old Testament [...] [or] collections of testimonia\u2014i.e., excerpts of Old Testament passages (with commentary) that Christians compiled as proof texts for Christian claims and that the early Christian writers used for providing quotations in their writings, such as we see in Matthew's Gospel.\" {{sfn|Comfort|2005|pp=210\u2013211}} Howard, on the other hand, supposed that the New Testament writers took their quotations directly from Septuagint manuscripts (which he also supposed to have the Hebrew tetragrammaton), not from the handier testimonia. which might already have nomina sacra.\n\nRecognizing that \"the earliest extant testimony for the nomina sacra does not come from the Testimonia but from continuous Old Testament texts\" of the early second century, Comfort states: \"Regardless of whether the nomina sacra were invented in the testimonia stage or in early Christian Greek Old Testament manuscripts (i.e., first century), the significance is that they may have existed in written form before the Gospels and Epistles were written.

[[George Howard (Hebraist)|George Howard]] published in 1977 a thesis that Robert F. Shedinger calls \"somewhat speculative\", and whose \"revolutionary theological ramifications\" Howard himself drew out. He proposed that the original texts of the New Testament had \"YHWH\" (either in Hebrew characters or in a Greek transliteration) in their quotations from the Old Testament, but not elsewhere, and that it was replaced in the copies made during the second century.{{sfn|Shedinger|2001|pp=138}}\n\nDidier Fontaine observes that Howard's postulate is built on three further suppositions:\n{{quote|[Howard's] thesis boils down to simply this: it is possible that when quoting the OT, the NT authors retained the tetragram in their writings where it figured in the Greek text [i.e., the [[Septuagint]]]. Three observations allow this postulate: 1) the translators of the LXX retained the divine name in Hebrew or paleo-Hebrew in the Greek text\u2014that, at least, is what the manuscripts of the pre-Christian era indicate; 2) it was the Christians, not the Jews, who replaced these instances of the name with \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2; and 3) the textual tradition of the NT contains variants that are explained well in this context.\"{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11}}}}\n\nIn his concluding observations, Howard, recognizing \"the revolutionary nature\" of his thesis that at one time the tetragrammaton was employed in the New Testament, said that, if true, it would require further explanation on various questions:\n\n{{quote|If the Tetragram was used in the NT, how extensively was it used? Was it confined to OT quotations and OT paraphrastic allusions, or was it used in traditional phrases, such as \"the word of God / Lord\" (see the variants in Acts 6:7; 8:25; 12:24; 13:5; 13:44, 48; 14:25; 16:6, 32), \"in the day of the Lord\" (cf. variants in 1 Cor 5:5), \"through the will of God\" (cf. variants in Rom 15:32)? Was it also used in OT-like narratives such as we have in the first two chapters of Luke?{{sfn|Howard|1977|pp=82}}}}\n\nFontaine continues: \"The thesis of Howard has generally aroused negative reactions, like those of [[Carroll D. Osburn|C. Osburn]], [[Donald Juel|D. Juel]] or [[Bruce M. Metzger]]. In the case of Metzger, [Frank] Shaw shows how Howard's thesis has perhaps been distorted and cited in the wrong way.\" Fontaine indicates that dictation, in which what was communicated was the ''spoken'' equivalent of the Tetragrammaton, generally a surrogate (such as ''kurios'', not the Tetragrammaton itself) shows that the text of a Septuagint manuscript or of an original letter of [[Paul the Apostle]] could differ from that in an existing copy of the Septuagint and would thus explain the textual variations adduced in support of Howard's thesis.{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11-12}}\n\nRobert J. Wilkinson rejects Howard's hypothesis: \"It is not possible to assert that all Jewish Greek biblical manuscripts had the Tetragrammaton, nor for that matter that someone reading a Tetragrammaton in a biblical text would necessarily transcribe it into another text as such rather than as, say, ''kurios'' [...}  this conjectured account has Christians initially quoting biblical texts in their own writings to make a clear distinction between Christ and Yhwh and then introducing 'confusion' by deciding to eliminate the Tetragrammaton from their own works. One may ask why they would do that and when.\"{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=94}} He says that Howard's article was influential with regard to certain \"denominational interests\", whom he identifies as those of the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], whose enthusiastic response perhaps somewhat obscured the clarity of the situation (incompatible with those sectarian positions) of \"total absence of the Hebrew Tetragrammaton from all recovered early Christian Greek New Testament manuscripts and their texts\".{{sfn|Wilkinson|2015|pp=92\u201393}}\n\nLarry W. Hurtado remarks: \"Against the contentions of a few (e.g., George Howard), these remarkable developments [\"at a remarkably early point the exalted Jesus was associated with YHWH, such that practices and texts that originally applied to YHWH were 'extended' (so to speak) to include Jesus as the further referent\"] cannot be ascribed to some sort of textual confusion brought on by a supposedly later copyist practice of writing 'Kyrios' in place of YHWH in Greek biblical manuscripts.

While in non-biblical material Jews freely used either the Tetragrammaton or a substitute such as \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, in copying the biblical text itself they carefully guarded the Tetragrammaton, a practice that they extended to translation into Greek but not into Aramaic (p.&nbsp;72); but, Howard said, in the earliest extant copies of the Christian LXX the tetragrammaton is not to be found and is almost universally replaced by \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 (p.&nbsp;74). \"In all probability\", he said, \"the Tetragram in the Christian LXX began to be surrogated with the contracted words {{overline|\u03ba\u03c2}} and {{overline|\u03b8\u03c2}} at least by the beginning of the second century\" (pp.&nbsp;74\u221275). \"Towards the end of the first century\", he said, \"Gentile Christians [...] substituted the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 [...] for the Tetragram\" (pp.&nbsp;76\u221277). Howard's theory was that, in the interval between the writing of the texts that were later compiled to form the New Testament and the adoption of these surrogates, quotations in those texts would have the Tetragrammaton: \"It is reasonable to believe that the NT writers, when quoting from Scripture, preserved the Tetragram within the biblical text. On the analogy of pre-Christian Jewish practice we can imagine that the NT text incorporated the Tetragram into its OT quotations and that the words \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2 were used when secondary references to God were made in the comments that were based upon the quotations. The Tetragram in these quotations would, of course, have remained as long as it continued to be used in the Christian copies of the LXX. But when it was removed from the Greek OT, it was also removed from the quotations of the OT in the NT. Thus somewhere around the beginning of the second century the use of surrogates must have crowded out the Tetragram in both Testaments\" (p.&nbsp;77).{{sfn|Howard|1977|pp=77}}\n\nIn the following year 1978, Howard wrote in the popular-style [[Biblical Archaeology Review]]: \"I offer the following scenario of the history of the Tetragrammaton in the Greek Bible as a whole, including both testaments. First, as to the Old Testament- Jewish scribes always preserved the Tetragrammaton in their copies of the Septuagint both before and after the New Testament period. In all probability Jewish Christians wrote the Tetragrammaton in Hebrew as well. Toward the end of the first Christian century, when the church had become predominantly Gentile, the motive for retaining the Hebrew name for God was lost and the words kyrios and theos were substituted for it in Christian copies of Old Testament Septuagints. Both kyrios and theos were written in abbreviated form in a conscious effort to preserve the sacred nature of the divine name. Soon the original significance of the contractions was lost and many other contracted words were added. A similar pattern probably evolved with respect to the New Testament. ''When the Septuagint which the New Testament church used and quoted contained the Hebrew form of the divine name, the New Testament writers no doubt included the Tetragrammaton in their quotations.'' But when the Hebrew form for the divine name was eliminated in favor of Greek substitutes in the Septuagint, it was eliminated also from the New Testament quotations of the Septuagint.\"<ref>{{cite journal|author=George Howard|title=The Name of God in the New Testament.

But some have proposed that the earliest practice was fairly consistently to translate YHWH with \"Kyrios\" (\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2), others that the Hebrew divine name was initially rendered phonetically as \u0399\u0391\u03a9 (\"Iao\"), and others that the divine name was originally retained in Hebrew characters.

On the basis of the available evidence, the analysis of the original representation of the Tetragrammaton in Greek Scriptures therefore focuses on the question of whether the first translators wrote either \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or \u0399\u03b1\u03c9\".<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=p6Nb0o3qY6oC&printsec=frontcover&dq=Emanuel+Tov+2008&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL3N2LstPlAhXINcAKHay8AcUQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&q=Emanuel%20Tov%202008&f=false Emanuel Tov, ''Hebrew Bible, Greek Bible and Qumran: Collected Essays'' (Mohr Siebeck 2008), chapter 23]</ref><ref>[http://www.emanueltov.info/docs/papers/23.Greek.2008.pdf?v=1.0 Extract of chapter 23, p. 20]</ref> Vasileiadis himself does not accept Pietersma's arguments, which are in direct contradiction of Howard's: he notes that, while Howard proposed that \"several OG/LXX manuscripts dated from the pre-Christian and Christian times preserve the Tetragrammaton where later Christian LXX codices read \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 [...] A. Pietersma proposed the reverse, that the original Alexandrian text of the LXX read \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 while the observed occurrence of the Tetragrammaton in pre-Christian LXX manuscripts represents an archaizing tendency within Palestinian Judaism. Nevertheless, Pietersma's explanation's however repeated may be has not proved convincing.\"{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2018|pp=18-19}} He also, in disagreement with Tov, questions the pre-Christian character of the manuscript with \u0399\u0391\u03a9, proposing instead the \"hypothesis of a Jewish Christian origin for the 4Q120 scroll\".{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2017|pp=51}} He reported others' rejection of Pietersma's arguments and their view that the original Septuagint text had either the Hebrew Tetragrammaton or the word \u0399\u0391\u03a9, without attributing to them support of Howard's hypothesis of the absence of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the pre-Christian text of the Septuagint. Kilpatrick is reported by Robert J.

But since there is no sure proof that kyrios in these works is a substitute for the tetragram, we had better not draw on them. Similarly, we might appeal to Aristeas 155 which contains a near quotation of Deut 7:18, and Aristobulus who seems to make reference to Exod 9:3; but since these authors were transmitted by Christians, kyrios could be secondary.\"{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=93}}\n\nIn what in May 2019 [[Larry W.

Meyer states in relation to Greek biblical manuscripts: \"While \u03b9\u03b1\u03c9 and the Hebrew Tetragrammaton are clearly attested in Greek biblical texts, absent from all [[Second Temple]] copies is the title \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 as a replacement for the Hebrew Tetragrammaton. \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 is the standard title for God in the major Christian codices of the fourth and fifth centuries CE [[Codex Vaticanus|Vaticanus]], [[Codex Sinaiticus|Sinaiticus]], and [[Codex Alexandrinus|Alexandrinus]] [...] this practice enters the extant record in the second century CE, and from that point on, Christian copies of Greek biblical texts invariably use the term \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 where the underlying Hebrew text reads the Tetragrammaton.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=217\u2013218}} A. R. Meyer's study centers on Greek biblical manuscripts and Jewish-Greek literature from \"Hellenistic and early Roman periods, including Jewish-Hellenistic poets, historians, apologists, Philo, New Testament writings, and many works known today as Pseudepigrapha,\" and additionally in his work it reads that \"the Greek copies of these works date on paleographic grounds much later than the Second Temple period. As such, they do not offer a direct window into Jewish divine name practices from earlier times.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=218}} A. R. Meyer claim: \"overall, the extant Second Temple Greek biblical manuscripts show the avoidance of the divine name in speech, but not in writing, the latter continued well into the first century CE, until Christian scribes largely took over the transmission of Jewish Greek biblical texts and worked to standardize terms for God with \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the nomina sacra, a convention which seems to have been in force since earliest Christian transmission. Yet, it is improbable that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 entered Greek biblical manuscripts only in the first century CE. Apart from the widely held view that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was used in reading Greek biblical texts that show evidence for avoiding the Tetragrammaton, Jewish religious uses of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, as indicated by epigraphic and literary sources that are implausible to explain as the result of later Christian scribal habits\u2014Greek additions to Esther, 2\u20133 Macc, Ach 70 and 71, 4Q126 (?), P. Fouad 203, and others\u2014show that Jews began using \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in writing around the second century BCE.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=279}} Accordingly, he writes that \"the Septuagint manuscripts of the first century CE, which Philo and NT authors rely on for their quotations, could well have contained \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, but this does necessarily require that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 goes back to the Old Greek translation.\";{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=255-256}} and states: \"In summary of the use and non-use of \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, the available epigraphic and literary evidence suggests that Jews began using \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in writing approximately during the second and first centuries BCE, but such uses are not uniform or standard. At both ends there are writers for whom \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 was not significant: the Jewish-Hellenistic authors of the early second century BCE and Josephus and 4 Macc of the late first century CE. But among these, other writers use \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, including the Greek additions earlier works (Esther, A\u2013F), original Jewish-Greek compositions (2 Macc), and also epigraphic sources (Ach 70 and Ach 71). Further evidence may be adduced from 4Q126, if the reading is accurate, and the apotropaic prayer of P. Fouad 203.\"{{sfn|Meyer|2017|pp=265}}\n\n=== New Testament treatment of Old Testament quotations ===\nIn 1871, [[Robert Baker Girdlestone]], who later became principal of [[Wycliffe Hall, Oxford]], wrote:\n{{quote|If [the Septuagint] had retained the word [Jehovah], or had even used one Greek word for Jehovah and another for Adonai, such usage would doubtless have been retained in the discourses and arguments of the N.T. Thus our Lord in quoting the 110th Psalm, [...] might have said \"Jehovah said unto Adoni.\"\n\nSupposing a Christian scholar were engaged in translating the Greek Testament into Hebrew, he would have to consider, each time the word \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 occurred, whether there was anything in the context to indicate its true Hebrew representative; and this is the difficulty which would arise in translating the N. T. into all languages if the title Jehovah had been allowed to stand in the O. T. The Hebrew Scriptures would be a guide in many passages: thus, wherever the expression 'the angel of the Lord' occurs, we know that the word Lord represents Jehovah; a similar conclusion as to the expression 'the word of the Lord' would be arrived at, if the precedent set by the O. T. were followed: so also in the case of the title 'the Lord of Hosts.' Wherever, on the contrary, the expression 'My Lord' or 'Our Lord' occurs, we should know that the word Jehovah would be inadmissible, and Adonai or Adoni would have to be used. But many passages would remain for which no rules could be framed.\n\nIt is to be noticed, in connection with this subject, that there are several passages in the O.T. referring to Jehovah which are adopted in the N.T. as fulfilled in the Lord Jesus Christ. Thus, in Joel 2.32, we read, 'Whosoever shall call on the name of Jehovah shall be saved'; but these words are applied to Jesus Christ in Rom. 10.13. St John (chap. 12.41), after quoting a certain passage from Isaiah, which there refers to Jehovah, affirms that it was a vision of the Glory of Christ (see Isa. 6.9,10). In Isa. 4.3, the preparation of the way of Jehovah is spoken of, but John the Baptist adopts it as referring to the preparation of the way of the Messiah. In Mal. 3.1, there seems to be a very important identification of Jehovah with the Messiah, for we read, 'Jehovah, whom ye (profess to) seek, shall suddenly come to his temple, even the angel of the covenant whom ye (profess to) delight in.' In Rom. 9.33, and in 1 Pet. 2.6\u22128, Christ is described as 'a stone of stumbling and a rock of offence', titles which appear to be given to Jehovah in Isa. 8.13,14. Again in Isa. 45.23\u221225, Jehovah says, 'Unto me every knee shall bow ... in Jehovah shall all the seed of Israel be justified'. But in Phil. 2.3, we read that God 'hath highly exalted Christ Jesus, and hath given him the name which is above every name, that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is {{LORD}} (surely Jehovah), to the glory of God the Father'.<ref>{{cite book|author=R.

This arises from the theological conviction that it is entirely appropriate to do so since, granted Jesus' identity, what is predicated of God can be predicated no less of him. In other passages, however, God sends the Messiah or the Davidic king, and Jesus himself is that Davidic king, thus establishing a distinction between God and Jesus.

Vasileiadis: \"There is compelling evidence, both explicit and implicit, that some of the Greek Bible copies\u2014like the ones read by Christians such as Irenaeus of Lyons, Origen, Eusebius of Caesarea, Tertullian, Jerome, and Ps-John Chrysostom\u2014were employing the use of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 for the Tetragram. If this conclusion is valid, this would imply that for a few centuries \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 was prevailingly present within the Bible copies read by the dispersed Christian communities, side-by-side with Hebrew Tetragrammata and the increasingly dominant scribal device of ''nomina sacra''. As a result, a possible consequence is that \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 (or, less possibly, a similar Greek term) might well have appeared in the original NT copies\".{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2017|pp=29}}\n\n=== Further observations on the Howard hypothesis ===\n{{Confusing section|date=July 2019}}\nAccording to Didier Fontaine, no specialist has provided a satisfactory (written) solution to the variants reported by Howard. As a background here one might seemingly advance the idea that the Christological controversies are behind these variants \u2013 which seems satisfactory at first, but Shaw points out some latent problems. In an astounding way, great specialists in textual criticism like Metzger and Ehrman do not directly address the thesis of Howard on the variants, which is readily described as \"highly speculative.\" (Osburn). Those who have endorsed Howard's thesis often quote Romans 10.13 as an emblematic case; but Howard has never quoted this verse in his study: one cannot suspect his thesis on this ground. Shaw cites certain scholars who understand this passage, and the quotation of Joel, as referring to the Father.{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=16}}\n\nAlbert Pietersma studied the Pentateuch, proposed an original Kurios in the LXX,{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=87}} and states:\n{{quote|If correct, Howard\u2019s theory could produce interesting results for students of early Christianity, but as will be argued below, the foundation on which it has been built, namely, the ancient LXX, will not sustain it, though it might possibly still be debated whether perhaps the Palestinian copies with which the NT authors were familiar read some form of the tetragram.{{sfn|Pietersma|Cox|Wevers|1984|pp=87}}}}\n\nD. Fontaine claim that \"Indeed, it is particularly important to discredit the original presence of the tetragrammaton in the Septuagint (whatever its form may have been) because it is the starting point of G. Howard's thesis. It is therefore not surprising that from the beginning of the study, Pietersma is attacking Howard.\"{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=3}} D. Fontaine citing ''The Earliest Non-Mystical Jewish Use of \u0399\u03b1\u03c9'' wrote about A. Pietersma that \"[Frank] Shaw reports: \"his arguments are quite often sprinkled with provisos such as 'presumably' (94, 96), 'evidently' (96), 'in our view', 'at times' and 'it would seem' (98). To the critical reader all this hardly inspires any real notion of 'proof'\" (141).{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=7-8}} D. Fontaine also wrote that \"Shaw begins to address the most crucial topics. He thus attacks the thesis of Pietersma (134-149) and shows that it is not sustainable\".{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=7-8}} D. Fontaine also states:\n{{quote|[Frank] Shaw investigates the problem of dictation among NT writers, Paul, for example: did he dictate from the text of the LXX while using a substitute when he read the Name? Would one have sought out the manuscript in order to quote it exactly? (177) Shaw provides no answer: however, is clear from 1QIsaa (-II) this type of pro-cedure is not unknown \u2013 and above all it does not prevent the tetragram from appearing! For example, in Is. 3.17 \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 is put for \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 , and in the same verse, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 is put for \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 . This proves that an amanuensis could very well have heard the qer\u00e9 \"Lord\" and decided that, according to the context, whether he had to write \u05d0\u05d3\u05e0\u05d9 or \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 . In the case of a Christian amanuensis, nothing forbids thinking of an identical process: while hearing the qer\u00e9 \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2, \"Lord\", the scribe could have decided according to the context to write the tetragram or not. Incidentally, this could account for the variants which Howard highlights\u2026 Furthermore, the hypothesis of a Hebrazing recension would not be an obstacle for this scenario: the Christian authors were quite able to turn to these types of \"more exact\" manuscripts, and we know that they existed at their time (cf. 179).{{sfn|Fontaine|2014|pp=11-12}}}}\n\n[[Emanuel Tov]] affirmed: \"in some book of the New Testament and in early Christian literature, Hebraizing revisions of the OG often were quoted rather than the OG version itself, reflecting the beginning of the decline of the LXX (the OG) in Judaism.<ref>{{cite book|author=Emanuel Tov|title=Hebrew Bible, Greek Bible and Qumran: Collected Essays|publisher=Mohr Siebeck|year=2008|isbn=9783161495465|url=https://books.google.com.gt/books?id=p6Nb0o3qY6oC&pg=PA365}}</ref> According to Tuukka Kauhanen, a Postdoctoral Researcher at the Faculty of Theology at [[University of Helsinki]], the authors of the New Testament could to know a [[kaige]] type Septuagint text.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Legacy of Barthelemy: 50 Years After Les Devanciers D'Aquila|publisher=V&r Academic|year=2017|isbn=978-3525540626|author=Tuukka Kauhanen|editor=Anneli Aejmelaeus, Tuukka Kauhanen}}</ref> Some scholars have exposed different views to explain why in citation of [[Book of Zechariah|Zechariah]] 12:10 in [[Gospel of John|John]] 19:37 \"with known forms of the text reveals that it demonstrates many similarities with the Hebrew Masoretic text\",<ref name=Bynum>{{cite book|isbn=9789004229143|work=The Fourth Gospel and the Scriptures: Illuminating the Form and Meaning of Scriptural Citation in John 19:37|publisher=BRILL|year=2012|author=Wm.

D. Vasileiadis gives an answer that L. Hurtado calls his \"(final?) reiteration\": \"it is hard to believe that more than 4 centuries of manuscripts extant today would have not included even a trace of the \"Kyrios\" use in the Greek Bible/LXX copies [...] That is, if the rabbinical practice of using (or better, writing) \"Kyrios\" (as rendering of the Tetragrammaton) into the Bible text of the Greek-speaking Judaism was the pre-Christian mainstream practice we should have at least a sample of it. But this is not the case up to today. So, despite the hardly attempt to convince the audience for the rightness of Pietersma's proposal and overturn the \"scholarly consensus\" and \"the prevailing assumption\" \"that the original translators of the LXX never rendered the divine name with Kyrios, but kept the tetragrammaton in Hebrew or Palaeo-Hebrew characters, or that they used the transcription IAO\" (R\u00f6sel 2007:416), I think that Pietersma's proposal is not convincing. The hard (manuscript) evidence does not support this well-built theory. Moreover, it seems that more and more researchers admit that the \"Jewish practice of never pronouncing the name as it is written\" was not as widespread as it has been believed to be until recently. It is probable that despite the fact that the Temple/priestly intelligentsia might refrain or even forbade pronouncing the Tetragrammaton, at least the knowledge of the correct pronunciation of God's name (as was heard at least by the high priest until 70 CE) and respectively its utterance was common practice until at least the 1st century CE. The widespread use of the form IAO is supporting this view.<ref name=\"Hurtado2013\"/>\n\nIn an article that according to D. Fontaine, P. D.

However, as G. Howard argued, this scenario does not satisfactorily explain the subsequent Christological implications of the NT textual variants and the long and bloodstained theological disputes provoked. [...] Pietersma tried to revive the core of Baudissin\u2019s thesis, that is, that \"the LXX had rendered the divine name as kurios right from the beginning\" but \"today, however, Baudissin's view is generally discarded.\" [...] Regarding the sequence in which \u0399\u03b1\u03c9 appeared, M.

Similarly, it was customary at Qumran to use the Tetragram freely when one was either copying or intruducing Scripture quotations into a commentary, but to use ''El'' (\"God\") in original material written for a commentary.\"{{sfn|McRay|2008|pp=129}}<ref>{{cite book|title=CHRISTIAN THEOLOGY: The Evangelism Study Tool|author=Edward D.

Regarding the early text of the Christian Scriptures, Howard supported the thesis that the original texts of the New Testament preserved the Tetragrammaton (either in Hebrew scripts or in a Greek transliteration) in citations and allusions of the OT (Howard, ''\"The Tetragram\"''; idem, ''\"The Name of God\"''; idem, ''\"Tetragrammaton\"''). Shedinger proposed that the Syriac Diatessaron, composed some time after the middle of the second century  C.E.,  may  provide  additional  confirmation  of  Howard\u2019s  hypothesis  (''Tatian  and  the  Jewish  Scriptures'',  136\u2013140).  Additionally,  within the [[Syriac Peshitta#Syriac New Testament|Syriac Peshitta]] is discernible the distinction between \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 rendered as \u0710\u0733\u072a\u071d\u0733\u0721 (marya, which means \"lord\" and refers to the God as signified by the Tetragrammaton; see Lu 1:32) and \u0722\u0730\u072a\u0733\u0721 (maran, a more generic term for \"lord\"; see Joh 21:7).{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=64}}}}\n\nPavlos D. Vasileiadis continues and cites to Muraoka, ''A Greek-Hebrew Aramaic Two-way Index to the Septuagint'' (72), and believes that kurios cannot be a synonym for YHWH: \"Bearing in mind that \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 in the late LXX copies is used to render more than twenty corresponding Hebrew terms or term combinations of the HB, in a similar manner the term \u03ba\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 does comprise richer information in the Greek NT.\"{{sfn|Vasileiadis|2014|pp=64}} P. D. Vasileiadis and [[Nehemia Gordon]] in 2019 establish:\n{{quote|On the conceptual level, while some maintain that Jesus and his disciples observed the proscription against speaking the Tetragrammaton, others have concluded that \"it is possible that in oral speech Jesus and the disciples vocalized the divine name.\" Some have gone as far as to suggest that 'Jesus did not know the Jewish fear of pronouncing God's name.\nOn the textual level, the Tetragrammaton has not been found in any surviving Greek manuscripts of the New Testament. Does this mean that the Christian authors opted to use terms like \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03c2 and \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 to translate the Tetragrammaton? For the time being we cannot give a definitive answer. As discussed above, it seems improbable that the Tetragrammaton-to-\u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 convention\u2014as a kind of Septuagintalism\u2014existed when the New Testament texts were authored. The earliest surviving copies of the New Testament use the nomina sacra, a scribal convention for rendering terms like God and Lord, that expanded rapidly and widely along with the rapid increase of Christian Bible copying. But it becomes obvious from the parallel development of the Old Greek/Septuagint tradition that this practice first appears only in the second century CE and without following a strictly uniform pattern.\nAlthough the support for the use of the Tetragrammaton in Greek New Testament manuscripts is lacking, it is often possible to identify where \u03ba\u03c5\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 reflects the Tetragrammaton in contrast to where it reflects Hebrew terms such as adoni used of mortal men and angels. Several scholars have attempted this undertaking..., with the result being an average of 64.4 instances of the Tetragrammaton in the Gospels.{{sfn|Vasileiadis|Gordon|2019|pp=6}}}}\n\nR. Kendal Soulen in a review of Robert J. Wilkinson suggests that:\n{{quote|Contrary to what was commonly supposed as recently as a generation ago, the Tetragrammaton remains comparably important in the New Testament\u2014if anything, it becomes more important still. It occupies a central place in the piety of Jesus... the fact that whereas the Tetragrammaton routinely appears in Jewish biblical texts, in both Hebrew and Greek, it virtually never appears in biblical texts of Christian origin, being represented instead by... the distinctively Christian abbreviation \u039a\u03a3. The implications of \"eclipse\" notwithstanding, however, the author makes the important point that this shift in scribal convention does not signal a lack of Christian interest in the Tetragrammaton.

In this, they are in line with all existing manuscripts of the Greek New Testament.\n\nDifferent translations of the New Testament earlier than the publication of Howard's 1977 hypothesis rendered \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 of the Greek text as \"Jehovah\" or, if the target language was Hebrew, \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4 or \u05d4\u05e9\u05dd, without proposing that the original word in the New Testament text was not \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 but \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4.<ref name=Pierro/> Matteo Pierro drew up a list of 135 translations of the New Testament, from the 14th century on, that used the Hebrew tetragram itself, \"Jehovah\", \"Yahweh\" or related forms: 26 into Hebrew with \u05d9\u05d4\u05d5\u05d4, twenty in other languages with a translated form throughout, seven with a translated form frequently, while others use a translated form in specified verses.<ref name=Pierro>{{cite book|author=Matteo Pierro|title=Geova e il Nuovo Testamento|trans-title=Jehovah and the New Testament|publisher=Sacchi Editore, Rescaldina (Milano), Italy|year=2000|pp=140\u2013146}}</ref> These 135 translations represent a minute proportion of the existing translations of the New Testament, which by 1 October 2019 has been translated into 2246 different languages, in some of which it exists in dozens of distinct translations.<ref>[https://www.wycliffe.net/resources/scripture-access-statistics/ Scripture Access Statistics (Wycliffe Global Alliance)]</ref>\n\nAs indicated above, capitalization of \"Lord\" in quotations from the Old Testament is a matter of editorial choice and does not necessarily indicate belief that the New Testament texts once displayed some form of the Tetragrammaton instead of \u039a\u03cd\u03c1\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 or \u0398\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2. A translator could also for editorial reasons (without thereby expressing a judgment on what was the original New Testament text) present an Old Testament quotation in the form in which the translator envisages it in its Old Testament context, and an explanatory note could also employ a term associated with that other context.\n\n[[File:English NT - CAMPBELL GEORGE DODRIDGE MACKNIGHT 1827 The New Testament Translated from the original Greek JEHOVAH.png|thumb|The New Testament Translated from the original Greek (1827)]]\nHowever, Pierro puts the following as using the word \"Jehovah\", if not in the text of the New Testament, at least in their commentary on it:\n*{{cite book|author=John Eliot|authorlink=John Eliot (missionary)|year=1661|title=The New Testament of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ|editor=Samuel Green and Marmaduke Johnson|location=Cambridge|url=https://archive.org/details/newtestamentofou00elio}}\n*{{cite book|author=Edward Harwood|authorlink=Edward Harwood|year=1768|title=A Liberal Translation of the New Testament|volume=Vol. 11|location=London|publisher=T.

Despite his father's refusal, Prakash takes Murthy into his house. But Prakash's parents do not like their son making friendship with Murthy who is poor and they consider it to be a status issue.\n\nA few years later, when Prakash goes to the US to study. Meanwhile, Prakash's parents scold Murthy with a plan to make him leave their house. Murthy feels bad and decides to leave Prakash's house without informing anyone. An old police constable accommodates Murthy who treats him like his late son Govind and the man begins to call him by that name. Murthy also comes under the identity of Govind now and starts working in an apartment by helping the residents of that apartment. Murthy has a percussion instrument and plays his favourite tune always. Murthy meets Kasturi ([[Devayani (actress)|Devayani]]) a [[Visual impairment|blind]] flower seller and falls in love with her. Kasturi also likes Murthy's character after he saved her from a few thugs who tried to molest her. Kasturi's father ([[Delhi Ganesh]]) is a drunkard and dies in an accident which leaves Kasturi alone with an [[eye injury]] which made her blind. Murthy takes care of Kasturi now and takes her to a doctor (Srividya) with an aim of getting her vision. The doctor advises Kasturi to undergo a surgery following which there are chances for getting her vision. In order to pay for the operation, Murthy takes some money from a drunk man's house. In a misunderstanding, he gets arrested by the police and is sent to jail.\n\nKasturi gets her vision after surgery but she is worried as Murthy has never returned. The doctor takes Kasturi to her home and asks her to stay until Murthy comes back. In the meantime, Prakash returns to India after completing his studies and he falls in love with Kasturi at first sight. Prakash convinces his parents to arrange his wedding with Kasturi. Although Kasturi is not interested in this proposal, she is convinced by the doctor as there is no point in worrying about Murthy who has disappeared for a while.\n\nKasturi, who cannot find Murthy, agrees to wed Prakash although she is not interested. Murthy is released by the police as he is proved innocent. One day, Prakash finds Murthy and is shocked to see his condition. Prakash takes Murthy along with him to his home. At Prakash's home, Murthy is shocked knowing that he is in love with Kasturi who has got her eyesight now. Murthy decides to hide his identity to Kasturi (as she knows him only by the name Govind and she has not seen him before). Murthy does not even speak in front of Kasturi as she will be able to identify his voice. Murthy also convinces the doctor to not reveal about him to Kasturi as he wanted his close friend Prakash to lead a happy life marrying Kasturi.\n\nOn the day of the wedding, a poor boy comes to the marriage hall looking for food. He plays Murthy's tune with the percussion instrument which shocks Kasturi. She rushes to the boy and enquires about Govind. The boy points out Murthy as the one who taught him to play this tune while he was begging before. Now Kasturi understands that Prakash's friend Murthy is none other than Govind whom she was searching.\n\nKasturi runs towards Murthy and requests him to marry her. Murthy is shocked and speechless. Prakash's parents speak ill about Murthy and Kasturi. Prakash comes to the spot and asks the truth to Murthy. Murthy tries to manage the situation and finally, when Prakash asks him to make a promise on him, Murthy does not do fearing any harm to Prakash. Murthy reveals the truth and wants Prakash to lead a joyful life which made him sacrifice his love.\n\nPrakash on hearing this is overwhelmed by the love of his friend and immediately asks him to marry Kasturi.
