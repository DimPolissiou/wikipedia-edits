Crusade}}\n{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}\n}}\nThe '''Second Crusade''' (1147\u20131150) was the second major [[crusade]] launched from Europe. The Second Crusade was started in response to the [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|fall]] of the [[County of Edessa]] in 1144 to the forces of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]]. The county had been founded during the [[First Crusade]] (1096\u20131099) by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] in 1098. While it was the first [[Crusader state]] to be founded, it was also the first to fall.\n\nThe Second Crusade was announced by [[Pope Eugene III]], and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Conrad III of Germany]], with help from a number of other European nobles. The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe. After crossing [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory into [[Anatolia]], both armies were separately defeated by the [[Seljuk Turks]]. The main Western Christian source, [[Odo of Deuil]], and [[Syriac Christian]] sources claim that the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] secretly hindered the crusaders' progress, particularly in Anatolia, where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached [[Jerusalem]] and participated in 1148 in an ill-advised attack on [[Damascus]]. The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the [[Muslims]]. It would ultimately have a key influence on the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] and give rise to the [[Third Crusade]] at the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe only significant Christian success of the Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the [[Holy Land]], the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the [[Siege of Lisbon|capture of Lisbon]], expelling its [[Moorish]] occupants.\n\n== Background: the fall of Edessa ==\n{{main|Siege of Edessa (1144)}}\nAfter the [[First Crusade]] and the minor [[Crusade of 1101]], there were three [[crusader state]]s established in the east: the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the [[Principality of Antioch]] and the [[County of Edessa]]. A fourth, the [[County of Tripoli]], was established in 1109. Edessa was the most northerly of these, and also the weakest and least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the [[Ortoqids]], [[Danishmends]] and [[Seljuq Turks]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=50\u201353}} Count [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] and future count [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]] were taken captive after their defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]] in 1104. Baldwin and Joscelin were both captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the [[Battle of Azaz (1125)|Battle of Azaz]] in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II]] was forced into an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but in 1143 both the [[list of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[John II Comnenus]] and the [[King of Jerusalem]] [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk of Anjou]] died. Joscelin had also quarreled with the Count of Tripoli and the Prince of Antioch, leaving Edessa with no powerful allies.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Seljuq [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]], had added to his rule in 1128 [[Aleppo]], the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and [[Damascus]]. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their attention towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}} Damascus, ruled by the [[Burid Dynasty]], later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140;{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=227\u2013228}} the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler [[Usamah ibn Munqidh]].<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5440995n.image.r=Ous%C3%A2ma+ibn+Mounkidh.f203.langEN Ous\u00e2ma ibn Mounkidh, un \u00e9mir syrien au premier si\u00e8cle des croisades, p.182 (in BnF)]</ref>\n\nIn late 1144, Joscelin II allied with the Ortoqids and marched out of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] with almost his entire army to support the Ortoqid army against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|besiege Edessa]], which fell to him after a month on 24 December 1144. [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]] and others were sent from Jerusalem to assist, but arrived too late. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county from [[Turbessel]], but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by Muslims or sold to the Byzantines. Zengi himself was praised throughout Islam as \"defender of the faith\" and ''al-Malik al-Mansur'', \"the victorious king\". He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Events in Mosul compelled him to return home, and he once again set his sights on Damascus. However, he was [[Assassination|assassinated]] by a slave in 1146 and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=225\u2013244}}\n\n=== ''Quantum praedecessores'' ===\n{{main|Quantum praedecessores}}\nThe news of the fall of Edessa was brought back to Europe first by pilgrims early in 1145, and then by embassies from Antioch, Jerusalem and Armenia. Bishop [[Hugh of Jabala]] reported the news to [[Pope Eugene III]], who issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Quantum praedecessores]]'' on 1 December of that year, calling for a second crusade.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=273\u2013275}} Hugh also told the Pope of an eastern Christian king, who, it was hoped, would bring relief to the crusader states: this is the first documented mention of [[Prester John]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=247}} Eugene did not control Rome and lived instead at [[Viterbo]],{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=289}} but nevertheless the Second Crusade was meant to be more organized and centrally controlled than the First: the armies would be led by the strongest kings of Europe and a route would be planned beforehand.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=298}}\n\nThe initial response to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued when it was clear that [[Louis VII of France]] would be taking part in the expedition. Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It is debatable whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about ''Quantum Praedecessores''. In any case, [[Abbot Suger]] and other nobles were not in favour of Louis's plans, as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who referred him back to Eugene. By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis's crusade. The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146, and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\n== Saint Bernard of Clairvaux ==\n[[File:Stained glass St Bernard MNMA Cl3273.jpg|150px|thumb|left|St Bernard in stained glass, from the Upper Rhine, c. 1450|alt=Stained glass image of a kneeling man with a halo holding an open book and a staff]]\nThe Pope commissioned French abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] to preach the Second Crusade, and granted the same [[indulgence]]s for it which [[Pope Urban II]] had accorded to the [[First Crusade]].{{sfn|Bunson|1998|p=130}} A [[Council of V\u00e9zelay (1146)|parliament]] was convoked at [[Vezelay]] in Burgundy in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly on 31 March. [[Louis VII of France]], his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], and the princes and lords present prostrated themselves at the feet of Bernard to receive the pilgrims' cross. Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. At Speyer, [[Conrad III of Germany]] and his nephew, later Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], received the cross from the hand of Bernard.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} Pope Eugene came in person to France to encourage the enterprise.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\nFor all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was by nature neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching inadvertently led to attacks on [[Jews]]; a fanatical French monk named [[Radulphe|Rudolf]] was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the [[Rhineland]], [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Speyer]], with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. Bernard, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problem and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=281\u2013288}}\n\n== Wendish Crusade ==\n{{Main|Wendish Crusade}}\nWhen the Second Crusade was called, many [[Southern Germany|south Germans]] volunteered to crusade in the [[Holy Land]]. The [[Northern Germany|north German]] Saxons were reluctant. They told St Bernard of their desire to campaign against pagan Slavs at an [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] meeting in [[Frankfurt]] on 13 March 1147. Approving of the Saxons' plan, Eugenius issued a [[papal bull]] known as the ''Divina dispensatione'' on 13 April. This bull stated that there was to be no difference between the spiritual rewards of the different crusaders. Those who volunteered to crusade against the pagan Slavs were primarily [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Saxons]] and [[Poles]],{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=362}} although there were also some [[Bohemia]]ns.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=326}} The [[Papal legate]], [[Anselm of Havelberg]], was placed in overall command. The campaign itself was led by Saxon families such as the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] and [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Schauenburgers]].{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=328}}\n\nUpset by German participation in the crusade, the [[Obotrites]] preemptively invaded [[Wagria]] in [[Holstein]] in June 1147, leading to the march of the crusaders in late summer 1147. After expelling the Obodrites from Christian territory, the crusaders targeted the Obodrite fort at [[Dobin am See|Dobin]] and the [[Liutizian]] fort at [[Demmin]]. The forces attacking Dobin included those of the Danes [[Canute V of Denmark|Canute V]] and [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn III]], Adalbert II, [[Archbishop of Bremen]] and Duke [[Henry the Lion]] of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. When some crusaders advocated ravaging the countryside, others objected by asking, \"Is not the land we are devastating our land, and the people we are fighting our people?\"{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=55}} The Saxon army under Henry the Lion withdrew after the pagan chief, [[Niklot]], agreed to have Dobin's garrison undergo [[baptism]].\n\nAfter an unsuccessful siege of Demmin, a contingent of crusaders was diverted by the margraves to attack [[Pomerania]] instead. They reached the already Christian city [[Szczecin|Stettin]], whereupon the crusaders dispersed after meeting with Bishop [[Adalbert of Pomerania]] and Prince [[Ratibor I of Pomerania]]. According to Bernard of Clairvaux, the goal of the crusade was to battle the pagan Slavs \"until such a time as, by God's help, they shall either be converted or deleted\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=53}}\n\nHowever, the crusade failed to achieve the conversion of most of the Wends. The Saxons achieved largely token conversions at Dobin, as the Slavs resorted to their pagan beliefs once the Christian armies dispersed. Albert of Pomerania explained, \"If they had come to strengthen the Christian faith ... they should do so by preaching, not by arms\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=54}}\n\nBy the end of the crusade, the countryside of [[Mecklenburg]] and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion.{{sfn|Barraclough|1984|p=263}} This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=327}}\n\n== Reconquista and the fall of Lisbon ==\n{{main|Siege of Lisbon|Siege of Tortosa (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg|thumb|''The Siege of Lisbon by D. Afonso Henriques'' by Joaquim Rodrigues Braga (1840)|alt=Painting of a group of men clustered around a seated man in armor wearing a crown. Kneeling before the seated man is another man, with a third man standing between the two men and pointing at the kneeling man.]]\nIn the spring of 1147, the Pope authorized the expansion of the crusade into the [[Iberian peninsula]], in the context of the [[Reconquista]]. He also authorized [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] to equate his campaigns against the [[Moors]] with the rest of the Second Crusade.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in England for the [[Holy Land]]. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the northern city of [[Porto]] on 16 June 1147. There they were convinced to meet with [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King]] [[Afonso I of Portugal]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}}\n\nThe crusaders agreed to help the King attack [[Lisbon]], with a solemn agreement that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The [[Siege of Lisbon]] lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, but some of them set sail and continued to the Holy Land.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}} Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped [[Conquest of Santar\u00e9m|capture Santar\u00e9m]] earlier in the same year. Later they also helped to conquer [[Sintra]], [[Almada]], [[Palmela]] and [[Set\u00fabal]], and they were allowed to stay in the conquered lands, where they settled down and had offspring.\n\nElsewhere on the Iberian peninsula, almost at the same time, King [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]], Count [[Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona]], and others led a mixed army of [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]], Leonese, Castilians and [[France in the Middle Ages|French]] crusaders against the rich port city of [[Almer\u00eda]]. With support from a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]\u2013[[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, the city was occupied in October 1147.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}}\n\nRamon Berenger then invaded the lands of the [[Almoravid]] [[taifa]] kingdom of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Murcia]]. In December 1148, he [[Siege of Tortosa (1148)|captured Tortosa]] after a five-month siege again with the help of French, [[Anglo-Normans]] and Genoese crusaders.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} The next year, [[Fraga]], [[Lleida]] and [[Mequinenza]] in the confluence of the [[Segre River|Segre]] and [[Ebro]] rivers fell to his army.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\n== Forces ==\n\n=== Islamic ===\n[[File:Map Crusader states 1135-en.svg|The Near East in 1135. Crusader states are marked with a red cross.|thumb|right]]\nThe professional soldiers of the Muslim states, who were usually ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]], tended to be very well-trained and equipped. The basis of the military system in the Islamic Middle East was the ''[[iqta']]'' system of fiefs, which supported a certain number of troops in every district. In the event of war, the ''[[ahdath]]'' militias, based in the cities under the command of the ''ra\u2019is'' (chief), and who were usually ethnic [[Arab]]s, were called upon to increase the number of troops. The ''ahdath'' militia, though less well trained than the Turkish professional troops, were often very strongly motivated by religion, especially the concept of ''[[jihad]]''. Further support came from [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] and [[Kurd]]ish auxiliaries, who could be called upon in times of war, though these forces were prone to indiscipline.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 28\u201330}}\n\nThe principal Islamic commander was [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur|Mu'in al-Din Anur]], the ''atabeg'' of Damascus from 1138 to 1149. Damascus was supposedly ruled by the [[Burid amirs]] of Damascus, but Anur, who commanded the military, was the real ruler of the city. The historian David Nicolle described Anur as an able general and diplomat, also well known as a patron of the arts. Because the Burid dynasty was displaced in 1154 by the Zangid dynasty, Anur's role in repulsing the Second Crusade has been largely erased with historians and chroniclers loyal to the Zangids giving the credit to Anur's rival, Nur ad-Din Zangi, the amir of Aleppo.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 19\u201321}}\n\n=== Crusaders ===\nThe German contingent comprised about 20,000 knights; the French contingent had about 700 knights from the king's lands while the nobility raised smaller numbers of knights; and the Kingdom of Jerusalem had about 950 knights and 6,000 infantrymen.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 24}}\n\nThe French knights preferred to fight on horseback, while the German knights liked to fight on foot. The [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] chronicler [[John Kinnamos]] wrote \"the French are particularly capable of riding horseback in good order and attacking with the spear, and their cavalry surpasses that of the Germans in speed. The Germans, however, are able to fight on foot better than the French and excel in using the great sword\".{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 26\u201327}}\n\nConrad III was considered to be a brave knight, though often described as indecisive in moments of crisis.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 17}} Louis VII was a devout Christian with a sensitive side who was often attacked by contemporaries like Bernard of Clairvaux for being more in love with his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], than being interested in war or politics.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 18}}\n\n== Crusade in the East ==\n[[File:Deuxi\u00e8me croisade.JPG|thumb|Map of Second Crusade]]\n\nJoscelin II tried to re-take Edessa following Zengi's murder, but Nur ad-Din defeated him in November 1146. On 16 February 1147, the French crusaders met at [[\u00c9tampes]] to discuss their route. The Germans had already decided to travel overland through Hungary; they regarded the sea route as politically impractical because [[Roger II of Sicily]] was an enemy of Conrad. Many of the French nobles distrusted the land route, which would take them through the [[Byzantine Empire]], the reputation of which still suffered from the accounts of the [[First Crusade]]rs. Nevertheless, the French decided to follow Conrad, and to set out on 15 June. Roger II took offence and refused to participate any longer. In France, [[Abbot Suger]] was elected by a great council at [[\u00c9tampes]] (and appointed by the Pope) to act as one of the regents during the king's absence on crusade. In Germany, further preaching was done by [[Adam of Ebrach]], and [[Otto of Freising]] also took the cross. The Germans planned to set out at [[Easter]], but did not leave until May.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 257, 259}}\n\n=== German route ===\nThe German crusaders, accompanied by the [[papal legate]] and [[cardinal (religion)|cardinal]] [[Theodwin of Santa Rufina|Theodwin]], intended to meet the French in [[Constantinople]]. [[Ottokar III of Styria]] joined Conrad at [[Vienna]], and Conrad's enemy [[G\u00e9za II of Hungary]] allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] feared they were going to attack him, and had Byzantine troops posted to ensure against trouble. A brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans occurred near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] and in [[Adrianople]], where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad's nephew, the future emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]]. To make matters worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor, resulting in a [[Battle of Constantinople (1147)|battle]], after which the Germans became convinced that they should cross into [[Asia Minor]] as quickly as possible.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 42}} Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece, but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 259\u2013267}}\n\nIn Asia Minor, Conrad decided not to wait for the French, but marched towards [[Iconium]], capital of the [[Seljuq Turks|Seljuq]] [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]]. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the authority of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 43}} Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} The Seljuqs almost totally destroyed King Conrad's party on 25 October 1147 at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1147)|second battle of Dorylaeum]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}\n\nIn battle, the Turks used their typical tactic of pretending to retreat, and then returning to attack the small force of German cavalry which had separated from the main army to chase them. Conrad began a slow retreat back to Constantinople, his army harassed daily by the Turks, who attacked stragglers and defeated the rearguard.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 47}} Conrad himself was wounded in a skirmish with them. The other division of the German force, led by the King's half-brother, Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], had marched south to the Mediterranean coast and was similarly defeated early in 1148.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 267\u2013270}} The force led by Otto ran out of food while crossing inhospitable countryside and was ambushed by the Seljuq Turks near Laodicea on 16 November 1147. The majority of Otto's force were either killed in battle or captured and sold into slavery.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}}\n\n=== French route ===\n[[File:C croisade2 Louis7.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis VII of France]]\nThe French crusaders had departed from [[Metz]] in June 1147, led by Louis, [[Thierry, Count of Flanders|Thierry of Alsace]], [[Renaut I of Bar]], [[Amadeus III of Savoy]] and his half-brother [[William V of Montferrat]], William VII of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and others, along with armies from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Brittany]], [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Aquitaine]]. A force from [[Provence]], led by Alphonse of Toulouse, chose to wait until August, and to cross by sea. At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Louis joined with crusaders from [[Normandy]] and England. They followed Conrad's route fairly peacefully, although Louis came into conflict with king G\u00e9za of [[Hungary]] when G\u00e9za discovered that Louis had allowed a failed Hungarian usurper, [[Boris Kalamanos]], to join his army. Relations within Byzantine territory were also grim, and the Lorrainers, who had marched ahead of the rest of the French, also came into conflict with the slower Germans whom they met on the way.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=259\u2013263}}\n\nSince the original negotiations between Louis and Manuel I, Manuel had broken off his military campaign against R\u00fbm, signing a truce with his enemy Sultan [[Mesud I]]. Manuel did this to give himself a free hand to concentrate on defending his empire from the Crusaders, who had gained a reputation for theft and treachery since the [[First Crusade]] and were widely suspected of harbouring sinister designs on [[Constantinople]]. Nevertheless, Manuel's relations with the French army were somewhat better than with the Germans, and Louis was entertained lavishly in Constantinople. Some of the French were outraged by Manuel's truce with the Seljuqs and called for an alliance with Roger II and an attack on Constantinople, but Louis restrained them.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\n[[File:Manuelcomnenus.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Manuel I|alt= A standing male, dressed in elaborate robes with a fancy hat. He has a halo around his head and is holding a long staff in one hand.]]\n\nWhen the armies from Savoy, [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]] and [[Montferrat]] joined Louis in Constantinople, having taken the land route through Italy and crossing from [[Brindisi]] to [[Durazzo]], the entire army took ship across the [[Bosporus]] to [[Asia Minor]]. The Greeks were encouraged by rumours that the Germans had captured [[Iconium]] (Konya), but Manuel refused to give Louis any Byzantine troops. [[Roger II of Sicily]] had just invaded Byzantine territory, and Manuel needed all his army in the [[Peloponnese]]. Both the Germans and French therefore entered Asia without any Byzantine assistance, unlike the armies of the First Crusade. Following the example set by his grandfather [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], Manuel had the French swear to return to the Empire any territory they captured.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p= 269}}\n\nThe French met the remnants of Conrad's army at [[Lopadion]], and Conrad joined Louis's force. They followed Otto of Freising's route, moving closer to the Mediterranean coast, and arrived at [[Ephesus]] in December, where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them. Manuel also sent ambassadors complaining about the pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way, and there was no guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks. Meanwhile, Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople, where Manuel attended to him personally, and Louis, paying no attention to the warnings of a Turkish attack, marched out from Ephesus with the French and German survivors. The Turks were indeed waiting to attack, but in a [[Battle of Ephesus (1147)|small battle]] outside Ephesus on 24 December 1147, the French proved victorious.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 270\u2013271}} The French fended off [[Battle of the Meander|another Turkish ambush]] at the Meander River in the same month.\n\nThey reached [[Laodicea on the Lycus]] early in January 1148, just after Otto of Freising's army had been destroyed in the same area.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=51}} Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated from the rest of the army [[Battle of Mount Cadmus|at Mount Cadmus]], where Louis's troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks (6 January 1148). Louis himself, according to [[Odo of Deuil]], climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did not bother to attack further and the French marched on to [[Antalya|Adalia]], continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and to sail for Antioch.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch. The army was almost entirely destroyed, either by the Turks or by sickness.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 272\u2013273}}\n\n=== Journey to Jerusalem ===\n[[File:RaymondOfPoitiersWelcomingLouisVIIinAntioch.JPG|thumb|Raymond of Poitiers welcoming Louis VII in Antioch|alt= Painting of two men meeting in front of a city gate.

The one on the left is bareheaded and holds his hat in one hand while he bows to the other figure, who is dressed in blue embroidered robes and wears a crown.]]\nThough delayed by storms, Louis eventually arrived in Antioch on 19 March; Amadeus of Savoy had died on [[Cyprus]] along the way. Louis was welcomed by Eleanor's uncle [[Raymond of Poitiers]]. Raymond expected him to help defend against the Turks and to accompany him on an expedition against Aleppo, the Muslim city that functioned as the gateway to Edessa, but Louis refused, preferring instead to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the crusade.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Eleanor enjoyed her stay, but her uncle implored her to remain to enlarge family lands and divorce Louis if the king refused to help what was assuredly the military cause of the Crusade.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} During this period, there were rumours of an affair between Raymond and Eleanor, which caused tensions in the marriage between Louis and Eleanor.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 18, 54}} Louis quickly left Antioch for [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]] with Eleanor under arrest. Meanwhile, [[Otto of Freising]] and the remnant of his troops arrived in Jerusalem early in April, and Conrad soon after.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|pp= 49\u201350}} [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk]], the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], was sent to invite Louis to join them. The fleet that had stopped at Lisbon arrived around this time, as well as the Proven\u00e7als who had left Europe under the command of [[Alfonso Jordan]], [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]]. Alfonso himself did not reach Jerusalem; he died at [[Caesarea]], supposedly poisoned by [[Raymond II of Tripoli]], the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county. The claim that Raymond had poisoned Alfonso caused much of the Proven\u00e7al force to turn back and return home.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} The original focus of the crusade was [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], but the preferred target of [[King Baldwin III]] and of the [[Knights Templar]] was [[Damascus]].{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp=115\u2013121}}\n\nIn response to the arrival of the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Unur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Unur might lose his city to the Crusaders.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 55}}\n\n=== Council of Palmarea ===\n{{main|Council of Acre}}\nThe nobility of Jerusalem welcomed the arrival of troops from Europe. A council to decide on the best target for the crusaders took place on 24 June 1148, when the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem]] met with the recently arrived crusaders from Europe at Palmarea, near [[Akko|Acre]], a major city of the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. This was the most spectacular meeting of the Court in its existence.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}{{sfn|William of Tyre|Babcock|Krey|1943|loc= vol. 2, bk. 17, ch. 1, pp. 184\u2013185: \"it seems well worth while and quite in harmony with the present history that the names of the nobles who were present at the council... should be recorded here for the benefit of posterity&nbsp;... to name each one individually would take far too long.\"}}\n\nIn the end, the decision was made to attack the city of Damascus, a former ally of the Kingdom of Jerusalem that had shifted its allegiance to that of the Zengids, and attacked the Kingdom's allied city of [[Battle of Bosra (1147)|Bosra]] in 1147.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 54\u201355}} Historians have long seen the decision to besiege Damascus rather than Edessa as \"an act of inexplicable folly\". Noting the tensions between Unur, the ''atabeg'' of Damascus, and the growing power of the Zangids, many historians have argued that it would have been better for the Crusaders to focus their energy against the Zangids. More recently, historians such as David Nicolle have defended the decision to attack Damascus, arguing that Damascus was the most powerful Muslim state in southern Syria, and that if the Christians held Damascus, they would have been in a better position to resist the rising power of [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]]. Since Unur was clearly the weaker of the two Muslim rulers, it was believed that it was inevitable that Nur ad-Din would take Damascus sometime in the near future, and thus it seemed better for the Crusaders to hold that city rather than the Zangids.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 37\u201338}} In July their armies assembled at [[Tiberias]] and marched to Damascus, around the [[Sea of Galilee]] by way of [[Banyas]]. There were perhaps 50,000 troops in total.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=228\u2013229}}\n\n=== Siege of Damascus ===\n{{main|Siege of Damascus (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Damascus.jpg|thumb|Siege of Damascus]]\nThe crusaders decided to attack Damascus from the west, where [[orchard]]s would provide them with a constant food supply.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July. The following day, the Muslims were prepared for the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. The defenders had sought help from [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]] of [[Mosul]] and Nur ad-Din of [[Aleppo]], who personally led an attack on the crusader camp. The crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards, leaving them exposed to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Tyre]], on 27 July the crusaders decided to move to the plain on the eastern side of the city, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible for the Crusaders to return to their better position.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by [[Seljuqids|Turkish]] archers who constantly harassed them.{{sfn|Baldwin|Setton|1969|p= 510}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|left|266px|The Mediterranean world after the Second Crusade in 1173|alt=Map showing the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.

The center of the north coast is held by the Holy Roman Empire and the northwest coast is held by the kingdoms of France and Aragon.]]\n\nEach of the Christian forces felt betrayed by the other.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=50}} A new plan was made to attack [[Ashkelon|Ascalon]] and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, due to the lack of trust that had resulted from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 77}}\n\nBack in Europe, [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his ''Book of Consideration''. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}} He would die in 1153.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}}\n\nThe cultural impact of the Second Crusade was even greater in France, with many [[troubadour]]s fascinated by the alleged affair between Eleanor and Raymond, which helped to feed the theme of courtly love. Unlike Conrad, the image of Louis was improved by the Crusade with many of the French seeing him as a suffering pilgrim king who quietly bore God's punishments.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81\u201384}}\n\n[[File:Saladin's Conquest (1174-1189).jpg|thumb|right|320px|Map of [[Saladin]]'s Conquest into [[the Levant]]]]\n\nRelations between the Eastern Roman Empire and the French were badly damaged by the Crusade. Louis and other French leaders openly accused the Emperor Manuel I of colluding with Turkish attacks on them during the march across Asia Minor. The memory of the Second Crusade was to color French views of the Byzantines for the rest of the 12th and 13th centuries. Within the empire itself, the crusade was remembered as a triumph of diplomacy.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}} In the eulogy for the Emperor Manuel by Archbishop [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], it was declared:\n\n<blockquote>He was able to deal with his enemies with enviable skill, playing off one against the other with the aim of bringing peace and tranquility{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}}</blockquote>\n\nThe preliminary Wendish Crusade achieved mixed results. While the Saxons affirmed their possession of Wagria and Polabia, pagans retained control of the Obodrite land east of L\u00fcbeck. The Saxons also received tribute from Chief Niklot, enabled the colonization of the [[Bishopric of Havelberg]], and freed some [[Danes|Danish]] prisoners. However, the disparate Christian leaders regarded their counterparts with suspicion and accused each other of sabotaging the campaign. In Iberia, the campaigns in Spain, along with the siege of Lisbon, were some of the few lasting Christian victories of the Second Crusade. They are seen as pivotal battles of the wider Reconquista, which would be completed in 1492.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\nIn the East the situation was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. In 1149, the ''atabeg'' Anur died, at which point the amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ''ra'is'' of Damascus and commander of the ''ahdath'' military Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ''ahdath'' had played a major role in defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}} The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81}} Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}}\n\nBaldwin III finally [[Siege of Ascalon|seized Ascalon]] in 1153, which brought [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] into the sphere of conflict. Jerusalem was able to make further advances into Egypt, briefly occupying [[Cairo]] in the 1160s.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=56}} However, relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed, and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the disaster of the Second Crusade. King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of Egypt in 1169, but the expedition ultimately failed. In 1171, [[Saladin]], nephew of one of Nur ad-Din's generals, was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt, uniting [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]] in 1180, and in 1187, [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Jerusalem capitulated]] to Saladin. His forces then spread north to capture all but the capital cities of the Crusader States, precipitating the [[Third Crusade]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=60}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin|colwidth=30em}}\n*{{cite book|author=Bunson, Matthew, Margaret, & Stephen|title=Our Sunday Visitor's Encyclopedia of Saints| publisher = Our Sunday Visitor| location = Huntington|year=1998| isbn = 978-0-87973-588-3 |ref=CITEREFBunson1998 }}\n* {{cite book | last = Baldwin | first = Mrshall W. |last2=Setton  |first2=Kenneth M. | title =A History of the Crusades, Volume I: The First Hundred Years | location = Madison, Wisconsin | publisher = University of Wisconsin Press | year = 1969 | ref = harv }}\n* {{cite book | last = Barraclough | first = Geoffrey |author-link=Geoffrey Barraclough | title = The Origins of Modern Germany | year = 1984 | publisher = W.

Crusade}}\n{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}\n}}\nThe '''Second Crusade''' (1147\u20131150) was the second major [[crusade]] launched from Europe. The Second Crusade was started in response to the [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|fall]] of the [[County of Edessa]] in 1144 to the forces of [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]]. The county had been founded during the [[First Crusade]] (1096\u20131099) by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] in 1098. While it was the first [[Crusader state]] to be founded, it was also the first to fall.\n\nThe Second Crusade was announced by [[Pope Eugene III]], and was the first of the crusades to be led by European kings, namely [[Louis VII of France]] and [[Conrad III of Germany]], with help from a number of other European nobles. The armies of the two kings marched separately across Europe. After crossing [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] territory into [[Anatolia]], both armies were separately defeated by the [[Seljuk Turks]]. The main Western Christian source, [[Odo of Deuil]], and [[Syriac Christian]] sources claim that the [[Byzantine Emperor]] [[Manuel I Komnenos]] secretly hindered the crusaders' progress, particularly in Anatolia, where he is alleged to have deliberately ordered Turks to attack them. Louis and Conrad and the remnants of their armies reached [[Jerusalem]] and participated in 1148 in an ill-advised attack on [[Damascus]]. The crusade in the east was a failure for the crusaders and a great victory for the [[Muslims]]. It would ultimately have a key influence on the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] and give rise to the [[Third Crusade]] at the end of the 12th century.\n\nThe only significant Christian success of the Second Crusade came to a combined force of 13,000 Flemish, Frisian, Norman, English, Scottish, and German crusaders in 1147. Travelling from England, by ship, to the [[Holy Land]], the army stopped and helped the smaller (7,000) Portuguese army in the [[Siege of Lisbon|capture of Lisbon]], expelling its [[Moorish]] occupants.\n\n== Background: the fall of Edessa ==\n{{main|Siege of Edessa (1144)}}\nAfter the [[First Crusade]] and the minor [[Crusade of 1101]], there were three [[crusader state]]s established in the east: the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], the [[Principality of Antioch]] and the [[County of Edessa]]. A fourth, the [[County of Tripoli]], was established in 1109. Edessa was the most northerly of these, and also the weakest and least populated; as such, it was subject to frequent attacks from the surrounding Muslim states ruled by the [[Ortoqids]], [[Danishmends]] and [[Seljuq Turks]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|2005|pp=50\u201353}} Count [[Baldwin II of Jerusalem|Baldwin II]] and future count [[Joscelin I of Edessa|Joscelin of Courtenay]] were taken captive after their defeat at the [[Battle of Harran]] in 1104. Baldwin and Joscelin were both captured a second time in 1122, and although Edessa recovered somewhat after the [[Battle of Azaz (1125)|Battle of Azaz]] in 1125, Joscelin was killed in battle in 1131. His successor [[Joscelin II of Edessa|Joscelin II]] was forced into an alliance with the [[Byzantine Empire]], but in 1143 both the [[list of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[John II Comnenus]] and the [[King of Jerusalem]] [[Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk of Anjou]] died. Joscelin had also quarreled with the Count of Tripoli and the Prince of Antioch, leaving Edessa with no powerful allies.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}}\n\nMeanwhile, the Seljuq [[Imad ad-Din Zengi|Zengi]], [[Atabeg]] of [[Mosul]], had added to his rule in 1128 [[Aleppo]], the key to power in Syria, contested between the rulers of Mosul and [[Damascus]]. Both Zengi and King Baldwin II turned their attention towards Damascus; Baldwin was defeated outside the great city in 1129.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=185\u2013189}} Damascus, ruled by the [[Burid Dynasty]], later allied with King Fulk when Zengi besieged the city in 1139 and 1140;{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=227\u2013228}} the alliance was negotiated by the chronicler [[Usamah ibn Munqidh]].<ref>[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5440995n.image.r=Ous%C3%A2ma+ibn+Mounkidh.f203.langEN Ous\u00e2ma ibn Mounkidh, un \u00e9mir syrien au premier si\u00e8cle des croisades, p.182 (in BnF)]</ref>\n\nIn late 1144, Joscelin II allied with the Ortoqids and marched out of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] with almost his entire army to support the Ortoqid army against Aleppo. Zengi, already seeking to take advantage of Fulk's death in 1143, hurried north to [[Siege of Edessa (1144)|besiege Edessa]], which fell to him after a month on 24 December 1144. [[Manasses of Hierges]], [[Philip of Milly]] and others were sent from Jerusalem to assist, but arrived too late. Joscelin II continued to rule the remnants of the county from [[Turbessel]], but little by little the rest of the territory was captured by Muslims or sold to the Byzantines. Zengi himself was praised throughout Islam as \"defender of the faith\" and ''al-Malik al-Mansur'', \"the victorious king\". He did not pursue an attack on the remaining territory of Edessa, or the Principality of Antioch, as was feared. Events in Mosul compelled him to return home, and he once again set his sights on Damascus. However, he was [[Assassination|assassinated]] by a slave in 1146 and was succeeded in Aleppo by his son [[Nur ad-Din Zangi|Nur ad-Din]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=225\u2013244}}\n\n=== ''Quantum praedecessores'' ===\n{{main|Quantum praedecessores}}\nThe news of the fall of Edessa was brought back to Europe first by pilgrims early in 1145, and then by embassies from Antioch, Jerusalem and Armenia. Bishop [[Hugh of Jabala]] reported the news to [[Pope Eugene III]], who issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Quantum praedecessores]]'' on 1 December of that year, calling for a second crusade.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=273\u2013275}} Hugh also told the Pope of an eastern Christian king, who, it was hoped, would bring relief to the crusader states: this is the first documented mention of [[Prester John]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=247}} Eugene did not control Rome and lived instead at [[Viterbo]],{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=289}} but nevertheless the Second Crusade was meant to be more organized and centrally controlled than the First: the armies would be led by the strongest kings of Europe and a route would be planned beforehand.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|p=298}}\n\nThe initial response to the new crusade bull was poor, and it in fact had to be reissued when it was clear that [[Louis VII of France]] would be taking part in the expedition. Louis VII had also been considering a new expedition independently of the Pope, which he announced to his Christmas court at Bourges in 1145. It is debatable whether Louis was planning a crusade of his own or in fact a pilgrimage, as he wanted to fulfil a vow made by his dead brother Philip to go to the Holy Land. It is probable that Louis had made this decision independently of hearing about ''Quantum Praedecessores''. In any case, [[Abbot Suger]] and other nobles were not in favour of Louis's plans, as he would be gone from the kingdom for several years. Louis consulted [[Bernard of Clairvaux]], who referred him back to Eugene. By now Louis would have definitely heard about the papal bull, and Eugene enthusiastically supported Louis's crusade. The bull was reissued on 1 March 1146, and Eugene authorized Bernard to preach the news throughout France.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\n== Saint Bernard of Clairvaux ==\n[[File:Stained glass St Bernard MNMA Cl3273.jpg|150px|thumb|left|St Bernard in stained glass, from the Upper Rhine, c. 1450|alt=Stained glass image of a kneeling man with a halo holding an open book and a staff]]\nThe Pope commissioned French abbot [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] to preach the Second Crusade, and granted the same [[indulgence]]s for it which [[Pope Urban II]] had accorded to the [[First Crusade]].{{sfn|Bunson|1998|p=130}} A [[Council of V\u00e9zelay (1146)|parliament]] was convoked at [[Vezelay]] in Burgundy in 1146, and Bernard preached before the assembly on 31 March. [[Louis VII of France]], his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], and the princes and lords present prostrated themselves at the feet of Bernard to receive the pilgrims' cross. Bernard then passed into Germany, and the reported miracles which multiplied almost at his every step undoubtedly contributed to the success of his mission. At Speyer, [[Conrad III of Germany]] and his nephew, later Holy Roman Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick Barbarossa]], received the cross from the hand of Bernard.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} Pope Eugene came in person to France to encourage the enterprise.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=275\u2013281}}\n\nFor all his overmastering zeal, Bernard was by nature neither a bigot nor a persecutor. As in the First Crusade, the preaching inadvertently led to attacks on [[Jews]]; a fanatical French monk named [[Radulphe|Rudolf]] was apparently inspiring massacres of Jews in the [[Rhineland]], [[Cologne]], [[Mainz]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Speyer]], with Rudolf claiming Jews were not contributing financially to the rescue of the Holy Land. Bernard, the [[Archbishop of Cologne]] and the [[Archbishop of Mainz]] were vehemently opposed to these attacks, and so Bernard traveled from Flanders to Germany to deal with the problem and quiet the mobs. Bernard then found Rudolf in Mainz and was able to silence him, returning him to his monastery.{{sfn|Tyerman|2006|pp=281\u2013288}}\n\n== Wendish Crusade ==\n{{Main|Wendish Crusade}}\nWhen the Second Crusade was called, many [[Southern Germany|south Germans]] volunteered to crusade in the [[Holy Land]]. The [[Northern Germany|north German]] Saxons were reluctant. They told St Bernard of their desire to campaign against pagan Slavs at an [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] meeting in [[Frankfurt]] on 13 March 1147. Approving of the Saxons' plan, Eugenius issued a [[papal bull]] known as the ''Divina dispensatione'' on 13 April. This bull stated that there was to be no difference between the spiritual rewards of the different crusaders. Those who volunteered to crusade against the pagan Slavs were primarily [[Danes (Germanic tribe)|Danes]], [[Saxons]] and [[Poles]],{{sfn|Davies|1996|p=362}} although there were also some [[Bohemia]]ns.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=326}} The [[Papal legate]], [[Anselm of Havelberg]], was placed in overall command. The campaign itself was led by Saxon families such as the [[House of Ascania|Ascanians]], [[House of Wettin|Wettin]] and [[Counts of Schauenburg and Holstein|Schauenburgers]].{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=328}}\n\nUpset by German participation in the crusade, the [[Obotrites]] preemptively invaded [[Wagria]] in [[Holstein]] in June 1147, leading to the march of the crusaders in late summer 1147. After expelling the Obodrites from Christian territory, the crusaders targeted the Obodrite fort at [[Dobin am See|Dobin]] and the [[Liutizian]] fort at [[Demmin]]. The forces attacking Dobin included those of the Danes [[Canute V of Denmark|Canute V]] and [[Sweyn III of Denmark|Sweyn III]], Adalbert II, [[Archbishop of Bremen]] and Duke [[Henry the Lion]] of [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]]. When some crusaders advocated ravaging the countryside, others objected by asking, \"Is not the land we are devastating our land, and the people we are fighting our people?\"{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=55}} The Saxon army under Henry the Lion withdrew after the pagan chief, [[Niklot]], agreed to have Dobin's garrison undergo [[baptism]].\n\nAfter an unsuccessful siege of Demmin, a contingent of crusaders was diverted by the margraves to attack [[Pomerania]] instead. They reached the already Christian city [[Szczecin|Stettin]], whereupon the crusaders dispersed after meeting with Bishop [[Adalbert of Pomerania]] and Prince [[Ratibor I of Pomerania]]. According to Bernard of Clairvaux, the goal of the crusade was to battle the pagan Slavs \"until such a time as, by God's help, they shall either be converted or deleted\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=53}}\n\nHowever, the crusade failed to achieve the conversion of most of the Wends. The Saxons achieved largely token conversions at Dobin, as the Slavs resorted to their pagan beliefs once the Christian armies dispersed. Albert of Pomerania explained, \"If they had come to strengthen the Christian faith ... they should do so by preaching, not by arms\".{{sfn|Christiansen|1997|p=54}}\n\nBy the end of the crusade, the countryside of [[Mecklenburg]] and Pomerania was plundered and depopulated with much bloodshed, especially by the troops of Henry the Lion.{{sfn|Barraclough|1984|p=263}} This was to help bring about more Christian victories in the future decades. The Slavic inhabitants also lost much of their methods of production, limiting their resistance in the future.{{sfn|Herrmann|1970|p=327}}\n\n== Reconquista and the fall of Lisbon ==\n{{main|Siege of Lisbon|Siege of Tortosa (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Lisbon - Muslim surrender.jpg|thumb|''The Siege of Lisbon by D. Afonso Henriques'' by Joaquim Rodrigues Braga (1840)|alt=Painting of a group of men clustered around a seated man in armor wearing a crown. Kneeling before the seated man is another man, with a third man standing between the two men and pointing at the kneeling man.]]\nIn the spring of 1147, the Pope authorized the expansion of the crusade into the [[Iberian peninsula]], in the context of the [[Reconquista]]. He also authorized [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n and Castile]] to equate his campaigns against the [[Moors]] with the rest of the Second Crusade.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}} In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from [[Dartmouth, Devon|Dartmouth]] in England for the [[Holy Land]]. Bad weather forced the ships to stop on the Portuguese coast, at the northern city of [[Porto]] on 16 June 1147. There they were convinced to meet with [[List of Portuguese monarchs|King]] [[Afonso I of Portugal]].{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}}\n\nThe crusaders agreed to help the King attack [[Lisbon]], with a solemn agreement that offered to them the pillage of the city's goods and the ransom money for expected prisoners. The [[Siege of Lisbon]] lasted from 1 July to 25 October 1147 when, after four months, the Moorish rulers agreed to surrender, primarily due to hunger within the city. Most of the crusaders settled in the newly captured city, but some of them set sail and continued to the Holy Land.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p=258}} Some of them, who had departed earlier, helped [[Conquest of Santar\u00e9m|capture Santar\u00e9m]] earlier in the same year. Later they also helped to conquer [[Sintra]], [[Almada]], [[Palmela]] and [[Set\u00fabal]], and they were allowed to stay in the conquered lands, where they settled down and had offspring.\n\nElsewhere on the Iberian peninsula, almost at the same time, King [[Alfonso VII of Le\u00f3n]], Count [[Ramon Berenguer IV of Barcelona]], and others led a mixed army of [[History of Catalonia|Catalans]], Leonese, Castilians and [[France in the Middle Ages|French]] crusaders against the rich port city of [[Almer\u00eda]]. With support from a [[Republic of Genoa|Genoese]]\u2013[[Republic of Pisa|Pisan]] navy, the city was occupied in October 1147.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=48}}\n\nRamon Berenger then invaded the lands of the [[Almoravid]] [[taifa]] kingdom of [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] and [[Murcia]].

Crusader states are marked with a red cross.|thumb|right]]\nThe professional soldiers of the Muslim states, who were usually ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks]], tended to be very well-trained and equipped. The basis of the military system in the Islamic Middle East was the ''[[iqta']]'' system of fiefs, which supported a certain number of troops in every district. In the event of war, the ''[[ahdath]]'' militias, based in the cities under the command of the ''ra\u2019is'' (chief), and who were usually ethnic [[Arab]]s, were called upon to increase the number of troops. The ''ahdath'' militia, though less well trained than the Turkish professional troops, were often very strongly motivated by religion, especially the concept of ''[[jihad]]''. Further support came from [[Turkmen people|Turkoman]] and [[Kurd]]ish auxiliaries, who could be called upon in times of war, though these forces were prone to indiscipline.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 28\u201330}}\n\nThe principal Islamic commander was [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur|Mu'in al-Din Anur]], the ''atabeg'' of Damascus from 1138 to 1149. Damascus was supposedly ruled by the [[Burid amirs]] of Damascus, but Anur, who commanded the military, was the real ruler of the city. The historian David Nicolle described Anur as an able general and diplomat, also well known as a patron of the arts. Because the Burid dynasty was displaced in 1154 by the Zangid dynasty, Anur's role in repulsing the Second Crusade has been largely erased with historians and chroniclers loyal to the Zangids giving the credit to Anur's rival, Nur ad-Din Zangi, the amir of Aleppo.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 19\u201321}}\n\n=== Crusaders ===\nThe German contingent comprised about 20,000 knights; the French contingent had about 700 knights from the king's lands while the nobility raised smaller numbers of knights; and the Kingdom of Jerusalem had about 950 knights and 6,000 infantrymen.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 24}}\n\nThe French knights preferred to fight on horseback, while the German knights liked to fight on foot. The [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantine Greek]] chronicler [[John Kinnamos]] wrote \"the French are particularly capable of riding horseback in good order and attacking with the spear, and their cavalry surpasses that of the Germans in speed. The Germans, however, are able to fight on foot better than the French and excel in using the great sword\".{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 26\u201327}}\n\nConrad III was considered to be a brave knight, though often described as indecisive in moments of crisis.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 17}} Louis VII was a devout Christian with a sensitive side who was often attacked by contemporaries like Bernard of Clairvaux for being more in love with his wife, [[Eleanor of Aquitaine]], than being interested in war or politics.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 18}}\n\n== Crusade in the East ==\n[[File:Deuxi\u00e8me croisade.JPG|thumb|Map of Second Crusade]]\n\nJoscelin II tried to re-take Edessa following Zengi's murder, but Nur ad-Din defeated him in November 1146. On 16 February 1147, the French crusaders met at [[\u00c9tampes]] to discuss their route. The Germans had already decided to travel overland through Hungary; they regarded the sea route as politically impractical because [[Roger II of Sicily]] was an enemy of Conrad. Many of the French nobles distrusted the land route, which would take them through the [[Byzantine Empire]], the reputation of which still suffered from the accounts of the [[First Crusade]]rs. Nevertheless, the French decided to follow Conrad, and to set out on 15 June. Roger II took offence and refused to participate any longer. In France, [[Abbot Suger]] was elected by a great council at [[\u00c9tampes]] (and appointed by the Pope) to act as one of the regents during the king's absence on crusade. In Germany, further preaching was done by [[Adam of Ebrach]], and [[Otto of Freising]] also took the cross. The Germans planned to set out at [[Easter]], but did not leave until May.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 257, 259}}\n\n=== German route ===\nThe German crusaders, accompanied by the [[papal legate]] and [[cardinal (religion)|cardinal]] [[Theodwin of Santa Rufina|Theodwin]], intended to meet the French in [[Constantinople]]. [[Ottokar III of Styria]] joined Conrad at [[Vienna]], and Conrad's enemy [[G\u00e9za II of Hungary]] allowed them to pass through unharmed. When the German army of 20,000 men arrived in Byzantine territory, Emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos]] feared they were going to attack him, and had Byzantine troops posted to ensure against trouble. A brief skirmish with some of the more unruly Germans occurred near [[Plovdiv|Philippopolis]] and in [[Adrianople]], where the Byzantine general Prosouch fought with Conrad's nephew, the future emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]]. To make matters worse, some of the German soldiers were killed in a flood at the beginning of September. On 10 September, however, they arrived at Constantinople, where relations with Manuel were poor, resulting in a [[Battle of Constantinople (1147)|battle]], after which the Germans became convinced that they should cross into [[Asia Minor]] as quickly as possible.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 42}} Manuel wanted Conrad to leave some of his troops behind, to assist in defending against attacks from Roger II, who had taken the opportunity to plunder the cities of Greece, but Conrad did not agree, despite being a fellow enemy of Roger.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 259\u2013267}}\n\nIn Asia Minor, Conrad decided not to wait for the French, but marched towards [[Iconium]], capital of the [[Seljuq Turks|Seljuq]] [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm]]. Conrad split his army into two divisions. Much of the authority of the Byzantine Empire in the western provinces of Asia Minor was more nominal than real, with much of the provinces being a no-man's land controlled by Turkish nomads.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 43}} Conrad underestimated the length of the march against Anatolia, and anyhow assumed that the authority of Emperor Manuel was greater in Anatolia than was in fact the case.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} Conrad took the knights and the best troops with himself to march overland while sending the camp followers with Otto of Freising to follow the coastal road.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}} The Seljuqs almost totally destroyed King Conrad's party on 25 October 1147 at the [[Battle of Dorylaeum (1147)|second battle of Dorylaeum]].{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}\n\nIn battle, the Turks used their typical tactic of pretending to retreat, and then returning to attack the small force of German cavalry which had separated from the main army to chase them. Conrad began a slow retreat back to Constantinople, his army harassed daily by the Turks, who attacked stragglers and defeated the rearguard.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 47}} Conrad himself was wounded in a skirmish with them. The other division of the German force, led by the King's half-brother, Bishop [[Otto of Freising]], had marched south to the Mediterranean coast and was similarly defeated early in 1148.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 267\u2013270}} The force led by Otto ran out of food while crossing inhospitable countryside and was ambushed by the Seljuq Turks near Laodicea on 16 November 1147. The majority of Otto's force were either killed in battle or captured and sold into slavery.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 46}}\n\n=== French route ===\n[[File:C croisade2 Louis7.jpg|thumb|200px|Louis VII of France]]\nThe French crusaders had departed from [[Metz]] in June 1147, led by Louis, [[Thierry, Count of Flanders|Thierry of Alsace]], [[Renaut I of Bar]], [[Amadeus III of Savoy]] and his half-brother [[William V of Montferrat]], William VII of [[Auvergne (province)|Auvergne]], and others, along with armies from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]], [[Brittany]], [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]] and [[Aquitaine]]. A force from [[Provence]], led by Alphonse of Toulouse, chose to wait until August, and to cross by sea. At [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Louis joined with crusaders from [[Normandy]] and England. They followed Conrad's route fairly peacefully, although Louis came into conflict with king G\u00e9za of [[Hungary]] when G\u00e9za discovered that Louis had allowed a failed Hungarian usurper, [[Boris Kalamanos]], to join his army. Relations within Byzantine territory were also grim, and the Lorrainers, who had marched ahead of the rest of the French, also came into conflict with the slower Germans whom they met on the way.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=259\u2013263}}\n\nSince the original negotiations between Louis and Manuel I, Manuel had broken off his military campaign against R\u00fbm, signing a truce with his enemy Sultan [[Mesud I]]. Manuel did this to give himself a free hand to concentrate on defending his empire from the Crusaders, who had gained a reputation for theft and treachery since the [[First Crusade]] and were widely suspected of harbouring sinister designs on [[Constantinople]]. Nevertheless, Manuel's relations with the French army were somewhat better than with the Germans, and Louis was entertained lavishly in Constantinople. Some of the French were outraged by Manuel's truce with the Seljuqs and called for an alliance with Roger II and an attack on Constantinople, but Louis restrained them.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=268\u2013269}}\n\n[[File:Manuelcomnenus.jpg|thumb|left|Emperor Manuel I|alt= A standing male, dressed in elaborate robes with a fancy hat.

The Greeks were encouraged by rumours that the Germans had captured [[Iconium]] (Konya), but Manuel refused to give Louis any Byzantine troops. [[Roger II of Sicily]] had just invaded Byzantine territory, and Manuel needed all his army in the [[Peloponnese]]. Both the Germans and French therefore entered Asia without any Byzantine assistance, unlike the armies of the First Crusade. Following the example set by his grandfather [[Alexios I Komnenos|Alexios I]], Manuel had the French swear to return to the Empire any territory they captured.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|p= 269}}\n\nThe French met the remnants of Conrad's army at [[Lopadion]], and Conrad joined Louis's force. They followed Otto of Freising's route, moving closer to the Mediterranean coast, and arrived at [[Ephesus]] in December, where they learned that the Turks were preparing to attack them. Manuel also sent ambassadors complaining about the pillaging and plundering that Louis had done along the way, and there was no guarantee that the Byzantines would assist them against the Turks. Meanwhile, Conrad fell sick and returned to Constantinople, where Manuel attended to him personally, and Louis, paying no attention to the warnings of a Turkish attack, marched out from Ephesus with the French and German survivors. The Turks were indeed waiting to attack, but in a [[Battle of Ephesus (1147)|small battle]] outside Ephesus on 24 December 1147, the French proved victorious.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 270\u2013271}} The French fended off [[Battle of the Meander|another Turkish ambush]] at the Meander River in the same month.\n\nThey reached [[Laodicea on the Lycus]] early in January 1148, just after Otto of Freising's army had been destroyed in the same area.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=51}} Resuming the march, the vanguard under Amadeus of Savoy became separated from the rest of the army [[Battle of Mount Cadmus|at Mount Cadmus]], where Louis's troops suffered heavy losses from the Turks (6 January 1148). Louis himself, according to [[Odo of Deuil]], climbed a rock and was ignored by the Turks, who did not recognize him. The Turks did not bother to attack further and the French marched on to [[Antalya|Adalia]], continually harassed from afar by the Turks, who had also burned the land to prevent the French from replenishing their food, both for themselves and their horses. Louis no longer wanted to continue by land, and it was decided to gather a fleet at Adalia and to sail for Antioch.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} After being delayed for a month by storms, most of the promised ships did not arrive at all. Louis and his associates claimed the ships for themselves, while the rest of the army had to resume the long march to Antioch. The army was almost entirely destroyed, either by the Turks or by sickness.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp= 272\u2013273}}\n\n=== Journey to Jerusalem ===\n[[File:RaymondOfPoitiersWelcomingLouisVIIinAntioch.JPG|thumb|Raymond of Poitiers welcoming Louis VII in Antioch|alt= Painting of two men meeting in front of a city gate.

Louis was welcomed by Eleanor's uncle [[Raymond of Poitiers]]. Raymond expected him to help defend against the Turks and to accompany him on an expedition against Aleppo, the Muslim city that functioned as the gateway to Edessa, but Louis refused, preferring instead to finish his pilgrimage to Jerusalem rather than focus on the military aspect of the crusade.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Eleanor enjoyed her stay, but her uncle implored her to remain to enlarge family lands and divorce Louis if the king refused to help what was assuredly the military cause of the Crusade.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} During this period, there were rumours of an affair between Raymond and Eleanor, which caused tensions in the marriage between Louis and Eleanor.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 18, 54}} Louis quickly left Antioch for [[County of Tripoli|Tripoli]] with Eleanor under arrest. Meanwhile, [[Otto of Freising]] and the remnant of his troops arrived in Jerusalem early in April, and Conrad soon after.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|pp= 49\u201350}} [[Patriarch Fulk of Jerusalem|Fulk]], the [[Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem]], was sent to invite Louis to join them. The fleet that had stopped at Lisbon arrived around this time, as well as the Proven\u00e7als who had left Europe under the command of [[Alfonso Jordan]], [[Counts of Toulouse|Count of Toulouse]]. Alfonso himself did not reach Jerusalem; he died at [[Caesarea]], supposedly poisoned by [[Raymond II of Tripoli]], the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county. The claim that Raymond had poisoned Alfonso caused much of the Proven\u00e7al force to turn back and return home.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 54}} The original focus of the crusade was [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]], but the preferred target of [[King Baldwin III]] and of the [[Knights Templar]] was [[Damascus]].{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp=115\u2013121}}\n\nIn response to the arrival of the Crusaders, the regent of Damascus, [[Mu'in ad-Din Unur]], started making feverish preparations for war, strengthening the fortifications of Damascus, ordering troops to his city and having the water sources along the road to Damascus destroyed or diverted. Unur sought help from the Zangid rulers of Aleppo and Mosul (who were normally his rivals), though forces from these states did not arrive in time to see combat outside of Damascus. It is almost certain that the Zangid rulers delayed sending troops to Damascus out of the hope that their rival Unur might lose his city to the Crusaders.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 55}}\n\n=== Council of Palmarea ===\n{{main|Council of Acre}}\nThe nobility of Jerusalem welcomed the arrival of troops from Europe. A council to decide on the best target for the crusaders took place on 24 June 1148, when the [[Haute Cour of Jerusalem]] met with the recently arrived crusaders from Europe at Palmarea, near [[Akko|Acre]], a major city of the [[crusade]]r [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]]. This was the most spectacular meeting of the Court in its existence.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}}{{sfn|William of Tyre|Babcock|Krey|1943|loc= vol. 2, bk. 17, ch. 1, pp. 184\u2013185: \"it seems well worth while and quite in harmony with the present history that the names of the nobles who were present at the council... should be recorded here for the benefit of posterity&nbsp;... to name each one individually would take far too long.\"}}\n\nIn the end, the decision was made to attack the city of Damascus, a former ally of the Kingdom of Jerusalem that had shifted its allegiance to that of the Zengids, and attacked the Kingdom's allied city of [[Battle of Bosra (1147)|Bosra]] in 1147.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 54\u201355}} Historians have long seen the decision to besiege Damascus rather than Edessa as \"an act of inexplicable folly\". Noting the tensions between Unur, the ''atabeg'' of Damascus, and the growing power of the Zangids, many historians have argued that it would have been better for the Crusaders to focus their energy against the Zangids. More recently, historians such as David Nicolle have defended the decision to attack Damascus, arguing that Damascus was the most powerful Muslim state in southern Syria, and that if the Christians held Damascus, they would have been in a better position to resist the rising power of [[Nur ad-Din (died 1174)|Nur ad-Din]]. Since Unur was clearly the weaker of the two Muslim rulers, it was believed that it was inevitable that Nur ad-Din would take Damascus sometime in the near future, and thus it seemed better for the Crusaders to hold that city rather than the Zangids.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 37\u201338}} In July their armies assembled at [[Tiberias]] and marched to Damascus, around the [[Sea of Galilee]] by way of [[Banyas]]. There were perhaps 50,000 troops in total.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=228\u2013229}}\n\n=== Siege of Damascus ===\n{{main|Siege of Damascus (1148)}}\n[[File:Siege of Damascus.jpg|thumb|Siege of Damascus]]\nThe crusaders decided to attack Damascus from the west, where [[orchard]]s would provide them with a constant food supply.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} They arrived at Daraiya on 23 July. The following day, the Muslims were prepared for the attack and constantly attacked the army advancing through the orchards outside Damascus. The defenders had sought help from [[Saif ad-Din Ghazi I]] of [[Mosul]] and Nur ad-Din of [[Aleppo]], who personally led an attack on the crusader camp. The crusaders were pushed back from the walls into the orchards, leaving them exposed to ambushes and guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}}\n\nAccording to [[William of Tyre]], on 27 July the crusaders decided to move to the plain on the eastern side of the city, which was less heavily fortified but had much less food and water.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} It was recorded by some that Unur had bribed the leaders to move to a less defensible position, and that Unur had promised to break off his alliance with Nur ad-Din if the crusaders went home.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} Meanwhile, Nur ad-Din and Saif ad-Din had arrived. With Nur ad-Din in the field it was impossible for the Crusaders to return to their better position.{{sfn|Brundage|1962|pp= 115\u2013121}} The local crusader lords refused to carry on with the siege, and the three kings had no choice but to abandon the city.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p= 50}} First Conrad, then the rest of the army, decided to retreat to Jerusalem on 28 July, though for their entire retreat they were followed by [[Seljuqids|Turkish]] archers who constantly harassed them.{{sfn|Baldwin|Setton|1969|p= 510}}\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Byzantium1173.JPG|thumb|left|266px|The Mediterranean world after the Second Crusade in 1173|alt=Map showing the countries surrounding the Mediterranean Sea.

This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land. After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 77}}\n\nBack in Europe, [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] was humiliated by the defeat. Bernard considered it his duty to send an apology to the Pope and it is inserted in the second part of his ''Book of Consideration''. There he explains how the sins of the crusaders were the cause of their misfortune and failures. When his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}} He would die in 1153.{{sfn|Runciman|1952|pp=232\u2013234, 277}}\n\nThe cultural impact of the Second Crusade was even greater in France, with many [[troubadour]]s fascinated by the alleged affair between Eleanor and Raymond, which helped to feed the theme of courtly love. Unlike Conrad, the image of Louis was improved by the Crusade with many of the French seeing him as a suffering pilgrim king who quietly bore God's punishments.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81\u201384}}\n\n[[File:Saladin's Conquest (1174-1189).jpg|thumb|right|320px|Map of [[Saladin]]'s Conquest into [[the Levant]]]]\n\nRelations between the Eastern Roman Empire and the French were badly damaged by the Crusade. Louis and other French leaders openly accused the Emperor Manuel I of colluding with Turkish attacks on them during the march across Asia Minor. The memory of the Second Crusade was to color French views of the Byzantines for the rest of the 12th and 13th centuries. Within the empire itself, the crusade was remembered as a triumph of diplomacy.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}} In the eulogy for the Emperor Manuel by Archbishop [[Eustathius of Thessalonica]], it was declared:\n\n<blockquote>He was able to deal with his enemies with enviable skill, playing off one against the other with the aim of bringing peace and tranquility{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|p= 84}}</blockquote>\n\nThe preliminary Wendish Crusade achieved mixed results. While the Saxons affirmed their possession of Wagria and Polabia, pagans retained control of the Obodrite land east of L\u00fcbeck. The Saxons also received tribute from Chief Niklot, enabled the colonization of the [[Bishopric of Havelberg]], and freed some [[Danes|Danish]] prisoners. However, the disparate Christian leaders regarded their counterparts with suspicion and accused each other of sabotaging the campaign. In Iberia, the campaigns in Spain, along with the siege of Lisbon, were some of the few lasting Christian victories of the Second Crusade. They are seen as pivotal battles of the wider Reconquista, which would be completed in 1492.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=126}}\n\nIn the East the situation was much darker for the Christians. In the Holy Land, the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem. In 1149, the ''atabeg'' Anur died, at which point the amir Abu Sa'id Mujir al-Din Abaq Ibn Muhammad finally began to rule. The ''ra'is'' of Damascus and commander of the ''ahdath'' military Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ''ahdath'' had played a major role in defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}} The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 81}} Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.{{sfn|Nicolle|2009|pp= 78}}\n\nBaldwin III finally [[Siege of Ascalon|seized Ascalon]] in 1153, which brought [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] into the sphere of conflict. Jerusalem was able to make further advances into Egypt, briefly occupying [[Cairo]] in the 1160s.{{sfn|Riley-Smith|1991|p=56}} However, relations with the Byzantine Empire were mixed, and reinforcements from Europe were sparse after the disaster of the Second Crusade. King [[Amalric I of Jerusalem]] allied with the Byzantines and participated in a combined invasion of Egypt in 1169, but the expedition ultimately failed. In 1171, [[Saladin]], nephew of one of Nur ad-Din's generals, was proclaimed Sultan of Egypt, uniting [[Lower Egypt|Egypt]] and [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and completely surrounding the crusader kingdom. Meanwhile, the Byzantine alliance ended with the death of emperor [[Manuel I Komnenos|Manuel I]] in 1180, and in 1187, [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|Jerusalem capitulated]] to Saladin.

She later studied the art of dance and choreography at Virginia Commonwealth University. In 2002 she decided to move forward from her study of dance to pursue her passion of music, while also incorporating her talent as a dancer; with her fellow peers, she went on to produce several musical video productions.  \n\nThe album cover for her EP ''The Chemist Said It Would Be Alright But I\u2019ve Never Been The Same,'' was designed by [[outsider artist]] [[Wes Freed]]. ''Another Song About the Darkness'', from her album ''[[Choreography (Lauren Hoffman album)|Choreography]]'', is included on [[The Sound the Hare Heard]] album. A number of Hoffman's songs were played in the groundbreaking LGBT series [[South of Nowhere]], including ''Ghost You Know'', ''Magic Stick'', ''Hope You Don't Mind'', ''Reasons to Fall'' and ''Broken''. Her song ''Rock Star'' appears on the soundtrack of the 1998 motion picture, ''[[Palmetto (film)|Palmetto]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.forlauren.com ForLauren.com]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hoffman, Lauren}}\n[[Category:1977 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American folk singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox musical artist\n| name             = Lauren Hoffman\n| image            = \n| caption          = \n| background       = solo_singer\n| birth_date       = {{birth year and age|1977}}\n| death_date       = \n| origin           = [[Charlottesville, Virginia]], [[U.S.]]\n| instrument       = [[Vocals]], [[Piano]], [[Synth]], [[Synth]], [[Bass (guitar)|Bass]], [[Tambourine]], [[Guitar]]\n| genre            = [[Acoustic music|Acoustic]]<br/>[[Folk music|Folk]]<br/>[[Alternative rock]]<br/>[[Lo-fi music|Lo-fi]]<br/>[[Pop music|Pop]]<br/>[[Independent music|Indie]]\n| occupation       = [[Singer-Songwriter]]\n| years_active     = \n| label            = [[Virgin Records]]<br/>{{Interlanguage link|Fargo Records|fr||WD=}}<br/>[[Slow River Records]]<br/>[[PIAS Recordings]]<br/>[[Kill Rock Stars]]<br/>Free Union Records<br/>Dreamy Records<br/>Pitch-a-Tent Records\n| website          = {{URL|http://www.forlauren.com/}}\n| associated_acts  = [[Mirabai]]<br/>[[Lilith Fair]]\n| current_members  = \n| past_members     = \n}}\n\n'''Lauren Hoffman''' is an American [[singer-songwriter]].

In 2002 she decided to continue to pursue her passion of music, while being able to incorporating her talent as a dancer; with her fellow peers, she went on to prodice several musical video productions.  \n\nThe album cover for her EP ''The Chemist Said It Would Be Alright But I\u2019ve Never Been The Same,'' was designed by [[outsider artist]] [[Wes Freed]]. ''Another Song About the Darkness'', from her album ''[[Choreography (Lauren Hoffman album)|Choreography]]'', is included on [[The Sound the Hare Heard]] album. A number of Hoffman's songs were played in the groundbreaking LGBT series [[South of Nowhere]], including ''Ghost You Know'', ''Magic Stick'', ''Hope You Don't Mind'', ''Reasons to Fall'' and ''Broken''. Her song ''Rock Star'' appears on the soundtrack of the 1998 motion picture, ''[[Palmetto (film)|Palmetto]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.forlauren.com ForLauren.com]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hoffman, Lauren}}\n[[Category:1977 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:American folk singers]]\n[[Category:21st-century American singers]]\n", "name_user": "Anon-Nyctophilia", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lauren_Hoffman"}

They feature heraldic devices and national emblems of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and recent pieces were designed to reflect the monarch's role as [[Head of the Commonwealth]].\n\nUse of regalia by monarchs in England can be traced back to when it was converted to Christianity in the Middle Ages. A permanent set of coronation regalia, once belonging to [[Edward the Confessor]], was established after he was made a saint in the 12th&nbsp;century. They were holy relics kept at [[Westminster Abbey]] \u2013 venue of coronations since 1066. Another set was used at religious feasts and [[State Openings of Parliament]]. Collectively, these objects came to be known as the Jewels of [[the Crown]]. Most of the present collection dates from around 350 years ago when [[Charles II of England|Charles&nbsp;II]] ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been sold or melted down after the monarchy was abolished in 1649 during the [[English Civil War]]. Only four original items pre-date the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]: a late 12th-century anointing spoon (the oldest object) and three early 17th-century swords. Upon the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the English Crown Jewels were adopted by British monarchs; the Scottish regalia are known today as the [[Honours of Scotland]].\n\nThe regalia contain 23,578 stones, among them [[Cullinan&nbsp;I]] ({{convert|530|carat|g|0}}), the largest clear cut diamond in the world, set in the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. It was cut from the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, the Cullinan, discovered in South Africa in 1905 and presented to [[Edward&nbsp;VII]]. On the [[Imperial State Crown]] are [[Cullinan&nbsp;II]] ({{convert|317|carat|g|0}}), the [[Stuart Sapphire]], [[St&nbsp;Edward's Sapphire]], and the [[Black Prince's Ruby]]&nbsp;\u2013 a large spinel given to [[Edward the Black Prince]] by a Spanish king in 1367. The [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond ({{convert|105|carat|g|0}}), originally from India, was forfeited to [[Queen Victoria]] and has featured on three consort crowns. A small number of historical objects at the Tower are either empty or set with glass and crystals.\n\nAt a coronation the monarch is anointed using [[Chrism|holy oil]] poured from an [[ampulla]] into the spoon, invested with robes and ornaments, and crowned with [[St&nbsp;Edward's Crown]]. Afterwards, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also usually worn at State Openings of Parliament. Wives of kings are invested with a plainer set of regalia,{{efn|Husbands of [[queens regnant]] are not crowned in the United Kingdom.<ref>Allison and Riddell, p. 451.</ref>}} and since 1831 a new crown has been made specially for each [[queen consort]]. Also regarded as [[Crown Jewels]] are state swords, trumpets, ceremonial maces, church plate, historical regalia, banqueting plate, and royal christening fonts. They are part of the [[Royal Collection]] and belong to the institution of monarchy, passing from one sovereign to the next. When not in use the Jewels are on public display in the [[Jewel House]] and Martin Tower where they are seen by 2.5&nbsp;million visitors every year.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe earliest known use of a crown in Britain was discovered by archaeologists in 1988 in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], Kent, and dates to between 200 and 150&nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]].

A [[heptarchy]] of new kingdoms began to emerge.

The monk, [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], became the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made that was usually buried with him or her upon death.<ref>Keay, pp. 13\u201318.</ref> In 9th-century Europe, gold crowns in the [[Byzantine]] tradition were replacing bronze, and gold soon became the standard material for English royal crowns.<ref name=\"royalgold\">{{cite podcast|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/resources/lecture-podcast-royal-gold-reflections-of-power|title=Royal Gold: Reflections of Power|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|author=Kathryn Jones|date=17 December 2014|access-date=14 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[\u00c6thelstan]] ascended the throne in 924 and united the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form the [[Kingdom of England]].

The monks at his burial place of [[Westminster Abbey]] claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity and they were to be used at the coronations of all future kings.<ref name=\"keay1820\"/> A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of relics drawn up by a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a [[tunicle]], [[dalmatic]], [[pallium]], and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the [[Holy Communion]] a [[chalice]] of [[onyx]] stone and a [[paten]] made of gold&nbsp;\u2013 all of which were considered precious relics.<ref>Strong, pp. 118\u2013119.</ref> Although the Abbey's claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion, and some of the regalia had probably been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact,<ref name=\"keay1820\"/> thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe.<ref>Rose, p. 13.</ref> Westminster Abbey is owned by a monarch,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11795159|title=Profile: Westminster Abbey|website=BBC News|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref> and the regalia had always been royal property \u2013 the abbots were mere custodians.

Being crowned and invested with regalia owned by a previous monarch who was also a saint reinforced the king's authority.<ref name=\"rose14\">Rose, p. 14.</ref> It was also wrongly thought to have been originally owned by [[Alfred the Great]] because an inscription on the lid of its box, translated from Latin, read: \"This is the chief crown of the two, with which were crowned Kings Alfred, Edward and others\".<ref>Holmes, p. 216.</ref> The crown would be used in many subsequent coronations until its eventual destruction 400 years later. Few descriptions survive, although one 17th-century historian noted that it was \"ancient Work with Flowers, adorn'd with Stones of somewhat a plain setting\",<ref>Holmes, p. 217.</ref> and an inventory described it as \"gold wire-work set with slight stones and two little bells\", weighing {{convert|79.5|oz|kg|order=flip}}.<ref>Twining, p. 132.</ref> It had arches and may have been decorated with [[filigree]] and [[cloisonn\u00e9]] enamels.<ref>Rose, p. 24.</ref> Also in the Royal Collection in this period was an item called a [[state crown]].

Following the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|defeat in 1282]] of the Welsh prince [[Llewelyn ap Gruffydd]] by [[Edward I of England|Edward&nbsp;I]], the Welsh regalia, including the crown of the legendary [[King Arthur]], were surrendered to England.

Edward&nbsp;II pawned his Great Crown in [[Flanders]]. Three crowns and other jewels were held by the [[Bishop of London]] and the [[Earl of Arundel]] as security for \u00a310,000 in the 1370s.<ref name=\"steane35\">Steane, p. 35.</ref> One crown was handed over to the [[Corporation of London]] in exchange for a \u00a34,000 loan in 1386. Sometimes objects were temporarily released from pawn by mayors, knights, peers, bankers, and other wealthy subjects in both England and continental Europe for the king to use at state occasions, then returned after the ceremony. Kings also distributed plate and jewels to their troops in lieu of money.<ref>Collins, p. 75.</ref>\n\nAt some point in the 14th&nbsp;century, all of the state regalia were moved to the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] at the Tower of London owing to a series of successful and attempted thefts in Westminster Abbey.{{efn|[[Thomas Frederick Tout]] gives an illuminating second-hand account of one such theft in ''[https://archive.org/details/mediaevalburglar00toutuoft A&nbsp;Medi\u00e6val Burglary]'' (1916).}} The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey.<ref>Keay, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> After a long absence, two arches topped with a [[monde]] and cross were added to new images of St&nbsp;Edward's Crown by the time of Henry&nbsp;IV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor [[Henry V of England|Henry&nbsp;V]],<ref name=\"steane35\"/> though arches did not feature on the Great Seal until 1471.<ref name=\"collins11\">Collins, p. 11.</ref> Known as a closed or [[imperial crown]], the arches and cross symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref>Dale Hoak in Hoak, \"The iconography of the crown imperial\", pp. 55, 63.</ref>\n\n===Tudor and early Stuart periods===\nThe traditions established in the medieval period continued later. By the middle of the 15th&nbsp;century, a crown was formally worn on six religious feasts every year: Christmas, [[Epiphany (holiday)|Epiphany]], Easter, Whitsun, [[All Saints' Day]], and one or both feasts of St&nbsp;Edward.<ref>Keay, pp. 27\u201328.</ref>{{efn|Edward the Confessor's feast day was 13 October and [[Edward the Martyr]]'s 18 March.}} A crown was displayed and worn at the annual [[State Opening of Parliament]],<ref>David Dean in Hoak, \"Image and ritual in the Tudor parliaments\", p. 243.</ref> and three were placed on the heads of monarchs at a coronation: St&nbsp;Edward's Crown, the state crown, and a \"rich crown\" made specially for the king or queen.<ref>Arnold, pp. 731\u2013732.</ref>\n\n[[File:Elizabeth I in coronation robes.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Coronation portrait of Elizabeth I in a gold robe trimmed with ermine and decorated with silver-coloured Tudor roses.

The best known example of this was [[Henry&nbsp;VIII's Crown]]. Its date of manufacture is unknown, but it was probably created at the beginning of the Tudor dynasty, maybe in the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry&nbsp;VII]]. The concept of hereditary state regalia was enshrined in English law when [[James I of England|James&nbsp;I]] decreed in 1605: \"Roiall and Princely ornaments and Jewells to be indyvidually and inseparably for ever hereafter annexed to the Kingdome of this Realme\".<ref name=\"keay32\"/>{{efn|For a schedule of royal jewels see John Nichols (1828), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id%3DaLUvAQAAMAAJ&pg{{=}}PA45 ''The Progresses, etc. of King James the First''], vol. 2, p. 45.}} After James died in 1625, [[Charles I of England|Charles&nbsp;I]] succeeded to the throne.

They feature heraldic devices and national emblems of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and recent pieces were designed to reflect the monarch's role as [[Head of the Commonwealth]].\n\nUse of regalia by monarchs in England can be traced back to when it was converted to Christianity in the Middle Ages. A permanent set of coronation regalia, once belonging to [[Edward the Confessor]], was established after he was made a saint in the 12th&nbsp;century. They were holy relics kept at [[Westminster Abbey]] \u2013 venue of coronations since 1066. Another set was used at religious feasts and [[State Openings of Parliament]]. Collectively, these objects came to be known as the Jewels of [[the Crown]]. Most of the present collection dates from around 350 years ago when [[Charles II of England|Charles&nbsp;II]] ascended the throne. The medieval and Tudor regalia had been sold or melted down after the monarchy was abolished in 1649 during the [[English Civil War]]. Only four original items pre-date the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]]: a late 12th-century anointing spoon (the oldest object) and three early 17th-century swords. Upon the [[Acts of Union 1707]], the English Crown Jewels were adopted by British monarchs; the Scottish regalia are known today as the [[Honours of Scotland]].\n\nThe regalia contain 23,578 stones, among them [[Cullinan&nbsp;I]] ({{convert|530|carat|g|0}}), the largest clear cut diamond in the world, set in the Sovereign's Sceptre with Cross. It was cut from the largest gem-quality rough diamond ever found, the Cullinan, discovered in South Africa in 1905 and presented to [[Edward&nbsp;VII]]. On the [[Imperial State Crown]] are [[Cullinan&nbsp;II]] ({{convert|317|carat|g|0}}), the [[Stuart Sapphire]], [[St&nbsp;Edward's Sapphire]], and the [[Black Prince's Ruby]]&nbsp;\u2013 a large spinel given to [[Edward the Black Prince]] by a Spanish king in 1367. The [[Koh-i-Noor]] diamond ({{convert|105|carat|g|0}}), originally from India, was forfeited to [[Queen Victoria]] and has featured on three consort crowns. A small number of historical objects at the Tower are either empty or set with glass and crystals.\n\nAt a coronation the monarch is anointed using [[Chrism|holy oil]] poured from an [[ampulla]] into the spoon, invested with robes and ornaments, and crowned with [[St&nbsp;Edward's Crown]]. Afterwards, it is exchanged for the lighter Imperial State Crown, which is also usually worn at State Openings of Parliament. Wives of kings are invested with a plainer set of regalia,{{efn|Husbands of [[queens regnant]] are not crowned in the United Kingdom.<ref>Allison and Riddell, p. 451.</ref>}} and since 1831 a new crown has been made specially for each [[queen consort]]. Also regarded as [[Crown Jewels]] are state swords, trumpets, ceremonial maces, church plate, historical regalia, banqueting plate, and royal christening fonts. They are part of the [[Royal Collection]] and belong to the institution of monarchy, passing from one sovereign to the next. When not in use the Jewels are on public display in the [[Jewel House]] and Martin Tower where they are seen by 2.5&nbsp;million visitors every year.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nThe earliest known use of a crown in Britain was discovered by archaeologists in 1988 in [[Deal, Kent|Deal]], Kent, and dates to between 200 and 150&nbsp;[[Before Christ|BC]].

The monk, [[Augustine of Canterbury|Augustine]], became the first [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Within two centuries, the ritual of anointing monarchs with holy oil and crowning them (initially with helmets) in a Christian ceremony had been established, and regalia took on a religious identity. There was still no permanent set of coronation regalia; each monarch generally had a new set made that was usually buried with him or her upon death.<ref>Keay, pp. 13\u201318.</ref> In 9th-century Europe, gold crowns in the [[Byzantine]] tradition were replacing bronze, and gold soon became the standard material for English royal crowns.<ref name=\"royalgold\">{{cite podcast|url=https://www.royalcollection.org.uk/resources/lecture-podcast-royal-gold-reflections-of-power|title=Royal Gold: Reflections of Power|publisher=Royal Collection Trust|author=Kathryn Jones|date=17 December 2014|access-date=14 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[\u00c6thelstan]] ascended the throne in 924 and united the various Anglo-Saxon kingdoms to form the [[Kingdom of England]].

The monks at his burial place of [[Westminster Abbey]] claimed that Edward had asked them to look after his regalia in perpetuity and they were to be used at the coronations of all future kings.<ref name=\"keay1820\"/> A note to this effect is contained in an inventory of relics drawn up by a monk at the abbey in 1450, recording a [[tunicle]], [[dalmatic]], [[pallium]], and other vestments; a gold sceptre, two rods, a gold crown, comb, and spoon; for the queen's coronation a crown and two rods; and for the [[Holy Communion]] a [[chalice]] of [[onyx]] stone and a [[paten]] made of gold&nbsp;\u2013 all of which were considered precious relics.<ref>Strong, pp. 118\u2013119.</ref> Although the Abbey's claim is likely to have been an exercise in self-promotion, and some of the regalia had probably been taken from Edward's grave when he was reinterred there, it became accepted as fact,<ref name=\"keay1820\"/> thereby establishing the first known set of hereditary coronation regalia in Europe.<ref>Rose, p. 13.</ref> Westminster Abbey is owned by a monarch,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-11795159|title=Profile: Westminster Abbey|website=BBC News|date=23 November 2010|accessdate=1 August 2018}}</ref> and the regalia had always been royal property \u2013 the abbots were mere custodians.

Few descriptions survive, although one 17th-century historian noted that it was \"ancient Work with Flowers, adorn'd with Stones of somewhat a plain setting\",<ref>Holmes, p. 217.</ref> and an inventory described it as \"gold wire-work set with slight stones and two little bells\", weighing {{convert|79.5|oz|kg|order=flip}}.<ref>Twining, p. 132.</ref> It had arches and may have been decorated with [[filigree]] and [[cloisonn\u00e9]] enamels.<ref>Rose, p. 24.</ref> Also in the Royal Collection in this period was an item called a [[state crown]].

Following the [[Conquest of Wales by Edward I|defeat in 1282]] of the Welsh prince [[Llewelyn ap Gruffydd]] by [[Edward I of England|Edward&nbsp;I]], the Welsh regalia, including the crown of the legendary [[King Arthur]], were surrendered to England.

Edward&nbsp;II pawned his Great Crown in [[Flanders]]. Three crowns and other jewels were held by the [[Bishop of London]] and the [[Earl of Arundel]] as security for \u00a310,000 in the 1370s.<ref name=\"steane35\">Steane, p. 35.</ref> One crown was handed over to the [[Corporation of London]] in exchange for a \u00a34,000 loan in 1386. Sometimes objects were temporarily released from pawn by mayors, knights, peers, bankers, and other wealthy subjects in both England and continental Europe for the king to use at state occasions, then returned after the ceremony. Kings also distributed plate and jewels to their troops in lieu of money.<ref>Collins, p. 75.</ref>\n\nAt some point in the 14th&nbsp;century, all of the state regalia were moved to the [[White Tower (Tower of London)|White Tower]] at the Tower of London owing to a series of successful and attempted thefts in Westminster Abbey.{{efn|[[Thomas Frederick Tout]] gives an illuminating second-hand account of one such theft in ''[https://archive.org/details/mediaevalburglar00toutuoft A&nbsp;Medi\u00e6val Burglary]'' (1916).}} The holy relics of the coronation regalia stayed behind intact at the Abbey.<ref>Keay, pp. 33\u201334.</ref> After a long absence, two arches topped with a [[monde]] and cross were added to new images of St&nbsp;Edward's Crown by the time of Henry&nbsp;IV and to the state crown during the reign of his successor [[Henry V of England|Henry&nbsp;V]],<ref name=\"steane35\"/> though arches did not feature on the Great Seal until 1471.<ref name=\"collins11\">Collins, p. 11.</ref> Known as a closed or [[imperial crown]], the arches and cross symbolised the king's pretensions of being an emperor of his own domain, subservient to no one but God, unlike some continental rulers who owed fealty to more powerful kings or the [[Holy Roman Emperor]].<ref>Dale Hoak in Hoak, \"The iconography of the crown imperial\", pp. 55, 63.</ref>\n\n===Tudor and early Stuart periods===\nThe traditions established in the medieval period continued later.

The best known example of this was [[Henry&nbsp;VIII's Crown]]. Its date of manufacture is unknown, but it was probably created at the beginning of the Tudor dynasty, maybe in the reign of [[Henry VII of England|Henry&nbsp;VII]]. The concept of hereditary state regalia was enshrined in English law when [[James I of England|James&nbsp;I]] decreed in 1605: \"Roiall and Princely ornaments and Jewells to be indyvidually and inseparably for ever hereafter annexed to the Kingdome of this Realme\".<ref name=\"keay32\"/>{{efn|For a schedule of royal jewels see John Nichols (1828), [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id%3DaLUvAQAAMAAJ&pg{{=}}PA45 ''The Progresses, etc. of King James the First''], vol. 2, p. 45.}} After James died in 1625, [[Charles I of England|Charles&nbsp;I]] succeeded to the throne.

Gold spurs are first known to have been used in 1189 at the coronation of Richard&nbsp;I, though it is likely they were introduced for [[Henry the Young King]] in 1170, and this element of the service was probably inspired by the initiation ceremony of knights.

Unlike the sovereign's dove, this one has folded wings and is relatively small. It was last used by Queen Elizabeth, later known as the Queen Mother, at the coronation of her husband George&nbsp;VI in 1937. For the coronation of Mary&nbsp;II, the wife and joint sovereign of William&nbsp;III, a more elaborate gold sceptre with dove was commissioned in 1689.

The [[mountain range]] is part of the Northern [[Inner Coast Ranges]], of the [[California Coast Ranges]] System.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Mayacamas Mountains are located south of the [[Mendocino Range]], west of [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], and east of [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]] in Mendocino and Lake Counties, and extend south into [[Napa County|Napa]] and [[Sonoma County|Sonoma]] Counties. The range stretches for {{convert|52|mi|km|-1|abbr=on}}<ref>{{gnis|234255|Mayacmas Mountains}}</ref> in a northwest-southeasterly direction.\n\nThe range's highest point is [[Cobb Mountain (California)|Cobb Mountain]], at {{convert|4724|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} in elevation, located in the central section.<ref>{{gnis|1658294|Cobb Mountain}}</ref> There are several other peaks over {{convert|2500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, including [[Mount Saint Helena]] and [[Hood Mountain]].  These peaks are sufficiently high to retain some snow cover in winter.\n\nSeveral [[stream]]s rise in the Mayacamas Mountains including [[Mark West Creek]], [[Sonoma Creek]], [[Calabazas Creek]], [[Arroyo Seco Creek]], [[Putah Creek]], and [[Santa Rosa Creek]].\n\n;Natural history\n\nAround ten million years ago, during pre-historic times, the mountains are thought to have been densely forested in [[Cupressus pigmaea|Mendocino Cypress (''Cupressus pigmaea'')]].\n\nThe Mayacamas Mountains currently support [[California mixed evergreen forest]] and [[California interior chaparral and woodlands]] [[habitat]]s.\n\n==Naming==\nAccording to Gudde:\n{{quote|'''Mayacmas Mountains''' [Sonoma, Lake Cos.] The mountain chain, forming the divide of the headwaters of [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] and [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], was named for the [[Indigenous peoples of California|Native American]] tribe on the west slope, probably a division of the [[Yuki tribe]]. According to Barrett (Pomo, p. 269), there was a Yukian [[Wappo]] [[village]], Maiya'kma, one mile south of present day [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]].  ''Serro de los Mallacomes'' ([[Mount Saint Helena]]) is shown on a ''dise\u00f1o'' of the [[Rancho Caymus]] grant (1836).  Later the name appears in the title and on the ''dise\u00f1os'' of the Rancho Mallacomes y Plano de Agua Caliente or Moristul [[Ranchos of California|land grant]], dated September 3, 1841, and October 11 and 14, 1843.\n\nThe present spelling is used in the [[Statute]]s of 1850 (pp. 60 f.).  Although this version was also used by the Whitney Survey, confusion persists to the present day.  The Geographic Board (Fifth Report) decided for Miyakma, but in 1941 it reversed this decision in favor of Mayacmas ('not Miyakma, Cobb Mountain Range, Malacomas, Mayacamas, nor St. Helena Range').

The [[mountain range]] is part of the Northern [[Inner Coast Ranges]], of the [[California Coast Ranges]] System.\n\n==Geography==\nThe Mayacamas Mountains are located south of the [[Mendocino Range]], west of [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], and east of [[Ukiah, California|Ukiah]] in Mendocino and Lake Counties, and extend south into [[Napa County|Napa]] and [[Sonoma County|Sonoma]] Counties. The range stretches for {{convert|52|mi|km|-1|abbr=on}}<ref>{{gnis|234255|Mayacmas Mountains}}</ref> in a northwest-southeasterly direction.\n\nThe range's highest point is [[Cobb Mountain (California)|Cobb Mountain]], at {{convert|4724|ft|m|0|abbr=on}} in elevation, located in the central section.<ref>{{gnis|1658294|Cobb Mountain}}</ref> There are several other peaks over {{convert|2500|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}, including [[Mount Saint Helena]] and [[Hood Mountain]].  These peaks are sufficiently high to retain some snow cover in winter.\n\nSeveral [[stream]]s rise in the Mayacamas Mountains including [[Mark West Creek]], [[Sonoma Creek]], [[Calabazas Creek]], [[Arroyo Seco Creek]], [[Putah Creek]], and [[Santa Rosa Creek]].\n\n;Natural history\n\nAround ten million years ago, during pre-historic times, the mountains are thought to have been densely forested in [[Cupressus pigmaea|Mendocino Cypress (''Cupressus pigmaea'')]].\n\nThe Mayacamas Mountains currently support [[California mixed evergreen forest]] and [[California interior chaparral and woodlands]] [[habitat]]s.\n\n==Naming==\nAccording to Gudde:\n{{quote|'''Mayacmas Mountains''' [Sonoma, Lake Cos.] The mountain chain, forming the divide of the headwaters of [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] and [[Clear Lake (California)|Clear Lake]], was named for the [[Indigenous peoples of California|Native American]] tribe on the west slope, probably a division of the [[Yuki tribe]]. According to Barrett (Pomo, p. 269), there was a Yukian [[Wappo]] [[village]], Maiya'kma, one mile south of present day [[Calistoga, California|Calistoga]].  ''Serro de los Mallacomes'' ([[Mount Saint Helena]]) is shown on a ''dise\u00f1o'' of the [[Rancho Caymus]] grant (1836).  Later the name appears in the title and on the ''dise\u00f1os'' of the Rancho Mallacomes y Plano de Agua Caliente or Moristul [[Ranchos of California|land grant]], dated September 3, 1841, and October 11 and 14, 1843.\n\nThe present spelling is used in the [[Statute]]s of 1850 (pp. 60 f.).  Although this version was also used by the Whitney Survey, confusion persists to the present day.  The Geographic Board (Fifth Report) decided for Miyakma, but in 1941 it reversed this decision in favor of Mayacmas ('not Miyakma, Cobb Mountain Range, Malacomas, Mayacamas, nor St. Helena Range').  The [[stream]] is still called [[Maacama Creek]].\n}}\n\nThe spelling Mayacamas is listed as an alternate name by the Board of Geographic Names.\n\n==Geothermal power==\nLocated in the Mayacamas mountain range is [[The Geysers]], the world's largest and most developed [[Geothermal electricity|geothermal]] field.

It was named ''Shaniwarwada'' from the Marathi words ''Shaniwar'' (Saturday) and ''Wada'' (a general term for any residence complex). [[Teak]] was imported from the jungles of [[Junnar]], stone was brought from the nearby quarries of [[Chinchwad]], and [[Lime (mineral)]] was brought from the lime-belts of [[Jejuri]]. Shaniwarwada was completed in 1732, at a total cost of Rs. 16,110, a very large sum at that time.\n\nThe opening ceremony was performed according to religious customs, on 22 January 1732, another Saturday chosen for being a particularly auspicious day.\n\nLater the Peshwas made several additions, including the fortification walls, with bastions and gates; court halls and other buildings; fountains and reservoirs. Currently, the perimeter fortification wall has five gateways and nine bastion towers, enclosing a garden complex with the foundations of the original buildings.\nIt is situated near the [[Mula-Mutha River]], in [[Kasba Peth, Pune|Kasba Peth]].\n\n==Fort complex==\n===Gates===\n[[File:Prasad Vaidya Shaniwarwada Gate.jpg|thumb|Shaniwar Wada palace's Delhi Gate or ''Dilli Darwaza''.]]\n[[File:Shaniwar Wada palace fountain.JPG|thumb|Shaniwar Wada palace fountain]]\n[[File:Shaniwar Wada by Kshitij.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Jharokha]]s'' at the Shaniwar wada.]]\n[[File:ShaniwarWada Hall.JPG|thumb|right|A hall in the first floor above ''dilli darwaja'' (Delhi Gate)]]\n[[File:Shaniwar Wada Gardens.jpg|alt=The Gardens of Shaniwar Wada are seen. The foundations of many structures as well as fountains are also present.|thumb|240x240px|Gardens of Shaniwarwada]]\nShaniwarwada has five gates:\n* ''Dilli Darwaza''\n:The ''Dilli Darwaza'' is the main gate of the complex, and faces north towards [[Delhi]]. [[Chhatrapati Shahu]] is said to have considered the north-facing fort a sign of Baji Rao's ambitions against the [[Mughal empire]], and suggested that the main gate should be made ''chhaatiiche, maatiche naahi!'' ([[Marathi language|Marathi]] for of the chests of brave soldiers, not made of mud).\n\n:The strongly built ''Dilli Darwaza'' gatehouse has massive doors, large enough to admit elephants outfitted with [[howdah]]s (seating canopies). To discourage elephants charging the gates, each pane of the gate has seventy-two sharp twelve-inch steel spikes arranged in a nine by eight grid, at approximately the height of the forehead of a battle-elephant. Each pane was also fortified with steel cross members, and borders were bolted with steel bolts having sharpened cone heads. The bastions flanking the gatehouse has arrow-loops and [[machicolation]] chutes through which boiling oil could be poured onto offending raiders. The right pane has a small man-sized door for usual entries and exits, too small to allow an army to enter rapidly. Shaniwar Wada was built by a contractor from Rajasthan known as 'Kumawat Kshatriya' belongs to Kumhar Sub-caste, after completing construction they were given the name 'Naik' by the Peshwa.\n\n:Even if the main gates were to be forced open, a charging army would need to turn sharply right, then sharply left, to pass through the gateway and into the central complex. This would provide a defending army with another chance to attack the incoming army, and to launch a counterattack to recapture the gateway.\n\n:As the ceremonial gate of the fort, military campaigns would set out from and be received back here, with appropriate religious ceremonies.\n\n* ''Mastani Darwaja'' (Mastani's Gate) or ''Aliibahadur Darwaja'', facing north\n:This gate was used by [[Bajirao I]]'s wife [[Mastani]] while travelling out of the palace's perimeter wall.\n\n*''Khidki Darwaja'' (Window Gate), facing east\n:The ''Khidki Darwaja'' is named for an armoured window it contains.\n\n*''Ganesh Darwaja'' ([[Ganesh]] Gate), facing south-east\n:Named for the [[Ganesh Rang Mahal]], which used to stand near this door. It could be used by ladies at the fort to visit the nearby [[Kasba Ganapati]] temple.\n\n*''Jambhul Darwaja'' or ''Narayan Darwaja'' (Narayan's Gate), facing south\n:This gate was used by concubines to enter and leave the fort. It obtained its second name after [[Narayanrao Peshwa]]'s corpse was removed from the fort for cremation through this gate.\n\n===Palaces===\nThe important buildings in the palace includes the ''Thorlya Rayancha Diwankhana'' (Marathi:The court reception hall of the eldest royal, meaning Baji Rao I), ''Naachacha Diwankhana'' (Dance Hall), and ''Juna Arsa Mahal'' (Old Mirror Hall).\n\nSince the buildings were destroyed in the fire of 1828, only descriptions of the living areas of the fort are available. All the state halls in the buildings are said to have doorways with exquisitely carved teak arches, with ornamental teardrop teak pillars shaped like ''Suru'' ([[Cupressaceae|cypress]] tree) trunks supporting the ceilings, which were covered with beautiful teak tracery, carved creepers and flowers. Exquisite glass chandeliers hung from the ceilings. The floors were made of highly polished [[marble]], arranged in a [[mosaic]] pattern and adorned with rich [[Persian rug]]s. The walls contained paintings with scenes from the [[Hindu epic]]s, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]].\n\nThe buildings are said to have been designed and constructed by well-known artisans, including [[Shivaram Krishna]], [[Devaji Sutar|Devaji]], [[Kondaji Sutar]], [[Morarji Patharwat Bhojraja]] (an inlay-work expert from [[Jaipur]]) and [[Ragho]] (a painter).\n\nIt is said that the Shaniwarwada complex was seven storeys high. On the top floor was the residence of the Peshwa which was called Meghadambari. It is said that the spire of [[J\u00f1\u0101ne\u015bvar]] temple at [[Alandi]], 17&nbsp;km away, could be seen from there.\n\n===The Fountain===\nThe complex had an impressive [[lotus (plant)|lotus]]-shaped fountain: the ''Hazari Karanje'' (Fountain of a thousand jets). It was constructed for the pleasure of the infant [[Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao]]. It was designed as a sixteen petal lotus; each petal had sixteen jets with an eighty-foot arch. It was the most complicated and intricate fountain of its time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nShrimant Anandrao Rudrajirao Dhulap-More (an admiral of Maratha navy in 18th century) who visited the Shaniwarwada in 1791 described it as \"very magnificent. A hundred dancers can dance here at a time. In one corner is a marble [[Ganapati]] statue and the palace is flanked by a fountain and a flower garden.\".\n\n==Popular Culture==\n*In 2008, Shaniwar Wada was featured on ''[[The Amazing Race Asia 3]]''. In the game show, one participant from each team of two had to find the correct [[Turban|pheta]] (turban) from among those worn by 50 men within the Wada.\n*It was featured in 2014 Marathi Historical drama\"[[Rama Madhav]]\".\n*Shaniwar Wada featured in the 2015 Hindi historical film ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]''.\n*Shaniwar Wada featured in the 2019 Hindi historical film ''[[Panipat (film)|Panipat]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Shree Chhatrapati Shahu Museum, Kolhapur|New Palace, Kolhapur]] of the [[Bhonsle]] [[Chhatrapati]]s\n*[[Laxmi Vilas Palace, Vadodara]] of the [[Gaekwad]]s\n*[[Jai Vilas Mahal|Jai Vilas Palace, Gwalior]] of the [[Scindias]]\n*[[Bhor Rajwada]] of [[Pant Sachiv]]s\n*[[Rajwada|Rajwada, Indore]] of [[Holkar]]s\n*[[Thanjavur Maratha palace]] of the [[Bhonsle]]s\n*[[List of forts in Maharashtra]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Shaniwar Wada}}\n*https://www.greatravellers.com/2019/08/top-5-places-to-visit-in-mumbai.html Top 5 Places to visit in Mumbai\n\n{{Pune topics}}\n{{Forts in Maharashtra}}\n{{Forts in India}}\n{{Coord|18|31|8.67|N|73|51|19.62|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1732]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures of the Maratha Empire]]\n[[Category:Royal residences in India]]\n[[Category:Palaces in Maharashtra]]\n[[Category:Forts in Pune district]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Pune]]\n[[Category:History of Pune]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Pune]]\n[[Category:Reportedly haunted locations in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Indian English|date=January 2019}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2019}}\n{{More citations needed|date=October 2017}}\n{{Infobox historic site\n| name = Shaniwarwada\n| image = Shaniwarwada gate.JPG\n| image_size = 280px\n| caption = Gate of the Shaniwarwada\n| location = [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]\n| built = 1732\n| architect = \n| architecture = [[Maratha Empire|Maratha imperial architecture]]\n| owner =\n*{{flag|Maratha Empire}} (1732-1818)\n*[[United Kingdom|British]] (1818-1947)\n**{{flagicon image|Flag of the British East India Company (1801).svg}} [[British East India Company]] (1818-1858)\n**{{flag|British Empire}} (1858-1947)\n*[[Government of India|Central Government]] of {{flag|India}} (1947-present)\n| locmapin = \n| map_caption = \n}}\n'''Shaniwarwada''' ([[ISO 15919|ISO]]: {{Transl|mr|\u015aaniv\u0101rav\u0101\u1e0d\u0101}}) is a historical [[fortification]] in the city of [[Pune]] in [[Maharashtra]], [[India]].

This would provide a defending army with another chance to attack the incoming army, and to launch a counterattack to recapture the gateway.\n\n:As the ceremonial gate of the fort, military campaigns would set out from and be received back here, with appropriate religious ceremonies.\n\n* ''Mastani Darwaja'' (Mastani's Gate) or ''Aliibahadur Darwaja'', facing north\n:This gate was used by [[Bajirao I]]'s wife [[Mastani]] while travelling out of the palace's perimeter wall.\n\n*''Khidki Darwaja'' (Window Gate), facing east\n:The ''Khidki Darwaja'' is named for an armoured window it contains.\n\n*''Ganesh Darwaja'' ([[Ganesh]] Gate), facing south-east\n:Named for the [[Ganesh Rang Mahal]], which used to stand near this door. It could be used by ladies at the fort to visit the nearby [[Kasba Ganapati]] temple.\n\n*''Jambhul Darwaja'' or ''Narayan Darwaja'' (Narayan's Gate), facing south\n:This gate was used by concubines to enter and leave the fort. It obtained its second name after [[Narayanrao Peshwa]]'s corpse was removed from the fort for cremation through this gate.\n\n===Palaces===\nThe important buildings in the palace includes the ''Thorlya Rayancha Diwankhana'' (Marathi:The court reception hall of the eldest royal, meaning Baji Rao I), ''Naachacha Diwankhana'' (Dance Hall), and ''Juna Arsa Mahal'' (Old Mirror Hall).\n\nSince the buildings were destroyed in the fire of 1828, only descriptions of the living areas of the fort are available. All the state halls in the buildings are said to have doorways with exquisitely carved teak arches, with ornamental teardrop teak pillars shaped like ''Suru'' ([[Cupressaceae|cypress]] tree) trunks supporting the ceilings, which were covered with beautiful teak tracery, carved creepers and flowers. Exquisite glass chandeliers hung from the ceilings. The floors were made of highly polished [[marble]], arranged in a [[mosaic]] pattern and adorned with rich [[Persian rug]]s. The walls contained paintings with scenes from the [[Hindu epic]]s, the [[Ramayana]] and the [[Mahabharata]].\n\nThe buildings are said to have been designed and constructed by well-known artisans, including [[Shivaram Krishna]], [[Devaji Sutar|Devaji]], [[Kondaji Sutar]], [[Morarji Patharwat Bhojraja]] (an inlay-work expert from [[Jaipur]]) and [[Ragho]] (a painter).\n\nIt is said that the Shaniwarwada complex was seven storeys high. On the top floor was the residence of the Peshwa which was called Meghadambari. It is said that the spire of [[J\u00f1\u0101ne\u015bvar]] temple at [[Alandi]], 17&nbsp;km away, could be seen from there.\n\n===The Fountain===\nThe complex had an impressive [[lotus (plant)|lotus]]-shaped fountain: the ''Hazari Karanje'' (Fountain of a thousand jets). It was constructed for the pleasure of the infant [[Peshwa Sawai Madhavrao]]. It was designed as a sixteen petal lotus; each petal had sixteen jets with an eighty-foot arch. It was the most complicated and intricate fountain of its time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}\n\nShrimant Anandrao Rudrajirao Dhulap-More (an admiral of Maratha navy in 18th century) who visited the Shaniwarwada in 1791 described it as \"very magnificent. A hundred dancers can dance here at a time. In one corner is a marble [[Ganapati]] statue and the palace is flanked by a fountain and a flower garden.\".\n\n==Popular Culture==\n*In 2008, Shaniwar Wada was featured on ''[[The Amazing Race Asia 3]]''. In the game show, one participant from each team of two had to find the correct [[Turban|pheta]] (turban) from among those worn by 50 men within the Wada.\n*It was featured in 2014 Marathi Historical drama\"[[Rama Madhav]]\".\n*Shaniwar Wada featured in the 2015 Hindi historical film ''[[Bajirao Mastani]]''.\n*Shaniwar Wada featured in the 2019 Hindi historical film ''[[Panipat (film)|Panipat]]''.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Shree Chhatrapati Shahu Museum, Kolhapur|New Palace, Kolhapur]] of the [[Bhonsle]] [[Chhatrapati]]s\n*[[Laxmi Vilas Palace, Vadodara]] of the [[Gaekwad]]s\n*[[Jai Vilas Mahal|Jai Vilas Palace, Gwalior]] of the [[Scindias]]\n*[[Bhor Rajwada]] of [[Pant Sachiv]]s\n*[[Rajwada|Rajwada, Indore]] of [[Holkar]]s\n*[[Thanjavur Maratha palace]] of the [[Bhonsle]]s\n*[[List of forts in Maharashtra]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Shaniwar Wada}}\n*https://www.greatravellers.com/2019/08/top-5-places-to-visit-in-mumbai.html Top 5 Places to visit in Mumbai\n\n{{Pune topics}}\n{{Forts in Maharashtra}}\n{{Forts in India}}\n{{Coord|18|31|8.67|N|73|51|19.62|E|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures completed in 1732]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures of the Maratha Empire]]\n[[Category:Royal residences in India]]\n[[Category:Palaces in Maharashtra]]\n[[Category:Forts in Pune district]]\n[[Category:Tourist attractions in Pune]]\n[[Category:History of Pune]]\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Pune]]\n[[Category:Reportedly haunted locations in India]]\n", "name_user": "IamRohitKamal", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eHistory)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaniwar_Wada"}
