When Bosch corners the suspect, the suspect reached in his pocket and Bosch shot him dead. According to him, the suspect reached for a gun. Although cleared by the department, the family of the suspect sues Bosch in a wrongful death suit. Wanting to keep busy during the trial, Bosch gives two fellow detectives Lakers tickets to take the weekend shift. He takes a case when a doctor's ([[Scott Wilson (actor)|Scott Wilson]]) dog finds a child's bone. The finding of the bone leads to more bones and it was determined that it was a horribly-abused boy who died in 1989. During the investigation, Bosch meets rookie police officer Julia Brasher ([[Annie Wersching]]) and forms a connection with her. While in the morgue investigating the bones, the coroner details the abuse of the child and Bosch gets flashbacks of when he was abused as a child.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Chapter Two: Lost Light\n |DirectedBy = [[Kevin Dowling (director)|Kevin Dowling]]\n |WrittenBy = Tom Smuts & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = A patrol unit pulls over a van after finding the plates belong to another vehicle and officers discover a man's naked body in the back.  Meanwhile, Detectives Bosch and Edgar continue the investigation of the dead child by re-interviewing  neighborhood man Nicholas Trent ([[Rob Brownstein]]) who neglected to mention a previous conviction for pedophilia. Some children's items are found in a bin in Trent's home, which he explains away as part of his job as a set designer for movies.  After attaining Trent's consent to take a polygraph, the detectives leave but are accosted by a reporter who has been following Bosch. The reporter uses the threat of printing speculation to wrest a comment from Bosch. Bosch supplies, and records, a comment that a routine canvass of the neighborhood has been conducted, during which everyone interviewed has been cooperative, and no suspect has yet been identified. At his civil trial, Bosch is ambushed by accusations that he murdered his suspect because his own mother was a prostitute. Brasher spends the night with Bosch and over breakfast the next morning shows Bosch an online news article identifying Trent as a pedophile and naming him as a suspect in the child murder. Back at the county jail, the driver of the van, identified as Raynard Waits ([[Jason Gedrick]]), seeks a deal to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty and revealing the locations of all the victims, including the child in Bosch's case.  Lieutenant Billets ([[Amy Aquino]]) tells Deputy Chief Irving ([[Lance Reddick]]) that Bosch believes his confidential personnel file was leaked to the attorney in the case against him by a Captain with a grudge against Bosch. Bosch receives a call from Trent's attorney, who thinks Trent is in police custody. After assuring the attorney that Trent is not in custody, Bosch and Edgar return to Trent's home and find that Trent has committed suicide by hanging.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Chapter Three: Blue Religion\n |DirectedBy = Kevin Dowling\n |WrittenBy = [[Diane Frolov]] & [[Andrew Schneider]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = After viewing the scene Bosch and the journalist following him exchange words outside of Trent's house, with both accusing the other of being the reason for Trent's death. Bosch later goes to Brasher's apartment and attempts to warn her that her own maverick ways will get her fired, which leads to an argument where Bosch is told to leave. Deputy Chief Irving tries to get Bosch and Edgar to declare Trent murdered the boy in the hill but Bosch remains unconvinced, which further angers Captain Pounds. A tip from Sheila Delacroix, a woman with a missing brother, finally leads Bosch and Edgar to conclude the body is Arthur Delacroix, a runaway from a troubled home. District Attorney and political climber Rick O'Shea ([[Steven Culp]]) informs Bosch that Waits has confessed to Delacroix's murder and orders Bosch to confirm the story. Over drinks with DC Irving, Bosch is informed this may be a purely political maneuver by the DA in a run for mayor. Bosch apologizes to Brasher and they sleep together again. At the county jail, Waits reveals specific details of contents from Delacroix's backpack that only the police knew.

Bosch quietly talks to Pierce and convinces him that Waits is too much of a bad man to let him walk and promises to make sure Pierce gets a more by-the-book partner. Bosch and Edgar visit Delacroix's estranged mother ([[Mary Page Keller]]) and get definite confirmation the body is Arthur Delacroix. Bosch's trial is concluded and the jury finds for the plaintiff; however, the jury only fines Bosch one dollar. While the LAPD and his lawyer are pleased, Bosch is angered by the jury's decision. DC Irving orders Bosch to oversee a field trip where Waits will show the police and the DA where he killed his victims. O'Shea brings a camera crew to show off his leadership abilities. During the trip Waits taunts Bosch in the car and later purposely falls breaking his nose causing O'Shea to demand Waits be un-cuffed over Bosch's strenuous objections. Waits uses the opportunity to escape by stealing Detective Moore's gun and shooting Moore and a Deputy DA who O'Shea uses as a shield.

Bosch informs Waits he can rot in a cell, kill himself, or let the police kill him. Bosch tells Sam Delacroix it was impossible for him to kill Arthur because as a drunk he was physically unable to bury the body where it was found. Bosch reveals he knows Sam raped Sheila and Sheila must have taken out her pain on Arthur. Since Bosch can't arrest Sam he uses this to demand Sam to identify any of Arthur's old friends so he can get new leads. Brasher helps Bosch find a present for his teenage daughter until he receives another call from Waits. Waits taunts Bosch leading Bosch to another murder scene at a hardware store. Bosch heads to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife Eleanor Wish ([[Sarah Clarke]]) and his daughter Maddie ([[Madison Lintz]]) for Christmas, but also wants Eleanor's skills as a former FBI profiler to get her opinion on Waits. While initially unwilling to help, Eleanor reviews the Waits case and concludes the name Raynard Waits comes from a French fairy tale and the items stolen from the hardware store were for a lair. Irving informs DA O'Shea he has the video of the Waits field trip and makes a tentative alliance to assure O'Shea becomes mayor and Irving becomes Chief. While in Las Vegas, Bosch is informed of a potential lead in the Delacroix case involving Johnny Stokes ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), and Bosch immediately returns to Los Angeles. While pursuing Stokes, Officer Brasher is shot in the ribs (although protected by her bullet-resistant vest) and she claims Stokes did it in a struggle. Bosch is certain he saw Brasher accidentally shoot herself, which if true would be the final mark on her record to fire her.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 7\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 7\n |Title = Chapter Seven: Lost Boys\n |DirectedBy = [[Alex Zakrzewski]]\n |WrittenBy = Joe Gonzalez & Eric Overmyer\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = Bosch interviews Stokes about Delacroix, but only comes away more convinced that Stokes didn't shoot Brasher. Visiting Lieutenant Billets at her home for advice on Brasher's shooting leaves Bosch convinced he has to tell the truth no matter the consequences. Bosch revisits Brasher to tell her he knows the truth about the shooting, and Brasher calls Bosch a hypocrite. Bosch has Stokes released to spare the LAPD potential embarrassment. Waits attempts to pick up a man on the highway only to fail to kill him, which leads DC Irving to assign Bosch to find Waits independent of Captain Pounds' task force. Bosch searches Waits' last known address and finds evidence of Waits' obsession with old Parisian catacombs and skulls, which leads Eleanor to speculate that Waits may be building an underground monument of his own. After Edgar reviews footage of a conversation with Waits, Bosch realizes he and Waits were both in the same orphanage giving Bosch his first lead on Waits' real identity.

A county coroner admits to Bosch that Waits called him from jail and tricked him into giving up information about what was in Delacroix's backpack, which eventually led to Waits' escape. Brasher is reassigned to Bosch's precinct to both of their disappointment. A new lead in the Delacroix case suggests Trent really did kill the boy but on further review convinces Bosch that Stokes actually killed Delacroix for his skateboard. A murder of a prostitute is very similar to his own mother's murder, which draws Bosch back into the Waits case.

Meanwhile, Detectives Bosch and Edgar continue the investigation of the dead child by re-interviewing  neighborhood man Nicholas Trent ([[Rob Brownstein]]) who neglected to mention a previous conviction for pedophilia. Some children's items are found in a bin in Trent's home, which he explains away as part of his job as a set designer for movies.  After attaining Trent's consent to take a polygraph, the detectives leave but are accosted by a reporter who has been following Bosch. The reporter uses the threat of printing speculation to wrest a comment from Bosch. Bosch supplies, and records, a comment that a routine canvass of the neighborhood has been conducted, during which everyone interviewed has been cooperative, and no suspect has yet been identified. At his civil trial, Bosch is ambushed by accusations that he murdered his suspect because his own mother was a prostitute. Brasher spends the night with Bosch and over breakfast the next morning shows Bosch an online news article identifying Trent as a pedophile and naming him as a suspect in the child murder. Back at the county jail, the driver of the van, identified as Raynard Waits ([[Jason Gedrick]]), seeks a deal to avoid the death penalty by pleading guilty and revealing the locations of all the victims, including the child in Bosch's case.  Lieutenant Billets ([[Amy Aquino]]) tells Deputy Chief Irving ([[Lance Reddick]]) that Bosch believes his confidential personnel file was leaked to the attorney in the case against him by a Captain with a grudge against Bosch. Bosch receives a call from Trent's attorney, who thinks Trent is in police custody. After assuring the attorney that Trent is not in custody, Bosch and Edgar return to Trent's home and find that Trent has committed suicide by hanging.\n |LineColor = EE714F\n}}\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber = 3\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 3\n |Title = Chapter Three: Blue Religion\n |DirectedBy = Kevin Dowling\n |WrittenBy = [[Diane Frolov]] & [[Andrew Schneider]]\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2015|2|13}}\n |ShortSummary = After viewing the scene Bosch and the journalist following him exchange words outside of Trent's house, with both accusing the other of being the reason for Trent's death. Bosch later goes to Brasher's apartment and attempts to warn her that her own maverick ways will get her fired, which leads to an argument where Bosch is told to leave. Deputy Chief Irving tries to get Bosch and Edgar to declare Trent murdered the boy in the hill but Bosch remains unconvinced, which further angers Captain Pounds. A tip from Sheila Delacroix, a woman with a missing brother, finally leads Bosch and Edgar to conclude the body is Arthur Delacroix, a runaway from a troubled home. District Attorney and political climber Rick O'Shea ([[Steven Culp]]) informs Bosch that Waits has confessed to Delacroix's murder and orders Bosch to confirm the story. Over drinks with DC Irving, Bosch is informed this may be a purely political maneuver by the DA in a run for mayor. Bosch apologizes to Brasher and they sleep together again. At the county jail, Waits reveals specific details of contents from Delacroix's backpack that only the police knew.

Bosch and Edgar visit Delacroix's estranged mother ([[Mary Page Keller]]) and get definite confirmation the body is Arthur Delacroix. Bosch's trial is concluded and the jury finds for the plaintiff; however, the jury only fines Bosch one dollar. While the LAPD and his lawyer are pleased, Bosch is angered by the jury's decision. DC Irving orders Bosch to oversee a field trip where Waits will show the police and the DA where he killed his victims. O'Shea brings a camera crew to show off his leadership abilities. During the trip Waits taunts Bosch in the car and later purposely falls breaking his nose causing O'Shea to demand Waits be un-cuffed over Bosch's strenuous objections. Waits uses the opportunity to escape by stealing Detective Moore's gun and shooting Moore and a Deputy DA who O'Shea uses as a shield. O'Shea confiscates the video from the cameraman and provides DC Irving with a copy.

Bosch informs Waits he can rot in a cell, kill himself, or let the police kill him. Bosch tells Sam Delacroix it was impossible for him to kill Arthur because as a drunk he was physically unable to bury the body where it was found. Bosch reveals he knows Sam raped Sheila and Sheila must have taken out her pain on Arthur. Since Bosch can't arrest Sam he uses this to demand Sam to identify any of Arthur's old friends so he can get new leads. Brasher helps Bosch find a present for his teenage daughter until he receives another call from Waits. Waits taunts Bosch leading Bosch to another murder scene at a hardware store. Bosch heads to Las Vegas to visit his ex-wife Eleanor Wish ([[Sarah Clarke]]) and his daughter Maddie ([[Madison Lintz]]) for Christmas, but also wants Eleanor's skills as a former FBI profiler to get her opinion on Waits. While initially unwilling to help, Eleanor reviews the Waits case and concludes the name Raynard Waits comes from a French fairy tale and the items stolen from the hardware store were for a lair. Irving informs DA O'Shea he has the video of the Waits field trip and makes a tentative alliance to assure O'Shea becomes mayor and Irving becomes Chief. While in Las Vegas, Bosch is informed of a potential lead in the Delacroix case involving Johnny Stokes ([[Shawn Hatosy]]), and Bosch immediately returns to Los Angeles. While pursuing Stokes, Officer Brasher is shot in the ribs (although protected by her bullet-resistant vest) and she claims Stokes did it in a struggle.

Visiting Lieutenant Billets at her home for advice on Brasher's shooting leaves Bosch convinced he has to tell the truth no matter the consequences. Bosch revisits Brasher to tell her he knows the truth about the shooting, and Brasher calls Bosch a hypocrite. Bosch has Stokes released to spare the LAPD potential embarrassment. Waits attempts to pick up a man on the highway only to fail to kill him, which leads DC Irving to assign Bosch to find Waits independent of Captain Pounds' task force. Bosch searches Waits' last known address and finds evidence of Waits' obsession with old Parisian catacombs and skulls, which leads Eleanor to speculate that Waits may be building an underground monument of his own.

A county coroner admits to Bosch that Waits called him from jail and tricked him into giving up information about what was in Delacroix's backpack, which eventually led to Waits' escape. Brasher is reassigned to Bosch's precinct to both of their disappointment. A new lead in the Delacroix case suggests Trent really did kill the boy but on further review convinces Bosch that Stokes actually killed Delacroix for his skateboard. A murder of a prostitute is very similar to his own mother's murder, which draws Bosch back into the Waits case.

In later years, the city operated some routes, but in 1921 assumed control over all routes and formed the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] to operate them. During this period, streetcars provided the bulk of the service. In 1954, the TTC adopted its present name, opened the first subway line, and greatly expanded its service area to cover the newly formed municipality of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] (which eventually [[Amalgamation of Toronto|amalgamated into the present City of Toronto]]). The system has evolved to feature a wide network of surface routes with the subway lines as the backbone. On February 17, 2008, the TTC made many service improvements, reversing more than a decade of service reductions and only minor improvements.<ref name=\"Sick Transit\">{{cite news |last=Lakey |first=Jack |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2008/03/08/sick_transit_ttc_dirty_leaky_decaying.html |title=Sick transit: TTC dirty, leaky, decaying |date=March 8, 2008 |work=Toronto Star |access-date=December 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to buses, streetcars, and subways, the TTC also operated the [[Toronto Island ferries|Toronto Island ferry service]] from 1927 to 1962, when it was transferred to the Metro Parks and Culture department (now [[Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division|Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation]]). The TTC also operated a suburban and regional intercity bus operator, [[Gray Coach]] Lines, from 1927 to 1990. Gray Coach used interurban coaches to link Toronto to points throughout southern Ontario. In addition, Gray Coach operated tour buses in association with [[Gray Line Worldwide|Gray Line Tours]]. The main terminal was the [[Toronto Coach Terminal|Metropolitan Toronto Bus Terminal]] on Elizabeth Street north of Dundas Street, downtown. In 1954, Gray Coach expanded further when it acquired suburban routes from independent bus operators not merged with the TTC as it expanded to cover Metro Toronto. By the 1980s, Gray Coach faced fierce competition in the interurban service in the GTA. The TTC sold Gray Coach Lines in 1990 to [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach Holdings]], which split the operation between [[Greyhound Canada]] and the government of Ontario three years later.\n[[File:The Red Rocket (1).jpg|thumb|The TTC's slogan, \"Ride the Rocket,\" originates from the red-painted [[G series (Toronto subway)|G-series]] trains that were in service from 1954 to 1990.]]\nThe [[G series (Toronto subway)|Gloucester subway cars]], the first version of TTC subway cars, known as \"red rockets\" because of their bright red exterior, have been retired.

Through the [[Great Depression]] and [[World War II]], it accumulated reserves that allowed it to expand considerably after the war, both with subways and major steady growth of its bus services into the suburbs. It was not until 1971 that the [[Metropolitan Toronto|Metro Toronto government]] and the province started to provide operational subsidies, required primarily due to rising costs of delivering transit to low-density suburbs in Metro Toronto and large wage increases.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Deficits and subsidies soared throughout the 1970s and 1980s,<ref>TTC annual reports</ref> followed by service cuts and a period of ridership decline in the 1990s, partly attributable to recession.\n\nIn 1997, the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario|Progressive Conservative]] government under Premier [[Mike Harris]] implemented the \"[[Common Sense Revolution]]\" which, among other things, cut {{CAD|42{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} in provincial financing support for the [[Eglinton West line|Eglinton West subway line]], and cut $718{{nbsp}}million in municipal transit support, placing the entire burden of financing the system on municipalities and leaving the TTC with a $95.8{{nbsp}}million/year funding shortfall.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.cielap.org/pdf/csr4.pdf |title=Ontario's Environment and the Common Sense Revolution: A Four Year Report |last=Winfield |first=Mark |date=September 1999 |website=Canadian Institute for Environmental Law and Policy |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190415051025/http://www.cielap.org/pdf/csr4.pdf |archive-date=April 15, 2019}}</ref> The TTC cut back service with a significant curtailment put into effect on February 18, 1996.

Buses began to operate in the city in 1921, and became necessary for areas without streetcar service. After an earlier experiment in the 1920s, [[Trolleybus|trolley buses]] were used on a number of routes starting in 1947, but all trolley bus routes were converted to bus operation between 1991 and 1993. The TTC always used the term \"trolley coach\" to refer to its trackless electric vehicles. Hundreds of old buses have been replaced with the low-floor Orion VII, and the TTC has acquired many [[hybrid electric bus]]es.

The three subway lines share [[non-revenue track]] connections and use the same technology. The two versions of subway trains in use today are the new [[Toronto Rocket]]s on Lines 1 and 4 and the [[T series (Toronto subway)|T1s]] on Line 2. Line 3 Scarborough has a fleet of 28 [[S series (Toronto subway)|S-series]] cars grouped into trains of four cars each, and is not compatible with other subway lines, given that the S-series cars use standard gauge. It shares no track connections or equipment.\n\nAll subway lines provide service seven days a week from approximately 5:45&nbsp;a.m. to 1:30&nbsp;a.m. (the following day) (last train runs at approximately 1:45 in each direction) except for Sundays, in which the opening is delayed until approximately 8:00&nbsp;a.m. During the overnight periods, the subway and its stations are closed to perform maintenance at track level and in the stations themselves. Overnight service is provided by buses and streetcars operating above ground. These overnight routes are issued numbers in the 300 series and are referred to as [[Blue Night Network|Blue Night]] routes, indicated by a typical TTC bus stop sign with a blue band added.\n\n===Streetcars===\n[[File:New Flexity LR vehicles approach Spadina and King, 2016 07 21 (16).JPG - panoramio.jpg|thumb|An [[Articulated Light Rail Vehicle|ALRV]] (left) and [[Flexity Outlook (Toronto streetcar)|Flexity Outlook]] (right)]]\n{{Main|Toronto streetcar system}}\nToronto's streetcar system is one of the few in North America still operating along street-running tracks. It has been operating since the mid-19th century. [[Horsecar]] service started in 1861, and 600 V DC overhead electric service began in 1892. New TTC routes since the 1940s have generally been operated by other modes of transportation, and the less busy streetcar routes have also been converted. Streetcar routes are now focused on the downtown area, with none running farther north than [[St. Clair Avenue]], {{convert|6|km}} from [[Lake Ontario]].\n\nUp until 1995, the TTC operated a fleet of 765 [[Presidents' Conference Committee (Toronto streetcar)|PCC-type streetcars]], 540 of which it purchased new.

However, by law, other local transit agencies are prohibited from carrying passengers wholly within the City of Toronto. Therefore, YRT and MiWay buses can only drop off passengers inbound and pick up passengers outbound while within the boundaries of Toronto.

The TTC system is one of the few mass transit systems in Canada where many surface routes can be accessed inside a paid-fare zone common to other routes or subway lines. This feature allows boarding via the back doors at terminals, reduces the usage of paper transfers, and the need of operators to check for proof-of-payment. However, if people are caught entering fare-paid terminals illegally from the street, they could be fined $500 for fare evasion.\n\n[[File:TTC Bus Stop.jpg|thumb|upright|A TTC bus stop pole]]\nThe shelters in the system are installed and maintained under contracts with [[Astral Media]] (now owned by [[Bell Media]]) (with [[Outfront Media|CBS Outdoor]] since 2006 and previously [[Viacom (1952\u20132006)|Viacom]] Media) and [[Toronto Transportation Services]].<ref>{{cite web |last=Lakey |first=Jack |url=https://www.thestar.com/yourtoronto/the_fixer/2013/01/17/the_fixer_say_goodbye_to_onesided_transit_shelters.html |title=The Fixer: Say goodbye to one-sided transit shelters |work=Toronto Star |date=January 17, 2013 |access-date=December 27, 2014}}</ref> Approximately 4,100 shelters are managed by Toronto Transportation.

During the phase out of the Special Constables, the Toronto Police reinstated its Transit Patrol Unit, which had been cancelled in the mid-1990s. The Special Constables were replaced by [[bylaw enforcement officer]]s known as Transit Enforcement Officers, as part of the TTC's Transit Enforcement Unit.\n\nThe negotiation between TTC and the Toronto Police Services Board took place in 2013 resulting in restored Special Constable Status and Peace Officer Authority.\n\n====Bylaws enforced====\nThe TTC's By-law No. 1 is a [[by-law]] governing the actions of passengers and employees while on Commission property. It can be enforced by a \"proper authority\" which is defined in the by-law as: \"an employee or agent of the TTC wearing a TTC uniform; an employee or agent of the TTC carrying an identification card issued by the TTC; or a municipal police officer.\"<ref name=\":1\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ttc.ca/Riding_the_TTC/TTC_Bylaws/index.jsp |title=TTC By-law No. 1 |publisher=Toronto Transit Commission |date=December 7, 1990 |access-date=December 27, 2014}}</ref> The by-law covers rules regarding fare payment and conduct while in the system. Effective October 12, 2009, a revised version of the by-law has been issued. Revisions include the restriction of placing feet or \"any object that may soil\" on seats, the prohibition against using offensive language (including via the user-generated displays at [[Pioneer Village station]], which are part of the public art installation ''LightSpell'', although the displays have not yet been activated),<ref name=\"LightSpell-2017-12-22\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2017/12/22/ttc-backtracks-on-500000-station-art-installation.html |title=TTC backtracks on $500,000 station art installation |newspaper=[[Toronto Star]] |first=Ainslie |last=Cruickshank |date=December 22, 2017 |access-date=December 22, 2017}}</ref> and the provision that one must give up their seat to a person with a disability or pregnancy in priority seating areas.\n\n===Communications===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}\nThe TTC uses three primary voice and data communication systems. The first is the system used by Operations, Security and Maintenance. This system operates on five [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] conventional frequencies. Channels 1, 3, 4 and 5 are used for day-to-day operations, while Channel 2 is reserved for the [[Wheel-Trans]] service.\n\nThe second system, the Communications and Information System (CIS), is used by buses and streetcars, and employs transmission facilities throughout the city. Conceived in the late 1970s and fully implemented in 1991, it consists of a computer unit on board each bus and streetcar, called the Transit Radio Unified Microprocessor (TRUMP). This is attached to a [[transponder]] receiver, which allows CIS operators to [[automatic vehicle location|track the location of the vehicle]] using a computational system known as [[dead reckoning]]. The TRUMP unit also allows vehicle and CIS operators to send and receive [[text messaging|text messages]] for such things as [[short turn]]s and [[detour|route adjustments]]. There is also the option of voice-based communication between the vehicle and CIS operators. With the introduction of [[NextBus]] technology to provide real-time arrival information, the CIS has been updated to use a combination of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] data and the previous dead reckoning ([[signpost]]-based) system. In the event that internally managed TTC communications are unavailable, the TRUMP unit operates on [[Bell Mobility]]'s [[Code-division multiple access|CDMA]] network to communicate with divisional operations and transit control.\n\n<!--Irrelevant and overly technical details that follow have been removed:\nEach TRUMP unit on every streetcar and bus is equipped with a silent \"yellow alarm\" key which can be activated by the operator in the event of an emergency on board. When activated, CIS supervisors and transit control dispatchers are able to hear what is going on via a high-quality boom microphone located in front of the steering wheel and dispatch emergency responders. There is also a \"red alarm\" key, which enables one way communication with CIS once pressed. This can be used in events such as fires when immediate assistance is required and two-way voice communication would prove detrimental to safety.-->\nIn 2012, the TTC began research into transitioning from the outdated and antiquated CIS to a newer [[computer-aided dispatch]] (CAD) system. Utilizing this technology would help improve headways, provide more reliable communications and allow divisional supervisors to locate vehicles in real time (the current GPS system only sends location updates every 20 seconds). Implementation of the system, later named the Vehicle Information System & Integrated Operations Network (VISION), began in 2016,<ref>https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2016/January_21/Reports/Presentation_Vision_Program.pdf</ref> with the contract for associated equipment awarded to Clever Devices ULC.<ref>https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2017/February_21/Reports/6_Presentation_VISION_Program_Update.pdf</ref> After extensive testing, deployment of VISION on vehicles in revenue service began in the summer of 2018, with plans to fully equip the entire bus and streetcar fleet by 2019.<ref>https://www.ttc.ca/Coupler/PDFs/TTC%20Corporate%20Plan%202018-2022.pdf</ref>\n\nThe third system, known as the \"wayside system\", consists of UHF [[MPT-1327]] [[Trunking]] radio sets used by the three heavy-rail subway lines. They replaced older devices which communicated by the third rail, and are divided into separate systems representing their respective subway lines. This trunking system allows Transit Control to communicate directly with a single train, a zone encompassing several trains, or the entire line. (Line 3 Scarborough uses a single channel UHF system, much the same as the system used by operations staff.)\n\nAll of these systems can be monitored by a [[Radio scanner|scanner]] capable of the UHF Low band (406\u2013430&nbsp;MHz).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transittoronto.ca/spare/0018.shtml |publisher=Transit Toronto |title=TTC radio \u2013 some background information |first=John |last=Lennox |date=November 10, 2006 |access-date=July 21, 2007}}</ref> Numeric codes\u2014often referring to people or positions (299 Bloor \u2013 Subway Line mechanic at Bloor)\u2014are also announced through the radio and the overhead paging system.

The new media system replaced the old \"Subway Online\" system, which were decommissioned.\n\nThe signs feature advertising, news headlines and weather information. From its inception in 2005 until December 31, 2017, the news feed and advertising for television programs were supplied under a contract with [[Bell Media]]'s 24-hour local television news service, [[CP24]].

In later years, the city operated some routes, but in 1921 assumed control over all routes and formed the [[Toronto Transportation Commission]] to operate them. During this period, streetcars provided the bulk of the service. In 1954, the TTC adopted its present name, opened the first subway line, and greatly expanded its service area to cover the newly formed municipality of [[Metropolitan Toronto]] (which eventually [[Amalgamation of Toronto|amalgamated into the present City of Toronto]]). The system has evolved to feature a wide network of surface routes with the subway lines as the backbone. On February 17, 2008, the TTC made many service improvements, reversing more than a decade of service reductions and only minor improvements.<ref name=\"Sick Transit\">{{cite news |last=Lakey |first=Jack |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/gta/2008/03/08/sick_transit_ttc_dirty_leaky_decaying.html |title=Sick transit: TTC dirty, leaky, decaying |date=March 8, 2008 |work=Toronto Star |access-date=December 27, 2014}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to buses, streetcars, and subways, the TTC also operated the [[Toronto Island ferries|Toronto Island ferry service]] from 1927 to 1962, when it was transferred to the Metro Parks and Culture department (now [[Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation Division|Toronto Parks, Forestry and Recreation]]). The TTC also operated a suburban and regional intercity bus operator, [[Gray Coach]] Lines, from 1927 to 1990. Gray Coach used interurban coaches to link Toronto to points throughout southern Ontario. In addition, Gray Coach operated tour buses in association with [[Gray Line Worldwide|Gray Line Tours]]. The main terminal was the [[Toronto Coach Terminal|Metropolitan Toronto Bus Terminal]] on Elizabeth Street north of Dundas Street, downtown. In 1954, Gray Coach expanded further when it acquired suburban routes from independent bus operators not merged with the TTC as it expanded to cover Metro Toronto. By the 1980s, Gray Coach faced fierce competition in the interurban service in the GTA. The TTC sold Gray Coach Lines in 1990 to [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach Holdings]], which split the operation between [[Greyhound Canada]] and the government of Ontario three years later.\n[[File:The Red Rocket (1).jpg|thumb|The TTC's slogan, \"Ride the Rocket,\" originates from the red-painted [[G series (Toronto subway)|G-series]] trains that were in service from 1954 to 1990.]]\nThe [[G series (Toronto subway)|Gloucester subway cars]], the first version of TTC subway cars, known as \"red rockets\" because of their bright red exterior, have been retired.

The three subway lines share [[non-revenue track]] connections and use the same technology. The two versions of subway trains in use today are the new [[Toronto Rocket]]s on Lines 1 and 4 and the [[T series (Toronto subway)|T1s]] on Line 2. Line 3 Scarborough has a fleet of 28 [[S series (Toronto subway)|S-series]] cars grouped into trains of four cars each, and is not compatible with other subway lines, given that the S-series cars use standard gauge. It shares no track connections or equipment.\n\nAll subway lines provide service seven days a week from approximately 5:45&nbsp;a.m. to 1:30&nbsp;a.m. (the following day) (last train runs at approximately 1:45 in each direction) except for Sundays, in which the opening is delayed until approximately 8:00&nbsp;a.m. During the overnight periods, the subway and its stations are closed to perform maintenance at track level and in the stations themselves.

[[GO Transit]], [[MiWay]], [[York Region Transit]], [[Viva Rapid Transit]], [[Brampton Transit]], and [[Durham Region Transit]] are connected to the TTC via some of Toronto's subway stations, GO Transit's commuter rail stations, and other hubs like [[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]. In addition to Union Station, there are 6 other stations where the TTC subway network and GO Transit commuter rail lines intersect.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transittoronto.ca/regional/2108.shtml |website=Transit Toronto |access-date=July 5, 2017 |title=GO Train/Toronto Subway Connections Current and Proposed |last=Bow |first=James}}</ref>\n\nSome bus routes of the surrounding local transit agencies run on Toronto streets along with TTC buses, mainly to reach TTC subway stations. Examples of this include York Region Transit (YRT) and Viva buses plying Yonge Street en route to [[Finch Bus Terminal]] and MiWay buses plying various streets in Etobicoke en route to [[Islington station (Toronto)|Islington station]]. However, by law, other local transit agencies are prohibited from carrying passengers wholly within the City of Toronto. Therefore, YRT and MiWay buses can only drop off passengers inbound and pick up passengers outbound while within the boundaries of Toronto. As these systems have separate fares from the TTC, regional buses that use fare-paid TTC bus terminals at subway stations drop off passengers on-street outside the stations. Boarding is done inside the terminals, and riders pay the suburban transit fare upon entering buses.\n\n[[Via Rail]] and [[Amtrak]] connect with the TTC at [[Union Station (Toronto)|Union Station]], while [[Greyhound Canada|Greyhound]] and [[Ontario Northland Motor Coach Services|Ontario Northland]] intercity coaches also connect with the TTC at the [[Toronto Coach Terminal|Toronto Coach]], [[Scarborough Centre Bus Terminal|Scarborough Centre]], {{ttcs|Highway 407}}, and [[Yorkdale Bus Terminal|Yorkdale]] bus terminals.\n\n===Cellular and Wi-Fi connectivity===\nThe communication system used by surface vehicles is called the Communications and Information System.<ref>{{cite conference |last1=Catton |first1=F.

During the phase out of the Special Constables, the Toronto Police reinstated its Transit Patrol Unit, which had been cancelled in the mid-1990s. The Special Constables were replaced by [[bylaw enforcement officer]]s known as Transit Enforcement Officers, as part of the TTC's Transit Enforcement Unit.\n\nThe negotiation between TTC and the Toronto Police Services Board took place in 2013 resulting in restored Special Constable Status and Peace Officer Authority.\n\n====Bylaws enforced====\nThe TTC's By-law No. 1 is a [[by-law]] governing the actions of passengers and employees while on Commission property.

The first is the system used by Operations, Security and Maintenance. This system operates on five [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] conventional frequencies. Channels 1, 3, 4 and 5 are used for day-to-day operations, while Channel 2 is reserved for the [[Wheel-Trans]] service.\n\nThe second system, the Communications and Information System (CIS), is used by buses and streetcars, and employs transmission facilities throughout the city. Conceived in the late 1970s and fully implemented in 1991, it consists of a computer unit on board each bus and streetcar, called the Transit Radio Unified Microprocessor (TRUMP). This is attached to a [[transponder]] receiver, which allows CIS operators to [[automatic vehicle location|track the location of the vehicle]] using a computational system known as [[dead reckoning]]. The TRUMP unit also allows vehicle and CIS operators to send and receive [[text messaging|text messages]] for such things as [[short turn]]s and [[detour|route adjustments]]. There is also the option of voice-based communication between the vehicle and CIS operators. With the introduction of [[NextBus]] technology to provide real-time arrival information, the CIS has been updated to use a combination of [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] data and the previous dead reckoning ([[signpost]]-based) system. In the event that internally managed TTC communications are unavailable, the TRUMP unit operates on [[Bell Mobility]]'s [[Code-division multiple access|CDMA]] network to communicate with divisional operations and transit control.\n\n<!--Irrelevant and overly technical details that follow have been removed:\nEach TRUMP unit on every streetcar and bus is equipped with a silent \"yellow alarm\" key which can be activated by the operator in the event of an emergency on board. When activated, CIS supervisors and transit control dispatchers are able to hear what is going on via a high-quality boom microphone located in front of the steering wheel and dispatch emergency responders. There is also a \"red alarm\" key, which enables one way communication with CIS once pressed. This can be used in events such as fires when immediate assistance is required and two-way voice communication would prove detrimental to safety.-->\nIn 2012, the TTC began research into transitioning from the outdated and antiquated CIS to a newer [[computer-aided dispatch]] (CAD) system. Utilizing this technology would help improve headways, provide more reliable communications and allow divisional supervisors to locate vehicles in real time (the current GPS system only sends location updates every 20 seconds). Implementation of the system, later named the Vehicle Information System & Integrated Operations Network (VISION), began in 2016,<ref>https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2016/January_21/Reports/Presentation_Vision_Program.pdf</ref> with the contract for associated equipment awarded to Clever Devices ULC.<ref>https://www.ttc.ca/About_the_TTC/Commission_reports_and_information/Commission_meetings/2017/February_21/Reports/6_Presentation_VISION_Program_Update.pdf</ref> After extensive testing, deployment of VISION on vehicles in revenue service began in the summer of 2018, with plans to fully equip the entire bus and streetcar fleet by 2019.<ref>https://www.ttc.ca/Coupler/PDFs/TTC%20Corporate%20Plan%202018-2022.pdf</ref>\n\nThe third system, known as the \"wayside system\", consists of UHF [[MPT-1327]] [[Trunking]] radio sets used by the three heavy-rail subway lines. They replaced older devices which communicated by the third rail, and are divided into separate systems representing their respective subway lines. This trunking system allows Transit Control to communicate directly with a single train, a zone encompassing several trains, or the entire line. (Line 3 Scarborough uses a single channel UHF system, much the same as the system used by operations staff.)\n\nAll of these systems can be monitored by a [[Radio scanner|scanner]] capable of the UHF Low band (406\u2013430&nbsp;MHz).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://transittoronto.ca/spare/0018.shtml |publisher=Transit Toronto |title=TTC radio \u2013 some background information |first=John |last=Lennox |date=November 10, 2006 |access-date=July 21, 2007}}</ref> Numeric codes\u2014often referring to people or positions (299 Bloor \u2013 Subway Line mechanic at Bloor)\u2014are also announced through the radio and the overhead paging system.

CDCR correctional officers are sworn law enforcement officers with peace officer powers.\n\nAs of 2013, CDCR employed approximately 24,000 peace officers (state correctional officers), 1,800 state parole agents, and 200 criminal investigators/special agents.\n\n\n\n'''Secretary Ralph Diaz'''\n\nRalph Diaz was appointed by Governor Gavin Newsom as Secretary for the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation (CDCR) on March 27, 2019. Most recently, he served as Undersecretary of Operations, Deputy Director of Facility Operations, and Associate Director of High Security Institutions. Before that, Mr. Diaz served as a prison Warden, Correctional Counselor Supervisor, and Correctional Counselor, after starting his career as a Correctional Officer in 1991. \n\nMr. Diaz has the honor and privilege to lead over 60,000 of the nation\u2019s finest correctional professionals, who provide outstanding levels of rehabilitative services to the offenders in our care. \n\nWith more than 29 years of diverse correctional experience, Mr. Diaz has seen first-hand how restorative justice practices can transform communities inside and outside prison walls. He believes in a holistic approach to corrections that offers a variety of educational, vocational, and therapeutic programs to offenders while also stressing individual accountability and respecting and honoring victims of crime.\n\nMr. Diaz has been instrumental in developing policies focused on staff well-being and professional development, while empowering them to serve as role models and mentors to all.\n\n==History==\nIn 1851, California activated its first state-run institution.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]]. Cadets must complete a 12-week formal and comprehensive training program. The curriculum consists of 640 hours (four months) of training. Instruction includes but is not limited to firearms, chemical agents, non-lethal impact weapons, arrest and control techniques, state law and department policies and procedures.\n\nCadets must also successfully complete the [[Peace Officer Standards and Training]] (POST) minimum requirement course. Upon completion of the academy, cadets are sworn in as CDCR peace officers. Upon assignment to their work institution or location, these officers also undergo further training for two years as vocational apprentices (one year of which is spent on probation). Upon completion of their two-year training they are then considered regular state correctional peace officers (CDCR officers)<ref name=acad>{{cite web | url = http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | title = Correctional Officer Training | work = Department of Corrections & Rehabilitation | accessdate = April 27, 2008 | url-status = dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080416205837/http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Career_Opportunities/POR/COTraining.html | archivedate = April 16, 2008 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Fugitive Apprehension Team ===\n\nAn elite and low-profile unit within CDCR is the Fugitive Apprehension Team or FAT which is made up of just over eighty agents who are assigned to offices throughout the state. FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates. Seventeen were custody employees, and three were non-custody employees who supervised inmates working in industrial areas. Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|}}\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

These officers also monitor and supervise parolees who are released back into the general public. Other primary duties include investigation and apprehension of institutional escapees and parolees at large (PAL), prison gangs, statewide narcotics enforcement and investigations (involving institutions), etc.\n\n===Correctional Peace Officer Academy===\nCDCR Peace Officers are trained to become Sworn Peace Officers of the State of California at the Basic Correctional Peace Officer Academy located in [[Galt, California]].

FAT agents are criminal investigators and are teamed with the Warrants Unit of the United States Marshals Service (USMS) in locating and apprehending individuals wanted for high-violence offenses, whether under the jurisdiction of CDCR or local agencies. FAT agents provide services to local agencies whose resources do not allow them to pursue violent offenders who have fled their jurisdictions, to parole violators wanted for violent offenses, and individuals wanted under federal warrants. Some of the agents have powers that extend beyond the State of California as they are also sworn special deputies of the USMS. FAT agents are highly trained in high-risk warrant service execution and must complete a special academy to become members of the \"Teams.\" Members of these teams are kept low-profile for security reasons, as their nature is to conduct investigations in locating violent fugitives and executing their apprehension on a timely basis.\n\nFAT shares a sentimental affiliation with the historic California State Rangers, who were created in May 1853 by a California Legislative Act and organized by Captain Harry Love, to apprehend dangerous offenders of the time. In August 1853, after having fulfilled their purpose, the Rangers were mustered out of service. The affiliation that FAT shares, although remotely, is that in July 1996 the California State Legislature enacted specific funds earmarked via the Department of Corrections to create fugitive teams to locate and bring to justice parole violators, the most violent offenders of modern times.\n\n==Officers killed while on duty==\nAccording to the Officer Down Memorial Page Web site, since the inception of what is currently CDCR, 33 employees have been killed in the line of duty.<ref>[http://www.odmp.org/agency/499-california-department-of-corrections-and-rehabilitation-california The Officer Down Memorial Page] February 2009</ref> Of these, 20 have been killed by inmates.

Fifteen deaths were from stab wounds, two were from gunshot wounds, two were from bludgeoning, and one was from being thrown from a tier.<ref>{{cite web|last=Data Analysis Unit|title=EMPLOYEES KILLED BY INMATES January 1952 through December 2011|url=http://www.cdcr.ca.gov/Reports_Research/Offender_Information_Services_Branch/Annual/Beh5/BEH5d2011.pdf|publisher=[[CDCR]]|accessdate=March 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\n{{See also|}}\n\n\n==<big>Special Service Unit</big>==\nIn addition to correctional officers, CDCR employs a small group of special agents<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chaddock |first1=Don |title=OCS Special Agent Karen Mory shatters preconceptions |url=https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190314014927/https://www.insidecdcr.ca.gov/2018/07/ocs-special-agent-karen-mory-shatters-preconceptions/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 March 2019 |website=Inside CDCR |publisher=CDCR |accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref> (criminal investigators) who are assigned to offices throughout the state.These investigators are part of an elite unit known as the Special Service Unit or simply SSU. They have full-time peace officer powers throughout the state under Penal Code Section 803.2. SSU agents conduct criminal investigations involving parolees and inmates,  monitor prison gangs, gather intelligence and conduct narcotics enforcement.  Special agents work closely with other law enforcement agencies, such as the Federal Bureau of Investigation, California Department of Justice and local police and sheriff departments. SSU special agents hold the state equivalency of a CDCR captain.  As confidential employees, they are able to keep a low profile and small footprint while carrying out very high-profile cases.\n\nThe Special Service Unit was formed in 1964, at the request of then-California Governor Edmund Brown. Sadly, the formation of the unit is said to have evolved after the March 9, 1963 kidnapping of two Los Angeles police officers. The kidnapping and subsequent murder of one of the officers was committed by two state parolees, Gregory Powell and Jimmy Lee Smith (a.k.a., Jimmy Youngblood). LAPD officers Ian Campbell and Karl Hettinger conducted a routine traffic stop on Powell and Smith in the Hollywood area.  As the two officers approached the car, they were kidnapped at gunpoint by the two parolees and forced into Powell's car. They were driven north from Los Angeles to an onion field near Bakersfield, where Officer Campbell was fatally shot.  Officer Hettinger was able to escape.\n\nIn the police investigation that ensued after the incident, the ability of LAPD detectives to get timely and necessary information from the Department of Corrections was severely hampered, ostensibly by the size and bureaucracy of the department. Detectives needed a way to obtain information quickly and have the assistance of the CDCR resources. Because of this tragic incident and the legislative conferences afterward, a decision was made to form the Special Service Unit.\n\nCharles Casey, who was an assistant director with CDCR at the time, learned of a unit within the New York Department of Corrections that seemed to bridge the gap between New York state parole services and local law enforcement. Casey met with Russell H. Oswald, chairman of the New York State Parole Board, who was the founder of the Bureau of Special Services within the New York parole division. Based upon his study and evaluation of the Bureau of Special Services, Casey came back to California and designed a similar unit, calling it the Special Service Unit. After the legislature approved its formation, the unit officially began services in 1964.\n\nThe unit serves as the primary investigative unit for CDCR on cases that stem from the prison or state parolees and affect the street. According to its official description, SSU \"conducts the major criminal investigations and prosecutions, criminal apprehension efforts of prison escapees and parolees wanted for serious and violent felonies, is the primary departmental gang management unit, conducts complex gang-related investigations of inmates and parolees suspected of criminal gang activity, and is the administrative investigative and law enforcement liaison unit.\" In layman's terms, this means the unit does anything asked of it to keep communities safe.\n\n<gallery>\n</gallery>\n\n==High Profile Cases Involving SSU==\nThroughout its fifty-year history, the Special Service Unit has been quietly involved in numerous high-profile cases.  One such example is the Patricia Hearst kidnapping by the Symbionese Liberation Army (SLA) in 1974. The SLA was a radical left-wing organization formed in Soledad Prison by Donald DeFreeze. In 1973 Defreeze escaped from prison and was leading the SLA on the streets when they kidnapped Hearst. The day after Hearst's kidnapping, special agents from the unit's San Francisco office provided police with photographs of suspects who matched the overall description of one of the abductors. Thanks to photographs supplied by SSU, DeFreeze was positively identified as one of Hearst's abductors. That identification led to a lengthy investigation of SLA and its origin behind prison walls.\n\nAnother example is the high-profile murders that shook Los Angeles in the late sixties. The murders were committed by members of Charles Manson's cult and came to be known as Helter Skelter. During the course of the investigation into the cult, SSU special agents were requested by Los Angeles Police to interview Bruce Davis, a Manson follower who had been convicted of the 1969 Gary Hinman murder in Los Angeles. Davis was a Manson devotee whom police were trying to turn as an informant into many of the open murders linked to the Manson Family. \n\nOn January 26, 2001, San Francisco resident Diane Whipple was attacked and killed by two large Presa Canario dogs in the hallway of her apartment building. The dogs, named Bane and Hera, were owned by Whipple's neighbors, Marjorie Knoller and Robert Noel. The dogs' actual owner, Paul Schneider, was a high-ranking member of the Aryan Brotherhood prison gang who was serving a life sentence in Pelican Bay State Prison. The Special Service Unit had been investigating the Aryan Brotherhood and its illegal dog breeding business for several months prior to the death of Whipple. SSU was able to assist local law enforcement during the investigation and prosecution of Knoller and Noel.\n\nIn August 2009, Phillip Garrido was arrested in Antioch, Calif.,  for the kidnapping of Jaycee Dugard. He had kidnapped her eighteen years prior and kept her in captivity. The Hayward (Calif.) police department had interest in Garrido as it related to the 1988 kidnapping of nine-year-old Michaela Garecht.  Special agents from SSU assisted the detectives from the Hayward Police Department in the ensuing investigation. In 2011, they assisted in conducting interviews with Garrido and his wife, Nancy Garrido, who had both been sentenced to state prison in California. \n\nIn August 2014, convicted murderer Scott Landers escaped from the back of a CDCR transport van while on the Interstate 5 freeway just north of Atwater, Calif. Landers had been convicted of the stabbing of a 61-year-old man in Riverside, Calif. and was serving twenty-five years to life. Upon his escape, members of the elite Special Service Unit were called in from across the state to lead the investigation. Within twenty-four hours, the escaped murderer was caught and brought back to CDCR custody.\n\n==Current Structure of SSU==\n\nThe current configuration of the Special Service Unit remains true to its origins\u2014small and mobile. As of 2018, CDCR reports there are only thirty SSU special agents. They are based throughout California in clandestine, off-site locations. Every agent is equipped with tactical and surveillance equipment and is ready to respond anywhere within the state at a moment's notice.\n\nIn 2005, CDCR began to consolidate various divisions and units in an effort to realign its organizational structure. During that time the Office of Correctional Safety (OCS) was created, which serves as the \"special operations division\" for the department. Within the OCS are groups such as the Fugitive Apprehension Team (FAT) and the Emergency Operations Unit (EOU). SSU became a branch of OCS as well, which elevated the training and tactical acumen for all of the special agents. With the merger of the EOU unit with SSU, special agents were responsible for attaining a higher level of tactical firearms proficiency as well as tactical high-risk entry training.\n\nServing as the \"detective unit\" for the Department of Corrections, SSU special agents are responsible for keeping current on the latest investigative techniques and current case law.  Special agents often work hand-in-hand with law enforcement investigators from all branches of government, city, county and federal.  Many SSU agents are assigned to regional task forces throughout California and a handful are cross-designated as federal task force officers with such federal partners as the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA), [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]] (BATF).\n\n\n==Issues==\n\n===Prison health care===\n{{See also|Plata v.

In [[Manhattan]], the measurement \"block\" usually refers to a north\u2013south block, which is  {{convert|1/20|mi|m|abbr=on}}. Sometimes people living in places (like Manhattan)  with a regularly spaced street grid will speak of ''long blocks'' and ''short blocks''. Within a typical large North American city, it is often only possible to travel along east\u2013west and north\u2013south streets, so travel distance between two points is often given in the number of blocks east\u2013west plus the number north\u2013south (known to mathematicians as the ''[[taxicab geometry|Manhattan Metric]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html|title=Manhattan distance}}</ref>\n\n===The Earth's circumference===\nThe circumference of a [[great circle]] of the [[Earth]] (about {{convert|40000|km|mi nmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is often compared to large distances. For example, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end at the equator \"would circle the Earth four and a half times\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D7153FF934A3575AC0A96F948260|title=Enough Burnt Sienna to Circle the Globe|date=7 September 1989}}</ref> According to [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]], the circumference of a circle through the poles (twice the length of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]) is {{convert|40007862.917|m|yd}} and the length of the [[equator]] is {{convert|40075016.686|m|yd}}. Despite the fact that the difference (0.17%) between the two is insignificant at the low precision that these quantities are typically given to, it is nevertheless often specified as being at the equator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe definitions of both the [[nautical mile]] and the [[kilometre]] were originally derived from the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. The nautical mile was defined as a [[minute of arc]] of [[latitude]] measured along any meridian. A circle has 360 degrees, and each degree is 60 minutes, so the nautical mile was defined as {{frac|1|21,600}} of the Earth's circumference, or about 1,852.22 [[metre]]s. However, by international agreement, it is now defined to be exactly {{convert|1852|m|ft}}.\n\nThe metre was originally defined as {{frac|1|10,000,000}} of the distance from a pole to the equator, or as {{frac|1|40,000,000}} of the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. This standard made the historical metre 0.0197% longer than the modern standard metre, which is calculated based on the distance covered by light in a vacuum in a set amount of time.\n\n===Earth-to-Moon distance===\nThe distance between the Earth's and the Moon's surfaces is, on average, approximately {{convert|380000|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}. This distance is sometimes used in the same manner as the circumference of the Earth; that is, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end \"would reach all the way to the Moon and back two-and-a-half times\".\n\nThe abbreviation for the Earth-to-Moon distance is \"LD\" which stands for \"[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar Distance]]\", used in astronomy to express close approaches of Earth by [[minor planet]]s.\n\n===Siriometer===\nThe [[siriometer]] is a rarely used astronomical measure equal to one million [[astronomical unit]]s, i.e., one million times the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This distance is equal to about 15.8&nbsp;[[light-year]]s, 149.6&nbsp;[[peta-|P]]m or 4.8&nbsp;[[parsec]]s, and is about twice the distance from Earth to the star [[Sirius]].<!--Google test prefers US spelling-->\n\n=== Pistol Shot ===\nCaptain Phillip chose a deep cove \"where ships could anchor at a half pistol shot from the shore.\"\n\n==Area==\n===Barn===\n{{Main|Barn (unit)}}\nOne barn is 10<sup>\u221228</sup> square metres, about the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus.

The amount of material that, say, an aircraft could carry into the air is often visualised as the number of bags of cement that it could lift.

In case of planet orbiting a star, ''M<sub>total</sub>'' can be approximated to mean the mass of the central object. More specifically in the case of Sun and Earth the numbers reduce to ''M<sub>total</sub>'' ~ 1, ''a'' ~ 1 and ''T'' ~ 1.\n\n==Time==\n<!-- Please keep these sorted in ascending order -->\n\n===Light-distance===\n[[George Gamow]] discussed measurements of time such as the \"light-mile\" and \"light-foot\", the time taken for light to travel the specified unit distance, defined by \"reversing the procedure\" used in defining a light-year.<ref>{{cite book |author=George Gamow|title=One Two Three ...

A sidereal day is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0905 SI seconds.\n\n===Decimal time systems===\n{{main|Decimal time}}\n[[File:Decimal_Time_Clock.jpeg|thumb|Decimal Time clock reading 2.50 DT equivalent to 6 AM standard time]]\nThe measurement of time is unique in SI in that while the [[second]] is the base unit, and measurements of time smaller than a second use prefixed units smaller than a second (e.g. microsecond, nanosecond, etc.), measurements larger than a second instead use traditional divisions, including the [[sexagesimal]]-based ''[[minute]]'' and ''[[hour]]'' as well as the less regular ''[[day]]'' and ''[[year]]'' units.\n\nSI allows for the use of larger prefixed units based on the second, a system known as [[metric time]], but this is seldom used, since the number of seconds in a day (86,400 or, [[leap second|in rare cases, 86,401]]) negate one of the metric system's primary advantages: easy conversion by multiplying or dividing by powers of ten.\n\nThere have been numerous proposals and usage of [[decimal time]], most of which were based on the day as the base unit, such that the number of units between any two events that happen at the same time of day would be equal to the number of days between them multiplied by some integer power of ten. In dynastic China, the [[k\u00e8]] was a unit that represented {{frac|1|100}} of a day (it has since been refined to {{frac|1|96}} of a day, or 15 minutes). In France, a decimal time system in place from 1793 to 1805 divided the day into 10 hours, each divided into 100 minutes, in turn each divided into 100 seconds; the [[French Republican Calendar]] further extended this by assembling days into ten-day \"weeks\". [[Ordinal date]]s and [[Julian day]]s, the latter of which has seen use in astronomy as it is not subject to [[leap year]] complications) allow for the expression of a decimal portion of the day.<ref>See, for instance, the [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh current Mean Julian Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606205531/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh |date=6 June 2011 }}, precise to 6 decimal place, from the [[United States Naval Observatory]].</ref> In the mid-1960s, to defeat the advantage of the recently introduced computers for the then popular rally racing in the Midwest, competition lag times in a few events were given in centids ({{frac|1|100}} day, 864 seconds, 14.4 minutes), millids ({{frac|1|1,000}} day, 86.4 seconds) and centims ({{frac|1|100}} minute, 0.6 seconds) the latter two looking and sounding a bit like the related units of minutes and seconds. Decimal time proposals are frequently used in fiction, often in [[futurism|futuristic]] works.\n\nIn addition to decimal time, there also exist [[binary clock]]s and [[hexadecimal time]].\n\n===Sol===\n{{main|Sol (day on Mars)}}\n{{further|Timekeeping on Mars}}\nThe United States-based [[NASA]], when conducting missions to the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], has typically used a time of day system calibrated to the mean solar day on that planet (known as a \"sol\"), training those involved on those missions to acclimate to that length of day, which is 88,775 SI seconds, or 2,375 seconds (about 39 minutes) longer than the mean solar day on Earth. NASA's Martian timekeeping system (instead of breaking down the sol into 25\u00d753\u00d767 or 25\u00d767\u00d753 SI second divisions) slows down clocks so that the 24-hour day is stretched to the length of that on Mars; Martian hours, minutes and seconds are thus 2.75% longer than their SI-compatible counterparts.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/spirit/a3_20040108.html |title=Watchmaker With Time to Lose |website=JPL Mars Exploration Rovers |year=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.space.com/20243-mars-rover-curiosity-discoveries-grotzinger.html |title=After Finding Mars Was Habitable, Curiosity Keeps Roving |first=Nola Taylor |last=Redd |website=space.com |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Darian calendar]] is an arrangement of sols into a Martian year. It maintains a seven-sol week (retaining Sunday through Saturday naming customs), with four weeks to a month and 24 months to a Martian year, which contains 668 or 669 sols depending on [[leap year]]s. The last Saturday of every six months is skipped over in the Darian calendar.\n\n===Dog year===\n[[File:10 yr old Mastiff.JPG|thumb|A 10-year-old [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]]]\nThere are two diametrically opposed definitions of the ''dog year'', primarily used to approximate the equivalent age of [[dog]]s and other animals with similar life spans. Both are based upon a [[List of common misconceptions|popular myth]] regarding the [[aging in dogs|aging of dogs]] that states that a dog ages seven years in the time it takes a human to age one year.\n*One seventh of a year, or approximately 52 days.<ref name=dogyear>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110612143355/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43339983/ns/today-today_pets_and_animals Multimillionaire pooch dies at age 12 (84 in dog years)].

Most dogs are sexually mature by 1 year old, which corresponds to perhaps 13 years old in humans. [[Giant dog breed]]s and [[bulldog]]s tend to have the strongest linear correspondence to human aging, with longer adolescences and shorter overall lifespans; such breeds typically age about nine times as fast as humans throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=10 June 2009|title=Sexual Maturity&nbsp;\u2014 Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Galactic year===\n{{Main|Galactic year}}\nThe galactic year, GY, is the time it takes the solar system to revolve once around the galactic core, approximately 250 million years ([[megaannum]] or \"Ma\").

Each Kermit is equivalent to 14.4 minutes; the derivative math of (24 hours x 60 minutes/hour )/100. More precise time can be counted by dividing by 1000 or even 10000. The name Kermit came from a combination of the surname of the president of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in 1983 (Dr. [[Larkin Kerwin]]). The original working model of KerMetric time as conceived by W. Thayer of NRC was assembled by the designated Clock Construction Team of John Phillips, Ron Hawkins, Les Moore and Willie Thayer in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/timemetricdispcalc3.html|title=KerMetric Time Display Calculator|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Moment ===\nA '''[[Moment (time)|moment]]''' '''was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] unit of time'''. The movement of a shadow on a [[sundial]] covered 40 moments in a [[Solar time|solar hour]]. An hour in this case meant one twelfth of the period between [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. The length of a [[Solar time|solar hour]] depended on the length of the day, which in turn varied with the [[season]], so the length of a [[Moment (time)|moment]] in modern [[Second|seconds]] was not fixed, but '''on [[average]], a [[Moment (time)|moment]] corresponded to 90 seconds.'''\n\n===Thirds, Fourths===\n\nThe term \"[[Minute]]\" usually means {{frac|1|60}} of an [[hour]], coming from \"a minute division of an hour\". The term \"[[Second]]\" comes from \"the [[Second#Sexagesimal_divisions_of_calendar_time_and_day|second minute division]] of an hour\", as it's {{frac|1|60}} of a minute, or {{frac|1|60}} of {{frac|1|60}} of an hour. While usually sub-second units are represented with [[International_System_of_Units|SI]] prefixes on the second (e.g., [[millisecond|milliseconds]]), this system can be extrapolated further, such that a \"Third\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a second, and a \"Fourth\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a third, etc. These units are occasionally used in astronomy to denote angles.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Herschel |first=William |authorlink= |year=1785 |title=Catalogue of Double Stars |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] |volume=75 |issue= |pages=40\u2013126 |jstor=106749 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1785.0006 }}</ref>\n\n==Angular measure==\n===Furman===\nThe Furman is a unit of angular measure equal to {{frac|1|65,536}} of a circle, or just under 20 [[arcsecond]]s.

There is no consensus as to its name, but it has been called the 8-Bit Furman, the Small Furman, the Furboy and more recently, the miFurman, (milli-binary-Furman). These units are convenient because they form cycles: for the 8-bit unit, the value overflows from 255 to 0 when a full circle has been traversed, so binary addition and subtraction work as expected. Measures are often made using a [[Gray code]], which is trivially converted into more conventional notation. Its value is equivalent to [[Turn_(angle)#Tau_proposals|Tau]]/256 radians, or about 0.0245436926 radians.\n\n===Grade ''(also grad, gradian, gon)''===\n{{Main|Grad (angle)}}\nCoordinates were measured in grades on official French terrestrial ordnance charts from the French revolution well into the 20th century. 1 grade ''(or in modern symbology 1 gon)'' = 0.9\u00b0 or 0.01 right angle. One advantage of this measure is that the distance between latitude lines 0.01 gon apart at the equator is almost exactly 1 kilometer ''(and would be exactly 1&nbsp;km if the original definition of 1 meter = {{frac|1|10,000}} quarter-meridian had been adhered to)''. One disadvantage is that common angles like 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are expressed by fractional values (33{{frac|1|3}} and 66{{frac|2|3}} respectively) so this \"decimal\" unit failed to displace the \"sexagesimal\" units equilateral-vertex \u2013 degree \u2013 minute \u2013 second invented by Babylonian astronomers.{{POV inline|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Milliradian===\n[[File:mil estimation.jpg|thumb|upright|Estimating milliradian by hand]]\nThe [[milliradian]] (mrad) is an SI derived unit defined as one thousandth of a [[radian]], and has many useful purposes for measuring small angles.

The unit is equivalent to 216,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s ([[cumec]]s).<ref>{{cite web | title=Amazon River \u2013 Facts, History, Animals, & Map | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River | access-date=10 August 2019}}.</ref>\n\n=== Flow: Sverdrup ===\nOne [[Sverdrup]] (Sv) is equal to 1,000,000 cubic metres per second (264,000,000 USgal/s). It is used almost exclusively in [[oceanography]] to measure the volumetric rate of transport of [[ocean current]]s.\n\n===Energy intensity===\nThe [[langley (unit)|langley]] (symbol Ly) is used to measure solar radiation or [[insolation]]. It is equal to one thermochemical [[calorie]] per square centimetre (4.184{{e|4}}&nbsp;J/m<sup>2</sup> or \u22483.684 BTU/sq&nbsp;ft) and was named after [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]. Its symbol should not be confused with that for the light-year, ly.\n\n===Kinematic viscosity===\nOne of the few [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] units to see wider use, one [[kinematic viscosity|stokes]] (symbol S or St) is a unit of [[kinematics|kinematic]] [[viscosity]], defined as 1&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>/s, i.e., 10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/s (\u22481.08\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/s).\n\n===Angular velocity===\n'''MERU''' (Milli Earth Rate Unit), an [[angular velocity]] equal to {{frac|1|1000}} of Earth's rotation rate: 1 MERU = 0.015 degrees/hour \u2248 0.072921 microradian/second. Sometimes used to measure the angular drift rate of an [[inertial navigation system]].<ref>''Fundamentals of High Accuracy Inertial Navigation,'' Averil B. Chatfield, [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics], 1997, p.32</ref>\n\n===Electromagnetic flux===\nIn [[radio astronomy]], the unit of [[flux|electromagnetic flux]] is the [[jansky]] (symbol Jy), equivalent to 10<sup>\u221226</sup> [[watt]]s per square metre per [[hertz]] (= 10<sup>\u221226</sup>&nbsp;kg/s<sup>2</sup> in base units, about 8.8\u00d710<sup>\u221231</sup>&nbsp;BTU/ft<sup>2</sup>). It is named after the pioneering radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]]. The brightest natural radio sources have flux densities of the order of one to one hundred jansky.\n\n===Metre of water equivalent===\n{{main|Meter water equivalent}}\nA material-dependent unit used in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]] and engineering to measure the thickness of shielding, for example around a [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]], [[particle accelerator]], or [[particle detector|radiation or particle detector]]. 1 mwe of a material is the thickness of that material that provides the equivalent shielding of one metre (\u224839.4&nbsp;in) of water.\n\nThis unit is commonly used in underground science to express the extent to which the [[overburden]] (usually rock) shields an underground space or laboratory from [[cosmic ray]]s. The actual thickness of overburden through which cosmic rays must traverse to reach the underground space varies as a function of direction due to the shape of the overburden, which may be a mountain, or a flat plain, or something more complex like a cliff side. To express the depth of an underground space in mwe (or kmwe for deep sites) as a single number, the convention is to use the depth beneath a flat overburden at [[sea level]] that gives the same overall cosmic ray [[muon]] flux in the underground location.\n\n===Strontium unit: radiation dose===\nThe [[strontium unit]], formerly known as the Sunshine Unit (symbol S.U.), is a unit of biological contamination by radioactive substances (specifically [[strontium-90]]). It is equal to one [[Curie|picocurie]] of Sr-90 per [[gram]] of body [[calcium]]. Since about 2% of the human body mass is calcium, and Sr-90 has a [[half-life]] of 28.78 years, releasing 6.697+2.282 [[electronvolt|MeV]] per disintegration, this works out to about 1.065{{e|-12}}&nbsp;[[gray (unit)|gray]]s per second. The permissible body burden was established at 1,000&nbsp;S.U.\n\n===Banana equivalent dose===\n[[File:Bananen Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|A banana contains [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] in the form of [[potassium-40]]]]\nBananas, like most organic material, naturally contain a certain amount of radioactive isotopes\u2014even in the absence of any artificial pollution or contamination. The [[banana equivalent dose]], defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one banana, expresses the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from nuclear weapons or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people. This is approximately 78 nano[[sievert]]s \u2013 in informal publications one often sees this estimate rounded up to 0.1 \u03bcSv.\n\n===Molar mass of cellulose===\nIn the [[pulp and paper]] industry, [[molar mass]] is traditionally measured with a method where the [[intrinsic viscosity]] (dL/g) of the pulp sample is measured in cupriethylenediamine (Cuen). The intrinsic viscosity [\u03b7] is related to the weight-average molar mass (in [[atomic mass unit|dalton]]s) by the [[Mark-Houwink equation]]: [\u03b7] = 0.070 M<sub>w</sub><sup>0.70</sup>.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038|pmid = 23398992|title = A re-investigation of the Mark\u2013Houwink\u2013Sakurada parameters for cellulose in Cuen: A study based on size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering and viscometry|journal = Journal of Chromatography A|volume = 1281|pages = 32\u201337|year = 2013|last1 = Kes|first1 = M\u00fcr\u015fide|last2 = Christensen|first2 = Bj\u00f8rn E.}}</ref> However, it is typical to cite [\u03b7] values directly in dL/g, as the \"viscosity\" of the cellulose, confusingly as it is not a viscosity.\n\n===Iodine, bromine and kappa number===\nIn measuring unsaturation in fatty acids, the traditional method is the [[iodine value|iodine number]]. Iodine adds stoichiometrically to double bonds, so their amount is reported in grams of iodine spent per 100 grams of oil. The standard unit is a dimensionless stoichiometry ratio of moles double bonds to moles fatty acid. A similar quantity, [[bromine number]], is used in gasoline analysis.\n\nIn pulp and paper industry, a similar [[kappa number]] is used to measure how much [[bleaching]] a pulp requires. [[Potassium permanganate]] is added to react with the unsaturated compounds (lignin and uronic acids) in the pulp and back-titrated. Originally with [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine and hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]] the required quantity of [[chlorine]] could be then calculated, although modern methods use multiple stages. Since the oxidizable compounds are not exclusively lignin and the partially pulped lignin does not have a single stoichiometry, the relation between the kappa number and the precise [[amount of substance|amount]] of lignin is inexact.\n\n==Demography and epidemiology==\n[[Demography]] and quantitative [[epidemiology]] are [[statistical]] fields that deal with [[count data|counts]] or proportions of people, or rates of change in these. [[Count data|Counts]] and proportions are technically [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], and so have no [[units of measurement]], although identifiers such as \"people\", \"births\", \"infections\" and the like are used for clarity. Rates of change are [[rate (mathematics)|counts per unit of time]] and strictly have inverse time dimensions (per unit of time). In [[demography#Common Rates and Ratios|demography]] and epidemiology expressions such as [[Mortality rate|\"deaths per year\"]] are used to clarify what is being measured.\n\n[[Prevalence]], a common measure in [[epidemiology]] is strictly a type of [[denominator data]], a dimensionless ratio or proportion. [[Prevalence]] may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage or as the number of cases per 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 in the population of interest.\n\n===Micromort===\n{{Main|Micromort}}\nA micromort is a unit of [[risk]] measuring a one-in-a-million [[probability]] of [[death]] (from [[micro-]] and [[Wikt:mortality|mortality]]). Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A microprobability is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. For example, smoking 1.4 cigarettes increases one's death risk by one micromort, as does traveling {{convert|230|mi|abbr=in|order=flip}} by car.\n\n===Numbers of people: Stadium capacities===\n[[File:AFL Grand Final 2010 on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|To make large numbers of people comprehensible, the capacity of large stadiums is often used. Here the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) is in the process of filling with 100,016 spectators on [[2010 AFL Grand Final|AFL grand final day in 2010]].]]\nThe large numbers of people involved in [[demography]] are often difficult to comprehend. A useful visualisation tool is the audience capacity of large sports stadiums (often about 100,000). Often the capacity of the largest stadium in a region serves as a unit for a large number of people. For example, Uruguay's [[Estadio Centenario]] is often used in [[Uruguay]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Ahora la borrachera es \"previa\" a la fiesta | website=elpais.com.uy | date=15 October 2009 | url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/091011/pciuda-447246/ciudades/ahora-la-borrachera-es-previa-a-la-fiesta | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015002051/http://www.elpais.com.uy/091011/pciuda-447246/ciudades/ahora-la-borrachera-es-previa-a-la-fiesta | archive-date=15 October 2009 | url-status=dead | language=es | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The unemployed would fill three and a half Centennial Stadiums (Spanish) | website=LARED21 | date=7 November 2002 | url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/97129-los-desocupados-colmarian-tres-y-medio-estadios-centenarios | language=es | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> while in parts of the United States, [[Michigan Stadium]] is used in this manner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In Australia, the capacity of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (about 100,000) is often cited in this manner.

Among the ~300 million people in the United States, there are ~300 people struck by lightning annually and ~30 killed, making a lightning strike a one in a million event and a death a one in ten million event; given a mean life expectancy of slightly over 75 years, the chances of an American ever being struck in their lifetime is about 1 in 13,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|title=NWS Lightning Safety Home Page|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|accessdate=27 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308162344/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|archive-date=8 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nFor example: \"A person is about 15 times more likely to be struck by lightning in a given year than to be killed by a stranger with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or chronic psychosis\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gun Violence and Mental Illness|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26341929-gun-violence-and-mental-illness?from_search=true|accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Computer and information science==\nThe growth of computing has necessitated the creation of many new units, several of which are based on unusual foundations.\n\n===Data volume===\n[[File:Print vs. bytes.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio and video clips]]\nVolume or capacity of data is often compared to various famous works of literature or to large collections of writing. Popular units include bibles, encyclopaediae, [[complete works of Shakespeare|the complete works of Shakespeare]], and the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nWhen the [[Compact Disc]] began to be used as a [[data storage device]], the [[CD-ROM]], journalists had to compare the disc capacity (650 [[megabyte]]s) to something everyone could imagine. Since many Western households had a Christian [[Bible]], and the [[Bible]] is a comparatively long [[book]], it was often chosen for this purpose. The [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]] in uncompressed plain 8-bit text contains about 4.5 million characters,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10|title=The Bible, Old and New Testaments, King James Version \u2013 Project Gutenberg|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> so a [[CD-ROM]] can store about 150 [[Bible]]s.\n\nThe print version of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' is another common data volume metric. It contains approximately 300 million characters,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|author=John Markoff|title=44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet|accessdate=7 December 2011|date=8 February 1994|work=The New York Times}}</ref> so two copies would fit onto a [[CD-ROM]] and still have 50 megabytes (or about 11 bibles) left over.\n\nThe term ''Library of Congress'' is often used as an unusual unit of measurement to represent an impressively large quantity of [[data (computing)|data]] when discussing [[computer data storage|digital storage]] or [[computer network|networking technologies]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It refers to the US [[Library of Congress]]. Information researchers have estimated that the entire print collections of the [[Library of Congress]] represent roughly 10 [[terabyte]]s of uncompressed [[text file|textual data]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/how-much-info.pdf#page=110|author=Peter Lyman|author2=Hal R.

The nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in [[binary-coded decimal]] format, or to represent a single hexadecimal digit. Less commonly, 'nibble' may be used for any contiguous portion of a byte of specified length, e.g. \"6-bit nibble\"; this usage is most likely to be encountered in connection with a hardware architecture in which the word length is not a multiple of 8, such as older 36-bit minicomputers.\n\n===FLOPS===\n{{Main|FLOPS}}\nIn [[computing]], FLOPS (''FL''oating point ''O''perations ''P''er ''S''econd) is a measure of a computer's computing power. It is also common to see measurements of kilo, mega, giga, and teraFLOPS.\n\nIt is also used to compare the performance of computers in practice.<ref>{{cite web |title=TOP500 LIST November 2018 |url=https://top500.org/lists/2018/11/ |website=Top 500 |publisher=Top 500 |accessdate=21 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== BogoMips ===\n{{Main|BogoMips}}\nA measure to determine the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed. It was invented by [[Linus Torvalds]] and is nowadays present on every [[Linux]] operating system. However, it is not a meaningful measure to assess the actual [[Central processing unit|CPU]] performance.\n\n===KLOC: computer program length===\nA computer programming expression, the [[source lines of code|K-LOC]] or KLOC, pronounced ''kay-lok'', standing for \"kilo-[[source lines of code|lines of code]]\", i.e., thousand lines of code. The unit was used, especially by [[IBM]] managers,<ref>{{cite web | title=Triumph of the Nerds: The Transcripts, Part II | website=PBS | url=https://www.pbs.org/nerds/part2.html | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> to express the amount of work required to develop a piece of software. Given that estimates of 20 lines of functional code per day per programmer were often used, it is apparent that 1 K-LOC could take one programmer as long as 50 working days, or 10 working weeks. This measure is no longer in widespread use because different computer languages require different numbers of lines to achieve the same result (occasionally the measure \"assembly equivalent lines of code\" is used, with appropriate conversion factors from the language actually used to assembly language).\n\nError rates in programming are also measured in \"Errors per K-LOC\", which is called the ''defect density''. NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center#Software Assurance Technology Center|SATC]] is one of the few organisations to claim zero defects in a large (>500K-LOC) project, for the space shuttle software.\n\nAn alternative measurement was defined by [[Pegasus Mail]] author [[David Harris (software developer)|David Harris]]: the \"WaP\" is equivalent to 71,500 lines of program code, because that number of lines is the length of one edition of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=April 2017 \u2013 \"How many WaPs is that?\" | website=Pegasus Mail and Mercury | date=30 November 2011 | url=http://www.pmail.com/devnews_archive.htm | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Ticks===\nThe \"tick\" is the amount of time between timer [[interrupt]]s generated by the timer circuit of a CPU.

[[James D. Hardy]], [[Herbert G. Wolff]], and [[Helen Goodell]] of [[Cornell University]] proposed the unit based on their studies of pain during the 1940s and 1950s. They defined one dol to equal to \"just noticeable differences\" ([[jnd]]'s) in pain. The unit never came into widespread use and other methods are now used to assess the level of pain experienced by patients.\n\nThe Schmidt sting pain index and Starr sting pain index are [[pain scale]]s rating the relative pain caused by different [[hymenoptera]]n stings. Schmidt has refined his [[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]] (scaled from 1 to 4) with extensive anecdotal experience, culminating in a paper published in 1990 which classifies the stings of 78 species and 41 genera of Hymenoptera.

It is normally used to measure the height of horses in some English-speaking countries, including Australia,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826125716/http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 August 2006 |title=Equestrian Federation of Australia National Measuring Scheme Effective from 1 January 2002 and amended in March 2002 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 2002 |website=www.equestrian.org.au/ |publisher=Equestrian Federation of Australia |accessdate=27 February 2014}}</ref> Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.\n\n===Light-nanosecond===\nThe light-nanosecond is defined as exactly 29.9792458 [[centimetre|cm]]. It was popularized as a unit of distance by [[Grace Hopper]] as the distance which a photon could travel in one billionth of a second (roughly 30 [[centimetre|cm]] or one [[foot (unit)|foot]]): \"The [[speed of light]] is one foot per nanosecond.\" In her speaking engagements, she was well known for passing out light-nanoseconds of wire to the audience, and contrasting it with light-microseconds (a coil of wire 1,000 times as long) and light-picoseconds (the size of ground [[black pepper]]). Over the course of her life, she found many uses for this visual aid, including demonstrating the waste of sub-optimal programming, illustrating advances in computer speed, and simply giving young scientists and policy makers the ability to conceptualize the magnitude of very large and small numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/hopper-story.html |title=Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper|date=4 May 2006 |publisher=US Navy}}</ref>\n\n===Metric foot===\nA [[metric foot]] (defined as 300&nbsp;mm, or about 11.8 inches) has been used occasionally in the UK<ref>{{cite web |  title=BBC TV Centre | website=History of Television Studios in London | url=http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/tv%20centre%20history.htm | quote=Measurements are in metric feet (30cm)...}}</ref> but has never been an official unit.\n\n===Horse===\n{{main|Horse length}}\nHorses are used to measure distances in [[horse racing]] \u2013 a ''horse length'' (shortened to merely a ''length'' when the context makes it obvious) equals roughly {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=off|disp=or}}.

The length of a [[Eight (rowing)|rowing eight]] is about {{convert|62|ft|m}}. A shorter distance is the ''[[Glossary of rowing terms#canvas|canvas]]'', which is the length of the covered part of the boat between the bow and the bow oarsman. The [[Racing Rules of Sailing]] also makes heavy use of boat lengths.\n\n===Football field (length)===\n<!--American football field (unit) redirects here.

The field is {{convert|160|ft|yd m|abbr=on}} wide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2015-nfl-rulebook#rule-1.-the-field|title=2015 NFL Rulebook}}</ref>\n\nA [[Canadian football field]] is {{convert|65|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on}} long, including two {{convert|20|yd|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} long end zones.\n\nMedia in the UK also use the [[association football pitch|football pitch]] as a unit of length, although the area of the [[association football]] pitch is not fixed, but may vary within limits of {{convert|90|-|120|m|yd|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|45|-|90|m|yd|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in width. The usual size of a football pitch is {{convert|105|x|68|m|yd|abbr=on}}, the dimensions used for matches in the [[UEFA Champions League]].\n\n===Block===\nA [[city block]] (in most US cities) is between {{convert|1/16|and|1/8|mi|m|abbr=on}}. In [[Manhattan]], the measurement \"block\" usually refers to a north\u2013south block, which is  {{convert|1/20|mi|m|abbr=on}}. Sometimes people living in places (like Manhattan)  with a regularly spaced street grid will speak of ''long blocks'' and ''short blocks''. Within a typical large North American city, it is often only possible to travel along east\u2013west and north\u2013south streets, so travel distance between two points is often given in the number of blocks east\u2013west plus the number north\u2013south (known to mathematicians as the ''[[taxicab geometry|Manhattan Metric]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html|title=Manhattan distance}}</ref>\n\n===The Earth's circumference===\nThe circumference of a [[great circle]] of the [[Earth]] (about {{convert|40000|km|mi nmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is often compared to large distances. For example, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end at the equator \"would circle the Earth four and a half times\".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D7153FF934A3575AC0A96F948260|title=Enough Burnt Sienna to Circle the Globe|date=7 September 1989}}</ref> According to [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]], the circumference of a circle through the poles (twice the length of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]) is {{convert|40007862.917|m|yd}} and the length of the [[equator]] is {{convert|40075016.686|m|yd}}. Despite the fact that the difference (0.17%) between the two is insignificant at the low precision that these quantities are typically given to, it is nevertheless often specified as being at the equator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\nThe definitions of both the [[nautical mile]] and the [[kilometre]] were originally derived from the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. The nautical mile was defined as a [[minute of arc]] of [[latitude]] measured along any meridian. A circle has 360 degrees, and each degree is 60 minutes, so the nautical mile was defined as {{frac|1|21,600}} of the Earth's circumference, or about 1,852.22 [[metre]]s. However, by international agreement, it is now defined to be exactly {{convert|1852|m|ft}}.\n\nThe metre was originally defined as {{frac|1|10,000,000}} of the distance from a pole to the equator, or as {{frac|1|40,000,000}} of the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. This standard made the historical metre 0.0197% longer than the modern standard metre, which is calculated based on the distance covered by light in a vacuum in a set amount of time.\n\n===Earth-to-Moon distance===\nThe distance between the Earth's and the Moon's surfaces is, on average, approximately {{convert|380000|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}. This distance is sometimes used in the same manner as the circumference of the Earth; that is, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end \"would reach all the way to the Moon and back two-and-a-half times\".\n\nThe abbreviation for the Earth-to-Moon distance is \"LD\" which stands for \"[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar Distance]]\", used in astronomy to express close approaches of Earth by [[minor planet]]s.\n\n===Siriometer===\nThe [[siriometer]] is a rarely used astronomical measure equal to one million [[astronomical unit]]s, i.e., one million times the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This distance is equal to about 15.8&nbsp;[[light-year]]s, 149.6&nbsp;[[peta-|P]]m or 4.8&nbsp;[[parsec]]s, and is about twice the distance from Earth to the star [[Sirius]].<!--Google test prefers US spelling-->\n\n==Area==\n===Barn===\n{{Main|Barn (unit)}}\nOne barn is 10<sup>\u221228</sup> square metres, about the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus.

In dynastic China, the [[k\u00e8]] was a unit that represented {{frac|1|100}} of a day (it has since been refined to {{frac|1|96}} of a day, or 15 minutes). In France, a decimal time system in place from 1793 to 1805 divided the day into 10 hours, each divided into 100 minutes, in turn each divided into 100 seconds; the [[French Republican Calendar]] further extended this by assembling days into ten-day \"weeks\". [[Ordinal date]]s and [[Julian day]]s, the latter of which has seen use in astronomy as it is not subject to [[leap year]] complications) allow for the expression of a decimal portion of the day.<ref>See, for instance, the [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh current Mean Julian Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606205531/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh |date=6 June 2011 }}, precise to 6 decimal place, from the [[United States Naval Observatory]].</ref> In the mid-1960s, to defeat the advantage of the recently introduced computers for the then popular rally racing in the Midwest, competition lag times in a few events were given in centids ({{frac|1|100}} day, 864 seconds, 14.4 minutes), millids ({{frac|1|1,000}} day, 86.4 seconds) and centims ({{frac|1|100}} minute, 0.6 seconds) the latter two looking and sounding a bit like the related units of minutes and seconds. Decimal time proposals are frequently used in fiction, often in [[futurism|futuristic]] works.\n\nIn addition to decimal time, there also exist [[binary clock]]s and [[hexadecimal time]].\n\n===Sol===\n{{main|Sol (day on Mars)}}\n{{further|Timekeeping on Mars}}\nThe United States-based [[NASA]], when conducting missions to the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], has typically used a time of day system calibrated to the mean solar day on that planet (known as a \"sol\"), training those involved on those missions to acclimate to that length of day, which is 88,775 SI seconds, or 2,375 seconds (about 39 minutes) longer than the mean solar day on Earth. NASA's Martian timekeeping system (instead of breaking down the sol into 25\u00d753\u00d767 or 25\u00d767\u00d753 SI second divisions) slows down clocks so that the 24-hour day is stretched to the length of that on Mars; Martian hours, minutes and seconds are thus 2.75% longer than their SI-compatible counterparts.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/spirit/a3_20040108.html |title=Watchmaker With Time to Lose |website=JPL Mars Exploration Rovers |year=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.space.com/20243-mars-rover-curiosity-discoveries-grotzinger.html |title=After Finding Mars Was Habitable, Curiosity Keeps Roving |first=Nola Taylor |last=Redd |website=space.com |date=18 March 2013 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Darian calendar]] is an arrangement of sols into a Martian year. It maintains a seven-sol week (retaining Sunday through Saturday naming customs), with four weeks to a month and 24 months to a Martian year, which contains 668 or 669 sols depending on [[leap year]]s. The last Saturday of every six months is skipped over in the Darian calendar.\n\n===Dog year===\n[[File:10 yr old Mastiff.JPG|thumb|A 10-year-old [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]]]\nThere are two diametrically opposed definitions of the ''dog year'', primarily used to approximate the equivalent age of [[dog]]s and other animals with similar life spans. Both are based upon a [[List of common misconceptions|popular myth]] regarding the [[aging in dogs|aging of dogs]] that states that a dog ages seven years in the time it takes a human to age one year.\n*One seventh of a year, or approximately 52 days.<ref name=dogyear>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110612143355/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43339983/ns/today-today_pets_and_animals Multimillionaire pooch dies at age 12 (84 in dog years)].

Most dogs are sexually mature by 1 year old, which corresponds to perhaps 13 years old in humans. [[Giant dog breed]]s and [[bulldog]]s tend to have the strongest linear correspondence to human aging, with longer adolescences and shorter overall lifespans; such breeds typically age about nine times as fast as humans throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archivedate=10 June 2009|title=Sexual Maturity&nbsp;\u2014 Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|accessdate=22 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Galactic year===\n{{Main|Galactic year}}\nThe galactic year, GY, is the time it takes the solar system to revolve once around the galactic core, approximately 250 million years ([[megaannum]] or \"Ma\"). It is a convenient unit for long-term measurements. For example, oceans appeared on Earth after 4&nbsp;GY, life is detectable at 5&nbsp;GY, and multicellular organisms first appeared at 15&nbsp;GY. The [[age of the Earth]] is estimated at about 20&nbsp;GY.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geologic Time Galactic |url=http://www.vendian.org/mncharity/dir3/geologic_time_galactic/ |publisher=vendian.org |accessdate=19 December 2006}}</ref> This use of GY is not to be confused with Gyr for [[gigayear]] or Gy for [[Gray (unit)]].\n\n===KerMetric time===\nKerMetric time is a concept that divides the 24-hour day into 100 equal parts called Kermits. Each Kermit is equivalent to 14.4 minutes; the derivative math of (24 hours x 60 minutes/hour )/100. More precise time can be counted by dividing by 1000 or even 10000. The name Kermit came from a combination of the surname of the president of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in 1983 (Dr. [[Larkin Kerwin]]). The original working model of KerMetric time as conceived by W. Thayer of NRC was assembled by the designated Clock Construction Team of John Phillips, Ron Hawkins, Les Moore and Willie Thayer in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/timemetricdispcalc3.html|title=KerMetric Time Display Calculator|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Moment ===\nA '''[[Moment (time)|moment]]''' '''was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] unit of time'''. The movement of a shadow on a [[sundial]] covered 40 moments in a [[Solar time|solar hour]]. An hour in this case meant one twelfth of the period between [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. The length of a [[Solar time|solar hour]] depended on the length of the day, which in turn varied with the [[season]], so the length of a [[Moment (time)|moment]] in modern [[Second|seconds]] was not fixed, but '''on [[average]], a [[Moment (time)|moment]] corresponded to 90 seconds.'''\n\n===Thirds, Fourths===\n\nThe term \"[[Minute]]\" usually means {{frac|1|60}} of an [[hour]], coming from \"a minute division of an hour\". The term \"[[Second]]\" comes from \"the [[Second#Sexagesimal_divisions_of_calendar_time_and_day|second minute division]] of an hour\", as it's {{frac|1|60}} of a minute, or {{frac|1|60}} of {{frac|1|60}} of an hour. While usually sub-second units are represented with [[International_System_of_Units|SI]] prefixes on the second (e.g., [[millisecond|milliseconds]]), this system can be extrapolated further, such that a \"Third\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a second, and a \"Fourth\" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a third, etc. These units are occasionally used in astronomy to denote angles.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Herschel |first=William |authorlink= |year=1785 |title=Catalogue of Double Stars |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] |volume=75 |issue= |pages=40\u2013126 |jstor=106749 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1785.0006 }}</ref>\n\n==Angular measure==\n===Furman===\nThe Furman is a unit of angular measure equal to {{frac|1|65,536}} of a circle, or just under 20 [[arcsecond]]s. It is named for Alan T. Furman, the American mathematician who adapted the [[CORDIC]] algorithm for 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic sometime around 1980.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Furman |first=Alan T. |title=The Cordic Algorithm for Fixed-Point Polar Geometry |url=http://www.forth.org/fd/FD-V04N1.pdf |journal=FORTH Dimensions |volume=4 |pages=14\u201315 |accessdate=16 January 2009 }}</ref> 16 bits give a resolution of 2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536 distinct angles.\n\n===Binary degree, binary radian, brad===\n{{See also|Binary scaling#Binary angles}}\nA related unit of angular measure equal to {{Frac|1|256}} of a circle, represented by 8 bits, has found some use in machinery control where fine precision is not required, most notably crankshaft and camshaft position in [[engine control unit|internal combustion engine controllers]], and in video game programming. There is no consensus as to its name, but it has been called the 8-Bit Furman, the Small Furman, the Furboy and more recently, the miFurman, (milli-binary-Furman). These units are convenient because they form cycles: for the 8-bit unit, the value overflows from 255 to 0 when a full circle has been traversed, so binary addition and subtraction work as expected. Measures are often made using a [[Gray code]], which is trivially converted into more conventional notation. Its value is equivalent to [[Turn_(angle)#Tau_proposals|Tau]]/256 radians, or about 0.0245436926 radians.\n\n===Grade ''(also grad, gradian, gon)''===\n{{Main|Grad (angle)}}\nCoordinates were measured in grades on official French terrestrial ordnance charts from the French revolution well into the 20th century. 1 grade ''(or in modern symbology 1 gon)'' = 0.9\u00b0 or 0.01 right angle. One advantage of this measure is that the distance between latitude lines 0.01 gon apart at the equator is almost exactly 1 kilometer ''(and would be exactly 1&nbsp;km if the original definition of 1 meter = {{frac|1|10,000}} quarter-meridian had been adhered to)''. One disadvantage is that common angles like 30\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 are expressed by fractional values (33{{frac|1|3}} and 66{{frac|2|3}} respectively) so this \"decimal\" unit failed to displace the \"sexagesimal\" units equilateral-vertex \u2013 degree \u2013 minute \u2013 second invented by Babylonian astronomers.{{POV inline|date=October 2019}}\n\n===Milliradian===\n[[File:mil estimation.jpg|thumb|upright|Estimating milliradian by hand]]\nThe [[milliradian]] (mrad) is an SI derived unit defined as one thousandth of a [[radian]], and has many useful purposes for measuring small angles. Milliradians are specifically used in optics for adjustment and range estimation, but also in general for measurement of small angles within science and technology.\n\nThe true milliradian (2000{{pi}} per [[Turn (angle)|turn]], or approximately 6283.18 per turn) must not be confused with variations such as the NATO mil (6400 per turn), the Swedish streck (6300 per turn) or the Warsaw Pact mil (6000 per turn), which are used by military organisations for range estimation and translate this map coordinates used for directing artillery fire.<ref>{{cite book |title=Collins Concise Dictionary of the English Language|date=1982|isbn=978-0-00-433091-4|editor-first=William T|editor-last=Macleod}}</ref>\n\n===MERU (Milli Earth Rate Unit)===\nThe '''MERU''', or Milli Earth Rate Unit, is an angular velocity equal to 1/1000 of Earth's [[sidereal time|rotation rate]].

One ton of TNT produces 4.184{{e|9}} joules, or (by arbitrary definition) exactly {{10^|9}} [[calorie|thermochemical calories]] (approximately 3.964{{e|6}} BTU). This definition is only loosely based on the actual physical properties of TNT.\n\n===Hiroshima bomb and Halifax explosion===\n[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiroshima bomb explosion]]\n[[File:Halifax Explosion blast cloud.jpg|thumb|upright|Halifax explosion]]\n{{Main|Moment magnitude scale#Nuclear explosions}}\nThe energy released by the [[Little Boy|Hiroshima bomb]] explosion (about 15&nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 6{{e|13}}&nbsp;J) is often used by [[geologist]]s as a unit when describing the energy of [[earthquake]]s, [[volcanic eruption]]s, and [[impact event|asteroid impact]]s.\n\nPrior to the detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, the size of the [[Halifax Explosion]] (about 3&nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 1.26{{e|13}}&nbsp;J), was the standard for this type of relative measurement.

It is suitably large to quantify energy usage by nations or by the planet as whole using everyday numbers.  For example, in 2004, US energy consumption was about 100 Q/year, while demand worldwide was about 400 Q/year.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Basic Choices and Constraints on Long-Term Energy Supplies|date=July 2004 |journal=Physics Today|volume=57|issue=7|pages=47\u201352|doi=10.1063/1.1784302|last1=Weisz|first1=Paul B.|bibcode=2004PhT....57g..47W|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===Foe===\nA [[Foe (unit)|foe]] is a unit of energy equal to {{10^|44}}&nbsp;[[joule]]s (\u22489.478{{e|40}} [[British thermal unit|BTU]]) that was coined by physicist Gerry Brown of [[Stony Brook University]]. To measure the staggeringly immense amount of energy produced by a [[supernova]], specialists occasionally use the \"foe\", an acronym derived from the phrase [ten to the power of] '''f'''ifty-'''o'''ne '''e'''rgs, or {{10^|51}}&nbsp;[[erg]]s. This unit of measure is convenient because a supernova typically releases about one foe of observable energy in a very short period of time (which can be measured in seconds).\n\n==Other metric-compatible scales==\n===Power: Ton of refrigeration===\n{{Main|Ton of refrigeration}}\nThe rate at which heat is removed by melting {{convert|1|ST|kg|spell=in}} of ice over twenty-four hours is referred to as a ton of refrigeration, or sometimes a ton of cooling. This unit of refrigeration capacity came from the days when large blocks of ice were used for cooling, and is still used to describe the heat-removal capabilities of refrigerators and chillers today. One ton of refrigeration is equal to 12,000 BTU/h exactly, or 3.517&nbsp;kW.\n\n===Flow: Amazon River===\nThe volume of discharge of the [[Amazon River]] sometimes used to describe large volumes of water flow such as ocean currents. The unit is equivalent to 216,000&nbsp;m<sup>3</sup>/s ([[cumec]]s).<ref>{{cite web | title=Amazon River \u2013 Facts, History, Animals, & Map | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River | access-date=10 August 2019}}.</ref>\n\n=== Flow: Sverdrup ===\nOne [[Sverdrup]] (Sv) is equal to 1,000,000 cubic metres per second (264,000,000 USgal/s). It is used almost exclusively in [[oceanography]] to measure the volumetric rate of transport of [[ocean current]]s.\n\n===Energy intensity===\nThe [[langley (unit)|langley]] (symbol Ly) is used to measure solar radiation or [[insolation]]. It is equal to one thermochemical [[calorie]] per square centimetre (4.184{{e|4}}&nbsp;J/m<sup>2</sup> or \u22483.684 BTU/sq&nbsp;ft) and was named after [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]. Its symbol should not be confused with that for the light-year, ly.\n\n===Kinematic viscosity===\nOne of the few [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] units to see wider use, one [[kinematic viscosity|stokes]] (symbol S or St) is a unit of [[kinematics|kinematic]] [[viscosity]], defined as 1&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>/s, i.e., 10<sup>\u22124</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/s (\u22481.08\u00d710<sup>\u22123</sup>&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/s).\n\n===Angular velocity===\n'''MERU''' (Milli Earth Rate Unit), an [[angular velocity]] equal to {{frac|1|1000}} of Earth's rotation rate: 1 MERU = 0.015 degrees/hour \u2248 0.072921 microradian/second. Sometimes used to measure the angular drift rate of an [[inertial navigation system]].<ref>''Fundamentals of High Accuracy Inertial Navigation,'' Averil B. Chatfield, [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics], 1997, p.32</ref>\n\n===Electromagnetic flux===\nIn [[radio astronomy]], the unit of [[flux|electromagnetic flux]] is the [[jansky]] (symbol Jy), equivalent to 10<sup>\u221226</sup> [[watt]]s per square metre per [[hertz]] (= 10<sup>\u221226</sup>&nbsp;kg/s<sup>2</sup> in base units, about 8.8\u00d710<sup>\u221231</sup>&nbsp;BTU/ft<sup>2</sup>). It is named after the pioneering radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]]. The brightest natural radio sources have flux densities of the order of one to one hundred jansky.\n\n===Metre of water equivalent===\n{{main|Meter water equivalent}}\nA material-dependent unit used in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]] and engineering to measure the thickness of shielding, for example around a [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]], [[particle accelerator]], or [[particle detector|radiation or particle detector]]. 1 mwe of a material is the thickness of that material that provides the equivalent shielding of one metre (\u224839.4&nbsp;in) of water.\n\nThis unit is commonly used in underground science to express the extent to which the [[overburden]] (usually rock) shields an underground space or laboratory from [[cosmic ray]]s. The actual thickness of overburden through which cosmic rays must traverse to reach the underground space varies as a function of direction due to the shape of the overburden, which may be a mountain, or a flat plain, or something more complex like a cliff side. To express the depth of an underground space in mwe (or kmwe for deep sites) as a single number, the convention is to use the depth beneath a flat overburden at [[sea level]] that gives the same overall cosmic ray [[muon]] flux in the underground location.\n\n===Strontium unit: radiation dose===\nThe [[strontium unit]], formerly known as the Sunshine Unit (symbol S.U.), is a unit of biological contamination by radioactive substances (specifically [[strontium-90]]). It is equal to one [[Curie|picocurie]] of Sr-90 per [[gram]] of body [[calcium]]. Since about 2% of the human body mass is calcium, and Sr-90 has a [[half-life]] of 28.78 years, releasing 6.697+2.282 [[electronvolt|MeV]] per disintegration, this works out to about 1.065{{e|-12}}&nbsp;[[gray (unit)|gray]]s per second. The permissible body burden was established at 1,000&nbsp;S.U.\n\n===Banana equivalent dose===\n[[File:Bananen Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|A banana contains [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] in the form of [[potassium-40]]]]\nBananas, like most organic material, naturally contain a certain amount of radioactive isotopes\u2014even in the absence of any artificial pollution or contamination. The [[banana equivalent dose]], defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one banana, expresses the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from nuclear weapons or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people. This is approximately 78 nano[[sievert]]s \u2013 in informal publications one often sees this estimate rounded up to 0.1 \u03bcSv.\n\n===Molar mass of cellulose===\nIn the [[pulp and paper]] industry, [[molar mass]] is traditionally measured with a method where the [[intrinsic viscosity]] (dL/g) of the pulp sample is measured in cupriethylenediamine (Cuen). The intrinsic viscosity [\u03b7] is related to the weight-average molar mass (in [[atomic mass unit|dalton]]s) by the [[Mark-Houwink equation]]: [\u03b7] = 0.070 M<sub>w</sub><sup>0.70</sup>.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038|pmid = 23398992|title = A re-investigation of the Mark\u2013Houwink\u2013Sakurada parameters for cellulose in Cuen: A study based on size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering and viscometry|journal = Journal of Chromatography A|volume = 1281|pages = 32\u201337|year = 2013|last1 = Kes|first1 = M\u00fcr\u015fide|last2 = Christensen|first2 = Bj\u00f8rn E.}}</ref> However, it is typical to cite [\u03b7] values directly in dL/g, as the \"viscosity\" of the cellulose, confusingly as it is not a viscosity.\n\n===Iodine, bromine and kappa number===\nIn measuring unsaturation in fatty acids, the traditional method is the [[iodine value|iodine number]]. Iodine adds stoichiometrically to double bonds, so their amount is reported in grams of iodine spent per 100 grams of oil. The standard unit is a dimensionless stoichiometry ratio of moles double bonds to moles fatty acid. A similar quantity, [[bromine number]], is used in gasoline analysis.\n\nIn pulp and paper industry, a similar [[kappa number]] is used to measure how much [[bleaching]] a pulp requires. [[Potassium permanganate]] is added to react with the unsaturated compounds (lignin and uronic acids) in the pulp and back-titrated. Originally with [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine and hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]] the required quantity of [[chlorine]] could be then calculated, although modern methods use multiple stages. Since the oxidizable compounds are not exclusively lignin and the partially pulped lignin does not have a single stoichiometry, the relation between the kappa number and the precise [[amount of substance|amount]] of lignin is inexact.\n\n==Demography and epidemiology==\n[[Demography]] and quantitative [[epidemiology]] are [[statistical]] fields that deal with [[count data|counts]] or proportions of people, or rates of change in these. [[Count data|Counts]] and proportions are technically [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], and so have no [[units of measurement]], although identifiers such as \"people\", \"births\", \"infections\" and the like are used for clarity. Rates of change are [[rate (mathematics)|counts per unit of time]] and strictly have inverse time dimensions (per unit of time). In [[demography#Common Rates and Ratios|demography]] and epidemiology expressions such as [[Mortality rate|\"deaths per year\"]] are used to clarify what is being measured.\n\n[[Prevalence]], a common measure in [[epidemiology]] is strictly a type of [[denominator data]], a dimensionless ratio or proportion. [[Prevalence]] may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage or as the number of cases per 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 in the population of interest.\n\n===Micromort===\n{{Main|Micromort}}\nA micromort is a unit of [[risk]] measuring a one-in-a-million [[probability]] of [[death]] (from [[micro-]] and [[Wikt:mortality|mortality]]). Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A microprobability is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. For example, smoking 1.4 cigarettes increases one's death risk by one micromort, as does traveling {{convert|230|mi|abbr=in|order=flip}} by car.\n\n===Numbers of people: Stadium capacities===\n[[File:AFL Grand Final 2010 on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|To make large numbers of people comprehensible, the capacity of large stadiums is often used. Here the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) is in the process of filling with 100,016 spectators on [[2010 AFL Grand Final|AFL grand final day in 2010]].]]\nThe large numbers of people involved in [[demography]] are often difficult to comprehend. A useful visualisation tool is the audience capacity of large sports stadiums (often about 100,000). Often the capacity of the largest stadium in a region serves as a unit for a large number of people.

Among the ~300 million people in the United States, there are ~300 people struck by lightning annually and ~30 killed, making a lightning strike a one in a million event and a death a one in ten million event; given a mean life expectancy of slightly over 75 years, the chances of an American ever being struck in their lifetime is about 1 in 13,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|title=NWS Lightning Safety Home Page|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|accessdate=27 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308162344/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|archive-date=8 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>\nFor example: \"A person is about 15 times more likely to be struck by lightning in a given year than to be killed by a stranger with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or chronic psychosis\".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gun Violence and Mental Illness|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26341929-gun-violence-and-mental-illness?from_search=true|accessdate=27 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Computer and information science==\nThe growth of computing has necessitated the creation of many new units, several of which are based on unusual foundations.\n\n===Data volume===\n[[File:Print vs. bytes.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio and video clips]]\nVolume or capacity of data is often compared to various famous works of literature or to large collections of writing. Popular units include bibles, encyclopaediae, [[complete works of Shakespeare|the complete works of Shakespeare]], and the [[Library of Congress]].\n\nWhen the [[Compact Disc]] began to be used as a [[data storage device]], the [[CD-ROM]], journalists had to compare the disc capacity (650 [[megabyte]]s) to something everyone could imagine. Since many Western households had a Christian [[Bible]], and the [[Bible]] is a comparatively long [[book]], it was often chosen for this purpose. The [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]] in uncompressed plain 8-bit text contains about 4.5 million characters,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10|title=The Bible, Old and New Testaments, King James Version \u2013 Project Gutenberg|accessdate=7 December 2011}}</ref> so a [[CD-ROM]] can store about 150 [[Bible]]s.\n\nThe print version of the ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' is another common data volume metric. It contains approximately 300 million characters,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|author=John Markoff|title=44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet|accessdate=7 December 2011|date=8 February 1994|work=The New York Times}}</ref> so two copies would fit onto a [[CD-ROM]] and still have 50 megabytes (or about 11 bibles) left over.\n\nThe term ''Library of Congress'' is often used as an unusual unit of measurement to represent an impressively large quantity of [[data (computing)|data]] when discussing [[computer data storage|digital storage]] or [[computer network|networking technologies]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}} It refers to the US [[Library of Congress]]. Information researchers have estimated that the entire print collections of the [[Library of Congress]] represent roughly 10 [[terabyte]]s of uncompressed [[text file|textual data]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/how-much-info.pdf#page=110|author=Peter Lyman|author2=Hal R.

The nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in [[binary-coded decimal]] format, or to represent a single hexadecimal digit. Less commonly, 'nibble' may be used for any contiguous portion of a byte of specified length, e.g. \"6-bit nibble\"; this usage is most likely to be encountered in connection with a hardware architecture in which the word length is not a multiple of 8, such as older 36-bit minicomputers.\n\n===FLOPS===\n{{Main|FLOPS}}\nIn [[computing]], FLOPS (''FL''oating point ''O''perations ''P''er ''S''econd) is a measure of a computer's computing power.

It was invented by [[Linus Torvalds]] and is nowadays present on every [[Linux]] operating system. However, it is not a meaningful measure to assess the actual [[Central processing unit|CPU]] performance.\n\n===KLOC: computer program length===\nA computer programming expression, the [[source lines of code|K-LOC]] or KLOC, pronounced ''kay-lok'', standing for \"kilo-[[source lines of code|lines of code]]\", i.e., thousand lines of code. The unit was used, especially by [[IBM]] managers,<ref>{{cite web | title=Triumph of the Nerds: The Transcripts, Part II | website=PBS | url=https://www.pbs.org/nerds/part2.html | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> to express the amount of work required to develop a piece of software. Given that estimates of 20 lines of functional code per day per programmer were often used, it is apparent that 1 K-LOC could take one programmer as long as 50 working days, or 10 working weeks. This measure is no longer in widespread use because different computer languages require different numbers of lines to achieve the same result (occasionally the measure \"assembly equivalent lines of code\" is used, with appropriate conversion factors from the language actually used to assembly language).\n\nError rates in programming are also measured in \"Errors per K-LOC\", which is called the ''defect density''. NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center#Software Assurance Technology Center|SATC]] is one of the few organisations to claim zero defects in a large (>500K-LOC) project, for the space shuttle software.\n\nAn alternative measurement was defined by [[Pegasus Mail]] author [[David Harris (software developer)|David Harris]]: the \"WaP\" is equivalent to 71,500 lines of program code, because that number of lines is the length of one edition of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=April 2017 \u2013 \"How many WaPs is that?\" | website=Pegasus Mail and Mercury | date=30 November 2011 | url=http://www.pmail.com/devnews_archive.htm | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Ticks===\nThe \"tick\" is the amount of time between timer [[interrupt]]s generated by the timer circuit of a CPU.

The term ''[[ahinsa]]'' means [[nonviolence]], non-injury and absence of desire to harm any life forms. [[Vegetarianism]] and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahimsa.  The Jain concept of ''ahimsa'' is very different from the concept of nonviolence found in other philosophies. Violence is usually associated with causing harm to others. But according to the [[Jain philosophy]], violence refers primarily to injuring one's own self \u2013 behaviour which inhibits the soul's own ability to attain ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (liberation from the cycle of births and deaths).<ref name=\"Jaini 1998 167\">{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=167}}</ref>  At the same time it also means violence to others because it is this tendency to harm others that ultimately harms one's own soul. Furthermore, the Jains extend the concept of ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals, plants, micro-organisms and all beings having life or life potential. All life is sacred and everything has a right to live fearlessly to its maximum potential. Living beings need not fear those who have taken the vow of ''ahimsa''. According to Jainism, protection of life, also known as ''abhayad\u0101nam'', is the supreme charity that a person can make.<ref name=\"Varni, Jinendra 1993\">{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=335}} \"Giving protection always to living beings who are in fear of death is known as abhayadana\"</ref>\n\nAhimsa does not merely indicate absence of physical violence, but also indicates absence of desire to indulge in any sort of violence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=154}} \"Even an intention of killing is the cause of the bondage of Karma, whether you actually kill or not; from the real point of view, this is the nature of the bondage of Karma.\"</ref> Jains have strongly advocated vegetarianism and nonviolence throughout the ages.<ref name=\"Dundas 2002\">{{harvnb|Dundas|2002}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nJain texts expound that there are ten life essentials or life-principles, these are: the five senses, energy, respiration, life-duration, the organ of speech, and the mind.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=34}} Living beings are classified on the basis of their sensory organs ({{IAST|indriya}}) and life essentials ({{IAST|pra\u1e47a}}) they possess. According to Jain texts:{{sfn|S.A.

Ascetics observe these fives vows more strictly and therefore observe complete abstinence.\n\n1. Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost vow. The votary must not to hurt any living being by actions, words or thoughts.{{sfn|Clarke|Beyer|2009|p=325}} The Jain text ''[[Puru\u015f\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya]]'' deals with the conduct required of the householder (''\u015br\u0101vaka'') and therefore discusses the fundamental vow of Ahimsa in detail. There are two types of Ahimsa - Bhaav Ahimsa and Karm Ahimsa. Bhaav Ahimsa is thinking to hurt someone in the thoughts and intentions where as Karm Ahimsa is hurting someone through some actions or words. The text expounds that \"all these subdivisions (injury, falsehood, stealing, unchastity, and attachment) are ''hi\u1e43s\u0101 '' as indulgence in these sullies the pure nature of the soul. Falsehood etc. have been mentioned separately only to make the disciple understand through illustrations.\"{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=33}}\n\n2. ''Satya'' (Truth)- The underlying cause of falsehood is passion and therefore, it is said to cause ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' (injury).{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=66}} According to Jain text ''[[Sarv\u0101rthasiddhi]]'', translates S.A. Jain, \"that which causes pain and suffering to the living is not commendable, whether it refers to actual facts or not is immaterial\".{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=197}}\n\n3. ''Asteya'' (Non-thieving)- According to ''Puru\u015f\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya'':\n{{quote|Driven by passions, taking anything that has not been given be termed as theft and since theft causes injury, it is hi\u1e43s\u0101|''{{IAST|Puru\u015f\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya}}'' (42){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=68}}}}\n\n4. ''Brahmacharya''- It means chastity for householders and celibacy in action, words & thoughts for ascetics.\n{{quote|Unchastity (''abrahma'') is copulation arising from sexual desire. There is all-round injury to the living in copulation and, therefore, it is ''hi\u1e43s\u0101''.|''Puru\u015f\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya''(107){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=71}}}}\n{{quote|Just as a hot rod of iron inserted into a tube filled with sesame seeds burns them up, in the same way, many beings get killed during sexual intercourse|''Puru\u015f\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya'' (108){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=72}}}}\n\n5. ''Aparigraha'' ([[Non-possession]])- According to Jain texts, attachment to possessions (''parigraha'') is of two kinds: attachment to internal possessions (''\u0101bhyantara parigraha''), and attachment to external possessions (''b\u0101hya parigraha'').{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=76}} The fourteen internal possessions are: Wrong belief, the three sex-passions (male sex-passion, female sex-passion, and neuter sex-passion), also the six defects (laughter, liking, disliking, sorrow, fear, and disgust), and four passions (anger, pride, deceitfulness, and greed).{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=77}} According to Jain texts, \"internal possessions are proved to be hi\u1e43s\u0101 as these are just another name for ''hims\u0101''\". External possessions are divided into two sub-classes, the non-living, and the living. \"External possessions, due to the passion of attachment in them, result into ''hims\u0101''.\"{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=77}}\n\n===Ascetic practices for adherence to Ahimsa===\nThese five vows are called ''Mah\u0101vratas'' (major vows) when observed by an ascetic.{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=4}} {{IAST|Ahimsa}} is the first and foremost of all vows. Jain monks and nuns must rank among the most \"nonviolent\" people in the world. A Jain ascetic is expected to uphold the vow of {{IAST|Ahimsa}} to the highest standard, even at the cost of his own life. The other four major vows \u2013 truthfulness, non-stealing, non-possession and celibacy \u2013 are in fact extension of the first vow of complete nonviolence.<ref name=\"Jaini 1998 167\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=368}} \"''Ahimsa'' is the heart of all stages of life, the core of all sacred texts, and the sum ({{IAST|pinda}}) and substance ({{IAST|sara}}) of all vows and virtues.\"</ref>\n\nThe ascetic practices of total renunciation of worldly affairs and possessions, refusal to stay in a single place for a long time, continuous practice of austerities like fasting etc. are geared towards observance of {{IAST|Ahimsa}}. The Jain mendicants abide by a rigorous set of rules of conduct, where they must eat, sleep and even walk with full diligence and with an awareness that even walking kills several hundreds of minute beings. Jain ascetics sweep the ground before them to avoid injuring the most minuscule forms of life. They generally brush the ground clear of insects before they tread. [[Digambara monk]]s do not wear any clothes and eat food only when it is not prepared for themselves. Ascetics of the [[\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara]] tradition wear a small mask to avoid taking in tiny insects. The observation of three {{IAST|guptis}} or the controls of mind, speech and body and five ''samiti'' are designed to help the monks in observing the vow of Ahimsa faultlessly. A monk is required to cultivate the habit of carefulness (''samti''), in respect of the following five particulars:-{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=29}}\n\n#walking, so as not to injure any living being;\n#speech, so as not to cause pain to any one by offensive, disagreeable language, or by a careless use of words having a tendency to incite others to violent deeds;\n#eating, so as not to cause injury to any living being;\n#handling things \u2014 the water gourd, books and the feather whisk, with which there is a great danger of injury to small insects; and\n#evacuation and disposal of faeces, urine, and the like.\n\nThe entire day of a Jain monk is spent in ensuring that he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. This seemingly extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action, no matter however subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' (injury).<ref>{{harvnb|Oldmeadow|2007|p=157}}</ref>\n\n===Householders adherence to the vow===\nA Jain layman, on account of his household and occupational compulsions, is unable to adhere to the five major vows of ascetic. Hence he observes ''a\u1e47uvrata'' or minor vows which although are similar to the major vows of the ascetics are observed with a lesser severity. It is difficult to avoid some violence by a lay person to single-sensed immobile beings in the process of occupation, cooking, self-defense etc. That is why he vows not to kill without a necessary purpose and determined intention, a moving sentient being, when it is innocent. Tying up, injuring, mutilating, burdening with heavy load and depriving from food and drinks any animal or human being, with one's mind polluted by anger and other passions are the five ''{{IAST|atic\u0101ra}}'' or transgressions of the vow of ahimsa.<ref>{{harvnb|Varni||1993|p=310}}</ref> However, it is to be understood that ultimately, there is limited spiritual progress and no emancipation unless the major vows are adhered to.\n\nJainism is perhaps the only religion in the world that requires all its adherents to follow a strict [[vegetarian]] diet.<ref name=\"Huntington\">{{citation  | last =Huntington  | first =Ronald  | title =Jainism and Ethics  | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html  | accessdate =2007-07-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archivedate= 19 August 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use.<ref name=\"Huntington\" /> Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.<ref name=\"Huntington\" />\n\n===Transgressions===\n\nJain text list down five transgressions of the vow of ahimsa:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=103}}\n\n#Tying up animals too tightly,\n#Beating them mercilessly,\n#Cutting their limbs,\n#Overloading them,\n#Neglecting to feed them properly.\n\nA king who fights in defending his empire, however, does not violate the vow of ahimsa, for his motive is to protect his subjects. The same is the case with the judge who punishes to maintain law and order.{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=48}}\n\n==Philosophical overview==\n\n===Important constituents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nWhile Jainism enjoins observance of total nonviolence by the ascetics, it is often argued that the man is constantly obliged to engage in destructive activities of eating, drinking, breathing and surviving in order to support his body. According to Jainism, life is omnipresent with infinite beings including microorganisms pervading each and every part of the universe. Hence it may still be possible to avoid killing of gross animals, but it is impossible to avoid killing of subtle microorganisms in air and water, plant life and various types of insects that may be crushed by walking.\n\nHowever, the Jain conception of ahimsa is quite different from what is commonly understood by violence. The violence is defined more by the motives and the consequences to the self rather than by the act itself. Furthermore, according to Jain Scriptures, destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser ''karmas'' than destruction of developed animals and ''karmas'' generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately. Hence, it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge, even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment.\n\n====Carefulness====\n\nAccording to Jainism, a monk who is careless in his activities is guilty of violence irrespective of whether a living being remains alive or dies; on the other hand, the person who is ever vigilant and careful in observing the ''samitis'' experiences no karmic bondage simply because some violence may have taken place in connection with his activities.<ref>{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=388}}</ref>  Carefulness came to be seen as a defence for the monks against violence in Jainism. ''[[Tattv\u0101rthas\u016btra]]'' defines ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' or violence simply as ''removal of life by careless activity of mind, body and speech.'' Thus action in Jainism came to be regarded as truly violent only when accompanied by carelessness.\n\n====Mental states and intention====\n\nAhimsa does not merely indicate absence of physical violence, but also indicates absence of desire to indulge in any sort of violence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Jains have strongly advocated vegetarianism and nonviolence throughout the ages.<ref name=\"Dundas 2002\"/> Ahimsa being central to the [[Jain philosophy]], Jain \u0100c\u0101ryas have produced, through ages, quite elaborate and detailed doctrinal materials concerning its various aspects.\nPaul Dundas quotes ''\u0100c\u0101rya Jinabhadra'' (7th century), who shows that the omnipresence of life-forms in the universe need not totally inhibit normal behaviour of the ascetics:<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=162}}</ref>\n{{quote|It is the intention that ultimately matters. From the real point of view, a man does not become a killer only because he has killed or because the world is crowded with souls, or remain innocent only because he has not killed physically. Even if a person does not actually kill, he becomes a killer if he has the intention to kill; while a doctor has to cause pain but is still non-violent and innocent because his intention is pure, for it is the intention which is the deciding factor, not the external act which is inconclusive.}}\nThus pure intention along with carefulness was considered necessary to practice {{IAST|Ahimsa}} as Jains admitted that even if intention may be pure, careless activities often resulted in violence unknowingly.\n\n====Knowledge====\nThe Jains also considered right knowledge as a prerequisite for practising {{IAST|Ahimsa}}. It is necessary to know what is living and what is non-living to practice {{IAST|Ahimsa}} faultlessly. A person who is confused between Living and non-living can never observe non-violence. ''Da\u015bavaik\u0101lika S\u016btra'' declared:<ref name=\"Oldmeadow 2007 156\u2013157\">{{harvnb|Oldmeadow|2007|pp=156\u2013157}}</ref>\n{{quote|First knowledge, then compassion. Thus does one remain in full control. How can an ignorant person be compassionate, when he cannot distinguish between the good and the evil?}}\nIt further declares:<ref name=\"Oldmeadow 2007 156\u2013157\"/>\n{{quote|Knowledge of living and non-living alone will enable one to become compassionate towards all living creatures. Knowing this all aspirants, proceed from knowledge to eternal virtues. What can an ignorant do ? How does he know what is noble and what is evil?}}\n\nThe knowledge is also considered necessary to destroy ''[[Karma in Jainism|Karmas]]''. Sama\u1e47 Sutta\u1e41 declared:\n{{quote|The ignorant cannot destroy their ''Karmas'' by their actions while the wise can do it by their inaction i.e. by controlling their activities because they are free from greed and lustful passions and do not commit any sin as they remain contented|165}}\n\n===Anekantavada===\n{{Main|Anekantavada}}\n''Anekantavada'' is the principle of relativity of truth or the doctrine of multiple aspects.<ref>{{harvnb|Varni|1993p=670}} \"One and the same person assumes the relationship of father, son, grandson, nephew and brother, but he is the father of one whose he is and not of the rest (so is the case with all the things).\"</ref> Jains hold that truth is multifaceted and has multiple sides that cannot be completely comprehended by anyone. Anekantavada describes the world as a multifaceted, ever-changing reality with an infinity of viewpoints relative to the time, place, nature and state of one who is the viewer and that which is viewed. What is true from one point of view is open to question from another. Absolute truth cannot be grasped from any particular viewpoint alone, because absolute truth is the sum total of all different viewpoints that make up the universe. Because it is rooted in these doctrines, Jainism cannot exclusively uphold the views of any individual, community, nation, or species.<ref>\n{{citation  | last =Hunter  | first =Alan  | title =Forgiveness in Jainism  | date =May 2003  | url =http://www.coventry.ac.uk/researchnet/external/content/1/c4/08/77/v1170243233/user/jainism.doc  | access-date =4 October 2007  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090411110952/http://www.coventry.ac.uk/researchnet/external/content/1/c4/08/77/v1170243233/user/jainism.doc  | archive-date =11 April 2009  | url-status =dead  | df =dmy-all  }}\n</ref>  It recognises inherently that other views are valid for other peoples, and for other life-forms.  This perception leads to the doctrine of syadvada or sevenfold predication stating the truth from different viewpoints. Anekantvada is the doctrine and [[Syadvada]] is its expression.  According to Jaina philosophers all important philosophical statements should be expressed in this sevenfold way in order to remove the danger of dogmatism (''ekanta'') in philosophy.<ref>{{citation  | last =Koller  | first =John M.  | title =Syadvada as the epistemological key to the Jaina middle way metaphysics of Anekantavada  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =   50  | issue =  3  | pages =400\u2013408  | location =Honolulu  |date=July 2000  | issn =0031-8221 | id ={{ProQuest|216882163}} }}\n</ref>\n\nThe concept of ''syadvada'' allows the Jains to accept the truth in other philosophies from their perspectives, thus inculcating a tolerance for other viewpoints. Anekantvada is non-absolutist and stands firmly against all dogmatisms, even including any assertion that only Jainism is the right religious path.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/>\n\n===Various aspects and consequences of violence===\n\u0100c\u0101rya Am\u1e5btacandra has described as to how the consequences of violence (karmas attracted) differ from person to persons for similar and different types of acts. A small violence may bring serious consequences to one person, while to another person grievous violence may bring about lesser consequences. For instance, a person hunting and killing only one small animal suffers severe consequences while a person who is building a temple or hospital suffers milder karmic consequences even though its construction kills many animals.<ref name=\"JPJAIN\">{{harvnb|Jain, J. P.|2007}}</ref> Even when violence is jointly committed by two persons, the same act may result in severe consequence for one person and mild consequence for another person. This may happen in the case where the leader and planner of violence binds severe ''karmas'', while a follower binds much lesser ''karmas''.<ref name=\"JPJAIN\" /> One who actually does not commit violence may be responsible for ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' while one who actually commits violence is not responsible for hi\u1e43s\u0101. For instance, a burglar who fails in his robbery is still a felon but a diligent surgeon who is trying to save a patient is not responsible for violence even if a patient dies during the surgery.<ref name=\"JPJAIN\" /> Persons who have not committed violence may become responsible for violence committed by others. This may happen when a violence which is carried out by someone is approved and instigated by someone else.<ref name=\"JPJAIN\" /> {{IAST|Ahimsa}} often gives result of ''himsa'' to one and ''himsa'' may sometimes give result of ''ahimsa'' to another. For instance, one person saves another from oppression by use of violence and hence enjoys consequences of ''ahimsa'' although resorting to violence, while another does not act to save someone wishing that the other person is not saved and thus suffers the consequences of violence although he may have not actually done anything.<ref name=\"JPJAIN\" />\n\n==={{IAST|Dravya hi\u1e43s\u0101}} and {{IAST|bh\u0101va hi\u1e43s\u0101}}===\n\n===Types of violence===\nWhile the Jain ascetics observe absolute nonviolence, so far as a Jain householder is concerned, the violence is categorised as follows:\n#'''{{IAST|Sankalpin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} or intentional violence''' \u2013 Intentional violence knowingly done is the worst form of violence and is a transgression of the layperson's vow of nonviolence. Examples of {{IAST|sankalpin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} are killing for hunting, amusement or decoration, or butchering for food or sacrifice or killing or hurting out of enmity, malice or mischief. {{IAST|sankalpin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} has to be totally renounced by a householder.<ref name=\"bhatt\">{{harvnb|Dr. Bhattacharya, H. S.|1976}}</ref>\n#'''{{IAST|Virodhin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} or Self-defence''' \u2013 One is allowed to practice self-defense against a robber, murderer, or any other criminal. This self-defense is necessary when evil attacks.<ref name=\"bhatt\"/>\n#'''{{IAST|\u0100\u1e5bambhin\u012b (Graharambhi) hi\u1e43s\u0101}} or domestic or household violence '''\u2013 This violence is unavoidably committed in the course of preparing food, household cleanliness, washing, construction of houses, wells, etc.<ref name=\"bhatt\"/>\n#'''{{IAST|Udyogin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} or Occupational Violence''' \u2013 This violence is connected to occupational undertakings like agriculture, building and operating industries, etc.<ref name=\"bhatt\"/>\n:While {{IAST|sankalpin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} has to be avoided at all costs, the other three types of hi\u1e43s\u0101, although unavoidable in some cases, should not exceed the strict requirements of fulfilling the duties of a householder. Furthermore, they should not be influenced by passions such as anger, greed, pride and deceit or they take the character of {{IAST|sanpalkin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}}.<ref name=\"bhatt\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Ways of committing Violence}}Ways of committing violence===\n[[File:Depiction of Violence Gujarat.jpg|thumb|500px|Violence (Himsa) gouache on paper, 17th century, Gujarat depicts animals of prey with their victims. The princely couple symbolises love, which is another occasion of violence.]]\nIt would be wrong, however, to conclude that {{IAST|Ahimsa}} only prohibits physical violence. An early Jain text says: \"With the three means of punishment \u2013 thoughts, words, deeds \u2013 ye shall not injure living beings.\" <ref name=\"Huntington\" /> In fact, violence can be committed by combination of the following four factors:\n\n1. The instrumentality of our actions. We can commit violence through\n:a. body i.e. physical action,\n:b. speech i.e. verbal action, or\n:c. mind i.e. mental actions\n2. The process of committing violence. This includes whether\n:a. we only decide or plan to act,\n:b. we make preparations for the act e.g. like collecting necessary materials or weapons, or\n:c. we actually begin the action\n3. The modality of our action, whether\n:a. we ourselves commit violence,\n:b. we instigate others to carry out the violence, or\n:c. we give our silent approval for the violence\n4. The motivation for action. This includes which of the following negative emotions motivate the violence.\n:a. Anger\n:b. Greed\n:c. Pride\n:d. Manipulation or deceit\n\nIn Jainism, \"non-manifestation of passions like attachment is non-injury (''Ahimsa''), and manifestation of such passions is injury (''himsa'').\" This is termed as the essence of the Jaina Scriptures.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=35}}\n\n==The rationale of nonviolence==\n[[File:Ahinsa.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicting the statement \"''ahims\u0101 paramo dharma''\" (Photo:[[Ahinsa Sthal]], Delhi)]]\nAccording to Jainism, the purpose of nonviolence is not because it is a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its observance is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community.<ref name =\"bhatt\" /> While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arhats]] who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.<ref name=\"bhatt\" />\n\nAnother aspect that provides a rationale to the avoidance of ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' is that, any acts of ''hims\u0101'' results in ''hims\u0101'' to self. Any act of violence though outwardly is seen to harm others, harms the soul of the person indulging in the act. Thus by an act of violence, a soul may or may not injure the material vitalities known as {{IAST|dravya pra\u1e47a}} of someone else, but always causes injury to its own ''bh\u0101va pra\u1e47a'' or the psychic vitalities by binding the soul with ''karmas''. It would be entirely wrong to see Ahimsa in Jainism in any sentimental light.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/>  The Jain doctrine of non-injury is based on rational consciousness, not emotional compassion; on responsibility to self, not on a social fellow feeling. The motive of {{IAST|Ahimsa}} is totally self-centered and for the benefit of the individual. And yet, though the emphasis is on personal liberation, the Jain ethics makes that goal attainable only through consideration for others.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Jain karmic theory, each and every soul, including self, has reincarnated as an animal, plant or microorganism innumerable number of times besides re-incarnated as humans. The concept of {{IAST|Ahimsa}} is more meaningful when understood in conjunction with the concept of karmas. As the doctrine of transmigration of souls includes rebirth in animal as well as human form, it creates a humanitarian sentiment of kinship amongst all life forms.<ref>{{harvnb|Patil, Bal|2006}}</ref>  The motto of Jainism \u2013 {{IAST|''[[Parasparopagraho Jivanam|Parasparopagraho j\u012bv\u0101n\u0101m]]''}}, translated as: ''all life is inter-related and it is the duty of souls to assist each other''- also provides a rational approach of Jains towards Ahimsa.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn conclusion, the insistence of ahimsa is not so much about non-injury to others as it is about non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The ultimate rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its own sake.<ref>{{harvnb|Jan E.

It is considered one of the most rigorous forms of a spiritually motivated diet on the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The Jain cuisine is completely vegetarian, and it also excludes potatoes, onions and garlic, like the [[shojin-ryori]] cuisine of Japan.\n\nAccording to Am\u1e5btacandra S\u016bri:\n{{quote|\"Those who wish to renounce hi\u1e43s\u0101 must, first of all, make effort to give up the consumption of wine, flesh, honey, and the five ''udumbara'' fruits (the five udumbara trees are Gular, Anjeera, Banyan, Peepal, and Pakar, all belonging to the fig class).|''{{IAST|Puru\u1e63\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya}}'' (61){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=44}}}}\n\nThe strictest forms of Jain diet are practised by the monastic ascetics.

They often oppose the Vedic beliefs in sacrifices and other practices that justified violence in various ways. ''\u0100c\u0101rya Amritacandra's Puru\u1e63\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya'' discuss these wrong beliefs at length to alert the Jain laity to them. These misconceptions are as follows.\n\n===Animal sacrifices===\nThe belief that animals were created for [[yajna]] (sacrifice) and hence it was not considered a slaughter, as it elevated not only the person making the sacrifice, but also the animals was also denounced by the Jains. {{IAST|\u0100c\u0101rya}} Am\u1e5btacandra of {{IAST|Puru\u1e63\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya}} condemned this practice by stating that it is a misconception to hold that Gods are pleased at sacrifices of living beings and there is no wrong in committing hi\u1e43s\u0101 for the sake of religion.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=55}}\n\n{{IAST|\u0100c\u0101rya}} Am\u1e5btacandra says that animals should not be killed for guests or persons deserving respect as often advocated in certain scriptures.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=56}} It is also a wrong belief that wild animals that kill many other animals should be killed.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=57}} This is often justified in the name of hunting of ferocious animals like tigers for sport. Another wrong belief forwarded to justify killing of ferocious animals is that, these kill many lives and accumulate grave sins and hence killing them is an act of mercy. According to Jainism, killing can never be an act of mercy. It is also a misconception to believe that it is advisable to kill those who are suffering so that they may get relief from agony. These sorts of arguments are forwarded to justify killing of those animals that may have become old or injured and hence have become commercially useless.\n\n===Wrong Beliefs===\nOther wrong beliefs are killing those who are in state of happiness or those who are in meditation under wrong belief that the mental state at the time of death will be perpetuated in future lives. It is also a wrong belief that killing of self and others is justified as the soul that is imprisoned in the body will be permanently released and achieve salvation.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=58\u201359}}\n\n==Fruits of nonviolence==\n{{Main|Karma in Jainism}}\nAccording to Jain texts, the fruits of ''hims\u0101'' (violence) depends upon the severity of passions at the time of commencement of such an act.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=38}} One may be responsible for the sinful act of ''hims\u0101'' without actually causing injury; the other, while having caused injury, may not be responsible for the act.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=39}} Also, when two persons commit the act of ''hims\u0101'' jointly, its consequences on fruition (of ''karma'') may be grave for one person and mild for the other.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=40}}\n\nAccording to Jains, the consequences of karma are inevitable. The consequences may take some time to take effect but the ''karma'' is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions\u2014like proper time, place, and environment\u2014to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.<ref name=\"real\">{{harvnb|Bhattacharya, Harisatya|1966|p=197}}</ref>\n\n==Appreciation==\n{{IAST|Ahimsa}}, an important tenet of all the religions originating in India, is now considered as an article of faith by the adherents of the [[Indian religions]].\n\nMahatma Gandhi was of the view:{{quote|No religion in the World has explained the principle of Ahimsa so deeply and systematically as is discussed with its applicability in every human life in Jainism.

The term ''[[ahinsa]]'' means [[nonviolence]], non-injury and absence of desire to harm any life forms. [[Vegetarianism]] and other nonviolent practices and rituals of Jains flow from the principle of ahimsa.  The Jain concept of ''ahimsa'' is very different from the concept of nonviolence found in other philosophies. Violence is usually associated with causing harm to others. But according to the [[Jain philosophy]], violence refers primarily to injuring one's own self \u2013 behaviour which inhibits the soul's own ability to attain ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' (liberation from the cycle of births and deaths).<ref name=\"Jaini 1998 167\">{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=167}}</ref>  At the same time it also means violence to others because it is this tendency to harm others that ultimately harms one's own soul. Furthermore, the Jains extend the concept of ahimsa not only to humans but to all animals, plants, micro-organisms and all beings having life or life potential. All life is sacred and everything has a right to live fearlessly to its maximum potential. Living beings need not fear those who have taken the vow of ''ahimsa''. According to Jainism, protection of life, also known as ''abhayad\u0101nam'', is the supreme charity that a person can make.<ref name=\"Varni, Jinendra 1993\">{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=335}} \"Giving protection always to living beings who are in fear of death is known as abhayadana\"</ref>\n\nAhimsa does not merely indicate absence of physical violence, but also indicates absence of desire to indulge in any sort of violence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=154}} \"Even an intention of killing is the cause of the bondage of Karma, whether you actually kill or not; from the real point of view, this is the nature of the bondage of Karma.\"</ref> Jains have strongly advocated vegetarianism and nonviolence throughout the ages.<ref name=\"Dundas 2002\">{{harvnb|Dundas|2002}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nJain texts expound that there are ten life essentials or life-principles, these are: the five senses, energy, respiration, life-duration, the organ of speech, and the mind.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=34}} Living beings are classified on the basis of their sensory organs ({{IAST|indriya}}) and life essentials ({{IAST|pra\u1e47a}}) they possess. According to Jain texts :{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|pp=62, 63, 196}}\n*The one-sensed lives possess four essentials \u2013 sense organ of touch, strength of body or energy, respiration, and life-duration.\n*The two-sensed beings have six, namely the sense of taste and the organ of speech in addition to the former four.\n*The three-sensed beings have seven with the addition of the sense of smell.\n*The four-sensed beings have eight with the addition of the sense of sight.\n*The five- sensed beings without mind have nine life-principles with the addition of the sense of hearing. Those endowed with mind are said to have ten vitalities with the addition of the mind.\n\nAccording to ''[[Tattvarthasutra]]'', one of the most important Jainism scriptures, \"the severance of vitalities out of passion is injury\".{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=99}} Therefore, the higher the number of senses and vitalities a being has, the more is its capacity to suffer and feel pain. Hence according to Jainism, violence to higher-sensed beings like man, cow, tiger and those who have five senses and the capacity to think and feel pain attracts more ''karma'' than violence to lesser-sensed beings like insects, or single-sensed beings like microbes and plants.<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=161}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Jaini|1998|p=168}}</ref>\nOut of the five types of living beings, a householder is forbidden to kill, or destroy, intentionally, all except the lowest (the one sensed, such as vegetables, herbs, cereals, etc., which are endowed with only the sense of touch).{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=49}} But, the ascetic is required to avoid even injuring the one-sensed form of life to the best of his ability.{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=55}}\n\nHence Jainism enjoins its adherents to completely avoid violence to higher-sensed beings and as far as possible minimise violence to lower-sensed and single-sensed beings.\n\nJains agree with Hindus that violence in self-defence can be justified,<ref>''Nisithabhasya'' (in ''Nisithasutra'') 289; Jinadatta Suri: ''Upadesharasayana'' 26; Dundas pp. 162\u2013163; T\u00e4htinen p. 31.</ref> and they agree that a soldier who kills enemies in combat is performing a legitimate duty.<ref>Jindal pp. 89\u201390; Laidlaw pp. 154\u2013155; Jaini, Padmanabh S.: ''Ahimsa and \"Just War\" in Jainism'', in: ''Ahimsa, Anekanta and Jainism'', ed.

Ascetics observe these fives vows more strictly and therefore observe complete abstinence.\n\n1. Ahimsa is formalised into Jain doctrine as the first and foremost vow. The votary must not to hurt any living being by actions, words or thoughts.{{sfn|Clarke|Beyer|2009|p=325}} The Jain text ''[[Puru\u015f\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya]]'' deals with the conduct required of the householder (''\u015br\u0101vaka'') and therefore discusses the fundamental vow of Ahimsa in detail. There are two types of Ahimsa - Bhaav Ahimsa and Karm Ahimsa. Bhaav Ahimsa is thinking to hurt someone in the thoughts and intentions where as Karm Ahimsa is hurting someone through some actions or words. The text expounds that \"all these subdivisions (injury, falsehood, stealing, unchastity, and attachment) are ''hi\u1e43s\u0101 '' as indulgence in these sullies the pure nature of the soul. Falsehood etc. have been mentioned separately only to make the disciple understand through illustrations.\"{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=33}}\n\n2. ''Satya'' (Truth)- The underlying cause of falsehood is passion and therefore, it is said to cause ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' (injury).{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=66}} According to Jain text ''[[Sarv\u0101rthasiddhi]]'', translates S.A. Jain, \"that which causes pain and suffering to the living is not commendable, whether it refers to actual facts or not is immaterial\".{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=197}}\n\n3. ''Asteya'' (Non-thieving)- According to ''Puru\u015f\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya'':\n{{quote|Driven by passions, taking anything that has not been given be termed as theft and since theft causes injury, it is hi\u1e43s\u0101|''{{IAST|Puru\u015f\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya}}'' (42){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=68}}}}\n\n4. ''Brahmacharya''- It means chastity for householders and celibacy in action, words & thoughts for ascetics.\n{{quote|Unchastity (''abrahma'') is copulation arising from sexual desire. There is all-round injury to the living in copulation and, therefore, it is ''hi\u1e43s\u0101''.|''Puru\u015f\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya''(107){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=71}}}}\n{{quote|Just as a hot rod of iron inserted into a tube filled with sesame seeds burns them up, in the same way, many beings get killed during sexual intercourse|''Puru\u015f\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya'' (108){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=72}}}}\n\n5. ''Aparigraha'' ([[Non-possession]])- According to Jain texts, attachment to possessions (''parigraha'') is of two kinds: attachment to internal possessions (''\u0101bhyantara parigraha''), and attachment to external possessions (''b\u0101hya parigraha'').{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=76}} The fourteen internal possessions are: Wrong belief, the three sex-passions (male sex-passion, female sex-passion, and neuter sex-passion), also the six defects (laughter, liking, disliking, sorrow, fear, and disgust), and four passions (anger, pride, deceitfulness, and greed).{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=77}} According to Jain texts, \"internal possessions are proved to be hi\u1e43s\u0101 as these are just another name for ''hims\u0101''\". External possessions are divided into two sub-classes, the non-living, and the living. \"External possessions, due to the passion of attachment in them, result into ''hims\u0101''.\"{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=77}}\n\n===Ascetic practices for adherence to Ahimsa===\nThese five vows are called ''Mah\u0101vratas'' (major vows) when observed by an ascetic.{{sfn|Tukol|1976|p=4}} {{IAST|Ahimsa}} is the first and foremost of all vows. Jain monks and nuns must rank among the most \"nonviolent\" people in the world. A Jain ascetic is expected to uphold the vow of {{IAST|Ahimsa}} to the highest standard, even at the cost of his own life. The other four major vows \u2013 truthfulness, non-stealing, non-possession and celibacy \u2013 are in fact extension of the first vow of complete nonviolence.<ref name=\"Jaini 1998 167\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=368}} \"''Ahimsa'' is the heart of all stages of life, the core of all sacred texts, and the sum ({{IAST|pinda}}) and substance ({{IAST|sara}}) of all vows and virtues.\"</ref>\n\nThe ascetic practices of total renunciation of worldly affairs and possessions, refusal to stay in a single place for a long time, continuous practice of austerities like fasting etc. are geared towards observance of {{IAST|Ahimsa}}. The Jain mendicants abide by a rigorous set of rules of conduct, where they must eat, sleep and even walk with full diligence and with an awareness that even walking kills several hundreds of minute beings. Jain ascetics sweep the ground before them to avoid injuring the most minuscule forms of life. They generally brush the ground clear of insects before they tread. [[Digambara monk]]s do not wear any clothes and eat food only when it is not prepared for themselves. Ascetics of the [[\u015av\u0113t\u0101mbara]] tradition wear a small mask to avoid taking in tiny insects. The observation of three {{IAST|guptis}} or the controls of mind, speech and body and five ''samiti'' are designed to help the monks in observing the vow of Ahimsa faultlessly. A monk is required to cultivate the habit of carefulness (''samti''), in respect of the following five particulars:-{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=29}}\n\n#walking, so as not to injure any living being;\n#speech, so as not to cause pain to any one by offensive, disagreeable language, or by a careless use of words having a tendency to incite others to violent deeds;\n#eating, so as not to cause injury to any living being;\n#handling things \u2014 the water gourd, books and the feather whisk, with which there is a great danger of injury to small insects; and\n#evacuation and disposal of faeces, urine, and the like.\n\nThe entire day of a Jain monk is spent in ensuring that he observes his vow of ahimsa through mind, body and speech faultlessly. This seemingly extreme behaviour of the monks comes from a sense that every action, no matter however subtle, has a karmic effect which can bind soul and inhibit liberation, especially those that result in ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' (injury).<ref>{{harvnb|Oldmeadow|2007|p=157}}</ref>\n\n===Householders adherence to the vow===\nA Jain layman, on account of his household and occupational compulsions, is unable to adhere to the five major vows of ascetic. Hence he observes ''a\u1e47uvrata'' or minor vows which although are similar to the major vows of the ascetics are observed with a lesser severity. It is difficult to avoid some violence by a lay person to single-sensed immobile beings in the process of occupation, cooking, self-defense etc. That is why he vows not to kill without a necessary purpose and determined intention, a moving sentient being, when it is innocent. Tying up, injuring, mutilating, burdening with heavy load and depriving from food and drinks any animal or human being, with one's mind polluted by anger and other passions are the five ''{{IAST|atic\u0101ra}}'' or transgressions of the vow of ahimsa.<ref>{{harvnb|Varni||1993|p=310}}</ref> However, it is to be understood that ultimately, there is limited spiritual progress and no emancipation unless the major vows are adhered to.\n\nJainism is perhaps the only religion in the world that requires all its adherents to follow a strict [[vegetarian]] diet.<ref name=\"Huntington\">{{citation  | last =Huntington  | first =Ronald  | title =Jainism and Ethics  | url =http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html  | accessdate =2007-07-18| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070819191651/http://www1.chapman.edu/schweitzer/huntington.html| archivedate= 19 August 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> Vegetarian food that also involves more harm to the living beings such as roots, bulbs, multi seeded vegetables etc. are avoided by strict Jains. The importance of ahimsa manifests in many other ways in the daily life of Jains. For a layperson it means participating in business that results in least amount of violence to living beings. No furs, plumes or silk are worn. Use of leather is kept to a minimum and must in any event be from naturally dead animals. Food is usually eaten during the day unless unavoidable, since there is too much danger of injuring insects in cooking at night. The Jain will not use an open light nor leave a container of liquid uncovered lest a stray insect be destroyed; even with this precaution, liquids are always strained before use.<ref name=\"Huntington\" /> Through the ages Jains have sought to avoid occupations that unavoidably entail injury, and this accounts for the disproportionate number who have entered banking, commerce and other mercantile trades.<ref name=\"Huntington\" />\n\n===Transgressions===\n\nJain text list down five transgressions of the vow of ahimsa:{{sfn|Jain|2011|p=103}}\n\n#Tying up animals too tightly,\n#Beating them mercilessly,\n#Cutting their limbs,\n#Overloading them,\n#Neglecting to feed them properly.\n\nA king who fights in defending his empire, however, does not violate the vow of ahimsa, for his motive is to protect his subjects. The same is the case with the judge who punishes to maintain law and order.{{sfn|Jain|1929|p=48}}\n\n==Philosophical overview==\n\n===Important constituents===\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2015}}\nWhile Jainism enjoins observance of total nonviolence by the ascetics, it is often argued that the man is constantly obliged to engage in destructive activities of eating, drinking, breathing and surviving in order to support his body. According to Jainism, life is omnipresent with infinite beings including microorganisms pervading each and every part of the universe. Hence it may still be possible to avoid killing of gross animals, but it is impossible to avoid killing of subtle microorganisms in air and water, plant life and various types of insects that may be crushed by walking.\n\nHowever, the Jain conception of ahimsa is quite different from what is commonly understood by violence. The violence is defined more by the motives and the consequences to the self rather than by the act itself. Furthermore, according to Jain Scriptures, destruction of less developed organism brings about lesser ''karmas'' than destruction of developed animals and ''karmas'' generated in observance of religious duties faultlessly disappears almost immediately. Hence, it is possible to observe complete nonviolence with right knowledge, even when some outward violence occurs to living beings in the course of performing religious duties by observing carefulness and pure mental disposition without any attachment.\n\n====Carefulness====\n\nAccording to Jainism, a monk who is careless in his activities is guilty of violence irrespective of whether a living being remains alive or dies; on the other hand, the person who is ever vigilant and careful in observing the ''samitis'' experiences no karmic bondage simply because some violence may have taken place in connection with his activities.<ref>{{harvnb|Varni|1993|p=388}}</ref>  Carefulness came to be seen as a defence for the monks against violence in Jainism. ''[[Tattv\u0101rthas\u016btra]]'' defines ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' or violence simply as ''removal of life by careless activity of mind, body and speech.'' Thus action in Jainism came to be regarded as truly violent only when accompanied by carelessness.\n\n====Mental states and intention====\n\nAhimsa does not merely indicate absence of physical violence, but also indicates absence of desire to indulge in any sort of violence.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Jains have strongly advocated vegetarianism and nonviolence throughout the ages.<ref name=\"Dundas 2002\"/> Ahimsa being central to the [[Jain philosophy]], Jain \u0100c\u0101ryas have produced, through ages, quite elaborate and detailed doctrinal materials concerning its various aspects.\nPaul Dundas quotes ''\u0100c\u0101rya Jinabhadra'' (7th century), who shows that the omnipresence of life-forms in the universe need not totally inhibit normal behaviour of the ascetics:<ref>{{harvnb|Dundas|2002|p=162}}</ref>\n{{quote|It is the intention that ultimately matters. From the real point of view, a man does not become a killer only because he has killed or because the world is crowded with souls, or remain innocent only because he has not killed physically. Even if a person does not actually kill, he becomes a killer if he has the intention to kill; while a doctor has to cause pain but is still non-violent and innocent because his intention is pure, for it is the intention which is the deciding factor, not the external act which is inconclusive.}}\nThus pure intention along with carefulness was considered necessary to practice {{IAST|Ahimsa}} as Jains admitted that even if intention may be pure, careless activities often resulted in violence unknowingly.\n\n====Knowledge====\nThe Jains also considered right knowledge as a prerequisite for practising {{IAST|Ahimsa}}. It is necessary to know what is living and what is non-living to practice {{IAST|Ahimsa}} faultlessly. A person who is confused between Living and non-living can never observe non-violence. ''Da\u015bavaik\u0101lika S\u016btra'' declared:<ref name=\"Oldmeadow 2007 156\u2013157\">{{harvnb|Oldmeadow|2007|pp=156\u2013157}}</ref>\n{{quote|First knowledge, then compassion. Thus does one remain in full control. How can an ignorant person be compassionate, when he cannot distinguish between the good and the evil?}}\nIt further declares:<ref name=\"Oldmeadow 2007 156\u2013157\"/>\n{{quote|Knowledge of living and non-living alone will enable one to become compassionate towards all living creatures. Knowing this all aspirants, proceed from knowledge to eternal virtues. What can an ignorant do ? How does he know what is noble and what is evil?}}\n\nThe knowledge is also considered necessary to destroy ''[[Karma in Jainism|Karmas]]''. Sama\u1e47 Sutta\u1e41 declared:\n{{quote|The ignorant cannot destroy their ''Karmas'' by their actions while the wise can do it by their inaction i.e. by controlling their activities because they are free from greed and lustful passions and do not commit any sin as they remain contented|165}}\n\n===Anekantavada===\n{{Main|Anekantavada}}\n''Anekantavada'' is the principle of relativity of truth or the doctrine of multiple aspects.<ref>{{harvnb|Varni|1993p=670}} \"One and the same person assumes the relationship of father, son, grandson, nephew and brother, but he is the father of one whose he is and not of the rest (so is the case with all the things).\"</ref> Jains hold that truth is multifaceted and has multiple sides that cannot be completely comprehended by anyone. Anekantavada describes the world as a multifaceted, ever-changing reality with an infinity of viewpoints relative to the time, place, nature and state of one who is the viewer and that which is viewed. What is true from one point of view is open to question from another. Absolute truth cannot be grasped from any particular viewpoint alone, because absolute truth is the sum total of all different viewpoints that make up the universe. Because it is rooted in these doctrines, Jainism cannot exclusively uphold the views of any individual, community, nation, or species.<ref>\n{{citation  | last =Hunter  | first =Alan  | title =Forgiveness in Jainism  | date =May 2003  | url =http://www.coventry.ac.uk/researchnet/external/content/1/c4/08/77/v1170243233/user/jainism.doc  | access-date =4 October 2007  | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20090411110952/http://www.coventry.ac.uk/researchnet/external/content/1/c4/08/77/v1170243233/user/jainism.doc  | archive-date =11 April 2009  | url-status =dead  | df =dmy-all  }}\n</ref>  It recognises inherently that other views are valid for other peoples, and for other life-forms.  This perception leads to the doctrine of syadvada or sevenfold predication stating the truth from different viewpoints. Anekantvada is the doctrine and [[Syadvada]] is its expression.  According to Jaina philosophers all important philosophical statements should be expressed in this sevenfold way in order to remove the danger of dogmatism (''ekanta'') in philosophy.<ref>{{citation  | last =Koller  | first =John M.  | title =Syadvada as the epistemological key to the Jaina middle way metaphysics of Anekantavada  | journal =Philosophy East and West  | volume =   50  | issue =  3  | pages =400\u2013408  | location =Honolulu  |date=July 2000  | issn =0031-8221 | id ={{ProQuest|216882163}} }}\n</ref>\n\nThe concept of ''syadvada'' allows the Jains to accept the truth in other philosophies from their perspectives, thus inculcating a tolerance for other viewpoints. Anekantvada is non-absolutist and stands firmly against all dogmatisms, even including any assertion that only Jainism is the right religious path.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/>\n\n===Various aspects and consequences of violence===\n\u0100c\u0101rya Am\u1e5btacandra has described as to how the consequences of violence (karmas attracted) differ from person to persons for similar and different types of acts. A small violence may bring serious consequences to one person, while to another person grievous violence may bring about lesser consequences. For instance, a person hunting and killing only one small animal suffers severe consequences while a person who is building a temple or hospital suffers milder karmic consequences even though its construction kills many animals.<ref name=\"JPJAIN\">{{harvnb|Jain, J. P.|2007}}</ref> Even when violence is jointly committed by two persons, the same act may result in severe consequence for one person and mild consequence for another person. This may happen in the case where the leader and planner of violence binds severe ''karmas'', while a follower binds much lesser ''karmas''.<ref name=\"JPJAIN\" /> One who actually does not commit violence may be responsible for ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' while one who actually commits violence is not responsible for hi\u1e43s\u0101. For instance, a burglar who fails in his robbery is still a felon but a diligent surgeon who is trying to save a patient is not responsible for violence even if a patient dies during the surgery.<ref name=\"JPJAIN\" /> Persons who have not committed violence may become responsible for violence committed by others. This may happen when a violence which is carried out by someone is approved and instigated by someone else.<ref name=\"JPJAIN\" /> {{IAST|Ahimsa}} often gives result of ''himsa'' to one and ''himsa'' may sometimes give result of ''ahimsa'' to another. For instance, one person saves another from oppression by use of violence and hence enjoys consequences of ''ahimsa'' although resorting to violence, while another does not act to save someone wishing that the other person is not saved and thus suffers the consequences of violence although he may have not actually done anything.<ref name=\"JPJAIN\" />\n\n==={{IAST|Dravya hi\u1e43s\u0101}} and {{IAST|bh\u0101va hi\u1e43s\u0101}}===\n\n===Types of violence===\nWhile the Jain ascetics observe absolute nonviolence, so far as a Jain householder is concerned, the violence is categorised as follows:\n#'''{{IAST|Sankalpin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} or intentional violence''' \u2013 Intentional violence knowingly done is the worst form of violence and is a transgression of the layperson's vow of nonviolence. Examples of {{IAST|sankalpin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} are killing for hunting, amusement or decoration, or butchering for food or sacrifice or killing or hurting out of enmity, malice or mischief. {{IAST|sankalpin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} has to be totally renounced by a householder.<ref name=\"bhatt\">{{harvnb|Dr. Bhattacharya, H. S.|1976}}</ref>\n#'''{{IAST|Virodhin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} or Self-defence''' \u2013 One is allowed to practice self-defense against a robber, murderer, or any other criminal. This self-defense is necessary when evil attacks.<ref name=\"bhatt\"/>\n#'''{{IAST|\u0100\u1e5bambhin\u012b (Graharambhi) hi\u1e43s\u0101}} or domestic or household violence '''\u2013 This violence is unavoidably committed in the course of preparing food, household cleanliness, washing, construction of houses, wells, etc.<ref name=\"bhatt\"/>\n#'''{{IAST|Udyogin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} or Occupational Violence''' \u2013 This violence is connected to occupational undertakings like agriculture, building and operating industries, etc.<ref name=\"bhatt\"/>\n:While {{IAST|sankalpin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}} has to be avoided at all costs, the other three types of hi\u1e43s\u0101, although unavoidable in some cases, should not exceed the strict requirements of fulfilling the duties of a householder. Furthermore, they should not be influenced by passions such as anger, greed, pride and deceit or they take the character of {{IAST|sanpalkin\u012b hi\u1e43s\u0101}}.<ref name=\"bhatt\"/>\n\n==={{anchor|Ways of committing Violence}}Ways of committing violence===\n[[File:Depiction of Violence Gujarat.jpg|thumb|500px|Violence (Himsa) gouache on paper, 17th century, Gujarat depicts animals of prey with their victims. The princely couple symbolises love, which is another occasion of violence.]]\nIt would be wrong, however, to conclude that {{IAST|Ahimsa}} only prohibits physical violence. An early Jain text says: \"With the three means of punishment \u2013 thoughts, words, deeds \u2013 ye shall not injure living beings.\" <ref name=\"Huntington\" /> In fact, violence can be committed by combination of the following four factors:\n\n1. The instrumentality of our actions. We can commit violence through\n:a. body i.e. physical action,\n:b. speech i.e. verbal action, or\n:c. mind i.e. mental actions\n2. The process of committing violence. This includes whether\n:a. we only decide or plan to act,\n:b. we make preparations for the act e.g. like collecting necessary materials or weapons, or\n:c. we actually begin the action\n3. The modality of our action, whether\n:a. we ourselves commit violence,\n:b. we instigate others to carry out the violence, or\n:c. we give our silent approval for the violence\n4. The motivation for action. This includes which of the following negative emotions motivate the violence.\n:a. Anger\n:b. Greed\n:c. Pride\n:d. Manipulation or deceit\n\nIn Jainism, \"non-manifestation of passions like attachment is non-injury (''Ahimsa''), and manifestation of such passions is injury (''himsa'').\" This is termed as the essence of the Jaina Scriptures.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=35}}\n\n==The rationale of nonviolence==\n[[File:Ahinsa.jpg|thumb|Sculpture depicting the statement \"''ahims\u0101 paramo dharma''\" (Photo:[[Ahinsa Sthal]], Delhi)]]\nAccording to Jainism, the purpose of nonviolence is not because it is a commandment of a God or any other supreme being. Its purpose is also not simply because its observance is conducive to general welfare of the state or the community.<ref name =\"bhatt\" /> While it is true that in Jainism, the moral and religious injunctions were laid down as law by [[Arihant (Jainism)|Arhats]] who have achieved perfection through their supreme moral efforts, their adherence is just not to please a God, but the life of the Arhats has demonstrated that such commandments were conductive to Arhat's own welfare, helping him to reach spiritual victory. Just as Arhats achieved spiritual victory by observing non-violence, so can anyone who follows this path.<ref name=\"bhatt\" />\n\nAnother aspect that provides a rationale to the avoidance of ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' is that, any acts of ''hims\u0101'' results in ''hims\u0101'' to self. Any act of violence though outwardly is seen to harm others, harms the soul of the person indulging in the act. Thus by an act of violence, a soul may or may not injure the material vitalities known as {{IAST|dravya pra\u1e47a}} of someone else, but always causes injury to its own ''bh\u0101va pra\u1e47a'' or the psychic vitalities by binding the soul with ''karmas''. It would be entirely wrong to see Ahimsa in Jainism in any sentimental light.<ref name=\"Huntington\"/>  The Jain doctrine of non-injury is based on rational consciousness, not emotional compassion; on responsibility to self, not on a social fellow feeling. The motive of {{IAST|Ahimsa}} is totally self-centered and for the benefit of the individual. And yet, though the emphasis is on personal liberation, the Jain ethics makes that goal attainable only through consideration for others.\n\nFurthermore, according to the Jain karmic theory, each and every soul, including self, has reincarnated as an animal, plant or microorganism innumerable number of times besides re-incarnated as humans. The concept of {{IAST|Ahimsa}} is more meaningful when understood in conjunction with the concept of karmas. As the doctrine of transmigration of souls includes rebirth in animal as well as human form, it creates a humanitarian sentiment of kinship amongst all life forms.<ref>{{harvnb|Patil, Bal|2006}}</ref>  The motto of Jainism \u2013 {{IAST|''[[Parasparopagraho Jivanam|Parasparopagraho j\u012bv\u0101n\u0101m]]''}}, translated as: ''all life is inter-related and it is the duty of souls to assist each other''- also provides a rational approach of Jains towards Ahimsa.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\nIn conclusion, the insistence of ahimsa is not so much about non-injury to others as it is about non-injury and spiritual welfare of the self. The ultimate rationale of ahimsa is fundamentally about karmic results of the ''hi\u1e43s\u0101'' on self rather than the concern about the well being of other beings for its own sake.<ref>{{harvnb|Jan E.

It is considered one of the most rigorous forms of a spiritually motivated diet on the Indian subcontinent and beyond. The Jain cuisine is completely vegetarian, and it also excludes potatoes, onions and garlic, like the [[shojin-ryori]] cuisine of Japan.\n\nAccording to Am\u1e5btacandra S\u016bri:\n{{quote|\"Those who wish to renounce hi\u1e43s\u0101 must, first of all, make effort to give up the consumption of wine, flesh, honey, and the five ''udumbara'' fruits (the five udumbara trees are Gular, Anjeera, Banyan, Peepal, and Pakar, all belonging to the fig class).|''{{IAST|Puru\u1e63\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya}}'' (61){{sfn|Jain|2012|p=44}}}}\n\nThe strictest forms of Jain diet are practised by the monastic ascetics.

They often oppose the Vedic beliefs in sacrifices and other practices that justified violence in various ways. ''\u0100c\u0101rya Amritacandra's Puru\u1e63\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya'' discuss these wrong beliefs at length to alert the Jain laity to them. These misconceptions are as follows.\n\n===Animal sacrifices===\nThe belief that animals were created for [[yajna]] (sacrifice) and hence it was not considered a slaughter, as it elevated not only the person making the sacrifice, but also the animals was also denounced by the Jains. {{IAST|\u0100c\u0101rya}} Am\u1e5btacandra of {{IAST|Puru\u1e63\u0101rthasiddhyup\u0101ya}} condemned this practice by stating that it is a misconception to hold that Gods are pleased at sacrifices of living beings and there is no wrong in committing hi\u1e43s\u0101 for the sake of religion.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=55}}\n\n{{IAST|\u0100c\u0101rya}} Am\u1e5btacandra says that animals should not be killed for guests or persons deserving respect as often advocated in certain scriptures.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=56}} It is also a wrong belief that wild animals that kill many other animals should be killed.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=57}} This is often justified in the name of hunting of ferocious animals like tigers for sport. Another wrong belief forwarded to justify killing of ferocious animals is that, these kill many lives and accumulate grave sins and hence killing them is an act of mercy. According to Jainism, killing can never be an act of mercy. It is also a misconception to believe that it is advisable to kill those who are suffering so that they may get relief from agony. These sorts of arguments are forwarded to justify killing of those animals that may have become old or injured and hence have become commercially useless.\n\n===Wrong Beliefs===\nOther wrong beliefs are killing those who are in state of happiness or those who are in meditation under wrong belief that the mental state at the time of death will be perpetuated in future lives. It is also a wrong belief that killing of self and others is justified as the soul that is imprisoned in the body will be permanently released and achieve salvation.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=58\u201359}}\n\n==Fruits of nonviolence==\n{{Main|Karma in Jainism}}\nAccording to Jain texts, the fruits of ''hims\u0101'' (violence) depends upon the severity of passions at the time of commencement of such an act.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=38}} One may be responsible for the sinful act of ''hims\u0101'' without actually causing injury; the other, while having caused injury, may not be responsible for the act.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=39}} Also, when two persons commit the act of ''hims\u0101'' jointly, its consequences on fruition (of ''karma'') may be grave for one person and mild for the other.{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=40}}\n\nAccording to Jains, the consequences of karma are inevitable. The consequences may take some time to take effect but the ''karma'' is never fruitless. The latent karma becomes active and bears fruit when the supportive conditions arise. A great part of attracted karma bears its consequences with minor fleeting effects, as generally most of our activities are influenced by mild negative emotions. However, those actions that are influenced by intense negative emotions cause an equally strong karmic attachment which usually does not bear fruit immediately. It takes on an inactive state and waits for the supportive conditions\u2014like proper time, place, and environment\u2014to arise for it to manifest and produce effects. If the supportive conditions do not arise, the respective karmas will manifest at the end of maximum period for which it can remain bound to the soul. These supportive conditions for activation of latent karmas are determined by the nature of karmas, intensity of emotional engagement at the time of binding karmas and our actual relation to time, place, surroundings. There are certain laws of precedence among the karmas, according to which the fruition of some of the karmas may be deferred but not absolutely barred.<ref name=\"real\">{{harvnb|Bhattacharya, Harisatya|1966|p=197}}</ref>\n\n==Appreciation==\n{{IAST|Ahimsa}}, an important tenet of all the religions originating in India, is now considered as an article of faith by the adherents of the [[Indian religions]].\n\nMahatma Gandhi was of the view:{{quote|No religion in the World has explained the principle of Ahimsa so deeply and systematically as is discussed with its applicability in every human life in Jainism.
