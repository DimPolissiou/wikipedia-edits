Search engines provide access to their own data with services such as Google Analytics,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://marketingplatform.google.com/about/analytics/|title=Analytics Tools & Solutions for Your Business - Google Analytics|website=marketingplatform.google.com|language=en|access-date=2018-09-03}}</ref> Google Trends and Google Insights. Third party services must collect their data from [[ISP]]'s, [[phoning home]] software, or from [[web scraping|scraping]] search engines. Getting traffic statistics from ISP's and phone homes provides for broader reporting of [[web traffic]] in addition to search analytics. Services that perform keyword monitoring only scrape a limited set of search results depending on their clients' needs. Services providing reverse search however, must scrape a large set of keywords from the search engines, usually in the millions, to find the keywords that everyone is using.\n\nSince search results, especially advertisements, differ depending on where you are searching from, data collection methods have to account for geographic location. Keyword monitors do this more easily since they typically know what location their client is targeting. However, to get an exhaustive reverse search, several locations need to be scraped for the same keyword.\n\n==Accuracy==\nSearch analytics accuracy depends on service being used, data collection method, and data freshness. Google releases its own data, but only in an aggregated way and often without assigning absolute values such as number of visitors to its graphs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/trends/about.html |title=About Google Trends&nbsp;\u2013 Google Trends |date= |accessdate=2012-07-09}}</ref> [[internet service provider|ISP]] logs and phone home methods are accurate for the population they sample, so sample size and [[demographics]] must be adequate to accurately represent the larger population.

Paid results, from [[Google Adwords]] for example, are often different for the same search depending on the time, geographic location, and history of searches from a particular computer.

Baba runs off and brings out his most powerful robot, but it is easily destroyed by Mikoto, who threatens Baba to never approach her friends ever again. \n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist\n| 1 = A Certain Scientific Railgun T\n| EpisodeNumber       = 7\n| EpisodeNumber2      = 55\n| Title               = Auribus oculi fideliores sunt.

The medal may be presented to any member of the [[Government of the United States|federal government]], including both military [[astronaut]]s and civilian employees.\n\nThe NASA Distinguished Service Medal is awarded to those who display distinguished service, ability, or courage, and have personally made a contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission.  The contribution must be so extraordinary that other forms of recognition would be inadequate.\n\nTypical presentations of the NASA Distinguished Service Medal included awards to senior NASA administrators, mission control leaders, and astronauts who have completed several successful space flights.  Due to the prestige of the award, the decoration is authorized for wear on active uniforms of the [[United States military]].  Another such authorized decoration is the [[NASA Space Flight Medal]].\n\nUpon the recommendation of NASA, the president may award an even higher honor to astronauts, the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]].\n\nThe medal was original awarded by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] and was inherited by NASA. The first NASA version (type I), featuring the [[NASA seal]], was issued from 1959 until 1964, when it was replaced by the current type II medal (shown).\n\n[[File:Webb-nasa-distinguished-ser.png|thumb|upright=1.4|James Webb's award, 1 November 1968]]\n\n==Recipients==\n\n===1959===\n* [[John W.

The medal may be presented to any member of the [[Government of the United States|federal government]], including both military [[astronaut]]s and civilian employees.\n\nThe NASA Distinguished Service Medal is awarded to those who display distinguished service, ability, or courage, and have personally made a contribution representing substantial progress to the NASA mission.  The contribution must be so extraordinary that other forms of recognition would be inadequate.\n\nTypical presentations of the NASA Distinguished Service Medal included awards to senior NASA administrators, mission control leaders, and astronauts who have completed several successful space flights.  Due to the prestige of the award, the decoration is authorized for wear on active uniforms of the [[United States military]].  Another such authorized decoration is the [[NASA Space Flight Medal]].\n\nUpon the recommendation of NASA, the president may award an even higher honor to astronauts, the [[Congressional Space Medal of Honor]].\n\nThe medal was original awarded by the [[National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics]] and was inherited by NASA. The first NASA version (type I), featuring the [[NASA seal]], was issued from 1959 until 1964, when it was replaced by the current type II medal (shown).\n\n[[File:Webb-nasa-distinguished-ser.png|thumb|right|James Webb's award, 1 November 1968]]\n\n==Recipients==\n\n===1959===\n* [[John W.

The first game scheduled in the East was against the Newton Athletic Club of Boston on October 26th. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49393421/will-start-on-its-eastern-trip/|title=WILL START ON ITS EASTERN TRIP.|date=1895-10-24|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-23|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n'''October 25:''' The schedule for Chicago AA's trip was highlighted by the ''[[Chicago Inter Ocean]]''.\n\n* ''October 25:'' CAA arrives in Boston, and will be staying at the [[Copley Square Hotel]]\n* ''October 26:'' A game against Newton AC in Boston, MA\n* ''October 29:'' A game against [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] in Cambridge, MA, \n* ''November 1:'' A game against [[1895 Penn Quakers football team|Penn]] in Philadelphia, PA\n* ''November 2:'' The team goes to watch the Harvard\u2013Princeton football game\n* ''November 5:'' A game against Orange AC in East Orange, NJ\n* ''November 7:'' CAA leaves for Wilmington, Delaware, to play the local YMCA team, then travels to Pittsburgh, and will stay at Hotel Schlosser\n* ''November 9:'' A game against Duquesne Athletic and Country Club in Pittsburgh, PA\n* ''November 10:'' The team arrives back in Chicago\n\nPenn and Orange AC were outlined as the most difficult games of the trip, with the Penn Quakers in particular on a ten game win streak, along with having outscored their opponents '''298 to 0'''.

Under the watchful eyes of 2800 spectators, CAA had the ball on Newton's 5 yard line, with 35 seconds to go.  First, second, and third down went by with no gain for the Chicago AA Eleven.  With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player, Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.  Brown also had a good game, and Bartl got injured.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49425460/chicago-athletes-win-their-game-at/|title=Chicago Athletes Win Their Game at Newton, Mass, 4 To 0.|date=1895-10-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n===October 29: CAA at MIT===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs MIT\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= MIT Engineers\n|V1=24|V2=22\n|H1=0|H2=0\n|Date= October 29, 1895\n|Location= Cambridge, MA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3:30pm\n|ElapsedTime= 40 minutes (two 20 minute halves)\n|Attendance= 500\n|Weather=\n|Referee= F.

The two teams were in poor condition, but MIT was worse, having six substitutes starting, instead of their more experienced players.  The football teams had also played a tie game in 1894, where both organizations were in their prime.  Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.  With 4 minutes left to play the game was called, as MIT had absolutely no chance of recovering the deficit, and were thoroughly defeated. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49479526/chicago-wins-at-boston-athletic/|title=Chicago Wins at Boston.

It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.  Penn was 10-0, having shut out 9 and outscored their opponents 349 to 6.  Chicago lost that contest 10 to 12, but was the first opponent of the season to scored double digits against the Quakers.\n\n===November 1st: CAA at Penn===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs Penn\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= Penn Quakers\n|V1=0|V2=4\n|H1=4|H2=8\n|Date= November 1, 1895\n|Location= Franklin Field, Philadelphia, PA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3pm\n|ElapsedTime= \n|Attendance=\n|Weather=\n|Referee= \n|Umpire= \n|Injured= \n|Linesmen= \n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nCAA played rough, dirty in the eyes of some, as they lost to the superior university team of Pennsylvania, 4 to 12. CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H.

Hadden had the best performance of the day for Chicago as Right Tackle, while Slater also played well against the Jersey men.  \n\n\n\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

Under the watchful eyes of 2800 spectators, CAA had the ball on Newton's 5 yard line, with 35 seconds to go.  First, second, and third down went by with no gain for the Chicago AA Eleven.  With 10 seconds remaining, it was still Chicago's possession, and with one last shove at the Newton Defensive Line, Full Back Brown rolled into the endzone over a mass of players, achieving a walk-off touchdown and subsequent PAT.  The game could've been won in the first half, had Chicago AA not fumbled on the Newton AC 4 yard line, but besides that the game was close and both sides held up well.  Stevenson was the center of attention for the Athletics, holding the line firm and knocking back Newton's star player, Mr. Draper, numerous times throughout the contest.  Brown also had a good game, and Bartl got injured.  <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49425460/chicago-athletes-win-their-game-at/|title=Chicago Athletes Win Their Game at Newton, Mass, 4 To 0.|date=1895-10-27|work=Chicago Tribune|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=6}}</ref>\n\n===October 29: CAA at MIT===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs MIT\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= MIT Engineers\n|V1=24|V2=22\n|H1=0|H2=0\n|Date= October 29, 1895\n|Location= Cambridge, MA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3:30pm\n|ElapsedTime= 40 minutes (two 20 minute halves)\n|Attendance= 500\n|Weather=\n|Referee= F.

The two teams were in poor condition, but MIT was worse, having six substitutes starting, instead of their more experienced players.  The football teams had also played a tie game in 1894, where both organizations were in their prime.  Slater was yet again a star player, pulling off 3 touchdowns, while Hadden played well in his new Right Tackle position, and scored 3 touchdowns himself.  Brown also had a great day, going 7 for 8 in PATs, with 2 touchdowns of his own.  Other players that put points on the board for CAA was Thomas with two and Huddelston with one.  With 4 minutes left to play the game was called, as MIT had absolutely no chance of recovering the deficit, and were thoroughly defeated. <ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49479526/chicago-wins-at-boston-athletic/|title=Chicago Wins at Boston.

It would be played at Penn's own [[Franklin Field]], on the corner of 33rd and spruce streets.  The last time the Chicago Athletic Association played the Pennsylvania Quakers, it was 1892, and the situation at hand was remarkably similar to that of the 1895 contest.  Penn was 10-0, having shut out 9 and outscored their opponents 349 to 6.  Chicago lost that contest 10 to 12, but was the first opponent of the season to scored double digits against the Quakers.\n\n===November 1st: CAA at Penn===\n{{AFB game box start\n|Title= CAA vs Penn\n|Visitor= Chicago AA\n|Host= Penn Quakers\n|V1=0|V2=4\n|H1=4|H2=8\n|Date= November 1, 1895\n|Location= Franklin Field, Philadelphia, PA\n|TimeZone= EST\n|StartTime= 3pm\n|ElapsedTime= \n|Attendance=\n|Weather=\n|Referee= \n|Umpire= \n|Injured= \n|Linesmen= \n}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\nCAA played rough, dirty in the eyes of some, as they lost to the superior university team of Pennsylvania, 4 to 12. CAA came into this prime matchup 6-1, while outscoring their opponents 142 to 8, and recording 6 shutouts.  Penn on the other hand, was 10-0, having shut out '''all ten opponents,''' and outscoring them 370 to 0.  They had won the last 22 contests they had played in, 19 being shutouts, and had not lost a contest since November 30th, 1893, against the [[1893 Harvard Crimson football team|Harvard Crimson]]. The game was actually considered a success for the CAA, as it was the first points scored against the Eastern school in their 1895 season.  Chicago AA was also the first team in the 1895 season to tie Penn at some point in the game (besides a 0-0 tie of course, as every contest starts off with both teams tied at 0), when Slater managed to score on Quakers, 4-4, midway through the 2nd half.  The Penn team was so beaten up by the semi-pros, John C. Bell, head of the University football committee, took out his Penn players in the fear that too many players would get injured.  Seeing as the score was still tied 4 to 4, he eventually let his players back in, where they would score two unanswered touchdowns for the final 4 to 12 score.  Penn was furious after the game, and on November 7th, they officially declared that the school would never play another athletic club, association, or non-collegiate team again, cancelling their 1895 matchup against undefeated Boston AA. The University juggernauts would end the season 14-0, and were declared national champions by the [[Billingsley Report]], [[Helms Athletic Foundation]], [[Houlgate System]], [[National Championship Foundation]], and co-national champions with [[1895 Yale Bulldogs football team|Yale]] by well-known football historian [[Parke H. Davis]] (all retroactively).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49479948/info-on-penn-caa-game/|title=Info on Penn-CAA game|date=1895-10-31|work=The Philadelphia Inquirer|access-date=2020-04-24|pages=11}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/cfb/schools/pennsylvania/1895-schedule.html|title=1895 Pennsylvania Quakers Schedule and Results|website=College Football at Sports-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/49481159/piled-up-points-chicago-a-a-had-easy/|title=PILED UP POINTS Chicago A.

Hadden had the best performance of the day for Chicago as Right Tackle, while Slater also played well against the Jersey men.  \n\n\n\n\n==Roster==\nThere are a few things to note about the 1895 Chicago Athletic Association roster.  One is that positions were not as set in stone as they are in the modern day, and no one on the team had the same position for the whole season (possibly with the exception of star center Archibald Stevenson, who only missed the exhibition against Swift & Co.).  Furthermore, it was a rarity for a team member to play every game in the season, due to the moderate influx of new players every couple weeks and higher risk of injury from the game.  Only Ben Thomas, a Left Tackle/Guard, managed to play every game, and if you don't include the exhibition, that only adds Stevenson.  There were several \"regulars\" though, those who played at least seven or more games in the season.  Those players were Fred Slater, Paul Brown, Ben Thomas, CB Coffeen, DA Stone, Harry G. Hadden, Archibald Stevenson, JR Huddelson, Aldrich, and Olin McCormick.  Notable members of this roster are Harry Hadden, who coached Notre Dame in 1895, Jesse Van Doozer, Northwestern's 1897 coach, and the infamous \"Pudge\" Heffelfinger, who played 4 years at Yale, was a three-time All American, and is credited as the first professional (payed) American football player.\n\n===Past playing experience===\nMost members of the team also had past playing experience at colleges, universities, local, and athletic (semi-pro) teams.

Located on [[Lake Michigan]]'s western shore with significant commercial developments along [[Interstate 43]], the community is a [[suburb]] in the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]]. Despite being an incorporated city, approximately half of Mequon's land in undeveloped and agriculture plays a significant role in the local economy. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 23,132.\n\nWhen the first white settlers arrived in the Mequon area in the 1830s, that area was inhabited by the [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Sauk people]]. In the 1840s, German immigrants settled in the community, building farms and hydropowered mills along the [[Milwaukee River]]. Much of the community remained rural, while [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] developed as a market town along the local railway, providing services to the farmers. Thiensville incorporated as a village in 1910. Mequon remained rural in the early 20th century but experienced significant population growth during the [[suburbanization]] that followed World War II. The community [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of Wisconsin#City|city]] in 1957 to avoid annexation by the City of [[Milwaukee]]. The City of Mequon completely surrounds Thiensville, leading some residents to call Thiensville \"Mequon's donut hole.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Thiensville Business Association |url=https://thiensvillebusiness.com |publisher=Thiensville Business Association |accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref> The two municipalities have a close relationship, with a shared chamber of commerce, library, and school district.\n\n[[Lutheranism]] has played a significant role in Mequon since the community's early years. Some of the first German settlers were [[Old Lutherans]] who founded the Freistadt community \u2013 now a neighborhood in western Mequon \u2013 in 1839 and went on to form the first Lutheran congregation in Wisconsin. In the 21st century, there are more Lutheran churches in Mequon than churches of any other single denomination. Additionally, Mequon is home to two private Lutheran [[higher education|post-secondary]] institutions: [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] and [[Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary]]. In addition to having other Christian denominations, Mequon is the northernmost of Milwaukee's suburbs to have a sizable Jewish community.\n\n==Toponymy==\n\"Mequon\" may have come from the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word \"Emikwaan\" or \"Miguan\", meaning ladle, referring to the shape of the river in the area.<ref>\"[http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm \"Yankee Settler's Cottage.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420074506/http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm |date=2006-04-20}} [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin]] website</ref> Alternatively, the name may come from a [[Menominee language|Menominee]] word ''M\u0113kon'', meaning \"feather.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www4.uwsp.edu/museum/menomineeClans/places/chart.aspx|title=Menominee Place Names in Wisconsin|last=Hoffman|first=Mike|website=The Menominee Clans Story|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Isham Day House Mequon WI May09.jpg|thumb|left|The 1839 [[Isham Day House]] is now a museum located in Settlers Park.]]\n\nThe area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Sauk people]]. In the early 19th century, the   Potawatomi had a village in present-day [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road. In 1831, The Menominee surrendered the land between the [[Milwaukee River]] and [[Lake Michigan]] to the United States Federal Government through the [[Treaty of Washington, with Menominee (1831)|Treaty of Washington]].<ref name= \"corrigan\">Walter D.

The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Freistadt===\n[[File:FSLG.jpg|thumb|right|While Trinity Lutheran Church of Freistadt moved to a stone church in 1884, a reconstruction of the original log structure stands at the Trinity-Freistadt Historic Site.]]\n\nIn October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon. They were [[Old Lutherans]] who had resisted the Prussian government's attempts to take control over the Protestant churches through the [[Prussian Union of Churches]].<ref>Ozaukee County.

It was the first Lutheran church in Wisconsin. In 1845, what would become the [[Lutheran Synod of Buffalo]] was organized in Freistadt.

A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.\n\nThien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers. The influence of the freethinker societies kept formal churches out of the village until 1919, when St. Cecilia Catholic Church was built.<ref>{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: Village of Thiensville|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/village-of-thiensville/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThiensville grew in part because of its location on the [[Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad|Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway]], which was constructed in the early 1870s. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.\n\nIn 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A.

Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier.

Located on [[Lake Michigan]]'s western shore with significant commercial developments along [[Interstate 43]], the community is a [[suburb]] in the [[Milwaukee metropolitan area]]. Despite being an incorporated city, approximately half of Mequon's land in undeveloped and agriculture plays a significant role in the local economy. At the time of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] the population was 23,132.\n\nWhen the first white settlers arrived in the Mequon area in the 1830s, that area was inhabited by the [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Sauk people]]. In the 1840s, German immigrants settled in the community, building farms and hydropowered mills along the [[Milwaukee River]]. Much of the community remained rural, while [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] developed as a market town along the local railway, providing services to the farmers. Thiensville incorporated as a village in 1910. Mequon remained rural in the early 20th century but experienced significant population growth during the [[suburbanization]] that followed World War II. The community [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] as a [[Administrative divisions of Wisconsin#City|city]] in 1957 to avoid annexation by the City of [[Milwaukee]]. The City of Mequon completely surrounds Thiensville, leading some residents to call Thiensville \"Mequon's donut hole.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Thiensville Business Association |url=https://thiensvillebusiness.com |publisher=Thiensville Business Association |accessdate=April 24, 2020}}</ref> The two municipalities have a close relationship, with a shared chamber of commerce, library, and school district.\n\n[[Lutheranism]] has played a significant role in Mequon since the community's early years. Some of the first German settlers were [[Old Lutherans]] who founded the Freistadt community \u2013 now a neighborhood in western Mequon \u2013 in 1839 and went on to form the first Lutheran congregation in Wisconsin. In the 21st century, there are more Lutheran churches in Mequon than churches of any other single denomination. Additionally, Mequon is home to two private Lutheran [[higher education|post-secondary]] institutions: [[Concordia University Wisconsin]] and [[Wisconsin Lutheran Seminary]]. In addition to having other Christian denominations, Mequon is the northernmost of Milwaukee's suburbs to have a sizable Jewish community.\n\n==Toponymy==\n\"Mequon\" may have come from the [[Ojibwe language|Ojibwe]] word \"Emikwaan\" or \"Miguan\", meaning ladle, referring to the shape of the river in the area.<ref>\"[http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm \"Yankee Settler's Cottage.\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060420074506/http://www.co.ozaukee.wi.us/history/YankeeSettler.htm |date=2006-04-20}} [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin]] website</ref> Alternatively, the name may come from a [[Menominee language|Menominee]] word ''M\u0113kon'', meaning \"feather.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www4.uwsp.edu/museum/menomineeClans/places/chart.aspx|title=Menominee Place Names in Wisconsin|last=Hoffman|first=Mike|website=The Menominee Clans Story|access-date=2018-10-05}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Isham Day House Mequon WI May09.jpg|thumb|left|The 1839 [[Isham Day House]] is now a museum located in Settlers Park.]]\n\nThe area was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the [[Menominee]], [[Potawatomi]], and [[Sauk people]]. In the early 19th century, the   Potawatomi had a village in present-day [[Thiensville, Wisconsin|Thiensville]] located on Pigeon Creek, north of Freistadt Road.

The first permanent white settlers arrived in the mid-1830s from New York, England, and Ireland. One of the first settlers was John Weston, who settled near present-day Thiensville in 1837 and served as the first postmaster of the Town of Mequon. One of the oldest surviving buildings from this period is the [[Isham Day House]], constructed in 1839 on the west bank of the river. The first [[Germans]] arrived in 1839, and in the 1840s Germans became the largest ethnic group in Mequon and Ozaukee County.<ref>{{cite web|title=Early history of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|url=http://digicoll.library.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/WI/WI-idx?type=div&did=WI.OzEarlyHist.i0034&isize=M|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Madison Libraries|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\n===Freistadt===\n[[File:FSLG.jpg|thumb|right|While Trinity Lutheran Church of Freistadt moved to a stone church in 1884, a reconstruction of the original log structure stands at the Trinity-Freistadt Historic Site.]]\n\nIn October 1839, a party of twenty German families from [[Province of Pomerania (1815\u20131945)|Pomerania]], [[Prussia]], settled the Freistadt community in the western part of the Town of Mequon.

A year later he employed a group of Native American laborers to construct a dam and a canal. He then built a sawmill and a store. Thien hosted the first town meeting for the Town of Mequon in 1846,<ref name= \"corrigan\"/> and in 1857 he established the volunteer fire department and served as its first captain.\n\nThien was a [[Freethought|freethinker]], as were many of the early German settlers.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Thiensville was one of the most concentrated communities in the Town of Mequon. While most of Mequon was quite rural, Theinsville functioned as a downtown area with stores, mills, and professional services. The village of Theinsville incorporated in 1910.\n\nIn 1945, eighty German [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] from Camp Fredonia in [[Little Kohler, Wisconsin]] were contracted to work at the Herbert A.

Between 1950 and 1960, the population increased by roughly 110%, from 4,065 to 8,543. With growth came the risk that municipalities such as Thiensville or [[Milwaukee]] would try to annex land from the Town of Mequon, as happened to the Milwaukee County's [[Lake, Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Town of Lake]] in 1954 and [[Granville, Milwaukee|Town of Granville]] in 1956. With a 1957 population of about 7,500, Mequon incorporated as a city under the terms of Wisconsin statute 66.0215, also known as \"The Oak Creek Law,\" which had been crafted to prevent suburban towns from being annexed by other municipalities.<ref>[http://nxt.legis.state.wi.us/nxt/gateway.dll?f=templates&fn=default.htm&vid=WI:Default&d=stats&jd=66.0215 Wisconsin Legislature Data<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref name=\"Encyclopedia\">{{cite web|title=Encyclopedia of Milwaukee: City of Mequon|url=https://emke.uwm.edu/entry/city-of-mequon/|publisher=University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee|accessdate=2020-01-03}}</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow with the construction of [[Interstate 43]] in the mid-1960s, making travel to Milwaukee easier.

It is the seventeenth season in the ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' franchise, featuring the fifteenth generation of Cures. It is directed by Yoko Ikeda and written by Junko Komura. The series began airing on all [[All-Nippon News Network|ANN]] stations in Japan on February 2, 2020, succeeding ''[[Star Twinkle PreCure]]'' in its initial time slot. It is the second series in the franchise to have nature as its main topic after ''[[Pretty Cure Splash Star]]'', with elements and medicine used for the Cure's main motifs.\n\n==Story==\n13-year old Nodoka Hanadera just recently moved to the town of Sukoyaka with her family in hopes that it can give her a fresh start from her life in the city. Meanwhile, in a place deep inside the Earth known as the \"Healing Garden\", everything is in ruins after an attack from an antagonistic group called the Byougens, whose goal is to infect the garden and slowly poison the planet. Its ruler, Teatine, entrusted the care of her daughter Latte to the \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran, on a mission to go to the surface world and find three people whose hearts can resonate with their paws and can partner with them. While on Earth, the fairies witness an attack from the Byougens. In a sudden twist of fate, Rabirin meets up with Nodoka who, despite her somewhat frail condition, is determined to protect others. This determination resonated with Rabirin and resulted in Nodoka becoming the Pretty Cure foretold in legend, Cure Grace. Joined in by Chiyu/Cure Fontaine and Hinata/Cure Sparkle, they all form the Healin' Good Pretty Cure team in order to fight against the threat of the Byougens and protect all life on Earth and the Healing Garden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Pretty Cures===\n;{{nihongo|Nodoka Hanadera|\u82b1\u5bfa\u306e\u3069\u304b|Hanadera Nodoka}} / {{nihongo|Cure Grace|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Kyua Gur\u0113su}}<ref name=HPR>{{cite news|date=26 December 2019|url=https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0113206|work=Cinematoday|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2019|title=\u300c\u30d2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3063\u3069\u3000\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u300d\u58f0\u512a\u306b\u60a0\u6728\u78a7\uff01\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u767a\u8868}}</ref>\n:{{anime voice|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]}}<ref name=HPR/>\n:A girl who is the pink-colored Pretty Cure of Flowers, her fairy partner is Rabirin<ref name=HPR/> and has moved to Sukoyaka City.

It is the seventeenth season in the ''[[Pretty Cure]]'' franchise, featuring the fifteenth generation of Cures. It is directed by Yoko Ikeda and written by Junko Komura. The series began airing on all [[All-Nippon News Network|ANN]] stations in Japan on February 2, 2020, succeeding ''[[Star Twinkle PreCure]]'' in its initial time slot. It is the second series in the franchise to have nature as its main topic after ''[[Pretty Cure Splash Star]]'', with elements and medicine used for the Cure's main motifs.\n\n==Story==\n13-year old Nodoka Hanadera just recently moved to the town of Sukoyaka with her family in hopes that it can give her a fresh start from her life in the city. Meanwhile, in a place deep inside the Earth known as the \"Healing Garden\", everything is in ruins after an attack from an antagonistic group called the Byougens, whose goal is to infect the garden and slowly poison the planet. Its ruler, Teatine, entrusted the care of her daughter Latte to the \"medical trainee\" Healing Animals: Rabirin, Pegitan and Nyatoran, on a mission to go to the surface world and find three people whose hearts can resonate with their paws and can partner with them. While on Earth, the fairies witness an attack from the Byougens. In a sudden twist of fate, Rabirin meets up with Nodoka who, despite her somewhat frail condition, is determined to protect others. This determination resonated with Rabirin and resulted in Nodoka becoming the Pretty Cure foretold in legend, Cure Grace. Joined in by Chiyu/Cure Fontaine and Hinata/Cure Sparkle, they all form the Healin' Good Pretty Cure team in order to fight against the threat of the Byougens and protect all life on Earth and the Healing Garden.\n\n==Characters==\n===Pretty Cures===\n;{{nihongo|Nodoka Hanadera|\u82b1\u5bfa\u306e\u3069\u304b|Hanadera Nodoka}} / {{nihongo|Cure Grace|\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u30b0\u30ec\u30fc\u30b9|Kyua Gur\u0113su}}<ref name=HPR>{{cite news|date=26 December 2019|url=https://www.cinematoday.jp/news/N0113206|work=Cinematoday|language=Japanese|accessdate=25 December 2019|title=\u300c\u30d2\u30fc\u30ea\u30f3\u30b0\u3063\u3069\u3000\u30d7\u30ea\u30ad\u30e5\u30a2\u300d\u58f0\u512a\u306b\u60a0\u6728\u78a7\uff01\u30e1\u30a4\u30f3\u30ad\u30e3\u30b9\u30c8\u767a\u8868}}</ref>\n:{{anime voice|[[Aoi Y\u016bki]]}}<ref name=HPR/>\n:A girl who is the pink-colored Pretty Cure of Flowers, her fairy partner is Rabirin<ref name=HPR/> and has moved to Sukoyaka City.
