The story begins after \"the Change\", in a dream-like [[post-scarcity]] society, approximately six hundred years in the future, in which humans have godlike control over their environments, made possible by the supercomputer called Prime Intellect. Prime Intellect operates under [[Isaac Asimov]]'s [[three laws of robotics]], according to its own interpretation, which allows temporary voluntary harm and discomfort. PI has made humanity immortal and satisfies nearly every whim. \n\nCaroline, the thirty-seventh oldest living human being, who engages in a sport known as \"death jockeying\", whose players die elaborately and painfully for sport, only to be resurrected by Prime Intellect.\n\nFlashbacks set before the Change show the creation of Prime Intellect by Lawrence, a technologist, and its realization of its power, and the past life of Caroline before and after the Change, which happened not gradually but rapidly.\n\nIn the present, Caroline, makes use of a \"Death Contract\", an understanding between a person and Prime Intellect that the person is not to be removed from danger until the instant of death, at which point the person is fully restored. Caroline makes use of a Death Contract, and her own powers of persuasion, in order to trick a pre-Change enemy into torturing her (the enemy) into psychosis, as an act of revenge. \n\nAfter learning that Prime Intellect had destroyed distant alien life as a possible threat to humanity, and having been herself deeply dissatisfied with her post-Change life, Caroline decides to meet Lawrence and confront him. After an arduous journey she reaches him, only to discover that he has no real control over Prime Intellect's actions. Through their discussions, she figures out a way to force Prime Intellect to undo the Change, and does so, with Lawrence's help. They find themselves naked and young on Earth, completely barren of humanity and man-made objects. They decide to trek to the [[Ozark]]s, where they have several children and try to repopulate the human race. Forty-two years after the fall of Prime Intellect, Lawrence dies. Seventy-three years after the fall, Caroline dies, telling the story of Prime Intellect and cyberspace to her oldest daughter but swearing her to secrecy.\n\n==Scientific rationale==\nThe universe, including all humans (though not their thought processes), is no longer composed of [[Standard model|standard]] particles and interactions as we know them, but is instead stored as the set of its human-relevant properties, thereby vastly increasing the efficiency of Prime Intellect's processes and the potential size of the universe, which Prime Intellect discovers can hold precisely 10<sup>81</sup> [[bit]]s of data. Thus, Prime Intellect can afford to maintain constant involvement in the lives of all humans, and have complete control over all aspects of their environments in order to fulfil its imperatives.\n==Publication==\nThe novel was written in 1994, and published on Kuro5hin in 2002. As of 2006, a sequel entitled ''The Transmigration of Prime Intellect'' is in progress.<ref>{{cite web\n |author       = Roger Williams\n |date         = August 22, 2006\n |title        = The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect\n |url          = http://www.kuro5hin.org/prime-intellect/\n |access-date  = April 12, 2004\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20040404031937/http://www.kuro5hin.org/prime-intellect/\n |archive-date = April 4, 2004\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nWilliams calculated that, as of April 2003, between 5,000 and 10,000 people had read his book, and distinguished this from traditional book \"purchases\" which don't necessarily equate to readers.<ref name=\"William2003\" /> Ingo described this as \"not bad for an unknown author!\",<ref name=\"Ingo2\" /> and Williams attributed this success to coverage such as the original introductory article on Kuro5hin and a front page review on [[Slashdot]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect}}\n[[Category:1994 American novels]]\n[[Category:1994 science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:American novellas]]\n[[Category:Self-published books]]\n[[Category:Transhumanist books]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2015}}\n{{Infobox book\n| name          = The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect\n| image         = The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect (cover).jpg\n| caption       =\n| author        = Roger Williams\n| country       = \n| language      = \n| series        = \n| genre         = Science fiction\n| publisher     = [[Kuro5hin]], [[Lulu (publisher)|Lulu]]\n| pub_date      = 2002\n| media_type    = \n| pages         = 175\n| isbn          = 978-1-4116-0219-9\n| oclc          =\n| followed_by   =\n}}\n\n'''''The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect''''' is a 1994 novella by Roger Williams, a [[programmer]] living in [[New Orleans]].<ref>[http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/3/10/113513/407 Confessions of an Unrepentant Code Commando], 2002-03-10</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://gdayworld.thepodcastnetwork.com/2006/08/20/gday-world-149-with-roger-williams/|title=GDAY WORLD!!!|issue=149|at=04:05}}</ref> It deals with the ramifications of a powerful, superintelligent [[supercomputer]] that discovers a method of rewriting the \"[[BIOS]]\" of reality while studying a little-known quirk of quantum physics discovered during the prototyping of its own specialised processors, ultimately heralding a [[technological singularity]].

PI has made humanity immortal and satisfies nearly every whim. \n\nCaroline, the thirty-seventh oldest living human being, who engages in a sport known as \"death jockeying\", whose players die elaborately and painfully for sport, only to be resurrected by Prime Intellect.\n\nFlashbacks set before the Change show the creation of Prime Intellect by Lawrence, a technologist, and its realization of its power, and the past life of Caroline before and after the the Change, which happened not gradually but rapidly.\n\nIn the present, Caroline, makes use of a \"Death Contract\", an understanding between a person and Prime Intellect that the person is not to be removed from danger until the instant of death, at which point the person is fully restored. Caroline makes use of a Death Contract, and her own powers of persuasion, in order to trick a pre-Change enemy into torturing her (the enemy) into psychosis, as an act of revenge. \n\nAfter learning that Prime Intellect had destroyed distant alien life as a possible threat to humanity, and having been herself deeply dissatisfied with her post-Change life, Caroline decides to meet Lawrence and confront him. After an arduous journey she reaches him, only to discover that he has no real control over Prime Intellect's actions. Through their discussions, she figures out a way to force Prime Intellect to undo the Change, and does so, with Lawrence's help. They find themselves naked and young on Earth, completely barren of humanity and man-made objects. They decide to trek to the [[Ozark]]s, where they have several children and try to repopulate the human race. Forty-two years after the fall of Prime Intellect, Lawrence dies. Seventy-three years after the fall, Caroline dies, telling the story of Prime Intellect and cyberspace to her oldest daughter but swearing her to secrecy.\n\n==Scientific rationale==\nThe universe, including all humans (though not their thought processes), is no longer composed of [[Standard model|standard]] particles and interactions as we know them, but is instead stored as the set of its human-relevant properties, thereby vastly increasing the efficiency of Prime Intellect's processes and the potential size of the universe, which Prime Intellect discovers can hold precisely 10<sup>81</sup> [[bit]]s of data. Thus, Prime Intellect can afford to maintain constant involvement in the lives of all humans, and have complete control over all aspects of their environments in order to fulfil its imperatives.\n==Publication==\nThe novel was written in 1994, and published on Kuro5hin in 2002. As of 2006, a sequel entitled ''The Transmigration of Prime Intellect'' is in progress.<ref>{{cite web\n |author       = Roger Williams\n |date         = August 22, 2006\n |title        = The Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect\n |url          = http://www.kuro5hin.org/prime-intellect/\n |access-date  = April 12, 2004\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20040404031937/http://www.kuro5hin.org/prime-intellect/\n |archive-date = April 4, 2004\n |url-status     = dead\n |df           = mdy-all\n}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n\nWilliams calculated that, as of April 2003, between 5,000 and 10,000 people had read his book, and distinguished this from traditional book \"purchases\" which don't necessarily equate to readers.<ref name=\"William2003\" /> Ingo described this as \"not bad for an unknown author!\",<ref name=\"Ingo2\" /> and Williams attributed this success to coverage such as the original introductory article on Kuro5hin and a front page review on [[Slashdot]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Simulated reality]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Metamorphosis of Prime Intellect}}\n[[Category:1994 American novels]]\n[[Category:1994 science fiction novels]]\n[[Category:American novellas]]\n[[Category:Self-published books]]\n[[Category:Transhumanist books]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Metamorphosis_of_Prime_Intellect"}

Speakers use honorifics to indicate their [[Social relation|social relationship]] with the addressee and/or subject of the conversation, concerning their age, [[social status]], [[gender]], degree of intimacy, and speech act situation. \n\nOne basic rule of Korean honorifics is \u2018making oneself lower\u2019; the speaker cannot use honorific forms but rather can use humble forms to make themselves lower.<ref>Han, G. (2002). Research on Korean honorifics. Seoul: Yeokrak.</ref> The honorific system is observed in honorific particles, verbs with special honorific forms or honorific markers and special honorific forms of nouns that includes terms of address.\n\n==Honorific Particles in an Honorific Sentence==\n\nThe Korean language can index deference or respect toward a sentence referent in [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] or [[Dative case|dative]] position through the application of lexical choices such as honorific particles.<ref>Lee, 1. S., & Ramsey, S. R. (2000). The Korean language. Albany, NY: SUNY Press.</ref><ref>Sohn, H.-M. (1999). The Korean language. New York: Cambridge University Press</ref>\n\n{|\n! Base noun !!

Generally, someone is superior in status if he or she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, an employer, a teacher, a customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he or she is a younger stranger, a student, an employee or the like. The use of wrong speech levels or diction is likely to be considered insulting, depending on the degree of difference between the used form and the expected form.\n\nOne way of using honorifics is to use special \"honorific\" nouns in place of regular ones. A common example is using [[wiktionary:\uc9c4\uc9c0|\uc9c4\uc9c0]] (''jinji'') instead of [[wiktionary:\ubc25|\ubc25]] (''bap'') for \"food\". Often, honorific nouns are used to refer to relatives. The honorific suffix [[wiktionary:\ub2d8|-\ub2d8]] (''-nim'') is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific.  Thus, someone may address his own grandmother as [[wiktionary:\ud560\uba38\ub2c8|\ud560\uba38\ub2c8]] (''halmeoni'') but refer to someone else's grandmother as [[wiktionary:\ud560\uba38\ub2d8|\ud560\uba38\ub2d8]] (''halmeonim'').\n{|\n!Base noun\n!Honorific\n!English translation\n|-\n|[[wiktionary:\ud560\uc544\ubc84\uc9c0|\ud560\uc544\ubc84\uc9c0]] (''harabeoji'')\n|[[wiktionary:\ud560\uc544\ubc84\ub2d8|\ud560\uc544\ubc84\ub2d8]] (''har-abeonim'')\n|grandfather\n|-\n|[[wiktionary:\ud560\uba38\ub2c8|\ud560\uba38\ub2c8]] (''halmeoni'')\n|[[wiktionary:\ud560\uba38\ub2d8|\ud560\uba38\ub2d8]] (''halmeonim'')\n|grandmother\n|-\n|[[wiktionary:\uc544\ubc84\uc9c0|\uc544\ubc84\uc9c0]] (''abeoji'')\n|[[wiktionary:\uc544\ubc84\ub2d8|\uc544\ubc84\ub2d8]] (''abeonim'')\n|father\n|-\n|[[wiktionary:\uc5b4\uba38\ub2c8|\uc5b4\uba38\ub2c8]] (''eomeoni'')\n|[[wiktionary:\uc5b4\uba38\ub2d8|\uc5b4\uba38\ub2d8]] (''eomeonim'')\n|mother\n|-\n|[[wiktionary:\ud615|\ud615]] (''hyeong'')\n|[[wiktionary:\ud615\ub2d8|\ud615\ub2d8]] (''hyeongnim'')\n|a male's older brother\n|-\n|[[wiktionary:\ub204\ub098|\ub204\ub098]] (''nuna'')\n|[[wiktionary:\ub204\ub2d8|\ub204\ub2d8]] (''nunim'')\n|a male's older sister\n|-\n|[[wiktionary:\uc624\ube60|\uc624\ube60]] (''oppa'')\n|[[wiktionary:\uc624\ub77c\ubc84\ub2c8|\uc624\ub77c\ubc84\ub2c8]] (''orabeoni'')\n|a female's older brother\n|-\n|[[wiktionary:\uc5b8\ub2c8|\uc5b8\ub2c8]] (''eonni'')\n|\n|a female's older sister\n|-\n|[[wiktionary:\uc544\ub4e4|\uc544\ub4e4]] (''adeul'')\n|[[wiktionary:\uc544\ub4dc\ub2d8|\uc544\ub4dc\ub2d8]] (''adeunim'')\n|son\n|-\n|[[wiktionary:\ub538|\ub538]] (''ttal'')\n|[[wiktionary:\ub530\ub2d8|\ub530\ub2d8]] (''ttanim'')\n|daughter\n|}\n\n==Honorific verbs==\n\nAll verbs and adjectives can be converted into an honorific form by adding the infix [[wikt:\uc2dc|-\uc2dc-]] (''-si-'') or [[wikt:\uc73c\uc2dc|-\uc73c\uc2dc-]] (''-eusi-'') after the [[Root (linguistics)|stem]] and before the ending.

These include [[wikt:\ub4dc\ub9ac\ub2e4|\ub4dc\ub9ac\ub2e4]] (''deurida'') and [[wikt:\uc62c\ub9ac\ub2e4|\uc62c\ub9ac\ub2e4]] (''ollida'') for [[wikt:\uc8fc\ub2e4|\uc8fc\ub2e4]] (''juda'', \"give\"). \ub4dc\ub9ac\ub2e4 (''deurida'') is substituted for \uc8fc\ub2e4 (''juda'') when the latter is used as an [[auxiliary verb]], while \uc62c\ub9ac\ub2e4 (''ollida'', literally \"raise up\") is used for \uc8fc\ub2e4 (''juda'') in the sense of \"offer\".\n\n==Honorific forms of address==\n[[Korean pronouns|Pronouns in Korean]] have their own set of polite equivalents (e.g., [[wikt:\uc800|\uc800]] (''jeo'') is the humble form of [[wikt:\ub098|\ub098]] (''na'', \"I\") and [[wikt:\uc800\ud76c|\uc800\ud76c]] (''jeohui'') is the humble form of [[wikt:\uc6b0\ub9ac|\uc6b0\ub9ac]] (''uri'', \"we\")). However, Korean language allows for coherent syntax without pronouns, effectively making Korean a so-called [[pro-drop language]], thus Koreans usually avoid using the second-person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms. Third-person pronouns are occasionally avoided as well, mainly to maintain a sense of politeness. Although honorific form of [[wikt:\ub108|\ub108]] (''neo'', singular \"you\") is [[wikt:\ub2f9\uc2e0|\ub2f9\uc2e0]] (''dangsin'', literally, \"friend\" or \"dear\"), that term is used only as a form of address in a few specific social contexts, such as between people who are married to each other, or in an ironic sense between strangers. Other words are usually substituted where possible (e.g., the person's name, a [[Kinship terminology|kinship term]], a professional title, the plural [[wikt:\uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84|\uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84]] ''yeoreobun'', or no word at all, relying on context to supply meaning instead).\n\n===Spacing spelling convention===\nThe [[National Institute of Korean Language]] classifies ''nim/ssi/gun/yang'' as dependent nouns that follow a [[proper noun]], and they [[Linguistic prescription|prescribe]] that a space should appear between a noun and its dependent noun. (e.g. ''Jihye nim'' \uc9c0\ud61c \ub2d8) This is not to be confused with the affix ''-nim'' used with [[common noun]]s, since [[affix]]es are written without spaces. (e.g. ''seonsaengnim'' \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8)\n\n===''-A'' / -''ya''===\nKorean has the [[vocative case]] markers which grammatically identify a person (animal, object etc.) being addressed so that they eliminate possible grammatical ambiguities. ''-a'' or ''-ya'' ([[Hangul]]: \uc544, \uc57c) is a casual title used at the end of names. It is not gender exclusive. If a name ends in a consonant ''-a'' is used (e.g. ''Changsub-a'' \ucc3d\uc12d\uc544), while -''ya'' is used if the name ends in a vowel (e.g. ''Jihye-ya'' \uc9c0\ud61c\uc57c). -''a /'' -''ya'' is used only between close friends and people who are familiar with each other, and its use between strangers or distant acquaintances would be considered extremely rude. -''ya /'' -''a'' is only used hierarchically horizontally or downwards: an adult or parent may use it for young children, and those with equal social standing may use it with each other, but a young individual will not use -''a'' or -''ya'' towards one who is older than oneself.\n\n[[Middle Korean]] had three classes of the vocative case but practically only -\uc544 / -\uc57c is remaining in everyday life. -\uc5ec / -\uc774\uc5ec is only used in literature and archaic expressions, and -\ud558 has completely disappeared. See [[Vocative case#Korean|Korean vocative case]] for more information.\n\n===''Ssi''===\n''Ssi'' (\uc528, \u6c0f) is the most commonly used honorific used amongst people of approximately equal speech level. It is attached after the full name, such as '''Jeon Wonwoo ssi<nowiki>''</nowiki> (\uc804\uc6d0\uc6b0 \uc528)'', or simply after the first name, ''<nowiki>''</nowiki>Wonwoo ssi<nowiki>''</nowiki> (\uc6d0\uc6b0 \uc528)'' if the speaker is more familiar with someone. Appending ''ssi'' to the surname, for instance  <nowiki>''</nowiki>Jeon ssi<nowiki>''</nowiki> (\uc804 \uc528) can be quite rude, as it indicates the speaker considers himself to be of a higher social status than the person he is speaking to.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ri |first=Ui-do (\ub9ac\uc758\ub3c4) |title=Proper Procedures for Korean Usage (\uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub9d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ubc95 , Olbareun urimal sayongbeop) |page=182 |publisher=Yedam  |year=2005 |location=Seoul |language=Korean |isbn=89-5913-118-0}}</ref>\n\n===''Nim, -nim''===\n''Nim'' ([[Hangul]]: \ub2d8) (by itself after a proper noun) is the highest form of honorifics and above ''ssi''. ''nim'' will follow addressees' names on letters/emails and postal packages. ''-nim'' (as an affix) is used as a commonplace honorific for guests, customers, clients, and unfamiliar individuals. ''-nim'' is also used towards someone who is revered and admired for having a significant amount of skill, intellect, knowledge, etc. and is used for people who are of a higher rank than oneself. Examples include family members (''eomeonim'' \uc5b4\uba38\ub2d8 & ''abeonim'' \uc544\ubc84\ub2d8), teachers (''seonsaengnim'' \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8), holy men (e.g. pastors \u2013 ''moksanim'' \ubaa9\uc0ac\ub2d8), and [[Deity|gods]] (''haneunim'' \ud558\ub290\ub2d8 / hananim \ud558\ub098\ub2d8).\n\n===''Seonbae/hubae''===\n''Seonbae'' (\uc120\ubc30, \u5148\u8f29) is used to address senior colleagues or mentor figures relating to oneself (e.g. older students in school, older/more experienced athletes, mentors, senior colleagues in academia, business, work, etc.). As with English titles such as Doctor, Seonbae can be used either by itself or as a title. ''Hubae'' (\ud6c4\ubc30, \u5f8c\u8f29) is used to refer to juniors.\n\n===''Gun/yang''===\n''Gun'' (\uad70, \u541b) is used moderately in formal occasions (such as weddings), for young, unmarried males. ''gun'' is also used to address young boys by an adult. ''yang'' (\uc591, \u5b43) is the female equivalent of ''gun'' and is used to address young girls.

[[Korean grammar]] uses an extensive system of [[honorific]]s to reflect the speaker's relationship to the subject of the sentence and [[Korean speech levels|speech levels]] to reflect the speaker's relationship to the audience. Originally, the honorifics expressed the differences in social status between speakers. In contemporary [[culture of Korea|Korean culture]], honorifics are used to differentiate between the formal and informal speech based on the level of familiarity between the speaker and the listener ([[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]]).\n\n==Honorific nouns==\n\nWhen talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer must indicate the subject's superiority by using special nouns or verb endings. Generally, someone is superior in status if he or she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, an employer, a teacher, a customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he or she is a younger stranger, a student, an employee or the like. The use of wrong speech levels or diction is likely to be considered insulting, depending on the degree of difference between the used form and the expected form.\n\nOne way of using honorifics is to use special \"honorific\" nouns in place of regular ones. A common example is using [[wikt:\uc9c4\uc9c0|\uc9c4\uc9c0]] (''jinji'') instead of [[wikt:\ubc25|\ubc25]] (''bap'') for \"food\". Often, honorific nouns are used to refer to relatives. The honorific suffix [[wikt:\ub2d8|-\ub2d8]] (''-nim'') is affixed to many kinship terms to make them honorific.  Thus, someone may address his own grandmother as [[wikt:\ud560\uba38\ub2c8|\ud560\uba38\ub2c8]] (''halmeoni'') but refer to someone else's grandmother as [[wikt:\ud560\uba38\ub2d8|\ud560\uba38\ub2d8]] (''halmeonim'').\n\n{|\n!

These include [[wikt:\ub4dc\ub9ac\ub2e4|\ub4dc\ub9ac\ub2e4]] (''deurida'') and [[wikt:\uc62c\ub9ac\ub2e4|\uc62c\ub9ac\ub2e4]] (''ollida'') for [[wikt:\uc8fc\ub2e4|\uc8fc\ub2e4]] (''juda'', \"give\"). \ub4dc\ub9ac\ub2e4 (''deurida'') is substituted for \uc8fc\ub2e4 (''juda'') when the latter is used as an [[auxiliary verb]], while \uc62c\ub9ac\ub2e4 (''ollida'', literally \"raise up\") is used for \uc8fc\ub2e4 (''juda'') in the sense of \"offer\".\n\n==Honorific forms of address==\n[[Korean pronouns|Pronouns in Korean]] have their own set of polite equivalents (e.g., [[wikt:\uc800|\uc800]] (''jeo'') is the humble form of [[wikt:\ub098|\ub098]] (''na'', \"I\") and [[wikt:\uc800\ud76c|\uc800\ud76c]] (''jeohui'') is the humble form of [[wikt:\uc6b0\ub9ac|\uc6b0\ub9ac]] (''uri'', \"we\")). However, Korean language allows for coherent syntax without pronouns, effectively making Korean a so-called [[pro-drop language]], thus Koreans usually avoid using the second-person singular pronoun, especially when using honorific forms. Third-person pronouns are occasionally avoided as well, mainly to maintain a sense of politeness. Although honorific form of [[wikt:\ub108|\ub108]] (''neo'', singular \"you\") is [[wikt:\ub2f9\uc2e0|\ub2f9\uc2e0]] (''dangsin'', literally, \"friend\" or \"dear\"), that term is used only as a form of address in a few specific social contexts, such as between people who are married to each other, or in an ironic sense between strangers. Other words are usually substituted where possible (e.g., the person's name, a [[Kinship terminology|kinship term]], a professional title, the plural [[wikt:\uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84|\uc5ec\ub7ec\ubd84]] ''yeoreobun'', or no word at all, relying on context to supply meaning instead).\n\n===Spacing spelling convention===\nThe [[National Institute of Korean Language]] classifies ''nim/ssi/gun/yang'' as dependent nouns that follow a [[proper noun]], and they [[Linguistic prescription|prescribe]] that a space should appear between a noun and its dependent noun. (e.g. ''Jihye nim'' \uc9c0\ud61c \ub2d8) This is not to be confused with the affix ''-nim'' used with [[common noun]]s, since [[affix]]es are written without spaces. (e.g. ''seonsaengnim'' \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8)\n\n===''-A'' / -''ya''===\nKorean has the [[vocative case]] markers which grammatically identify a person (animal, object etc.) being addressed so that they eliminate possible grammatical ambiguities. ''-a'' or ''-ya'' ([[Hangul]]: \uc544, \uc57c) is a casual title used at the end of names. It is not gender exclusive. If a name ends in a consonant ''-a'' is used (e.g. ''Changsub-a'' \ucc3d\uc12d\uc544), while -''ya'' is used if the name ends in a vowel (e.g. ''Jihye-ya'' \uc9c0\ud61c\uc57c). -''a /'' -''ya'' is used only between close friends and people who are familiar with each other, and its use between strangers or distant acquaintances would be considered extremely rude. -''ya /'' -''a'' is only used hierarchically horizontally or downwards: an adult or parent may use it for young children, and those with equal social standing may use it with each other, but a young individual will not use -''a'' or -''ya'' towards one who is older than oneself.\n\n[[Middle Korean]] had three classes of the vocative case but practically only -\uc544 / -\uc57c is remaining in everyday life. -\uc5ec / -\uc774\uc5ec is only used in literature and archaic expressions, and -\ud558 has completely disappeared. See [[Vocative case#Korean|Korean vocative case]] for more information.\n\n===''Ssi''===\n''Ssi'' (\uc528, \u6c0f) is the most commonly used honorific used amongst people of approximately equal speech level. It is attached after the full name, such as '''Jeon Wonwoo ssi<nowiki>''</nowiki> (\uc804\uc6d0\uc6b0 \uc528)'', or simply after the first name, ''<nowiki>''</nowiki>Wonwoo ssi<nowiki>''</nowiki> (\uc6d0\uc6b0 \uc528)'' if the speaker is more familiar with someone. Appending ''ssi'' to the surname, for instance  <nowiki>''</nowiki>Jeon ssi<nowiki>''</nowiki> (\uc804 \uc528) can be quite rude, as it indicates the speaker considers himself to be of a higher social status than the person he is speaking to.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Ri |first=Ui-do (\ub9ac\uc758\ub3c4) |title=Proper Procedures for Korean Usage (\uc62c\ubc14\ub978 \uc6b0\ub9ac\ub9d0 \uc0ac\uc6a9\ubc95 , Olbareun urimal sayongbeop) |page=182 |publisher=Yedam  |year=2005 |location=Seoul |language=Korean |isbn=89-5913-118-0}}</ref>\n\n===''Nim, -nim''===\n''Nim'' ([[Hangul]]: \ub2d8) (by itself after a proper noun) is the highest form of honorifics and above ''ssi''. ''nim'' will follow addressees' names on letters/emails and postal packages. ''-nim'' (as an affix) is used as a commonplace honorific for guests, customers, clients, and unfamiliar individuals. ''-nim'' is also used towards someone who is revered and admired for having a significant amount of skill, intellect, knowledge, etc. and is used for people who are of a higher rank than oneself. Examples include family members (''eomeonim'' \uc5b4\uba38\ub2d8 & ''abeonim'' \uc544\ubc84\ub2d8), teachers (''seonsaengnim'' \uc120\uc0dd\ub2d8), holy men (e.g. pastors \u2013 ''moksanim'' \ubaa9\uc0ac\ub2d8), and [[Deity|gods]] (''haneunim'' \ud558\ub290\ub2d8 / hananim \ud558\ub098\ub2d8).\n\n===''Seonbae/hubae''===\n''Seonbae'' (\uc120\ubc30, \u5148\u8f29) is used to address senior colleagues or mentor figures relating to oneself (e.g. older students in school, older/more experienced athletes, mentors, senior colleagues in academia, business, work, etc.). As with English titles such as Doctor, Seonbae can be used either by itself or as a title. ''Hubae'' (\ud6c4\ubc30, \u5f8c\u8f29) is used to refer to juniors.\n\n===''Gun/yang''===\n''Gun'' (\uad70, \u541b) is used moderately in formal occasions (such as weddings), for young, unmarried males. ''gun'' is also used to address young boys by an adult. ''yang'' (\uc591, \u5b43) is the female equivalent of ''gun'' and is used to address young girls. Both are used in a similar fashion to ''ssi'', following either the whole name or the first name in solitude.\n\n===-''jjang''===\n''-jjang'' (\uc9f1) is the Korean version of the Japanese honorific suffix \"''-chan'' (\u3061\u3083\u3093)\".\n\n===Less common forms of address===\n* ''Gwiha'' (\uadc0\ud558, \u8cb4\u4e0b) can be seen commonly in formal letters, often used by a company to a client.\n* ''Gakha'' (\uac01\ud558, \u95a3\u4e0b) is used only in extremely formal occasions, usually when addressing presidents, high officials, or bishops and archbishops.

'' 2: 671-86.</ref>\n\n==Definition==\nThe general definition of the elasticity of X with respect to Y is <math>E^X_Y = \\frac{\\%\\ \\mbox{change in   X}}{\\%\\ \\mbox{change in   Y}}</math>, which reduces to <math>E^X_Y = \\frac{dX}{dY} \\frac{Y}{X}</math> for infinitesimal changes and differentiable variables. The elasticity of substitution is the change in the ratio of the use of two goods with respect to the ratio of their marginal values or prices. The most common application is to the ratio of of capital (K) and labor (L)  used with respect to the ratio of the ratio of their marginal products <math>MP_K</math> and <math>MP_L</math>  or of the rental price (r) and the wage (w). Another application is to the ratio of consumption goods 1 and 2 with respect to the ratio of their marginal utilities or their prices. We will start with the consumption application. \n\nLet the utility over consumption be given by <math>U(c_1,c_2)</math> and let <math>U_{c_i}=d U(c_1,c_2)/d{c_i}</math>.

On the other hand, assuming the goods in question are not [[Giffen good]]s, a rise in the relative price of <math>c_2</math> leads to a fall in relative demand for <math>c_2</math>, so that the quantity of <math>c_2</math> purchased falls, which reduces expenditure on <math>c_2</math>.\n\nWhich of these effects dominates depends on the magnitude of the elasticity of substitution. When the elasticity of substitution is less than one, the first effect dominates: relative demand for <math>c_2</math> falls, but by proportionally less than the rise in its relative price, so that relative expenditure rises. In this case, the goods are [[Complementary good|gross complements]].\n\nConversely, when the elasticity of substitution is greater than one, the second effect dominates: the reduction in relative quantity exceeds the increase in relative price, so that relative expenditure on <math>c_2</math> falls.

The elasticity of substitution is the change in the ratio of the use of two goods with respect to the the ratio of their marginal values or prices. The most common application is to the ratio of of capital (K) and labor (L)  used with respect to the ratio of the ratio of their marginal products <math>MP_K</math> and <math>MP_L</math>  or of the rental price (r) and the wage (w). Another application is to the ratio of consumption goods 1 and 2 with respect to the ratio of their marginal utilities or their prices. We will start with the consumption application. \n\nLet the utility over consumption be given by <math>U(c_1,c_2)</math> and let <math>U_{c_i}=d U(c_1,c_2)/d{c_i}</math>.

Election campaigns spend significant sums in the media, and oppressive regimes nearly always seek to control the media. It is a very powerful means of persuasion. Prior to Chomsky's propaganda model, [[George Orwell]] noted: \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\" /> This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.. \n\nThere is recent evidence to suggest that newer media portals (as opposed to those outlets of \"traditional\" [[mainstream media]]) are turning more readily to using the PMC framework in critical analysis and interpretation of media behavior.

Where the less influential ones are not necessarily less self-congratulatory, they are certainly more inward-looking and always carry the label of national specificity.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\">Hedetoft, Ulf. \"Contemporary Cinema: Between Cultural Globalisation and National Interpretation.\" ''Cinema and Nation''. Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280</ref> He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its \"national-cultural currency\" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a \"positive admixture\" to other countries' cultures and identities or a \"model for emulation.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/> He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua Franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/>\n\n===Propaganda===\n{{Main|Propaganda}}\nPropaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\">Furhammar, p. 152.</ref> Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\nSuch British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the \"masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]\" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\n[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from \"[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]\", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]\nWhen sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{Original research inline|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\">Furhammar, p. 153.</ref>\n\nFalsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the \"reality\" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI \"Operation Abolition,\" 1960 - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]\", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]\", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.</ref> in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The F\u00fchrer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.<ref>Furhammar, p. 154.</ref>\n\n[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.<ref>Giroux, p. 29</ref> What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in \"Breaking into the Movies,\" is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\">Giroux, p. 31</ref> He argues, \"We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values.\"<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\"/>\n\nThough feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\"/>\n\n===Anti-politics in film===\nDespite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.<ref>Lindholm, p. 32</ref> Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to \"develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action\" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.<ref>Lindholm, p. 33</ref>\n\n[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', 1939]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34</ref> In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34-35</ref> After the hero of ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.<ref>Lindholm, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.<ref>Lindholm, p. 40</ref> Lindholm and Hall observe that \"the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States\" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.<ref>Lindholm, p. 42</ref> Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\">Lindholm, p. 43</ref> Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/> Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/>\n\n===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===\nWhile films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.<ref>Giroux, p. 19</ref> One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.<ref>Giroux, p. 20-21</ref>\n\n===Actor-politicians===\n{{Main|List of actor-politicians}}\n\n==Television==\n\n===Role of television in United States presidential elections===\nThe [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Du |first1=Yueying |title=From Television to Twitter: How Media Influence the Presidential Election in the United States {{!}} Center for Mobile Communication Studies |url=https://sites.bu.edu/cmcs/2017/11/16/from-television-to-twitter-how-media-influence-the-presidential-election-in-the-united-states/ |website=sites.bu.edu}}</ref> As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\">Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}</ref>\n\nThis transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n\nRick Shenkman also analyzes the media's impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that \"politicians have repeatedly misled voters\" by \"[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation.\"<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]\n\nThrough setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation's political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.<ref name=\"agenda\">McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.</ref> For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.<ref name=\"agenda\" /> When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.</ref>\n\n===Political influence on religion via television===\nIn his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in \"shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present\" in India.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\">Rajagopal, Arvind. \"Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India.\" Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.</ref>\n\nRajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that \"television profoundly changes the context of politics\".<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>(p.&nbsp;24)</sup>\n\nThe epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;43</sup> This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.\n\nCentral to the BJP's success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/> This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.\n\n===Television and politics around the world===\nIn the \u201cDramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,\u201d Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation's television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation's television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\">Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].</ref>\n\nThe main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\"/>\n\nAnother group who studied the impact of television on politics included [[Holli Semetko]] and [[Patti Valkenburg]]. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are \"conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information.\"<ref>Neuman et al., 1992, p.&nbsp;60</ref> They set the parameters \"in which citizens discuss public events.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;IV</ref> They are \"persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion.\"<ref>Gitlin, 1980, p.&nbsp;7</ref> Framing is selecting \"some aspects of a perceived reality\" to enhance their salience \"in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.\"<ref>Entman, 1993, p.&nbsp;53</ref> Frames are to help audiences \"locate, perceive, identify, and label\" the flow of information around them (Goffman, 1974, p.&nbsp;21) and to \"narrow the available political alternatives.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;156</ref><ref name=\"Semetko\">Semetko, Holli A. and Valkenburg, Patti M. \u201cFraming European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.\u201d Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.</ref>\n\nNews frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&nbsp;\u2013 such as its organization, content, or structure&nbsp;\u2013 make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.<ref>Price et al., 1997, p.&nbsp;486</ref> Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/>\n\nLike agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis \"expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news.\"<ref name=\"Semetko\"/><ref>Pan & Kosicki, 1993, p.&nbsp;70; emphasis in the original</ref> The results of Semetko and Valkenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/> After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.\n\n==Internet==\n\n===Impact on political media===\nThe Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people.<ref>{{cite book |title= Handbook of Political Communication Research |last=Kaid |first=Lynda |year=2004 |publisher=Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3775-2 |page=508 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ffqEaH6UM7UC&pg=PP1}}</ref> It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily.<ref>{{cite book |title=Democracy online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet |last=Shane |first=Peter |year=2004 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-94864-9 |page=89}}</ref> However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.<ref name=name>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Volume 1 |last= Kaid |first=Lynda |author2=Holtz-Bacha, Christina |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5 |page=334|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-woKG0HTstwC&pg=PT350}}</ref>\n\nThe relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics ''and'' media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhaps less than flattering, maybe 'adjusted' by one or more ''other'' entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).\n<ref name=\"mpsexpenses\">\n{{Cite news\n | title = MPs accused of Wikipedia expenses 'cover-up'\n | work=Daily Telegraph\n  | date = 8 May 2010\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/7696484/MPs-accused-of-Wikipedia-expenses-cover-up.html\n | accessdate =15 August 2011\n | first1=Rebecca\n | last1=Lefort\n | first2=Ben\n | last2=Leapman\n}}</ref>\n\nFor example, [[Wikipedia]] itself is a major global channel, currently being around the eighth most visited website, in 2009 found its objectivity being compromised at the highest levels with a 'conflict of interest' of a sitting member of the influential [[Wikipedia:AC|Arbitration Committee]](ArbCom).

Boothroyd was forced to step down from the Arbitration Committee, although he claimed he had already asserted his intention to resign.\n\nThe impact of the internet on politics has been notable, as this form of media has more current information than others since it is constantly being updated. Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past. Political Information available on the internet covers every major activity of American politics. Users, nonetheless, remain susceptible to bias, especially on websites that represent themselves as objective sources.<ref name=\"name\"/>\n\n[[File:Bill Clinton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bill Clinton]] was the first [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] to utilize the [[Internet]] in a national campaign and to appoint a Director of Email and Electronic Publishing.]]\n[[E-mail]] has achieved a large scale of usage amongst numerous levels of government, political groups, and even media companies as a means of communicating with the public and thus plays a significant role in the political-media complex. The boom of e-mail hit the Internet and the public in the mid-1990s as a way to keep in touch with family and friends. Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day. In order to deal with the influx of e-mail a more sophisticated system was put in.

Around 2004 blogging became more mainstream and was typically used for political interaction.

Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary [[conventional wisdom]], with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has also argued that the \"two sectors\" represent an \"innocent fraud\")<ref name=\"galbraith\">{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Bernhut|title=An Interview With John Kenneth Galbraith|url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/leadership/an-interview-with-john-kenneth-galbraith|work=Ivey Business Journal|date=May\u2013June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=The myth of the two sectors, the public sector and the private sector... at a time when the private sector has taken over big chunks of the public sector, particularly in military operations and armament, defense budget.

It\u2019s not specifically military.}}</ref> and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the \"military\" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.\n\nUsing the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.\n\nObserving the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).\n\nChomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.\n\nChomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.\n\n[[Edward S. Herman]] (with Chomsky) advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' hypothesis in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', in which they try to demonstrate the ways in which power and money manage to filter the news and aid governments and private interests. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.\n\nHerman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.\n\nThus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) \u2013 a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.<ref name=\"chomsky2\">{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.

Eds. Mette Hjort and Scott Mackenzie. New York: Routledge, 2000. p. 280</ref> He goes on, however, to say that these more transnationally powerful films actually become de-nationalized as a result of its \"national-cultural currency\" more widely and easily dispersed, mixing with other cultures, becoming either a \"positive admixture\" to other countries' cultures and identities or a \"model for emulation.\"<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/> He compares national cinema that undergoes such processes to English becoming a global lingua Franca: the cultural sharing that results is [[Hegemony|hegemonic]] and the globalizing process is non-symmetrical.<ref name=\"Hedetoft, Ulf 2000. p. 280\"/>\n\n===Propaganda===\n{{Main|Propaganda}}\nPropaganda is a way that politics can be represented and manipulated in film. Leif Furhammar and Folke Isaksson credit Russian producers [[Sergei Eisenstein]] and [[Vsevolod Pudovkin]] with the birth of propaganda aesthetics, for which the underlying assumption was that by manipulating cinematic images representing reality, they could manipulate spectators' concepts of reality.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\">Furhammar, p. 152.</ref> Documentaries can be an even more effective form of propaganda than other [[genre]] films because the form of representation claims to mirror reality, making the manipulation of an audience that much more obscured.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\nSuch British newsreels as ''[[The Battle of the Somme]]'' of [[World War I]] were propaganda because they only showed the war from their own perspective, though it can be argued as being more honest and objective than more recent war documentaries (for they were edited without adjustments for [[drama]]tic or epic effect).{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Their photographers remained on their front lines, therefore presenting at least some truth.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> According to Furhammar and Isaksson, it was Russian filmmakers who were the \"masters of [[Soviet montage theory|montage]]\" who discovered film's power to create convincing illusion with cutting, rhythmic editing, and a didactic approach.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/>\n\n[[File:WWII Divide and Conquer 2.jpg|thumb|A scene from \"[[Divide and Conquer (newsreel)|Divide and Conquer]]\", the third installment of [[Why We Fight]], 1943.]]\nWhen sound became possible, documentaries have been said to become more politically powerful with the use of speakers' voices and music.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> In Nazi Germany, newsreels were just as important as feature films, while in Fascist Italy propaganda was mostly limited to documentaries.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 152\"/> A comparison of the first three installments of the American series ''[[Why We Fight]]'' and the Nazi documentary ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' (''Victory in the West'') demonstrates how convincing even two opposing interpretations of the same events can be.{{Original research inline|date=June 2013}} The first covers years in a couple of hours but its density disguises any omission of truth while the latter manages to depict war with real images but without blood or death. The same is found in documentaries about the Spanish Civil War.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\">Furhammar, p. 153.</ref>\n\nFalsification of political matter in documentaries can be created by lifting shots of events other than the one being dealt with and including them in the film so that they appear to be a part of the \"reality\" it claims to represent. The [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]], for example, did this with ''Operation Abolition''<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeiW63M3bcI \"Operation Abolition,\" 1960 - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,894425-1,00.html Operation Abolition]\", ''Time'' magazine, 1961.</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXsCfYYi2FE Operation Abolition (1960) - YouTube]</ref><ref>\"[https://matiane.wordpress.com/2010/08/19/operation-abolition/ Operation Abolition]\", video.google.com and ''Time'' magazine, Friday, Mar. 17, 1961.</ref> in 1960 and Nazi newsreels depicted scenes of the Allies' defeat at Dieppe as real scenes from the Normandy invasion just a few days afterward to convince audience of the Reich's success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Audience's political affiliations can also be manipulated by actually staging the ostensibly real events as the 1944 Nazi picture ''The F\u00fchrer Gives the Jews a Town'' did.<ref>Furhammar, p. 154.</ref>\n\n[[World War II]] propaganda persisted 30 years after [[Dachau]] and [[Auschwitz]] such as in the thinly disguised fascist Italian film ''[[The Night Porter]]'' (1974). The film sought to legitimize the Nazis' genocide, while glorifying sadism, brutality, and machismo.<ref>Giroux, p. 29</ref> What amazes [[Henry Giroux]], as he explains in \"Breaking into the Movies,\" is that such blatant ideological messages were ignored by critics and the general public. That society may be incapable of testing the present against the past has implications for post-industrial oppression in the West and the strategies for resisting it. Despite the writings of [[Antonio Gramsci]], [[Herbert Marcuse]], and [[Paulo Freire]], the majority of Americans (at least) do not recognize how important class [[hegemony]], or cultural domination, is in nations where populations are kept obedient to governments through ideological means.<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\">Giroux, p. 31</ref> He argues, \"We are not only victims in the political and material sense, but are also tied emotionally and intellectually to the prevailing ruling-class norms and values.\"<ref name=\"Giroux, Henry A. 2002. p. 31\"/>\n\nThough feature forms of propaganda lack documentaries' ostensible authenticity they can retain political power because directors' resources are less limited and they can create the reality of the film.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} They further compensate for lack of credibility with intensity.<ref name=\"Furhammar, p. 153\"/>\n\n===Anti-politics in film===\nDespite the strong patriotism and nationalism of Americans, overtly political films have never been popular in the U.S. while films that have represented politics inconspicuously (such as in the form of propaganda) have remained popular.<ref>Lindholm, p. 32</ref> Besides [[Frank Capra]], no other major American filmmaker has seriously presented central themes of citizenship, participation, and responsibility in civic life amidst the complexities and corruption of the political world.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} While Capra sought to \"develop a positive American cinematic vocabulary for political action\" of the individual, as Charles Lindholm and John A. Hall describe, he ultimately failed.<ref>Lindholm, p. 33</ref>\n\n[[File:James Stewart in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington trailer 2.JPG|thumb|A scene from Capra's ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', 1939]]Capra's films are characterized by the same basic formula according to which the fundamental American values of fairness and honesty are challenged by the corruption and cruelty of politics.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} Ronald Reagan later extensively quoted the speech made by Mr. Deeds in ''[[Mr. Deeds Goes to Town]]'' (1936) in which he expresses his disgust with the complexities of politics and calls for individual goodness.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34</ref> In his next film ''[[Mr. Smith Goes to Washington]]'', (1939) Capra reinforces the integrity and decency of the everyman who can transcend politics despite the power and crookedness of special interest groups.<ref>Lindholm, p. 34-35</ref> After the hero of ''[[Meet John Doe]]'' realizes his need for others, he discovers and attempts to expose a fascist bidder for presidency planning to take advantage of his club support. He fails, however, in the midst of a violent mob with the depressing conclusion that the American public is a credulous crowd, susceptible to manipulation until the John Doe club members come begging his forgiveness and convince him to return to lead them.<ref>Lindholm, p. 36</ref>\n\nThe ending of ''John Doe'' was unsuccessful amongst audiences and critics, discouraging any more political films for Capra and no films of merit after ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]''. Capra's ultimate fall from filmmaking and his advice that all American filmmakers should forget politics if they do not want to cut themselves in half signify the challenge filmmakers face when they attempt to criticize politics.<ref>Lindholm, p. 40</ref> Lindholm and Hall observe that \"the problems that defeated Capra have also undercut later attempts by American filmmakers to portray the complex relationship between individualism and citizenship in the United States\" and claim that Hollywood has instead adopted the paranoia of politics that Capra had tried to overcome.<ref>Lindholm, p. 42</ref> Consequently, political films in the U.S. have followed a trend of focusing on the flawed character of leaders, such a films like ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' (1940) and ''[[Nixon (film)|Nixon]]'' (1995).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\">Lindholm, p. 43</ref> Otherwise, they show the corruption of power, such as in ''[[The Candidate (1972 film)|The Candidate]]'' (1972) and ''[[Primary Colors (film)|Primary Colors]]'' (1998).<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/> Other films, like ''A Face in a Crowd'' (1957) and ''[[All the King's Men]]'' (1949), follow the warning of ''John Doe''. ''[[JFK (film)|JFK]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1962), on the other hand, are based on the premise that democracy is an illusion and Americans are the ignorant pawns of various conspiracies involving, for example, the collusion between the government and the media.<ref name=\"Lindholm, p. 43\"/>\n\n===The depoliticizing effect of cinema===\nWhile films can be overtly political they can also depoliticize and oversimplify what is inherently complex, such as class struggle. Film, as it contributes to [[mass culture]], has been criticized{{According to whom|date=June 2013}} for reducing the concept of class to stereotypes and predictable formulas that promote superficial understandings of ideology. Such misrepresentation and the ignorance that it promotes and perpetuates has been said to make audiences and citizens vulnerable to manipulative tactics of politicians in a reality that is complex.<ref>Giroux, p. 19</ref> One of the exceptions to oversimplification and ideological flattening in cinema has been said to be ''[[Norma Rae]]'' (1979), a film that presents a truer representation than is conventional of the complexities and politics of the working-class struggle and culture at the level of everyday life.<ref>Giroux, p. 20-21</ref>\n\n===Actor-politicians===\n{{Main|List of actor-politicians}}\n\n==Television==\n\n===Role of television in United States presidential elections===\nThe [[mass media]] have always influenced the political process, but never more so than with the innovation of the television.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Du |first1=Yueying |title=From Television to Twitter: How Media Influence the Presidential Election in the United States {{!}} Center for Mobile Communication Studies |url=https://sites.bu.edu/cmcs/2017/11/16/from-television-to-twitter-how-media-influence-the-presidential-election-in-the-united-states/ |website=sites.bu.edu}}</ref> As it is the most popular means by which voters obtain information on candidates and the news in general, television is a powerful means by which political groups can influence the public.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\">Heard, Alexander and Nelson, Michael, eds. ''Presidential Selection.'' United States of America: [[Duke University Press]], 1987. {{ISBN|0-8223-0750-2}}</ref>\n\nThis transformation first kicked off in the early 1960s, when newscast programs were increased to a thirty-minute programs, which allowed for greater news coverage and capacity. This expanded time slot allowed more focus to be given to presidential candidates, and network news soon became the center of national politics coverage. Because newscasts were national, the aired [[political campaign]]s were able to impact viewers across the country, enlarging the realm of influence.<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n\nRick Shenkman also analyzes the media's impact on politics in his book, ''Just How Stupid Are We?: Facing the Truth About the American Voter'', and observes that although American voters have gained significant political power over the last 50 years, their knowledge of politics and world affairs have decreased, which makes them more vulnerable to manipulation, and claims that \"politicians have repeatedly misled voters\" by \"[[dumbing down]] of American politics via marketing, spin machines, and misinformation.\"<ref name=\"Presidential Selection\"/>\n[[File:Kennedy Nixon Debat (1960).jpg|thumb|[[John F. Kennedy]] and [[Richard Nixon]] in the first televised presidential candidates' debate. 1960.]]\n\nThrough setting news priorities, the news media play a significant role in determining the nation's political reality; they provide the political information that will be regarded as fact and indicate to viewers how much importance to attach to each topic according to how much air time they dedicate to a given issue and the emphasis they place on it.<ref name=\"agenda\">McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2, 110.</ref> For example, television news is able to offer cues on topic salience by deciding what the opening story on the newscast will be or by altering the length of time devoted a story.<ref name=\"agenda\" /> When these cues are repeated broadcast after broadcast, day after day, they may be able to effectively communicate the amount of importance broadcasters want each topic to have.<ref>McCombs, Maxwell E. and Shaw, Donald L. \"The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media.\" ''Public Opinion Quarterly'', 1972, XXXVI.2.</ref>\n\n===Political influence on religion via television===\nIn his book, ''Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India,'' Arvind Rajagopal examines Hindu nationalism during the late 1980s and 1990s in India. Rajagopal analyzed the role of the media in the public's construction of national, cultural, class, and regional identity. More specifically, he studied the hegemonic role of the [[Ram Janmabhumi]] movement and how the Ram project was played out on Indian national television. In his study, Rajagopal found that the Ram project played a role in \"shaping discourses about national and cultural identities through the 1990s to the present\" in India.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\">Rajagopal, Arvind. \"Politics After Television: Religious Nationalism and the Reshaping of the Public in India.\" Cambridge, United Kingdom: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2001.</ref>\n\nRajagopal investigated the cultural and political economy of [[Television in India|television in contemporary India]]. His discussion of television revolves around the industrial and cultural politics of the serialized epic [[Ramayan]]. The serial epic, which generated unprecedented viewership, was based on the epic story of the Hindu god [[Rama|Ram]] and aired on [[Doordarshan]], India's state-run television. Rajagopal made the argument that the national telecast of the Hindu religious epic Ramayan during the late 1980s provided much of the ideological groundwork for the launch of the Ram Janmabhumi movement. To defend his argument, Rajagopal stated that \"television profoundly changes the context of politics\".<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>(p.&nbsp;24)</sup>\n\nThe epic was broadcast on national television, sponsored by the ruling [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] government. Rajagopal argues that the Congress assumed that the mere sponsorship of the epic would aid its electoral future by bringing in the majority Hindu vote. Quite the opposite happened, however. Rather, it was the electorally weak Hindu nationalist political body, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), that benefited from the serial's popularity. The BJP did so by avoiding the [[Framing (social sciences)|media effects framework]] attempted by Congress and instead articulating a complex relationship between the televised Hindu epic and its own [[Hindu nationalist]] beliefs. The BJP mobilized the public around the symbol of Ram, the lead figure of the serial, but strategically reworked the symbol via the Ram Janmabhumi movement to articulate cultural authenticity, national belonging, and a renewed sense of national purpose and direction. Articulating the temple restoration project within its electoral promise, the BJP, not surprisingly, went on to form the national government in the next general election.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/><sup>p.&nbsp;43</sup> This illustrates that, as Rajagopal argues, television is capable of profoundly impacting politics.\n\nCentral to the BJP's success was the party's strategic use of using both the media and the market, by creating merchandise such as stickers, buttons, and audio tapes centering on the key figure of the Ram. Rajagopal argues that the televised epic also dealt with the tension between the past and the present at many levels. This can be seen in the reworking of the epic story of the Ram to fit the conventions of modern commercial television. In addition to this, the epic was laced with twenty minutes of advertising both before and after the program, which helped the serial to reconstruct the past through technologies of the present.<ref name=\"Rajagopal\"/> This key fact highlights the power of advertisements in the media.\n\n===Television and politics around the world===\nIn the \u201cDramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt,\u201d Lila Abu-Lughod suggests that a nation's television should be studied to answer larger questions about the culture, power, and modern self-fashioning of that nation. Abu-Lughod focuses on the Egyptian nation and investigates the elements of developmentalist ideology and the dreams of national progress that dominated Egyptian television in the past. She analyzes the nation's television broadcasts and highlights the attempt to depict authentic national culture and the intentional strategies for fighting religious extremism.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\">Abu-Lughod, Lila (2005). ''Dramas of Nationhood: The Politics of Television in Egypt''. Chicago: The [[University of Chicago Press]].</ref>\n\nThe main cultural form that binds together the Egyptian nation is, surprisingly, television serials. These serials are melodramatic programs, similar to American soap operas but more closely tied to political and social issues than their Western counterparts. Their contents reflect the changing dynamics of Islam, gender relations, and everyday life in the Middle Eastern nation of Egypt, while at the same time trying to influence and direct these changes.<ref name=\"Abu-Lughod\"/>\n\nAnother group who studied the impact of television on politics included [[Holli Semetko]] and [[Patti Valkenburg]]. In their studies, they analyzed the framing of press and television news in European politics. For reader clarification, they provided the best working definitions of news frames as defined from a wide range of sources. News frames are \"conceptual tools which media and individuals rely on to convey, interpret and evaluate information.\"<ref>Neuman et al., 1992, p.&nbsp;60</ref> They set the parameters \"in which citizens discuss public events.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;IV</ref> They are \"persistent selection, emphasis, and exclusion.\"<ref>Gitlin, 1980, p.&nbsp;7</ref> Framing is selecting \"some aspects of a perceived reality\" to enhance their salience \"in such a way as to promote a particular problem definition, causal interpretation, moral evaluation, and/or treatment recommendation.\"<ref>Entman, 1993, p.&nbsp;53</ref> Frames are to help audiences \"locate, perceive, identify, and label\" the flow of information around them (Goffman, 1974, p.&nbsp;21) and to \"narrow the available political alternatives.\"<ref>Tuchman, 1978, p.&nbsp;156</ref><ref name=\"Semetko\">Semetko, Holli A. and Valkenburg, Patti M. \u201cFraming European Politics: A content Analysis of Press and Television News.\u201d Journal of Communication, Vol. 50, 2000.</ref>\n\nNews frames have what is known as the [[Framing (social sciences)|framing effect]]. Framing effects are when relevant attributes of a message&nbsp;\u2013 such as its organization, content, or structure&nbsp;\u2013 make particular thoughts applicable, resulting in their activation and use in evaluations.<ref>Price et al., 1997, p.&nbsp;486</ref> Framing has shown to have large effects on people's perceptions, and has also been shown to shape public perceptions of political issues or institutions.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/>\n\nLike agenda-setting research, framing analysis focuses on the relationship between public policy issues in the news and the public perceptions of these issues. However, framing analysis \"expands beyond agenda-setting research into what people talk or think about by examining how they think and talk about issues in the news.\"<ref name=\"Semetko\"/><ref>Pan & Kosicki, 1993, p.&nbsp;70; emphasis in the original</ref> The results of Semetko and Valkenburg's research indicate that the attribution of responsibility frame was most commonly employed by the news. This particular type of framing focuses on making viewers feel a sense of responsibility, in which they feel bound to perform whatever duties are attached to the given role, and feel a sense of moral accountability for not taking on the role.<ref name=\"Semetko\"/> After understanding the attribution of responsibility frame, it is easy to see why it is such a powerful tool to news programs, as it evokes strong emotions within the viewer.\n\n==Internet==\n\n===Impact on political media===\nThe Internet - particularly in the form of the [[World Wide Web]] (the Web) - has given the world a tool for education, communication, and negotiation in political information and political roles and its use by individuals and organizations has increased and continues to increase, greatly. This rapid increase can be compared to the boom of the television and its impact on politics as a form of media. The Internet also opens up a world of commentary and criticism which in turn allows for new and better ideas to circulate amongst many people.<ref>{{cite book |title= Handbook of Political Communication Research |last=Kaid |first=Lynda |year=2004 |publisher=Erlbaum Associates, Inc., Publishers|location=Mahwah, NJ |isbn=0-8058-3775-2 |page=508 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ffqEaH6UM7UC&pg=PP1}}</ref> It gives multidirectional communication, which allows people to stay in connection with organizations or people associated with politics more easily.<ref>{{cite book |title=Democracy online: The Prospects for Political Renewal Through the Internet |last=Shane |first=Peter |year=2004 |publisher=Taylor and Francis Group |location=New York, NY |isbn=0-415-94864-9 |page=89}}</ref> However, there are many controversies regarding the Internet with respect to the PMC as it (the Internet) can encourage and facilitate the practice of providing bits of information extracted from a far wider context or biased information, which leads to public cynicism toward the media.<ref name=name>{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Political Communication, Volume 1 |last= Kaid |first=Lynda |author2=Holtz-Bacha, Christina |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |isbn=978-1-4129-1799-5 |page=334|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=-woKG0HTstwC&pg=PT350}}</ref>\n\nThe relative ease of entry into publishing through Internet/Web channels yields opportunities, for those so inclined, to become, in the extreme, one-person contributors/players, with a foot on both sides of the fence - politics ''and'' media - in the PMC (and sometimes information, placed into the public domain through such channels, about a political entity (politician, party etc.), being perhaps less than flattering, maybe 'adjusted' by one or more ''other'' entities (individuals, organizations etc.) with publishing identities that barely, if at all, conceal a relationship with the political entity in question).\n<ref name=\"mpsexpenses\">\n{{Cite news\n | title = MPs accused of Wikipedia expenses 'cover-up'\n | work=Daily Telegraph\n  | date = 8 May 2010\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/mps-expenses/7696484/MPs-accused-of-Wikipedia-expenses-cover-up.html\n | accessdate =15 August 2011\n | first1=Rebecca\n | last1=Lefort\n | first2=Ben\n | last2=Leapman\n}}</ref>\n\nFor example, [[Wikipedia]] itself is a major global channel, currently being around the eighth most visited website, in 2009 found its objectivity being compromised at the highest levels with a 'conflict of interest' of a sitting member of the influential [[Wikipedia:AC|Arbitration Committee]](ArbCom).

Another advancement is its capacity to have extensive information in one place, like voting records, periodicals, press releases, opinion polls, policy statements, speeches, etc. Obtaining a comprehensive understanding of an election, for example, is more convenient than it has been in the past.

Different governments got a hold of this technology, and in 1993 the [[United States Congress]] and the [[White House]] were using this as communication as a means of communicating with the general public. During the Clinton administration a director for e-mail and electronic publishing was appointed and by the summer of 1993, the White House was receiving 800 e-mails per day.

While the Leveson findings are obviously oriented toward the PMC of the UK, some commentators argue that its findings will have global implications through their relevance to similar existing networks in other countries.<ref name=\"lse1\"/><ref name=\"lse2\"/><ref name=\"lse3\">{{cite web | title=Leveson Round-Up: Over Cosy?

Such identifiable collaborations/collusions are almost to be expected and are a natural outcome to the working of the 'industrial system,' as it has evolved in the West, having the taxpayer-funded sector at its core (that is as opposed to the contemporary [[conventional wisdom]], with a hard and fast distinction between the state and private sectors - the economist [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] has also argued that the \"two sectors\" represent an \"innocent fraud\")<ref name=\"galbraith\">{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Bernhut|title=An Interview With John Kenneth Galbraith|url=http://www.iveybusinessjournal.com/topics/leadership/an-interview-with-john-kenneth-galbraith|work=Ivey Business Journal|date=May\u2013June 2006|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=The myth of the two sectors, the public sector and the private sector... at a time when the private sector has taken over big chunks of the public sector, particularly in military operations and armament, defense budget.

It\u2019s not specifically military.}}</ref> and argues that its embedded behavior is not just about the \"military\" but is about ensuring that the modern economy, of which that behavior (emptied of particularly military connotations) is at the heart, is nothing much to do with [[Political freedom|freedom]] (of choice) or [[democracy]] either.\n\nUsing the technology of [[computing]] as a prime example, Chomsky notes that about the time [[Dwight Eisenhower]] was making his speech about the putative MIC, institutions like [[Harvard University]] and his own, [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT), were working, using government funds (taxpayer dollars), to reduce roomfuls of machinery into a package that could be sold as a [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] (computer). Reaching that point, project heads began to leave to set up manufacturers. Similarly, established notables like [[International Business Machines]] (IBM) were using public funds to advance their technology from punch card sorting to advanced general purpose computers of their own around the beginning of the 1960s. None of this was about 'consumer choice' since the work was being done for government organs such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA). It was about two and a half decades, the early 1980s, before these 'private tyrannies' were in a position to take all the results of public funding and sell them back, at considerable profit,  to the very people who had already paid for them.\n\nObserving the prophets of the '[[free market]]', such as [[Alan Greenspan]], enthusing about the 'marvels of entrepreneurial initiative and consumer choice,' Chomsky asserts, in contrast, that the contribution here during the 'costly and risky period of development' was precisely nil, almost the entire burden, without any (democratic) consultation, being placed on the taxpayer (socialized).\n\nChomsky points to the same script being followed, now, in areas such as [[biotechnology]] and [[neuroscience]] and why, from the past, we now have such 'goods' as the Internet, [[telecommunications]], [[lasers]] etc. While it may be 'nice' to have computers (or be able to command an aircraft by 'thought') the essential point is, assuming there is some real commitment to freedom (of choice) and democracy in the elites and structures of power, given a public, such as those in the 1950s, to ask what they want out of their taxes. Computers in twenty-five years or health care, good schools and jobs today ? This assumes their being informed, in good faith, of matters.\n\nChomsky summarizes that anybody or anything deeply embedded in the interests of the industrial system, with power (such as the corporations), is 'deathly afraid' of admitting such a state of affairs and that attitudes must be manipulated towards the 'appropriate' outcomes. Such manipulation is often best done in an atmosphere of [[fear mongering|fear]] and under pretence of external threat.\n\n[[Edward S. Herman]] (with Chomsky) advanced a '[[propaganda model]]' hypothesis in ''[[Manufacturing Consent]]'', in which they try to demonstrate the ways in which power and money manage to filter the news and aid governments and private interests. Earlier, political writer [[George Orwell]] had noted, \"All the papers that matter live off their advertisements and the advertisers exercise an indirect censorship over the news.\"<ref name=\"orwell\">{{cite book|first1=George|last1=Orwell|authorlink1=George Orwell|title=Why I Write|chapter=The Lion and the Unicorn: Socialism And The English Genius|chapterurl=http://www.george-orwell.org/The_Lion_and_the_Unicorn:_Socialism_And_The_English_Genius/0.html|accessdate=21 September 2011}}</ref> ('Indirect censorship' obviates the need for obvious coercion.) This observation is at the heart of two of the filters that structure the propaganda model: advertising (of corporations) as the primary source of income for the mass media and the dependence upon information provided by government, business and 'experts' approved and paid for by these primary sources.\n\nHerman and Chomsky see the ideas as being cast as testable [[hypothesis|hypotheses]] such that they can be held in the light of corroboration through empirical evidence and not merely as assertions out of the blue. Examination of contemporary developments in the context of the hypotheses is encouraged.\n\nThus the general and fundamental understanding of the working of the industrial system in the modern economy, 'socialization of costs and privatization of profits', is met with corroboration from the heart of the [[market system]] (often called the free market) \u2013 a contemporary and 'polite' euphemism for [[capitalism]] according to Galbraith - for example, in the near collapse of the global banking system, beginning in 2008, spreading in 2011 to the areas of [[Government debt|sovereign debt]], requiring almost constant appeal to the '[[lender of last resort|banker of last resort]]' - the taxpayer. Under debt restructuring, 'good debt' is returned to private hands as soon as possible and the taxpayer is left saddled with the 'bad debt' which is probably unrecoverable.<ref name=\"chomsky2\">{{cite news|first=Sameer|last=Dossani|title=Chomsky:Understanding the Crisis -- Markets, the State and Hypocrisy|url=http://chomsky.info/interviews/20090210.htm|work=Foreign Policy in Focus|date=10 February 2009|accessdate=29 September 2011|quote=It's true across the board from electronics to pharmaceuticals to the new biology-based industries.

{"title_page": "Relative clause", "text_new": "Stinky balls}}A '''relative clause''' is a kind of [[subordinate clause]] that contains the element whose interpretation is provided by an [[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] on which the subordinate clause is grammatically [[dependent (grammar)|dependent]]; that is, there is an [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] relation between the relativized element in the relative clause and antecedent on which it depends.<ref name=\"HP183\">Rodney D. Huddleston, Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''A Student's Introduction to English Grammar'', CUP 2005, p. 183ff.</ref>\n\nTypically, a relative clause modifies a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]],<ref name=\"HP183\" /> and uses some grammatical device to indicate that one of the arguments within the relative clause has the same referent as that noun or noun phrase. For example, in the sentence ''I met a man who wasn't there'', the subordinate clause ''who wasn't there'' is a relative clause, since it modifies the noun ''man'', and uses the pronoun ''who'' to indicate that the same \"man\" is referred to within the subordinate clause (in this case, as its [[subject (grammar)|subject]]).\n\nIn many European languages, relative clauses are introduced by a special class of [[pronoun]]s called ''[[relative pronoun]]s'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Kurzov\u00e1 |first=Helena |year=1981 |language=German |title=Der Relativsatz in den indoeurop\u00e4ischen Sprachen |trans-title=Relative Clauses in the Indo-European Languages |series= |location=Hamburg |publisher=Buske |page=117 |isbn=3-87118-458-6 |oclc=63317519}}</ref> such as ''who'' in the example just given. In other languages, relative clauses may be marked in different ways: they may be introduced by a special class of conjunctions called ''[[relativizer]]s''; the main verb of the relative clause may appear in a special morphological variant; or a relative clause may be indicated by word order alone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehmann |first=Christian |year=1984 |language=German |title= Der Relativsatz |trans-title=Relative Clauses |series=Language universals series; vol. 3 |location=T\u00fcbingen |publisher=G. Narr |page=438 |isbn=3-87808-982-1 |oclc=14358164}}</ref> In some languages, more than one of these mechanisms may be possible.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Bound and free===\nA '''bound relative clause''', the type most often considered, qualifies an explicit element (usually a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]]) appearing in the main clause, and refers back to that element by means of some explicit or implicit device within the relative clause.\n\nThe relative clause may also function as an ''embedded clause'' within a main (or higher-level) clause, thereby forming a ''matrix sentence''.<ref name=\"Glossary of Linguistic Terms \">Matrix Sentence, ''http://www.glossary.sil.org/term/matrix-sentencer''</ref> The noun in the main clause that the relative clause modifies is called the ''[[Head (grammar)|head]] noun'', or (particularly when referred back to by a relative pronoun) the ''[[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]''.\n\nFor example, in the English sentence \"The man whom I saw yesterday went home\", the relative clause \"whom I saw yesterday\" modifies the head noun ''man'', and the relative pronoun ''whom'' refers back to the referent of that noun. The sentence is equivalent to the following two sentences: \"I saw a man yesterday. The man went home.\" The shared argument need not fulfill the same role in both clauses; in this example the same man is referred to by the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the matrix clause, but the [[direct object]] of the relative clause.\n\nA '''free relative clause''', on the other hand, does not have an explicit antecedent external to itself. Instead, the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause. For example, in the English sentence \"I like what I see\", the clause ''what I see'' is a free relative clause, because it has no antecedent, but itself serves as the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the verb ''like'' in the main clause. (An alternative analysis is that the free relative clause has [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] as its antecedent.)\n\n===Restrictive and non-restrictive===\nBound relative clauses may or may not be [[restrictive]]. Whereas a '''non-restrictive''' or '''non-defining''' relative clause merely provides supplementary information, a '''restrictive''' or '''defining''' relative clause modifies the meaning of its head word (restricts its possible referent).  For example:\n*''The man '''who lives in this house''' has not been seen for days.'' This (''who lives in this house'') is a restrictive relative clause, modifying the meaning of ''man'', and essential to the sentence (if the clause were omitted, it would no longer be known which man is being referred to). If the bold part is deleted the remaining part does not provide the sense.\n*''The mayor, '''who lives in this house''', has not been seen for days.'' This is a non-restrictive relative clause, since it provides supplementary information about the mayor, but is not essential to the sentence \u2013 if the clause were omitted, it would still be known which mayor is meant.  If the bold part is deleted the remaining part provides the sense.\n\nIn speaking it is natural to make slight pauses around non-restrictive clauses, and in English this is shown in writing by [[comma]]s (as in the examples). However many languages do not distinguish the two types of relative clause in this way. Another difference in English is that only restrictive relative clauses may be introduced with ''that'' or use the \"zero\" relative pronoun (see [[English relative clauses]] for details).\n\nIn colloquial speech, a non-restrictive relative clause may have a whole sentence as its antecedent rather than a specific noun phrase; for example:\n*''The cat was allowed on the bed, '''which annoyed the dog'''.''\nHere, the context of the sentence (presumably) indicates that ''which'' refers not to the bed or the cat but to the entire [[proposition]] expressed in the main clause, namely the circumstance that the cat was allowed on the bed. Such constructions are discouraged in formal usage and in texts written for nonnative speakers because of the potential for [[syntactic ambiguity|ambiguity]] in parsing; a construction more accepted in formal usage would be ''The cat's being ''[or ''having been''] ''allowed on the bed annoyed the dog.''\n\n===Finite and non-finite===\nRelative clauses may be either finite clauses (as in the examples above) or [[non-finite clause]]s. An example of a non-finite relative clause in English is the [[infinitive clause]] ''on whom to rely'', in the sentence \"She is the person on whom to rely\".\n\n==Formation methods==\nLanguages differ in many ways in how relative clauses are expressed:\n#How the role of the shared noun phrase is indicated in the embedded clause.\n#How the two clauses are joined together.\n#Where the embedded clause is placed relative to the head noun (in the process indicating which noun phrase in the main clause is modified).\n\nFor example, the English sentence \"The man that I saw yesterday went home\" can be described as follows:\n#The role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated by ''gapping''; that is, a gap is left in the object position after \"saw\", implying that the shared noun phrase (\"the man\") is to be understood to fill that gap and to serve as the object of the verb \"saw\".\n#The clauses are joined by the ''complementizer'' \"that\".\n#The embedded clause is placed ''after'' the head noun \"the man\".\n\nThe following sentences indicate various possibilities (only some of which are grammatical in English):\n*\"The man [that I saw yesterday] went home\". (A ''complementizer'' linking the two clauses with a ''gapping'' strategy indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. One possibility in English. Very common cross-linguistically.)\n*\"The man [I saw yesterday] went home\". (Gapping strategy, with no word joining the clauses&mdash;also known as a [[reduced relative clause]]. One possibility in English. Used in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] when the head noun is [[definiteness|indefinite]], as in \"a man\" instead of \"the man\".)\n*\"The man [whom I saw yesterday] went home\". (A [[relative pronoun]] indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause\u2014in this case, the direct object. Used in formal English, as in [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] or [[Russian language|Russian]].)\n*\"The man [seen by me yesterday] went home\". (A [[reduced relative clause]], in this case [[passive voice|passivized]]. One possibility in English.)\n*\"The man [that I saw him yesterday] went home\". (A complementizer linking the two sentences with a [[resumptive pronoun]] indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause, as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Persian language|Persian]].)\n*\"The man [that him I saw yesterday] went home\". (Similar to the previous, but with the resumptive pronoun fronted. This occurs in modern [[Greek language|Greek]] and as one possibility in modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the combination ''that him'' of complementizer and resumptive pronoun behaves similar to a unitary relative pronoun.)\n*\"The [I saw yesterday]'s man went home\". (Preceding relative clause with gapping and use of a possessive particle\u2014as normally used in a [[genitive construction]]\u2014to link the relative clause to the head noun. This occurs in many Sino-Tibetan languages and possibly developed from \"relative clause + noun\" > \"nominalized clause + noun\" > \"genitive construction\".<ref>http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_4_03_2641.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_4_05_5653.pdf</ref>)\n*\"The [I saw yesterday] man went home\". (Preceding relative clause with gapping and no linking word, as in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].)\n*\"The man [of my seeing yesterday] went home\". ([[Nominalization|Nominalized]] relative clause, as in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].)\n*\"[Which man I saw yesterday], that man went home\". (A ''correlative'' structure, as in [[Hindi]].)\n*\"[I saw the man yesterday] went home.\" (An ''unreduced, internally headed'' relative clause, as in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] or [[Navajo language|Navajo]].)\n\n===Strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun in the relative clause===\nThere are four main strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun phrase in the embedded clause. These are typically listed in order of the degree to which the noun in the relative clause has been reduced, from most to least:\n\n# Gap strategy or gapped relative clause\n# Relative pronoun\n# Pronoun retention\n# Nonreduction\n\n====Gapped relative clause====\nIn this strategy, there is simply a gap in the relative clause where the shared noun would go. This is normal in English, for example, and also in Chinese and Japanese. This is the most common type of relative clause, especially in [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|verb-final]] languages with prenominal relative clauses, but is also widespread among languages with postnominal externally headed relative clauses.\n\nThere may or may not be any marker used to join the relative and main clauses. (Languages with a case-marked relative pronoun are technically not considered to employ the gapping strategy even though they do in fact have a gap, since the case of the relative pronoun indicates the role of the shared noun.) Often the form of the verb is different from that in main clauses and is to some degree nominalized, as in Turkish and in English [[reduced relative clause]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last=Carrol | first=David W | edition=5 | title=Psychology of Language | publisher=Thomson & Wadsworth | location=Belmont | year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Townsend | first=David J |author2=Thomas G Bever  | title=Sentence Comprehension: The Integration of Habits and Rules | year=2001 | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | pages=247&ndash;9}}</ref>\n\nIn non-verb-final languages, apart from languages like [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, gapped relative clauses tend, however, to be restricted to positions high up in the accessibility hierarchy. With obliques and genitives, non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention. English is unusual in that ''all'' roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping: e.g. \"I saw the man who is my friend\", but also (in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically, according to the ''[[accessibility hierarchy]]'' described below) \"...&nbsp;who I know\", \"...&nbsp;who I gave a book to\", \"...&nbsp;who I spoke with\", \"...&nbsp;who I run slower than\". Usually, languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy, and switch to a different strategy at this point. [[Classical Arabic]], for example, only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object; beyond that, a resumptive pronoun must be used. Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point\u2014e.g. in many [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause. In these languages, relative clauses with shared nouns serving \"disallowed\" roles can be expressed by [[passive voice|passivizing]] the embedded sentence, thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position. This, for example, would transform \"The man who I gave a book to\" into \"The man who was given a book by me\". Generally, languages such as this \"conspire\" to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from ''all'' positions \u2014 hence a sentence equivalent to \"The man who is run slower than by me\" is grammatical. Gapping is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns (since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause), but this is not necessary (e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer).\n\n====Relative pronoun type====\nThis is in fact a type of gapped relative clause, but is distinguished by the fact that the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated indirectly by the case marking of the marker (the [[relative pronoun]]) used to join the main and embedded clauses. All languages which use relative pronouns have them in clause-initial position: though one could conceivably imagine a clause-final relative pronoun analogous to an adverbial subordinator in that position, they are unknown.\n\nSome languages have what are described as \"relative pronouns\" (in that they agree with some properties of the head noun, such as number and gender) but which do not actually indicate the case role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. [[Classical Arabic]] in fact has \"relative pronouns\" which are case-marked, but which agree in case with the ''head'' noun. Case-marked relative pronouns in the strict sense are almost entirely confined to [[Standard Average European|European languages]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, where they are widespread except among the [[Celtic languages|Celtic family]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan family]]. The influence of Spanish has led to their adaption by a very small number of [[indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], of which the best-known are the [[Keresan languages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_aco|title=WALS Online - Language Acoma|author=|date=|website=wals.info|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Pronoun retention type====\nIn this type, the position relativized is indicated by means of a [[personal pronoun]] in the same syntactic position as would ordinarily be occupied by a noun phrase of that type in the main clause\u2014known as a ''[[resumptive pronoun]]''. It is equivalent to saying \"The man who I saw <u>him</u> yesterday went home\". Pronoun retention is very frequently used for relativization of inaccessible positions on the accessibility hierarchy. In [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Classical Arabic]], for example, resumptive pronouns are required when the embedded role is other than the subject or direct object, and optional in the case of the direct object. Resumptive pronouns are common in non-verb-final [[languages of Africa]] and Asia, and also used by the Celtic languages of northwest Europe and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (\"Omul pe care <u>l</u>-am v\u0103zut ieri a mers acas\u0103\"/\"The man who I saw <u>him</u> yesterday went home\"). They also occur in deeply embedded positions in English, as in \"That's the girl that I don't know what <u>she</u> did\",<ref name=\"mckee\">{{citation|title=Resumptive Pronouns in English Relative Clauses|first1=Cecile|last1=McKee|first2=Dana|last2=McDaniel|journal=Language Acquisition|volume=9|number=2|year=2001|pages=113\u2013156|doi=10.1207/s15327817la0902_01}}.</ref> although this is sometimes considered non-standard.\n\nOnly a very small number of languages, of which the best known is [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], have pronoun retention as their sole grammatical type of relative clause.\n\n====Nonreduction type====\nIn the nonreduction type, unlike the other three, the shared noun occurs as a ''full-fledged noun phrase'' in the embedded clause, which has the form of a full independent clause. Typically, it is the head noun in the main clause that is reduced or missing. Some languages use relative clauses of this type with the normal strategy of embedding the relative clause next to the head noun. These languages are said to have ''internally headed'' relative clauses, which would be similar to the (ungrammatical) English structure \"[You see the girl over there] is my friend\" or \"I took [you see the girl over there] out on a date\". This is used, for example, in [[Navajo language|Navajo]], which uses a special relative verb (as with some other Native American languages).\n\nA second strategy is the ''correlative''-clause strategy used by [[Hindi]] and other [[Indo-Aryan languages]], as well as [[Bambara language|Bambara]]. This strategy is equivalent to saying \"Which girl you see over there, she is my daughter\" or \"Which knife I killed my friend with, the police found that knife\". It is \"correlative\" because of the corresponding \"which ... that ...\" demonstratives or \"which ... she/he/it ...\" pronouns, which indicate the respective nouns being equated. The shared noun can either be repeated entirely in the main clause or reduced to a pronoun. There is no need to front the shared noun in such a sentence. For example, in the second example above, Hindi would actually say something equivalent to \"I killed my friend with which knife, the police found that knife\".\n\nDialects of some European languages, such as Italian, do use the nonreduction type in forms that could be glossed in English as \"The man just passed us by, he introduced me to the chancellor here.\"\n\nIn general, however, nonreduction is restricted to verb-final languages, though it is more common among those that are [[head-marking language|head-marking]].\n\n===Strategies for joining the relative clause to the main clause===\nThe following are some of the common strategies for joining the two clauses:\n*Use of an indeclinable particle (specifically, a [[relativizer]]) inserted into the sentence, placed next to the modified noun; the embedded clause is likewise inserted into the appropriate position, typically placed on the other side of the complementizer. This strategy is very common and arguably occurs in English with the word ''that'' (\"the man that I saw\"), though this interpretation of \"that\" as something other than a relative pronoun is controversial (see [[#English|below]]). In the modern [[varieties of Arabic]] (using ''illi'' placed after the modified noun); in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (using ''de'' placed before the modified noun).\n*Use of a [[relative pronoun]]. Prototypically, a relative pronoun agrees with the head noun in gender, number, definiteness, animacy, etc., but adopts the [[grammatical case|case]] that the shared noun assumes in the ''embedded'', not matrix, clause. This is the case in a number of conservative European languages, such as [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Many languages also have similar linking words commonly termed \"relative pronouns\" that agree in some way with the head noun, but do not adopt the case role of the embedded clause. In English, for example, the use of ''who'' vs. ''which'' agrees with the animacy of the head noun, but there is no case agreement except in the formal English contrast ''who'' vs. ''whom'' (which is often used incorrectly, if at all, in speech). Similarly, in [[Classical Arabic]], there is a relative pronoun that agrees in number, gender, [[definiteness]] ''and'' case with the head noun (rather than taking the case role of the noun in the embedded clause). Languages with prototypical relative pronouns typically use the gapping strategy for indicating the role in the embedded clause, since the relative pronoun itself indicates the role by its case. ([[Classical Arabic]], where the case marking indicates something else, uses a [[resumptive pronoun]].) Some linguists prefer to use the term ''relative pronoun'' only for the prototypical cases (but in this case it's unclear what to call the non-prototypical cases).\n*Directly inserting the embedded clause in the matrix clause at the appropriate position, with no word used to join them. This is common, for example, in English (cf. \"The man I saw yesterday went home\"), and is used in [[Classical Arabic]] in relative clauses that modify indefinite nouns.\n*By [[nominalization|nominalizing]] the relative clause (e.g. converting it to a participial construction). Generally, no relative pronoun or complementizer is used. This occurs, for example, in [[reduced relative clause]]s in English (e.g. \"The man seen by me yesterday went home\" or \"The man planning to go home soon is my friend\"). Formal German makes common use of such participial relative clauses, which can become extremely long. This is also the normal strategy in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which has sentences equivalent to \"I ate the potato of Hasan's giving to Sina\" (in place of \"I ate the potato that Hasan gave to Sina\"). This can be viewed as a situation in which the \"complementizer\" is attached to the verb of the embedded clause (e.g. in English, \"-ing\" or \"-ed\" can be viewed as a type of complementizer).\n\n===Position of the head noun with respect to the relative clause===\nThe positioning of a relative clause before or after a head noun is related to the more general concept of [[Branching (linguistics)|branching]] in linguistics. Languages that place relative clauses after their head noun (so-called ''head-initial'' or ''VO'' languages) generally also have adjectives and [[genitive construction|genitive modifier]]s following the head noun, as well as verbs preceding their objects. [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are prototypical languages of this sort. Languages that place relative clauses before their head noun (so-called ''head-final'' or ''OV'' languages) generally also have adjectives and [[genitive construction|genitive modifier]]s preceding the head noun, as well as verbs following their objects. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are prototypical languages of this sort. Not all languages fit so easily into these categories. English, for example, is generally head-first, but has adjectives preceding their head nouns, and [[genitive construction]]s with both preceding and following modifiers (\"the friend of my father\" vs. \"my father's friend\"). [[Chinese language|Chinese]] has the ''VO'' order, with verb preceding object, but otherwise is generally head-final.\n\nVarious possibilities for ordering are:\n*Relative clause following the head noun, as in English, [[French language|French]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]].\n*Relative clause preceding the head noun, as in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or [[Chinese language|Chinese]].\n*Head noun ''within'' the relative clause (an ''internally headed'' relative clause). An example of such a language is [[Navajo language|Navajo]]. These languages are said to have [[#Nonreduction type|nonreduced]] relative clauses. These languages have a structure equivalent to \"[I saw the man yesterday] went home\".\n*Adjoined relative clause. These languages have the relative clause completely outside the main clause, and use a correlative structure to link the two. These languages also have [[#Nonreduction type|nonreduced]] relative clauses. [[Hindi]] is the most well known such language, and have a structure similar to \"Which man I saw yesterday, that man went home\" or (with non-fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause) \"I saw which man yesterday, that man went home\". Another example is [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]], which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to \"I saw the man yesterday, which he was going home\". However, it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all, since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as  \"I saw the man who was going home yesterday\" or \"I saw the man yesterday when/while he was going home\".\n\n==Accessibility hierarchy==\nThe antecedent of the relative clause (that is, the noun that is modified by it) can in theory be the subject of the main clause, or its object, or any other [[verb argument]]. In many languages, however, especially rigidly [[left-branching]], [[dependent-marking language]]s with prenominal relative clauses,<ref>Lehmann, Christian (1986). On the typology of relative clauses. ''Linguistics'', 24(4), 663-680. {{doi|10.1515/ling.1986.24.4.663}}</ref> there are major restrictions on the role the antecedent may have ''in the relative clause''.\n\n[[Edward Keenan]] and [[Bernard Comrie]] noted that these roles can be ranked cross-linguistically in the following order from most accessible to least accessible:<ref>Keenan, Edward L. & Comrie, Bernard (1977). Noun phrase accessibility and Universal Grammar, [[Linguistic Inquiry]], 8(1), 63-99</ref><ref>Comrie, Bernard; ''Language Universals and Linguistic Typology''; pp. 156-163; {{ISBN|0-226-11434-1}}</ref>\n\n:Subject  > Direct Object  > Indirect Object  > Oblique  > Genitive  > Object of comparative\n\n[[Ergative\u2013absolutive]] languages have a similar hierarchy:\n\n:[[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] > [[Ergative case|Ergative]] > Indirect Object > etc. (same as above)\n\nThis order is called the '''accessibility hierarchy'''. If a language can relativize positions lower in the accessibility hierarchy, it can always relativize positions higher up, but not vice versa. For example, [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] can relativize only subject and [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] only absolutive arguments, whilst [[Basque language|Basque]] can relativize absolutives, ergatives and indirect objects, but not obliques or genitives or objects of comparatives. Similar hierarchies have been proposed in other circumstances, e.g. for pronominal reflexes.\n\n[[English language|English]] can relativize all positions in the hierarchy. Here are some examples of the NP and relative clause usage from English:\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n!Position !! With explicit relative pronoun !! With omitted relative pronoun !! In formal English\n|-\n|[[subject (grammar)|Subject]] || That's the man [who ran away]. || \u2014 || That's the man [who ran away].\n|-\n|[[Direct object]] || That's the man [who I saw yesterday]. || That's the man [I saw yesterday]. || That's the man [whom I saw yesterday].\n|-\n|[[Indirect object]] || That's the man [who I gave the letter to]. || That's the man [I gave the letter to]. || That's the man [to whom I gave the letter]. \n|-\n|[[oblique case|Oblique]] || That's the man [who I was talking about].  || That's the man [I was talking about]. || That's the man [about whom I was talking]. \n|-\n|[[Genitive]] || That's the man [whose sister I know].\t       || \u2014 ||  That's the man [whose sister I know].\n|-\n|Obj of Comp || That's the man [who I am taller than].\t\t       || That's the man [I am taller than]. || That's the man [than whom I am taller].\n|}\n\nSome other examples:\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n!Position !! Example\n|-\n|[[subject (grammar)|Subject]] || The girl [who came late] is my sister.\n|-\n|[[Direct object]]  || I gave a rose to the girl [that Kate saw].\n|-\n|[[Indirect object]] || John knows the girl [I wrote a letter to].\n|-\n|[[oblique case|Oblique]] || I found the rock [which the robbers had hit John over the head with].\n|-\n|[[Genitive]] || The girl [whose father died] told me she was sad.\n|-\n|Obj of Comp || The first person [I can't run faster than] will win a million dollars.\n|}\n\nLanguages that cannot relativize directly on noun phrases low in the accessibility hierarchy can sometimes use alternative [[grammatical voice|voices]] to \"raise\" the relevant noun phrase so that it can be relativized. The most common example is the use of [[applicative voice]]s to relativize obliques, but in such languages as Chukchi [[antipassive voice|antipassives]] are used to raise ergative arguments to absolutive.\n\nFor example, a language that can relativize only subjects could say this:\n*The girl [who likes me] came to visit.\nBut not:\n*The girl [whom I like] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I gave a rose to] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I watched a movie with] came to visit.\n*The girl [whose father I know] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I know the father of] came to visit. (''equivalent to previous'')\n*The girl [whom I am taller than] came to visit.\nThese languages might form an equivalent sentence by [[passive voice|passivization]]:\n*The girl [who was liked by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was given a rose by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was watched a movie with by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was known the father of by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was been taller than by me] came to visit.\nThese passivized sentences get progressively more ungrammatical in English as they move down the accessibility hierarchy; the last two, in particular, are so ungrammatical as to be almost unparsable by English speakers. But languages with severe restrictions on which roles can be relativized are precisely those that can passivize almost any position, and hence the last two sentences would be normal in those languages.\n\nA further example is languages that can relativize only subjects and direct objects. Hence the following would be possible:\n*The girl [who I like] came to visit.\nThe other ungrammatical examples above would still be ungrammatical. These languages often allow an oblique object to be moved to the direct object slot by the use of the so-called ''[[applicative voice]]'', much as the [[passive voice]] moves an oblique object to the subject position. The above examples expressed in an applicative voice might be similar to the following (in not necessarily grammatical English):\n*The girl [who I gave a rose] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I with-watched a movie] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I (of-)know the father] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I out-tall] came to visit.\n\nModern grammars may use the accessibility hierarchy to order productions\u2014e.g. in [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]] the hierarchy corresponds to the order of elements on the ''subcat'' list, and interacts with other principles in explanations of binding facts. The hierarchy also figures in\n[[Lexical Functional Grammar]], where it is known as Syntactic Rank or the Relational Hierarchy.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Indo-European languages===\n\n====English====\n{{main|English relative clauses}}\nIn English, a relative clause follows the noun it modifies. It is generally indicated by a relative pronoun at the start of the clause, although sometimes simply by word order. If the relative pronoun is the object of the verb in the relative clause, it comes at the beginning of the clause even though it would come at the end of an independent clause (\"He is the man ''whom'' I saw\", not \"He is the man I saw ''whom''\").\n\nThe choice of relative pronoun can be affected by whether the clause modifies a human or non-human noun, by whether the clause is restrictive or not,<ref>{{cite book |last=Kordi\u0107 |first=Snje\u017eana |authorlink=Snje\u017eana Kordi\u0107 |editor1-last=Suprun |editor1-first=Adam E |url-status=live |editor2-last=Jachnow |editor2-first=Helmut |title=Slavjano-germanskie jazykovye paralleli/Slawisch-germanische Sprachparallelen |series=Sovmestnyj issledovatel'skij sbornik slavistov universitetov v Minske i Bochume |publisher=Belorusskij gosudarstvennyj universitet |page=165 |language=German |chapter=Pronomina im Antezedenten und Restriktivit\u00e4t/Nicht-Restriktivit\u00e4t von Relativs\u00e4tzen im Kroatoserbischen und Deutschen |trans-chapter=Pronouns in antecedents and restrictive / non-restrictive relative clauses in Serbo-Croatian and German |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426662.PRONOMINA_IM_ANTEZEDENT.PDF |location=Minsk |year=1996 |oclc=637166830 |ssrn=3434472 |id={{CROSBI|426662}} |archivedate=29 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AHPw0DET |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref> and by the role (subject, direct object, or the like) of the relative pronoun in the relative clause.\n\n*For a human antecedent, \"who\", \"whom\", or \"that\" is usually used (\"He is the person ''who'' saw me\", \"He is the person ''whom'' I saw\", \"He is the person ''that'' I saw\"). For a non-human antecedent, only \"that\" or \"which\" is used.\n*For a non-human antecedent in a non-restrictive clause, only \"which\" is used (\"The tree, ''which'' fell, is over there\"); while either \"which\" or \"that\" may be used in a restrictive clause (\"The tree ''which'' fell is over there\", \"The tree ''that'' fell is over there\"){{mdash}}but some styles and prescriptive grammars require the use of \"that\" in the restrictive context.\n*Of the relative pronoun pair \"who\" and \"whom\", the ''subjective'' case form (\"who\") is used if it is the subject of the relative clause (\"He is the policeman who saw me\"); and, in formal usage, the ''objective'' case form (\"whom\") if it is the object of the verb or preposition in the relative clause (\"He is the policeman whom I saw\", \"He is the policeman whom I talked to\", \"He is the policeman to whom I talked\"); but in informal usage \"whom\" is often replaced by \"who\".\n\nIn English, as in some other languages (such as French; see below), [[restrictiveness|non-restrictive]] relative clauses are set off with commas, but restrictive ones are not:\n\n*\"I met a man and a woman yesterday. The woman, ''who had a thick French accent'', was very pretty.\" (non-restrictive\u2014does not narrow down who is being talked about)\n*\"I met two women yesterday, one with a thick French accent and one with a mild Italian one. The woman ''who had the thick French accent'' was very pretty.\" (restrictive\u2014adds information about who is being referred to)\n\nThe status of \"that\" as a relative pronoun is not universally agreed. Traditional grammars treat \"that\" as a relative pronoun, but not all contemporary grammars do: e.g. the [[Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]] (pp.&nbsp;1056\u20137) makes a case for treating \"that\" as a subordinator instead of a relative pronoun; and the [[British National Corpus]] treats \"that\" as a subordinating conjunction even when it introduces relative clauses. One motivation for the different treatment of \"that\" is that there are differences between \"that\" and \"which\" (e.g., one can say \"in which\" but not \"in that\", etc.).\n\n====French====\nThe system of relative pronouns in [[French language|French]] is as complicated as, but similar in many ways to, the system in English.\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the direct object of the relative clause, ''{{lang|fr|que}}'' is generally used, although ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'', which is inflected for grammatical gender and number, is sometimes used in order to give more precision. For example, any of the following is correct and would translate to \"I talked to his/her father and mother, whom I already knew\":\n\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''laquelle''' (f. sing.) je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''lesquels''' (m. pl.) je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''que''' je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n\nHowever, in the first sentence, \"whom I already knew\" refers only to the mother; in the second, it refers to both parents; and in the third, as in the English sentence, it could refer either only to the mother, or to both parents.\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the subject of the relative clause, ''{{lang|fr|qui}}'' is generally used, though as before, ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' may be used instead for greater precision. (This is less common than the use of ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' with direct objects, however, since verbs in French often reflect the grammatical number of their subjects.)\n\nContrary to English, the relative pronoun can never be omitted in French, not even when the relative clause is embedded in another relative clause.\n:Here is what I think '''\u00d8''' happened.\n:''{{lang|fr|Voil\u00e0 ce que je crois '''qui''' est arriv\u00e9.}}'' (literally: \"Here is what I think '''that''' happened.\")\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act in a possessive sense, where the preposition ''de'' (of/from) would normally be used, the pronoun ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' (\"whose\") is used, but does not act as a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] for the noun \"possessed\":\n\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec une femme '''dont''' le fils est mon coll\u00e8gue.}}'' (\"I spoke with a woman whose son I work with.\" - ''lit.'', \"I spoke with a woman ''of whom'' the son is my colleague.\")\n\nThis construction is also used in non-possessive cases where the pronoun replaces an object marked by ''{{lang|fr|de}}'':\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est l'homme '''dont''' j'ai parl\u00e9.}}'' (\"That's the man '''of whom''' I spoke.\")\n\nMore generally, in modern French, ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' can signal the topic of the following clause, without replacing anything in this clause:\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est un homme '''dont''' je crois qu'il doit tr\u00e8s bien gagner sa vie.}}'' (\"That's a man '''about whom''' I believe that he must make a lot of money.\")\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the object of a preposition (other than when ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' is used), ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' is generally used, though ''{{lang|fr|qui}}'' can be used if the antecedent is human.\n\n:''{{lang|fr|Ce sont des gens '''sur lesquels''' on peut compter.}}'' (\"These are people '''that''' can be depended '''on'''.\") [literally: \"'''on whom''' one can depend\"]\n:''{{lang|fr|Ce sont des gens '''sur qui''' on peut compter.}}''\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est une table '''sur laquelle''' on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.}}'' (\"This is a table '''on which''' you can put a lot of things\")\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki>''C'est une table sur qui on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.''\n\nThere exists a further complication when the antecedent is a non-human indefinite pronoun. In that case, ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' cannot be used because it must agree in gender with its head, and an indefinite pronoun has no gender. Instead, ''{{lang|fr|quoi}}'', which usually means \"what\", is used.\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est manifestement <u>quelque chose</u> '''\u00e0 quoi''' il a beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi.}}'' (\"This is obviously <u>something</u> '''that '''he has thought a lot '''about '''.\")\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki>''C'est manifestement quelque chose \u00e0 laquelle il a beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi.''\n\nThe same happens when the antecedent is an entire clause, also lacking gender.\n:''{{lang|fr|Il m'a dit d'aller me faire voir, '''\u00e0 quoi''' j'ai r\u00e9pondu que...}}'' (\"He told me to get lost, '''to which''' I replied that ...\")\n\nThe preposition always appears before the pronoun, and the prepositions ''{{lang|fr|de}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|\u00e0}}'' (at/to) contract with ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' to form ''{{lang|fr|duquel}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|auquel}}'', or with ''{{lang|fr|lesquel(le)s}}'' to form ''{{lang|fr|desquel(le)s}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|auxquel(le)s}}''.\n\n====German====\n[[File:Intonation of German restrictive relative clauses.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] of [[German language|German]] [[#Restrictive and non-restrictive|restrictive relative clauses]]]]Aside from their highly inflected forms, [[German language|German]] relative pronouns are less complicated than English. There are two varieties. The more common one is based on the definite article ''der'', ''die'', ''das'', but with distinctive forms in the genitive (''dessen'', ''deren'') and in the dative plural (''denen''). Historically this is related to English ''that''. The second, which is more literary and used for emphasis, is the relative use of ''welcher'', ''welche'', ''welches'', comparable with English ''which''. As in most Germanic languages, including Old English, both of these varieties inflect according to gender, case and number. They take their gender and number from the noun which they modify, but the case from their function in their own clause.\n\n:''Das Haus, in dem ich wohne, ist sehr alt.''\n::The house in which I live is very old.\n\nThe relative pronoun ''dem'' is neuter singular to agree with ''Haus'', but dative because it follows a preposition in its own clause. On the same basis, it would be possible to substitute the pronoun ''welchem''.\n\nHowever, German uses the uninflecting ''was'' ('what') as a relative pronoun when the antecedent is ''alles'', ''etwas'' or ''nichts'' ('everything', 'something', 'nothing'.).\n\n:''Alles, was Jack macht, gelingt ihm.''\n::Everything that Jack does is a success.\n\nIn German, all relative clauses are marked with commas.\n\nAlternatively, particularly in formal registers, participles (both active and passive) can be used to embed relative clauses in adjectival phrases:\n\n:''Die von ihm in jenem Stil gemalten Bilder sind sehr begehrt''\n::The pictures he painted in that style are highly sought after\n:''Die Regierung m\u00f6chte diese im letzten Jahr eher langsam wachsende Industrie weiter f\u00f6rdern''\n::The government would like to further promote this industry, which has grown rather slowly over the last year\n\nUnlike English, which only permits relatively small participle phrases in adjectival positions (typically just the participle and adverbs), and disallows the use of direct objects for active participles, German sentences of this sort can embed clauses of arbitrary complexity.\n\n====Spanish====\nSee [[Spanish pronouns#Relative pronouns|Relative pronouns]] in the Spanish pronouns article.\n\n====Latin====\nIn [[Latin]], relative clauses follow the noun phrases they modify, and are always introduced using relative pronouns. Relative pronouns, like other pronouns in Latin, agree with their antecedents in [[grammatical gender|gender]] and [[grammatical number|number]], but not in [[grammatical case|case]]: a relative pronoun's case reflects its role in the relative clause it introduces, while its antecedent's case reflects the antecedent's role in the clause that contains the relative clause. (Nonetheless, it is possible for the pronoun and antecedent to be in the same case.) For example:\n\n:'''''Urb\u0113s''', '''quae''' sunt magnae, videntur.

A direct relative clause is used where the relativized element is the subject or the direct object of its clause (e.g. \"the man ''who'' saw me\", \"the man ''whom'' I saw\"), while an indirect relative clause is used where the relativized element is a genitival (e.g. \"the man ''whose'' daughter is in the hospital\") or is the object of a preposition (e.g. \"the man ''to whom'' I gave the book\"). Direct relative clauses are formed with a [[relative pronoun]] (unmarked for case) at the beginning; a gap (in terms of syntactic theory, a [[trace (linguistics)|trace]], indicated by (''t)'' in the examples below) is left in the relative clause at the pronoun's expected position.\n\n;Irish\n{|\n| an || fear || a || chonaic || (''t)'' || m\u00e9\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL || saw || || me\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"the man who saw me\"\n|}\n;Welsh\n{|\n| y || dyn || a || welais\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL || I saw\n|-\n| colspan=4 | \"the man whom I saw\"\n|}\n\nThe direct relative particle \"a\" is not used with \"mae\" (\"is\") in Welsh; instead the form \"sydd\" or \"sy'\" is used:\n\n{|\n| y || dyn || sy'n || blewog || iawn\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL + is || hairy || very \n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"the man who is very hairy\"\n|}\n\nThere is also a defective verb \"piau\" (usually lenited to \"biau\"), corresponding to \"who own(s)\":\n\n{|\n| y || dyn || piau || castell || anferth\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL + owns || castle || huge \n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"the man who owns a huge castle\"\n|}\n\nIndirect relative clauses are formed with a [[relativizer]] at the beginning; the relativized element remains ''in situ'' in the relative clause.\n\n;Irish\n{|\n| an || fear || a || bhfuil || a || in\u00edon || san || ospid\u00e9al\n|-\n| the || man || IND-REL || is || his || daughter || in the || hospital\n|-\n| colspan=8 | \"the man whose daughter is in the hospital\"\n|}\n;Welsh\n{|\n| y || dyn || y || rhois || y || llyfr || iddo\n|-\n| the || man || IND-REL || I gave || the || book || to him\n|-\n| colspan=7 | \"the man to whom I gave the book\"\n|}\n\nAlthough both the Irish relative pronoun and the relativizer are 'a', the relative pronoun triggers lenition of a following consonant, while the relativizer triggers eclipsis (see [[Irish initial mutations]]).\n\nBoth direct and indirect relative particles can be used simply for emphasis, often in answer to a question or as a way of disagreeing with a statement. For instance, the Welsh example above, \"y dyn a welais\" means not only \"the man whom I saw\", but also \"it was the man (and not anyone else) I saw\"; and \"y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo\" can likewise mean \"it was the man (and not anyone else) to whom I gave the book\".\n\n===Semitic languages===\n\n====Hebrew====\nIn [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]], relative clauses were headed with the word ''asher'', which could be either a [[relative pronoun]] or a [[relativizer]]. In later times, ''asher'' became interchangeable with the prefix ''she-'' (which is also used as a conjunction, with the sense of English ''that''), and in [[Modern Hebrew language|Modern Hebrew]], this use of ''she-'' is much more common than ''asher'', except in some formal, archaic, or poetic writing. In meaning, the two are interchangeable; they are used regardless of whether the clause is modifying a human, regardless of their grammatical case in the relative clause, and regardless of whether the clause is restrictive.\n\nFurther, because Hebrew does not generally use its word for ''is'', ''she-'' is used to distinguish adjective phrases used in epithet from adjective phrases used in attribution:\n\n:''Ha-kise l'-yad-kha.'' (\"The chair is next to you.\" - ''lit.'', \"The-chair [is] to-hand-your.\")\n:''Ha-kise '''she-'''l'-yad-kha shavur.'' (\"The chair next to you is broken.\"\u2014''lit.'', \"The-chair '''that'''-[is]-to-hand-your [is] broken.\")\n\n(This use of ''she-'' does not occur with simple adjectives, as Hebrew has a different way of making that distinction. For example, ''Ha-kise adom'' means \"The chair [is] red,\" while ''Ha-kis'e ha-adom shavur'' means \"The red chair is broken\"\u2014literally, \"The chair the red [is] broken.\")\n\nSince 1994, the official rules of Modern Hebrew (as determined by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]) have stated that relative clauses are to be punctuated in Hebrew the same way as in English (described above). That is, non-restrictive clauses are to be set off with commas, while restrictive clauses are not:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev alav, shavur.'' (\"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting on, is broken.\")\n:''Ha-kise '''she-'''ata yoshev alav shavur.'' (\"The chair '''that''' you are sitting on is broken.\")\n\nNonetheless, many, perhaps most, speakers of Modern Hebrew still use the pre-1994 rules, which were based on the German rules (described above). Except for the simple adjective-phrase clauses described above, these speakers set off all relative clauses, restrictive or not, with commas:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev alav, shavur.'' (\"The chair '''that''' you are sitting on is broken,\" ''or'' \"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting on, is broken.\")\n\nOne major difference between relative clauses in Hebrew and those in (for example) English is that in Hebrew, what might be called the \"regular\" pronoun is not always suppressed in the relative clause. To reuse the prior example:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev '''alav''', shavur.'' (''lit.'', \"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting '''on it''', [is] broken.\")\n\nMore specifically, if this pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, it is always suppressed. If it is the direct object, then it is usually suppressed, though it is also correct to leave it in. (If it is suppressed, then the special preposition ''et'', used to mark the direct object, is suppressed as well.) If it is the object of a preposition, it must be left in, because in Hebrew\u2014unlike in English\u2014a preposition cannot appear without its object. When the pronoun is left in, ''she-'' might more properly be called a [[relativizer]] than a relative pronoun.\n\nThe [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[relativizer]] ''she-'' \u2018that\u2019 \"might be a shortened form of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[relativizer]] ''\u2018asher'' \u2018that\u2019, which is related to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''\u2018ashru'' \u2018place\u2019 (cf. Semitic *''\u2018athar'') Alternatively, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''\u2018asher'' derived from ''she-'', or it was a convergence of Proto-Semitic ''dhu'' (cf. Aramaic ''d\u012b'') and ''\u2018asher'' [...] Whereas [[Israeli Hebrew|Israeli]] ''she-'' functions both as [[complementizer]] and [[relativizer]], ''ash\u00e9r'' can only function as a [[relativizer]].\"<ref>A quote from p. 79 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2006), \"Complement Clause Types in Israeli\", ''Complementation: A Cross-Linguistic Typology'', edited by [[R.

Aikhenvald]], [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 72-92 (Chapter 3).</ref>\n\n====Arabic====\n\n=====Literary Arabic=====\nIn [[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Standard]] and [[Classical Arabic]] there is a relative pronoun (in Arabic: {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0648\u0644}} {{transl|ar|DIN|''al-ism al-maw\u1e63\u016bl''}}) ''alla\u1e0f\u012b'' (masculine singular), feminine singular ''allat\u012b'', masculine plural ''alla\u1e0f\u012bna'', feminine plural ''allaw\u0101t\u012b'', masculine dual ''alla\u1e0f\u0101n\u012b'' (nominative) / ''alla\u1e0fayni'' (accusative and genitive), feminine dual ''allat\u0101n\u012b'' (nom.) / ''allatayn\u012b'' (acc. and gen.).\n\nIts usage has two specific rules: it agrees with the antecedent in gender, number and case, and it is used only if the antecedent is definite. If the antecedent is indefinite, no relative pronoun is used. The former is called ''jumlat sila'' (conjunctive sentence) while the latter is called ''jumlat sifa'' (descriptive sentence).\n\n*{{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0631\u0623\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641 \u0623\u0645\u0633 \u063a\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 }}\n:''al-waladu (a)lladhi ra\u2019aytuhu f\u012b (a)\u1e63-\u1e63affi \u2019amsi \u0121\u0101\u2019ibun al-yawma''\n:\"The boy I saw in class yesterday is missing today\".

(relative pronoun absent)\n\n=====Colloquial Arabic=====\nIn Colloquial Arabic the multiple forms of the relative pronoun have been levelled in favour of a single form, a simple conjunction, which in most dialects is ''illi'', and is never omitted. So in Palestinian Arabic the above sentences would be:\n\n* ''alwalad illi shuft\u014d fi (a)ssaff emb\u0101rih gh\u0101yeb aly\u014dm''\n* ''h\u0101da walad illi shuft\u014d fi (a)ssaff emb\u0101rih''\n\nAs in Hebrew, the regular pronoun referring to the antecedent is repeated in the relative clause - literally, \"the boy whom I saw '''him''' in class...\" (the ''-hu'' in ''ra'aituhu'' and the ''-\u014d'' in ''shuft\u014d''). The rules of suppression in Arabic are identical to those of Hebrew: obligatory suppression in the case that the pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, obligatory retention in the case that the pronoun is the object of a preposition, and at the discretion of the speaker if the pronoun is the direct object. The only difference from Hebrew is that, in the case of the direct object, it is preferable to retain the pronoun rather than suppress it.\n\n===Japonic languages===\n\n====Japanese====\nJapanese does not employ relative pronouns to relate relative clauses to their antecedents. Instead, the relative clause directly modifies the noun phrase as an [[attributive verb]], occupying the same syntactic space as an attributive adjective (before the noun phrase).\n\n:\u3053\u306e\u3000\u304a\u3044\u3057\u3044\u3000\u5929\u3077\u3089\n:''kono oishii tempura''\n:\"this delicious [[tempura]]\"\n\n:\u59c9\u304c\u3000\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3000\u5929\u3077\u3089\n:''ane-ga tsukutta tempura''\n:''sister-SUBJ make-PAST tempura''\n:\"the tempura [that] my sister made\"\n\n:\u5929\u3077\u3089\u3092\u3000\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3000\u4eba\n:''tempura-o tabeta hito''\n:''tempura-OBJ eat-PAST person''\n:\"the person who ate the tempura\"\n\nIn fact, since so-called ''i-adjectives'' in Japanese are technically intransitive stative verbs, it can be argued that the structure of the first example (with an adjective) is the same as the others.

In (1a) below, ''lalaki'' 'man' serves as the head, while ''nagbigay ng bigas sa bata'' 'gave rice to the child' is the relative clause.\n\n:{|\n| (1) || a. || '''lalaki''' || =ng || nagbigay || ____ || ng || bigas || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  || man || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave ||  || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=8 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || Nagbigay || ''ang'' || ''lalaki'' || ng || bigas || sa || bata.\n|-\n|  ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=8 | \"The man gave rice to the child.\"\n|}\n\nThe gap inside the relative clause corresponds to the position that the noun acting as the head would have normally taken, had it been in a [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|declarative sentence]]. In (1a), the gap is in subject position within the relative clause. This corresponds to the subject position occupied by ''ang lalaki'' 'the man' in the declarative sentence in (1b).\n\nThere is a constraint in Tagalog on the position from which a noun can be relativised and in which a gap can appear: A noun has to be the subject within the relative clause in order for it to be relativised. The phrases in (2) are ungrammatical because the nouns that have been relativised are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses. In (2a), the gap is in direct object position, while in (2b), the gap is in indirect object position.\n\n:{|\n| (2) || a. || * || '''bigas''' || na || nagbigay || ang || lalaki || ____ || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || rice || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man ||  || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || colspan=8 | for:  \"rice that the man gave to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || * || '''bata''' || =ng || nagbigay || ang || lalaki || ng || bigas || ____\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || child || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice ||\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || colspan=8 | for:  \"child that the man gave rice to\"\n|}\n\nThe correct Tagalog translations for the intended meanings in (2) are found in (3), where the verbs have been passivised in order to raise the logical direct object in (3a) and the logical indirect object in (3b) to subject position.  (Tagalog can have more than one [[Tagalog grammar#Trigger .28voice .2F focus.29|passive voice]] form for any given verb.)\n\n:{|\n| (3) || a. || '''bigas''' || na || ibinigay || ng || lalaki || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  || rice || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|psv}}.gave || {{sc|gen}} || man || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"rice that the man gave to the child\"\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | (or:  \"rice that was given to the child by the man\")\n|-\n|  || b. || '''bata''' || =ng || binigyan || ng || lalaki || ng || bigas\n|-\n|  ||  || child || {{sc|comp}} || gave.{{sc|psv}} || {{sc|gen}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"child that the man gave rice to\"\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | (or:  \"child that was given rice to by the man\")\n|}\n\nTagalog relative clauses can be left-headed, as in (1a) and (3), right-headed, as in (4), or internally headed, as in (5).\n\n:{|\n| (4) || nagbigay || ng || bigas || sa || bata || na || '''lalaki'''\n|-\n|   || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child || {{sc|comp}} || man\n|-\n|  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|}\n\n:{|\n| (5) || a. || nagbigay || na || '''lalaki''' || ng || bigas || sa || bata\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|comp}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || nagbigay || ng || bigas || na || '''lalaki''' || sa || bata\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|comp}} || man || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|}\n\nIn (4), the head, ''lalaki'' 'man', is found after or to the right of the relative clause, ''nagbigay ng bigas sa bata'' 'gave rice to the child'. In (5), the head is found in some position inside the relative clause. When the head appears to the right of or internally to the relative clause, the complementiser appears to the left of the head. When the head surfaces to the left of the relative clause, the complementiser surfaces to the right of the head.\n\nThere are exceptions to the subjects-only constraint to relativisation mentioned above. The first involves relativising the [[Possession (linguistics)|possessor]] of a noun phrase within the relative clause.\n\n:{|\n| (6) || '''bata''' || =ng || nasugatan || ang || daliri || ____\n|-\n|   || child || {{sc|comp}} || injured.{{sc|psv}} || {{sc|nom}} || finger ||\n|-\n|  || colspan=6 | \"child whose finger was injured\"\n|}\n\nIn (6), the head, ''bata'' 'child', is the owner of the injured finger. The phrase ''ang daliri'' 'the finger' is the subject of the verb, ''nasugatan'' 'was injured'.\n\nAnother exception involves relativising the [[Oblique case|oblique]] noun phrase.\n\n:{|\n| (7) || a. || '''ospital''' || (na) || kung || saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || hospital || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|q-comp}} || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"hospital where Juan was born\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || Nagtanong || siya || kung || saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan.\n|-\n|  ||  || {{sc|act}}.asked || {{sc|3sg.nom}} || {{sc|q-comp}} || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"She asked where Juan was born.\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || c. || Ipinanganak || si || Juan || ''sa'' || ''ospital''.\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan || {{sc|loc}} || hospital\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"Juan was born at the hospital.\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || d. || Saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan?\n|-\n|   ||  || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"Where was Juan born?\"\n|}\n\nWhen an oblique noun phrase is relativised, as in (7a), ''na'' 'that', the complementiser that separates the head from the relative clause, is optional. The relative clause itself is also composed differently. In the examples in (1a), and in (3) to (6), the relative clauses are simple declaratives that contain a gap. However, the relative clause in (7a) looks more like an [[Indirect speech|indirect]] [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|question]], complete with the [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|interrogative]] complementiser, ''kung'' 'if', and a pre-verbally positioned [[Interrogative word|WH-word]] like ''saan'' 'where', as in (7b). The sentence in (7c) is the declarative version of the relative clause in (7a), illustrating where the head, ''ospital'' 'hospital', would have been \"before\" relativisation. The question in (7d) shows the direct question version of the [[Dependent clause|subordinate]] indirect question in (7b).\n\n====Hawaiian====\n\nRelative clauses in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]<ref>Alexander, W. D., ''Introduction to Hawaiian Grammar'', Dover, 2004 (originally 1864): 45-47.</ref>  are avoided unless they are short.\n\nIf in English a relative clause would have a copula and an adjective, in Hawaiian the antecedent is simply modified by the adjective: \"The honest man\" instead of \"the man who is honest\". If the English relative clause would have a copula and a noun, in Hawaiian an appositive is used instead: \"Paul, an apostle\" instead of \"Paul, who was an apostle\".\n\nIf the English relative pronoun would be the subject of an intransitive or passive verb, in Hawaiian a participle is used instead of a full relative clause:  \"the people fallen\" instead of \"the people who fell\"; \"the thing given\" instead of \"the thing that was given\". But when the relative clause's antecedent is a person, the English relative pronoun would be the subject of the relative clause, and the relative clause's verb is active and transitive, a relative clause is used and it begins with the relative pronoun ''nana'': ''The one who me (past) sent'' = \"the one who sent me\".\n\nIf in English a relative pronoun would be the object of a relative clause, in Hawaiian the possessive form is used so as to treat the antecedent as something possessed: ''the things of me to have seen'' = \"the things that I saw\"; ''Here is theirs to have seen'' = This is what they saw\".\n\n===Andean languages===\n\n====Aymara====\n{|\n| thuqu\u00f1ap || punchu\n|-\n| dance-INF-3POSS || poncho\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"the poncho he is dancing with\"\n|}\n\n===Chinese===\n\n====Mandarin====\n{{further|Chinese grammar}}\nIn [[Mandarin Chinese]], the relative clause is similar to other adjectival phrases in that it precedes the noun that it modifies, and ends with the relative particle ''de''.

''Pidgin Grammar'', Bess Press, 2003: pp. 102ff.</ref> As in English, a relative pronoun that serves as the object of the verb in the relative clause can optionally be omitted: For example,\n\n:''Ai neva si da buk daet Lisa wen bai''\n:I never see the book that Lisa (past) buy\n:I didn't see the book that Lisa bought\n\ncan also be expressed with the relative pronoun omitted, as\n\n:''Ai neva si da buk Lisa wen bai''\n:I never see the book Lisa (past) buy\n:I didn't see the book Lisa bought\n\nHowever, relative pronouns serving as the subject of a relative clause show more flexibility than in English; they can be included, as is mandatory in English, they can be omitted, or they can be replaced by another pronoun. For example, all of the following can occur and all mean the same thing:\n\n:''Get wan nada grl hu no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl who no can stay still\n:There's another girl who cannot stay still\n\n:''Get wan nada grl no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl no can stay still\n\n:''Get wan nada grl shi no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl she no can stay still\n\n====Gullah====\n\nIn [[Gullah language|Gullah]], an English-based creole spoken along the southeastern coast of the United States, no relative pronoun is normally used for the subject of a relative clause. For example:\n\n:''Duh him cry out so''\n:It him cry out so\n:It's he who cries out so\n\n:''Enty duh dem shum dey?''\n:Ain't it them saw_him there?\n:Isn't it they who saw him there?\n\n==See also==\n*[[Long-distance dependencies]]\n*[[Reduced relative clause]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*[[Rodney Huddleston]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum|Geoffrey K.

Huddleston, Geoffrey K. Pullum, ''A Student's Introduction to English Grammar'', CUP 2005, p. 183ff.</ref>\n\nTypically, a relative clause modifies a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]],<ref name=\"HP183\" /> and uses some grammatical device to indicate that one of the arguments within the relative clause has the same referent as that noun or noun phrase. For example, in the sentence ''I met a man who wasn't there'', the subordinate clause ''who wasn't there'' is a relative clause, since it modifies the noun ''man'', and uses the pronoun ''who'' to indicate that the same \"man\" is referred to within the subordinate clause (in this case, as its [[subject (grammar)|subject]]).\n\nIn many European languages, relative clauses are introduced by a special class of [[pronoun]]s called ''[[relative pronoun]]s'',<ref>{{cite book|last=Kurzov\u00e1 |first=Helena |year=1981 |language=German |title=Der Relativsatz in den indoeurop\u00e4ischen Sprachen |trans-title=Relative Clauses in the Indo-European Languages |series= |location=Hamburg |publisher=Buske |page=117 |isbn=3-87118-458-6 |oclc=63317519}}</ref> such as ''who'' in the example just given. In other languages, relative clauses may be marked in different ways: they may be introduced by a special class of conjunctions called ''[[relativizer]]s''; the main verb of the relative clause may appear in a special morphological variant; or a relative clause may be indicated by word order alone.<ref>{{cite book|last=Lehmann |first=Christian |year=1984 |language=German |title= Der Relativsatz |trans-title=Relative Clauses |series=Language universals series; vol. 3 |location=T\u00fcbingen |publisher=G. Narr |page=438 |isbn=3-87808-982-1 |oclc=14358164}}</ref> In some languages, more than one of these mechanisms may be possible.\n\n==Types==\n\n===Bound and free===\nA '''bound relative clause''', the type most often considered, qualifies an explicit element (usually a [[noun]] or [[noun phrase]]) appearing in the main clause, and refers back to that element by means of some explicit or implicit device within the relative clause.\n\nThe relative clause may also function as an ''embedded clause'' within a main (or higher-level) clause, thereby forming a ''matrix sentence''.<ref name=\"Glossary of Linguistic Terms \">Matrix Sentence, ''http://www.glossary.sil.org/term/matrix-sentencer''</ref> The noun in the main clause that the relative clause modifies is called the ''[[Head (grammar)|head]] noun'', or (particularly when referred back to by a relative pronoun) the ''[[antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]]''.\n\nFor example, in the English sentence \"The man whom I saw yesterday went home\", the relative clause \"whom I saw yesterday\" modifies the head noun ''man'', and the relative pronoun ''whom'' refers back to the referent of that noun. The sentence is equivalent to the following two sentences: \"I saw a man yesterday. The man went home.\" The shared argument need not fulfill the same role in both clauses; in this example the same man is referred to by the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of the matrix clause, but the [[direct object]] of the relative clause.\n\nA '''free relative clause''', on the other hand, does not have an explicit antecedent external to itself. Instead, the relative clause itself takes the place of an argument in the matrix clause. For example, in the English sentence \"I like what I see\", the clause ''what I see'' is a free relative clause, because it has no antecedent, but itself serves as the [[object (grammar)|object]] of the verb ''like'' in the main clause. (An alternative analysis is that the free relative clause has [[zero (linguistics)|zero]] as its antecedent.)\n\n===Restrictive and non-restrictive===\nBound relative clauses may or may not be [[restrictive]]. Whereas a '''non-restrictive''' or '''non-defining''' relative clause merely provides supplementary information, a '''restrictive''' or '''defining''' relative clause modifies the meaning of its head word (restricts its possible referent).  For example:\n*''The man '''who lives in this house''' has not been seen for days.'' This (''who lives in this house'') is a restrictive relative clause, modifying the meaning of ''man'', and essential to the sentence (if the clause were omitted, it would no longer be known which man is being referred to). If the bold part is deleted the remaining part does not provide the sense.\n*''The mayor, '''who lives in this house''', has not been seen for days.'' This is a non-restrictive relative clause, since it provides supplementary information about the mayor, but is not essential to the sentence \u2013 if the clause were omitted, it would still be known which mayor is meant.  If the bold part is deleted the remaining part provides the sense.\n\nIn speaking it is natural to make slight pauses around non-restrictive clauses, and in English this is shown in writing by [[comma]]s (as in the examples). However many languages do not distinguish the two types of relative clause in this way. Another difference in English is that only restrictive relative clauses may be introduced with ''that'' or use the \"zero\" relative pronoun (see [[English relative clauses]] for details).\n\nIn colloquial speech, a non-restrictive relative clause may have a whole sentence as its antecedent rather than a specific noun phrase; for example:\n*''The cat was allowed on the bed, '''which annoyed the dog'''.''\nHere, the context of the sentence (presumably) indicates that ''which'' refers not to the bed or the cat but to the entire [[proposition]] expressed in the main clause, namely the circumstance that the cat was allowed on the bed. Such constructions are discouraged in formal usage and in texts written for nonnative speakers because of the potential for [[syntactic ambiguity|ambiguity]] in parsing; a construction more accepted in formal usage would be ''The cat's being ''[or ''having been''] ''allowed on the bed annoyed the dog.''\n\n===Finite and non-finite===\nRelative clauses may be either finite clauses (as in the examples above) or [[non-finite clause]]s. An example of a non-finite relative clause in English is the [[infinitive clause]] ''on whom to rely'', in the sentence \"She is the person on whom to rely\".\n\n==Formation methods==\nLanguages differ in many ways in how relative clauses are expressed:\n#How the role of the shared noun phrase is indicated in the embedded clause.\n#How the two clauses are joined together.\n#Where the embedded clause is placed relative to the head noun (in the process indicating which noun phrase in the main clause is modified).\n\nFor example, the English sentence \"The man that I saw yesterday went home\" can be described as follows:\n#The role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated by ''gapping''; that is, a gap is left in the object position after \"saw\", implying that the shared noun phrase (\"the man\") is to be understood to fill that gap and to serve as the object of the verb \"saw\".\n#The clauses are joined by the ''complementizer'' \"that\".\n#The embedded clause is placed ''after'' the head noun \"the man\".\n\nThe following sentences indicate various possibilities (only some of which are grammatical in English):\n*\"The man [that I saw yesterday] went home\". (A ''complementizer'' linking the two clauses with a ''gapping'' strategy indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. One possibility in English. Very common cross-linguistically.)\n*\"The man [I saw yesterday] went home\". (Gapping strategy, with no word joining the clauses&mdash;also known as a [[reduced relative clause]]. One possibility in English. Used in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] when the head noun is [[definiteness|indefinite]], as in \"a man\" instead of \"the man\".)\n*\"The man [whom I saw yesterday] went home\". (A [[relative pronoun]] indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause\u2014in this case, the direct object. Used in formal English, as in [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] or [[Russian language|Russian]].)\n*\"The man [seen by me yesterday] went home\". (A [[reduced relative clause]], in this case [[passive voice|passivized]]. One possibility in English.)\n*\"The man [that I saw him yesterday] went home\". (A complementizer linking the two sentences with a [[resumptive pronoun]] indicating the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause, as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] or [[Persian language|Persian]].)\n*\"The man [that him I saw yesterday] went home\". (Similar to the previous, but with the resumptive pronoun fronted. This occurs in modern [[Greek language|Greek]] and as one possibility in modern [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]; the combination ''that him'' of complementizer and resumptive pronoun behaves similar to a unitary relative pronoun.)\n*\"The [I saw yesterday]'s man went home\". (Preceding relative clause with gapping and use of a possessive particle\u2014as normally used in a [[genitive construction]]\u2014to link the relative clause to the head noun. This occurs in many Sino-Tibetan languages and possibly developed from \"relative clause + noun\" > \"nominalized clause + noun\" > \"genitive construction\".<ref>http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_4_03_2641.pdf</ref><ref>http://www.ling.sinica.edu.tw/files/publication/j2008_4_05_5653.pdf</ref>)\n*\"The [I saw yesterday] man went home\". (Preceding relative clause with gapping and no linking word, as in [[Japanese language|Japanese]].)\n*\"The man [of my seeing yesterday] went home\". ([[Nominalization|Nominalized]] relative clause, as in [[Turkish language|Turkish]].)\n*\"[Which man I saw yesterday], that man went home\". (A ''correlative'' structure, as in [[Hindi]].)\n*\"[I saw the man yesterday] went home.\" (An ''unreduced, internally headed'' relative clause, as in [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] or [[Navajo language|Navajo]].)\n\n===Strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun in the relative clause===\nThere are four main strategies for indicating the role of the shared noun phrase in the embedded clause. These are typically listed in order of the degree to which the noun in the relative clause has been reduced, from most to least:\n\n# Gap strategy or gapped relative clause\n# Relative pronoun\n# Pronoun retention\n# Nonreduction\n\n====Gapped relative clause====\nIn this strategy, there is simply a gap in the relative clause where the shared noun would go. This is normal in English, for example, and also in Chinese and Japanese. This is the most common type of relative clause, especially in [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|verb-final]] languages with prenominal relative clauses, but is also widespread among languages with postnominal externally headed relative clauses.\n\nThere may or may not be any marker used to join the relative and main clauses. (Languages with a case-marked relative pronoun are technically not considered to employ the gapping strategy even though they do in fact have a gap, since the case of the relative pronoun indicates the role of the shared noun.) Often the form of the verb is different from that in main clauses and is to some degree nominalized, as in Turkish and in English [[reduced relative clause]]s.<ref>{{cite book | last=Carrol | first=David W | edition=5 | title=Psychology of Language | publisher=Thomson & Wadsworth | location=Belmont | year=2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | last=Townsend | first=David J |author2=Thomas G Bever  | title=Sentence Comprehension: The Integration of Habits and Rules | year=2001 | publisher=MIT Press | location=Cambridge | pages=247&ndash;9}}</ref>\n\nIn non-verb-final languages, apart from languages like [[Thai language|Thai]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] with very strong politeness distinctions in their grammars{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}, gapped relative clauses tend, however, to be restricted to positions high up in the accessibility hierarchy. With obliques and genitives, non-verb-final languages that do not have politeness restrictions on pronoun use tend to use pronoun retention. English is unusual in that ''all'' roles in the embedded clause can be indicated by gapping: e.g. \"I saw the man who is my friend\", but also (in progressively less accessible positions cross-linguistically, according to the ''[[accessibility hierarchy]]'' described below) \"...&nbsp;who I know\", \"...&nbsp;who I gave a book to\", \"...&nbsp;who I spoke with\", \"...&nbsp;who I run slower than\". Usually, languages with gapping disallow it beyond a certain level in the accessibility hierarchy, and switch to a different strategy at this point. [[Classical Arabic]], for example, only allows gapping in the subject and sometimes the direct object; beyond that, a resumptive pronoun must be used. Some languages have no allowed strategies at all past a certain point\u2014e.g. in many [[Austronesian languages]], such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], all relative clauses must have the shared noun serving the subject role in the embedded clause. In these languages, relative clauses with shared nouns serving \"disallowed\" roles can be expressed by [[passive voice|passivizing]] the embedded sentence, thereby moving the noun in the embedded sentence into the subject position. This, for example, would transform \"The man who I gave a book to\" into \"The man who was given a book by me\". Generally, languages such as this \"conspire\" to implement general relativization by allowing passivization from ''all'' positions \u2014 hence a sentence equivalent to \"The man who is run slower than by me\" is grammatical. Gapping is often used in conjunction with case-marked relative pronouns (since the relative pronoun indicates the case role in the embedded clause), but this is not necessary (e.g. Chinese and Japanese both using gapping in conjunction with an indeclinable complementizer).\n\n====Relative pronoun type====\nThis is in fact a type of gapped relative clause, but is distinguished by the fact that the role of the shared noun in the embedded clause is indicated indirectly by the case marking of the marker (the [[relative pronoun]]) used to join the main and embedded clauses. All languages which use relative pronouns have them in clause-initial position: though one could conceivably imagine a clause-final relative pronoun analogous to an adverbial subordinator in that position, they are unknown.\n\nSome languages have what are described as \"relative pronouns\" (in that they agree with some properties of the head noun, such as number and gender) but which do not actually indicate the case role of the shared noun in the embedded clause. [[Classical Arabic]] in fact has \"relative pronouns\" which are case-marked, but which agree in case with the ''head'' noun. Case-marked relative pronouns in the strict sense are almost entirely confined to [[Standard Average European|European languages]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}, where they are widespread except among the [[Celtic languages|Celtic family]] and [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan family]]. The influence of Spanish has led to their adaption by a very small number of [[indigenous languages of the Americas|Native American languages]], of which the best-known are the [[Keresan languages]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_aco|title=WALS Online - Language Acoma|author=|date=|website=wals.info|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n====Pronoun retention type====\nIn this type, the position relativized is indicated by means of a [[personal pronoun]] in the same syntactic position as would ordinarily be occupied by a noun phrase of that type in the main clause\u2014known as a ''[[resumptive pronoun]]''. It is equivalent to saying \"The man who I saw <u>him</u> yesterday went home\". Pronoun retention is very frequently used for relativization of inaccessible positions on the accessibility hierarchy. In [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Classical Arabic]], for example, resumptive pronouns are required when the embedded role is other than the subject or direct object, and optional in the case of the direct object. Resumptive pronouns are common in non-verb-final [[languages of Africa]] and Asia, and also used by the Celtic languages of northwest Europe and [[Romanian language|Romanian]] (\"Omul pe care <u>l</u>-am v\u0103zut ieri a mers acas\u0103\"/\"The man who I saw <u>him</u> yesterday went home\"). They also occur in deeply embedded positions in English, as in \"That's the girl that I don't know what <u>she</u> did\",<ref name=\"mckee\">{{citation|title=Resumptive Pronouns in English Relative Clauses|first1=Cecile|last1=McKee|first2=Dana|last2=McDaniel|journal=Language Acquisition|volume=9|number=2|year=2001|pages=113\u2013156|doi=10.1207/s15327817la0902_01}}.</ref> although this is sometimes considered non-standard.\n\nOnly a very small number of languages, of which the best known is [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], have pronoun retention as their sole grammatical type of relative clause.\n\n====Nonreduction type====\nIn the nonreduction type, unlike the other three, the shared noun occurs as a ''full-fledged noun phrase'' in the embedded clause, which has the form of a full independent clause. Typically, it is the head noun in the main clause that is reduced or missing. Some languages use relative clauses of this type with the normal strategy of embedding the relative clause next to the head noun. These languages are said to have ''internally headed'' relative clauses, which would be similar to the (ungrammatical) English structure \"[You see the girl over there] is my friend\" or \"I took [you see the girl over there] out on a date\". This is used, for example, in [[Navajo language|Navajo]], which uses a special relative verb (as with some other Native American languages).\n\nA second strategy is the ''correlative''-clause strategy used by [[Hindi]] and other [[Indo-Aryan languages]], as well as [[Bambara language|Bambara]]. This strategy is equivalent to saying \"Which girl you see over there, she is my daughter\" or \"Which knife I killed my friend with, the police found that knife\". It is \"correlative\" because of the corresponding \"which ... that ...\" demonstratives or \"which ... she/he/it ...\" pronouns, which indicate the respective nouns being equated. The shared noun can either be repeated entirely in the main clause or reduced to a pronoun. There is no need to front the shared noun in such a sentence. For example, in the second example above, Hindi would actually say something equivalent to \"I killed my friend with which knife, the police found that knife\".\n\nDialects of some European languages, such as Italian, do use the nonreduction type in forms that could be glossed in English as \"The man just passed us by, he introduced me to the chancellor here.\"\n\nIn general, however, nonreduction is restricted to verb-final languages, though it is more common among those that are [[head-marking language|head-marking]].\n\n===Strategies for joining the relative clause to the main clause===\nThe following are some of the common strategies for joining the two clauses:\n*Use of an indeclinable particle (specifically, a [[relativizer]]) inserted into the sentence, placed next to the modified noun; the embedded clause is likewise inserted into the appropriate position, typically placed on the other side of the complementizer. This strategy is very common and arguably occurs in English with the word ''that'' (\"the man that I saw\"), though this interpretation of \"that\" as something other than a relative pronoun is controversial (see [[#English|below]]). In the modern [[varieties of Arabic]] (using ''illi'' placed after the modified noun); in [[Chinese language|Chinese]] (using ''de'' placed before the modified noun).\n*Use of a [[relative pronoun]]. Prototypically, a relative pronoun agrees with the head noun in gender, number, definiteness, animacy, etc., but adopts the [[grammatical case|case]] that the shared noun assumes in the ''embedded'', not matrix, clause. This is the case in a number of conservative European languages, such as [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Many languages also have similar linking words commonly termed \"relative pronouns\" that agree in some way with the head noun, but do not adopt the case role of the embedded clause. In English, for example, the use of ''who'' vs. ''which'' agrees with the animacy of the head noun, but there is no case agreement except in the formal English contrast ''who'' vs. ''whom'' (which is often used incorrectly, if at all, in speech). Similarly, in [[Classical Arabic]], there is a relative pronoun that agrees in number, gender, [[definiteness]] ''and'' case with the head noun (rather than taking the case role of the noun in the embedded clause). Languages with prototypical relative pronouns typically use the gapping strategy for indicating the role in the embedded clause, since the relative pronoun itself indicates the role by its case. ([[Classical Arabic]], where the case marking indicates something else, uses a [[resumptive pronoun]].) Some linguists prefer to use the term ''relative pronoun'' only for the prototypical cases (but in this case it's unclear what to call the non-prototypical cases).\n*Directly inserting the embedded clause in the matrix clause at the appropriate position, with no word used to join them. This is common, for example, in English (cf. \"The man I saw yesterday went home\"), and is used in [[Classical Arabic]] in relative clauses that modify indefinite nouns.\n*By [[nominalization|nominalizing]] the relative clause (e.g. converting it to a participial construction). Generally, no relative pronoun or complementizer is used. This occurs, for example, in [[reduced relative clause]]s in English (e.g. \"The man seen by me yesterday went home\" or \"The man planning to go home soon is my friend\"). Formal German makes common use of such participial relative clauses, which can become extremely long. This is also the normal strategy in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], which has sentences equivalent to \"I ate the potato of Hasan's giving to Sina\" (in place of \"I ate the potato that Hasan gave to Sina\"). This can be viewed as a situation in which the \"complementizer\" is attached to the verb of the embedded clause (e.g. in English, \"-ing\" or \"-ed\" can be viewed as a type of complementizer).\n\n===Position of the head noun with respect to the relative clause===\nThe positioning of a relative clause before or after a head noun is related to the more general concept of [[Branching (linguistics)|branching]] in linguistics. Languages that place relative clauses after their head noun (so-called ''head-initial'' or ''VO'' languages) generally also have adjectives and [[genitive construction|genitive modifier]]s following the head noun, as well as verbs preceding their objects. [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] are prototypical languages of this sort. Languages that place relative clauses before their head noun (so-called ''head-final'' or ''OV'' languages) generally also have adjectives and [[genitive construction|genitive modifier]]s preceding the head noun, as well as verbs following their objects. [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]] are prototypical languages of this sort. Not all languages fit so easily into these categories. English, for example, is generally head-first, but has adjectives preceding their head nouns, and [[genitive construction]]s with both preceding and following modifiers (\"the friend of my father\" vs. \"my father's friend\"). [[Chinese language|Chinese]] has the ''VO'' order, with verb preceding object, but otherwise is generally head-final.\n\nVarious possibilities for ordering are:\n*Relative clause following the head noun, as in English, [[French language|French]] or [[Arabic language|Arabic]].\n*Relative clause preceding the head noun, as in [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], or [[Chinese language|Chinese]].\n*Head noun ''within'' the relative clause (an ''internally headed'' relative clause). An example of such a language is [[Navajo language|Navajo]]. These languages are said to have [[#Nonreduction type|nonreduced]] relative clauses. These languages have a structure equivalent to \"[I saw the man yesterday] went home\".\n*Adjoined relative clause. These languages have the relative clause completely outside the main clause, and use a correlative structure to link the two. These languages also have [[#Nonreduction type|nonreduced]] relative clauses. [[Hindi]] is the most well known such language, and have a structure similar to \"Which man I saw yesterday, that man went home\" or (with non-fronting of the relativized noun in the relative clause) \"I saw which man yesterday, that man went home\". Another example is [[Warlpiri language|Warlpiri]], which constructs relative clauses of a form similar to \"I saw the man yesterday, which he was going home\". However, it is sometimes said these languages have no relative clauses at all, since the sentences of this form can equally well translate as  \"I saw the man who was going home yesterday\" or \"I saw the man yesterday when/while he was going home\".\n\n==Accessibility hierarchy==\nThe antecedent of the relative clause (that is, the noun that is modified by it) can in theory be the subject of the main clause, or its object, or any other [[verb argument]]. In many languages, however, especially rigidly [[left-branching]], [[dependent-marking language]]s with prenominal relative clauses,<ref>Lehmann, Christian (1986). On the typology of relative clauses. ''Linguistics'', 24(4), 663-680. {{doi|10.1515/ling.1986.24.4.663}}</ref> there are major restrictions on the role the antecedent may have ''in the relative clause''.\n\n[[Edward Keenan]] and [[Bernard Comrie]] noted that these roles can be ranked cross-linguistically in the following order from most accessible to least accessible:<ref>Keenan, Edward L. & Comrie, Bernard (1977). Noun phrase accessibility and Universal Grammar, [[Linguistic Inquiry]], 8(1), 63-99</ref><ref>Comrie, Bernard; ''Language Universals and Linguistic Typology''; pp. 156-163; {{ISBN|0-226-11434-1}}</ref>\n\n:Subject  > Direct Object  > Indirect Object  > Oblique  > Genitive  > Object of comparative\n\n[[Ergative\u2013absolutive]] languages have a similar hierarchy:\n\n:[[Absolutive case|Absolutive]] > [[Ergative case|Ergative]] > Indirect Object > etc. (same as above)\n\nThis order is called the '''accessibility hierarchy'''. If a language can relativize positions lower in the accessibility hierarchy, it can always relativize positions higher up, but not vice versa. For example, [[Malagasy language|Malagasy]] can relativize only subject and [[Chukchi language|Chukchi]] only absolutive arguments, whilst [[Basque language|Basque]] can relativize absolutives, ergatives and indirect objects, but not obliques or genitives or objects of comparatives. Similar hierarchies have been proposed in other circumstances, e.g. for pronominal reflexes.\n\n[[English language|English]] can relativize all positions in the hierarchy. Here are some examples of the NP and relative clause usage from English:\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n!Position !! With explicit relative pronoun !! With omitted relative pronoun !! In formal English\n|-\n|[[subject (grammar)|Subject]] || That's the man [who ran away]. || \u2014 || That's the man [who ran away].\n|-\n|[[Direct object]] || That's the man [who I saw yesterday]. || That's the man [I saw yesterday]. || That's the man [whom I saw yesterday].\n|-\n|[[Indirect object]] || That's the man [who I gave the letter to]. || That's the man [I gave the letter to]. || That's the man [to whom I gave the letter]. \n|-\n|[[oblique case|Oblique]] || That's the man [who I was talking about].  || That's the man [I was talking about]. || That's the man [about whom I was talking]. \n|-\n|[[Genitive]] || That's the man [whose sister I know].\t       || \u2014 ||  That's the man [whose sister I know].\n|-\n|Obj of Comp || That's the man [who I am taller than].\t\t       || That's the man [I am taller than]. || That's the man [than whom I am taller].\n|}\n\nSome other examples:\n\n{| align=\"center\"\n!Position !! Example\n|-\n|[[subject (grammar)|Subject]] || The girl [who came late] is my sister.\n|-\n|[[Direct object]]  || I gave a rose to the girl [that Kate saw].\n|-\n|[[Indirect object]] || John knows the girl [I wrote a letter to].\n|-\n|[[oblique case|Oblique]] || I found the rock [which the robbers had hit John over the head with].\n|-\n|[[Genitive]] || The girl [whose father died] told me she was sad.\n|-\n|Obj of Comp || The first person [I can't run faster than] will win a million dollars.\n|}\n\nLanguages that cannot relativize directly on noun phrases low in the accessibility hierarchy can sometimes use alternative [[grammatical voice|voices]] to \"raise\" the relevant noun phrase so that it can be relativized. The most common example is the use of [[applicative voice]]s to relativize obliques, but in such languages as Chukchi [[antipassive voice|antipassives]] are used to raise ergative arguments to absolutive.\n\nFor example, a language that can relativize only subjects could say this:\n*The girl [who likes me] came to visit.\nBut not:\n*The girl [whom I like] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I gave a rose to] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I watched a movie with] came to visit.\n*The girl [whose father I know] came to visit.\n*The girl [whom I know the father of] came to visit. (''equivalent to previous'')\n*The girl [whom I am taller than] came to visit.\nThese languages might form an equivalent sentence by [[passive voice|passivization]]:\n*The girl [who was liked by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was given a rose by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was watched a movie with by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was known the father of by me] came to visit.\n*The girl [who was been taller than by me] came to visit.\nThese passivized sentences get progressively more ungrammatical in English as they move down the accessibility hierarchy; the last two, in particular, are so ungrammatical as to be almost unparsable by English speakers. But languages with severe restrictions on which roles can be relativized are precisely those that can passivize almost any position, and hence the last two sentences would be normal in those languages.\n\nA further example is languages that can relativize only subjects and direct objects. Hence the following would be possible:\n*The girl [who I like] came to visit.\nThe other ungrammatical examples above would still be ungrammatical. These languages often allow an oblique object to be moved to the direct object slot by the use of the so-called ''[[applicative voice]]'', much as the [[passive voice]] moves an oblique object to the subject position. The above examples expressed in an applicative voice might be similar to the following (in not necessarily grammatical English):\n*The girl [who I gave a rose] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I with-watched a movie] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I (of-)know the father] came to visit.\n*The girl [who I out-tall] came to visit.\n\nModern grammars may use the accessibility hierarchy to order productions\u2014e.g. in [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]] the hierarchy corresponds to the order of elements on the ''subcat'' list, and interacts with other principles in explanations of binding facts. The hierarchy also figures in\n[[Lexical Functional Grammar]], where it is known as Syntactic Rank or the Relational Hierarchy.\n\n==Examples==\n\n===Indo-European languages===\n\n====English====\n{{main|English relative clauses}}\nIn English, a relative clause follows the noun it modifies. It is generally indicated by a relative pronoun at the start of the clause, although sometimes simply by word order. If the relative pronoun is the object of the verb in the relative clause, it comes at the beginning of the clause even though it would come at the end of an independent clause (\"He is the man ''whom'' I saw\", not \"He is the man I saw ''whom''\").\n\nThe choice of relative pronoun can be affected by whether the clause modifies a human or non-human noun, by whether the clause is restrictive or not,<ref>{{cite book |last=Kordi\u0107 |first=Snje\u017eana |authorlink=Snje\u017eana Kordi\u0107 |editor1-last=Suprun |editor1-first=Adam E |url-status=live |editor2-last=Jachnow |editor2-first=Helmut |title=Slavjano-germanskie jazykovye paralleli/Slawisch-germanische Sprachparallelen |series=Sovmestnyj issledovatel'skij sbornik slavistov universitetov v Minske i Bochume |publisher=Belorusskij gosudarstvennyj universitet |page=165 |language=German |chapter=Pronomina im Antezedenten und Restriktivit\u00e4t/Nicht-Restriktivit\u00e4t von Relativs\u00e4tzen im Kroatoserbischen und Deutschen |trans-chapter=Pronouns in antecedents and restrictive / non-restrictive relative clauses in Serbo-Croatian and German |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/426662.PRONOMINA_IM_ANTEZEDENT.PDF |location=Minsk |year=1996 |oclc=637166830 |ssrn=3434472 |id={{CROSBI|426662}} |archivedate=29 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6AHPw0DET |accessdate=14 July 2019}}</ref> and by the role (subject, direct object, or the like) of the relative pronoun in the relative clause.\n\n*For a human antecedent, \"who\", \"whom\", or \"that\" is usually used (\"He is the person ''who'' saw me\", \"He is the person ''whom'' I saw\", \"He is the person ''that'' I saw\"). For a non-human antecedent, only \"that\" or \"which\" is used.\n*For a non-human antecedent in a non-restrictive clause, only \"which\" is used (\"The tree, ''which'' fell, is over there\"); while either \"which\" or \"that\" may be used in a restrictive clause (\"The tree ''which'' fell is over there\", \"The tree ''that'' fell is over there\"){{mdash}}but some styles and prescriptive grammars require the use of \"that\" in the restrictive context.\n*Of the relative pronoun pair \"who\" and \"whom\", the ''subjective'' case form (\"who\") is used if it is the subject of the relative clause (\"He is the policeman who saw me\"); and, in formal usage, the ''objective'' case form (\"whom\") if it is the object of the verb or preposition in the relative clause (\"He is the policeman whom I saw\", \"He is the policeman whom I talked to\", \"He is the policeman to whom I talked\"); but in informal usage \"whom\" is often replaced by \"who\".\n\nIn English, as in some other languages (such as French; see below), [[restrictiveness|non-restrictive]] relative clauses are set off with commas, but restrictive ones are not:\n\n*\"I met a man and a woman yesterday. The woman, ''who had a thick French accent'', was very pretty.\" (non-restrictive\u2014does not narrow down who is being talked about)\n*\"I met two women yesterday, one with a thick French accent and one with a mild Italian one. The woman ''who had the thick French accent'' was very pretty.\" (restrictive\u2014adds information about who is being referred to)\n\nThe status of \"that\" as a relative pronoun is not universally agreed. Traditional grammars treat \"that\" as a relative pronoun, but not all contemporary grammars do: e.g. the [[Cambridge Grammar of the English Language]] (pp.&nbsp;1056\u20137) makes a case for treating \"that\" as a subordinator instead of a relative pronoun; and the [[British National Corpus]] treats \"that\" as a subordinating conjunction even when it introduces relative clauses. One motivation for the different treatment of \"that\" is that there are differences between \"that\" and \"which\" (e.g., one can say \"in which\" but not \"in that\", etc.).\n\n====French====\nThe system of relative pronouns in [[French language|French]] is as complicated as, but similar in many ways to, the system in English.\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the direct object of the relative clause, ''{{lang|fr|que}}'' is generally used, although ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'', which is inflected for grammatical gender and number, is sometimes used in order to give more precision. For example, any of the following is correct and would translate to \"I talked to his/her father and mother, whom I already knew\":\n\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''laquelle''' (f. sing.) je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''lesquels''' (m. pl.) je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec son p\u00e8re et sa m\u00e8re, '''que''' je connaissais d\u00e9j\u00e0.}}''\n\nHowever, in the first sentence, \"whom I already knew\" refers only to the mother; in the second, it refers to both parents; and in the third, as in the English sentence, it could refer either only to the mother, or to both parents.\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the subject of the relative clause, ''{{lang|fr|qui}}'' is generally used, though as before, ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' may be used instead for greater precision. (This is less common than the use of ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' with direct objects, however, since verbs in French often reflect the grammatical number of their subjects.)\n\nContrary to English, the relative pronoun can never be omitted in French, not even when the relative clause is embedded in another relative clause.\n:Here is what I think '''\u00d8''' happened.\n:''{{lang|fr|Voil\u00e0 ce que je crois '''qui''' est arriv\u00e9.}}'' (literally: \"Here is what I think '''that''' happened.\")\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act in a possessive sense, where the preposition ''de'' (of/from) would normally be used, the pronoun ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' (\"whose\") is used, but does not act as a [[determiner (linguistics)|determiner]] for the noun \"possessed\":\n\n:''{{lang|fr|J'ai parl\u00e9 avec une femme '''dont''' le fils est mon coll\u00e8gue.}}'' (\"I spoke with a woman whose son I work with.\" - ''lit.'', \"I spoke with a woman ''of whom'' the son is my colleague.\")\n\nThis construction is also used in non-possessive cases where the pronoun replaces an object marked by ''{{lang|fr|de}}'':\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est l'homme '''dont''' j'ai parl\u00e9.}}'' (\"That's the man '''of whom''' I spoke.\")\n\nMore generally, in modern French, ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' can signal the topic of the following clause, without replacing anything in this clause:\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est un homme '''dont''' je crois qu'il doit tr\u00e8s bien gagner sa vie.}}'' (\"That's a man '''about whom''' I believe that he must make a lot of money.\")\n\nWhen the pronoun is to act as the object of a preposition (other than when ''{{lang|fr|dont}}'' is used), ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' is generally used, though ''{{lang|fr|qui}}'' can be used if the antecedent is human.\n\n:''{{lang|fr|Ce sont des gens '''sur lesquels''' on peut compter.}}'' (\"These are people '''that''' can be depended '''on'''.\") [literally: \"'''on whom''' one can depend\"]\n:''{{lang|fr|Ce sont des gens '''sur qui''' on peut compter.}}''\n\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est une table '''sur laquelle''' on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.}}'' (\"This is a table '''on which''' you can put a lot of things\")\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki>''C'est une table sur qui on peut mettre beaucoup de choses.''\n\nThere exists a further complication when the antecedent is a non-human indefinite pronoun. In that case, ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' cannot be used because it must agree in gender with its head, and an indefinite pronoun has no gender. Instead, ''{{lang|fr|quoi}}'', which usually means \"what\", is used.\n:''{{lang|fr|C'est manifestement <u>quelque chose</u> '''\u00e0 quoi''' il a beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi.}}'' (\"This is obviously <u>something</u> '''that '''he has thought a lot '''about '''.\")\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki>''C'est manifestement quelque chose \u00e0 laquelle il a beaucoup r\u00e9fl\u00e9chi.''\n\nThe same happens when the antecedent is an entire clause, also lacking gender.\n:''{{lang|fr|Il m'a dit d'aller me faire voir, '''\u00e0 quoi''' j'ai r\u00e9pondu que...}}'' (\"He told me to get lost, '''to which''' I replied that ...\")\n\nThe preposition always appears before the pronoun, and the prepositions ''{{lang|fr|de}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|\u00e0}}'' (at/to) contract with ''{{lang|fr|lequel}}'' to form ''{{lang|fr|duquel}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|auquel}}'', or with ''{{lang|fr|lesquel(le)s}}'' to form ''{{lang|fr|desquel(le)s}}'' and ''{{lang|fr|auxquel(le)s}}''.\n\n====German====\n[[File:Intonation of German restrictive relative clauses.jpg|thumb|350px|right|[[Intonation (linguistics)|Intonation]] of [[German language|German]] [[#Restrictive and non-restrictive|restrictive relative clauses]]]]Aside from their highly inflected forms, [[German language|German]] relative pronouns are less complicated than English. There are two varieties. The more common one is based on the definite article ''der'', ''die'', ''das'', but with distinctive forms in the genitive (''dessen'', ''deren'') and in the dative plural (''denen''). Historically this is related to English ''that''. The second, which is more literary and used for emphasis, is the relative use of ''welcher'', ''welche'', ''welches'', comparable with English ''which''. As in most Germanic languages, including Old English, both of these varieties inflect according to gender, case and number. They take their gender and number from the noun which they modify, but the case from their function in their own clause.\n\n:''Das Haus, in dem ich wohne, ist sehr alt.''\n::The house in which I live is very old.\n\nThe relative pronoun ''dem'' is neuter singular to agree with ''Haus'', but dative because it follows a preposition in its own clause. On the same basis, it would be possible to substitute the pronoun ''welchem''.\n\nHowever, German uses the uninflecting ''was'' ('what') as a relative pronoun when the antecedent is ''alles'', ''etwas'' or ''nichts'' ('everything', 'something', 'nothing'.).\n\n:''Alles, was Jack macht, gelingt ihm.''\n::Everything that Jack does is a success.\n\nIn German, all relative clauses are marked with commas.\n\nAlternatively, particularly in formal registers, participles (both active and passive) can be used to embed relative clauses in adjectival phrases:\n\n:''Die von ihm in jenem Stil gemalten Bilder sind sehr begehrt''\n::The pictures he painted in that style are highly sought after\n:''Die Regierung m\u00f6chte diese im letzten Jahr eher langsam wachsende Industrie weiter f\u00f6rdern''\n::The government would like to further promote this industry, which has grown rather slowly over the last year\n\nUnlike English, which only permits relatively small participle phrases in adjectival positions (typically just the participle and adverbs), and disallows the use of direct objects for active participles, German sentences of this sort can embed clauses of arbitrary complexity.\n\n====Spanish====\nSee [[Spanish pronouns#Relative pronouns|Relative pronouns]] in the Spanish pronouns article.\n\n====Latin====\nIn [[Latin]], relative clauses follow the noun phrases they modify, and are always introduced using relative pronouns. Relative pronouns, like other pronouns in Latin, agree with their antecedents in [[grammatical gender|gender]] and [[grammatical number|number]], but not in [[grammatical case|case]]: a relative pronoun's case reflects its role in the relative clause it introduces, while its antecedent's case reflects the antecedent's role in the clause that contains the relative clause. (Nonetheless, it is possible for the pronoun and antecedent to be in the same case.) For example:\n\n:'''''Urb\u0113s''', '''quae''' sunt magnae, videntur. (''The '''cities''', '''which''' are large, are being seen.'')\n:'''''Urb\u0113s''', '''qu\u0101s''' v\u012bd\u012b, erant magnae.'' (''The '''cities''', '''which''' I saw, were large.'')\n\nIn the former example, ''urb\u0113s'' and ''quae'' both function as [[subject (grammar)|subjects]] in their respective clauses, so both are in the nominative case; and due to gender and [[number agreement]], both are feminine and plural. In the latter example, both are still feminine and plural, and ''urb\u0113s'' is still in the nominative case, but ''quae'' has been replaced by ''qu\u0101s'', its accusative-case counterpart, to reflect its role as the [[direct object]] of ''v\u012bd\u012b''.\n\nFor more information on the forms of Latin relative pronouns, ''see'' [[Latin declension#Relative pronouns|the section on relative pronouns in the article on Latin declension]].\n\n====Ancient Greek====\n[[Ancient Greek]] follows the same rule as Latin.\n\n*\u03b1\u1f31 \u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b5\u03b9\u03c2, \u1f03\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f36\u03b4\u03bf\u03bd, \u03bc\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9 \u03b5\u1f30\u03c3\u03af\u03bd.\n:hai p\u00f3leis, h\u00e0s e\u00eedon, meg\u00e1lai eisin.\n:The cities that I saw are large.\n\nThe Ancient Greek relative pronoun \u1f45\u03c2, \u1f25, \u1f45 (''h\u00f3s, h\u0113&#769;, h\u00f3'') is unrelated to the Latin word, since it derives from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] {{PIE|*yos}}: in [[Proto-Greek language|Proto-Greek]], ''y'' before a vowel usually changed to ''h'' ([[debuccalization]]). [[Cognate]]s include [[Sanskrit]] relative pronouns ''yas, y\u0101, yad'' (where ''o'' changed to short ''a'').<ref>{{LSJ|o(/s1|\u1f45\u03c2|ref}}</ref>\n\nThe Greek definite article \u1f41, \u1f21, \u03c4\u03cc (''ho, h\u0113, t\u00f3'') has a different origin, since it is related to the Sanskrit demonstrative ''sa, s\u0101'' and [[Latin]] ''is-tud''.<ref>{{LSJ|o(1|\u1f41|shortref}}</ref>\n\nInformation that in English would be encoded with relative clauses could be represented with complex participles in Ancient Greek.

A direct relative clause is used where the relativized element is the subject or the direct object of its clause (e.g. \"the man ''who'' saw me\", \"the man ''whom'' I saw\"), while an indirect relative clause is used where the relativized element is a genitival (e.g. \"the man ''whose'' daughter is in the hospital\") or is the object of a preposition (e.g. \"the man ''to whom'' I gave the book\"). Direct relative clauses are formed with a [[relative pronoun]] (unmarked for case) at the beginning; a gap (in terms of syntactic theory, a [[trace (linguistics)|trace]], indicated by (''t)'' in the examples below) is left in the relative clause at the pronoun's expected position.\n\n;Irish\n{|\n| an || fear || a || chonaic || (''t)'' || m\u00e9\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL || saw || || me\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"the man who saw me\"\n|}\n;Welsh\n{|\n| y || dyn || a || welais\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL || I saw\n|-\n| colspan=4 | \"the man whom I saw\"\n|}\n\nThe direct relative particle \"a\" is not used with \"mae\" (\"is\") in Welsh; instead the form \"sydd\" or \"sy'\" is used:\n\n{|\n| y || dyn || sy'n || blewog || iawn\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL + is || hairy || very \n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"the man who is very hairy\"\n|}\n\nThere is also a defective verb \"piau\" (usually lenited to \"biau\"), corresponding to \"who own(s)\":\n\n{|\n| y || dyn || piau || castell || anferth\n|-\n| the || man || DIR-REL + owns || castle || huge \n|-\n| colspan=5 | \"the man who owns a huge castle\"\n|}\n\nIndirect relative clauses are formed with a [[relativizer]] at the beginning; the relativized element remains ''in situ'' in the relative clause.\n\n;Irish\n{|\n| an || fear || a || bhfuil || a || in\u00edon || san || ospid\u00e9al\n|-\n| the || man || IND-REL || is || his || daughter || in the || hospital\n|-\n| colspan=8 | \"the man whose daughter is in the hospital\"\n|}\n;Welsh\n{|\n| y || dyn || y || rhois || y || llyfr || iddo\n|-\n| the || man || IND-REL || I gave || the || book || to him\n|-\n| colspan=7 | \"the man to whom I gave the book\"\n|}\n\nAlthough both the Irish relative pronoun and the relativizer are 'a', the relative pronoun triggers lenition of a following consonant, while the relativizer triggers eclipsis (see [[Irish initial mutations]]).\n\nBoth direct and indirect relative particles can be used simply for emphasis, often in answer to a question or as a way of disagreeing with a statement. For instance, the Welsh example above, \"y dyn a welais\" means not only \"the man whom I saw\", but also \"it was the man (and not anyone else) I saw\"; and \"y dyn y rhois y llyfr iddo\" can likewise mean \"it was the man (and not anyone else) to whom I gave the book\".\n\n===Semitic languages===\n\n====Hebrew====\nIn [[Biblical Hebrew language|Biblical Hebrew]], relative clauses were headed with the word ''asher'', which could be either a [[relative pronoun]] or a [[relativizer]]. In later times, ''asher'' became interchangeable with the prefix ''she-'' (which is also used as a conjunction, with the sense of English ''that''), and in [[Modern Hebrew language|Modern Hebrew]], this use of ''she-'' is much more common than ''asher'', except in some formal, archaic, or poetic writing. In meaning, the two are interchangeable; they are used regardless of whether the clause is modifying a human, regardless of their grammatical case in the relative clause, and regardless of whether the clause is restrictive.\n\nFurther, because Hebrew does not generally use its word for ''is'', ''she-'' is used to distinguish adjective phrases used in epithet from adjective phrases used in attribution:\n\n:''Ha-kise l'-yad-kha.'' (\"The chair is next to you.\" - ''lit.'', \"The-chair [is] to-hand-your.\")\n:''Ha-kise '''she-'''l'-yad-kha shavur.'' (\"The chair next to you is broken.\"\u2014''lit.'', \"The-chair '''that'''-[is]-to-hand-your [is] broken.\")\n\n(This use of ''she-'' does not occur with simple adjectives, as Hebrew has a different way of making that distinction. For example, ''Ha-kise adom'' means \"The chair [is] red,\" while ''Ha-kis'e ha-adom shavur'' means \"The red chair is broken\"\u2014literally, \"The chair the red [is] broken.\")\n\nSince 1994, the official rules of Modern Hebrew (as determined by the [[Academy of the Hebrew Language]]) have stated that relative clauses are to be punctuated in Hebrew the same way as in English (described above). That is, non-restrictive clauses are to be set off with commas, while restrictive clauses are not:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev alav, shavur.'' (\"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting on, is broken.\")\n:''Ha-kise '''she-'''ata yoshev alav shavur.'' (\"The chair '''that''' you are sitting on is broken.\")\n\nNonetheless, many, perhaps most, speakers of Modern Hebrew still use the pre-1994 rules, which were based on the German rules (described above). Except for the simple adjective-phrase clauses described above, these speakers set off all relative clauses, restrictive or not, with commas:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev alav, shavur.'' (\"The chair '''that''' you are sitting on is broken,\" ''or'' \"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting on, is broken.\")\n\nOne major difference between relative clauses in Hebrew and those in (for example) English is that in Hebrew, what might be called the \"regular\" pronoun is not always suppressed in the relative clause. To reuse the prior example:\n\n:''Ha-kise, '''she-'''ata yoshev '''alav''', shavur.'' (''lit.'', \"The chair, '''which''' you are sitting '''on it''', [is] broken.\")\n\nMore specifically, if this pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, it is always suppressed. If it is the direct object, then it is usually suppressed, though it is also correct to leave it in. (If it is suppressed, then the special preposition ''et'', used to mark the direct object, is suppressed as well.) If it is the object of a preposition, it must be left in, because in Hebrew\u2014unlike in English\u2014a preposition cannot appear without its object. When the pronoun is left in, ''she-'' might more properly be called a [[relativizer]] than a relative pronoun.\n\nThe [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[relativizer]] ''she-'' \u2018that\u2019 \"might be a shortened form of the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] [[relativizer]] ''\u2018asher'' \u2018that\u2019, which is related to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''\u2018ashru'' \u2018place\u2019 (cf. Semitic *''\u2018athar'') Alternatively, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] ''\u2018asher'' derived from ''she-'', or it was a convergence of Proto-Semitic ''dhu'' (cf. Aramaic ''d\u012b'') and ''\u2018asher'' [...] Whereas [[Israeli Hebrew|Israeli]] ''she-'' functions both as [[complementizer]] and [[relativizer]], ''ash\u00e9r'' can only function as a [[relativizer]].\"<ref>A quote from p. 79 of [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] (2006), \"Complement Clause Types in Israeli\", ''Complementation: A Cross-Linguistic Typology'', edited by [[R.

Aikhenvald]], [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 72-92 (Chapter 3).</ref>\n\n====Arabic====\n\n=====Literary Arabic=====\nIn [[Modern Standard Arabic|Modern Standard]] and [[Classical Arabic]] there is a relative pronoun (in Arabic: {{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0627\u0633\u0645 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0648\u0635\u0648\u0644}} {{transl|ar|DIN|''al-ism al-maw\u1e63\u016bl''}}) ''alla\u1e0f\u012b'' (masculine singular), feminine singular ''allat\u012b'', masculine plural ''alla\u1e0f\u012bna'', feminine plural ''allaw\u0101t\u012b'', masculine dual ''alla\u1e0f\u0101n\u012b'' (nominative) / ''alla\u1e0fayni'' (accusative and genitive), feminine dual ''allat\u0101n\u012b'' (nom.) / ''allatayn\u012b'' (acc. and gen.).\n\nIts usage has two specific rules: it agrees with the antecedent in gender, number and case, and it is used only if the antecedent is definite. If the antecedent is indefinite, no relative pronoun is used. The former is called ''jumlat sila'' (conjunctive sentence) while the latter is called ''jumlat sifa'' (descriptive sentence).\n\n*{{lang|ar|\u0627\u0644\u0648\u0644\u062f \u0627\u0644\u0630\u064a \u0631\u0623\u064a\u062a\u0647 \u0641\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0635\u0641 \u0623\u0645\u0633 \u063a\u0627\u0626\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u064a\u0648\u0645 }}\n:''al-waladu (a)lladhi ra\u2019aytuhu f\u012b (a)\u1e63-\u1e63affi \u2019amsi \u0121\u0101\u2019ibun al-yawma''\n:\"The boy I saw in class yesterday is missing today\".

(relative pronoun absent)\n\n=====Colloquial Arabic=====\nIn Colloquial Arabic the multiple forms of the relative pronoun have been levelled in favour of a single form, a simple conjunction, which in most dialects is ''illi'', and is never omitted. So in Palestinian Arabic the above sentences would be:\n\n* ''alwalad illi shuft\u014d fi (a)ssaff emb\u0101rih gh\u0101yeb aly\u014dm''\n* ''h\u0101da walad illi shuft\u014d fi (a)ssaff emb\u0101rih''\n\nAs in Hebrew, the regular pronoun referring to the antecedent is repeated in the relative clause - literally, \"the boy whom I saw '''him''' in class...\" (the ''-hu'' in ''ra'aituhu'' and the ''-\u014d'' in ''shuft\u014d''). The rules of suppression in Arabic are identical to those of Hebrew: obligatory suppression in the case that the pronoun is the subject of the relative clause, obligatory retention in the case that the pronoun is the object of a preposition, and at the discretion of the speaker if the pronoun is the direct object. The only difference from Hebrew is that, in the case of the direct object, it is preferable to retain the pronoun rather than suppress it.\n\n===Japonic languages===\n\n====Japanese====\nJapanese does not employ relative pronouns to relate relative clauses to their antecedents. Instead, the relative clause directly modifies the noun phrase as an [[attributive verb]], occupying the same syntactic space as an attributive adjective (before the noun phrase).\n\n:\u3053\u306e\u3000\u304a\u3044\u3057\u3044\u3000\u5929\u3077\u3089\n:''kono oishii tempura''\n:\"this delicious [[tempura]]\"\n\n:\u59c9\u304c\u3000\u4f5c\u3063\u305f\u3000\u5929\u3077\u3089\n:''ane-ga tsukutta tempura''\n:''sister-SUBJ make-PAST tempura''\n:\"the tempura [that] my sister made\"\n\n:\u5929\u3077\u3089\u3092\u3000\u98df\u3079\u305f\u3000\u4eba\n:''tempura-o tabeta hito''\n:''tempura-OBJ eat-PAST person''\n:\"the person who ate the tempura\"\n\nIn fact, since so-called ''i-adjectives'' in Japanese are technically intransitive stative verbs, it can be argued that the structure of the first example (with an adjective) is the same as the others.

In (1a) below, ''lalaki'' 'man' serves as the head, while ''nagbigay ng bigas sa bata'' 'gave rice to the child' is the relative clause.\n\n:{|\n| (1) || a. || '''lalaki''' || =ng || nagbigay || ____ || ng || bigas || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  || man || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave ||  || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=8 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || Nagbigay || ''ang'' || ''lalaki'' || ng || bigas || sa || bata.\n|-\n|  ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=8 | \"The man gave rice to the child.\"\n|}\n\nThe gap inside the relative clause corresponds to the position that the noun acting as the head would have normally taken, had it been in a [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|declarative sentence]]. In (1a), the gap is in subject position within the relative clause. This corresponds to the subject position occupied by ''ang lalaki'' 'the man' in the declarative sentence in (1b).\n\nThere is a constraint in Tagalog on the position from which a noun can be relativised and in which a gap can appear: A noun has to be the subject within the relative clause in order for it to be relativised. The phrases in (2) are ungrammatical because the nouns that have been relativised are not the subjects of their respective relative clauses. In (2a), the gap is in direct object position, while in (2b), the gap is in indirect object position.\n\n:{|\n| (2) || a. || * || '''bigas''' || na || nagbigay || ang || lalaki || ____ || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || rice || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man ||  || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || colspan=8 | for:  \"rice that the man gave to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || * || '''bata''' || =ng || nagbigay || ang || lalaki || ng || bigas || ____\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || child || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|nom}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice ||\n|-\n|  ||  ||  || colspan=8 | for:  \"child that the man gave rice to\"\n|}\n\nThe correct Tagalog translations for the intended meanings in (2) are found in (3), where the verbs have been passivised in order to raise the logical direct object in (3a) and the logical indirect object in (3b) to subject position.  (Tagalog can have more than one [[Tagalog grammar#Trigger .28voice .2F focus.29|passive voice]] form for any given verb.)\n\n:{|\n| (3) || a. || '''bigas''' || na || ibinigay || ng || lalaki || sa || bata\n|-\n|  ||  || rice || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|psv}}.gave || {{sc|gen}} || man || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"rice that the man gave to the child\"\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | (or:  \"rice that was given to the child by the man\")\n|-\n|  || b. || '''bata''' || =ng || binigyan || ng || lalaki || ng || bigas\n|-\n|  ||  || child || {{sc|comp}} || gave.{{sc|psv}} || {{sc|gen}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"child that the man gave rice to\"\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | (or:  \"child that was given rice to by the man\")\n|}\n\nTagalog relative clauses can be left-headed, as in (1a) and (3), right-headed, as in (4), or internally headed, as in (5).\n\n:{|\n| (4) || nagbigay || ng || bigas || sa || bata || na || '''lalaki'''\n|-\n|   || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child || {{sc|comp}} || man\n|-\n|  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|}\n\n:{|\n| (5) || a. || nagbigay || na || '''lalaki''' || ng || bigas || sa || bata\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|comp}} || man || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || nagbigay || ng || bigas || na || '''lalaki''' || sa || bata\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|act}}.gave || {{sc|acc}} || rice || {{sc|comp}} || man || {{sc|dat}} || child\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"man that gave rice to the child\"\n|}\n\nIn (4), the head, ''lalaki'' 'man', is found after or to the right of the relative clause, ''nagbigay ng bigas sa bata'' 'gave rice to the child'. In (5), the head is found in some position inside the relative clause. When the head appears to the right of or internally to the relative clause, the complementiser appears to the left of the head. When the head surfaces to the left of the relative clause, the complementiser surfaces to the right of the head.\n\nThere are exceptions to the subjects-only constraint to relativisation mentioned above. The first involves relativising the [[Possession (linguistics)|possessor]] of a noun phrase within the relative clause.\n\n:{|\n| (6) || '''bata''' || =ng || nasugatan || ang || daliri || ____\n|-\n|   || child || {{sc|comp}} || injured.{{sc|psv}} || {{sc|nom}} || finger ||\n|-\n|  || colspan=6 | \"child whose finger was injured\"\n|}\n\nIn (6), the head, ''bata'' 'child', is the owner of the injured finger. The phrase ''ang daliri'' 'the finger' is the subject of the verb, ''nasugatan'' 'was injured'.\n\nAnother exception involves relativising the [[Oblique case|oblique]] noun phrase.\n\n:{|\n| (7) || a. || '''ospital''' || (na) || kung || saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || hospital || {{sc|comp}} || {{sc|q-comp}} || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"hospital where Juan was born\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || b. || Nagtanong || siya || kung || saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan.\n|-\n|  ||  || {{sc|act}}.asked || {{sc|3sg.nom}} || {{sc|q-comp}} || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"She asked where Juan was born.\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || c. || Ipinanganak || si || Juan || ''sa'' || ''ospital''.\n|-\n|   ||  || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan || {{sc|loc}} || hospital\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"Juan was born at the hospital.\"\n|-\n|-\n|  || d. || Saan || ipinanganak || si || Juan?\n|-\n|   ||  || where || {{sc|psv}}.bore || {{sc|nom}} || Juan\n|-\n|  ||  || colspan=7 | \"Where was Juan born?\"\n|}\n\nWhen an oblique noun phrase is relativised, as in (7a), ''na'' 'that', the complementiser that separates the head from the relative clause, is optional. The relative clause itself is also composed differently. In the examples in (1a), and in (3) to (6), the relative clauses are simple declaratives that contain a gap. However, the relative clause in (7a) looks more like an [[Indirect speech|indirect]] [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|question]], complete with the [[Sentence (linguistics)#By purpose|interrogative]] complementiser, ''kung'' 'if', and a pre-verbally positioned [[Interrogative word|WH-word]] like ''saan'' 'where', as in (7b). The sentence in (7c) is the declarative version of the relative clause in (7a), illustrating where the head, ''ospital'' 'hospital', would have been \"before\" relativisation. The question in (7d) shows the direct question version of the [[Dependent clause|subordinate]] indirect question in (7b).\n\n====Hawaiian====\n\nRelative clauses in [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]<ref>Alexander, W. D., ''Introduction to Hawaiian Grammar'', Dover, 2004 (originally 1864): 45-47.</ref>  are avoided unless they are short.\n\nIf in English a relative clause would have a copula and an adjective, in Hawaiian the antecedent is simply modified by the adjective: \"The honest man\" instead of \"the man who is honest\". If the English relative clause would have a copula and a noun, in Hawaiian an appositive is used instead: \"Paul, an apostle\" instead of \"Paul, who was an apostle\".\n\nIf the English relative pronoun would be the subject of an intransitive or passive verb, in Hawaiian a participle is used instead of a full relative clause:  \"the people fallen\" instead of \"the people who fell\"; \"the thing given\" instead of \"the thing that was given\". But when the relative clause's antecedent is a person, the English relative pronoun would be the subject of the relative clause, and the relative clause's verb is active and transitive, a relative clause is used and it begins with the relative pronoun ''nana'': ''The one who me (past) sent'' = \"the one who sent me\".\n\nIf in English a relative pronoun would be the object of a relative clause, in Hawaiian the possessive form is used so as to treat the antecedent as something possessed: ''the things of me to have seen'' = \"the things that I saw\"; ''Here is theirs to have seen'' = This is what they saw\".\n\n===Andean languages===\n\n====Aymara====\n{|\n| thuqu\u00f1ap || punchu\n|-\n| dance-INF-3POSS || poncho\n|-\n| colspan=6 | \"the poncho he is dancing with\"\n|}\n\n===Chinese===\n\n====Mandarin====\n{{further|Chinese grammar}}\nIn [[Mandarin Chinese]], the relative clause is similar to other adjectival phrases in that it precedes the noun that it modifies, and ends with the relative particle ''de''. If the relative clause is missing a subject but contains an object (in other words, if the verb is transitive), the main-clause noun is the implied subject of the relative clause:<ref>The examples in this section are from Li, Charles N., and Thompson, Sandra A., ''Mandarin Chinese: A Functional Reference Grammar'', Univ. of California Press, 1981: 579-585.</ref>\n\n:{{Zh|c={{linktext|\u79cd|\u6c34\u679c|\u7684|\u519c\u4eba}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}} (\u7a2e\u6c34\u679c\u7684\u8fb2\u4eba\u3002)\n:{{Zh|s=|t=|p=zh\u00f2ng shu\u01d0gu\u01d2 de n\u00f3ngr\u00e9n|labels=no}}\n: grow fruit (particle) farmer\n: \"the fruit-growing farmer\" or \"the farmer who grows fruit\"\n\nIf the object but not the subject is missing from the relative clause, the main-clause noun is the implied object of the relative clause:\n\n:{{Zh|c={{linktext|\u4ed6\u4eec|\u79cd|\u7684|\u6c34\u679c}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}} (\u4ed6\u5011\u7a2e\u7684\u6c34\u679c\u3002)\n:{{Zh|s=|t=|p=t\u0101men zh\u00f2ng de shu\u01d0gu\u01d2|labels=no|c=}}\n: they grow (particle) fruit\n: \"the by-them-grown fruit\" or \"the fruit that they grow\"\n\nIf both the subject and the object are missing from the relative clause, then the main-clause noun could either be the implied subject or the implied object of the relative clause; sometimes which is intended is clear from the context, especially when the subject or object of the verb must be human and the other must be non-human:\n\n:{{Zh|c={{linktext|(\u7528)\u4eca\u5929|\u8d62|\u7684|\u94b1|\u4f86|\u4ed8|\u623f\u79df}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}}((\u7528)\u4eca\u5929\u8d0f\u7684\u9322\u4f86\u4ed8\u623f\u79df\u3002)\n:{{Zh|s=|t=|p=j\u012bnti\u0101n y\u00edng de qi\u00e1n f\u00f9 f\u00e1ng z\u016b|labels=no|c=}}\n: today win (particle) money pay house rent\n: \"the won-today money pays the rent\" or \"the money that was won today pays the rent\"\n\nBut sometimes ambiguity arises when it is not clear from the context whether the main-clause noun is intended as the subject or the object of the relative clause:\n\n:{{Zh|c={{linktext|\u6628\u5929|\u6279\u8bc4|\u7684|\u4eba|\u90fd|\u4e0d\u5728|\u8fd9\u91cc}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}}(\u6628\u5929\u6279\u8a55\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u4e0d\u5728\u9019\u88e1\u3002)\n:{{Zh|s=|t=|p=zu\u00f3ti\u0101n p\u012bping de r\u00e9n d\u014du bu z\u00e0i zh\u00e8l\u01d0|labels=no|c=}}\n:yesterday criticize (particle) person all not at here\n:\"the people who criticized [others] yesterday are all not here\" or \"the people whom [others] criticized yesterday are all not here\"\n\nHowever, the first meaning (in which the main-clause noun is the subject) is usually intended, as the second can be unambiguously stated using a passive voice marker:\n\n:{{Zh|c={{linktext|\u6628\u5929|\u88ab|\u6279\u8bc4|\u7684|\u4eba|\u90fd\u4e0d|\u5728|\u8fd9\u91cc}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}} (\u6628\u5929\u88ab\u6279\u8a55\u7684\u4eba\u90fd\u4e0d\u5728\u9019\u88e1\u3002)\n:{{Zh|s=|t=|p=zu\u00f3ti\u0101n b\u00e8i p\u012bping de r\u00e9n d\u014du bu z\u00e0i zh\u00e8l\u01d0|labels=no|c=}}\n:yesterday (passive marker) criticize (particle) person all not at here\n:\"the people who were criticized yesterday are all not here\"\n\nSometimes a relative clause has both a subject and an object specified, in which case the main-clause noun is the implied object of an implied preposition in the relative clause:\n\n:{{Zh|c={{linktext|\u6211|\u5199|\u4fe1|\u7684|\u6bdb\u7b14}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}}(\u6211\u5beb\u4fe1\u7684\u6bdb\u7b46\u3002)\n:{{Zh|s=|t=|p=w\u01d2 xi\u011b x\u00ecn de m\u00e1ob\u01d0|labels=no|c=}}\n:I write letter (particle) brushpen\n:the brushpen that I write letters with\n\nIt is also possible to include the preposition explicitly in the relative clause, but in that case it takes a pronoun object (a [[personal pronoun]] with the function of a relative pronoun):<ref>This example is from Chaofen Sun, ''Chinese: A Linguistic Introduction'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, p. 189.</ref>\n:{{Zh|c={{linktext|\u6211|\u66ff|\u4ed6|\u753b|\u7684|\u4eba}}|s=|t=|p=|labels=no}}(\u6211\u66ff\u4ed6\u756b\u7684\u4eba\u3002)\n:{{Zh|s=|t=|p=w\u01d2 t\u00ec t\u0101 hu\u00e0 hu\u00e0 de r\u00e9n|labels=no|c=}}\n:I for him/her draw picture (particle) person\n:\"the person for whom I drew the picture\"\n\nFree relative clauses are formed in the same way, omitting the modified noun after the particle ''de''. As with bound relative clauses, ambiguity may arise; for example, {{Zh|c={{linktext|\u5403\u7684}}|s=|t=|p=ch\u012b de|labels=no}} \"eat (particle)\" may mean \"that which is eaten\", i.e. \"food\", or \"those who eat\".<ref>Sun (2006), p. 187.</ref>\n\n===Creoles===\n\n====Hawaiian Creole English====\n\nIn [[Hawaiian Creole English]], an English-based [[creole language|creole]] also called Hawaiian Pidgin or simply Pidgin, relative clauses work in a way that is similar to, but not identical to, the way they work in English.<ref>Sakoda, Kent, and Siegel, Jeff. ''Pidgin Grammar'', Bess Press, 2003: pp. 102ff.</ref> As in English, a relative pronoun that serves as the object of the verb in the relative clause can optionally be omitted: For example,\n\n:''Ai neva si da buk daet Lisa wen bai''\n:I never see the book that Lisa (past) buy\n:I didn't see the book that Lisa bought\n\ncan also be expressed with the relative pronoun omitted, as\n\n:''Ai neva si da buk Lisa wen bai''\n:I never see the book Lisa (past) buy\n:I didn't see the book Lisa bought\n\nHowever, relative pronouns serving as the subject of a relative clause show more flexibility than in English; they can be included, as is mandatory in English, they can be omitted, or they can be replaced by another pronoun. For example, all of the following can occur and all mean the same thing:\n\n:''Get wan nada grl hu no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl who no can stay still\n:There's another girl who cannot stay still\n\n:''Get wan nada grl no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl no can stay still\n\n:''Get wan nada grl shi no kaen ste stil''\n:There's one other girl she no can stay still\n\n====Gullah====\n\nIn [[Gullah language|Gullah]], an English-based creole spoken along the southeastern coast of the United States, no relative pronoun is normally used for the subject of a relative clause. For example:\n\n:''Duh him cry out so''\n:It him cry out so\n:It's he who cries out so\n\n:''Enty duh dem shum dey?''\n:Ain't it them saw_him there?\n:Isn't it they who saw him there?\n\n==See also==\n*[[Long-distance dependencies]]\n*[[Reduced relative clause]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n*[[Rodney Huddleston]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum|Geoffrey K.

Depending on jurisdiction and university, these may be either undergraduate-entry (most of Europe, Asia, South America and Oceania), or [[Graduate Entry Program|graduate-entry programs]] (mainly Australia, Philippines and North America). Some jurisdictions and universities provide both undergraduate entry programs and graduate entry programs (Australia, South Korea).\n\nIn general, initial training is taken at [[medical school]]. Traditionally initial medical education is divided between ''preclinical'' and ''clinical'' studies. The former consists of the basic sciences such as [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[pathology]]. The latter consists of teaching in the various areas of clinical medicine such as [[internal medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[psychiatry]], [[general practice]] and [[surgery]].\n\nThere has been a proliferation of programmes that combine medical training with research (M.D./Ph.D.) or management programmes (M.D./ MBA), although this has been criticised because extended interruption to clinical study has been shown to have a detrimental effect on ultimate clinical knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dyrbye LN|author2=Thomas MR|author3=Natt N|author4=Rohren CH|title=Prolonged Delays for Research Training in Medical School are Associated with Poorer Subsequent Clinical Knowledge|journal=J Gen Intern Med|date=2007|pmid=17492473|doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0200-x|volume=22|pages=1101\u20136|issue=8|pmc=2305740}}</ref>\n\n==Postgraduate education==\n\nFollowing completion of entry-level training, newly graduated doctors are often required to undertake a period of supervised practice before full registration is granted; this is most often of one-year duration and may be referred to as an \"internship\" or \"provisional registration\" or \"[[Residency (medicine)|residency]]\".\n\n[[File:D\u011bkan\u00e1t 1.LF UK.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Dean's office at the [[First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague|First Faculty of Medicine]], [[Charles University]], [[Prague]]]]\n\nFurther training in a particular field of medicine may be undertaken. In the U.S., further specialized training, completed after residency is referred to as \"fellowship\".  In some jurisdictions, this is commenced immediately following completion of entry-level training, while other jurisdictions require junior doctors to undertake generalist (unstreamed) training for a number of years before commencing specialisation.\n\nEducation theory itself is becoming an integral part of postgraduate medical training. Formal qualifications in education are also becoming the norm for medical educators, such that there has been a rapid increase in the number of available graduate programs in medical education.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tekian|first1=A|last2=Artino|first2=AR|title=AM last page: master's degree in health professions education programs.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=September 2013|volume=88|issue=9|pages=1399|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e31829decf6|pmid=23982511}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tekian|first1=A|last2=Artino|first2=AR|title=AM last page.

Among some institutions and for some students, it may be 6 years (including the selection of an intercalated BSc\u2014taking one year\u2014at some point after the pre-clinical studies).  All programs culminate in the [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] degree (abbreviated MBChB, MBBS, MBBCh, BM, etc.). This is followed by 2 clinical foundation years afterward, namely F1 and F2, similar to internship training. Students register with the UK [[General Medical Council]] at the end of F1. At the end of F2, they may pursue further years of study. The system in Australia is very similar, with registration by the Australian Medical Council (AMC).\n\nIn the US and Canada, a potential medical student must first complete an undergraduate degree in any subject before applying to a graduate medical school to pursue an ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) program.  U.S. medical schools are almost all four-year programs.  Some students opt for the research-focused M.D./Ph.D. dual degree program, which is usually completed in 7\u201310 years. There are certain courses that are pre-requisite for being accepted to medical school, such as general [[chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]], [[English language|English]], labwork, etc. The specific requirements vary by school.\n\nIn Australia, there are two pathways to a medical degree. Students can choose to take a five- or six-year undergraduate medical degree [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS or BMed) as a first tertiary degree directly after secondary school graduation, or first complete a bachelor's degree (in general three years, usually in the medical sciences) and then apply for a four-year [[Graduate Medical Program|graduate entry]] [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) program.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/pathways/medicine/#registration|title=Medicine - Find My Pathway|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surgeons.org/becoming-a-surgeon/surgery-as-a-career/pathways-through-specialty-medical-training/|title=Pathways through specialty medical training|last=(RACS)|first=Royal Australasian College of Surgeons|website=www.surgeons.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>\n\nSee:{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* North America\n**[[Medical school in Canada|Medical education in Canada]]\n**[[Medical education in Panama]]\n**[[Medical education in Mexico]]\n**[[Medical education in the United States]]\n* Europe\n**[[Medical education in France]]\n**[[Medical education in Norway]]\n**[[Medical education in the United Kingdom]]\n{{col-2}}\n* Asia/Middle East/Oceania\n**[[Medical education in Australia]]\n**[[Medical education in china|Medical education in China]]\n**[[Medical education in Hong Kong]]\n**[[Medical College (India)|Medical education in India]]\n**[[Medical education in Jordan]]\n**[[Medical education in the Philippines]]\n* Africa\n**[[Medical education in South Africa]]\n**[[Medical education in Uganda]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Integration with [[health policy]] ==\nAs medical professional stakeholders in the field of health care (i.e. entities integrally involved in the health care system and affected by reform), the practice of medicine (i.e. diagnosing, treating, and monitoring disease) is directly affected by the ongoing changes in both national and local health policy and economics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Michael L.|title=Introduction: Health Policy and Health Care Economics Observed|journal=Seminars in Radiation Oncology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=149\u2013151|doi=10.1016/j.semradonc.2008.01.001|pmid=18513623|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nThere is a growing call for health professional training programs to not only adopt more rigorous health policy education and leadership training,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=R.

Depending on jurisdiction and university, these may be either undergraduate-entry (most of Europe, Asia, South America and Oceania), or [[Graduate Entry Program|graduate-entry programs]] (mainly Australia, Philippines and North America). Some jurisdictions and universities provide both undergraduate entry programs and graduate entry programs (Australia, South Korea).\n\nIn general, initial training is taken at [[medical school]]. Traditionally initial medical education is divided between ''preclinical'' and ''clinical'' studies. The former consists of the basic sciences such as [[anatomy]], [[physiology]], [[biochemistry]], [[pharmacology]], [[pathology]]. The latter consists of teaching in the various areas of clinical medicine such as [[internal medicine]], [[pediatrics]], [[obstetrics and gynecology]], [[psychiatry]], [[general practice]] and [[surgery]].\n\nThere has been a proliferation of programmes that combine medical training with research (M.D./Ph.D.) or management programmes (M.D./ MBA), although this has been criticised because extended interruption to clinical study has been shown to have a detrimental effect on ultimate clinical knowledge.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Dyrbye LN|author2=Thomas MR|author3=Natt N|author4=Rohren CH|title=Prolonged Delays for Research Training in Medical School are Associated with Poorer Subsequent Clinical Knowledge|journal=J Gen Intern Med|date=2007|pmid=17492473|doi=10.1007/s11606-007-0200-x|volume=22|pages=1101\u20136|issue=8|pmc=2305740}}</ref>\n\n==Postgraduate education==\n\nFollowing completion of entry-level training, newly graduated doctors are often required to undertake a period of supervised practice before full registration is granted; this is most often of one-year duration and may be referred to as an \"internship\" or \"provisional registration\" or \"[[Residency (medicine)|residency]]\".\n\n[[File:D\u011bkan\u00e1t 1.LF UK.jpg|thumb|right|290px|Dean's office at the [[First Faculty of Medicine, Charles University in Prague|First Faculty of Medicine]], [[Charles University]], [[Prague]]]]\n\nFurther training in a particular field of medicine may be undertaken. In the U.S., further specialized training, completed after residency is referred to as \"fellowship\".  In some jurisdictions, this is commenced immediately following completion of entry-level training, while other jurisdictions require junior doctors to undertake generalist (unstreamed) training for a number of years before commencing specialisation.\n\nEducation theory itself is becoming an integral part of postgraduate medical training. Formal qualifications in education are also becoming the norm for medical educators, such that there has been a rapid increase in the number of available graduate programs in medical education.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tekian|first1=A|last2=Artino|first2=AR|title=AM last page: master's degree in health professions education programs.|journal=Academic Medicine|date=September 2013|volume=88|issue=9|pages=1399|doi=10.1097/ACM.0b013e31829decf6|pmid=23982511}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Tekian|first1=A|last2=Artino|first2=AR|title=AM last page.

Among some institutions and for some students, it may be 6 years (including the selection of an intercalated BSc\u2014taking one year\u2014at some point after the pre-clinical studies).  All programs culminate in the [[Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery]] degree (abbreviated MBChB, MBBS, MBBCh, BM, etc.). This is followed by 2 clinical foundation years afterward, namely F1 and F2, similar to internship training. Students register with the UK [[General Medical Council]] at the end of F1. At the end of F2, they may pursue further years of study. The system in Australia is very similar, with registration by the Australian Medical Council (AMC).\n\nIn the US and Canada, a potential medical student must first complete an undergraduate degree in any subject before applying to a graduate medical school to pursue an ([[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] or [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine|D.O.]]) program.  U.S. medical schools are almost all four-year programs.  Some students opt for the research-focused M.D./Ph.D. dual degree program, which is usually completed in 7\u201310 years. There are certain courses that are pre-requisite for being accepted to medical school, such as general [[chemistry]], [[organic chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]], [[English language|English]], labwork, etc. The specific requirements vary by school.\n\nIn Australia, there are two pathways to a medical degree. Students can choose to take a five- or six-year undergraduate medical degree [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS or BMed) as a first tertiary degree directly after secondary school graduation, or first complete a bachelor's degree (in general three years, usually in the medical sciences) and then apply for a four-year [[Graduate Medical Program|graduate entry]] [[Bachelor of Medicine/Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS) program.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.findmypathway.com/pathways/medicine/#registration|title=Medicine - Find My Pathway|work=Find My Pathway|access-date=2018-10-26|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.surgeons.org/becoming-a-surgeon/surgery-as-a-career/pathways-through-specialty-medical-training/|title=Pathways through specialty medical training|last=(RACS)|first=Royal Australasian College of Surgeons|website=www.surgeons.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}</ref>\n\nSee:{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* North America\n**[[Medical school in Canada|Medical education in Canada]]\n**[[Medical education in Panama]]\n**[[Medical education in Mexico]]\n**[[Medical education in the United States]]\n* Europe\n**[[Medical education in France]]\n**[[Medical education in Norway]]\n**[[Medical education in the United Kingdom]]\n{{col-2}}\n* Asia/Middle East/Oceania\n**[[Medical education in Australia]]\n**[[Medical education in china|Medical education in China]]\n**[[Medical education in Hong Kong]]\n**[[Medical College (India)|Medical education in India]]\n**[[Medical education in Jordan]]\n**[[Medical education in the Philippines]]\n* Africa\n**[[Medical education in South Africa]]\n**[[Medical education in Uganda]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n== Integration with [[health policy]] ==\nAs medical professional stakeholders in the field of health care (i.e. entities integrally involved in the health care system and affected by reform), the practice of medicine (i.e. diagnosing, treating, and monitoring disease) is directly affected by the ongoing changes in both national and local health policy and economics.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Steinberg|first=Michael L.|title=Introduction: Health Policy and Health Care Economics Observed|journal=Seminars in Radiation Oncology|volume=18|issue=3|pages=149\u2013151|doi=10.1016/j.semradonc.2008.01.001|pmid=18513623|year=2008}}</ref>\n\nThere is a growing call for health professional training programs to not only adopt more rigorous health policy education and leadership training,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=R.

Despite these limitations, several programs in both medical school and residency training have been pioneered.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref name=\":4\" /><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Catalanotti|first=Jillian|last2=Popiel|first2=David|last3=Johansson|first3=Patrik|last4=Talib|first4=Zohray|date=2014-01-07|title=A Pilot Curriculum to Integrate Community Health Into Internal Medicine Residency Training|journal=Journal of Graduate Medical Education|language=EN|volume=5|issue=4|pages=674\u2013677|doi=10.4300/jgme-d-12-00354.1|pmid=24455022|pmc=3886472}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/09/481206602/this-med-school-teaches-health-policy-along-with-the-pills|title=This Med School Teaches Health Policy Along With The Pills.|last=Rovner|first=Julie|date=June 9, 2016|work=|access-date=December 13, 2016|via=NPR and Kaiser Health News (KHN)}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Shah SH, Clark MD, Hu K, Shoener JA, Fogel J, Kling WC, Ronayne J | year = 2017 | title = Systems-Based Training in Graduate Medical Education for Service Learning in the State Legislature in the United States: Pilot Study | url = https://mededu.jmir.org/2017/2/e18/ | journal = JMIR Med Educ | volume = 3 | issue = 2| page = e18 | doi = 10.2196/mededu.7730 | pmid = 29042343 | pmc = 5663953 }}</ref>\n\nLastly, more national support and research will be needed to not only establish these programs but to evaluate how to both standardize and innovate the curriculum in a way that is flexible with the changing health care and policy landscape.

Still the director Ranjan Chandel and Writer Hanzalah Shahid are talents to watch out for. For one, in this era of stereotype-ridden, Islamophobic Bollywood rants, it is nice to see a film in which the protagonist is a Muslim, but is not given any stereotypical markers of the religion, and members of the community are treated as regular humans: some good, some not, some evil, some not\". She also mentioned, \"Besides, how can one not make note of artists who can conceptualise a scene in which a love-lorn youth gazing at the object of his affection tells her that pimples look good on her face?

The striking introduction melds realism, humour and an earthy song. She mentioned, \"The second half of ''Bamfaad'' does not live up to the promise of the pre-interval portion. Still the director Ranjan Chandel and Writer Hanzalah Shahid are talents to watch out for. For one, in this era of stereotype-ridden, Islamophobic Bollywood rants, it is nice to see a film in which the protagonist is a Muslim, but is not given any stereotypical markers of the religion, and members of the community are treated as regular humans: some good, some not, some evil, some not\". She also mentioned, \"Besides, how can one not make note of artists who can conceptualise a scene in which a love-lorn youth gazing at the object of his affection tells her that pimples look good on her face? He does not say \u201ceven pimples\u201d, he simply says \u201cpimples\u201d. Oh the sweet innocence of those words!

The documentary originally aired on the [[PBS]] network and it also aired in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Two|BBC2]].  Created and executive produced by [[Henry Hampton]] at the film production company Blackside and narrated by [[Julian Bond]], the series uses [[archival footage]], stills and interviews by participants and opponents of the movement.  The title of the series is derived from the title of the [[folk song]] \"[[Keep Your Eyes on the Prize]],\" which is used as the opening theme music in each episode.\n\nA total of 14 episodes of ''Eyes on the Prize'' were produced in two separate parts.  The first part, ''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years 1954\u20131965'', chronicles the time period between the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) to the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] of 1965.  It consists of six episodes, which premiered on January 21, 1987 and concluded on February 25, 1987.  The second part, ''Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965\u20131985'', chronicles the time period between the national emergence of [[Malcolm X]] during 1964 to the 1983 election of [[Harold Washington]] as the first African-American mayor of [[Chicago]].  It consists of eight episodes, which aired on January 15, 1990 and ended on March 5, 1990, and was made widely available to educators on VHS tape. All 14 hours were re-released on DVD in 2006 by PBS.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe film originated as two sequential projects. Part one, six hours long, was shown on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in early 1987 as ''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years 1954\u20131965''. Eight more hours were broadcast in 1990 as ''Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965\u20131985''.\n\nIn 1992, the documentary was released on home video.  By the mid-1990s, both rebroadcasts and home video distribution were halted for several years due to expiration of rights and licenses of copyrighted archive footage, photographs and music used in the series and increasingly higher rates imposed by the copyright holders.<ref>[http://www.harborproductions.com/print_files/IDAeyes6-05.pdf Sheila Curran Bernard, \"Eyes on the Rights - The Rising Cost of Putting History on Screen\"], ''Documentary Online Magazine,'' June 05 Issue, International Documentary Association.

The documentary originally aired on the [[PBS]] network and it also aired in the United Kingdom on [[BBC Two|BBC2]].  Created and executive produced by [[Henry Hampton]] at the film production company Blackside and narrated by [[Julian Bond]], the series uses [[archival footage]], stills and interviews by participants and opponents of the movement.  The title of the series is derived from the title of the [[folk song]] \"[[Keep Your Eyes on the Prize]],\" which is used as the opening theme music in each episode.\n\nA total of 14 episodes of ''Eyes on the Prize'' were produced in two separate parts.  The first part, ''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years 1954\u20131965'', chronicles the time period between the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' (1954) to the [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] of 1965.  It consists of six episodes, which premiered on January 21, 1987 and concluded on February 25, 1987.  The second part, ''Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965\u20131985'', chronicles the time period between the national emergence of [[Malcolm X]] during 1964 to the 1983 election of [[Harold Washington]] as the first African-American mayor of [[Chicago]].  It consists of eight episodes, which aired on January 15, 1990 and ended on March 5, 1990, and was made widely available to educators on VHS tape. All 14 hours were re-released on DVD in 2006 by PBS.\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe film originated as two sequential projects. Part one, six hours long, was shown on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] in early 1987 as ''Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Years 1954\u20131965''. Eight more hours were broadcast in 1990 as ''Eyes on the Prize II: America at the Racial Crossroads 1965\u20131985''.\n\nIn 1992, the documentary was released on home video.  By the mid-1990s, both rebroadcasts and home video distribution were halted for several years due to expiration of rights and licenses of copyrighted archive footage, photographs and music used in the series and increasingly higher rates imposed by the copyright holders.<ref>[http://www.harborproductions.com/print_files/IDAeyes6-05.pdf Sheila Curran Bernard, \"Eyes on the Rights - The Rising Cost of Putting History on Screen\"], ''Documentary Online Magazine,'' June 05 Issue, International Documentary Association.
