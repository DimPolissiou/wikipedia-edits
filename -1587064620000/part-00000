The Man started the relationship with the label by lying that the songs for the sixth studio album were ready. As the band had a more \"generous\" timeline than in the past, they went to [[Seattle]] to work on some songs, and came out with only one. Then they joined producer [[John Hill (record producer)|John Hill]] in a studio in [[El Paso]], where they managed to write one song, \"Floating (Time Isn't Working My Side)\". The band members noticed that for the first time they weren't able to communicate,<ref name=\"Oregon Live\"/><ref name=\"Paste background\"/> and decided they needed some space to regroup.<ref name=\"Paste background\"/> Hill and singer/songwriter John Gourley went to [[New York City|New York]], while other members of the band returned to [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]. Gourley would call them to say what he needed, and they would record and e-mail, however, the distance complicated communication even further. In a midway of the creative process, Gourley said to Hill during an argument that he was going to quit the band and \"go back to Alaska and build houses.\"<ref name=\"Oregon Live\"/>\n\nIn an interview with MTV News, Gourley said that the band \"wrote the album, did pre-production and then everything fell apart.\" The band would go into the studio, \"mess everything up,\" leave the studio to go on tour, and then try again.<ref name=\"MTV background\">{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1667498/portugal-the-man-new-album-mountain-cloud/ |title=Portugal.

The Man posted these samples for streaming via [[SoundCloud]].\n\nOn June 6, 2011, Portugal. The Man released a short film entitled \"Sleep Forever\" via [[Independent Film Channel|IFC]]. The film acted as an extended music video for the songs \"Sleep Forever\" and \"Got It All (This Can't Be Living Now)\". The film depicted frontman John Baldwin Gourley on a dog-sled, riding through the Alaskan wilderness. At one point, the dogs go missing and John runs off to look for them. He trips in the snow and his gun discharges and kills him. While lying in the snow, one of his missing dogs starts to eat John while he sings \"Got It All\". During that song, the scene switches from the dog eating John and him singing in an igloo behind a fire. Then, the camera sets on a mountain side with three strange lights and ends. A bit of the footage was originally shown in the 30-second previews for \"Once Was One\", \"All Your Light (Times Like These)\", \"So American\" and \"You Carried Us (Share With Me The Sun)\".\n\nAt one point, before the album was released, you could purchase Portugal.

The convoy departed [[Loch Ewe]], [[Scotland]] on 2 September 1942, rendezvoused with more ships and escorts at Iceland and arrived at Arkhangelsk on 21 September. An exceptionally large number of escorts was provided by the [[Royal Navy]] in Operation EV, including the first escort carrier to accompany an Arctic convoy. Detailed information on German intentions was provided by the code breakers at [[Bletchley Park]] and elsewhere, through [[Ultra]] signals decrypts and eavesdropping on ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' wireless communications.\n\nThe German ''[[B-Dienst]]'' read some British signals and ''Luftwaffe'' used the lull in convoys after [[Convoy PQ 17]] (27 June \u2013 10 July) to prepare a maximum effort with the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. From 12 to 21 September PQ 18 was attacked by bombers, torpedo-bombers, U-boats and mines, which sank thirteen ships at a cost of  forty-four aircraft and four U-boats. The convoy was defended by escort ships and the aircraft of the escort carrier {{HMS|Avenger|D14|6}} which used signals intelligence gleaned from Ultra and ''Luftwaffe'' wireless frequencies to provide early warning of some air attacks and to attempt evasive routeing of the convoy around concentrations of U-boats. [[United States Navy Armed Guard]] and British [[Defensively equipped merchant ship|Naval]] and [[Royal Artillery]] Maritime Regiment gunners were embarked on the freighters to operate anti-aircraft guns and barrage balloons, which made air attacks more difficult and because of inexperience, occasionally wounded men and damaged ships and cargo, with wild shooting.\n\nThe convoy handed over its distant escorts and ''Avenger'' to the homeward bound [[Convoy QP 14]] near Archangelsk on 16 September and continued with the close escort and local escorts, riding out a storm in the Northern Dvina estuary and the last attacks by the ''Luftwaffe'', before reaching Archangelsk on 21 September. Several ships ran aground in the storm but all were eventually refloated; unloading the convoy took a month. Because of its losses and the transfer in November of its most effective remaining aircraft to the Mediterranean to oppose [[Operation Torch]], the ''Luftwaffe'' effort could never be repeated.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Arctic convoys===\n\n{{main|Arctic convoys of World War II|Home Fleet}}\n\nIn October 1941, after [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the [[USSR]], which had begun on 22 June, the Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]], made a commitment to send a convoy to the Arctic ports of the USSR every ten days and to deliver {{nowrap|1,200 tanks}} a month from July 1942 to January 1943, followed by {{nowrap|2,000 tanks}} and another {{nowrap|3,600 aircraft}} more than already promised.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=22}}{{efn|In October 1941, the unloading capacity of Archangel was {{convert|300000|LT|t|0|abbr=on}}, Vladivostok {{convert|140000|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|60000|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} in the Persian Gulf ports.{{sfn|Howard|1972|p=44}}}} The first convoy was due at Murmansk around 12 October and the next convoy was to depart Iceland on 22 October. A motley of British, Allied and neutral shipping loaded with military stores and raw materials for the Soviet war effort would be assembled at Hvalfjordur, Iceland, convenient for ships from both sides of the Atlantic.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=14}} By late 1941, the convoy system used in the Atlantic had been established on the Arctic run; a [[convoy commodore]] ensured that the ships' masters and signals officers attended a briefing before sailing to make arrangements for the management of the convoy, which sailed in a formation of long rows of short columns. The commodore was usually a retired naval officer, aboard a ship identified by a white pendant with a blue cross. The commodore was assisted by a Naval signals party of four men, who used lamps, semaphore flags and telescopes to pass signals, coded from books carried in a bag, weighted to be dumped overboard. In large convoys, the commodore was assisted by vice- and rear-commodores who directed the speed, course and zig-zagging of the merchant ships and liaised with the escort commander.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=22\u201323}}{{efn|By the end of 1941, 187 [[Matilda II]] and 249 [[Valentine tank]]s had been delivered, comprising 25 percent of the medium-heavy tanks in the Red Army, making 30\u201340 percent of the medium-heavy tanks defending Moscow. In December 1941, 16 perent of the fighters defending Moscow were [[Hawker Hurricane]]s and [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss Tomahawks]] from Britain and by 1 January 1942, 96 Hurricane fighters were flying in the [[Soviet Air Forces]] (''Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily'', VVS). The British supplied radar apparatus, machine tools, [[Asdic]] and commodities.{{sfn|Edgerton|2011|p=75}}}}\n\nFollowing [[Convoy PQ 16]] and the disaster to [[Convoy PQ 17]] in July 1942, Arctic convoys were postponed for nine weeks and much of the Home Fleet was detached to the Mediterranean for [[Operation Pedestal]], a [[Malta]] convoy. During the lull, Admiral [[John Tovey, 1st Baron Tovey|John Tovey]] concluded that the Home Fleet had been of no great protection to convoys beyond Bear Island, midway between [[Spitsbergen]] and the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]]. Tovey would oversee the operation from [[Scapa Flow]], where the fleet was linked to the Admiralty by landline, immune to variations in wireless reception. The next convoy should be accompanied by sufficient protection against surface attack; the longer-range destroyers of the Home Fleet could be used to augment the close escort force of anti-submarine and anti-aircraft ships, to confront a sortie by German ships with the threat of a massed destroyer torpedo attack. The practice of meeting homeward-bound QP convoys near Bear Island was dispensed with and QP 14 was to wait until PQ 18 was near its destination, despite the longer journey being more demanding of crews, fuel and equipment. The new [[escort carrier]] {{HMS|Avenger|D14|6}} (Commander A. P. Colthurst) had arrived from the [[United States]] and was added to the escort force, to give the convoy air cover.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|pp=278\u2013281}}\n\n===Signals intelligence===\n\n====Bletchley Park====\n\n{{main|Ultra}}\n\nThe British [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS) based at [[Bletchley Park]] housed a small industry of code-breakers and [[Traffic analysis|traffic analysts]]. By June 1941, the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] machine Home Waters (''Heimish'') settings used by surface ships and U-boats could quickly be read. On 1 February 1942, the Enigma machines used in U-boats in the Atlantic and Mediterranean were changed but German ships and the U-boats in Arctic waters continued with the older ''Heimish'' (''Hyrda'' from 1942, Dolphin to the British). By mid-1941, British [[Y-stations]] were able to receive and read ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[Wireless telegraphy|W/T]] transmissions and give advance warning of ''Luftwaffe'' operations. In 1941, naval Headache personnel with receivers to eavesdrop on ''Luftwaffe'' wireless transmissions were embarked on warships and from May 1942, ships gained RAF Y ''computor'' parties, which sailed with cruiser admirals in command of convoy escorts, to interpret ''Luftwaffe'' W/T signals intercepted by the Headaches. The Admiralty sent details of ''Luftwaffe'' wireless frequencies, call signs and the daily local codes to the computors, which combined with their knowledge of ''Luftwaffe'' procedures, could glean fairly accurate details of German reconnaissance sorties. Sometimes computors predicted attacks twenty minutes before they were detected by radar.{{sfn|Macksey|2004|pp=141\u2013142}}{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=141, 145\u2013146}}\n\n====B-Dienst====\n\n{{main|B-Dienst}}\n\nThe rival German [[B-Dienst|''Beobachtungsdienst'']] (''B-Dienst'', Observation Service) of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' [[German Naval Intelligence Service|''Marinenachrichtendienst'']] (''MND'', Naval Intelligence Service) had broken several Admiralty codes and cyphers by 1939, which were used to help ''Kriegsmarine'' ships elude British forces and provide opportunities for surprise attacks. From June to August 1940, six British submarines were sunk in the Skaggerak using information gleaned from British wireless signals.

(The RAF donated the remaining Hampdens and Spitfires to the [[Soviet Air Forces|Soviet Air Force]] (Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily, VVS); the crews returned to Britain on the cruiser {{HMS|Argonaut|61|6}} and two destroyers on 28 October).{{sfn|Roskill|1962|pp=284, 287\u2013288}}\n\n===14 September===\n\n[[File:HMS Avenger.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Ammunition ship SS ''Mary Luckenbach'' explodes while carrying {{convert|1000|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} of TNT, seen from the deck of the escort carrier HMS ''Avenger''}}]]\nAt {{nowrap|3:30 a.m.}} on 14 September, the oiler {{SS|Atheltemplar||2}} was torpedoed by {{GS|U-457||2}} which was being stalked by an escort, the U-boat then dived under the convoy and escaped, cloaked from Asdic by propeller noise. Fires on ''Atheltemplar'' were impossible to extinguish and it was abandoned, to be sunk by the escorts after the survivors were rescued. Swordfish patrols began at dawn and at {{nowrap|9:40 a.m.}} a U-boat about {{convert|6|nmi|mi+km|abbr=on}} starboard of the convoy was spotted and marked by a smoke float before a Ju 88 shadower saw off the Swordfish. ''U-589'' surfaced again and was seen by an escort heading for the smoke around {{nowrap|10:50 a.m.}} U-589 dived again, was depth charged several times and destroyed on the eighth attack at {{nowrap|1:07 p.m.}} When the escort made for the convoy, its captain left a shot-down German bomber crew behind. The Swordfish played cat and mouse with Ju 88s and BV 138s, trying to lure them into range of ships' guns and at {{nowrap|12:37 p.m.,}} a German torpedo-bomber formation of III/KG 26 was reported by a Swordfish to be en route for the convoy at wave top height. The torpedo-bomber formation divided to nullify attempts by the ships to evade their attacks.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=273}}\n\n''Avenger'' had a standing patrol of Sea Hurricanes aloft and increased speed to emerge from the head of the convoy and run down the port side. ''Ulster Queen'' also left station to meet the attack along with ''Scylla'' and ''Achates''. During these manoeuvres, Boddam-Whetham ordered another 45\u00b0 emergency turn away.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=273}} The torpedo-bomber formation divided and one part turned towards ''Avenger''; the barrage made the others release their torpedoes too soon, some of which turned over in the air. No hits were achieved and by {{nowrap|12:45 p.m.}} eleven Ju 88s had been shot down. KG 30 arrived and dive-bombed from {{convert|2000|ft|m|abbr=on}} until {{nowrap|2:10 p.m.}} through breaks in the cloud, opposed by the anti-aircraft fire of the convoy and attacks by six Sea Hurricanes. One Ju 88 was shot down as ''Avenger'' and several other ships were near-missed. At {{nowrap|2:05 p.m.}} twenty-two He 111s of I/KG 26 and eighteen Ju 88 torpedo-bombers attacked head on, having received reports that ''Avenger'' was in front the convoy.{{sfn|Thiele|2004|p=46}} The bombers found ''Scylla'' instead and were attacked from behind by Sea Hurricanes, which dived on the formation as it flew into the anti-aircraft barrage. Several torpedo-bomber pilots saw ''Avenger'' and altered course down the starboard side of the convoy to attack. Three of the Sea Hurricanes which followed the German aircraft into the barrage were shot down by the ships, the pilots being rescued by destroyers. Two He 111s aimed at ''Avenger'' which combed the tracks (steered between them) several bombers did not drop and others did at random.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=274\u2013275}}\n\n''Mary Luckenbach'' was torpedoed from {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} by a bomber which strafed the superstructure as it passed overhead, its starboard engine on fire as it crashed into the sea; ''Mary Luckenbach'', the last ship of the ninth and tenth columns, disappeared in a huge explosion. Ships nearby were showered with d\u00e9bris and concussion led the captain of ''Nathaniel Greene'' to order abandon ship, under the impression that it had been torpedoed, until he realised his mistake; two injured gunners were taken off by a destroyer.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=274\u2013275}} Five He 111s crashed near the convoy, four more force-landed in the sea and five of the thirteen survivors were seriously damaged. The British claimed 13 torpedo-bombers for a loss of the three Sea Hurricanes.{{sfn|Thiele|2004|p=46}} ''Luftwaffe'' records show at least 23 aircraft of I/KG 26, III/KG 26, III/KG 30, I.406 and I.906 were destroyed; I/KG 26 was reduced to eight serviceable aircraft.{{sfn|Bekker|1973|p=398}} The crew of one of the shot down bombers was fired on as columns of the convoy passed by. Ju 88s bombers from KG 30 conducted level- and dive-bombing attacks on the escorts until {{nowrap|3:30 p.m.,}} then climbed into the cloud and departed. The Sea Hurricane pilots claimed five bombers and the speed that the escorts had rescued the three shot down pilots raised their morale. ''Avenger'' had achieved a much better radar-controlled fighter interception than the day before. During the evening, PQ 18 passed [[Hope Island (Antarctica)|Hope Island]] and some of the 550 survivors were redistributed, 209 being accommodated on ''Scylla'' and 234 on the fleet destroyers due to return with QP 14. One destroyer bound for Iceland took off the unwounded survivors on ''Copeland'', leaving 96 seriously wounded men being treated.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=275\u2013276}}\n\n===15 September===\n\nDawn on 15 September broke with a calm sea and patchy cloud at {{convert|3000|ft|m|abbr=on}}; during the day the wind rose, bringing showers of rain, sleet and snow. Overnight and in the morning, Huff-Duff detected wireless transmissions from U-boats in the vicinity; Swordfish anti-submarine patrols were flown by ''Avenger'' from first light. German reconnaissance aircraft reached the convoy around {{nowrap|8:00 a.m.}} and near noon, German bombers were detected and Sea Hurricanes scrambled. The raid lasted for about three hours, the bombers attacking through gaps in the cloud cover but fighter attacks and the anti-aircraft fire from the ships prevented accurate bombing. The ''computer'' on ''Scylla'', eavesdropping on [[Hertz|5610kHz]], the ''Luftwaffe'' frequency, heard the dismay of the bomber pilots at the size of the convoy. The Sea Hurricanes managed eventually to keep the bombers circling out of range; ''Ulster Queen'' even managed to shoot down a Ju 88 in cloud, aiming with its [[Fire-control radar|gun-laying radar]]. The last bombers departed at {{nowrap|4:46 p.m.}} but although the weather worsened, U-boat alerts continued all day. Soon after noon, smoke was seen on the horizon, thought to be from surface ships but when an escort steered south-east to check, it turned out to be diesel smoke from two surfaced U-boats. The U-boats crash-dived and a BV 138 nearby was driven off; the ship failed to located the U-boats with Asdic and one of the U-boats made an abortive attack on the ship, which returned to the convoy at {{nowrap|3:45 p.m.}} The weather deterioration continued into the evening and as the destroyer {{HMS|Meteor|G73|2}} returned to its station after dropping back to refuel, a depth-charge attack was made on a \"suspicious object\".{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=276\u2013277}}\n\n===16 September===\n\nU-boat contacts were made all night and at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on 16 September, ''U-457'' sailed beneath the outer anti-submarine screen and prepared to fire a torpedo salvo at the convoy. ''Impulsive'' gained an Asdic contact, made a depth-charge attack and then lost contact amidst the propeller noises of the convoy. The destroyer passed between the merchant ships as they steamed over the position of the attack, found the suggestive smell of oil and bubbles on the sea, claiming a probable; ''U-457'' had been destroyed. Soon after dawn, the first Catalina from Russia arrived, allowing the Swordfish crews to cease their anti-submarine patrols and at {{nowrap|9:00 a.m.}} the convoy turned south, running into mist and rising winds. At {{nowrap|10:40 a.m.,}} two escorts attacked a U-boat but it evaded the attack with a ''Pillenwerfer'', a discharge of compressed air which gave the same Asdic echo as a submarine and the hunt was terminated at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} Wireless contact was made with the homeward QP 14, ready for the changeover and then ''Scylla'' and the FDE departed, along with the ''Avenger'' group, ''Alynbank'' and the two submarine escorts. PQ 18 and the close escort of corvettes, minesweepers and trawlers as a south-easterly gale brought mist and rain. There were constant U-boat alarms and at one point, mines were seen amidst the freighters, leading to the convoy gunners engaging anything seen afloat, to the detriment of seals in the sea, men, superstructure and cargo on other ships.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=277\u2013278}}\n\n===17\u201318 September===\n\n[[Image:KaninNos.JPG|thumb|{{centre|NASA satellite photograph of the Kanin Peninsula}}]]\nThe Soviet destroyers ''[[Gremyashchi]]'' and ''Sokrushitelni'' arrived before noon on 17 September and made a powerful addition to the anti-aircraft firepower of the close escort, ''Kuibishev'' and ''Uritski'' arriving next morning. At {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} on 18 September, the convoy reached [[Kanin Peninsula|Cape Kanin]] as the ''Luftwaffe'' made another ''Goldene Zange'' attack. The last twelve operational He 111 torpedo-bombers of KG 26 attacked at wave-top height from astern as the Ju 88s of KG 30 bombed the convoy. ''Ulster Queen'' turned meet the attack broadside and with the first two Russian destroyers, fired into the sea to create a splash barrage. A witness on ''Copeland'' reported that the bombers\n\n{{quote|Swept in, skimming the water, divided just astern of us and roared past on either side, dropping their fish as they went by. We could see them [torpedoes] leaping clean out of the water like Tarpon before settling down on their course.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=278}}}}\n\n''Kentucky'' was hit amidships and caught fire. The crew abandoned ship to be rescued, despite the sea state, by nearby escorts. A request was sent by wireless to Archangelsk for tugs to be sent as two escorts waited with ''Kentucky''. As a party tried to board, a Ju 88 hit ''Kentucky'' with two bombs and caused more fires, which attracted other bombers to the scene. The escorts tried to finish off the ship with gunfire and then returned to the convoy amidst the ''Goldene Zange''. No Soviet aircraft were available and at {{nowrap|11:50 a.m.}} ''Empire Morn'' launched Flying Officer Burr in his CAM Hurricane, the last air defence of the convoy. Many convoy gunners fired at the Hurricane until it was out of range and Burr also had to weave through the barrage balloons flown by the merchantmen. Burr attacked Heinkels astern of the convoy and obtained a flamer before running out of ammunition. The torpedo-bombers failed to hit any ships for a loss of three bombers and one seriously damaged.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=278\u2013279}}{{efn|Burr declined to ditch and with a course to Archangelsk, landed at Keg Ostrov at {{nowrap|2:45 p.m.}} having almost exhausted his fuel.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=279}}}}\n\nThe ships had been shaken by many near misses by the torpedo-bombers and after the event it was speculated that many of the torpedoes had dud fuzes. In the confusion, the master of ''Empire Tristram'' had thrown overboard the confidential books and begun an abandon ship, before realising his mistake and pressing on. Wild shooting by the convoy gunners wounded one man and hit several aircraft carried on the deck of ''Patrick Henry''. No more torpedo attacks were made on the convoy and soon after, Soviet aircraft appeared and kept away the Ju 88 bombers of KG 30 as the weather deteriorated again. At {{nowrap|4:20 p.m.}} four British local escorts joined the convoy, which split into two columns as dark fell and the tide in the [[Northern Dvina River|Dvina Estuary]] ebbed strongly. Ships crossing the Dvina bar needed navigation beacons but these were not illuminated and some pilot boats failed to appear. PQ 18 had to drop anchor and spend the night riding out a north-westerly gale against a [[Lee shore]]. Some ships dragged their anchors or lost them, others started engines and managed to move away from the shore and [[Heaving to|heave to]] and two trawlers used their last coal to steam into wind. One ship had to be steered by hand after the steering gear broke down, ''Exford'' lost both anchors and several ships made for the estuary.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=280\u2013281}}\n\n===20\u201327 September===\n\n[[File:Severnaya Dvina eng.svg|thumb|{{centre|Map of the Northern Dvina river (Archangelsk top left)}}]]\nBy dawn on 20 September, five ships were aground and an attempt by two corvettes to tow off a trawler failed. ''Campfire'', aground, was full of explosives; the captain ordered the crew to abandon and make for Modyugski Island, which was achieved despite the storm and on 21 September, in better weather, the master and several volunteers re-boarded. For the rest of 20 September, the ships waited for the storm to abate and as the winds fell in the afternoon, twelve Ju 88 bombers appeared through the cloud at {{nowrap|3:40 p.m.}} and attacked, achieving only several near-misses. On 21 September, pilot boats came out and the ships were guided into port. Three warships stayed behind to guard the grounded ships, which were attacked at {{nowrap|3:45 p.m.}} by two Ju 88s which had more near misses. As the ships moved upstream, Archangelsk was bombed but the raid hit the town, rather than the port. For several days, cargo on the ships stranded on the sandbar was transferred to two [[heavy lift]] ships by lighters and a salvage ship, all the ships being re-floated by 27 September; the last ship was re-floated later; discharging the ships took a month. At a reception to celebrate the arrival of PQ 18, the convoy Commodore Boddam-Whetham, was cheered to the rafters.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\nIn the official history (1956 [1962]) [[Stephen Roskill]] called PQ 18 an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] success but in 2004, Richard Woodman referred to it as a [[pyrrhic victory]]. The convoy operation brought 28 ships safely to their destinations and the Arctic convoy route, which had been suspended since the loss of PQ 17, was open again.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|p=287}} The ''Luftwaffe'' torpedo-bomber attacks, while costly, had been highly effective and would have inflicted more losses, had not the British Headache operator not given early warning of some attacks, which enabled Sea Hurricanes to be scrambled in time.{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|p=156}} The Germans failed to prevent the convoy reaching Russia and their losses, particularly in trained pilots, were severe, reducing the ability of the ''Luftwaffe'' to repeat its anti-convoy operation. Attacks on ''Avenger'' had been defeated and the depth of the escort screen made torpedo attacks on the centre of the convoy extravagantly risky.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=283}} [[Coastal Command]] operations in support of PQ 18 and the returning convoy QP 14, involved 111 aircraft from 14 squadrons, which flew 279 sorties and logged 2,290 flying hours, most being taken up by the fights to and from the convoy.{{sfn|Richards|Saunders|1975|p=85}} In November, ''Luftflotte'' 5, the German air command in Norway and Finland, was ordered to transfer its Ju 88 and He 111 torpedo-bombers to the Mediterranean against [[Operation Torch]], a decision which the British received through Ultra intercepts. Only the Heinkel 115 floatplanes, suitable for torpedo attacks on stragglers and some Ju 87 dive-bombers remained in Norway, along with a few long-range reconnaissance aircraft to observe for the surface and U-boat forces.{{sfn|PRO|2001|p=115}}\n\n===Casualties and losses===\nThe Germans managed to sink thirteen merchant ships for a loss of four U-boats and 44 aircraft including 38 torpedo-bombers and six long range bombers and reconnaissance aircraft.{{sfnm|1a1=Woodman|1y=2004|1p=280|2a1=Roskill|2y=1962|2p=287}} In ''Grand Strategy'' (1972) Michael Howard recorded the loss of 38 aircraft from 309, 126 tanks from 448 and 85 of the 106 lorries carried in the convoy. PQ 19 was assembled at Loch Ewe but not dispatched, amounting to a nett loss to the Allied war effort.{{sfn||Howard|1972|p=42}} In the German semi-official history ''[[Germany and the Second World War]]'' (2001) Werner Rahn wrote that the German losses were three U-boats and 22 aircraft during the attacks on the convoy.{{sfn|Rahn|2001|p=456}}\n\n==Merchant ships==\n\n{{main|Order of battle for Convoy PQ 18}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* SS ''Africander'' - [[Panama]]nian (Sunk in air attack)\n* SS ''Andre Marti'' - [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]\n* {{MV|Atheltemplar||2}} - [[United Kingdom|British]] (Sunk by {{GS|U-408||2}} after being damaged by ''U-457'')\n* SS ''Black Ranger'' - British\n* SS ''Campfire'' - [[United States|American]]\n* SS ''Charles R.

The convoy departed [[Loch Ewe]], [[Scotland]] on 2 September 1942, rendezvoused with more ships and escorts at Iceland and arrived at Arkhangelsk on 21 September. An exceptionally large number of escorts was provided by the [[Royal Navy]] in Operation EV, including the first escort carrier to accompany an Arctic convoy. Detailed information on German intentions was provided by the code breakers at [[Bletchley Park]] and elsewhere, through [[Ultra]] signals decrypts and eavesdropping on ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' wireless communications.\n\nThe German ''[[B-Dienst]]'' read some British signals and ''Luftwaffe'' used the lull in convoys after [[Convoy PQ 17]] (27 June \u2013 10 July) to prepare a maximum effort with the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]''. From 12 to 21 September PQ 18 was attacked by bombers, torpedo-bombers, U-boats and mines, which sank thirteen ships at a cost of  forty-four aircraft and four U-boats. The convoy was defended by escort ships and the aircraft of the escort carrier {{HMS|Avenger|D14|6}} which used signals intelligence gleaned from Ultra and ''Luftwaffe'' wireless frequencies to provide early warning of some air attacks and to attempt evasive routeing of the convoy around concentrations of U-boats. [[United States Navy Armed Guard]] and British [[Defensively equipped merchant ship|Naval]] and [[Royal Artillery]] Maritime Regiment gunners were embarked on the freighters to operate anti-aircraft guns and barrage balloons, which made air attacks more difficult and because of inexperience, occasionally wounded men and damaged ships and cargo, with wild shooting.\n\nThe convoy handed over its distant escorts and ''Avenger'' to the homeward bound [[Convoy QP 14]] near Archangelsk on 16 September and continued with the close escort and local escorts, riding out a storm in the Northern Dvina estuary and the last attacks by the ''Luftwaffe'', before reaching Archangelsk on 21 September. Several ships ran aground in the storm but all were eventually refloated; unloading the convoy took a month. Because of its losses and the transfer in November of its most effective remaining aircraft to the Mediterranean to oppose [[Operation Torch]], the ''Luftwaffe'' effort could never be repeated.\n\n==Background==\n\n===Arctic convoys===\n\n{{main|Arctic convoys of World War II|Home Fleet}}\n\nIn October 1941, after [[Operation Barbarossa]], the German invasion of the [[USSR]], which had begun on 22 June, the Prime Minister, [[Winston Churchill]], made a commitment to send a convoy to the Arctic ports of the USSR every ten days and to deliver {{nowrap|1,200 tanks}} a month from July 1942 to January 1943, followed by {{nowrap|2,000 tanks}} and another {{nowrap|3,600 aircraft}} more than already promised.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=22}}{{efn|In October 1941, the unloading capacity of Archangel was {{convert|300000|LT|t|0|abbr=on}}, Vladivostok {{convert|140000|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|60000|LT|t|0|abbr=on}} in the Persian Gulf ports.{{sfn|Howard|1972|p=44}}}} The first convoy was due at Murmansk around 12 October and the next convoy was to depart Iceland on 22 October. A motley of British, Allied and neutral shipping loaded with military stores and raw materials for the Soviet war effort would be assembled at Hvalfjordur, Iceland, convenient for ships from both sides of the Atlantic.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|p=14}} By late 1941, the convoy system used in the Atlantic had been established on the Arctic run; a [[convoy commodore]] ensured that the ships' masters and signals officers attended a briefing before sailing to make arrangements for the management of the convoy, which sailed in a formation of long rows of short columns. The commodore was usually a retired naval officer, aboard a ship identified by a white pendant with a blue cross. The commodore was assisted by a Naval signals party of four men, who used lamps, semaphore flags and telescopes to pass signals, coded from books carried in a bag, weighted to be dumped overboard. In large convoys, the commodore was assisted by vice- and rear-commodores who directed the speed, course and zig-zagging of the merchant ships and liaised with the escort commander.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=22\u201323}}{{efn|By the end of 1941, 187 [[Matilda II]] and 249 [[Valentine tank]]s had been delivered, comprising 25 percent of the medium-heavy tanks in the Red Army, making 30\u201340 percent of the medium-heavy tanks defending Moscow. In December 1941, 16 perent of the fighters defending Moscow were [[Hawker Hurricane]]s and [[Curtiss P-40 Warhawk|Curtiss Tomahawks]] from Britain and by 1 January 1942, 96 Hurricane fighters were flying in the [[Soviet Air Forces]] (''Voyenno-Vozdushnye Sily'', VVS). The British supplied radar apparatus, machine tools, [[Asdic]] and commodities.{{sfn|Edgerton|2011|p=75}}}}\n\nFollowing [[Convoy PQ 16]] and the disaster to [[Convoy PQ 17]] in July 1942, Arctic convoys were postponed for nine weeks and much of the Home Fleet was detached to the Mediterranean for [[Operation Pedestal]], a [[Malta]] convoy. During the lull, Admiral [[John Tovey, 1st Baron Tovey|John Tovey]] concluded that the Home Fleet had been of no great protection to convoys beyond Bear Island, midway between [[Spitsbergen]] and the [[North Cape, Norway|North Cape]]. Tovey would oversee the operation from [[Scapa Flow]], where the fleet was linked to the Admiralty by landline, immune to variations in wireless reception. The next convoy should be accompanied by sufficient protection against surface attack; the longer-range destroyers of the Home Fleet could be used to augment the close escort force of anti-submarine and anti-aircraft ships, to confront a sortie by German ships with the threat of a massed destroyer torpedo attack. The practice of meeting homeward-bound QP convoys near Bear Island was dispensed with and QP 14 was to wait until PQ 18 was near its destination, despite the longer journey being more demanding of crews, fuel and equipment. The new [[escort carrier]] {{HMS|Avenger|D14|6}} (Commander A. P. Colthurst) had arrived from the [[United States]] and was added to the escort force, to give the convoy air cover.{{sfn|Roskill|1962|pp=278\u2013281}}\n\n===Signals intelligence===\n\n====Bletchley Park====\n\n{{main|Ultra}}\n\nThe British [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&CS) based at [[Bletchley Park]] housed a small industry of code-breakers and [[Traffic analysis|traffic analysts]]. By June 1941, the German [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] machine Home Waters (''Heimish'') settings used by surface ships and U-boats could quickly be read. On 1 February 1942, the Enigma machines used in U-boats in the Atlantic and Mediterranean were changed but German ships and the U-boats in Arctic waters continued with the older ''Heimish'' (''Hyrda'' from 1942, Dolphin to the British). By mid-1941, British [[Y-stations]] were able to receive and read ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' [[Wireless telegraphy|W/T]] transmissions and give advance warning of ''Luftwaffe'' operations. In 1941, naval Headache personnel with receivers to eavesdrop on ''Luftwaffe'' wireless transmissions were embarked on warships and from May 1942, ships gained RAF Y ''computor'' parties, which sailed with cruiser admirals in command of convoy escorts, to interpret ''Luftwaffe'' W/T signals intercepted by the Headaches. The Admiralty sent details of ''Luftwaffe'' wireless frequencies, call signs and the daily local codes to the computors, which combined with their knowledge of ''Luftwaffe'' procedures, could glean fairly accurate details of German reconnaissance sorties. Sometimes computors predicted attacks twenty minutes before they were detected by radar.{{sfn|Macksey|2004|pp=141\u2013142}}{{sfn|Hinsley|1994|pp=141, 145\u2013146}}\n\n====B-Dienst====\n\n{{main|B-Dienst}}\n\nThe rival German [[B-Dienst|''Beobachtungsdienst'']] (''B-Dienst'', Observation Service) of the ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'' [[German Naval Intelligence Service|''Marinenachrichtendienst'']] (''MND'', Naval Intelligence Service) had broken several Admiralty codes and cyphers by 1939, which were used to help ''Kriegsmarine'' ships elude British forces and provide opportunities for surprise attacks. From June to August 1940, six British submarines were sunk in the Skaggerak using information gleaned from British wireless signals. In 1941, ''B-Dienst'' read signals from the Commander in Chief Western Approaches informing convoys of areas patrolled by U-boats, enabling the submarines to move into \"safe\" zones.{{sfn|Kahn|1973|pp=238\u2013241}} ''B-Dienst'' had broken Naval Cypher No 3 in February 1942 and by March was reading up to 80 percent of the traffic, which continued until 15 December 1943. By coincidence, the British lost access to the ''Shark'' cypher so had no information to send in Cypher No 3 which might compromise Ultra.{{sfn|Budiansky|2000|pp=250, 289}} In early September, [[Finnish Defence Intelligence Agency#1939\u20131944|Finnish Radio Intelligence]] deciphered a Soviet Air Force transmission, which divulged the convoy itinerary and was forwarded it to the Germans.{{sfn|FIB|1996|nopp=y}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\n===Operation Orator===\n\n{{main|Operation Orator}}\n\n[[File:Polar siberia 4.png|thumb|{{centre|Arctic Ocean, Murmansk and Archangesk}}]]\nAn anti-shipping force (Group Captain [[F.

The relatively short range of the Hampdens and the limited navigational equipment on board and the weather caused the loss of several Hampdens and others were shot down en route. Six bombers crashed in Sweden or German-occupied [[Norway]] and plans for PQ 18 and QP 14 were recovered by the Germans from one of the aircraft. Two Hampdens ran out of fuel and force-landed in Russia, one a write-off; one aircraft arrived over the Kola Inlet during an air raid and was shot down into the sea by Russian fighters.{{sfn|Smith|1975|p=124}} The aircraft sank with the wounded air gunner on board and the rest of the crew were [[Strafing|strafed]] in the sea.

German reconnaissance aircraft reached the convoy around {{nowrap|8:00 a.m.}} and near noon, German bombers were detected and Sea Hurricanes scrambled. The raid lasted for about three hours, the bombers attacking through gaps in the cloud cover but fighter attacks and the anti-aircraft fire from the ships prevented accurate bombing. The ''computer'' on ''Scylla'', eavesdropping on [[Hertz|5610kHz]], the ''Luftwaffe'' frequency, heard the dismay of the bomber pilots at the size of the convoy. The Sea Hurricanes managed eventually to keep the bombers circling out of range; ''Ulster Queen'' even managed to shoot down a Ju 88 in cloud, aiming with its [[Fire-control radar|gun-laying radar]]. The last bombers departed at {{nowrap|4:46 p.m.}} but although the weather worsened, U-boat alerts continued all day. Soon after noon, smoke was seen on the horizon, thought to be from surface ships but when an escort steered south-east to check, it turned out to be diesel smoke from two surfaced U-boats. The U-boats crash-dived and a BV 138 nearby was driven off; the ship failed to located the U-boats with Asdic and one of the U-boats made an abortive attack on the ship, which returned to the convoy at {{nowrap|3:45 p.m.}} The weather deterioration continued into the evening and as the destroyer {{HMS|Meteor|G73|2}} returned to its station after dropping back to refuel, a depth-charge attack was made on a \"suspicious object\".{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=276\u2013277}}\n\n===16 September===\n\nU-boat contacts were made all night and at {{nowrap|3:00 a.m.}} on 16 September, ''U-457'' sailed beneath the outer anti-submarine screen and prepared to fire a torpedo salvo at the convoy. ''Impulsive'' gained an Asdic contact, made a depth-charge attack and then lost contact amidst the propeller noises of the convoy. The destroyer passed between the merchant ships as they steamed over the position of the attack, found the suggestive smell of oil and bubbles on the sea, claiming a probable; ''U-457'' had been destroyed. Soon after dawn, the first Catalina from Russia arrived, allowing the Swordfish crews to cease their anti-submarine patrols and at {{nowrap|9:00 a.m.}} the convoy turned south, running into mist and rising winds. At {{nowrap|10:40 a.m.,}} two escorts attacked a U-boat but it evaded the attack with a ''Pillenwerfer'', a discharge of compressed air which gave the same Asdic echo as a submarine and the hunt was terminated at {{nowrap|1:00 p.m.}} Wireless contact was made with the homeward QP 14, ready for the changeover and then ''Scylla'' and the FDE departed, along with the ''Avenger'' group, ''Alynbank'' and the two submarine escorts. PQ 18 and the close escort of corvettes, minesweepers and trawlers as a south-easterly gale brought mist and rain. There were constant U-boat alarms and at one point, mines were seen amidst the freighters, leading to the convoy gunners engaging anything seen afloat, to the detriment of seals in the sea, men, superstructure and cargo on other ships.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=277\u2013278}}\n\n===17\u201318 September===\n\n[[Image:KaninNos.JPG|thumb|{{centre|NASA satellite photograph of the Kanin Peninsula}}]]\nThe Soviet destroyers ''[[Gremyashchi]]'' and ''Sokrushitelni'' arrived before noon on 17 September and made a powerful addition to the anti-aircraft firepower of the close escort, ''Kuibishev'' and ''Uritski'' arriving next morning. At {{nowrap|6:00 a.m.}} on 18 September, the convoy reached [[Kanin Peninsula|Cape Kanin]] as the ''Luftwaffe'' made another ''Goldene Zange'' attack. The last twelve operational He 111 torpedo-bombers of KG 26 attacked at wave-top height from astern as the Ju 88s of KG 30 bombed the convoy. ''Ulster Queen'' turned meet the attack broadside and with the first two Russian destroyers, fired into the sea to create a splash barrage. A witness on ''Copeland'' reported that the bombers\n\n{{quote|Swept in, skimming the water, divided just astern of us and roared past on either side, dropping their fish as they went by.

As a party tried to board, a Ju 88 hit ''Kentucky'' with two bombs and caused more fires, which attracted other bombers to the scene. The escorts tried to finish off the ship with gunfire and then returned to the convoy amidst the ''Goldene Zange''. No Soviet aircraft were available and at {{nowrap|11:50 a.m.}} ''Empire Morn'' launched Flying Officer Burr in his CAM Hurricane, the last air defence of the convoy. Many convoy gunners fired at the Hurricane until it was out of range and Burr also had to weave through the barrage balloons flown by the merchantmen.

Wild shooting by the convoy gunners wounded one man and hit several aircraft carried on the deck of ''Patrick Henry''.

At {{nowrap|4:20 p.m.}} four British local escorts joined the convoy, which split into two columns as dark fell and the tide in the [[Northern Dvina River|Dvina Estuary]] ebbed strongly. Ships crossing the Dvina bar needed navigation beacons but these were not illuminated and some pilot boats failed to appear. PQ 18 had to drop anchor and spend the night riding out a north-westerly gale against a [[Lee shore]]. Some ships dragged their anchors or lost them, others started engines and managed to move away from the shore and [[Heaving to|heave to]] and two trawlers used their last coal to steam into wind.

''Campfire'', aground, was full of explosives; the captain ordered the crew to abandon and make for Modyugski Island, which was achieved despite the storm and on 21 September, in better weather, the master and several volunteers re-boarded. For the rest of 20 September, the ships waited for the storm to abate and as the winds fell in the afternoon, twelve Ju 88 bombers appeared through the cloud at {{nowrap|3:40 p.m.}} and attacked, achieving only several near-misses. On 21 September, pilot boats came out and the ships were guided into port. Three warships stayed behind to guard the grounded ships, which were attacked at {{nowrap|3:45 p.m.}} by two Ju 88s which had more near misses. As the ships moved upstream, Archangelsk was bombed but the raid hit the town, rather than the port. For several days, cargo on the ships stranded on the sandbar was transferred to two [[heavy lift]] ships by lighters and a salvage ship, all the ships being re-floated by 27 September; the last ship was re-floated later; discharging the ships took a month. At a reception to celebrate the arrival of PQ 18, the convoy Commodore Boddam-Whetham, was cheered to the rafters.{{sfn|Woodman|2004|pp=281\u2013282}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\nIn the official history (1956 [1962]) [[Stephen Roskill]] called PQ 18 an [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] success but in 2004, Richard Woodman referred to it as a [[pyrrhic victory]].

According to ''Naanyaa.aay\u00ed'' clan traditions, Tlingit people migrated down the Stikine River during a time when the river still flowed underneath glaciers. The population slowly moved down the river, settling in different locations such as ''Tl\u00e1kw.aan'' \"Ancient Village\", ''S\u02bcikn\u00e1x\u0331'' \"Across from the Grass\", ''Shaal.aan'' \"Fish Trap Town\", ''Xakw.aan'' \"Sandbar Village\", and ''Kay\u00e1ash'' \"Platform\", Hehl (Xel/Xehl) \"Foam People\", Hehl being the senior of house of the village.\n\nLater settlements on the coast included ''Ch\u02bcux\u02bc\u00e1as\u02bcaan'' \"Waterfall Town\" (now Mill Creek), ''\u1e34eishangita.aan'' \"Red Alder Head Village\" (site of the Wrangell Institute at Shoemaker Bay), ''K\u02bcaats\u02bc\u1e35u Noow'' \"Among the Sharps Fort\" (now Anita Bay), ''An.\u00e1an'' \"Village that Rests\" (now Anan Bear Viewing Area), and many others. The numerous [[petroglyphs]] found at [[Petroglyph Beach State Historic Park|Petroglyph Beach]] just north of Wrangell, as well as those scattered on the beaches of the many islands in the vicinity, attest to the long Tlingit presence.\n\nIt is also known and somewhat forgotten, that first peoples coastal migration to the Stikine River happened from the south.  The Nass River people had several migrations into the area.  The  \"Git Setti\" people tell of their migration story in a totem raised in Wrangell in 1894 called \"Kickssetti\" Totem.\n\nThe salt water inlet that is now Wrangell Harbor was traditionally called ''\u1e34aachx\u0331ana.\u00e1ak\u02bcw'', literally \"''\u1e34aachx\u0331\u00e1n'''s little lake\". Before the harbor mouth was dredged and cleared in the late 19th century, the mouth of this inlet would often go dry at low tide, which led to its being called a lake.\n\n''\u1e34aachx\u0331\u00e1n'' was a man from the village variously known as ''\u1e34aalch\u02bcal\u02bcaan'' (''Kotzlitzan'') or ''Ch\u02bcaal\u02bc\u00edt.aan,'' meaning \"Willow House Village\"; or ''Shaax\u0331\u00edt.aan'' meaning \"Driftwood House Village.\"  The village site today is known as \"Old Town\" or \"Old Wrangell\" (located at {{Coord|56|12|28|N|132|16|22|W|type:landmark}}). ''\u1e34aachx\u0331\u00e1n'' was supposedly a hermit who preferred living away from his relatives, and lived in a smokehouse located on the rear shore of the lake, which was named after him.\n\n===19th century===\n{{Further|Fort Stikine}}\n[[File:Wrangel Village 1868.jpg|thumb|left|Village of Wrangel Alaska (Tlingit: \u1e34aachx\u0331aana.\u00e1ak\u02bcw) in 1868, present-day Front Street.]]\nWrangell was founded by Russians as one of the oldest non-Native settlements in Alaska. They started trading for furs with area Tlingit in 1811 at the site of present-day Wrangell.  In 1834, Baron [[Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel]], then head of Russian government interests in [[Russian America]], ordered a stockade built near the ''Naanyaa.aay\u00ed'' clan house of [[Chief Shakes]], called ''Sh\u00e9iksh H\u00eddi''. This house was located about {{convert|13|mi|km|0}} north of Old Wrangell, on a small island in the middle of what is today Wrangell Harbor.  The stockade, named Redoubt Saint Dionysius (''\u0420\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0442\u044a \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442\u044a \u0414\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0456\u0443\u0441\u044a''), was founded at the location of present-day Wrangell and stood near the end of the small peninsula that forms the northeastern side of the mouth of the harbor.\n\nThe British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) leased the fort in 1839 and named the stockade [[Fort Stikine]]. The Tlingit had used the [[Stikine River]] as a trade route to the interior since ancient times, and they protested when the Hudson's Bay Company began to use their trade routes.  Two [[epidemic]]s of [[smallpox]] in 1836 and 1840 sharply reduced the Tlingit population in the area by half, as they had no acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], and silenced most of the protest.\n\nThe HBC abandoned the fort in 1849 after the area's stocks of [[sea otter]] and [[American Beaver|beaver]] were depleted, ending the fur trade.  Fort Stikine remained under British rule until Alaska's [[Alaska Purchase|purchase]] by the United States in 1867.\n\n[[File:Wrangell, Alaska by LaRoche, c1897.jpg|thumb|right|Bird's Eye view, 1897]]\nIn 1868, the U.S. built a military post called '''Fort Wrangell''' at the site, and it remained active until 1877. The community around the post continued to grow through commerce with prospectors in the [[gold rush]]es of 1861, 1874&ndash;77, and 1897.  As in [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], businessmen looking to make money off the miners built many gambling halls, dance halls, and bars. Thousands of miners traveled up the Stikine River into the [[Cassiar, British Columbia|Cassiar District]] of [[British Columbia]] during 1874, and again to the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] in 1897.\n\nThe [[Wrangell Bombardment]] occurred on the 25th of December 1869 when a [[Stikine people|Stikine Indian]] named Lowan bit off Mrs. Jaboc Muller's third right finger, and was killed in an ensuing fight by soldiers who mortally wounded an additional Stikine Indian. The following morning, Scutd-doo, who was the father of the deceased, entered the fort and shot the post trader's partner [[Leon Smith (naval commander)|Leon Smith]] fourteen times. Smith died some 13 hours later. The US army made an ultimatum demanding Sccutd-doo's surrender, and following bombardment of the Stikine Indian village, the villagers handed Scutd-doo over to the military in the fort, where he was court-martialed and publicly hanged before the garrison and assembled natives on 29 December,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FXeNAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=%22leon+smith%22+1869&source=bl&ots=6ZsKuM3Knw&sig=3Gz5QhHJfXcRs5GjV-Yo54ltITs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs9f29w-XVAhUCuBoKHWEkDQQ4ChDoAQhEMAo#v=onepage&q=%22leon%20smith%22%201869&f=false The Aleut Internments of World War II: Islanders Removed from Their Homes by the United States], Russell W.

Reverend [[S. Hall Young]], a colleague of [[Sheldon Jackson]], was assigned to the Wrangell mission and arrived on July 10, 1878.<ref>Young, S. Hall. 1927. ''Hall Young of Alaska''. Fleming Revell.</ref> He worked among both miners and Tlingits.  He established the Fort Wrangell Tlingit Industrial School to teach young Tlingit men various American trades, such as printing, boatbuilding, and construction. This institution was a parallel to Sheldon Jackson's Sitka Industrial Training School, which became [[Sheldon Jackson College]]. Young's school was the nucleus of the later [[Wrangell Institute]], a [[Indian boarding school|boarding school]] for [[Alaska Natives]] through the mid-20th century.\n\nS. Hall Young was a friend and companion of the [[naturalist]] [[John Muir]], who lived in Wrangell in 1879\u20131880.<ref>Muir, John. 1909. ''[[Stickeen: An Adventure with a Dog and a Glacier]]''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.</ref><ref>Muir, John. 1915. ''Travels in Alaska''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.</ref> Muir and Young traveled up the Stikine River, as well as to [[Kake, Alaska|Kake]], [[Glacier Bay]], and elsewhere in Southeast Alaska. Young and Muir were accompanied by two Stikine elite men, ''T\u02bcaawyaat'' (\"Toyatte\", lit. Long Feather), and ''Kaadaashaan'' (\"Kadachan\"), as well Sitka Charley, as a young man who was their interpreter in [[Chinook Jargon]] and [[English language|English]].\n\nThe oldest Catholic Church in Alaska; St. Rose of Lima, was established at Wrangell May 4, 1879.\n\nHaving been Tlingit territory and then under the jurisdiction of Russia, Great Britain, and the United States, Wrangell has the unique status as the only Alaskan city to have been governed under four \"flags\".\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Scow loaded with salmon at the Alaska Packers Association cannery, Wrangell, Alaska, 1918 (COBB 114).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Scow loaded with salmon at the Alaska Packers Association cannery in Wrangell, 1918]]\n[[Fish traps]] were constructed in the late 1890s on the nearby mouth of the [[Stikine River]] and in the [[Zimovia Strait]]. These contributed to the growth of the fishing and fish canning industries in Wrangell, which provided much of the economic life for the town before the rise of logging in the 1950s. The fish traps caused severe damage to the [[Stikine River]] salmon runs, reducing the number of fish that managed to spawn and causing a decline in salmon runs and fishing in the region.  After statehood, the new government decommissioned all fish traps in Alaska. The fishing industry remained strong, and continues to be the primary occupation of many residents.\n\nThe weekly [[newspaper]], ''[[The Wrangell Sentinel]]'', was founded in 1902, and printed its first issue on November 2 of that year. The newspaper remains in publication with only a few short periods of inactivity.  It is the oldest continuously published newspaper in Alaska.\n\n[[File:Scowload of salmon at cannery dock, Wrangell, Alaska, August 1918 (COBB 116).jpeg|thumb|Scow with salmon is unloaded at a cannery's dock in Wrangell, 1918]]\nThe renowned [[Bear Totem Store]], built in the 1920s by [[Walter Waters]], housed innumerable examples of Tlingit arts and crafts, as well as a number of irreplaceable [[totem pole]]s.  Waters began his business career carrying mail by boat from Wrangell to Sulzer.  During this period, he traveled throughout southeast Alaska as a fur buyer.  While on business travels, Waters began to acquire Indian artifacts and make valuable contacts with Indian artisans. He eventually enabled him to open his curio shop, The Bear Totem Store.\n\nA severe fire in the early 1950s burned much of the downtown area, destroying the Bear Totem Store and most of its contents. Few historic buildings remained after the fire. The disaster dramatically changed the face of Wrangell, and with new buildings, the past was lost.\n\nLogging, fishing and tourism are the current mainstays of the Wrangell area economy. One of the last two major sawmills in southeast Alaska is operated by the Silver Bay Logging Company just south of the city proper.\n\nThe community has always been a center of the Tlingit ''Kaach.\u00e0di'', ''Kiks.\u00e1di'' and ''Naanyaa.aay\u00ed'' clans, as well as the only home of the ''Kayaashkiditaan'', ''S\u02bciknax\u0331.\u00e1di'', ''X\u0331ook\u02bceid\u00ed'', ''Kaasx\u0331\u02bcagweid\u00ed'', and ''Taal\u1e35weid\u00ed'' clans.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Traditional Tlingit Map and Tribal List\n| publisher = Tlingit Readers, Inc.\n| url = http://www.ankn.uaf.edu/ANCR/Southeast/TlingitMap/\n| accessdate = 2009-06-21\n}}</ref> [[Chief Shakes]] Tribal House, which is known in Tlingit as ''Sh\u00e9iksh H\u00eddi'' \"Shakes House\", is a replica of traditional Tlingit houses.

Boatyards have increased in scale allowing storage and repairs of larger vessels. The city has a picturesque golf course with a view of Mt. Wrangell. Like many S.E. Alaskan communities state government spending is important to the local economy, though not to the extent of Juneau-the state capitol. The Federal government also kicks in a share with the forest service, postal service and homeland security operations expenditures.\nThe southernmost terminus of the vast Juneau ice field is just north of the Stikine with several glaciers flowing down to the river and saltwater at [[LeConte Bay]]. Though Chinook salmon have been devastated by commercial over-harvesting recently and the fishery was largely closed in spring 2018, hope for its recovery abounds since fisheries have crashed in S.E. Alaska recurrently over history and recovered.\n\n[[File:Worker preparing crabs for shipment or sale, Wrangell, Alaska, September 3, 1910 (COBB 272).jpeg|thumb|left|Preparing crabs for shipment at Andrew Arneson's place, September 1910]]\nWhales live seasonally in the waters of the Alexander Archipelago<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Alexander-Archipelago</ref> and visit Wrangell searching for herring and salmon creating good photo opportunities.

In order to keep a small-town rural aesthetic the city turned down the prospect of building a state prison and home-porting a naval vessel. The Stikine Inn was remodeled to fine shape, and an inter-island ferry business was established with service to Prince of Whales Island. Sunrise aviation- an air work and tourism float plane service, continues to provide service anywhere in the region, though helicopter journeys to high mountain glaciers need to be scheduled from Ketchikan to the south 100 miles (Ketchikan is from the Tlingit word Kootchikan meaning place of stinky fish).\n\nBaron Von Wrangell sent Lieutenant Dionysius Zarembo to establish a trading post on Stikine Strait in 1833 to beat the Brits. Tlingits apparently were receptive to British and Russian traders. Today nearby Zarembo island has an elk and moose population visited by hunting guides and parties from Wrangell.\n\nA marijuana sales business was placed in the back of a restaurant downtown. Alaska Airlines creates a few local jobs with twice daily service to Seattle and Juneau, Ketchikan, Sitka and other S.E. destinations and the Alaska Marine Highway system has a terminal with a few workers where dock ferryboats, near the Stikine Inn. Wrangell's seafood processing plant, though small and consuming much of the city's water supply seasonally, has employed workers from Mexico, Russia and Somalia in recent years.\n[[File:Stikine_River_Delta.jpg|thumb|left|Stikine River Delta]]\nWrangell has several churches and bars and a pizza store though no citywide free wireless internet for tourists or business travelers yet.

Alaska. It is possible to follow the historic route in kayaks to the Stikine River Delta where the orphan warrior Chief Gush X'een and his band of Tlingits defeated boatloads of invading Nisga'a warriors from the south. Rather than becoming a slave the defeated Nisga'a Chief surrendered his hat and title of ''[[Shakes (Tlingit leaders)|Shakes]]'' to Gush X'een.\n\nThe former mill site of the Alaska Pulp Corporation that was dismantled has some use sending logs and boulders via ships and a prospect for development as a cruise ship site with multipurpose western theme shops and dark ale brewery for export. The city has expanded its electrical power lines a mile and a half south on Isheyami Drive to allow a concrete production facility to power up (they bring in sand via barge from the Stikine River).\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 106\n|1890= 316\n|1900= 868\n|1910= 743\n|1920= 821\n|1930= 948\n|1940= 1162\n|1950= 1263\n|1960= 1315\n|1970= 2029\n|1980= 2184\n|1990= 2479\n|2000= 2308\n|2010= 2369\n|estyear=2019\n|estimate=2502\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nWrangell first appeared as an unincorporated village on the 1880 U.S. Census.

According to ''Naanyaa.aay\u00ed'' clan traditions, Tlingit people migrated down the Stikine River during a time when the river still flowed underneath glaciers. The population slowly moved down the river, settling in different locations such as ''Tl\u00e1kw.aan'' \"Ancient Village\", ''S\u02bcikn\u00e1x\u0331'' \"Across from the Grass\", ''Shaal.aan'' \"Fish Trap Town\", ''Xakw.aan'' \"Sandbar Village\", and ''Kay\u00e1ash'' \"Platform\", Hehl (Xel/Xehl) \"Foam People\", Hehl being the senior of house of the village.\n\nLater settlements on the coast included ''Ch\u02bcux\u02bc\u00e1as\u02bcaan'' \"Waterfall Town\" (now Mill Creek), ''\u1e34eishangita.aan'' \"Red Alder Head Village\" (site of the Wrangell Institute at Shoemaker Bay), ''K\u02bcaats\u02bc\u1e35u Noow'' \"Among the Sharps Fort\" (now Anita Bay), ''An.\u00e1an'' \"Village that Rests\" (now Anan Bear Viewing Area), and many others. The numerous [[petroglyphs]] found at [[Petroglyph Beach State Historic Park|Petroglyph Beach]] just north of Wrangell, as well as those scattered on the beaches of the many islands in the vicinity, attest to the long Tlingit presence.\n\nIt is also known and somewhat forgotten, that first peoples coastal migration to the Stikine River happened from the south.  The Nass River people had several migrations into the area.  The  \"Git Setti\" people tell of their migration story in a totem raised in Wrangell in 1894 called \"Kickssetti\" Totem.\n\nThe salt water inlet that is now Wrangell Harbor was traditionally called ''\u1e34aachx\u0331ana.\u00e1ak\u02bcw'', literally \"''\u1e34aachx\u0331\u00e1n'''s little lake\". Before the harbor mouth was dredged and cleared in the late 19th century, the mouth of this inlet would often go dry at low tide, which led to its being called a lake.\n\n''\u1e34aachx\u0331\u00e1n'' was a man from the village variously known as ''\u1e34aalch\u02bcal\u02bcaan'' (''Kotzlitzan'') or ''Ch\u02bcaal\u02bc\u00edt.aan,'' meaning \"Willow House Village\"; or ''Shaax\u0331\u00edt.aan'' meaning \"Driftwood House Village.\"  The village site today is known as \"Old Town\" or \"Old Wrangell\" (located at {{Coord|56|12|28|N|132|16|22|W|type:landmark}}). ''\u1e34aachx\u0331\u00e1n'' was supposedly a hermit who preferred living away from his relatives, and lived in a smokehouse located on the rear shore of the lake, which was named after him.\n\n===19th century===\n{{Further|Fort Stikine}}\n[[File:Wrangel Village 1868.jpg|thumb|left|Village of Wrangel Alaska (Tlingit: \u1e34aachx\u0331aana.\u00e1ak\u02bcw) in 1868, present-day Front Street.]]\nWrangell was founded by Russians as one of the oldest non-Native settlements in Alaska. They started trading for furs with area Tlingit in 1811 at the site of present-day Wrangell.  In 1834, Baron [[Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel]], then head of Russian government interests in [[Russian America]], ordered a stockade built near the ''Naanyaa.aay\u00ed'' clan house of [[Chief Shakes]], called ''Sh\u00e9iksh H\u00eddi''. This house was located about {{convert|13|mi|km|0}} north of Old Wrangell, on a small island in the middle of what is today Wrangell Harbor.  The stockade, named Redoubt Saint Dionysius (''\u0420\u0435\u0434\u0443\u0442\u044a \u0421\u0430\u043d\u043a\u0442\u044a \u0414\u0438\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0441\u0456\u0443\u0441\u044a''), was founded at the location of present-day Wrangell and stood near the end of the small peninsula that forms the northeastern side of the mouth of the harbor.\n\nThe British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] (HBC) leased the fort in 1839 and named the stockade [[Fort Stikine]]. The Tlingit had used the [[Stikine River]] as a trade route to the interior since ancient times, and they protested when the Hudson's Bay Company began to use their trade routes.  Two [[epidemic]]s of [[smallpox]] in 1836 and 1840 sharply reduced the Tlingit population in the area by half, as they had no acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], and silenced most of the protest.\n\nThe HBC abandoned the fort in 1849 after the area's stocks of [[sea otter]] and [[American Beaver|beaver]] were depleted, ending the fur trade.  Fort Stikine remained under British rule until Alaska's [[Alaska Purchase|purchase]] by the United States in 1867.\n\n[[File:Wrangell, Alaska by LaRoche, c1897.jpg|thumb|right|Bird's Eye view, 1897]]\nIn 1868, the U.S. built a military post called '''Fort Wrangell''' at the site, and it remained active until 1877. The community around the post continued to grow through commerce with prospectors in the [[gold rush]]es of 1861, 1874&ndash;77, and 1897.  As in [[Skagway, Alaska|Skagway]], businessmen looking to make money off the miners built many gambling halls, dance halls, and bars. Thousands of miners traveled up the Stikine River into the [[Cassiar, British Columbia|Cassiar District]] of [[British Columbia]] during 1874, and again to the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] in 1897.\n\nThe [[Wrangell Bombardment]] occurred on the 25th of December 1869 when a [[Stikine people|Stikine Indian]] named Lowan bit off Mrs. Jaboc Muller's third right finger, and was killed in an ensuing fight by soldiers who mortally wounded an additional Stikine Indian. The following morning, Scutd-doo, who was the father of the deceased, entered the fort and shot the post trader's partner [[Leon Smith (naval commander)|Leon Smith]] fourteen times. Smith died some 13 hours later. The US army made an ultimatum demanding Sccutd-doo's surrender, and following bombardment of the Stikine Indian village, the villagers handed Scutd-doo over to the military in the fort, where he was court-martialed and publicly hanged before the garrison and assembled natives on 29 December,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=FXeNAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA53&lpg=PA53&dq=%22leon+smith%22+1869&source=bl&ots=6ZsKuM3Knw&sig=3Gz5QhHJfXcRs5GjV-Yo54ltITs&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjs9f29w-XVAhUCuBoKHWEkDQQ4ChDoAQhEMAo#v=onepage&q=%22leon%20smith%22%201869&f=false The Aleut Internments of World War II: Islanders Removed from Their Homes by the United States], Russell W.

Reverend [[S. Hall Young]], a colleague of [[Sheldon Jackson]], was assigned to the Wrangell mission and arrived on July 10, 1878.<ref>Young, S. Hall. 1927. ''Hall Young of Alaska''. Fleming Revell.</ref> He worked among both miners and Tlingits.  He established the Fort Wrangell Tlingit Industrial School to teach young Tlingit men various American trades, such as printing, boatbuilding, and construction. This institution was a parallel to Sheldon Jackson's Sitka Industrial Training School, which became [[Sheldon Jackson College]]. Young's school was the nucleus of the later [[Wrangell Institute]], a [[Indian boarding school|boarding school]] for [[Alaska Natives]] through the mid-20th century.\n\nS. Hall Young was a friend and companion of the [[naturalist]] [[John Muir]], who lived in Wrangell in 1879\u20131880.<ref>Muir, John. 1909. ''[[Stickeen: An Adventure with a Dog and a Glacier]]''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.</ref><ref>Muir, John. 1915. ''Travels in Alaska''. Boston: Houghton Mifflin.</ref> Muir and Young traveled up the Stikine River, as well as to [[Kake, Alaska|Kake]], [[Glacier Bay]], and elsewhere in Southeast Alaska. Young and Muir were accompanied by two Stikine elite men, ''T\u02bcaawyaat'' (\"Toyatte\", lit. Long Feather), and ''Kaadaashaan'' (\"Kadachan\"), as well Sitka Charley, as a young man who was their interpreter in [[Chinook Jargon]] and [[English language|English]].\n\nThe oldest Catholic Church in Alaska; St. Rose of Lima, was established at Wrangell May 4, 1879.\n\nHaving been Tlingit territory and then under the jurisdiction of Russia, Great Britain, and the United States, Wrangell has the unique status as the only Alaskan city to have been governed under four \"flags\".\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Scow loaded with salmon at the Alaska Packers Association cannery, Wrangell, Alaska, 1918 (COBB 114).jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Scow loaded with salmon at the Alaska Packers Association cannery in Wrangell, 1918]]\n[[Fish traps]] were constructed in the late 1890s on the nearby mouth of the [[Stikine River]] and in the [[Zimovia Strait]]. These contributed to the growth of the fishing and fish canning industries in Wrangell, which provided much of the economic life for the town before the rise of logging in the 1950s. The fish traps caused severe damage to the [[Stikine River]] salmon runs, reducing the number of fish that managed to spawn and causing a decline in salmon runs and fishing in the region.  After statehood, the new government decommissioned all fish traps in Alaska. The fishing industry remained strong, and continues to be the primary occupation of many residents.\n\nThe weekly [[newspaper]], ''[[The Wrangell Sentinel]]'', was founded in 1902, and printed its first issue on November 2 of that year. The newspaper remains in publication with only a few short periods of inactivity.  It is the oldest continuously published newspaper in Alaska.\n\n[[File:Scowload of salmon at cannery dock, Wrangell, Alaska, August 1918 (COBB 116).jpeg|thumb|Scow with salmon is unloaded at a cannery's dock in Wrangell, 1918]]\nThe renowned [[Bear Totem Store]], built in the 1920s by [[Walter Waters]], housed innumerable examples of Tlingit arts and crafts, as well as a number of irreplaceable [[totem pole]]s.  Waters began his business career carrying mail by boat from Wrangell to Sulzer.  During this period, he traveled throughout southeast Alaska as a fur buyer.  While on business travels, Waters began to acquire Indian artifacts and make valuable contacts with Indian artisans. He eventually enabled him to open his curio shop, The Bear Totem Store.\n\nA severe fire in the early 1950s burned much of the downtown area, destroying the Bear Totem Store and most of its contents. Few historic buildings remained after the fire. The disaster dramatically changed the face of Wrangell, and with new buildings, the past was lost.\n\nLogging, fishing and tourism are the current mainstays of the Wrangell area economy. One of the last two major sawmills in southeast Alaska is operated by the Silver Bay Logging Company just south of the city proper.\n\nThe community has always been a center of the Tlingit ''Kaach.\u00e0di'', ''Kiks.\u00e1di'' and ''Naanyaa.aay\u00ed'' clans, as well as the only home of the ''Kayaashkiditaan'', ''S\u02bciknax\u0331.\u00e1di'', ''X\u0331ook\u02bceid\u00ed'', ''Kaasx\u0331\u02bcagweid\u00ed'', and ''Taal\u1e35weid\u00ed'' clans.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = Traditional Tlingit Map and Tribal List\n| publisher = Tlingit Readers, Inc.\n| url = http://www.ankn.uaf.edu/ANCR/Southeast/TlingitMap/\n| accessdate = 2009-06-21\n}}</ref> [[Chief Shakes]] Tribal House, which is known in Tlingit as ''Sh\u00e9iksh H\u00eddi'' \"Shakes House\", is a replica of traditional Tlingit houses.

A commercial fishing fleet is harbored in Wrangell and several sports fishing guiding services operate here as well taking tourists and wilderness adventurers to remote locations on the great [[Stikine River]] branching eastward into British Columbia. Boatyards have increased in scale allowing storage and repairs of larger vessels. The city has a picturesque golf course with a view of Mt. Wrangell. Like many S.E. Alaskan communities state government spending is important to the local economy, though not to the extent of Juneau-the state capitol. The Federal government also kicks in a share with the forest service, postal service and homeland security operations expenditures.\nThe southernmost terminus of the vast Juneau ice field is just north of the Stikine with several glaciers flowing down to the river and saltwater at [[LeConte Bay]]. Though Chinook salmon have been devastated by commercial over-harvesting recently and the fishery was largely closed in spring 2018, hope for its recovery abounds since fisheries have crashed in S.E. Alaska recurrently over history and recovered.\n\n[[File:Worker preparing crabs for shipment or sale, Wrangell, Alaska, September 3, 1910 (COBB 272).jpeg|thumb|left|Preparing crabs for shipment at Andrew Arneson's place, September 1910]]\nWhales live seasonally in the waters of the Alexander Archipelago<ref>https://www.britannica.com/place/Alexander-Archipelago</ref> and visit Wrangell searching for herring and salmon creating good photo opportunities.

Wrangell has three marinas on the northwest side of the island and the southernmost; Shoemaker Bay, is undergoing renewal construction in September 2018.\n\n[[File:Machine for tarring gillnets, Wrangell, Alaska, August 1918 (COBB 115).jpeg|thumb|upright|F.W. cannery tanks and equipment for tarring gillnets in Wrangell, 1918]]\nA Tlingit cultural center and museum is located on the waterfront of Wrangell. In order to keep a small-town rural aesthetic the city turned down the prospect of building a state prison and home-porting a naval vessel. The Stikine Inn was remodeled to fine shape, and an inter-island ferry business was established with service to Prince of Whales Island. Sunrise aviation- an air work and tourism float plane service, continues to provide service anywhere in the region, though helicopter journeys to high mountain glaciers need to be scheduled from Ketchikan to the south 100 miles (Ketchikan is from the Tlingit word Kootchikan meaning place of stinky fish).\n\nBaron Von Wrangell sent Lieutenant Dionysius Zarembo to establish a trading post on Stikine Strait in 1833 to beat the Brits. Tlingits apparently were receptive to British and Russian traders. Today nearby Zarembo island has an elk and moose population visited by hunting guides and parties from Wrangell.\n\nA marijuana sales business was placed in the back of a restaurant downtown. Alaska Airlines creates a few local jobs with twice daily service to Seattle and Juneau, Ketchikan, Sitka and other S.E. destinations and the Alaska Marine Highway system has a terminal with a few workers where dock ferryboats, near the Stikine Inn. Wrangell's seafood processing plant, though small and consuming much of the city's water supply seasonally, has employed workers from Mexico, Russia and Somalia in recent years.\n[[File:Stikine_River_Delta.jpg|thumb|left|Stikine River Delta]]\nWrangell has several churches and bars and a pizza store though no citywide free wireless internet for tourists or business travelers yet.

Alaska. It is possible to follow the historic route in kayaks to the Stikine River Delta where the orphan warrior Chief Gush X'een and his band of Tlingits defeated boatloads of invading Nisga'a warriors from the south. Rather than becoming a slave the defeated Nisga'a Chief surrendered his hat and title of ''[[Shakes (Tlingit leaders)|Shakes]]'' to Gush X'een.\n\nThe former mill site of the Alaska Pulp Corporation that was dismantled has some use sending logs and boulders via ships and a prospect for development as a cruise ship site with multipurpose western theme shops and dark ale brewery for export. The city has expanded its electrical power lines a mile and a half south on Isheyami Drive to allow a concrete production facility to power up (they bring in sand via barge from the Stikine River).\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1880= 106\n|1890= 316\n|1900= 868\n|1910= 743\n|1920= 821\n|1930= 948\n|1940= 1162\n|1950= 1263\n|1960= 1315\n|1970= 2029\n|1980= 2184\n|1990= 2479\n|2000= 2308\n|2010= 2369\n|estyear=2019\n|estimate=2502\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=June 4, 2019}}</ref>\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref name=\"DecennialCensus\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html|title=Census of Population and Housing|publisher=Census.gov|accessdate=June 4, 2015}}</ref>\n}}\nWrangell first appeared as an unincorporated village on the 1880 U.S. Census.

His father played defensive end for BYU in the 1950s, while Bronco himself played safety for Oregon State where he was named [[Captain (sports)|team captain]] his senior season. His brother [[Mat Mendenhall]] started at defensive end for the Super Bowl Champion [[Washington Redskins]] in [[Super Bowl XVII]].\n\n==Early coaching career==\nMendenhall graduated from [[American Fork High School]] in 1984. In 1990, he served as a graduate assistant coach at [[Oregon State University]] in [[Corvallis, Oregon]]. From 1991 to 1993, he was the defensive coordinator for [[Snow College]], a junior college in [[Ephraim, Utah]]. From 1993 to 1994, he was the defensive coordinator for [[Northern Arizona University]]. From 1995 to 1996, he served as the defensive coordinator for Oregon State. After the 1996 season, he was fired from Oregon State. In 1997, he served as the secondary coach at [[Louisiana Tech]]. From 1998 to 2002, he was the defensive coordinator for the [[University of New Mexico]], where he and head coach [[Rocky Long]] developed a blitz-happy 3-3-5 defensive scheme that produced NFL first-round draft pick [[Brian Urlacher]], who played in New Mexico's \"Loboback\" position, a cross between a linebacker and safety.\n\n==BYU==\n\n===Defensive coordinator===\nIn 2003 Bronco Mendenhall accepted the defensive coordinator position at [[Brigham Young University Cougars football|BYU]] under then head coach [[Gary Crowton]]. Crowton resigned at the end of the 2004 season which was his 3rd consecutive losing season.  The BYU head coach position was first offered to former Cougar linebacker and then Utah defensive coordinator [[Kyle Whittingham]] which resulted in Mendenhall calling UNLV head coach Mike Sanford about the defensive coordinator opening at UNLV. Mendenhall and his wife, Holly, were prepared to tell their sons about the move to UNLV when Whittingham rejected the offer from BYU and accepted the head coaching job at Utah as [[Urban Meyer]]'s replacement. BYU players had been upset that Mendenhall had not been offered the job.  In response, BYU athletic director [[Tom Holmoe]] interviewed Mendenhall first in the re-opened search. Two weeks later, Mendenhall was named BYU's head coach.\n\n===Head coach===\n\n====2005 season====\nIn 2005, his first year at the helm, the Cougars finished the regular season with a 6\u20136 record. Mendenhall switched back to the traditional uniforms with the Y logo on the helmets, which were worn by the most successful BYU teams. Quarterback [[John Beck (American football)|John Beck]], tight end Jonny Harline and running back [[Curtis Brown (running back, born 1984)|Curtis Brown]] led an offensive attack that was BYU's most potent since 2001, averaging 33.0 points per game (second in the MWC and 24th in the nation) and 462.4 yards of total offense per game. BYU tied for second in the MWC and appeared in the [[Las Vegas Bowl]], their first bowl game since 2001, falling to [[California Golden Bears football|California]], 35\u201328.\n\n====2006 season====\nIn 2006, BYU posted its best record in five seasons. It knocked off 10 straight opponents over the final three months, registered a perfect 6\u20130 home record, and finished 11\u20132. The Cougars tallied a perfect clip against league opponents to win the Mountain West Conference championship, winning on the final play of the game at Utah. They decisively defeated Oregon, 38\u20138, in the Pioneer PureVision Las Vegas Bowl. BYU was ranked in the top-20 in the final Associated Press, ''USA Today,'' and Harris Interactive polls, and finished 15th in the final BCS rankings. Mendenhall was named Mountain West Conference and AFCA Region 5 Coach of the Year.\n\n====2007 season====\nMendenhall and the Cougars repeated as MWC champions in 2007 behind another perfect 8-0 MWC season and 11\u20132 final record.  They finished the season ranked No. 14 in both the Associated Press and USA Today polls, BYU's highest finish in the national polls since 1996. To complement their 16-game conference win streak, the Cougars boasted the nation's longest overall winning streak at 10 games. BYU reached its third consecutive Las Vegas Bowl, again winning in dramatic fashion after blocking UCLA's last second field goal to preserve a 17\u201316 victory. En route, Mendenhall became the first coach in school history to lead the Cougars to two consecutive bowl game victories in his first three years as head coach. A defensive specialist, Mendenhall helped BYU finish as the nation's 10th-ranked defense.\n\n====2008 season====\nIn 2008, BYU finished 10\u20133 overall and 6\u20132 in the MWC to achieve three straight 10-win seasons and become the first teams in Cougar history to go unbeaten at home over three consecutive seasons. BYU earned a spot in the national polls each week during the season, including a ranking as high as No. 7. Mendenhall led BYU to a third-place finish in the MWC at 6\u20132 and yet another bowl berth in Las Vegas where the team lost to Arizona by a score of 31\u201321.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/pac12/post/_/id/949/las-vegas-bowl-arizona-31-byu-21 |title=Las Vegas Bowl: Arizona 31, BYU 21 - Pac-12 Blog- ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2008-12-21 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref> BYU became one of only nine schools nationally to be ranked in the top 25 of the final BCS standings each of the past three seasons, with only five teams winning more games than the Cougars over that same time span. While stressing the need for balance in life, Mendenhall began a string of Academic All-Americans at BYU in 2008 as three Cougars\u2014Matt Bauman, Kellen Fowler and David Oswald\u2014were named ''ESPN the Magazine'' Academic All-Americans, a program record.\n\nJunior wide receiver [[Austin Collie]] was named to six different All-America teams, including first-team All-America from CBSSports.com and second-team from The Associated Press. Collie led the nation in total receiving yards and receiving yards per game. He set the BYU single-season record of 1,538 receiving yards. Future NFL players [[Max Hall]] and [[Dennis Pitta]] were also among the top players in the nation at their respective positions.\n\n====2009 season====\nBYU recorded an 11\u20132 record and 7\u20131 league mark in 2009. Mendenhall's team went 3\u20131 against ranked opponents, including a 14\u201313 season-opening win over No. 3 Oklahoma, a dramatic overtime win over No. 19 Utah and a 44\u201320 season-finale Maaco Bowl Las Vegas victory over No. 16 Oregon State. BYU finished No. 12 in the final 2009 polls earning the distinction of being one of only six programs nationally to be ranked in both final polls for four straight seasons. Individually, senior tight end Dennis Pitta earned Consensus All-America honors while setting the NCAA record for most career receiving yards by a tight end (2,901) and breaking Austin Collie's school record for career receptions (221). Scott Johnson and Matt Bauman gave BYU multiple Academic All-Americans again while future NFL running back Harvey Unga became the school's all-time leading rusher with his third-straight 1,000-yard season.\n\n====2010 season====\nAfter losing BYU's winningest quarterback (Max Hall), all-time leading rusher (Harvey Unga) and consensus All-American tight end (Dennis Pitta), Mendenhall started the 2010 season 2\u20135 after playing six games against eventual bowl-bound teams. Mendenhall fired defensive coordinator Jaime Hill and took over defensive duties as the coordinator, resuming the position he held after originally joining BYU as an assistant coach. The change ignited the Cougar defense and the rest of the squad as BYU bounced back to finish the year winning five of its last six to place third in the MWC and earn the program's sixth-straight bowl invitation. BYU earned a 52\u201324 win over UTEP in the New Mexico Bowl. Junior Bryan Kariya was named an Academic All-American, the only FBS running back to earn the honor.\n\nOn September 1, 2010, BYU also announced that the university's football program would become independent beginning with the 2011 season. Concurrently, BYU signed an eight-year contract with [[ESPN]]. Before the 2011 season, Mendenhall filled the departure of offensive coordinator [[Robert Anae]] by promoting quarterbacks coach [[Brandon Doman]] to offensive coordinator. He also named former Cougar and NFL player [[Kelly Poppinga]] to a permanent position on the defensive staff as outside linebackers coach. A few days later, Mendenhall hired Joe DuPaix as BYU's running backs coach and recruiting coordinator. Finally, he added former BYU and Canadian Football League wide receiver [[Ben Cahoon]] as the wide receivers coach.\n\n====2011 season====\nAt BYU's first-ever Media Day, Mendenhall announced that he had signed a three-year contract extension that would take him through the 2013 season but hinted that coaching BYU may not be his football calling forever. According to Mendenhall, \"BYU wanted to make it longer term than that. I want to be worthy of the position I have and I'm going to give it everything I have for those three (years). I'm not saying I won't go farther than that. I hope that's reported. It's not three and done. But I'm willing to lead the charge through independence, then re-evaluate.\"\n\nEmbarking on its first season playing as an independent, BYU finished the 2011 season, Mendenhall's seventh as head coach, with its fifth 10-win season (10\u20133) in the last six years, seventh straight bowl invitation and third-straight bowl win. The Cougars defeated Tulsa in a 24\u201321 come-from-behind victory in the Armed Forces Bowl and earned a No. 25 final ranking in USA Today Coaches Poll. After another slow start to the season, Riley Nelson was named the starting quarterback after leading Cougars to a 27\u201324 victory vs. Utah State in the fifth game of the year, helping BYU win nine of its last 10 games.\n\n====2012 season====\nIn 2012, BYU had an 8\u20135 season\u2014including a Poinsettia Bowl victory over former Mountain West Conference rival San Diego State\u2014and Holmoe announced Mendenhall had extended his contract through the 2016 season. Said Mendenhall: \"BYU is a special place and this is a special time. I'm excited to build on the success of our program over [the] past eight years, and I think there's much more that we can accomplish at BYU.\"<ref>BYU, Bronco Mendenhall agree to contract extension through 2016 season: http://byucougars.com/m-football/byu-bronco-mendenhall-agree-contract-extension-through-2016-season</ref> Prior to the 2013 season, Mendenhall re-hired [[Robert Anae]] as the offensive coordinator and also turned over the defense to secondary coach [[Nick Howell]].\n\n====2013 season====\nAfter losing defensive star [[Ezekiel Ansah]] as the #5 pick in the [[2013 NFL Draft]], the season started slowly for BYU. A blowout win against #15 Texas that put the football world on notice was sandwiched between disappointing losses at Virginia and against Utah. After adjustments by Mendenhall, the team won 5 games in a row including impressive victories against Boise State and Georgia Tech. In a game against Houston, BYU had 456 yards of offense in the first half alone, and Cody Hoffman became the all-time leading receiver in BYU history while the Cougars set the all-time school mark with 41 first downs in a single game. However, the team's defense was not as strong as usual, and BYU finished 8\u20135 after a loss in its bowl game against Washington.\n\n====2014 season====\nFor the second consecutive year, BYU throttled the #25 [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]] on both sides of the ball and won the game going away, 41\u20137, in front of nearly 100,000 Texas fans at [[Darrell K Royal\u2013Texas Memorial Stadium]]. The team also avenged their loss against Virginia by winning in Provo. Also for the second consecutive year, BYU opened the season on the road in the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]], beating UConn 35\u201310 on their home field. Another 8\u20135 season was in store as BYU lost [[The Old Wagon Wheel]] to Utah State, 20\u201335. Mendenhall and BYU played a memorable first edition of the [[Miami Beach Bowl]] against Memphis, for which star quarterback [[Taysom Hill]] was injured and did not play. The Cougars lost a double-overtime thriller to Memphis and its coach [[Justin Fuente]]. A brawl broke out after the game-ending Memphis interception, in which a Memphis player was seen dangerously swinging his metal helmet as a weapon at a BYU player who was taking on four of the Tigers at once.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObWdKYMFjC0 Miami Beach Bowl Brawl: 4 vs 1! Memphis player uses helmet as weapon!], accessed December 6, 2015</ref>\n\n====2015 season====\nBYU opened the season playing away at [[Lincoln Memorial Stadium]] of Nebraska, coming away with a hard-earned victory against the Cornhuskers, 33\u201328. They followed up the win with an impressive home victory against #20 Boise State, 35\u201324. However, a heartbreaking 23\u201324 loss played in the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] against the #10 UCLA Bruins lingered with the team to the following week, when they were blown out, 0\u201331, at [[Michigan Stadium]] against the Michigan Wolverines. The team would recover though and win 7 of its last 8 regular season games to earn a 9\u20133 record and an eleventh consecutive bowl invitation, all under Mendenhall.\n\nThis season would be Mendenhall's last as the BYU head coach. As he had alluded to in his 2011 contract negotiations, it was soon time for him to move on from BYU and its unique situation, opportunity, and restraints. While his brother and father had played for the Cougars, Bronco himself had played at a public university in a major conference, Oregon State. BYU held a joint press conference with AD [[Tom Holmoe]] and Mendenhall for his departure, in which BYU thanked him for his many successful years as head coach, leaving with the second-most wins in school history at 99. Mendenhall also thanked BYU for the one-of-a-kind opportunity and agreed to coach the team in the [[2015 Las Vegas Bowl]] against #20 Utah.\n\n==Virginia==\n\n===Head coach===\nOn December 4, 2015, Mendenhall was named the head coach of the Virginia Cavaliers, after [[Mike London]] resigned on November 29, 2015.<ref name=\"bronco_uva\"/> Mendenhall had previously turned down the head coaching job at UCLA several years prior to accepting the one at Virginia.<ref>[http://fox13now.com/2015/12/04/former-byu-player-reacts-to-bronco-mendenhalls-departure-says-coach-turned-down-prior-offer-from-ucla/ Former BYU Player reacts to Mendenhall's Departure], accessed December 4, 2015</ref> The hire gained attention across the sports spectrum, as [[Boston Celtics]] president and BYU alumnus [[Danny Ainge]] voiced his congratulations to both Mendenhall and UVA on the hire.<ref>[https://twitter.com/danielrainge/status/672914487154970624 Danny Ainge Congratulates Mendenhall on Twitter], accessed December 4, 2015</ref> The appointment was viewed by many as a surprise, following intense speculation involving [[Mark Richt]], [[Jeff Brohm]], and [[Sonny Dykes]] as candidates,<ref name=\"uva_hire_ap\">{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/f0328a8dedcd4b5c858ef4b9601cd8ec/virginia-hires-byus-mendenhall-be-new-head-coach |title=Virginia hires BYU's Mendenhall to be new head coach |work=Associated Press |date=December 4, 2015 |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"uva_hire_dailypress\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailypress.com/sports/uva/dp-spt-virginia-football-bronco-mendenhall-coach-1205-20151204-story.html |title= Virginia keeps Bronco Mendenhall pursuit a secret, taps him to be Cavaliers' new football coach |first=Norm |last=Wood |publisher=[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]] |date=December 4, 2015 |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}</ref> and drew comparisons with the 2009 hire of [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia's men's basketball]] coach [[Tony Bennett (basketball, born 1969)|Tony Bennett]].<ref name=\"uva_hire_dailyprogress\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/cavalierinsider/ratcliffe-virginia-hits-home-run-with-mendenhall/article_38c73780-9b02-11e5-a6c9-3b56029592d3.html |title=Ratcliffe: Virginia hits home run with Mendenhall |first=Jerry |last=Ratcliffe |publisher=[[The Daily Progress]] |date=December 4, 2015 |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====2016 season====\nGoing into the 2016 season, the Cavaliers had accumulated losing seasons for four consecutive years under London, and a total of eight losing seasons in the previous ten. In the press conference at BYU following the announcement of his departure, Mendenhall made note of the similarities to the Cougars when he took over as head coach, having suffered three losing seasons under [[Gary Crowton]] at that time.<ref name=\"byu_virginia_conference\">{{cite AV media |author=Holmoe, Tom |author-link=Tom Holmoe |author2=Bronco Mendenhall |date=December 4, 2015 |title=\nFootball - Bronco Mendenhall Departure Press Conference |medium=[[YouTube]] |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iqDN_GQeRHY |access-date=December 6, 2015 |time=9:12 |location=[[Provo, Utah]] |publisher=[[BYU Cougars]] |quote=Virginia reminds me a lot of BYU when I was named the head coach here.}}</ref> Things did not go well for the Cavaliers in his first season at UVA however, as the team finished 2&ndash;10, last place in the ACC,<ref>{{cite web|title=2016 Virginia Cavaliers Football Schedule|url=http://www.fbschedules.com/ncaa-16/2016-virginia-cavaliers-football-schedule.php|website=FBSchedules|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref> and he did not coach in a bowl game for the first time in his entire career. This 2\u201310 record matched UVA's record in 2013, which was itself the worst for the program since 1981. Though it was Mendenhall's first season at the helm, it was the program's fifth consecutive losing season.\n\nMendenhall highlighted roster management as an area where the previous staff fell short. \u201cWhat I call succession planning, just the methodical, simple filling of a roster to rebuild and develop, has not been done very well,\u201d Mendenhall said, \u201cand I love doing that part...

Mendenhall's Cavaliers would also win the [[South's Oldest Rivalry]] against North Carolina for the first time since 2009, and later defeat Georgia Tech to claim their 6th win of the season and qualify the team for its first bowl bid since the 2011 [[Peach Bowl]].\n\n====2018 season====\nDespite coming off an improved record and a bowl appearance in 2017, Virginia once again was picked last in the ACC Coastal by ESPN and many college football news services. However, the Cavaliers handily defeated official ACC rivals [[2018 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]], 27\u20133, again won the [[South's Oldest Rivalry]] against North Carolina, 31\u201321, and upended the #16 [[2018 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami Hurricanes]], 16\u201313. However, to end the regular season they dropped two consecutive overtime games to [[2018 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech]] and [[2018 Virginia Tech Hokies football team|Virginia Tech]] (27\u201330, 31\u201334) despite being perceived as outplaying both squads. The team then regrouped and ended things on a dominant high note with a statement win over [[2018 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]], 28\u20130, in the [[2018 Belk Bowl]].<ref>[http://www.espn.com/college-football/recap?gameId=401032077 Perkins, Zaccheaus lead Virginia over South Carolina 28-0], accessed January 10, 2019</ref><ref>[https://www.dailyprogress.com/cavalierinsider/three-things-we-learned-from-virginia-s-belk-bowl-victory/article_0df54f06-0c74-11e9-ad1b-cfcd66f86668.html Three things we learned from Virginia's Belk Bowl victory], accessed January 10, 2019</ref> The lopsided victory was seen as a show of strength for not only Virginia and Mendenhall, but for ACC football's standing relative to SEC teams in the runup before [[2019 College Football Playoff National Championship|Clemson's rout of Alabama]] for the National Championship.<ref>[https://www.independentmail.com/story/sports/college/clemson/2018/12/31/clemson-virginia-football-shutout-acc-bowl-record/2444929002/ Virginia's shutout of South Carolina shuts down ACC ridicule], accessed January 10, 2019</ref>\n\n====2019 season====\nMendenhall's [[2019 Virginia Cavaliers football team|Cavaliers]] improved on the previous year's win total for the third straight year. After opening with a win at [[2019 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pitt]], they proceeded to go undefeated at home, culminating in their first victory over Virginia Tech after fifteen consecutive losses [[Virginia\u2013Virginia Tech football rivalry|in their rivalry]]. The victory capped a 9\u20133 regular season and secured the program's first Coastal Division title and a berth in the [[2019 ACC Championship Game]] and [[2019 Orange Bowl]]. This was the program's first Orange Bowl bid since turning down an invite 68 years earlier (for the [[1952 Orange Bowl]]) and only the third [[New Year's Six]] appearance of any Coastal Division member.{{efn|after Georgia Tech ([[2014 Orange Bowl (December)|in 2014]]) and Miami ([[2017 Orange Bowl|in 2017]])}} It was also the Cavaliers' most prestigious bowl appearance since [[George Welsh

His father played defensive end for BYU in the 1950s, while Bronco himself played safety for Oregon State where he was named [[Captain (sports)|team captain]] his senior season. His brother [[Mat Mendenhall]] started at defensive end for the Super Bowl Champion [[Washington Redskins]] in [[Super Bowl XVII]].\n\n==Early coaching career==\nMendenhall graduated from [[American Fork High School]] in 1984. In 1990, he served as a graduate assistant coach at [[Oregon State University]] in [[Corvallis, Oregon]]. From 1991 to 1993, he was the defensive coordinator for [[Snow College]], a junior college in [[Ephraim, Utah]]. From 1993 to 1994, he was the defensive coordinator for [[Northern Arizona University]]. From 1995 to 1996, he served as the defensive coordinator for Oregon State. After the 1996 season, he was fired from Oregon State. In 1997, he served as the secondary coach at [[Louisiana Tech]]. From 1998 to 2002, he was the defensive coordinator for the [[University of New Mexico]], where he and head coach [[Rocky Long]] developed a blitz-happy 3-3-5 defensive scheme that produced NFL first-round draft pick [[Brian Urlacher]], who played in New Mexico's \"Loboback\" position, a cross between a linebacker and safety.\n\n==BYU==\n\n===Defensive coordinator===\nIn 2003 Bronco Mendenhall accepted the defensive coordinator position at [[Brigham Young University Cougars football|BYU]] under then head coach [[Gary Crowton]]. Crowton resigned at the end of the 2004 season which was his 3rd consecutive losing season.  The BYU head coach position was first offered to former Cougar linebacker and then Utah defensive coordinator [[Kyle Whittingham]] which resulted in Mendenhall calling UNLV head coach Mike Sanford about the defensive coordinator opening at UNLV. Mendenhall and his wife, Holly, were prepared to tell their sons about the move to UNLV when Whittingham rejected the offer from BYU and accepted the head coaching job at Utah as [[Urban Meyer]]'s replacement. BYU players had been upset that Mendenhall had not been offered the job.  In response, BYU athletic director [[Tom Holmoe]] interviewed Mendenhall first in the re-opened search. Two weeks later, Mendenhall was named BYU's head coach.\n\n===Head coach===\n\n====2005 season====\nIn 2005, his first year at the helm, the Cougars finished the regular season with a 6\u20136 record. Mendenhall switched back to the traditional uniforms with the Y logo on the helmets, which were worn by the most successful BYU teams. Quarterback [[John Beck (American football)|John Beck]], tight end Jonny Harline and running back [[Curtis Brown (running back, born 1984)|Curtis Brown]] led an offensive attack that was BYU's most potent since 2001, averaging 33.0 points per game (second in the MWC and 24th in the nation) and 462.4 yards of total offense per game. BYU tied for second in the MWC and appeared in the [[Las Vegas Bowl]], their first bowl game since 2001, falling to [[California Golden Bears football|California]], 35\u201328.\n\n====2006 season====\nIn 2006, BYU posted its best record in five seasons. It knocked off 10 straight opponents over the final three months, registered a perfect 6\u20130 home record, and finished 11\u20132. The Cougars tallied a perfect clip against league opponents to win the Mountain West Conference championship, winning on the final play of the game at Utah. They decisively defeated Oregon, 38\u20138, in the Pioneer PureVision Las Vegas Bowl. BYU was ranked in the top-20 in the final Associated Press, ''USA Today,'' and Harris Interactive polls, and finished 15th in the final BCS rankings. Mendenhall was named Mountain West Conference and AFCA Region 5 Coach of the Year.\n\n====2007 season====\nMendenhall and the Cougars repeated as MWC champions in 2007 behind another perfect 8-0 MWC season and 11\u20132 final record.  They finished the season ranked No. 14 in both the Associated Press and USA Today polls, BYU's highest finish in the national polls since 1996. To complement their 16-game conference win streak, the Cougars boasted the nation's longest overall winning streak at 10 games. BYU reached its third consecutive Las Vegas Bowl, again winning in dramatic fashion after blocking UCLA's last second field goal to preserve a 17\u201316 victory. En route, Mendenhall became the first coach in school history to lead the Cougars to two consecutive bowl game victories in his first three years as head coach. A defensive specialist, Mendenhall helped BYU finish as the nation's 10th-ranked defense.\n\n====2008 season====\nIn 2008, BYU finished 10\u20133 overall and 6\u20132 in the MWC to achieve three straight 10-win seasons and become the first teams in Cougar history to go unbeaten at home over three consecutive seasons. BYU earned a spot in the national polls each week during the season, including a ranking as high as No. 7. Mendenhall led BYU to a third-place finish in the MWC at 6\u20132 and yet another bowl berth in Las Vegas where the team lost to Arizona by a score of 31\u201321.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/pac12/post/_/id/949/las-vegas-bowl-arizona-31-byu-21 |title=Las Vegas Bowl: Arizona 31, BYU 21 - Pac-12 Blog- ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2008-12-21 |accessdate=2015-12-24}}</ref> BYU became one of only nine schools nationally to be ranked in the top 25 of the final BCS standings each of the past three seasons, with only five teams winning more games than the Cougars over that same time span. While stressing the need for balance in life, Mendenhall began a string of Academic All-Americans at BYU in 2008 as three Cougars\u2014Matt Bauman, Kellen Fowler and David Oswald\u2014were named ''ESPN the Magazine'' Academic All-Americans, a program record.\n\nJunior wide receiver [[Austin Collie]] was named to six different All-America teams, including first-team All-America from CBSSports.com and second-team from The Associated Press. Collie led the nation in total receiving yards and receiving yards per game. He set the BYU single-season record of 1,538 receiving yards. Future NFL players [[Max Hall]] and [[Dennis Pitta]] were also among the top players in the nation at their respective positions.\n\n====2009 season====\nBYU recorded an 11\u20132 record and 7\u20131 league mark in 2009. Mendenhall's team went 3\u20131 against ranked opponents, including a 14\u201313 season-opening win over No. 3 Oklahoma, a dramatic overtime win over No. 19 Utah and a 44\u201320 season-finale Maaco Bowl Las Vegas victory over No. 16 Oregon State. BYU finished No. 12 in the final 2009 polls earning the distinction of being one of only six programs nationally to be ranked in both final polls for four straight seasons. Individually, senior tight end Dennis Pitta earned Consensus All-America honors while setting the NCAA record for most career receiving yards by a tight end (2,901) and breaking Austin Collie's school record for career receptions (221). Scott Johnson and Matt Bauman gave BYU multiple Academic All-Americans again while future NFL running back Harvey Unga became the school's all-time leading rusher with his third-straight 1,000-yard season.\n\n====2010 season====\nAfter losing BYU's winningest quarterback (Max Hall), all-time leading rusher (Harvey Unga) and consensus All-American tight end (Dennis Pitta), Mendenhall started the 2010 season 2\u20135 after playing six games against eventual bowl-bound teams. Mendenhall fired defensive coordinator Jaime Hill and took over defensive duties as the coordinator, resuming the position he held after originally joining BYU as an assistant coach. The change ignited the Cougar defense and the rest of the squad as BYU bounced back to finish the year winning five of its last six to place third in the MWC and earn the program's sixth-straight bowl invitation. BYU earned a 52\u201324 win over UTEP in the New Mexico Bowl. Junior Bryan Kariya was named an Academic All-American, the only FBS running back to earn the honor.\n\nOn September 1, 2010, BYU also announced that the university's football program would become independent beginning with the 2011 season. Concurrently, BYU signed an eight-year contract with [[ESPN]]. Before the 2011 season, Mendenhall filled the departure of offensive coordinator [[Robert Anae]] by promoting quarterbacks coach [[Brandon Doman]] to offensive coordinator. He also named former Cougar and NFL player [[Kelly Poppinga]] to a permanent position on the defensive staff as outside linebackers coach. A few days later, Mendenhall hired Joe DuPaix as BYU's running backs coach and recruiting coordinator. Finally, he added former BYU and Canadian Football League wide receiver [[Ben Cahoon]] as the wide receivers coach.\n\n====2011 season====\nAt BYU's first-ever Media Day, Mendenhall announced that he had signed a three-year contract extension that would take him through the 2013 season but hinted that coaching BYU may not be his football calling forever. According to Mendenhall, \"BYU wanted to make it longer term than that. I want to be worthy of the position I have and I'm going to give it everything I have for those three (years). I'm not saying I won't go farther than that. I hope that's reported. It's not three and done. But I'm willing to lead the charge through independence, then re-evaluate.\"\n\nEmbarking on its first season playing as an independent, BYU finished the 2011 season, Mendenhall's seventh as head coach, with its fifth 10-win season (10\u20133) in the last six years, seventh straight bowl invitation and third-straight bowl win. The Cougars defeated Tulsa in a 24\u201321 come-from-behind victory in the Armed Forces Bowl and earned a No. 25 final ranking in USA Today Coaches Poll. After another slow start to the season, Riley Nelson was named the starting quarterback after leading Cougars to a 27\u201324 victory vs. Utah State in the fifth game of the year, helping BYU win nine of its last 10 games.\n\n====2012 season====\nIn 2012, BYU had an 8\u20135 season\u2014including a Poinsettia Bowl victory over former Mountain West Conference rival San Diego State\u2014and Holmoe announced Mendenhall had extended his contract through the 2016 season. Said Mendenhall: \"BYU is a special place and this is a special time. I'm excited to build on the success of our program over [the] past eight years, and I think there's much more that we can accomplish at BYU.\"<ref>BYU, Bronco Mendenhall agree to contract extension through 2016 season: http://byucougars.com/m-football/byu-bronco-mendenhall-agree-contract-extension-through-2016-season</ref> Prior to the 2013 season, Mendenhall re-hired [[Robert Anae]] as the offensive coordinator and also turned over the defense to secondary coach [[Nick Howell]].\n\n====2013 season====\nAfter losing defensive star [[Ezekiel Ansah]] as the #5 pick in the [[2013 NFL Draft]], the season started slowly for BYU. A blowout win against #15 Texas that put the football world on notice was sandwiched between disappointing losses at Virginia and against Utah. After adjustments by Mendenhall, the team won 5 games in a row including impressive victories against Boise State and Georgia Tech. In a game against Houston, BYU had 456 yards of offense in the first half alone, and Cody Hoffman became the all-time leading receiver in BYU history while the Cougars set the all-time school mark with 41 first downs in a single game. However, the team's defense was not as strong as usual, and BYU finished 8\u20135 after a loss in its bowl game against Washington.\n\n====2014 season====\nFor the second consecutive year, BYU throttled the #25 [[Texas Longhorns football|Texas Longhorns]] on both sides of the ball and won the game going away, 41\u20137, in front of nearly 100,000 Texas fans at [[Darrell K Royal\u2013Texas Memorial Stadium]]. The team also avenged their loss against Virginia by winning in Provo. Also for the second consecutive year, BYU opened the season on the road in the [[East Coast of the United States|east coast]], beating UConn 35\u201310 on their home field. Another 8\u20135 season was in store as BYU lost [[The Old Wagon Wheel]] to Utah State, 20\u201335. Mendenhall and BYU played a memorable first edition of the [[Miami Beach Bowl]] against Memphis, for which star quarterback [[Taysom Hill]] was injured and did not play. The Cougars lost a double-overtime thriller to Memphis and its coach [[Justin Fuente]]. A brawl broke out after the game-ending Memphis interception, in which a Memphis player was seen dangerously swinging his metal helmet as a weapon at a BYU player who was taking on four of the Tigers at once.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObWdKYMFjC0 Miami Beach Bowl Brawl: 4 vs 1! Memphis player uses helmet as weapon!], accessed December 6, 2015</ref>\n\n====2015 season====\nBYU opened the season playing away at [[Lincoln Memorial Stadium]] of Nebraska, coming away with a hard-earned victory against the Cornhuskers, 33\u201328. They followed up the win with an impressive home victory against #20 Boise State, 35\u201324. However, a heartbreaking 23\u201324 loss played in the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]] against the #10 UCLA Bruins lingered with the team to the following week, when they were blown out, 0\u201331, at [[Michigan Stadium]] against the Michigan Wolverines. The team would recover though and win 7 of its last 8 regular season games to earn a 9\u20133 record and an eleventh consecutive bowl invitation, all under Mendenhall.\n\nThis season would be Mendenhall's last as the BYU head coach. As he had alluded to in his 2011 contract negotiations, it was soon time for him to move on from BYU and its unique situation, opportunity, and restraints. While his brother and father had played for the Cougars, Bronco himself had played at a public university in a major conference, Oregon State. BYU held a joint press conference with AD [[Tom Holmoe]] and Mendenhall for his departure, in which BYU thanked him for his many successful years as head coach, leaving with the second-most wins in school history at 99. Mendenhall also thanked BYU for the one-of-a-kind opportunity and agreed to coach the team in the [[2015 Las Vegas Bowl]] against #20 Utah.\n\n==Virginia==\n\n===Head coach===\nOn December 4, 2015, Mendenhall was named the head coach of the Virginia Cavaliers, after [[Mike London]] resigned on November 29, 2015.<ref name=\"bronco_uva\"/> Mendenhall had previously turned down the head coaching job at UCLA several years prior to accepting the one at Virginia.<ref>[http://fox13now.com/2015/12/04/former-byu-player-reacts-to-bronco-mendenhalls-departure-says-coach-turned-down-prior-offer-from-ucla/ Former BYU Player reacts to Mendenhall's Departure], accessed December 4, 2015</ref> The hire gained attention across the sports spectrum, as [[Boston Celtics]] president and BYU alumnus [[Danny Ainge]] voiced his congratulations to both Mendenhall and UVA on the hire.<ref>[https://twitter.com/danielrainge/status/672914487154970624 Danny Ainge Congratulates Mendenhall on Twitter], accessed December 4, 2015</ref> The appointment was viewed by many as a surprise, following intense speculation involving [[Mark Richt]], [[Jeff Brohm]], and [[Sonny Dykes]] as candidates,<ref name=\"uva_hire_ap\">{{cite news |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/f0328a8dedcd4b5c858ef4b9601cd8ec/virginia-hires-byus-mendenhall-be-new-head-coach |title=Virginia hires BYU's Mendenhall to be new head coach |work=Associated Press |date=December 4, 2015 |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"uva_hire_dailypress\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailypress.com/sports/uva/dp-spt-virginia-football-bronco-mendenhall-coach-1205-20151204-story.html |title= Virginia keeps Bronco Mendenhall pursuit a secret, taps him to be Cavaliers' new football coach |first=Norm |last=Wood |publisher=[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]] |date=December 4, 2015 |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}</ref> and drew comparisons with the 2009 hire of [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia's men's basketball]] coach [[Tony Bennett (basketball, born 1969)|Tony Bennett]].<ref name=\"uva_hire_dailyprogress\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailyprogress.com/cavalierinsider/ratcliffe-virginia-hits-home-run-with-mendenhall/article_38c73780-9b02-11e5-a6c9-3b56029592d3.html |title=Ratcliffe: Virginia hits home run with Mendenhall |first=Jerry |last=Ratcliffe |publisher=[[The Daily Progress]] |date=December 4, 2015 |accessdate=December 5, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====2016 season====\nGoing into the 2016 season, the Cavaliers had accumulated losing seasons for four consecutive years under London, and a total of eight losing seasons in the previous ten.

This 2\u201310 record matched UVA's record in 2013, which was itself the worst for the program since 1981. Though it was Mendenhall's first season at the helm, it was the program's fifth consecutive losing season.\n\nMendenhall highlighted roster management as an area where the previous staff fell short. \u201cWhat I call succession planning, just the methodical, simple filling of a roster to rebuild and develop, has not been done very well,\u201d Mendenhall said, \u201cand I love doing that part...

Mendenhall's Cavaliers would also win the [[South's Oldest Rivalry]] against North Carolina for the first time since 2009, and later defeat Georgia Tech to claim their 6th win of the season and qualify the team for its first bowl bid since the 2011 [[Peach Bowl]].\n\n====2018 season====\nDespite coming off an improved record and a bowl appearance in 2017, Virginia once again was picked last in the ACC Coastal by ESPN and many college football news services.
