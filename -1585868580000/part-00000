He studied [[mathematics]] and worked with [[Royal Dutch Shell]] and some of its operating units as computer programmer and system designer. Krol's debut consisted of poems published in 1961 in various [[:Category:Dutch literary magazines|Dutch literary magazines]]. In 1962 his first book ''De rokken van Joy Scheepmaker'' was published. Thereafter, he developed a typical writing style consisting of text mingled with abstract thoughts expressed in drawings and mathematical equations.

He was also a professional author of technical literature, nonfiction books, thrillers and a decisive biography of the master forger [[Han van Meegeren]].\n\n== Biography ==\nFrederik H. Kreuger stems from an old Amsterdam family where his maternal grandfather ran a small tobacco factory \"Het Wapen van Spanje\" in the Weteringstraat, in the old town near the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]]. He published a Book<ref>Frederik H. Kreuger: ''De Tweede Gouden Eeuw'', Veen Magazines, Diemen 2007, {{ISBN|978-90-8571-112-4}}</ref> about his grandfather, this tobacco factory and the explosive development of science and technique in the [[Belle \u00c9poque]], the period his grandfather lived.\n\nHe was educated in [[Haarlem]] HBS B (a b\u00e8ta-oriented secondary school), took his [[Engineer's degree]] at the [[Delft University of Technology]] in the Netherlands and received there his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1961. He worked as a high voltage scientist in Sweden, England and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands he was employed by the [[Electrical power industry|electrical industry]] and became later managing director of the ''Nederlandse Kabelfabriek'' in Delft. In 1986 he became a high voltage professor of his [[Alma mater]] in Delft and worked there until 1995.\n\nHe was the [[inventor]] of several constructions for high voltage cable systems and of equipment for the detection of [[partial discharge]]s. Some examples are:\n*balanced detection of partial discharges (P.D.s) (also called Kreuger bridge)\n*discharge standard for partial discharge (P.D.) measurements.\n*the (now usual) [[elastomer]]ic joints in solid H.V. cables (also called bi-manchet)\n*the (now usual) [[elastomer]]ic terminals for solid H.V. cables\n\nHis book ''Partial Discharge Detection''<ref>Frederik H. Kreuger: ''Partial Discharge Detection.'' Butterworth,  London 1989.</ref> was for twenty-five years the leading text book in this field. He has also published books about ''Management and Mismanagement in Research''<ref>Frederik H. Kreuger: ''Management and Mismanagement in Research.'' Alphen aan de Rijn 1972.</ref> and ''Disadvantages of Wind Energy''. His high voltage laboratory in Delft became a centre of knowledge for partial discharge detection and for the study of [[Direct current]] high voltage.\n\nKreuger was also the inventor of a system for gaining [[Solar energy|solar power]] from sea by large floating [[algea]] fields producing [[Algae fuel|biofuel]] (European Patent EP07110895 \u2013 22 June 2007). This project is managed by the Botanical Garden of the Department Biotechnology of the Delft University of Technology; several departments of the University are cooperating herein.\n\nKreuger made a study of his fellow-townsman [[Johannes Vermeer]] and Vermeer's use of the [[Camera Obscura]]. He also published a study about the location where Vermeer might have painted his [[The Little Street (Vermeer)|Little Street (Vermeer)]]. An English translation of this study is present in the Municipal archives of Delft.\n\nKreuger started in 2001 to study the life of the famous Dutch forger [[Han van Meegeren]]. His first book on Van Meegeren was a Dutch novel.<ref>Frederik H. Kreuger: ''Het bedrog: roman naar het opzienbarende leven van de meestervervalser Han van Meegeren'', Quantes Publishers, Rijswijk, 2003.</ref>\n\nIt was translated later on in English as \"The Deception\",<ref>Frederik H. Kreuger: ''The Deception.'' Quantes Publishers, Rijswijk 2005.  {{ISBN|90-5959-031-7}}</ref> also featuring some sketches about the life of Johannes Vermeer. A short biography \"Real life of Van Meegeren\" is found at the end of this novel.\n\nKreuger was in an opportune position to write his biography about Van Meegeren because his native language is Dutch and also because he lived in the Netherlands at the time when Van Meegeren was active. He searched for primary sources \u2013 especially in the Netherlands \u2013 and added in this way to the knowledge gained by [[John Godley, 3rd Baron Kilbracken]],<ref>[[John Godley, 3rd Baron Kilbracken|John R. Godley]]: ''Master Forger. The Story of Han van Meegeren.'' New York 1951 and ''Van Meegeren, Master Forger''. New York: Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, 1967.</ref> who was a pioneer in this field, and to that of Marie Louise Doudart de la Gr\u00e9e, who interviewed Van Meegeren in 1946 and wrote a Dutch biography<ref>{{cite book |first=Marie Louise |last=Doudart de la Gr\u00e9e |title= Geen Standbeeld voor Han van Meegeren|publisher= De Goudvink|location= Antwerpen|year= 1966}}</ref>\nin 1966.\n\nKreuger was fortunate to meet the last living relatives of Han van Meegeren and also the last surviving witness of his arrest, and he discovered an unpublished biography of Van Meegeren's son Jacques, containing new information on the artist's life. Besides he found unknown photographs related to Van Meegeren.\n\nIn addition, he revealed paintings under the artist's own name and he also identified some more fake Old Masters made by Van Meegeren.\n\nIn 2004, he published his findings in Dutch in ''Han van Meegeren, Meestervervalser'',<ref>{{cite book |first=Frederik H. |last=Kreuger |title=Han van Meegeren, meestervervalser |location= Diemen |publisher= Veen Magazines |year= 2004 |isbn= 90-76988-53-6}}</ref> where new facts and newly found works of Van Meegeren were collected.\n\nIn 2006 followed ''De Arrestatie van een Meestervervalser'',<ref>{{cite book |first=Frederik H. |last=Kreuger |title=De Arrestatie van een meestervervalser |publisher= Veen Magazines |location= Diemen |year=2006 |isbn= 978-90-8571-043-1}}</ref> again in Dutch, in which the many reactions on his first biography were incorporated.\n\nThe resulting English biography ''A New Vermeer.

He made a study of Gipsy or [[Romani people|Romani]] music and published a book in Dutch<ref>{{cite book |title=Zigeunermuziek |publisher= Delftse Universitaire Pers |location= Delft |year=1996 |isbn= 90-407-1362-6}}</ref> about the history and perception of Gipsy music.

Kreuger: ''De Tweede Gouden Eeuw'', Veen Magazines, Diemen 2007, {{ISBN|978-90-8571-112-4}}</ref> about his grandfather, this tobacco factory and the explosive development of science and technique in the [[Belle \u00c9poque]], the period his grandfather lived.\n\nHe was educated in [[Haarlem]] HBS B (a b\u00e8ta-oriented secondary school), took his [[Engineer's degree]] at the [[Delft University of Technology]] in the Netherlands and received there his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in 1961. He worked as a high voltage scientist in Sweden, England and the Netherlands. In the Netherlands he was employed by the [[Electrical power industry|electrical industry]] and became later managing director of the ''Nederlandse Kabelfabriek'' in Delft. In 1986 he became a high voltage professor of his [[Alma mater]] in Delft and worked there until 1995.\n\nHe was the [[inventor]] of several constructions for high voltage cable systems and of equipment for the detection of [[partial discharge]]s. Some examples are:\n*balanced detection of partial discharges (P.D.s) (also called Kreuger bridge)\n*discharge standard for partial discharge (P.D.) measurements.\n*the (now usual) [[elastomer]]ic joints in solid H.V. cables (also called bi-manchet)\n*the (now usual) [[elastomer]]ic terminals for solid H.V. cables\n\nHis book ''Partial Discharge Detection''<ref>Frederik H. Kreuger: ''Partial Discharge Detection.'' Butterworth,  London 1989.</ref> was for twenty-five years the leading text book in this field. He has also published books about ''Management and Mismanagement in Research''<ref>Frederik H. Kreuger: ''Management and Mismanagement in Research.'' Alphen aan de Rijn 1972.</ref> and ''Disadvantages of Wind Energy''. His high voltage laboratory in Delft became a centre of knowledge for partial discharge detection and for the study of [[Direct current]] high voltage.\n\nKreuger was also the inventor of a system for gaining [[Solar energy|solar power]] from sea by large floating [[algea]] fields producing [[Algae fuel|biofuel]] (European Patent EP07110895 \u2013 22 June 2007). This project is managed by the Botanical Garden of the Department Biotechnology of the Delft University of Technology; several departments of the University are cooperating herein.\n\nKreuger made a study of his fellow-townsman [[Johannes Vermeer]] and Vermeer's use of the [[Camera Obscura]]. He also published a study about the location where Vermeer might have painted his [[The Little Street (Vermeer)|Little Street (Vermeer)]]. An English translation of this study is present in the Municipal archives of Delft.\n\nKreuger started in 2001 to study the life of the famous Dutch forger [[Han van Meegeren]]. His first book on Van Meegeren was a Dutch novel.<ref>Frederik H. Kreuger: ''Het bedrog: roman naar het opzienbarende leven van de meestervervalser Han van Meegeren'', Quantes Publishers, Rijswijk, 2003.</ref>\n\nIt was translated later on in English as \"The Deception\",<ref>Frederik H. Kreuger: ''The Deception.'' Quantes Publishers, Rijswijk 2005.  {{ISBN|90-5959-031-7}}</ref> also featuring some sketches about the life of Johannes Vermeer. A short biography \"Real life of Van Meegeren\" is found at the end of this novel.\n\nKreuger was in an opportune position to write his biography about Van Meegeren because his native language is Dutch and also because he lived in the Netherlands at the time when Van Meegeren was active. He searched for primary sources \u2013 especially in the Netherlands \u2013 and added in this way to the knowledge gained by [[John Godley, 3rd Baron Kilbracken]],<ref>[[John Godley, 3rd Baron Kilbracken|John R. Godley]]: ''Master Forger. The Story of Han van Meegeren.'' New York 1951 and ''Van Meegeren, Master Forger''. New York: Charles Scribner\u2019s Sons, 1967.</ref> who was a pioneer in this field, and to that of Marie Louise Doudart de la Gr\u00e9e, who interviewed Van Meegeren in 1946 and wrote a Dutch biography<ref>{{cite book |first=Marie Louise |last=Doudart de la Gr\u00e9e |title= Geen Standbeeld voor Han van Meegeren|publisher= De Goudvink|location= Antwerpen|year= 1966}}</ref>\nin 1966.\n\nKreuger was fortunate to meet the last living relatives of Han van Meegeren and also the last surviving witness of his arrest, and he discovered an unpublished biography of Van Meegeren's son Jacques, containing new information on the artist's life. Besides he found unknown photographs related to Van Meegeren.\n\nIn addition, he revealed paintings under the artist's own name and he also identified some more fake Old Masters made by Van Meegeren.\n\nIn 2004, he published his findings in Dutch in ''Han van Meegeren, Meestervervalser'',<ref>{{cite book |first=Frederik H. |last=Kreuger |title=Han van Meegeren, meestervervalser |location= Diemen |publisher= Veen Magazines |year= 2004 |isbn= 90-76988-53-6}}</ref> where new facts and newly found works of Van Meegeren were collected.\n\nIn 2006 followed ''De Arrestatie van een Meestervervalser'',<ref>{{cite book |first=Frederik H. |last=Kreuger |title=De Arrestatie van een meestervervalser |publisher= Veen Magazines |location= Diemen |year=2006 |isbn= 978-90-8571-043-1}}</ref> again in Dutch, in which the many reactions on his first biography were incorporated.\n\nThe resulting English biography ''A New Vermeer.

He made a study of Gipsy or [[Romani people|Romani]] music and published a book in Dutch<ref>{{cite book |title=Zigeunermuziek |publisher= Delftse Universitaire Pers |location= Delft |year=1996 |isbn= 90-407-1362-6}}</ref> about the history and perception of Gipsy music.

After [[World War II]] his family repatriated to the [[Netherlands]].\n\nHe studied mathematics and [[physics]] in Amsterdam and Japanese in Paris.

He became for some time the moving spirit of the Cultural Supplement of [[NRC Handelsblad]]. His range of interests was very broad: he wrote poetry for children, analysed with subtlety human emotions, such as: longing, nostalgia, sexuality, love for cars, love for animals. Indonesian and [[Indo people|Indo]] Eurasian culture and literature as well as the aftermath of colonialism remained a lifelong interest. He has written quite a lot about the visual arts and photography. He advocated a more prominent role of the natural sciences in intellectual discourse and education.\n\nIn the 1950s Kousbroek became friends with [[Willem Frederik Hermans]], a Dutch writer who is considered one of the best Dutch writers of the 20th century. They had many interests in common: the scientific worldview, cars, typewriters, [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], [[Karl Popper]], [[surrealism]], atheism, literature. The friendship ended in the 1970s with a quarrel about the reliability of [[Friedrich Weinreb]]'s memoirs. The correspondence between Hermans, Kousbroek and [[Ethel Portnoy]], who was Kousbroek's wife at the time, has been published under the title ''Machines en emoties'' (2009) (Machines and emotions).<ref>''Machines en emoties. Briefwisseling tussen Willem Frederik Hermans, Rudy Kousbroek en Ethel Portnoy tussen 1955 en 1978, becommentarieerd en ingeleid door Willem Otterspeer'', Amsterdam: De Bezige Bij 2009.</ref>\n\nAnother renowned Dutch writer, [[Gerard Reve]], has also been on friendly terms with Kousbroek. But there remained a gap between the rationalist Kousbroek and the Roman Catholic convert Reve. The latter mocked Kousbroek and his [[rationalism]] in his novel ''Het boek van violet en dood'' (1996) (The book of violet and death).\n\nKousbroek had been married to [[Ethel Portnoy]]. He later married the Irish writer Sarah Hart. He had three children, two with Ethel Portnoy and one with Sarah Hart. His daughter, Hepzibah Kousbroek (1954\u20132009) became a writer. His son Gabri\u00ebl Kousbroek became a professional illustrator. Rudy Kousbroek died aged 80 in [[Leiden]].\n\nHe sometimes used the pen names ''Leopold de Buch'' or ''Fred Coyett''.\n\n== Work ==\nKousbroek started his literary career with two books of poetry: ''Tien variaties op het bestiale'' (1951) (Ten variations on things bestial) and ''De begrafenis van een keerkring'' (1953) (The burial of a tropic). He soon decided that writing essays was his real m\u00e9tier.\n\nWith [[Remco Campert]], a school friend, he founded the magazine ''Braak''<ref>The magazine title ''Braak'' refers to many things, among them (i) the early 20th century essayist [[Menno ter Braak]], (ii) fallow/waste, (iii) to vomit and (iv) to demolish.</ref> in May 1950. The magazine lasted only for two years, but was important for the development of the 'Vijftigers' (Dutch poets of the fifties). In 1972 he was the first to deliver the annual [[Huizinga Lecture]] and its subject was Ethology and the Philosophy of Culture. In 1975 he won the [[P. C. Hooft Award|P.C. Hooft Award]], one of the most prestigious literary awards in the Netherlands. In 1994 he received an honorary degree in philosophy from the [[University of Groningen]] in the Netherlands.\n\nKousbroek's love for animals has inspired several of his books, from ''De aaibaarheidsfactor'' (1969) (Kousbroek coined the term, something like: 'caressability factor') to ''Medereizigers; over de liefde tussen mensen en dieren'' (2009) (Travel companions. On the love between humans and animals).\n\nKousbroek has translated [[Exercises in Style|''Exercices de style'']] by [[Raymond Queneau]] (''Stijloefeningen'', 1978) and wrote an introduction to the Dutch translation of ''Ombres chinoises'' by [[Simon Leys]] (''Chinese schimmen'', 1976; in English: ''Chinese shadows''), a book that encouraged intellectuals in the Western world to revise their image of [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nKousbroek's magnum opus is ''Het Oostindisch kampsyndroom'' (The East Indian Camp Syndrome).<ref>The first edition was published in 1992. The fifth edition of 2005 is extended and more elaborate. The subject is the colonial history of the East Indies and its consequences, but the title alludes also to another meaning of the adjective ''East Indian''. The Dutch saying 'He is East Indian deaf' means: He pretends not to hear.</ref> The book is primarily a polemic with the spokesmen of the (r)emigrated people from the Dutch East Indies after the end of the Dutch colonial period, most notably among them [[Jeroen Brouwers]], who holds the view, mistakenly and implicitly racist according to Kousbroek, that the hardships of the Japanese concentration camps in the East Indies during [[World War II]] are of the same order of atrocity as the hardships of the German concentration camps in Europe. The book contains also reminiscences of Kousbroek's youth in the Dutch East Indies, essays on related literature, and reviews.\n\n==Publications==\n* 1951 \u2013 ''Tien variaties op het bestiale'' (poetry)\n* 1953 \u2013 ''De begrafenis van een keerkring'' (poetry)\n* 1968 \u2013 ''Revolutie in een industriestaat'' (alias: Leopold de Buch)\n* 1969 \u2013 ''de aaibaarheidsfactor''\n* 1969 \u2013 ''Anathema's 1''\n* 1970 \u2013 ''Het avondrood der magi\u00ebrs''\n* 1970 \u2013 ''Anathema's 2''\n* 1970 \u2013 ''Het gemaskerde woord.

He later married the Irish writer Sarah Hart. He had three children, two with Ethel Portnoy and one with Sarah Hart. His daughter, Hepzibah Kousbroek (1954\u20132009) became a writer. His son Gabri\u00ebl Kousbroek became a professional illustrator. Rudy Kousbroek died aged 80 in [[Leiden]].\n\nHe sometimes used the pen names ''Leopold de Buch'' or ''Fred Coyett''.\n\n== Work ==\nKousbroek started his literary career with two books of poetry: ''Tien variaties op het bestiale'' (1951) (Ten variations on things bestial) and ''De begrafenis van een keerkring'' (1953) (The burial of a tropic). He soon decided that writing essays was his real m\u00e9tier.\n\nWith [[Remco Campert]], a school friend, he founded the magazine ''Braak''<ref>The magazine title ''Braak'' refers to many things, among them (i) the early 20th century essayist [[Menno ter Braak]], (ii) fallow/waste, (iii) to vomit and (iv) to demolish.</ref> in May 1950. The magazine lasted only for two years, but was important for the development of the 'Vijftigers' (Dutch poets of the fifties). In 1972 he was the first to deliver the annual [[Huizinga Lecture]] and its subject was Ethology and the Philosophy of Culture. In 1975 he won the [[P. C. Hooft Award|P.C. Hooft Award]], one of the most prestigious literary awards in the Netherlands. In 1994 he received an honorary degree in philosophy from the [[University of Groningen]] in the Netherlands.\n\nKousbroek's love for animals has inspired several of his books, from ''De aaibaarheidsfactor'' (1969) (Kousbroek coined the term, something like: 'caressability factor') to ''Medereizigers; over de liefde tussen mensen en dieren'' (2009) (Travel companions. On the love between humans and animals).\n\nKousbroek has translated [[Exercises in Style|''Exercices de style'']] by [[Raymond Queneau]] (''Stijloefeningen'', 1978) and wrote an introduction to the Dutch translation of ''Ombres chinoises'' by [[Simon Leys]] (''Chinese schimmen'', 1976; in English: ''Chinese shadows''), a book that encouraged intellectuals in the Western world to revise their image of [[Mao Zedong]] and the [[Cultural Revolution]].\n\nKousbroek's magnum opus is ''Het Oostindisch kampsyndroom'' (The East Indian Camp Syndrome).<ref>The first edition was published in 1992. The fifth edition of 2005 is extended and more elaborate. The subject is the colonial history of the East Indies and its consequences, but the title alludes also to another meaning of the adjective ''East Indian''. The Dutch saying 'He is East Indian deaf' means: He pretends not to hear.</ref> The book is primarily a polemic with the spokesmen of the (r)emigrated people from the Dutch East Indies after the end of the Dutch colonial period, most notably among them [[Jeroen Brouwers]], who holds the view, mistakenly and implicitly racist according to Kousbroek, that the hardships of the Japanese concentration camps in the East Indies during [[World War II]] are of the same order of atrocity as the hardships of the German concentration camps in Europe. The book contains also reminiscences of Kousbroek's youth in the Dutch East Indies, essays on related literature, and reviews.\n\n==Publications==\n* 1951 \u2013 ''Tien variaties op het bestiale'' (poetry)\n* 1953 \u2013 ''De begrafenis van een keerkring'' (poetry)\n* 1968 \u2013 ''Revolutie in een industriestaat'' (alias: Leopold de Buch)\n* 1969 \u2013 ''de aaibaarheidsfactor''\n* 1969 \u2013 ''Anathema's 1''\n* 1970 \u2013 ''Het avondrood der magi\u00ebrs''\n* 1970 \u2013 ''Anathema's 2''\n* 1970 \u2013 ''Het gemaskerde woord.

He rose to prominence in the early 1970s writing <!--vormvast-->poetry that sharply contrasted with the free-form poetry of his contemporaries. He acquired a reputation for his prose in the late 1970s, writing acerbic essays and columns often critical of writers, television programs, and politicians. As a literary critic and especially as an anthologist he had a formative influence on Dutch literature: his 1979 anthology of Dutch poetry of the 19th and 20th centuries reformed the canon, and was followed by anthologies of Dutch poetry of the 17th and 18th centuries, of [[Afrikaans]] poetry, and of children's poetry. Those anthologies and a steady stream of prose and poetry publications solidified his reputation as one of the country's leading writers and critics; he was awarded the highest literary awards including the [[P. C. Hooft Award]] (1993), and from 2000 to 2004 he was the Dutch [[Dichter des Vaderlands]] ([[Poet Laureate]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netherlands.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=202 |title=Gerrit Komrij |last=Daan |first=Tatjana |date=18 July 2007 |work=[[Poetry International Web|Poetry International]] |accessdate=5 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721162746/http://netherlands.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=202 |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref> Komrij died in 2012 at age 68.<ref>[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/07/writer_gerrit_komrij_dies_afte/ Writer Gerrit Komrij dies after a long illness]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nGerrit Jan Komrij was born on 30 March 1944 in the eastern Dutch town of [[Winterswijk]], [[Gelderland]].

The first was in reconstructing song texts to Dutch songs by [[Jacob Obrecht]] (2005). The second was in lyrics for the chamber choral cycle ''De Seven Zonden van Jeroen Bosch'' (''The Seven Sins of Hieronymus Bosch'') set to largely anonymous 16th Century tunes (2009). The theme of the Seven Sins follows the depiction in ''[[The Seven Deadly Sins and the Four Last Things]]'' a painting [[Hieronymus Bosch]] completed in 1485.\n\n==Prose==\nBesides being a critic of poetry and culture in general, Komrij wrote several semi-autobiographical works, including ''Verwoest Arcadi\u00eb'' ('Arcadia Demolished', 1980) and ''Demonen'' ('Demons', 2003). He also authored several novels, ''Over de bergen'' ('Over the Mountains'), ''Dubbelster'' ('Double Star') and ''De klopgeest'' ('Poltergeist').\n\n==Books about books, anthologies==\nKomrij was a collector of rare and absurd books (a hobby he shared with Boudewijn B\u00fcch<ref name=\"irrt\"/>), and has written extensively about them. Old [[homosexuality|homosexual]] literature, quaint 18th and 19th century poets, and ancient literature about farting are some of his more remarkable subjects. His articles and essays were collected in books such as like ''Verzonken boeken'' ('Sunk Books'), ''Averechts'' ('The Other Way') and ''Kakafonie'' ('Cacaphonia')--the latter subtitled ''An Encyclopedia of Shit''. In 1979 Komrij published a new standard Dutch poetry [[anthology]], ''[[De Nederlandse po\u00ebzie van de 19de en 20ste eeuw in 1000 en enige gedichten]]'' (\"Dutch poetry of the 19th and 20th century in 1000 and some poems'), which quickly became the yardstick by which poets were measured. It was soon followed by a volume of 17th and 18th century poetry, an anthology of South African poets, and an anthology of medieval poems. He also edited various other anthologies, one about mothers and one selecting poetry by [[Jacob Isra\u00ebl de Haan]].\n\nKomrij has translated from many different languages, including all of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare's]] plays.\n\n==Awards==\n[[File:De schoolverlater - Komrij - Leiden.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Komrij's \"Schoolverlater\" displayed in [[Leiden]].]]\nHis prose was recognized in 1979 when he was awarded the Busken Huet award.<ref name=\"kb\">{{cite web\n  | last = \n  | first = \n  | authorlink = \n  | coauthors = \n  | title = Gerrit Komrij: Profiel\n  | work = \n  | publisher = [[Koninklijke Bibliotheek, National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]]\n  | date = \n  | url = http://www.kb.nl/themas/nederlandse-poezie/dichter-des-vaderlands/gerrit-komrij-1944-2012\n  | doi = \n  | accessdate = 2009-01-20}}</ref> In 1993 Komrij received the [[P.C.

He rose to prominence in the early 1970s writing <!--vormvast-->poetry that sharply contrasted with the free-form poetry of his contemporaries. He acquired a reputation for his prose in the late 1970s, writing acerbic essays and columns often critical of writers, television programs, and politicians. As a literary critic and especially as an anthologist he had a formative influence on Dutch literature: his 1979 anthology of Dutch poetry of the 19th and 20th centuries reformed the canon, and was followed by anthologies of Dutch poetry of the 17th and 18th centuries, of [[Afrikaans]] poetry, and of children's poetry. Those anthologies and a steady stream of prose and poetry publications solidified his reputation as one of the country's leading writers and critics; he was awarded the highest literary awards including the [[P. C. Hooft Award]] (1993), and from 2000 to 2004 he was the Dutch [[Dichter des Vaderlands]] ([[Poet Laureate]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://netherlands.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=202 |title=Gerrit Komrij |last=Daan |first=Tatjana |date=18 July 2007 |work=[[Poetry International Web|Poetry International]] |accessdate=5 May 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721162746/http://netherlands.poetryinternationalweb.org/piw_cms/cms/cms_module/index.php?obj_id=202 |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}</ref> Komrij died in 2012 at age 68.<ref>[http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/07/writer_gerrit_komrij_dies_afte/ Writer Gerrit Komrij dies after a long illness]</ref>\n\n==Biography==\nGerrit Jan Komrij was born on 30 March 1944 in the eastern Dutch town of [[Winterswijk]], [[Gelderland]].

It was also announced that the projected cost had increased from $1.6 billion to $2.2 billion.

Prior to construction of the light rail, [[Hillsbus]] and [[State Transit Authority|State Transit]] bus routes using George Street were permanently removed from the street. The network will be further redesigned when the light rail opens in 2020. Some bus routes from the Eastern Suburbs will be removed from the CBD, with many of the routes integrated with the light rail interchanges at Randwick and Kingsford. Some passengers will be required to change from bus to light rail to complete their journey.\n\nTo accommodate construction of the light rail on George Street, new bus timetables were introduced on 4 October 2015. Buses were diverted from George Street on to other streets in the CBD, including [[Elizabeth Street, Sydney|Elizabeth]], [[Castlereagh Street, Sydney|Castlereagh]], [[Park Street, Sydney|Park]], Druitt, Clarence and [[York Street, Sydney|York]] Streets.<ref name=\"TfNSW28May15\" /> Some routes had their terminus changed to such places as [[Railway Square]], [[Queen Victoria Building]] and [[King Street Wharf]].

A number of bus routes using Anzac Parade would unload city bound passengers at the Nine Ways (now Juniors Kingsford) interchange to board the light rail, then continue along Anzac Parade to the [[University of New South Wales]] to unload passengers before terminating in Todman Avenue, Kensington. Some bus routes that were currently operating to the city via Randwick would become feeder services that drop off city bound passengers at the light rail terminus.\n\nThe proposed changes for the Eastern Suburbs bus routes as per the EIS were as follows:<ref name=\"EISVol2128132\" />\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\"\n!colspan=\"4\"| Proposed Eastern Suburbs bus route changes\n|-\n!colspan=\"4\" style=\"background-color:#FFFFFF\"| Route buses\n|-\n!

Initially, an overhead concourse was proposed for access to the stop during special events with at-grade access at other times.

The bridge was to be connected to the concourse.<ref name=\"sub rep chap 6\"/> In December 2014, the overhead concourse was removed, with underground access for major events provided at both ends of the platform. At-grade access will be used by disabled passengers during major events and by all passengers at other times. The bridge will now be a separate structure.

The manuscript in question was rejected by his publisher, Willem Donker, as being \"too gruesome\".

Nevertheless, the investigation yielded no concrete evidence against the writer.\n\nIn 1997 Klinkhamer sold the residence he had shared with his wife and moved to [[Amsterdam]]. In 2000 the new occupants of Klinkhamer's former home started renovation on the garden, and work crews discovered the skeletal remains of his wife in clay beneath a concrete floor in the garden shed.

It was produced by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]]. It is notable as Australia's first locally produced science fiction television series and one of the first Australian TV series to be sold overseas.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51775573 |title=KIDS!\u2014 You can't fool them. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=29 April 1964 |accessdate=9 March 2014 |page=15 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nA schoolmaster finds an unconscious young man on his doorstep, takes him in and looks after him. A firm friendship develops between the stranger and the headmaster's children Bernard and Jean and their friend Peter, leading them to discover the stranger's secret: that he is from another planet and has been sent to find a new home on Earth for his people. The stranger, Adam, is joined by fellow alien Varossa. They live in a society without books where they memorise everything. In the second series the children have to enlist the help of the Australian Prime Minister when Peter is kidnapped by the alien, and a procession of intrigues eventually leads them to the aliens' home planet of Soshuniss.\n\n==Production==\n''The Stranger'' was written by New Zealand-born author [[G K Saunders|G.K. Saunders]], produced by [[Storry Walton]] and directed by [[Gil Brealey]], with production design by [[Geoffrey Wedlock]]. Two series of six episodes each were produced in 1964 and 1965. It was a major hit in Australia and was sold to the [[BBC]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Harrison |first=Tony |date=1994 |title=The Australian Film and Television Companion |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=v67oAAAACAAJ |location=Cammeray |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster|Simon & Schuster Australia]] |page=324 |isbn=0731804554 |author-link= |access-date=1 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe series starred leading stage and radio actor [[Ron Haddrick]] as \"The Stranger\", Adam Suisse; the children were played by Janice Dinnen and Bill Levis as Jean and Bernard (Bernie) Walsh and Michael Thomas as their friend Peter Cannon. The supporting cast included [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0264404/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 John Faassen] as Mr Walsh and [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633415/bio Jessica Noad] as Mrs Walsh, [[Owen Weingott]] as Professor Mayer, [[Chips Rafferty]] as the Prime Minister, [[Reg Livermore]] as Varossa and Mary Mackay as the female Soshun and [[Ben Gabriel]] as the male Soshun. Other actors include [[Ronne Arnold]] (Dr Kamutsa - UN), Henry Gilbert (Hutchins - UN), Bernie Baia (Dr Matoula - UN), Bill Levey, Ivor Bromley as Colonel Nash, and British actor [[Grant Taylor (actor)|Grant Taylor]] as Detective Inspector Chisholm and Jeffrey Hodgson as Detective Howell. \n\nOther minor roles are as follows: [[Robert McDarra]] plays the Squadron Leader, Denys Burrows is the Chief Police Inspector, Keith Buckley is John Robinson, Stewart Ginn is Senator Anderson and [[Patricia Lovell|Nigel Lovell]] plays Group Captain Ponsonby. [[John Fegan (actor)|John Fegan]] ([[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]) and Douglas Morgan play Police officers. Alex Cann plays Rudolph Lindenberger, Dennis Carroll is Edward Mayer, and Don Philps is Wilson. Notable actors playing Soshuniss Elders include [[Max Phipps]] and [[Reg Evans]]. Istosin, the pilot of the guide ship, was played by John Unicomb and the pilot of the saucer later in the series is Scott Taylor. [[Judy Nunn]] plays a minor role in episode 7. The Lord Mayor was played by Gordon Glenwright, the Lady Mayoress by [[Thelma Scott]] and the Town Clerk by Barry Ross.\n\nThe series was also notable for the fact that Saunders devised a special language that the aliens spoke amongst themselves and, like later science fiction series such as ''[[Babylon 5]]'', they spoke English with a \"foreign\" accent; in the story Adam can speak German and French, and this leads to the children's father's initial assumption that he is from Switzerland (whence his surname; Adam comes from Adam and Eve). \n\nThe series was made with cooperation from the [[CSIRO]] with pivotal scenes shot on location at the [[Parkes Observatory]] and the facility's radio telescope featured in the iconic opening title sequence. The CSIRO were also consulted on the design of the alien spacecraft that lands on the steps of the Sydney Town Hall where the aliens are greeted by the Prime Minister, played by veteran Australian screen star [[Chips Rafferty]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-02/abc-iview-to-stream-the-stranger-australian-dr-who/11870424 |title=The Stranger, Australia's answer to Doctor Who, premieres on ABC iview after decades in the vaults |last1=Maguire |first1=Dannielle |last2=Judd |first2=Bridget |date=2 February 2020 |website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |publisher= |access-date=4 February 2020 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the entire series was digitally restored by the ABC and in January 2020 was released on their on demand service [[ABC iview|iview]] and the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpVCdtt1ylI ABC TV & iview YouTube channel].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-02/abc-iview-to-stream-the-stranger-australian-dr-who/11870424 |title=The Stranger, Australia's answer to Doctor Who, premieres on ABC iview after decades in the vaults |last1=Maguire |first1=Dannielle |last2=Judd |first2=Bridget |date=2 February 2020 |website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |publisher= |access-date=4 February 2020 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| color1     = #000000\n| link1      = #Series 1 (1964)\n| episodes1  = 6\n| start1     = {{Start date|1964|4|26|df=y}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1964|5|30|df=y}}\n| network1   = [[ABC Television|Australian Broadcasting Commission]]\n\n| color2     = #A9A9A9\n| link2      = #Series 2 (1965)\n| episodes2  = 6\n| start2     = {{Start date|1965|6|20|df=y}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1965|7|25|df=y}}\n}}\n\n===Series 1 (1964)===\n{{Episode table\n|background = #000000\n||overall = 6 |series = 6 |director = 14 |writer = 18 |airdate = 16 |summary = 20 \n|episodes   =\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| DirectedBy      = [[Gil Brealey]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[G.

The next thing the Mr Walsh has reported the children as missing and the Police say they are just hiding. Mr Walsh receives a letter from Jean, postmarked Venezuela, in which she says she cannot explain what has happened and will return but she is not sure when. The letter was posted the day after they disappeared and took only four days to get to Australia. Meanwhile the children are have been transferred from the flying saucer to another machine, the Mothership. Adam then \"tells the truth\" and tells a story about a planet where people lived but an accident happened that poisoned the planet. When the planet, Soshuniss, was poisoned, clever people went to one moon and survived. One thousand people wandered on the moon for a few centuries looking for a suitable planet.

They all return in the flying saucer and when back home, the children tell their parents about what has happened. They do not believe them. The Police arrive and question the children and the aliens. Suisse advises he does not know how old he is as they have no concept of years. Adam and Varossa are arrested. Mr Walsh contacts Professor Mayer who speaks to the children. He advises that he will make arrangements so that the children can secretly take him to the flying saucer. The next day they take the Professor to the flying saucer (wearing blacked out glasses so he does not know the location).

The RAAF officers fly to Canberra and go to Parliament House to brief the Prime Minister. It is revealed that radar tracked the ships to 130 miles where they were joined by another larger vessel. They then went to 5,600 miles and then 50 to 60,000 miles where they landed on a small moon. The children return and are met by Police and Colonel Nash from \"security\". He questions the children. They tell him Professor Mayer has stayed on the Soshuniss to study them. Bernie advises the Colonel that the Soshunussi want to settle on Earth.

The flying saucer with Peter on board lands on the aliens' moon. The pilot takes him into a room in a cave where the new Soshun is in charge. The old Soshun comes in and talks to Peter. She explains what has happened and that she does not agree with the new Soshun's plan about Earth. This is to invade Earth if need be. She says they have one weapon.

Adam communicates to Jean through a dream which directs her to a post office in Bunyul, a deserted mining town outside Parkes. Jean decides to sneak out of the Parkes compound and find Adam. Meanwhile Peter has been left comatose in the courtyard at Parliament House with a letter from the Soshun. This is taken to the Prime Minister's office while Peter is taken to hospital and then Sydney. Jean locates the post office and inside the postmaster has a letter for her. The letter has a map and instructions that Adam is hiding in a shed at the Bunyula Showground.  Bernie and Edward meet Jean and they locate Adam's hideout. Here the children learn that Varossa was shot and captured by the Police. Adam asks them to bring him the radio which he can use to speak to the \"little ship\", one of which is always waiting nearby. They agree to get it.

The dish is tilted right over so Bernie can step off while Blake is left hanging vertically at the top. Bernie runs away and returns the device to Adam who attempts to contact the Soshun. Mayer and the other children go to Adam too. The flying saucer receives the signal and is heading towards them. Blake is let off the dish and finds Adam. He tape records Mayer explaining that Peter was returned to Earth in a coma with a hostile threat from the Soshun and that the radio telescope is now being used to track Shosuniss so that it can be destroyed. Meyer volunteers to visit Soshuniss to act as a human shield in case of an attack from Earth. Adam also reveals that only a Soshunite scientist can bring Peter out of his coma. Blake goes back to Lindenberger with the tape recording. Lindenberger reveals that he had planned to take all the Soshunites to an island and when the moon was destroyed by the nuclear missiles, no-one would have known that they were on Earth. He says Mayer would also have been rich if he had played along. He decides to frame Mayer and make him appear to be a traitor. He also intends for Blake to kidnap Adam before Nash arrives at the hideout and arrests Mayer and the children. Lindenberger plays the tape to Nash. Adam reveals to Mayer that they have a secret weapon of some sort. As the Soshunite craft is landing, the henchman and Blake arrive and kidnap Adam. However, Adam hypnotises them and retrieves the radio from them. Mayer attempts to board the flying saucer but gets shot by Colonel Nash. The flying saucer takes off without Adam or Mayer.\n| LineColor       = A9A9A9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 12\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 6\n| DirectedBy      = [[Gil Brealey]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[G.

Mr Walsh sneaks away and arrives in Canberra demanding a meeting with the Prime Minister advising that the weapon that the Soshunites have is their moon. They intend to smash it into Earth if they are not given a place to live. Adam contacts the Soshun again and tells them to destroy the radio telescope. The Soshunites use radio or sound waves to damage the radio telescope and prevent it from tracking Soshuniss. Adam and Dr Kamutsa, a representative of the Secretary-General of the UN and some others meet with the Prime Minister. The UN has delegated the role to negotiate to the PM. Adam uses the radio to speak to the Soshun and pass on the PM's request for a representative to visit the Soshun to discuss \"a peaceful and harmonious end to this squabble\". The Soshun advises he will negotiate only with the children, Jean, Bernie and Edward. The PM agrees to send the children with Dr Kamutsa to Sushuniss and tells Nash to make sure that the media know nothing of this till it is over. Adam advises that the children will be picked up from the radio telescope  and the UN representative from Canberra. The children talk to the Soshun and Jean demands that first the Sushun must bring Peter out of his coma. He agrees to send a body healing scientist to Earth to fix Peter. Lindenberger offers the PM his private island as a settlement location for the Soshunites for his own gain, but is out-manoeuvred by the Prime Minister, forced to relinquish control of the island. A settlement agreement is finally reached but this is not shown. It is revealed by Adam that the moon could not have been crashed into the Earth successfully as it would have been smashed into small pieces when it came close and it could never have left as it does not have enough energy to pull away from the Earth's gravity. The following day Varossa and Adam are paraded down George Street to a civic reception held on the steps of Sydney Town Hall. Adam and Varossa arrive and sit with the Lord Mayor, the children and Mr Walsh at the stop of the steps. The flying saucer (the small ship) arrives with the Soshun. The Mayor welcomes the Soshunites to Sydney and Earth. Adam and Varossa climb into the flying saucer and take off, passing over the uncompleted Sydney Opera House. The Soshun stays behind.\n| LineColor       = A9A9A9\n}}\n}}\n\n==Adaptation==\nOver a decade after the series was produced, Saunders wrote a book adaptation which was published by [[Whitcoulls|Whitcombe & Tombs]] in 1978.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1293444 |title=The stranger / [by] G.K.

It was produced by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|Australian Broadcasting Commission]]. It is notable as Australia's first locally produced science fiction television series and one of the first Australian TV series to be sold overseas.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article51775573 |title=KIDS!\u2014 You can't fool them. |newspaper=[[The Australian Women's Weekly]] | date=29 April 1964 |accessdate=9 March 2014 |page=15 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\n\nA schoolmaster finds an unconscious young man on his doorstep, takes him in and looks after him. A firm friendship develops between the stranger and the headmaster's children Bernard and Jean and their friend Peter, leading them to discover the stranger's secret: that he is from another planet and has been sent to find a new home on Earth for his people. The stranger, Adam, is joined by fellow alien Varossa. They live in a society without books where they memorise everything. In the second series the children have to enlist the help of the Australian Prime Minister when Peter is kidnapped by the alien, and a procession of intrigues eventually leads them to the aliens' home planet of Soshuniss.\n\n==Production==\n''The Stranger'' was written by New Zealand-born author [[G K Saunders|G.K. Saunders]], produced by [[Storry Walton]] and directed by [[Gil Brealey]], with production design by [[Geoffrey Wedlock]]. Two series of six episodes each were produced in 1964 and 1965. It was a major hit in Australia and was sold to the [[BBC]].<ref>{{Cite book |last=Harrison |first=Tony |date=1994 |title=The Australian Film and Television Companion |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=v67oAAAACAAJ |location=Cammeray |publisher=[[Simon & Schuster|Simon & Schuster Australia]] |page=324 |isbn=0731804554 |author-link= |access-date=1 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe series starred leading stage and radio actor [[Ron Haddrick]] as \"The Stranger\", Adam Suisse; the children were played by Janice Dinnen and Bill Levis as Jean and Bernard (Bernie) Walsh and Michael Thomas as their friend Peter Cannon. The supporting cast included [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0264404/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1 John Faassen] as Mr Walsh and [https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0633415/bio Jessica Noad] as Mrs Walsh, [[Owen Weingott]] as Professor Mayer, [[Chips Rafferty]] as the Prime Minister, [[Reg Livermore]] as Varossa and Mary Mackay as the female Soshun and [[Ben Gabriel]] as the male Soshun. Other actors include [[Ronne Arnold]] (Dr Kamutsa - UN), Henry Gilbert (Hutchins - UN), Bernie Baia (Dr Matoula - UN), Bill Levey, Ivor Bromley as Colonel Nash, and British actor [[Grant Taylor (actor)|Grant Taylor]] as Detective Inspector Chisholm and Jeffrey Hodgson as Detective Howell. \n\nOther minor roles are as follows: [[Robert McDarra]] plays the Squadron Leader, Denys Burrows is the Chief Police Inspector, Keith Buckley is John Robinson, Stewart Ginn is Senator Anderson and [[Patricia Lovell|Nigel Lovell]] plays Group Captain Ponsonby. [[John Fegan (actor)|John Fegan]] ([[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]) and Douglas Morgan play Police officers. Alex Cann plays Rudolph Lindenberger, Dennis Carroll is Edward Mayer, and Don Philps is Wilson. Notable actors playing Soshuniss Elders include [[Max Phipps]] and [[Reg Evans]]. Istosin, the pilot of the guide ship, was played by John Unicomb and the pilot of the saucer later in the series is Scott Taylor. [[Judy Nunn]] plays a minor role in episode 7. The Lord Mayor was played by Gordon Glenwright, the Lady Mayoress by [[Thelma Scott]] and the Town Clerk by Barry Ross.\n\nThe series was also notable for the fact that Saunders devised a special language that the aliens spoke amongst themselves and, like later science fiction series such as ''[[Babylon 5]]'', they spoke English with a \"foreign\" accent; in the story Adam can speak German and French, and this leads to the children's father's initial assumption that he is from Switzerland (whence his surname; Adam comes from Adam and Eve). \n\nThe series was made with cooperation from the [[CSIRO]] with pivotal scenes shot on location at the [[Parkes Observatory]] and the facility's radio telescope featured in the iconic opening title sequence. The CSIRO were also consulted on the design of the alien spacecraft that lands on the steps of the Sydney Town Hall where the aliens are greeted by the Prime Minister, played by veteran Australian screen star [[Chips Rafferty]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-02/abc-iview-to-stream-the-stranger-australian-dr-who/11870424 |title=The Stranger, Australia's answer to Doctor Who, premieres on ABC iview after decades in the vaults |last1=Maguire |first1=Dannielle |last2=Judd |first2=Bridget |date=2 February 2020 |website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |publisher= |access-date=4 February 2020 |quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019 the entire series was digitally restored by the ABC and in January 2020 was released on their on demand service [[ABC iview|iview]] and the [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpVCdtt1ylI ABC TV & iview YouTube channel].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-02-02/abc-iview-to-stream-the-stranger-australian-dr-who/11870424 |title=The Stranger, Australia's answer to Doctor Who, premieres on ABC iview after decades in the vaults |last1=Maguire |first1=Dannielle |last2=Judd |first2=Bridget |date=2 February 2020 |website=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |publisher= |access-date=4 February 2020 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Series overview\n| color1     = #000000\n| link1      = #Series 1 (1964)\n| episodes1  = 6\n| start1     = {{Start date|1964|4|26|df=y}}\n| end1       = {{End date|1964|5|30|df=y}}\n| network1   = [[ABC Television|Australian Broadcasting Commission]]\n\n| color2     = #A9A9A9\n| link2      = #Series 2 (1965)\n| episodes2  = 6\n| start2     = {{Start date|1965|6|20|df=y}}\n| end2       = {{End date|1965|7|25|df=y}}\n}}\n\n===Series 1 (1964)===\n{{Episode table\n|background = #000000\n||overall = 6 |series = 6 |director = 14 |writer = 18 |airdate = 16 |summary = 20 \n|episodes   =\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| DirectedBy      = [[Gil Brealey]]\n| WrittenBy       = [[G.

Mr Walsh receives a letter from Jean, postmarked Venezuela, in which she says she cannot explain what has happened and will return but she is not sure when. The letter was posted the day after they disappeared and took only four days to get to Australia. Meanwhile the children are have been transferred from the flying saucer to another machine, the Mothership. Adam then \"tells the truth\" and tells a story about a planet where people lived but an accident happened that poisoned the planet.

The Soshun advises he will negotiate only with the children, Jean, Bernie and Edward. The PM agrees to send the children with Dr Kamutsa to Sushuniss and tells Nash to make sure that the media know nothing of this till it is over. Adam advises that the children will be picked up from the radio telescope  and the UN representative from Canberra. The children talk to the Soshun and Jean demands that first the Sushun must bring Peter out of his coma. He agrees to send a body healing scientist to Earth to fix Peter. Lindenberger offers the PM his private island as a settlement location for the Soshunites for his own gain, but is out-manoeuvred by the Prime Minister, forced to relinquish control of the island. A settlement agreement is finally reached but this is not shown. It is revealed by Adam that the moon could not have been crashed into the Earth successfully as it would have been smashed into small pieces when it came close and it could never have left as it does not have enough energy to pull away from the Earth's gravity. The following day Varossa and Adam are paraded down George Street to a civic reception held on the steps of Sydney Town Hall. Adam and Varossa arrive and sit with the Lord Mayor, the children and Mr Walsh at the stop of the steps. The flying saucer (the small ship) arrives with the Soshun. The Mayor welcomes the Soshunites to Sydney and Earth. Adam and Varossa climb into the flying saucer and take off, passing over the uncompleted Sydney Opera House. The Soshun stays behind.\n| LineColor       = A9A9A9\n}}\n}}\n\n==Adaptation==\nOver a decade after the series was produced, Saunders wrote a book adaptation which was published by [[Whitcoulls|Whitcombe & Tombs]] in 1978.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/1293444 |title=The stranger / [by] G.K.
