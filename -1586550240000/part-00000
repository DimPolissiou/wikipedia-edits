The first event happened less than a decade before the publication of Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo works: the Invasion of Mexico or, in USA the [[Mexican- American war|Mexican\u2013American War]], after which Mexico lost a third of its territory. The second event, the [[Walker affair]], happened the same year both works were written: the decision by U.S. president [[Franklin Pierce]] to recognize the regime recently established in Nicaragua by American [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and his band of filibusters who ruled Nicaragua for nearly a year (1856\u201357) and attempted to reinstate slavery there, where it had been already abolished for three decades\n\nIn both Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo's works, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican-American War]] and Walker's expedition to Nicaragua are explicitly mentioned as examples of dangers for the region.  For Bilbao, \"Latin America\" was not a geographical concept, since he excluded Brazil, Paraguay and Mexico.  Both authors also ask for the union of all Latin American countries as the only way to defend their territories against further foreign U.S. interventions. Both rejected also European imperialism, claiming that the return of European countries to non-democratic forms of government was another danger for Latin American countries, and used the same word to describe the state of European politics at the time: \"despotism.\"  Several years later, during the [[French invasion of Mexico]], Bilbao wrote another work, \"Emancipation of the Spirit in America,\" where he asked all Latin American countries to support the Mexican cause against France, and rejected French imperialism in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. He asked Latin American intellectuals to search for their \"intellectual emancipation\" by abandoning all French ideas, claiming that France was: \"Hypocrite, because she [France] calls herself protector of the Latin race just to subject it to her exploitation regime; treacherous, because she speaks of freedom and nationality, when, unable to conquer freedom for herself, she enslaves others instead!\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bilbao |first1=Francisco |title=Emancipaci\u00f3n del esp\u00edritu de Am\u00e9rica |url=http://www.franciscobilbao.cl/1909/article-81905.html |website=Francisco Bilbao Barqu\u00edn, 1823\u20131865, Chile|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> Therefore, as Michel Gobat puts it, the term Latin America itself had an \"anti-imperial genesis,\" and their creators were far from supporting any form of imperialism in the region, or in any other place of the globe.\n\nHowever, in France the term Latin America was used with the opposite intention. It was employed by the French Empire of [[Napoleon III]] during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude [[Anglo America|Anglophone countries]]. It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor of the [[Second Mexican Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Chasteen |first1=John Charles |authorlink1= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |title=Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fC90B5xkYyIC&lpg=PA156&pg=PP1#v=onepage |accessdate=4 July 2010 |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2001 |origyear= |publisher=[[W.

Neither area is culturally or linguistically homogeneous; in substantial portions of Latin America (e.g., highland [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]]), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures and, to a lesser extent, Amerindian languages, are predominant, and in other areas, the influence of African cultures is strong (e.g., the Caribbean basin{{spaced ndash}}including parts of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]).\n\nThe term is not without controversy.  Historian Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo explores at length the \"allure and power\" of the idea of Latin America. He remarks at the outset, \"The idea of 'Latin America' ought to have vanished with the obsolescence of racial theory... But it is not easy to declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed,\" going on to say, \"The term is here to stay, and it is important.\"<ref>Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo, ''Latin America: The Allure and Power of an Idea''.

3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Maya Civilization|Mayan]] archeological site [[Chichen Itza]]. ]]\n\nThe earliest known settlement was identified at [[Monte Verde]], near [[Puerto Montt]] in Southern Chile. Its occupation dates to some 14,000 years ago and there is some disputed evidence of even earlier occupation. Over the course of millennia, people spread to all parts of the continents. By the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]], South America's vast rainforests, mountains, plains and coasts were the home of tens of millions of people. The earliest settlements in the Americas are of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas Culture]]<ref>The preceramic Las Vegas culture of coastal Ecuador https://www.jstor.org/pss/280325</ref> from about 8000&nbsp;BCE and 4600&nbsp;BCE, a sedentary group from the coast of [[Ecuador]], the forefathers of the more known [[Valdivia culture]], of the same era. Some groups formed more permanent settlements such as the [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] (or \"[[Muisca people|Muisca]]\" or \"Muysca\") and the [[Tairona]] groups. These groups are in the circum Caribbean region. The Chibchas of [[Colombia]], the [[Quechuas]] and [[Aymaras]] of [[Bolivia]] were the three indigenous groups that settled most permanently.\n\nThe region was home to many [[indigenous peoples]] and advanced civilizations, including the [[Aztecs]], [[Toltecs]], [[Maya Civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca]]. The [[golden age]] of the Maya began about 250, with the last two great [[civilization]]s, the Aztecs and Incas, emerging into prominence later on in the early fourteenth century and mid-fifteenth centuries, respectively. The Aztec empire was ultimately the most powerful civilization known throughout the Americas, until its downfall in part by the Spanish invasion.\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main|European colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n{{see also|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n[[File:Desembarco de Col\u00f3n de Di\u00f3scoro Puebla.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.00|[[Romanticism|Romantic]] painting of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] arriving to the Americas (''Primer desembarco de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n en Am\u00e9rica''), by [[Di\u00f3scoro Puebla]] (1862)]]\n[[File:Jal-ixco.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|[[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] leads [[Spain|Spanish]] soldiers with [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]]n allies against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous warriors]] during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|European colonization of the Americas]].]]\n\nWith the arrival of the Europeans following [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages, the indigenous elites, such as the Incas and Aztecs, lost power to the heavy European invasion. [[Hern\u00e1ndo Cort\u00e9s]] seized the Aztec elite's power with the help of local groups who had favored the Aztec elite, and [[Francisco Pizarro]] eliminated the Incan rule in Peru. The European powers of Spain and Portugal colonized the region, which along with the rest of the uncolonized world, was divided into areas of Spanish and Portuguese control by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|line of demarcation]] in 1494, which gave Spain all areas to the west, and Portugal all areas to the east (the Portuguese lands in South America subsequently becoming Brazil). By the end of the sixteenth century Spain and Portugal had been joined by others, including France, in occupying large areas of North, Central and South America, ultimately extending from Alaska to the southern tips of the [[Patagonia]]. European culture, customs and government were introduced, with the Roman Catholic Church becoming the major economic and political power to overrule the traditional ways of the region, eventually becoming the only official religion of the Americas during this period.\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nEpidemics of diseases brought by the Europeans, such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], wiped out a large portion of the indigenous population. Historians cannot determine the number of natives who died due to European diseases, but some put the figures as high as 85% and as low as 25%. Due to the lack of written records, specific numbers are hard to verify. Many of the survivors were forced to work in European plantations and mines. [[Miscegenation|Intermixing]] between the indigenous peoples and the European colonists was very common, and, by the end of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]], people of mixed ancestry ([[mestizo]]s) formed majorities in several colonies.\n\n====Slavery and forced labor in colonial Latin America====\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n{{see|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries.\n\nThe Mita of Colonial Latin America was a system of forced labor imposed on the natives. First established by Viceroy Francisco de Toledo (1569\u20131581), the Mita was upheld by laws that designated how large draft levies were and how much money the workers would receive that was based on how many shifts each individual worker performed. Toledo established Mitas at Potosi and Huancavelica, where the Mitayos\u2014the workers\u2014would be reduced in number to a fraction of how many were originally assigned before the 1700s. While several villages managed to resist the Mita, others offered payment to colonial administrators as a way out. In exchange, free labor became available through volunteers, though the Mita was kept in place as workers like miners, for example, were paid low wages. The Spanish Crown had not made any ruling on the Mita or approved of it when Toledo first established it in spite of the uncertainty of the practice since the Crown could have gained benefits from it. However, the cortes of Spain later abolished it in 1812 once complaints of the Mita violating humanitarian rights were made. Yet complaints also came from: governors; landowners; native leaders known as Kurakas; and even priests, each of whom preferred other methods of economic exploitation. Despite its fall, the Mita made it to the 1800s.<ref>Brown, K. W. (2008). Mita. In J. Kinsbruner & E. D.

The first slaves came over with Christopher Columbus from the very beginning on his earliest voyages. However in the few hundred years, the Atlantic Slave trade would begin delivering slaves, imported by Spain and other colonizers, by the millions. Many of the large scale productions were run by forced slave labor. They were a part of sugar and coffee production, farming (beans, rice, corn, fruit, etc.), Mining, whale oil and multiple other jobs. Slaves were also house workers, servants, military soldiers, and much more. To say the least these people were property and treated as such. Though indigenous slaves existed, they were no match in quantity and lack of quality jobs when compared to the African slave. The slave population was massive compared to the better known slave ownership in the United States. After 1860 Brazil alone had imported over 4 million slaves, which only represented about 35% of the Atlantic slave trade. Despite the large number of slaves in Latin America, there was not as much reproduction of slaves amongst the population. Because most of the slaves then were African-born, they were more subject to rebellion. The United States involvement in the slave trade is well known amongst North America, however it hides a larger and in some ways crueler operation in the south which had a much longer history.{{sfnp|Meade|2016|pp=53\u201357}}\n\n===Independence (1804\u20131825)===\n{{Main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n[[File:Bolivar Arturo Michelena.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.70|[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], Liberator of [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Panama]]]]\n\nIn 1804, Haiti became the first Latin American nation to gain independence, following a violent slave revolt led by [[Toussaint L'ouverture]] on the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]]. The victors abolished slavery. Haitian independence inspired independence movements in Spanish America.\n[[File:Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla.png|thumbnail|right|upright=0.70|[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] was the first leader of the [[Mexican War of Independence]].]]\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, Spanish and Portuguese power waned on the global scene as other European powers took their place, notably Britain and France. Resentment grew among the majority of the population in Latin America over the restrictions imposed by the Spanish government, as well as the dominance of native Spaniards (Iberian-born ''[[Peninsulares]]'') in the major social and political [[institution]]s. [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of Spain in 1808 marked a turning point, compelling [[Criollo people|Criollo]] elites to form [[junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]] that advocated independence. Also, the newly independent [[Haiti]], the second oldest nation in the [[New World]] after the United States, further fueled the independence movement by inspiring the leaders of the movement, such as [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] of Mexico, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of Venezuela and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and by providing them with considerable munitions and troops.\n\nFighting soon broke out between juntas and the Spanish colonial authorities, with initial victories for the advocates of independence. Eventually, these early movements were crushed by the [[Royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist troops]] by 1810, including those of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in [[Mexico]] in the year 1810. Later on [[Francisco de Miranda]] in [[Venezuela]] by 1812. Under the leadership of a new generation of leaders, such as [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] \"The Liberator\", [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and other ''[[Libertadores]]'' in South America, the independence movement regained strength, and by 1825, all [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], except for Puerto Rico and Cuba, had gained independence from Spain. In the same year in [[Mexico]], a military officer, [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], led a coalition of conservatives and liberals who created a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Iturbide as [[emperor]]. This [[First Mexican Empire]] was short-lived, and was followed by the creation of a [[republic]] in 1823.\n\n====Independent Empire of Brazil====\n{{Main|Independence of Brazil|Empire of Brazil}}\n[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|Declaration of the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]] by the later [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro&nbsp;I]] on September 7, 1822]]\n\nThe [[Brazilian War of Independence]], which had already begun along other independent movements around the region, spread through northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;168, 164, 178</ref> With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824,<ref name=\"Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp. 179\u2013180\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;179\u2013180</ref> Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.<ref name=\"Lustosa, p. 208\">Lustosa, p.&nbsp;208</ref>\n\n[[File:Pedro Am\u00e9rico - D.

''El liberalismo hispanoamericano'' en el siglo XIX. pg2</ref> Conservatism was the dominant system of government prior to the revolutions and it was founded on having social classes, including governing by kings. Liberalists wanted to see a change in the ruling systems, and to move away from monarchs and social classes in order to promote equality.\n\nWhen liberal [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of Mexico in 1824, conservatists relied on their belief that the state had been better off before the new government came into power, so, by comparison, the old government was better in the eyes of the Conservatives. Following this sentiment, the conservatives pushed to take control of the government, and they succeeded. [[General Santa Anna]] was elected president in 1833. The following decade, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u201348) caused Mexico to lose a significant amount of territory to the United States. This loss led to a rebellion by the enraged liberal forces against the conservative government.\n\nIn 1837, conservative [[Rafael Carrera]] conquered [[Guatemala]] and separated from the [[Central American Union]]. The instability that followed the disintegration of the union led to the independence of the other Central American countries.\n\nIn [[Brazil]], rural aristocrats were in conflict with the urban conservatives. Portuguese control over Brazilian ports continued after Brazil's independence. Following the conservative idea that the old government was better, urbanites tended to support conservatism because more opportunities were available to them as a result of the Portuguese presence.\n\n[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] became president of [[Gran Colombia]] in 1819 after the region gained independence from Spain. He led a military-controlled state. Citizens did not like the government's position under Bol\u00edvar: The people in the military were unhappy with their roles, and the civilians were of the opinion that the military had too much power. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, New Grenada continued to have conflicts between conservatives and liberals. These conflicts were each concentrated in particular regions, with conservatives particularly in the southern mountains and the Valley of Cauca. In the mid-1840s some leaders in Caracas organized a liberal opposition. Antonio Leocadio Guzman was an active participant and journalist in this movement and gained much popularity among the people of Caracas.<ref>Halper\u00edn Donghi, T. (2013). ''Historia contempor\u00e1nea de Am\u00e9rica latina''. Madrid: Alianza.</ref>\n\nIn [[Argentina]], the conflict manifested itself as a prolonged civil war between ''[[Unitarian Party|unitarianas]]'' (i.e. ''centralists'') and ''[[Federales|federalists]]'', which were in some aspects respectively analogous to liberals and conservatives in other countries. Between 1832 and 1852, the country existed as a [[Argentine Confederation|confederation]], without a head of state, although the federalist governor of Buenos Aires province, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], was given the powers of debt payment and international relations and exerted a growing hegemony over the country. A national constitution was only enacted in 1853, reformed in 1860, and the country reorganized as a federal republic led by a [[Generation of '80|liberal-conservative elite]].<ref>Galasso, N. (2011). ''Historia de la Argentina'' (Vol. 1).</ref> After Uruguay achieved its independence, in 1828, a similar polarization crystallized between ''blancos'' and ''colorados'', where the agrarian conservative interests were pitted against the liberal commercial interests based in Montevideo, and which eventually resulted in the ''[[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]]'' civil war (1839\u20131851).<ref>Hudson, R., & Meditz, S.

The next year the British attacked once again with a much larger force attempting to reach and conquer Montevideo.<ref>Donghi, 89</ref> They failed to reach [[Montevideo]] but succeeded in establishing an alliance with the locals.

On May 8, 1827 Baron Damas, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Sebasti\u00e1n Camacho, a Mexican diplomat, signed an agreement called \"The Declarations\" which contained provisions regarding commerce and navigation between France and Mexico. At this time the French government did not recognize Mexico as an independent entity.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Robertson|first1=William Spence|title=French Intervention in Mexico in 1838|journal=The Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=24|issue=2|date=1944|publisher=Duke University Press|pages=222\u2013223|jstor=2507834|doi=10.2307/2507834}}</ref> It was not until 1861 that the liberalist rebels, led by Benito Ju\u00e1rez, took control of Mexico City, consolidating liberal rule. However, the constant state of warfare left Mexico with a tremendous amount of debt owed to Spain, England, and France, all of whom funded the Mexican war effort (Neeno). As newly appointed president, Benito Ju\u00e1rez suspended payment of debts for next two years, to focus on a rebuilding and stabilization initiative in Mexico under the new government. On December 8, 1861, Spain, England and France landed in Veracruz in order to seize unpaid debts from Mexico. However, Napoleon III, with intentions of establishing a French client state to further push his economic interests, pressured the other two powers to withdraw in 1862 (Greenspan; \"French Intervention in Mexico\u2026\").\n[[File:Batalla de Puebla.png|upright=0.80|thumb|right|Painting depicting the [[Battle of Puebla]] in 1862]]\nFrance under Napoleon III remained and established Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=French Intervention in Mexico and the American Civil War, 1862\u20131867|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/french-intervention |website=U.S Department of State Office of the Historian}}</ref> The march by the French to Mexico City enticed heavy resistance by the Mexican government, it resulted in open warfare. The Battle of Puebla in 1862 in particular presented an important turning point in which Ignacio Zaragoza led the Mexican army to victory as they pushed back the French offensive (\"Timeline of the Mexican Revolution\"). The victory came to symbolize Mexico's power and national resolve against foreign occupancy and as a result delayed France's later attack on Mexico City for an entire year (Cinco de Mayo (Mexican History)). With heavy resistance by Mexican rebels and the fear of United States intervention against France, forced Napoleon III to withdraw from Mexico, leaving Maximilian to surrender, where he would be later executed by Mexican troops under the rule of Porfirio D\u00edaz.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ridge Jr.|first1=Michael Allen|title=A country in need of American instruction : The U.S. mission to shape and transform Mexico, 1848\u20131911|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3321&context=etd|website=Iowa Research Online|publisher=University of Iowa}}</ref> Napoleon III's desire to expand France's economic empire influenced the decision to seize territorial domain over the Central American region. The port city of Veracruz, Mexico and France's desire to construct a new canal were of particular interest. Bridging both New World and East Asian trade routes to the Atlantic were key to Napoleon III's economic goals to the mining of precious rocks and the expansion of France's textile industry. Napoleon's fear of the United States' economic influence over the Pacific trade region, and in turn all New World economic activity, pushed France to intervene in Mexico under the pretense of collecting on Mexico's debt. Eventually France began plans to build the Panama Canal in 1881 until 1904 when the United States took over and proceeded with its construction and implementation (\"Read Our Story\").\n\n===American involvement in Latin America during the 19th century===\n\n====Monroe Doctrine====\n[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the [[Monroe Doctrine]] to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]]]]\nThe [[Monroe Doctrine]] was included in President [[James Monroe]]'s 1823 annual message to Congress. The doctrine warns European nations that the United States will no longer tolerate any new colonization of Latin American countries. It was originally drafted to meet the present major concerns, but eventually became the precept of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. The doctrine was put into effect in 1865 when the U.S. government supported Mexican president, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], diplomatically and militarily. Some Latin American countries viewed the U.S. interventions, allowed by the Monroe Doctrine when the U.S. deems necessary, with suspicion.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. ''A History of Latin America''. pg 491</ref>\n\nAnother important aspect of United States involvement in Latin America is the case of the [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. In 1855, he traveled to Nicaragua hoping to overthrow the government and take the land for the United States. With only the aid of 56 followers, he was able to take over the city of [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], declaring himself commander of the army and installing [[Patricio Rivas]] as a puppet president. However, Rivas's presidency ended when he fled Nicaragua; Walker rigged the following election to ensure that he became the next president. His presidency did not last long, however, as he was met with much opposition from political groups in Nicaragua and neighbouring countries. On May 1, 1857, Walker was forced by a coalition of Central American armies to surrender himself to a United States Navy officer who repatriated him and his followers. When Walker subsequently returned to Central America in 1860, he was apprehended by the Honduran authorities and executed.\n\n====Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u201348)====\n[[File:Mexico nebel.jpg|thumb|left|American occupation of [[Mexico City]]]]\n\nThe [[Mexican\u2013American War]], another instance of U.S. involvement in Latin America, was a war between the United States and Mexico that started in April 1846 and lasted until February 1848. The main cause of the war was the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845 and a dispute afterwards about whether the border between Mexico and the United States ended where Mexico claimed, at the [[Nueces River]], or ended where the United States claimed, at the [[Rio Grande]]. Peace was negotiated between the United States and Mexico with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which stated that Mexico was to cede land which would later become part of California and New Mexico as well as give up all claims to Texas, for which the United States would pay $15,000,000. However, tensions between the two countries were still high and over the next six years things only got worse with raids along the border and attacks by Native Americans against Mexican citizens. To defuse the situation, the United States agreed to purchase 29,670 squares miles of land from Mexico for $10,000,000 so a southern railroad could be built to connect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. This would become known as the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. A critical component of U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs took form in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which drastically affected the futures of Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Americas, as well as Guam and the Philippines, by dismantling some of the last remaining Spanish colonial possessions throughout the world.\n\n==From the \"Big Stick\" to the \"Good Neighbor\" policy==\n[[File:Satterfield cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield]] cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic]]\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the U.S. banana importing companies [[United Fruit Company]], [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] (both ancestors of [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]]), and [[Standard Fruit Company]] (now [[Dole Food Company|Dole]]), acquired large amounts of land in Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica.

The proposal was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence. The revelation of the contents outraged the American public and swayed public opinion. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] moved to arm American merchant ships in order to defend themselves against German submarines, which had started to attack them. The news helped generate support for the [[American entry into World War I|United States declaration of war on Germany]] in April of that year.<ref>[[#Andrew|Andrew]], p.&nbsp;42.</ref>\n\nThe message came as a [[code (cryptography)|coded]] telegram dispatched by the Foreign Secretary of the German Empire, [[Arthur Zimmermann]], on January 16, 1917. The message was sent to the German ambassador of Mexico, [[Heinrich von Eckardt]]. Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of the [[Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I#1917: Renewed \"unrestricted\" campaign|resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare]] by Germany on 1 February, an act which Germany presumed would lead to war. The telegram instructed Ambassador Eckardt that if the U.S. appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican Government with a proposal for a military alliance, with funding from Germany. As part of the alliance, Germany would assist Mexico in reconquering Texas and the Southwest. Eckardt was instructed to urge Mexico to help broker an alliance between Germany and Japan. Mexico, in the middle of the [[Mexican Revolution]], far weaker militarily, economically and politically than the U.S., ignored the proposal; after the U.S. entered the war, it officially rejected it.\n\n====Brazil's participation in World War II====\nAfter World War I, in which Brazil was an ally of the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and [[France]], the country realized it needed a more capable army but did not have the technology to create it. In 1919, the French Military Mission was established by the French Commission in Brazil. Their main goal was to contain the inner rebellions in Brazil. They tried to assist the army by bringing them up to the European military standard but constant civil missions did not prepare them for [[World War II]].\n\nBrazil's President, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], wanted to industrialize Brazil, allowing it to be more competitive with other countries. He reached out to Germany, Italy, France, and the United States to act as trade allies. Many Italian and German people immigrated to Brazil many years before World War II began thus creating a Nazi influence. The immigrants held high positions in government and the armed forces. It was recently found that 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including Croats, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided the Nazi war machine. Most, perhaps as many as 5,000, went to Argentina; between 1,500 and 2,000 are thought to have made it to Brazil; around 500 to 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Secret Files Reveal 9,000 Nazi War Criminals Fled to South America after WWII|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2117093/Secret-files-reveal-9-000-Nazi-war-criminals-fled-South-America-WWII.html|newspaper=Mail Online|accessdate=24 May 2012|location=London|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=2012-03-19}}</ref> It was not a secret that Vargas had an admiration for Hitler's Nazi Germany and its F\u00fchrer. He even let German Luftwaffe build secret air forces around Brazil.\nThis alliance with Germany became Brazil's second best trade alliance behind the United States.\n\n[[File:Massarosaw.jpg|right|thumb|Brazilian soldiers greet Italian civilians in the city of [[Massarosa]], September 1944. Brazil was the only independent Latin American country to send ground troops to fight in WWII.]]\n\nBrazil continued to try to remain neutral to the United States and Germany because it was trying to make sure it could continue to be a place of interest for both opposing countries. Brazil attended continental meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1936); Lima, Peru (1938); and Havana, Cuba (1940) that obligated them to agree to defend any part of the Americas if they were to be attacked. Eventually, Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.\n\nOnce the German submarines attacked unarmed Brazilian trading ships, President Vargas met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss how they could retaliate. On January 22, 1942, Brazil officially ended all relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy, becoming a part of the Allies.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] was sent to Naples, Italy to fight for democracy. Brazil was the only Latin American country to send troops to Europe. Initially, Brazil wanted to only provide resources and shelter for the war to have a chance of gaining a high postwar status but ended up sending 25,000 men to fight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penteado|first=Carlos Joes A.|title=Hyper War: The Brazilian Participation in World War II|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Brazil/Participation/index.html|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the United States and Latin America continued to have a close relationship.

The removal of forest to make way for [[cattle ranching]] was the leading cause of deforestation in the Brazilian [[Amazon rainforest]] from the mid-1960s. [[Soybean]]s have become one of the most important contributors to deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon.<ref>\"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7206165.stm Brazil Amazon deforestation soars]\". BBC News. 24 January 2008.</ref>]]\n\nThe Great Depression caused Latin America to grow at a slow rate, separating it from leading industrial democracies. The two world wars and U.S. Depression also made Latin American countries favor internal economic development, leading Latin America to adopt the policy of [[import substitution industrialization]].<ref name=\"History of Latin America\">{{cite web|title=History of Latin America|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Countries also renewed emphasis on exports. Brazil began selling automobiles to other countries, and some Latin American countries set up plants to assemble imported parts, letting other countries take advantage of Latin America's low labor costs. Colombia began to export flowers, emeralds and coffee grains and gold, becoming the world's second-leading flower exporter.\n\nEconomic integration was called for, to attain economies that could compete with the economies of the United States or Europe. Starting in the 1960s with the Latin American Free Trade Association and Central American Common Market, Latin American countries worked toward economic integration.\n\nIn efforts to help regain global economic strength, the U.S. began to heavily assist countries involved in World War II at the expense of Latin America. Markets that were previously unopposed as a result of the war in Latin America grew stagnant as the rest of the world no longer needed their goods.\n\n====Reforms====\nLarge countries like Argentina called for reforms to lessen the disparity of wealth between the rich and the poor, which has been a long problem in Latin America that stunted economic growth.<ref name=\"Kaufman\">{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Robert|title=The Political Effects of Inequality: Some Inconvenient Facts|publisher=Rutgers University}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in public health caused an explosion of population growth, making it difficult to provide social services. Education expanded, and social security systems introduced, but benefits usually went to the middle class, not the poor. As a result, the disparity of wealth increased. Increasing inflation and other factors caused countries to be unwilling to fund social development programs to help the poor.\n\n====Bureaucratic authoritarianism====\nBureaucratic authoritarianism was practised in Brazil after 1964, in Argentina, and in Chile under Augusto Pinochet, in a response to harsh economic conditions. It rested on the conviction that no democracy could take the harsh measures to curb inflation, reassure investors, and quicken economic growth quickly and effectively. Though inflation fell sharply, industrial production dropped with the decline of official protection.<ref name=\"Kaufman\" />\n\n====US relations====\n{{see also|Latin America\u2013United States relations|Foreign interventions by the United States|United States involvement in regime change in Latin America}}\n[[File:Reuni\u00f3n Pinochet - Kissinger.jpg|thumb|Chilean dictator [[Augusto Pinochet]] shaking hands with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in 1976]]\nAfter [[World War II]] and the beginning of a [[Cold War]] between the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], US diplomats became interested in [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and Latin America, and frequently{{vague|date=June 2014}} waged proxy wars against the Soviet Union in these countries. The US sought to stop the spread of communism. Latin American countries generally sided with the US in the Cold War period, even though they were neglected since the US's concern with communism were focused in Europe and Asia, not Latin America.

Eisenhower]] concluded that Trujillo had become a Cold War liability.<ref name=Rabe/> In 1960, Trujillo threatened to align with the Communist world in response to US and Latin American rejection of his regime. La Voz Dominicana and Radio Caribe began attacking the US in Marxian terms, and the Dominican Communist party was legalized.

The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, and combined with Castro's expropriation of private enterprises, this was detrimental to the Cuban economy.<ref name=\"History of Latin America\" /> Around Latin America, rural guerrilla conflict and urban terrorism increased, inspired by the Cuban example. The United States put down these rebellions by supporting Latin American countries in their counter-guerrilla operations through the Alliance for Progress launched by President John F. Kennedy. This thrust appeared to be successful. A Marxist, Salvador Allende, became president of Chile in 1970, but was overthrown three years later in a military coup backed by the United States. Despite civil war, high crime and political instability, most Latin American countries eventually adopted bourgeois liberal democracies while Cuba maintained its socialist system.\n\n====Bay of Pigs Invasion====\n{{Main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}\n\n[[Image:Attack near Playa Giron.

The incident proved to be very embarrassing for the new Kennedy administration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bay of Pigs Invasion|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of the invasion led to a [[Cuba\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet-Cuban alliance]].\n\n====Cuban Missile Crisis====\n{{Main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}\nIn 1962, Cuba threatened the USA when it allowed Soviet missiles to be placed on the island, just 90 miles away from Florida; Cuba saw it as a way to defend the island, while the Americans saw it as a threat. The ensuing Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014the closest the world has ever come to total annihilation\u2014almost saw a US invasion or bombing of Cuba, but it ended when the two sides agreed on the removal of missiles; the US removed theirs from Italy and Turkey, while the Soviets removed theirs from Cuba. The crisis' end left Cuba blockaded by the US, which was also obligated to not invade Cuba. In fact, they were allowed to keep [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] as a naval base as per an agreement with the previous government of Batista.\n\n====Alliance for Progress====\nPresident John F. Kennedy initiated the [[Alliance for Progress]] in 1961, to establish economic cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America. The Alliance would provide $20 billion for reform in Latin America, and counterinsurgency measures. Instead, the reform failed because of the simplistic theory that guided it and the lack of experienced American experts who could understand Latin American customs.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kennedy proposes Alliance for Progress - Mar 13, 1961 - HISTORY.com|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/kennedy-proposes-alliance-for-progress|website=HISTORY|accessdate=10 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Foreign interventions by Cuba====\n{{Main|Foreign interventions by Cuba}}\n[[File:Cuban PT-76 Angola.JPG|thumb|A Cuban [[PT-76]] performing routine security duties in [[Angola]] during the [[Cuban intervention in Angola|Cuban intervention into the country]]]]\n[[File:Cubans in Ogaden1.JPG|thumb|Cuban artillerymen in [[Ethiopia]] during the [[Ogaden War]]]]\nArmed Cuban intervention overseas began on 14 June 1959 with an invasion of the Dominican Republic<ref name=CIA/> by a group of fifty-six men, who landed a [[Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar|C-56]] transport aircraft at the military airport of the town of Constanza.

The era of Somoza family rule was characterized by strong U.S. support for the government and its military as well as a heavy reliance on U.S.-based multi-national corporations. The Nicaraguan Revolution (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n Nicarag\u00fcense or Revoluci\u00f3n Popular Sandinista) encompassed the rising opposition to the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s, the campaign led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) to violently oust the dictatorship in 1978\u201379, the subsequent efforts of the FSLN to govern Nicaragua from 1979 until 1990 and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Contra War]] which was waged between the FSLN and the [[Contras]] from 1981\u20131990.\n\nThe Revolution marked a significant period in Nicaraguan history and revealed the country as one of the major proxy war battlegrounds of the Cold War with the events in the country rising to international attention. Although the initial overthrow of the Somoza regime in 1978\u201379 was a bloody affair, the Contra War of the 1980s took the lives of tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and was the subject of fierce international debate.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. A history of Latin America. pg541-542</ref> During the 1980s both the FSLN (a leftist collection of political parties) and the Contras (a rightist collection of counter-revolutionary groups) received large amounts of aid from the Cold War super-powers (respectively, the Soviet Union and the United States).\n\n===Washington Consensus===\n{{Main|Washington Consensus}}\n{{See also|Free Trade Area of the Americas}}\n[[File:Ship passing through Panama Canal 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roll-on/roll-off]]\nships, such as this one pictured here at [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores locks]], are among the largest ships to pass through the [[Panama Canal]]. The canal cuts across the Isthmus of [[Panama]] and is a key conduit for international maritime trade.]]\n\nThe set of specific economic policy prescriptions that were considered the \"standard\" reform package were promoted for crisis-wracked developing countries by Washington, D.C.-based institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), [[World Bank]], and the [[United States Department of the Treasury|US Department of the Treasury]] during the 1980s and 1990s.\n\nIn recent years, several Latin American countries led by socialist or other left wing governments{{spaced ndash}}including Argentina and Venezuela{{spaced ndash}}have campaigned for (and to some degree adopted) policies contrary to the Washington Consensus set of policies. (Other Latin countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Peru, have in practice adopted the bulk of the policies.) Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the International Monetary Fund have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the \"fundamentalist\" policies of the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury for what Stiglitz calls a \"one size fits all\" treatment of individual economies.\n\nThe term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries' national sovereignty.\n\nThis politico-economical initiative was institutionalized in North America by 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], and elsewhere in the Americas through a series of [[Free Trade Area of the Americas#Agreements|like agreements]]. The comprehensive [[Free Trade Area of the Americas]] project, however, was rejected by most [[Mercosur|South American countries]] at the 2005 [[4th Summit of the Americas]].\n\n===Turn to the left===\n{{See also|Pink tide}}\n[[File:UNASUR-15SEP2008.jpg|thumb|right|[[UNASUR]] summit in the Palacio de la Moneda, Santiago de Chile]]\nIn most countries, since the 2000s left-wing political parties have risen to power.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}} The presidencies of [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] in Venezuela, [[Ricardo Lagos]] and [[Michelle Bachelet]] in Chile, [[Lula da Silva]] and [[Dilma Rousseff]] in Brazil, [[N\u00e9stor Kirchner]] and his wife [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez de Kirchner|Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] in Argentina, [[Tabar\u00e9 V\u00e1zquez]] and [[Jos\u00e9 Mujica]] in Uruguay, [[Evo Morales]] in Bolivia, [[Daniel Ortega]] in Nicaragua, [[Rafael Correa]] in Ecuador, [[Fernando Lugo]] in Paraguay, [[Manuel Zelaya]] in [[Honduras]] (removed from power by a [[2009 Honduran coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]]), [[Mauricio Funes]] and [[Salvador S\u00e1nchez Cer\u00e9n]] in El Salvador are all part of this wave of [[left-wing]] politicians who often declare themselves [[Socialism|socialists]], [[Latin American integration|Latin Americanists]], or [[Anti-Imperialism|anti-imperialists]] (often implying [[Anti-Americanism#Latin America|opposition to US]] [[Washington consensus|policies towards the region]]). A development of this has been the creation of the eight-member ALBA alliance, or \"[[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America]]\" (Spanish: ''Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra Am\u00e9rica'') by some of the countries already mentioned.

A \"reversal of development\" reigned over Latin America, seen through negative economic growth, declines in industrial production, and thus, falling living standards for the middle and lower classes.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Escobar|editor-first=Arturo|editor-first2=Sonia E.|editor-last2=Alvarez|title=The Making of Social Movements in Latin America|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Westview|date=1992}}</ref> Governments made financial security their primary policy goal over social security, enacting new neoliberal economic policies that implemented privatization of previously national industries and [[Informal sector|informalization]] of labor.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> In an effort to bring more investors to these industries, these governments also embraced [[globalization]] through more open interactions with the international economy.\n\nSignificantly, as democracy spread across much of Latin America, the realm of government became more inclusive (a trend that proved conducive to social movements), the economic ventures remained exclusive to a few elite groups within society. Neoliberal restructuring consistently redistributed income upward while denying political responsibility to provide social welfare rights, and though [[Development studies|development]] projects took place throughout the region, both inequality and poverty increased.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> Feeling excluded from these new projects, the lower classes took ownership of their own democracy through a revitalization of social movements in Latin America.\n\nBoth urban and rural populations had serious grievances as a result of the above economic and global trends and have voiced them in mass demonstrations. Some of the largest and most violent of these have been protests against cuts in urban services, such as the [[Caracazo]] in Venezuela and the [[Argentinazo]] in Argentina.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\">Johnston, Hank, and Paul Almeida, eds.

These movements have benefited considerably from transnational support from conservationists and [[International nongovernmental organizations|INGOs]]. The [[Landless Workers' Movement|Movement of Rural Landless Workers]] (MST) is perhaps the largest contemporary Latin American social movement.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> As indigenous populations are primarily rural, indigenous movements account for a large portion of rural social movements, including the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista rebellion]] in Mexico, the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador|CONAIE]]), indigenous organizations in the Amazon region of Ecuador and Bolivia, pan-Mayan communities in Guatemala, and mobilization by the indigenous groups of [[Yanomami]] peoples in the Amazon, [[Guna people|Kuna]] peoples in Panama, and Altiplano [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples in Bolivia.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> Other significant types of social movements include labor struggles and strikes, such as [[recovered factories]] in Argentina, as well as gender-based movements such as the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] in Argentina and protests against [[maquila]] production, which is largely a women's issue because of how it draws on women for cheap labor.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" />\n\n===Modern era===\nThe [[2000s commodities boom]] caused positive effects for many Latin American economies.

In the Spanish and Portuguese empires, racial mixing or miscegenation was the norm and something that the Spanish and Portuguese had grown rather accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans in the Iberian peninsula. But, demographics may have made this inevitable as well. Thus, for example, of the approximately 13.5 million people who lived in the Spanish colonies in 1800 before independence only about one fifth were white. This contrasts with the U.S., where more than four fifths were whites (out of a population of 5.3 million in 1801, 900,000 were slaves, plus approximately 60,000 free blacks). ...\n\nThe fact of the recognition of a racial continuum in Hispanic American (sic) does not mean that there wasn't discrimination, which there was, or that there wasn't an obsession with race, or 'castes', as they were sometimes called. ...\n\nIn areas with large indigenous Amerindian populations, a racial mixture resulted, which is known in Spanish as ''mestizos'' ... who are a majority in Mexico, Central America and most of South America. Similarly, when African slaves were brought to the Caribbean region and Brazil, where there was very little indigenous presence left, unions between them and Spanish produced a population of mixed ''mulatos'' ... who are a majority of the population in many of those Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela). \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/race.htm|title=Hispanics and Race|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nAske has also written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Spanish colonization was rather different from later English, or British, colonization of North America. They had different '''systems of colonization''' and different methods of subjugation. While the English were primarily interested in grabbing land, the Spanish in addition had a mandate to incorporate the land's inhabitants into their society, something which was achieved by religious conversion and sexual unions which produced a new 'race' of ''mestizos'', a mixture of Europeans and indigenous peoples. ''mestizos'' (sic) form the majority of the population in Mexico, Central America, and much of South America. Racial mixing or miscegenation, after all, was something that the Spanish and Portuguese had been accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans.\n\nSimilarly, later on, when African slaves were introduced into the Caribbean basin region, unions between them and Spaniards produced a population of ''mulatos'', who are a majority of the population in the Caribbean islands (the Antilles) (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico), as well as other areas of the Caribbean region (Colombia, Venezuela and parts of the Central American Caribbean coast). ''mestizos'' (sic) and ''mulatos'' may not have always have been first class citizens in their countries, but they were never disowned in the way the outcomes of unions of Europeans and Native Americans were in the British colonies, where interracial marriages were taboo and one drop of Black or Amerindian blood was enough to make the person 'impure'. \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/history.htm|title=Some historical background|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nIn his famous 1963 book ''[[The Rise of the West]]'', [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Racially mixed societies arose in most of Spanish and Portuguese America, compounded in varying proportions from European, Indian, and Negro strands. Fairly frequent resort to manumission mitigated the hardships of slavery in those areas; and the Catholic church positively encouraged marriages between white immigrants and Indian women as a remedy for sexual immorality. However, in the southern English colonies and in most of the Caribbean islands, the importation of Negro slaves created a much more sharply polarized biracial society. Strong race feeling and the servile status of nearly all Negroes interdicted intermarriage, practically if not legally. Such discrimination did not prevent interbreeding; but children of mixed parentage were assigned to the status of their mothers. Mulattoes and Indian half-breeds were thereby excluded from the white community. In Spanish (and, with some differences, Portuguese) territories a more elaborate and less oppressive principle of racial discrimination established itself. The handful of persons who had been born in the homelands claimed topmost social prestige; next came those of purely European descent; while beneath ranged the various racial blends to form a social pyramid whose numerous racial distinctions meant that no one barrier could become as ugly and inpenetrable as that dividing whites from Negroes in the English, Dutch, and French colonies.\n}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community|last=McNeill|first=William H.|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}, p. 603</ref>\n\nThomas C. Wright, meanwhile, has written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The demographic makeup of colonial Latin America became more complex when, as the native population declined, the Portuguese, Spanish, and the French in Haiti turned to Africa for labor, as did the British in North America. The tricontinental heritage that characterizes Latin America, then, is shared by the United States, but even a casual examination reveals that the outcome of the complex interaction of different peoples has varied. While miscegenation among the three races certainly occurred in North America, it appears to have been much less common than in Latin America. Furthermore, offspring of such liaisons were not recognized as belonging to new, distinct racial categories in North America as they were in Latin America. The terms mestizo or ''mameluco'', mulatto, the general term ''castas'', and dozens of subcategories of racial identity frankly recognized the outcomes of interracial sexual activity in Latin America and established a continuum of race rather than the unrealistic absolute categories of white, black, or Indian as used in the United States.

It is the product of many diverse influences:\n\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] cultures of the people who inhabited the continent prior to European Colonization. Ancient and very advanced civilizations developed their own political, social and religious systems. The [[Maya civilization|Mayas]], the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca civilization|Incas]] are examples of these. Indigenous legacies in music, dance, foods, arts and crafts, clothing, folk culture and traditions are very strong in Latin America. Linguistic effects on [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are also marked, such as in terms like [[pampa]], [[taco]], [[tamale]], [[cacique]].\n* [[Western culture|Western civilization]], in particular the [[culture of Europe]], was brought mainly by the colonial powers{{spaced ndash}}the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[French people|French]]{{spaced ndash}}between the 16th and 19th centuries. The most enduring European colonial influence is language and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. More recently, additional cultural influences came from the United States and Europe during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, due to the growing influence of the former on the world stage and immigration from the latter. The influence of the United States is particularly strong in northern Latin America, especially Puerto Rico, which is an American territory. Prior to 1959, Cuba, who fought for its independence along American soldiers in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], was also known to have a close socioeconomic relation with the United States. In addition, the United States also helped Panama become an independent state from Colombia and built the twenty-mile-long [[Panama Canal Zone]] in Panama which held from 1903 (the [[Panama Canal]] opened to transoceanic freight traffic in 1914) to 1999, when the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]] restored Panamanian control of the Canal Zone. South America experienced waves of immigration of Europeans, especially Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Russians, Croatians, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews. With the end of colonialism, [[Culture of France|French culture]] was also able to exert a direct influence in Latin America, especially in the realms of [[high culture]], science and medicine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stepan|first=Nancy Leys |title=\"The Hour of Eugenics\": Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |location=Ithaca |pages=in passim |nopp=true |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NuUxkMC1ePYC |isbn=978-0-8014-9795-7}}</ref> This can be seen in any expression of the region's artistic traditions, including painting, literature and music, and in the realms of science and politics. \nDue to the impact of Enlightenment ideals after the French revolution, a certain number of Iberian-American countries decriminalized homosexuality after France and French territories in the Americas in 1791. Some of the countries that abolished sodomy laws or banned any reference to state interference in consensual adult sexuality in the 19th century were Dominican Republic (1822), Brazil (1824), Peru (1836), Mexico (1871), Paraguay (1880), Argentina (1887), Honduras (1899), Guatemala and El Salvador. Today same-sex marriage is legal in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Uruguay, and French overseas departments, as well as in several states of Mexico. Civil unions can be held in Chile.\n\n* [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]], whose presence derives from a long history of [[Atlantic slave trade|New World slavery]]. Peoples of African descent have influenced the ethno-scapes of Latin America and the Caribbean. This is manifested for instance in music, dance and religion, especially in countries like Brazil, Uruguay, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Haiti, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Cuba.\n* [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], whose part of the presence derives from the long history of the [[Coolie|Coolie trade]] mostly arriving during the 19th and 20th centuries, and most commonly Chinese workers in Peru and Venezuela. But also from Japanese and Korean immigration especially headed to Brazil. This has largely effected the cuisine, traditions including literature, art and lifestyles and politics. The effects of Asian influences have especially and mostly effected the nations of The Dominican Republic, Brazil, Cuba, Panama and Peru.\n\n===Art===\n{{Main|Latin American art}}\n{{See also|List of Latin American artists}}\n[[File:RiveraMuralNationalPalace.jpg|thumbnail|left|[[Diego Rivera]]'s mural depicting Mexico's history at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace in Mexico City]]]]\n\nBeyond the rich tradition of indigenous art, the development of Latin American visual art owed much to the influence of Spanish, Portuguese and French Baroque painting, which in turn often followed the trends of the Italian Masters. In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.\n\n[[File:Santiago Martinez Delgado in the colombian congress.jpg|thumb|right|Mural by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] in the [[Colombian Congress]]]]\n\nFrom the early twentieth century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Barreiro |first=Gabriel|date=December 1994|title=Constructivism in Latin America |journal=University of Essex Collection of Latin American Art|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The Movement quickly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America.

He won his second [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 2016 for ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]''.]]\n\n[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] started out in the silent era from 1896 to 1929 and flourished in the [[Golden age of the cinema of Mexico|Golden Era]] of the 1940s. It boasted a huge industry comparable to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] at the time with stars such as [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and [[Pedro Infante]]. In the 1970s, <!-- and 1970s --> Mexico was the location for many cult horror and action movies. More recently, films such as ''[[Amores Perros]]'' (2000) and ''[[Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n]]'' (2001) enjoyed box office and critical acclaim and propelled [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] and [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] to the front rank of Hollywood directors. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu directed in 2010 ''[[Biutiful]]'' and [[Birdman (film)|''Birdman'']] (2014), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n directed ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013).  Close friend of both, [[Guillermo del Toro]], a top rank Hollywood director in Hollywood and Spain, directed ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (2006) and produced ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|El Orfanato]]'' (2007). [[Carlos Carrera]] (''[[The Crime of Father Amaro (film)|The Crime of Father Amaro]])'', and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are also some of the most known present-day Mexican film makers. ''[[Rudo y Cursi]]'' released in December (2008) in Mexico was directed by [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n]].\n[[File:Cristina, elenco y Oscar.jpg|left|thumb|President [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] with the film director [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella]] and the cast of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009) with the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film]]]]\n\n[[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine cinema]] has also been prominenent since the first half of the 20th century and today averages over 60 full-length titles yearly. The industry suffered during the [[Proceso de Reorganizaci\u00f3n Nacional|1976\u20131983 military dictatorship]]; but re-emerged to produce the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[The Official Story]]'' in 1985. A wave of imported U.S. films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentine economic crisis]] around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including ''[[Nueve reinas]]'' (2000), ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (2001), ''[[El abrazo partido]]'' (2004), ''[[El otro]]'' (2007), the 2010 Foreign Language [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[El secreto de sus ojos]]'' and ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (2014).\n\n[[Cinema of Brazil|In Brazil]], the ''[[Cinema Novo]]'' movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States, with movies such as ''[[Central do Brasil (film)|Central do Brasil]]'' (1999), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|Cidade de Deus]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (2007).\n\n[[Cinema of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican cinema]] has produced some notable films, such as ''[[Una Aventura Llamada Menudo]]'', ''[[Los Diaz de Doris]]'' and ''[[Casi Casi]]''. An influx of Hollywood films affected the local film industry in Puerto Rico during the 1980s and 1990s, but several Puerto Rican films have been produced since and it has been recovering.\n\n[[Cinema of Cuba|Cuban cinema]] has enjoyed much official support since the [[Cuban revolution]] and important film-makers include [[Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Latin American literature}}\n{{See also|List of Latin American writers}}\n\n[[File:Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1772).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] in 1772 by Andr\u00e9s de Islas]]\n[[File:Jorge Luis Borges Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Argentine [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in [[L'H\u00f4tel]], [[Paris]] in 1969]]\n\nPre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate [[Aztec codices|codices]]. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the [[Popol Vuh]]. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]-speaking population of Peru and the [[K'iche' people|Quich\u00e9 (K'iche')]] of Guatemala.\n\nFrom the very moment of Europe's discovery of the continents, early explorers and [[conquistadores]] produced written accounts and cr\u00f3nicas of their experience{{spaced ndash}}such as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s letters or [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]]'s description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive [[Criollo (people)|criollo]] literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's ''[[El Periquillo Sarniento]]'' (1816).\n\nThe 19th century was a period of \"foundational fictions\" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of \"civilization or barbarism\" (for which see, say, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Domingo Sarmiento]]'s ''[[Facundo]]'' (1845), [[Juan Le\u00f3n Mera]]'s ''Cumand\u00e1'' (1879), or [[Euclides da Cunha]]'s ''[[Os Sert\u00f5es]]'' (1902)). The 19th century also witnessed the realist work of [[Machado de Assis]], who made use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction, much admired by critic [[Harold Bloom]].\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, ''[[modernismo]]'' emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]]'s ''Azul'' (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]], for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.\n\n[[File:Gabriela Mistral-01.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Chilean poet [[Gabriela Mistral]], first Latin American to win a [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], in 1945]]\n[[File:Gabogarciamarquez1.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] signing a copy of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'']]\n\nHowever, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary [[Latin American Boom|boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude|Cien a\u00f1os de soledad]]'' (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with [[magic realism]], though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]] do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s monumental ''Yo, el supremo'' (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and above all [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also rediscovered.\n\nContemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling [[Paulo Coelho]] and [[Isabel Allende]] to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as [[Diamela Eltit]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Ricardo Piglia]], or [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o]]. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of [[Testimony#Literature|testimonio]], texts produced in collaboration with [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] subjects such as [[Rigoberta Mench\u00fa]]. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic [[Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is]] and Pedro Lemebel.\n\nThe region boasts six [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize winners]]: in addition to the two Chilean poets [[Gabriela Mistral]] (1945) and [[Pablo Neruda]] (1971), there is also the Guatemalan novelist [[Miguel Angel Asturias]] (1967), the Colombian writer [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (1982),  the Mexican poet and essayist [[Octavio Paz]] (1990), and the Peruvian novelist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (2010).\n\n===Music and dance===\n{{See also|Music of Latin America|Latin pop|Latin dance}}\n[[File:Salsa en Cali.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] dancing in [[Cali]], [[Colombia]]]]\n\nLatin America has produced many successful worldwide artists in terms of recorded global music sales.

[[Enrique Iglesias]], although not a Latin American, has also contributed for the success of Latin music.\n\nOther notable successful mainstream acts through the years, include [[RBD]], [[Celia Cruz]], [[Soda Stereo]], [[Thal\u00eda]], [[Ricky Martin]], [[Man\u00e1]], [[Marc Anthony]], [[Ricardo Arjona]], [[Selena]], and [[Menudo (band)|Menudo]].\n\nCaribbean Hispanic music, such as [[Merengue (music)|merengue]], [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], [[Salsa music|salsa]], and more recently [[reggaeton]], from such countries as the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Trinidad and Tobago, Cuba, and Panama, has been strongly influenced by African rhythms and melodies.

[[Samba]], North American [[jazz]], [[European classical music]] and [[choro]] combined to form ''[[bossa nova]]'' in Brazil, popularized by [[guitar]]ist [[Jo\u00e3o Gilberto]] with singer [[Astrud Gilberto]] and [[jazz piano|pianist]] [[Antonio Carlos Jobim]].\n\nOther influential Latin American sounds include the Antillean [[soca music|soca]] and [[calypso music|calypso]], the Honduran (Garifuna) [[punta]], the Colombian [[cumbia]] and [[vallenato]], the Chilean [[cueca]], the Ecuadorian [[boleros music|boleros]], and [[rockoleras]], the Mexican [[ranchera]] and the [[mariachi]] which is the epitome of Mexican soul, the Nicaraguan [[palo de Mayo]], the Peruvian [[marinera]] and [[tondero]], the Uruguayan [[candombe]], the French Antillean [[zouk]] (derived from Haitian compas) and the various styles of music from pre-Columbian traditions that are widespread in the [[Andean]] region.\n\n[[File:Carmen Miranda 1941.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Brazilian singer [[Carmen Miranda]] helped popularize [[samba]] internationally.]]\n\nThe classical composer [[Heitor Villa-Lobos]] (1887\u20131959) worked on the recording of native musical traditions within his homeland of Brazil.

Brazilian opera soprano [[Bidu Say\u00e3o]], one of Brazil's most famous musicians, was a leading artist of the Metropolitan Opera in New York City from 1937 to 1952.\n\n[[File:Tango-Show-Buenos-Aires-01.jpg|thumb|upright|A couple dances [[Tango (dance)|tango]].]]\n\nArguably, the main contribution to music entered through folklore, where the true soul of the Latin American and Caribbean countries is expressed. Musicians such as [[Yma S\u00famac]], [[Chabuca Granda]], [[Atahualpa Yupanqui]], [[Violeta Parra]], [[V\u00edctor Jara]], [[Jorge Cafrune]], [[Facundo Cabral]], [[Mercedes Sosa]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Luiz Gonzaga]], [[Caetano Veloso]], [[Susana Baca]], [[Chavela Vargas]], [[Simon Diaz]], [[Julio Jaramillo]], [[Toto la Momposina]], [[Gilberto Gil]], [[Maria Beth\u00e2nia]], [[Nana Caymmi]], [[Nara Le\u00e3o]], [[Gal Costa]], [[Ney Matogrosso]] as well as musical ensembles such as [[Inti Illimani]] and [[Los Kjarkas]] are magnificent examples of the heights that this soul can reach.\n\n[[Latin pop]], including many forms of [[Rock music|rock]], is popular in Latin America today (see [[Spanish language rock and roll]]).<ref>{{cite news|author=The Baltimore Sun |newspaper=The Michigan Daily |title=Latin music returns to America with wave of new pop starlets |url=http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1999/sep/09-28-99/arts/arts6.html |accessdate=2006-05-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050830190254/http://www.pub.umich.edu/daily/1999/sep/09-28-99/arts/arts6.html |archivedate=August 30, 2005}}</ref>  A few examples are [[Caf\u00e9 Tacuba]], [[Soda Stereo]], [[Man\u00e1]], [[Rita Lee]], [[Mutantes]], [[Secos e Molhados]] [[Legi\u00e3o Urbana]], [[Tit\u00e3s]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso]], [[Cazuza]], [[Bar\u00e3o Vermelho]], [[Skank (band)|Skank]], [[Miranda!]], [[CSS (band)|Cansei de Ser Sexy or CSS]], and Bajo Fondo.\n\nMore recently, reggaeton, which blends Jamaican reggae and dancehall with Latin America genres such as [[Bomba (Puerto Rico)|bomba]] and [[plena]], as well as [[hip hop]], is becoming more popular, in spite of the controversy surrounding its lyrics, dance steps ([[Perreo]]) and music videos.

The first event happened less than a decade before the publication of Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo works: the Invasion of Mexico or, in USA the [[Mexican- American war|Mexican\u2013American War]], after which Mexico lost a third of its territory. The second event, the [[Walker affair]], happened the same year both works were written: the decision by U.S. president [[Franklin Pierce]] to recognize the regime recently established in Nicaragua by American [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]] and his band of filibusters who ruled Nicaragua for nearly a year (1856\u201357) and attempted to reinstate slavery there, where it had been already abolished for three decades\n\nIn both Bilbao's and Torres Caicedo's works, the [[Mexican\u2013American War|Mexican-American War]] and Walker's expedition to Nicaragua are explicitly mentioned as examples of dangers for the region.  For Bilbao, \"Latin America\" was not a geographical concept, since he excluded Brazil, Paraguay and Mexico.  Both authors also ask for the union of all Latin American countries as the only way to defend their territories against further foreign U.S. interventions. Both rejected also European imperialism, claiming that the return of European countries to non-democratic forms of government was another danger for Latin American countries, and used the same word to describe the state of European politics at the time: \"despotism.\"  Several years later, during the [[French invasion of Mexico]], Bilbao wrote another work, \"Emancipation of the Spirit in America,\" where he asked all Latin American countries to support the Mexican cause against France, and rejected French imperialism in Asia, Africa, Europe and the Americas. He asked Latin American intellectuals to search for their \"intellectual emancipation\" by abandoning all French ideas, claiming that France was: \"Hypocrite, because she [France] calls herself protector of the Latin race just to subject it to her exploitation regime; treacherous, because she speaks of freedom and nationality, when, unable to conquer freedom for herself, she enslaves others instead!\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bilbao |first1=Francisco |title=Emancipaci\u00f3n del esp\u00edritu de Am\u00e9rica |url=http://www.franciscobilbao.cl/1909/article-81905.html |website=Francisco Bilbao Barqu\u00edn, 1823\u20131865, Chile|accessdate=16 July 2017}}</ref> Therefore, as Michel Gobat puts it, the term Latin America itself had an \"anti-imperial genesis,\" and their creators were far from supporting any form of imperialism in the region, or in any other place of the globe.\n\nHowever, in France the term Latin America was used with the opposite intention. It was employed by the French Empire of [[Napoleon III]] during the French invasion of Mexico as a way to include France among countries with influence in the Americas and to exclude [[Anglo America|Anglophone countries]]. It played a role in his campaign to imply cultural kinship of the region with France, transform France into a cultural and political leader of the area, and install [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian of Habsburg]] as emperor of the [[Second Mexican Empire]].<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Chasteen |first1=John Charles |authorlink1= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |title=Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America |trans-title= |url=https://books.google.com/?id=fC90B5xkYyIC&lpg=PA156&pg=PP1#v=onepage |accessdate=4 July 2010 |edition= |series= |volume= |year=2001 |origyear= |publisher=[[W.

Neither area is culturally or linguistically homogeneous; in substantial portions of Latin America (e.g., highland [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Mexico]], [[Guatemala]]), [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures and, to a lesser extent, Amerindian languages, are predominant, and in other areas, the influence of African cultures is strong (e.g., the Caribbean basin{{spaced ndash}}including parts of [[Colombia]] and [[Venezuela]]).\n\nThe term is not without controversy.  Historian Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo explores at length the \"allure and power\" of the idea of Latin America. He remarks at the outset, \"The idea of 'Latin America' ought to have vanished with the obsolescence of racial theory... But it is not easy to declare something dead when it can hardly be said to have existed,\" going on to say, \"The term is here to stay, and it is important.\"<ref>Mauricio Tenorio-Trillo, ''Latin America: The Allure and Power of an Idea''.

3.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|left|[[Maya Civilization|Mayan]] archeological site [[Chichen Itza]]. ]]\n\nThe earliest known settlement was identified at [[Monte Verde]], near [[Puerto Montt]] in Southern Chile. Its occupation dates to some 14,000 years ago and there is some disputed evidence of even earlier occupation. Over the course of millennia, people spread to all parts of the continents. By the first millennium [[Common Era|CE]], South America's vast rainforests, mountains, plains and coasts were the home of tens of millions of people. The earliest settlements in the Americas are of the [[Las Vegas culture (archaeology)|Las Vegas Culture]]<ref>The preceramic Las Vegas culture of coastal Ecuador https://www.jstor.org/pss/280325</ref> from about 8000&nbsp;BCE and 4600&nbsp;BCE, a sedentary group from the coast of [[Ecuador]], the forefathers of the more known [[Valdivia culture]], of the same era. Some groups formed more permanent settlements such as the [[Chibcha language|Chibcha]] (or \"[[Muisca people|Muisca]]\" or \"Muysca\") and the [[Tairona]] groups. These groups are in the circum Caribbean region. The Chibchas of [[Colombia]], the [[Quechuas]] and [[Aymaras]] of [[Bolivia]] were the three indigenous groups that settled most permanently.\n\nThe region was home to many [[indigenous peoples]] and advanced civilizations, including the [[Aztecs]], [[Toltecs]], [[Maya Civilization|Maya]], and [[Inca]]. The [[golden age]] of the Maya began about 250, with the last two great [[civilization]]s, the Aztecs and Incas, emerging into prominence later on in the early fourteenth century and mid-fifteenth centuries, respectively. The Aztec empire was ultimately the most powerful civilization known throughout the Americas, until its downfall in part by the Spanish invasion.\n\n===European colonization===\n{{Main|European colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonization of the Americas|Portuguese colonization of the Americas}}\n{{see also|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n[[File:Desembarco de Col\u00f3n de Di\u00f3scoro Puebla.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.00|[[Romanticism|Romantic]] painting of Italian explorer [[Christopher Columbus]] arriving to the Americas (''Primer desembarco de Crist\u00f3bal Col\u00f3n en Am\u00e9rica''), by [[Di\u00f3scoro Puebla]] (1862)]]\n[[File:Jal-ixco.jpg|thumb|upright=1.00|[[Crist\u00f3bal de Olid]] leads [[Spain|Spanish]] soldiers with [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]]n allies against [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous warriors]] during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|European colonization of the Americas]].]]\n\nWith the arrival of the Europeans following [[Christopher Columbus]]' voyages, the indigenous elites, such as the Incas and Aztecs, lost power to the heavy European invasion. [[Hern\u00e1ndo Cort\u00e9s]] seized the Aztec elite's power with the help of local groups who had favored the Aztec elite, and [[Francisco Pizarro]] eliminated the Incan rule in Peru. The European powers of Spain and Portugal colonized the region, which along with the rest of the uncolonized world, was divided into areas of Spanish and Portuguese control by the [[Treaty of Tordesillas|line of demarcation]] in 1494, which gave Spain all areas to the west, and Portugal all areas to the east (the Portuguese lands in South America subsequently becoming Brazil). By the end of the sixteenth century Spain and Portugal had been joined by others, including France, in occupying large areas of North, Central and South America, ultimately extending from Alaska to the southern tips of the [[Patagonia]]. European culture, customs and government were introduced, with the Roman Catholic Church becoming the major economic and political power to overrule the traditional ways of the region, eventually becoming the only official religion of the Americas during this period.\n\n[[File:Imperios Espa\u00f1ol y Portugu\u00e9s 1790.svg|thumb|Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790.]]\n\nEpidemics of diseases brought by the Europeans, such as [[smallpox]] and [[measles]], wiped out a large portion of the indigenous population. Historians cannot determine the number of natives who died due to European diseases, but some put the figures as high as 85% and as low as 25%. Due to the lack of written records, specific numbers are hard to verify. Many of the survivors were forced to work in European plantations and mines. [[Miscegenation|Intermixing]] between the indigenous peoples and the European colonists was very common, and, by the end of the [[Colonialism|colonial period]], people of mixed ancestry ([[mestizo]]s) formed majorities in several colonies.\n\n====Slavery and forced labor in colonial Latin America====\n{{See also|Slavery among the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Atlantic slave trade}}\n{{see|Criollo people#Spanish colonial caste system{{!}}Society in the Spanish Colonial Americas}}\n\nIndigenous peoples of the Americas in various European colonies were forced to work in European plantations and mines; along with African slaves who were also introduced in the proceeding centuries.\n\nThe Mita of Colonial Latin America was a system of forced labor imposed on the natives. First established by Viceroy Francisco de Toledo (1569\u20131581), the Mita was upheld by laws that designated how large draft levies were and how much money the workers would receive that was based on how many shifts each individual worker performed. Toledo established Mitas at Potosi and Huancavelica, where the Mitayos\u2014the workers\u2014would be reduced in number to a fraction of how many were originally assigned before the 1700s. While several villages managed to resist the Mita, others offered payment to colonial administrators as a way out. In exchange, free labor became available through volunteers, though the Mita was kept in place as workers like miners, for example, were paid low wages. The Spanish Crown had not made any ruling on the Mita or approved of it when Toledo first established it in spite of the uncertainty of the practice since the Crown could have gained benefits from it. However, the cortes of Spain later abolished it in 1812 once complaints of the Mita violating humanitarian rights were made. Yet complaints also came from: governors; landowners; native leaders known as Kurakas; and even priests, each of whom preferred other methods of economic exploitation. Despite its fall, the Mita made it to the 1800s.<ref>Brown, K. W. (2008). Mita. In J. Kinsbruner & E. D. Langer (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture (2nd ed., Vol. 4, pp. 635\u2013636). Detroit: Charles Scribner's Sons.</ref>\n\nAnother important group of slaves to mention were the slaves brought over from Africa. The first slaves came over with Christopher Columbus from the very beginning on his earliest voyages. However in the few hundred years, the Atlantic Slave trade would begin delivering slaves, imported by Spain and other colonizers, by the millions. Many of the large scale productions were run by forced slave labor. They were a part of sugar and coffee production, farming (beans, rice, corn, fruit, etc.), Mining, whale oil and multiple other jobs. Slaves were also house workers, servants, military soldiers, and much more. To say the least these people were property and treated as such. Though indigenous slaves existed, they were no match in quantity and lack of quality jobs when compared to the African slave. The slave population was massive compared to the better known slave ownership in the United States. After 1860 Brazil alone had imported over 4 million slaves, which only represented about 35% of the Atlantic slave trade. Despite the large number of slaves in Latin America, there was not as much reproduction of slaves amongst the population. Because most of the slaves then were African-born, they were more subject to rebellion. The United States involvement in the slave trade is well known amongst North America, however it hides a larger and in some ways crueler operation in the south which had a much longer history.{{sfnp|Meade|2016|pp=53\u201357}}\n\n===Independence (1804\u20131825)===\n{{Main|Latin American wars of independence|Spanish American wars of independence}}\n[[File:Bolivar Arturo Michelena.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.70|[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]], Liberator of [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]] and [[Panama]]]]\n\nIn 1804, Haiti became the first Latin American nation to gain independence, following a violent slave revolt led by [[Toussaint L'ouverture]] on the French colony of [[Saint-Domingue]]. The victors abolished slavery. Haitian independence inspired independence movements in Spanish America.\n[[File:Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla.png|thumbnail|right|upright=0.70|[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] was the first leader of the [[Mexican War of Independence]].]]\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, Spanish and Portuguese power waned on the global scene as other European powers took their place, notably Britain and France. Resentment grew among the majority of the population in Latin America over the restrictions imposed by the Spanish government, as well as the dominance of native Spaniards (Iberian-born ''[[Peninsulares]]'') in the major social and political [[institution]]s. [[Napoleon]]'s invasion of Spain in 1808 marked a turning point, compelling [[Criollo people|Criollo]] elites to form [[junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]] that advocated independence. Also, the newly independent [[Haiti]], the second oldest nation in the [[New World]] after the United States, further fueled the independence movement by inspiring the leaders of the movement, such as [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] of Mexico, [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] of Venezuela and [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and by providing them with considerable munitions and troops.\n\nFighting soon broke out between juntas and the Spanish colonial authorities, with initial victories for the advocates of independence. Eventually, these early movements were crushed by the [[Royalist (Hispanic American Revolution)|royalist troops]] by 1810, including those of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]] in [[Mexico]] in the year 1810. Later on [[Francisco de Miranda]] in [[Venezuela]] by 1812. Under the leadership of a new generation of leaders, such as [[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] \"The Liberator\", [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] of Argentina, and other ''[[Libertadores]]'' in South America, the independence movement regained strength, and by 1825, all [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]], except for Puerto Rico and Cuba, had gained independence from Spain. In the same year in [[Mexico]], a military officer, [[Agust\u00edn de Iturbide]], led a coalition of conservatives and liberals who created a [[constitutional monarchy]], with Iturbide as [[emperor]]. This [[First Mexican Empire]] was short-lived, and was followed by the creation of a [[republic]] in 1823.\n\n====Independent Empire of Brazil====\n{{Main|Independence of Brazil|Empire of Brazil}}\n[[File:Independence of Brazil 1888.jpg|upright=1.25|thumb|left|Declaration of the [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazilian independence]] by the later [[Pedro I of Brazil|Emperor Pedro&nbsp;I]] on September 7, 1822]]\n\nThe [[Brazilian War of Independence]], which had already begun along other independent movements around the region, spread through northern, northeastern regions and in Cisplatina province.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;168, 164, 178</ref> With the last Portuguese soldiers surrendering on 8 March 1824,<ref name=\"Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp. 179\u2013180\">Di\u00e9gues 2004, pp.&nbsp;179\u2013180</ref> Portugal officially recognized Brazil on 29 August 1825.<ref name=\"Lustosa, p. 208\">Lustosa, p.&nbsp;208</ref>\n\n[[File:Pedro Am\u00e9rico - D.

''El liberalismo hispanoamericano'' en el siglo XIX. pg2</ref> Conservatism was the dominant system of government prior to the revolutions and it was founded on having social classes, including governing by kings. Liberalists wanted to see a change in the ruling systems, and to move away from monarchs and social classes in order to promote equality.\n\nWhen liberal [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of Mexico in 1824, conservatists relied on their belief that the state had been better off before the new government came into power, so, by comparison, the old government was better in the eyes of the Conservatives. Following this sentiment, the conservatives pushed to take control of the government, and they succeeded. [[General Santa Anna]] was elected president in 1833. The following decade, the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] (1846\u201348) caused Mexico to lose a significant amount of territory to the United States. This loss led to a rebellion by the enraged liberal forces against the conservative government.\n\nIn 1837, conservative [[Rafael Carrera]] conquered [[Guatemala]] and separated from the [[Central American Union]]. The instability that followed the disintegration of the union led to the independence of the other Central American countries.\n\nIn [[Brazil]], rural aristocrats were in conflict with the urban conservatives. Portuguese control over Brazilian ports continued after Brazil's independence. Following the conservative idea that the old government was better, urbanites tended to support conservatism because more opportunities were available to them as a result of the Portuguese presence.\n\n[[Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar]] became president of [[Gran Colombia]] in 1819 after the region gained independence from Spain. He led a military-controlled state. Citizens did not like the government's position under Bol\u00edvar: The people in the military were unhappy with their roles, and the civilians were of the opinion that the military had too much power. After the dissolution of Gran Colombia, New Grenada continued to have conflicts between conservatives and liberals. These conflicts were each concentrated in particular regions, with conservatives particularly in the southern mountains and the Valley of Cauca. In the mid-1840s some leaders in Caracas organized a liberal opposition. Antonio Leocadio Guzman was an active participant and journalist in this movement and gained much popularity among the people of Caracas.<ref>Halper\u00edn Donghi, T. (2013). ''Historia contempor\u00e1nea de Am\u00e9rica latina''. Madrid: Alianza.</ref>\n\nIn [[Argentina]], the conflict manifested itself as a prolonged civil war between ''[[Unitarian Party|unitarianas]]'' (i.e. ''centralists'') and ''[[Federales|federalists]]'', which were in some aspects respectively analogous to liberals and conservatives in other countries. Between 1832 and 1852, the country existed as a [[Argentine Confederation|confederation]], without a head of state, although the federalist governor of Buenos Aires province, [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]], was given the powers of debt payment and international relations and exerted a growing hegemony over the country. A national constitution was only enacted in 1853, reformed in 1860, and the country reorganized as a federal republic led by a [[Generation of '80|liberal-conservative elite]].<ref>Galasso, N. (2011). ''Historia de la Argentina'' (Vol. 1).</ref> After Uruguay achieved its independence, in 1828, a similar polarization crystallized between ''blancos'' and ''colorados'', where the agrarian conservative interests were pitted against the liberal commercial interests based in Montevideo, and which eventually resulted in the ''[[Uruguayan Civil War|Guerra Grande]]'' civil war (1839\u20131851).<ref>Hudson, R., & Meditz, S.

The British were able to capture large amounts of precious metals, before a French naval force intervened on behalf of the Spanish King and took down the invading force. However, this caused much turmoil in the area as militia took control of the area from the viceroy. The next year the British attacked once again with a much larger force attempting to reach and conquer Montevideo.<ref>Donghi, 89</ref> They failed to reach [[Montevideo]] but succeeded in establishing an alliance with the locals.

On May 8, 1827 Baron Damas, the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Sebasti\u00e1n Camacho, a Mexican diplomat, signed an agreement called \"The Declarations\" which contained provisions regarding commerce and navigation between France and Mexico.

However, the constant state of warfare left Mexico with a tremendous amount of debt owed to Spain, England, and France, all of whom funded the Mexican war effort (Neeno). As newly appointed president, Benito Ju\u00e1rez suspended payment of debts for next two years, to focus on a rebuilding and stabilization initiative in Mexico under the new government. On December 8, 1861, Spain, England and France landed in Veracruz in order to seize unpaid debts from Mexico. However, Napoleon III, with intentions of establishing a French client state to further push his economic interests, pressured the other two powers to withdraw in 1862 (Greenspan; \"French Intervention in Mexico\u2026\").\n[[File:Batalla de Puebla.png|upright=0.80|thumb|right|Painting depicting the [[Battle of Puebla]] in 1862]]\nFrance under Napoleon III remained and established Maximilian of Habsburg, Archduke of Austria, as Emperor of Mexico.<ref>{{cite web|title=French Intervention in Mexico and the American Civil War, 1862\u20131867|url=https://history.state.gov/milestones/1861-1865/french-intervention |website=U.S Department of State Office of the Historian}}</ref> The march by the French to Mexico City enticed heavy resistance by the Mexican government, it resulted in open warfare. The Battle of Puebla in 1862 in particular presented an important turning point in which Ignacio Zaragoza led the Mexican army to victory as they pushed back the French offensive (\"Timeline of the Mexican Revolution\"). The victory came to symbolize Mexico's power and national resolve against foreign occupancy and as a result delayed France's later attack on Mexico City for an entire year (Cinco de Mayo (Mexican History)). With heavy resistance by Mexican rebels and the fear of United States intervention against France, forced Napoleon III to withdraw from Mexico, leaving Maximilian to surrender, where he would be later executed by Mexican troops under the rule of Porfirio D\u00edaz.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ridge Jr.|first1=Michael Allen|title=A country in need of American instruction : The U.S. mission to shape and transform Mexico, 1848\u20131911|url=http://ir.uiowa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3321&context=etd|website=Iowa Research Online|publisher=University of Iowa}}</ref> Napoleon III's desire to expand France's economic empire influenced the decision to seize territorial domain over the Central American region. The port city of Veracruz, Mexico and France's desire to construct a new canal were of particular interest. Bridging both New World and East Asian trade routes to the Atlantic were key to Napoleon III's economic goals to the mining of precious rocks and the expansion of France's textile industry. Napoleon's fear of the United States' economic influence over the Pacific trade region, and in turn all New World economic activity, pushed France to intervene in Mexico under the pretense of collecting on Mexico's debt. Eventually France began plans to build the Panama Canal in 1881 until 1904 when the United States took over and proceeded with its construction and implementation (\"Read Our Story\").\n\n===American involvement in Latin America during the 19th century===\n\n====Monroe Doctrine====\n[[File:Roosevelt monroe Doctrine cartoon.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|Political cartoon depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] using the [[Monroe Doctrine]] to keep European powers out of the [[Dominican Republic]]]]\nThe [[Monroe Doctrine]] was included in President [[James Monroe]]'s 1823 annual message to Congress. The doctrine warns European nations that the United States will no longer tolerate any new colonization of Latin American countries. It was originally drafted to meet the present major concerns, but eventually became the precept of U.S. foreign policy in the Western Hemisphere. The doctrine was put into effect in 1865 when the U.S. government supported Mexican president, [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], diplomatically and militarily. Some Latin American countries viewed the U.S. interventions, allowed by the Monroe Doctrine when the U.S. deems necessary, with suspicion.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. ''A History of Latin America''. pg 491</ref>\n\nAnother important aspect of United States involvement in Latin America is the case of the [[Filibuster (military)|filibuster]] [[William Walker (filibuster)|William Walker]]. In 1855, he traveled to Nicaragua hoping to overthrow the government and take the land for the United States. With only the aid of 56 followers, he was able to take over the city of [[Granada, Nicaragua|Granada]], declaring himself commander of the army and installing [[Patricio Rivas]] as a puppet president. However, Rivas's presidency ended when he fled Nicaragua; Walker rigged the following election to ensure that he became the next president. His presidency did not last long, however, as he was met with much opposition from political groups in Nicaragua and neighbouring countries. On May 1, 1857, Walker was forced by a coalition of Central American armies to surrender himself to a United States Navy officer who repatriated him and his followers. When Walker subsequently returned to Central America in 1860, he was apprehended by the Honduran authorities and executed.\n\n====Mexican\u2013American War (1846\u201348)====\n[[File:Mexico nebel.jpg|thumb|left|American occupation of [[Mexico City]]]]\n\nThe [[Mexican\u2013American War]], another instance of U.S. involvement in Latin America, was a war between the United States and Mexico that started in April 1846 and lasted until February 1848. The main cause of the war was the United States' annexation of Texas in 1845 and a dispute afterwards about whether the border between Mexico and the United States ended where Mexico claimed, at the [[Nueces River]], or ended where the United States claimed, at the [[Rio Grande]]. Peace was negotiated between the United States and Mexico with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which stated that Mexico was to cede land which would later become part of California and New Mexico as well as give up all claims to Texas, for which the United States would pay $15,000,000. However, tensions between the two countries were still high and over the next six years things only got worse with raids along the border and attacks by Native Americans against Mexican citizens. To defuse the situation, the United States agreed to purchase 29,670 squares miles of land from Mexico for $10,000,000 so a southern railroad could be built to connect the Pacific and Atlantic coasts. This would become known as the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. A critical component of U.S. intervention in Latin American affairs took form in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], which drastically affected the futures of Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Americas, as well as Guam and the Philippines, by dismantling some of the last remaining Spanish colonial possessions throughout the world.\n\n==From the \"Big Stick\" to the \"Good Neighbor\" policy==\n[[File:Satterfield cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic.jpg|thumb|[[Bob Satterfield (cartoonist)|Bob Satterfield]] cartoon about constant revolutions in the Dominican Republic]]\nIn the late 19th century and early 20th century, the U.S. banana importing companies [[United Fruit Company]], [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]] (both ancestors of [[Chiquita Brands International|Chiquita]]), and [[Standard Fruit Company]] (now [[Dole Food Company|Dole]]), acquired large amounts of land in Central American countries like Guatemala, Honduras, and Costa Rica.

The proposal was intercepted and decoded by British intelligence. The revelation of the contents outraged the American public and swayed public opinion. President [[Woodrow Wilson]] moved to arm American merchant ships in order to defend themselves against German submarines, which had started to attack them. The news helped generate support for the [[American entry into World War I|United States declaration of war on Germany]] in April of that year.<ref>[[#Andrew|Andrew]], p.&nbsp;42.</ref>\n\nThe message came as a [[code (cryptography)|coded]] telegram dispatched by the Foreign Secretary of the German Empire, [[Arthur Zimmermann]], on January 16, 1917. The message was sent to the German ambassador of Mexico, [[Heinrich von Eckardt]]. Zimmermann sent the telegram in anticipation of the [[Atlantic U-boat campaign of World War I#1917: Renewed \"unrestricted\" campaign|resumption of unrestricted submarine warfare]] by Germany on 1 February, an act which Germany presumed would lead to war. The telegram instructed Ambassador Eckardt that if the U.S. appeared certain to enter the war, he was to approach the Mexican Government with a proposal for a military alliance, with funding from Germany. As part of the alliance, Germany would assist Mexico in reconquering Texas and the Southwest. Eckardt was instructed to urge Mexico to help broker an alliance between Germany and Japan. Mexico, in the middle of the [[Mexican Revolution]], far weaker militarily, economically and politically than the U.S., ignored the proposal; after the U.S. entered the war, it officially rejected it.\n\n====Brazil's participation in World War II====\nAfter World War I, in which Brazil was an ally of the [[United States]], [[Great Britain]], and [[France]], the country realized it needed a more capable army but did not have the technology to create it. In 1919, the French Military Mission was established by the French Commission in Brazil. Their main goal was to contain the inner rebellions in Brazil. They tried to assist the army by bringing them up to the European military standard but constant civil missions did not prepare them for [[World War II]].\n\nBrazil's President, [[Get\u00falio Vargas]], wanted to industrialize Brazil, allowing it to be more competitive with other countries. He reached out to Germany, Italy, France, and the United States to act as trade allies. Many Italian and German people immigrated to Brazil many years before World War II began thus creating a Nazi influence. The immigrants held high positions in government and the armed forces. It was recently found that 9,000 war criminals escaped to South America, including Croats, Ukrainians, Russians and other western Europeans who aided the Nazi war machine. Most, perhaps as many as 5,000, went to Argentina; between 1,500 and 2,000 are thought to have made it to Brazil; around 500 to 1,000 to Chile; and the rest to Paraguay and Uruguay.<ref>{{cite news|title=Secret Files Reveal 9,000 Nazi War Criminals Fled to South America after WWII|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2117093/Secret-files-reveal-9-000-Nazi-war-criminals-fled-South-America-WWII.html|newspaper=Mail Online|accessdate=24 May 2012|location=London|first=Allan|last=Hall|date=2012-03-19}}</ref> It was not a secret that Vargas had an admiration for Hitler's Nazi Germany and its F\u00fchrer. He even let German Luftwaffe build secret air forces around Brazil.\nThis alliance with Germany became Brazil's second best trade alliance behind the United States.\n\n[[File:Massarosaw.jpg|right|thumb|Brazilian soldiers greet Italian civilians in the city of [[Massarosa]], September 1944. Brazil was the only independent Latin American country to send ground troops to fight in WWII.]]\n\nBrazil continued to try to remain neutral to the United States and Germany because it was trying to make sure it could continue to be a place of interest for both opposing countries. Brazil attended continental meetings in Buenos Aires, Argentina (1936); Lima, Peru (1938); and Havana, Cuba (1940) that obligated them to agree to defend any part of the Americas if they were to be attacked. Eventually, Brazil decided to stop trading with Germany once Germany started attacking offshore trading ships resulting in Germany declaring a blockade against the Americas in the Atlantic Ocean. Furthermore, Germany also ensured that they would be attacking the Americas soon.\n\nOnce the German submarines attacked unarmed Brazilian trading ships, President Vargas met with the United States President Franklin D. Roosevelt to discuss how they could retaliate. On January 22, 1942, Brazil officially ended all relations with Germany, Japan, and Italy, becoming a part of the Allies.\n\nThe [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force]] was sent to Naples, Italy to fight for democracy. Brazil was the only Latin American country to send troops to Europe. Initially, Brazil wanted to only provide resources and shelter for the war to have a chance of gaining a high postwar status but ended up sending 25,000 men to fight.<ref>{{cite web|last=Penteado|first=Carlos Joes A.|title=Hyper War: The Brazilian Participation in World War II|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/UN/Brazil/Participation/index.html|accessdate=24 May 2012}}</ref>\n\nAfter World War II, the United States and Latin America continued to have a close relationship.

BBC News. 24 January 2008.</ref>]]\n\nThe Great Depression caused Latin America to grow at a slow rate, separating it from leading industrial democracies. The two world wars and U.S. Depression also made Latin American countries favor internal economic development, leading Latin America to adopt the policy of [[import substitution industrialization]].<ref name=\"History of Latin America\">{{cite web|title=History of Latin America|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref> Countries also renewed emphasis on exports. Brazil began selling automobiles to other countries, and some Latin American countries set up plants to assemble imported parts, letting other countries take advantage of Latin America's low labor costs. Colombia began to export flowers, emeralds and coffee grains and gold, becoming the world's second-leading flower exporter.\n\nEconomic integration was called for, to attain economies that could compete with the economies of the United States or Europe. Starting in the 1960s with the Latin American Free Trade Association and Central American Common Market, Latin American countries worked toward economic integration.\n\nIn efforts to help regain global economic strength, the U.S. began to heavily assist countries involved in World War II at the expense of Latin America. Markets that were previously unopposed as a result of the war in Latin America grew stagnant as the rest of the world no longer needed their goods.\n\n====Reforms====\nLarge countries like Argentina called for reforms to lessen the disparity of wealth between the rich and the poor, which has been a long problem in Latin America that stunted economic growth.<ref name=\"Kaufman\">{{cite web|last=Kaufman|first=Robert|title=The Political Effects of Inequality: Some Inconvenient Facts|publisher=Rutgers University}}</ref>\n\nAdvances in public health caused an explosion of population growth, making it difficult to provide social services. Education expanded, and social security systems introduced, but benefits usually went to the middle class, not the poor. As a result, the disparity of wealth increased. Increasing inflation and other factors caused countries to be unwilling to fund social development programs to help the poor.\n\n====Bureaucratic authoritarianism====\nBureaucratic authoritarianism was practised in Brazil after 1964, in Argentina, and in Chile under Augusto Pinochet, in a response to harsh economic conditions. It rested on the conviction that no democracy could take the harsh measures to curb inflation, reassure investors, and quicken economic growth quickly and effectively.

The United States imposed a trade embargo on Cuba, and combined with Castro's expropriation of private enterprises, this was detrimental to the Cuban economy.<ref name=\"History of Latin America\" /> Around Latin America, rural guerrilla conflict and urban terrorism increased, inspired by the Cuban example. The United States put down these rebellions by supporting Latin American countries in their counter-guerrilla operations through the Alliance for Progress launched by President John F. Kennedy. This thrust appeared to be successful. A Marxist, Salvador Allende, became president of Chile in 1970, but was overthrown three years later in a military coup backed by the United States. Despite civil war, high crime and political instability, most Latin American countries eventually adopted bourgeois liberal democracies while Cuba maintained its socialist system.\n\n====Bay of Pigs Invasion====\n{{Main|Bay of Pigs Invasion}}\n\n[[Image:Attack near Playa Giron.

The incident proved to be very embarrassing for the new Kennedy administration.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Bay of Pigs Invasion|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica}}</ref>\n\nThe failure of the invasion led to a [[Cuba\u2013Soviet Union relations|Soviet-Cuban alliance]].\n\n====Cuban Missile Crisis====\n{{Main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}\nIn 1962, Cuba threatened the USA when it allowed Soviet missiles to be placed on the island, just 90 miles away from Florida; Cuba saw it as a way to defend the island, while the Americans saw it as a threat. The ensuing Cuban Missile Crisis\u2014the closest the world has ever come to total annihilation\u2014almost saw a US invasion or bombing of Cuba, but it ended when the two sides agreed on the removal of missiles; the US removed theirs from Italy and Turkey, while the Soviets removed theirs from Cuba. The crisis' end left Cuba blockaded by the US, which was also obligated to not invade Cuba. In fact, they were allowed to keep [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base|Guantanamo Bay]] as a naval base as per an agreement with the previous government of Batista.\n\n====Alliance for Progress====\nPresident John F. Kennedy initiated the [[Alliance for Progress]] in 1961, to establish economic cooperation between the U.S. and Latin America. The Alliance would provide $20 billion for reform in Latin America, and counterinsurgency measures.

The era of Somoza family rule was characterized by strong U.S. support for the government and its military as well as a heavy reliance on U.S.-based multi-national corporations. The Nicaraguan Revolution (Spanish: Revoluci\u00f3n Nicarag\u00fcense or Revoluci\u00f3n Popular Sandinista) encompassed the rising opposition to the Somoza dictatorship in the 1960s and 1970s, the campaign led by the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) to violently oust the dictatorship in 1978\u201379, the subsequent efforts of the FSLN to govern Nicaragua from 1979 until 1990 and the [[Nicaraguan Revolution#Contra War|Contra War]] which was waged between the FSLN and the [[Contras]] from 1981\u20131990.\n\nThe Revolution marked a significant period in Nicaraguan history and revealed the country as one of the major proxy war battlegrounds of the Cold War with the events in the country rising to international attention. Although the initial overthrow of the Somoza regime in 1978\u201379 was a bloody affair, the Contra War of the 1980s took the lives of tens of thousands of Nicaraguans and was the subject of fierce international debate.<ref>Bakewell, Peter. A history of Latin America. pg541-542</ref> During the 1980s both the FSLN (a leftist collection of political parties) and the Contras (a rightist collection of counter-revolutionary groups) received large amounts of aid from the Cold War super-powers (respectively, the Soviet Union and the United States).\n\n===Washington Consensus===\n{{Main|Washington Consensus}}\n{{See also|Free Trade Area of the Americas}}\n[[File:Ship passing through Panama Canal 01.jpg|right|thumb|[[Roll-on/roll-off]]\nships, such as this one pictured here at [[Miraflores (Panama)|Miraflores locks]], are among the largest ships to pass through the [[Panama Canal]].

(Other Latin countries with governments of the left, including Brazil, Mexico, Chile and Peru, have in practice adopted the bulk of the policies.) Also critical of the policies as actually promoted by the International Monetary Fund have been some US economists, such as [[Joseph Stiglitz]] and [[Dani Rodrik]], who have challenged what are sometimes described as the \"fundamentalist\" policies of the International Monetary Fund and the US Treasury for what Stiglitz calls a \"one size fits all\" treatment of individual economies.\n\nThe term has become associated with neoliberal policies in general and drawn into the broader debate over the expanding role of the free market, constraints upon the state, and US influence on other countries' national sovereignty.\n\nThis politico-economical initiative was institutionalized in North America by 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]], and elsewhere in the Americas through a series of [[Free Trade Area of the Americas#Agreements|like agreements]].

A development of this has been the creation of the eight-member ALBA alliance, or \"[[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|The Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of Our America]]\" (Spanish: ''Alianza Bolivariana para los Pueblos de Nuestra Am\u00e9rica'') by some of the countries already mentioned.

A \"reversal of development\" reigned over Latin America, seen through negative economic growth, declines in industrial production, and thus, falling living standards for the middle and lower classes.<ref>{{cite book|editor-last=Escobar|editor-first=Arturo|editor-first2=Sonia E.|editor-last2=Alvarez|title=The Making of Social Movements in Latin America|location=Boulder, CO|publisher=Westview|date=1992}}</ref> Governments made financial security their primary policy goal over social security, enacting new neoliberal economic policies that implemented privatization of previously national industries and [[Informal sector|informalization]] of labor.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> In an effort to bring more investors to these industries, these governments also embraced [[globalization]] through more open interactions with the international economy.\n\nSignificantly, as democracy spread across much of Latin America, the realm of government became more inclusive (a trend that proved conducive to social movements), the economic ventures remained exclusive to a few elite groups within society. Neoliberal restructuring consistently redistributed income upward while denying political responsibility to provide social welfare rights, and though [[Development studies|development]] projects took place throughout the region, both inequality and poverty increased.<ref name=\"Hershberg & Rosen\" /> Feeling excluded from these new projects, the lower classes took ownership of their own democracy through a revitalization of social movements in Latin America.\n\nBoth urban and rural populations had serious grievances as a result of the above economic and global trends and have voiced them in mass demonstrations. Some of the largest and most violent of these have been protests against cuts in urban services, such as the [[Caracazo]] in Venezuela and the [[Argentinazo]] in Argentina.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\">Johnston, Hank, and Paul Almeida, eds.

These movements have benefited considerably from transnational support from conservationists and [[International nongovernmental organizations|INGOs]]. The [[Landless Workers' Movement|Movement of Rural Landless Workers]] (MST) is perhaps the largest contemporary Latin American social movement.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> As indigenous populations are primarily rural, indigenous movements account for a large portion of rural social movements, including the [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation|Zapatista rebellion]] in Mexico, the [[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador]] ([[Confederation of Indigenous Nationalities of Ecuador|CONAIE]]), indigenous organizations in the Amazon region of Ecuador and Bolivia, pan-Mayan communities in Guatemala, and mobilization by the indigenous groups of [[Yanomami]] peoples in the Amazon, [[Guna people|Kuna]] peoples in Panama, and Altiplano [[Aymara people|Aymara]] and [[Quechua people|Quechua]] peoples in Bolivia.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" /> Other significant types of social movements include labor struggles and strikes, such as [[recovered factories]] in Argentina, as well as gender-based movements such as the [[Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo]] in Argentina and protests against [[maquila]] production, which is largely a women's issue because of how it draws on women for cheap labor.<ref name=\"Johnston & Almeida\" />\n\n===Modern era===\nThe [[2000s commodities boom]] caused positive effects for many Latin American economies.

In the Spanish and Portuguese empires, racial mixing or miscegenation was the norm and something that the Spanish and Portuguese had grown rather accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans in the Iberian peninsula. But, demographics may have made this inevitable as well. Thus, for example, of the approximately 13.5 million people who lived in the Spanish colonies in 1800 before independence only about one fifth were white. This contrasts with the U.S., where more than four fifths were whites (out of a population of 5.3 million in 1801, 900,000 were slaves, plus approximately 60,000 free blacks). ...\n\nThe fact of the recognition of a racial continuum in Hispanic American (sic) does not mean that there wasn't discrimination, which there was, or that there wasn't an obsession with race, or 'castes', as they were sometimes called. ...\n\nIn areas with large indigenous Amerindian populations, a racial mixture resulted, which is known in Spanish as ''mestizos'' ... who are a majority in Mexico, Central America and most of South America. Similarly, when African slaves were brought to the Caribbean region and Brazil, where there was very little indigenous presence left, unions between them and Spanish produced a population of mixed ''mulatos'' ... who are a majority of the population in many of those Spanish-speaking Caribbean basin countries (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, Colombia, and Venezuela). \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/race.htm|title=Hispanics and Race|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nAske has also written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Spanish colonization was rather different from later English, or British, colonization of North America. They had different '''systems of colonization''' and different methods of subjugation. While the English were primarily interested in grabbing land, the Spanish in addition had a mandate to incorporate the land's inhabitants into their society, something which was achieved by religious conversion and sexual unions which produced a new 'race' of ''mestizos'', a mixture of Europeans and indigenous peoples. ''mestizos'' (sic) form the majority of the population in Mexico, Central America, and much of South America. Racial mixing or miscegenation, after all, was something that the Spanish and Portuguese had been accustomed to during the hundreds of years of contact with Arabs and North Africans.\n\nSimilarly, later on, when African slaves were introduced into the Caribbean basin region, unions between them and Spaniards produced a population of ''mulatos'', who are a majority of the population in the Caribbean islands (the Antilles) (Cuba, Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico), as well as other areas of the Caribbean region (Colombia, Venezuela and parts of the Central American Caribbean coast). ''mestizos'' (sic) and ''mulatos'' may not have always have been first class citizens in their countries, but they were never disowned in the way the outcomes of unions of Europeans and Native Americans were in the British colonies, where interracial marriages were taboo and one drop of Black or Amerindian blood was enough to make the person 'impure'. \n}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://lrc.salemstate.edu/hispanics/history.htm|title=Some historical background|first=Jon|last=Aske}}</ref>\n\nIn his famous 1963 book ''[[The Rise of the West]]'', [[William Hardy McNeill]] wrote that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=Racially mixed societies arose in most of Spanish and Portuguese America, compounded in varying proportions from European, Indian, and Negro strands. Fairly frequent resort to manumission mitigated the hardships of slavery in those areas; and the Catholic church positively encouraged marriages between white immigrants and Indian women as a remedy for sexual immorality. However, in the southern English colonies and in most of the Caribbean islands, the importation of Negro slaves created a much more sharply polarized biracial society. Strong race feeling and the servile status of nearly all Negroes interdicted intermarriage, practically if not legally. Such discrimination did not prevent interbreeding; but children of mixed parentage were assigned to the status of their mothers. Mulattoes and Indian half-breeds were thereby excluded from the white community. In Spanish (and, with some differences, Portuguese) territories a more elaborate and less oppressive principle of racial discrimination established itself. The handful of persons who had been born in the homelands claimed topmost social prestige; next came those of purely European descent; while beneath ranged the various racial blends to form a social pyramid whose numerous racial distinctions meant that no one barrier could become as ugly and inpenetrable as that dividing whites from Negroes in the English, Dutch, and French colonies.\n}}<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rise of the West: A History of the Human Community|last=McNeill|first=William H.|year=1991|publisher=The University of Chicago Press}}, p. 603</ref>\n\nThomas C. Wright, meanwhile, has written that:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The demographic makeup of colonial Latin America became more complex when, as the native population declined, the Portuguese, Spanish, and the French in Haiti turned to Africa for labor, as did the British in North America. The tricontinental heritage that characterizes Latin America, then, is shared by the United States, but even a casual examination reveals that the outcome of the complex interaction of different peoples has varied. While miscegenation among the three races certainly occurred in North America, it appears to have been much less common than in Latin America. Furthermore, offspring of such liaisons were not recognized as belonging to new, distinct racial categories in North America as they were in Latin America. The terms mestizo or ''mameluco'', mulatto, the general term ''castas'', and dozens of subcategories of racial identity frankly recognized the outcomes of interracial sexual activity in Latin America and established a continuum of race rather than the unrealistic absolute categories of white, black, or Indian as used in the United States.

Spanish in green, Portuguese in orange, and French in blue.]]\n\n[[Spanish language|Spanish]] is the predominant language of Latin America. It is spoken as first language by about 60% of the population. Portuguese is spoken by about 34%, and about 6% speak other languages such as Quechua, [[Mayan languages]], Guaran\u00ed, Aymara, Nahuatl, English, French, Dutch and Italian. Portuguese is spoken only in Brazil ([[Brazilian Portuguese]]), the biggest and most populous country in the region. Spanish is the official language of most of the rest of the countries and territories on the Latin American mainland ([[Spanish language in the Americas]]), as well as in [[Cuba]], [[Puerto Rico]] (where it is co-official with English), and the [[Dominican Republic]]. [[French language|French]] is spoken in [[Haiti]] and in the French [[overseas department]]s of [[Guadeloupe]], [[Martinique]] and [[French Guiana|Guiana]], and the French [[overseas collectivity]] of [[Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]; it is also spoken by some Panamanians of Afro-Antillean descent. [[Dutch language|Dutch]] is the official language in [[Suriname]], [[Aruba]], [[Cura\u00e7ao]], and the [[Netherlands Antilles]]. (As Dutch is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]], these territories are not necessarily considered part of Latin America.) However, the native language of Aruba, [[Bonaire]], and Cura\u00e7ao, is [[Papiamento]], a creole language largely based on Portuguese and Spanish and has a considerable influence coming from the Dutch language and [[Portuguese-based creole languages]].\n\n[[File:Map-Most Widely Spoken Native Languages in Latin America.png|thumb|'''{{color|blue|Quechua}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#f9dc38|Guaran\u00ed}}}}''', '''{{background color|black|{{color|#ff9922|Aymara}}}}''', '''{{color|#cc0000|N\u00e1huatl}}''', '''{{color|#006600|Lenguas Mayas}}''', '''Mapudungun''']]\n\n[[Indigenous languages of the Americas|Amerindian languages]] are widely spoken in [[Peru]], [[Guatemala]], [[Bolivia]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Mexico]], and to a lesser degree, in [[Panama]], [[Ecuador]], [[Brazil]], [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Argentina]], and [[Chile]] amongst other countries. In Latin American countries not named above, the population of speakers of indigenous languages tend to be very small or even non-existent (e.g. [[Uruguay]]). Mexico is possibly the only country that contains a wider variety of indigenous languages than any Latin American country, but the most spoken language is Nahuatl.\n\nIn [[Peru]], [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] is an official language, alongside Spanish and any other indigenous language in the areas where they predominate. In [[Ecuador]], while holding no official status, the closely related [[Quichua]] is a recognized language of the indigenous people under the country's constitution; however, it is only spoken by a few groups in the country's highlands. In [[Bolivia]], [[Aymara language|Aymara]], Quechua and Guaran\u00ed hold official status alongside Spanish. [[Guaran\u00ed language|Guaran\u00ed]], along with Spanish, is an official language of [[Paraguay]], and is spoken by a majority of the population (who are, for the most part, bilingual), and it is co-official with Spanish in the [[Argentina|Argentine]] province of [[Corrientes]]. In [[Nicaragua]], Spanish is the official language, but on the country's Caribbean coast English and indigenous languages such as [[Miskito language|Miskito]], [[Sumo languages|Sumo]], and [[Rama language|Rama]] also hold official status. [[Colombia]] recognizes all indigenous languages spoken within its territory as official, though fewer than 1% of its population are native speakers of these languages. [[Nahuatl]] is one of the 62 native languages spoken by indigenous people in Mexico, which are officially recognized by the government as \"national languages\" along with Spanish.\n\nOther European languages spoken in Latin America include: [[English language|English]], by some groups in [[Puerto Rico]], as well as in nearby countries that may or may not be considered Latin American, like [[Belize]] and [[Guyana]], and spoken by descendants of British settlers in Argentina & Chile; [[German language|German]], in southern [[Brazil]], southern [[Chile]], portions of [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Paraguay]]; [[Italian language|Italian]], in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and [[Uruguay]]; [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]] in southern Brazil and Argentina; and [[Welsh language|Welsh]], in southern Argentina.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1163503 |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2008-07-22 |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.1stclassargentina.com/tours/WelshImmigration.html|title=The Welsh Immigration to Argentina|work=1stclassargentina.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jeremy Howat |url=http://www.argbrit.org/Patagonia/patagonia_entry.htm |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Argbrit.org |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.patagonline.com/patagonia/destacados/peninsula-valdes/gaiman-trelew |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Patagonline.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.andesceltig.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Andesceltig.com |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170917174822/http://andesceltig.com/ |archive-date=2017-09-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.glaniad.com/ |title=Reference for Welsh language in southern Argentina, Welsh immigration to Patagonia |publisher=Glaniad.com |date= |accessdate=2013-04-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160808130811/http://www.glaniad.com/ |archive-date=2016-08-08 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] are possible to be heard around Buenos Aires and S\u00e3o Paulo especially.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Brazil.html#4 |title=Brazil \u2013 Modern-Day Community |publisher=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/ |year=2013 |accessdate=2013-12-22}}</ref> Non-European or Asian languages include [[Japanese language|Japanese]] in Brazil, Peru, Bolivia, and Paraguay, [[Korean language|Korean]] in Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile, [[Arabic language|Arabic]] in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Venezuela, and Chile, and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] throughout South America.\n\nIn several nations, especially in the Caribbean region, [[creole languages]] are spoken.

A report released in 2013 by the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs|UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] entitled ''Inequality Matters.

Minor blocs or trade agreements are the [[G3 Free Trade Agreement]], the [[Dominican Republic \u2013 Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (DR-CAFTA), the [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) and the [[Andean Community of Nations]] (CAN). However, major reconfigurations are taking place along opposing approaches to integration and trade; Venezuela has officially withdrawn from both the CAN and G3 and it has been formally admitted into the Mercosur (pending ratification from the Paraguayan legislature). The president-elect of Ecuador has manifested his intentions of following the same path. This bloc nominally opposes any Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with the United States, although Uruguay has manifested its intention otherwise.

It is the product of many diverse influences:\n\n* [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] cultures of the people who inhabited the continent prior to European Colonization. Ancient and very advanced civilizations developed their own political, social and religious systems. The [[Maya civilization|Mayas]], the [[Aztec]]s and the [[Inca civilization|Incas]] are examples of these. Indigenous legacies in music, dance, foods, arts and crafts, clothing, folk culture and traditions are very strong in Latin America. Linguistic effects on [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] are also marked, such as in terms like [[pampa]], [[taco]], [[tamale]], [[cacique]].\n* [[Western culture|Western civilization]], in particular the [[culture of Europe]], was brought mainly by the colonial powers{{spaced ndash}}the [[Spanish people|Spanish]], [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] and [[French people|French]]{{spaced ndash}}between the 16th and 19th centuries. The most enduring European colonial influence is language and [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]]. More recently, additional cultural influences came from the United States and Europe during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, due to the growing influence of the former on the world stage and immigration from the latter. The influence of the United States is particularly strong in northern Latin America, especially Puerto Rico, which is an American territory. Prior to 1959, Cuba, who fought for its independence along American soldiers in the [[Spanish\u2013American War]], was also known to have a close socioeconomic relation with the United States. In addition, the United States also helped Panama become an independent state from Colombia and built the twenty-mile-long [[Panama Canal Zone]] in Panama which held from 1903 (the [[Panama Canal]] opened to transoceanic freight traffic in 1914) to 1999, when the [[Torrijos-Carter Treaties]] restored Panamanian control of the Canal Zone. South America experienced waves of immigration of Europeans, especially Italians, Spaniards, Portuguese, Germans, Austrians, Poles, Ukrainians, French, Dutch, Russians, Croatians, Lithuanians and Ashkenazi Jews. With the end of colonialism, [[Culture of France|French culture]] was also able to exert a direct influence in Latin America, especially in the realms of [[high culture]], science and medicine.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stepan|first=Nancy Leys |title=\"The Hour of Eugenics\": Race, Gender, and Nation in Latin America |publisher=Cornell University Press |year=1991 |location=Ithaca |pages=in passim |nopp=true |url=https://books.google.com/?id=NuUxkMC1ePYC |isbn=978-0-8014-9795-7}}</ref> This can be seen in any expression of the region's artistic traditions, including painting, literature and music, and in the realms of science and politics. \nDue to the impact of Enlightenment ideals after the French revolution, a certain number of Iberian-American countries decriminalized homosexuality after France and French territories in the Americas in 1791. Some of the countries that abolished sodomy laws or banned any reference to state interference in consensual adult sexuality in the 19th century were Dominican Republic (1822), Brazil (1824), Peru (1836), Mexico (1871), Paraguay (1880), Argentina (1887), Honduras (1899), Guatemala and El Salvador. Today same-sex marriage is legal in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Uruguay, and French overseas departments, as well as in several states of Mexico. Civil unions can be held in Chile.\n\n* [[Culture of Africa|African cultures]], whose presence derives from a long history of [[Atlantic slave trade|New World slavery]]. Peoples of African descent have influenced the ethno-scapes of Latin America and the Caribbean. This is manifested for instance in music, dance and religion, especially in countries like Brazil, Uruguay, Honduras, Puerto Rico, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Haiti, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, and Cuba.\n* [[Culture of Asia|Asian cultures]], whose part of the presence derives from the long history of the [[Coolie|Coolie trade]] mostly arriving during the 19th and 20th centuries, and most commonly Chinese workers in Peru and Venezuela.

In general, this artistic Eurocentrism began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge the uniqueness of their condition and started to follow their own path.\n\n[[File:Santiago Martinez Delgado in the colombian congress.jpg|thumb|right|Mural by [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] in the [[Colombian Congress]]]]\n\nFrom the early twentieth century, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by the [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist Movement]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Perez-Barreiro |first=Gabriel|date=December 1994|title=Constructivism in Latin America |journal=University of Essex Collection of Latin American Art|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The Movement quickly spread from Russia to Europe and then into Latin America.

Historically, the main centers of production have been Mexico, Argentina, Brazil, and Cuba.  Latin American film flourished after sound was introduced in cinema, which added a linguistic barrier to the export of Hollywood film south of the border.<ref>Paul A. Schroeder Rodriguez. ''Latin American Cinema: A Comparative History'' (University of California Press; 2016) studies 50 films since the silent era.</ref>\n[[File:Alejandro Inarritu Cannes 2017.jpg|right|upright|thumb|In 2015, [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] became the second Mexican director in a row to win both the [[Academy Award for Best Director|Academy Award]] and the [[Directors Guild of America Award]] for Best Director. He won his second [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] in 2016 for ''[[The Revenant (2015 film)|The Revenant]]''.]]\n\n[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican cinema]] started out in the silent era from 1896 to 1929 and flourished in the [[Golden age of the cinema of Mexico|Golden Era]] of the 1940s. It boasted a huge industry comparable to [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] at the time with stars such as [[Mar\u00eda F\u00e9lix]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], and [[Pedro Infante]]. In the 1970s, <!-- and 1970s --> Mexico was the location for many cult horror and action movies. More recently, films such as ''[[Amores Perros]]'' (2000) and ''[[Y tu mam\u00e1 tambi\u00e9n]]'' (2001) enjoyed box office and critical acclaim and propelled [[Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n]] and [[Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu]] to the front rank of Hollywood directors. Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez I\u00f1\u00e1rritu directed in 2010 ''[[Biutiful]]'' and [[Birdman (film)|''Birdman'']] (2014), Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n directed ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'' in 2004 and ''[[Gravity (2013 film)|Gravity]]'' (2013).  Close friend of both, [[Guillermo del Toro]], a top rank Hollywood director in Hollywood and Spain, directed ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' (2006) and produced ''[[The Orphanage (2007 film)|El Orfanato]]'' (2007). [[Carlos Carrera]] (''[[The Crime of Father Amaro (film)|The Crime of Father Amaro]])'', and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are also some of the most known present-day Mexican film makers. ''[[Rudo y Cursi]]'' released in December (2008) in Mexico was directed by [[Carlos Cuar\u00f3n]].\n[[File:Cristina, elenco y Oscar.jpg|left|thumb|President [[Cristina Fern\u00e1ndez]] with the film director [[Juan Jos\u00e9 Campanella]] and the cast of ''[[The Secret in Their Eyes]]'' (2009) with the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film]]]]\n\n[[Cinema of Argentina|Argentine cinema]] has also been prominenent since the first half of the 20th century and today averages over 60 full-length titles yearly. The industry suffered during the [[Proceso de Reorganizaci\u00f3n Nacional|1976\u20131983 military dictatorship]]; but re-emerged to produce the [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[The Official Story]]'' in 1985. A wave of imported U.S. films again damaged the industry in the early 1990s, though it soon recovered, thriving even during the [[Argentine economic crisis (1999-2002)|Argentine economic crisis]] around 2001. Many Argentine movies produced during recent years have been internationally acclaimed, including ''[[Nueve reinas]]'' (2000), ''[[Son of the Bride]]'' (2001), ''[[El abrazo partido]]'' (2004), ''[[El otro]]'' (2007), the 2010 Foreign Language [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] winner ''[[El secreto de sus ojos]]'' and ''[[Wild Tales (film)|Wild Tales]]'' (2014).\n\n[[Cinema of Brazil|In Brazil]], the ''[[Cinema Novo]]'' movement created a particular way of making movies with critical and intellectual screenplays, a clearer photography related to the light of the outdoors in a tropical landscape, and a political message. The modern Brazilian film industry has become more profitable inside the country, and some of its productions have received prizes and recognition in Europe and the United States, with movies such as ''[[Central do Brasil (film)|Central do Brasil]]'' (1999), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|Cidade de Deus]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tropa de Elite]]'' (2007).\n\n[[Cinema of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican cinema]] has produced some notable films, such as ''[[Una Aventura Llamada Menudo]]'', ''[[Los Diaz de Doris]]'' and ''[[Casi Casi]]''. An influx of Hollywood films affected the local film industry in Puerto Rico during the 1980s and 1990s, but several Puerto Rican films have been produced since and it has been recovering.\n\n[[Cinema of Cuba|Cuban cinema]] has enjoyed much official support since the [[Cuban revolution]] and important film-makers include [[Tom\u00e1s Guti\u00e9rrez Alea]].\n\n===Literature===\n{{Main|Latin American literature}}\n{{See also|List of Latin American writers}}\n\n[[File:Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz (1772).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] in 1772 by Andr\u00e9s de Islas]]\n[[File:Jorge Luis Borges Hotel.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Argentine [[Jorge Luis Borges]] in [[L'H\u00f4tel]], [[Paris]] in 1969]]\n\nPre-Columbian cultures were primarily oral, though the Aztecs and Mayans, for instance, produced elaborate [[Aztec codices|codices]]. Oral accounts of mythological and religious beliefs were also sometimes recorded after the arrival of European colonizers, as was the case with the [[Popol Vuh]]. Moreover, a tradition of oral narrative survives to this day, for instance among the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]]-speaking population of Peru and the [[K'iche' people|Quich\u00e9 (K'iche')]] of Guatemala.\n\nFrom the very moment of Europe's discovery of the continents, early explorers and [[conquistadores]] produced written accounts and cr\u00f3nicas of their experience{{spaced ndash}}such as [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]]'s letters or [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]]'s description of the conquest of Mexico. During the colonial period, written culture was often in the hands of the church, within which context [[Sor Juana In\u00e9s de la Cruz]] wrote memorable poetry and philosophical essays. Towards the end of the 18th Century and the beginning of the 19th, a distinctive [[Criollo (people)|criollo]] literary tradition emerged, including the first novels such as Lizardi's ''[[El Periquillo Sarniento]]'' (1816).\n\nThe 19th century was a period of \"foundational fictions\" (in critic Doris Sommer's words), novels in the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] or [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalist]] traditions that attempted to establish a sense of national identity, and which often focussed on the indigenous question or the dichotomy of \"civilization or barbarism\" (for which see, say, [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento|Domingo Sarmiento]]'s ''[[Facundo]]'' (1845), [[Juan Le\u00f3n Mera]]'s ''Cumand\u00e1'' (1879), or [[Euclides da Cunha]]'s ''[[Os Sert\u00f5es]]'' (1902)). The 19th century also witnessed the realist work of [[Machado de Assis]], who made use of surreal devices of metaphor and playful narrative construction, much admired by critic [[Harold Bloom]].\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, ''[[modernismo]]'' emerged, a poetic movement whose founding text was Nicaraguan poet [[Rub\u00e9n Dar\u00edo]]'s ''Azul'' (1888). This was the first Latin American literary movement to influence literary culture outside of the region, and was also the first truly Latin American literature, in that national differences were no longer so much at issue. [[Jos\u00e9 Mart\u00ed]], for instance, though a Cuban patriot, also lived in Mexico and the United States and wrote for journals in Argentina and elsewhere.\n\n[[File:Gabriela Mistral-01.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Chilean poet [[Gabriela Mistral]], first Latin American to win a [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], in 1945]]\n[[File:Gabogarciamarquez1.png|thumb|right|upright|[[Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] signing a copy of ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude]]'']]\n\nHowever, what really put Latin American literature on the global map was no doubt the literary [[Latin American Boom|boom]] of the 1960s and 1970s, distinguished by daring and experimental novels (such as [[Julio Cort\u00e1zar]]'s ''[[Hopscotch (Julio Cort\u00e1zar novel)|Rayuela]]'' (1963)) that were frequently published in Spain and quickly translated into English. The Boom's defining novel was [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]]'s ''[[One Hundred Years of Solitude|Cien a\u00f1os de soledad]]'' (1967), which led to the association of Latin American literature with [[magic realism]], though other important writers of the period such as the Peruvian [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] and [[Carlos Fuentes]] do not fit so easily within this framework. Arguably, the Boom's culmination was [[Augusto Roa Bastos]]'s monumental ''Yo, el supremo'' (1974). In the wake of the Boom, influential precursors such as [[Juan Rulfo]], [[Alejo Carpentier]], and above all [[Jorge Luis Borges]] were also rediscovered.\n\nContemporary literature in the region is vibrant and varied, ranging from the best-selling [[Paulo Coelho]] and [[Isabel Allende]] to the more avant-garde and critically acclaimed work of writers such as [[Diamela Eltit]], [[Giannina Braschi]], [[Ricardo Piglia]], or [[Roberto Bola\u00f1o]]. There has also been considerable attention paid to the genre of [[Testimony#Literature|testimonio]], texts produced in collaboration with [[Subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] subjects such as [[Rigoberta Mench\u00fa]]. Finally, a new breed of chroniclers is represented by the more journalistic [[Carlos Monsiv\u00e1is]] and Pedro Lemebel.\n\nThe region boasts six [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize winners]]: in addition to the two Chilean poets [[Gabriela Mistral]] (1945) and [[Pablo Neruda]] (1971), there is also the Guatemalan novelist [[Miguel Angel Asturias]] (1967), the Colombian writer [[Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez]] (1982),  the Mexican poet and essayist [[Octavio Paz]] (1990), and the Peruvian novelist [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] (2010).\n\n===Music and dance===\n{{See also|Music of Latin America|Latin pop|Latin dance}}\n[[File:Salsa en Cali.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] dancing in [[Cali]], [[Colombia]]]]\n\nLatin America has produced many successful worldwide artists in terms of recorded global music sales.

Unified in the early 1870s, the chancellor of this time period was [[Otto von Bismarck]]. Short-lived attempts of colonization by [[Kleinstaaterei|individual German states]] had occurred in preceding centuries, but crucial colonial efforts only began in 1884 with the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Claiming much of the left-over uncolonized areas in the [[Scramble for Africa]], Germany managed to build the third-largest [[colonial empire]] at the time, after the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Second French colonial empire|French]].<ref>[https://www.welt.de/kultur/article168705897/Diese-deutschen-Woerter-kennt-man-noch-in-der-Suedsee.html Diese deutschen W\u00f6rter kennt man noch in der S\u00fcdsee, von Matthias Heine] \"Einst hatten die Deutschen das drittgr\u00f6\u00dfte Kolonialreich[...]\"</ref>\n\nGermany lost control of its colonial empire when the [[World War I|First World War]] began in 1914, in which many of its colonies were seized by [[Allies of World War I|the Allies]] during the first weeks of the war. However, a number of German colonial military units held out for a while longer: [[German South West Africa]] surrendered in 1915, [[Kamerun]] in 1916 and [[German East Africa]] in 1918. In the case of German East Africa, the defenders under the command of [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]], had engaged a guerrilla war against British colonial and Portuguese forces and did not surrender until after the end of the war.\n\nGermany's colonial empire was officially confiscated with the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after Germany's defeat in the war and each colony became a [[League of Nations]] mandate under the supervision (but not ownership) of one of the victorious powers. The German colonial empire ceased to exist in 1919.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Biskup |first1=Thomas |last2=Kohlrausch |first2=Martin |title=Germany 2: Colonial Empire |url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileyempire/germany_2_colonial_empire/0 |website=Credo Online |publisher=Credo Reference}}</ref> Plans to regain their lost colonial possessions persisted through the Second World War, with many at the time suspecting that this was a goal of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] all along.<ref>Townsend, Mary (Jun 1938). \"The German Colonies and the Third Reich\". Political Science Quarterly. 53 (2): 186-206.</ref>\n\n== Origins ==\n=== German unification ===\nUntil their [[unification of Germany|1871 unification]], the German states had not concentrated on the development of a navy, and this essentially had precluded German participation in earlier [[imperialism|imperialist]] scrambles for remote [[colony|colonial]] territory \u2013 the so-called [[Weltpolitik|\"place in the sun\"]]. Germany seemed destined to play catch-up. The German states prior to 1870 had retained separate political structures and goals, and German foreign policy up to and including the age of [[Otto von Bismarck]] concentrated on resolving the \"German question\" in Europe and securing German interests on the continent.<ref>(5)</ref> However, by 1891 they were mostly united under Prussian rule.<ref>Biskup, Thomas; Kohlrausch, Martin. \"Germany 2: Colonial Empire\". Credo Online. Credo Reference.</ref> They also sought a more clear cut \"German\" state, and saw colonies as a good way to achieve that.<ref>(3)</ref>\n\n=== Scramble for colonies ===\n[[File:Gro\u00dfFriedrichsburg.JPG|thumb|right|[[Brandenburger Gold Coast|Gro\u00df-Friedrichsburg]], a [[Brandenburg]] colony (1683\u20131717) in the territory of modern [[Ghana]]]]\n[[File:Kladderadatsch 1884 - Die S\u00fcdsee ist das Mittelmeer der Zukunft.png|thumb|''Kladderadatsch'' caricature, 1884. Bismarck is happy with other nations being busy \"down there\"]]\nMany Germans in the late 19th century viewed colonial acquisitions as a true indication of having achieved nationhood. Public opinion eventually arrived at an understanding that prestigious African and Pacific colonies went hand-in-hand with dreams of a [[High Seas Fleet]]. Both aspirations would become reality, nurtured by a press replete with ''Kolonialfreunde'' [supporters of colonial acquisitions] and by a myriad of geographical associations and colonial societies. Bismarck and many deputies in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|''Reichstag'']] had no interest in colonial conquests merely to acquire square miles of territory.<ref>''Reichstag'' deputy [[Friedrich Kapp]] stated in debate in 1878 that whenever there is talk of \"colonization,\" he would recommend to keep pocketbooks out of sight, \"even if the proposal is for the acquisition of paradise.\" [Washausen, p. 58]</ref>\n\nIn 1844 Rhenish Aristocrats attempted to set up a German colony in the independent state of Texas. about 7400 settlers were involved. Around half of them died, the venture was a complete failure. A constant lack of supplies and land didn't help, and the next year Texas joined the United States.<ref name=\"Germany: 2. Colonial empire\"/>\n\nIn essence, Bismarck's colonial motives were obscure as he had said repeatedly \"...&nbsp;I am no man for colonies\"<ref>Taylor, ''Bismarck. The Man and the Statesman'', p. 215</ref> and \"remained as contemptuous of all colonial dreams as ever.\"<ref>Crankshaw, ''Bismarck'', p. 395</ref> However, in 1884 he consented to the acquisition of colonies by the German Empire, in order to protect trade, safeguard raw materials and export markets and take advantage of opportunities for capital investment, among other reasons.<ref>Washausen, p. 115</ref> In the very next year Bismarck shed personal involvement when \"he abandoned his colonial drive as suddenly and casually as he had started it\" as if he had committed an error in judgment that could confuse the substance of his more significant policies.<ref name=\"Crankshaw, p. 397\">Crankshaw, p. 397.</ref> \"Indeed, in 1889, [Bismarck] tried to give [[German South-West Africa]] away to the British. It was, he said, a burden and an expense, and he would like to saddle someone else with it.\"<ref>Taylor, p. 221.</ref>\n\nBefore this, Germans had traditions of foreign sea-borne trade dating back to the [[Hanseatic League]]; a tradition of German emigration that existed (eastward in the direction of [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Russia]] and [[Transylvanian Saxons|Transylvania]] and westward to the [[Americas]]); and North German merchants and missionaries showed interest in overseas engagements. The Hanseatic republics of [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]] sent traders across the globe. These trading houses conducted themselves as successful ''Privatkolonisatoren'' [independent colonizers] and concluded treaties and land purchases in [[Africa]] and the [[Pacific]] with chiefs and or other tribal leaders. These early agreements with local entities later formed the basis for annexation treaties, diplomatic support and military protection by the [[German Empire|German government]].<ref>Washusen, p. 61</ref>\n\n== Acquisition of colonies ==\nThe German Colonial empire got its start around 1884, and in those years they acquired several territories: [[German East Africa]], [[German South-West Africa]], [[German Cameroon]], and [[Togoland]] in Africa. Germany was also active in the Pacific, annexing a series of islands that would be called [[German New Guinea]]. The northeastern region of New Guinea was called Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, the Bismarck Archipelago to the islands east, this also contained two larger islands named New Mecklenburg and New Pomerania, they also acquired the Northern Solomon Islands. These islands were given the status of protectorate.<ref>{Biskup, Thomas; Kohlrausch, Martin. \"Germany 2: Colonial Empire\". Credo Online. Credo Reference. }</ref>\n\n=== Company land acquisitions and stewardship ===\n[[File:Kongokonferenz.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Congo conference]] 1884/1885 in Berlin laid the basis for the [[Scramble for Africa]], the colonial division of the continent.]]\nThe rise of German [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] coincided with the latter stages of the \"[[Scramble for Africa]]\" during which enterprising German individuals, rather than government entities, competed with other already established colonies and colonialist entrepreneurs. With the Germans joining the race for the last uncharted territories in Africa and the Pacific that had not yet been carved up, competition for colonies thus involved major European nations and several lesser powers.\n\nThe German effort included the first commercial enterprises in the 1850s and 1860s in West Africa, [[East Africa]], the [[Samoan Islands]] and the unexplored north-east quarter of [[New Guinea]] with adjacent islands.<ref>later [[Kaiser-Wilhelmsland]] and the [[Bismarck Archipelago]]</ref> German traders and merchants began to establish themselves in the African Cameroon delta and the mainland coast across from Zanzibar.<ref>Washausen, p. 67-114; the West and East Africa firms</ref> At [[Apia, Samoa|Apia]] and the settlements [[Finschhafen]], [[Rabaul|Simpsonhafen]] and the islands [[New Britain|Neu-Pommern]] and [[New Ireland (island)|Neu-Mecklenburg]], trading companies newly fortified with credit began expansion into coastal landholding.<ref>Haupt, p. 106</ref>\nLarge African inland acquisitions followed \u2014 mostly to the detriment of native inhabitants. In eastern Africa the imperialist and \"man-of-action\" [[Karl Peters]] accumulated vast tracts of land for his [[Society for German Colonization|colonization group]], \"emerging from the bush with X-marks [affixed by unlettered tribal chiefs] on documents ... for some 60 thousand square miles of the Zanzibar Sultanate\u2019s mainland property.\"<ref>Miller, ''Battle for the Bundu'', p. 6</ref>  Such exploratory missions required security measures that could be solved with small private, armed contingents recruited mainly in the Sudan and usually led by adventurous former military personnel of lower rank. Brutality, hanging and flogging prevailed during these land-grab expeditions under Peters\u2019 control as well as others as no-one \"held a monopoly in the mistreatment of Africans.\"<ref>Miller, p. 10</ref>\n\nAs [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] was converted to the colonial idea by 1884, he favored \"chartered company\" land management rather than establishment of colonial government due to financial considerations.<ref>Washausen, p. 116</ref> Although temperate zone cultivation flourished, the demise and often failure of tropical low-land enterprises contributed to changing Bismarck's view. He reluctantly acquiesced to pleas for help to deal with revolts and armed hostilities by often powerful [[Sultan of Zanzibar|rulers]] whose lucrative slaving activities seemed at risk. German native military forces initially engaged in dozens of punitive expeditions to apprehend and punish freedom fighters, at times with British assistance.<ref>Miller, p. 9</ref> The author Charles Miller offers the theory that the Germans had the handicap of trying to colonize African areas inhabited by aggressive tribes,<ref>once the military command was able to harness this aggressiveness through training, the German Askari forces of the [[Schutztruppe]] demonstrated that fierce spirit in their \u00e9lan and war time performance [Miller, p. 28]</ref> whereas their colonial neighbours had more docile peoples to contend with. At that time, the German penchant for giving muscle priority over patience contributed to continued unrest. Several of the African colonies remained powder kegs throughout this phase (and beyond). The transition to official acceptance of colonialism and to colonial government thus occurred during the last quarter of Bismarck's tenure of office.<ref>Miller, p. 7</ref>\n\n=== Growth ===\n[[File:Bahnhof L\u00fcderitz.jpg|thumb|Railway station in [[L\u00fcderitz]], Namibia, 2006]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2007-0013, Reise Bernhard Dernburgs duch Deutsch-Ostafrika.jpg|thumb|left|German Colonial Secretary Bernhard Dernburg (2nd from right) on an inspection tour in East Africa, with British officials at [[Nairobi]] in 1907]]\n[[File:Postcard from New Guinea.jpg|thumb|Postcards depicted romanticized images of natives and exotic locales, such as this early 20th-century card of the German colonial territory in [[New Guinea]].]]\n\nIn the first years of the 20th-century shipping lines had established scheduled services with refrigerated holds and agricultural products from the colonies, exotic fruits and spices, were sold to the public in Germany. The colonies were romanticized. Geologists and cartographers explored what were the unmarked regions on European maps, identifying mountains and rivers, and demarcating boundaries.  [[Hermann Detzner]] and one Captain Nugent, R.A., had charge of a joint project to demarcate the British and German frontiers of [[Cameroon]], which was published in 1913.<ref>Detzner, Hermann, (Oberleut.) ''Kamerun Boundary: Die nigerische Grenze von Kamerun zwischen Yola und dem Cross-fluss.'' '''M. Teuts. Schutzgeb.''' 26 (13): 317\u2013338.</ref> Travelers and newspaper reporters brought back stories of black and brown natives serving German managers and settlers. There were also suspicions and reports of colonial malfeasance, corruption and brutality in some protectorates, and [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] missionaries dispatched disturbing reports to their mission headquarters in Germany.<ref>Louis (1963), p. 178</ref>\n\nGerman colonial diplomatic efforts remained commercially inspired, \"the colonial economy was thriving ... and roads, railways, shipping and telegraph communications were up to the minute.\"<ref name=\"Garfield, p. 83\"/> Overhaul of the colonial administrative apparatus thus set the stage for the final and most promising period of German colonialism.<ref name=\"Miller, p. 19\"/> Bernhard Dernburg's declaration that the indigenous population in the protectorates \"was the most important factor in our colonies\" was affirmed by new laws. The use of forced, unpaid labor went on the books as a criminal offense.<ref name=\"Miller, p. 20\"/> Governor [[Wilhelm Solf]] of [[German Samoa|Samoa]] would call the islanders ''\"unsere braunen Sch\u00fctzlinge\"'' [our brown charges], who could be guided but not forced.<ref>Churchill, Llewella P. ''Samoa 'uma''. New York: F&S Publishing Co., 1932, p. 231</ref> [[Heinrich Schnee]] in East Africa proclaimed that \"the dominant feature of my administration [will be] ... the welfare of the natives entrusted into my care.\"<ref name=\"Miller, p. 21\">Miller, p. 21</ref> Idealists often volunteered for selection and appointment to government posts, while others with an entrepreneurial bent labored to swell the dividends at home for the Hanseatic trading houses and shipping lines. Subsequent historians would commend German colonialism in those years as \"an engine of modernization with far-reaching effects for the future.\"<ref>Gann, L.H. & Duignan, Peter. ''The Rulers of German East Africa, 1884\u20131914''. Palo Alto, California: Stanford University Press. 1977, p. 271</ref>\nThe native population was forced into unequal treaties by the German colonial governments. This led to the local tribes and natives losing their influence and power and eventually forced some of them to become [[Slavery|slave]] laborers. Although slavery was partially outlawed in 1905 by Germany, this caused a great deal of resentment and led eventually to revolts by the native population{{explain|date=December 2016}}. The result was several military and genocidal campaigns by the Germans against the natives.<ref>[[Hull, Isabel V.]], ''Absolute destruction: military culture and the practices of war in Imperial Germany'', pp 3ff.</ref> Political and economic subjugation of [[Herero people|Herero]] and [[Nama people|Nama]] was envisioned. Both the colonial authorities and settlers were of the opinion that native Africans were to be a lower class, their land seized and handed over to settlers and companies, while the remaining population was to be put in reservations; the Germans planned to make a colony inhabited predominately by whites: a \"new African Germany\".<ref>A. Dirk Moses, ''Empire, Colony, Genocide: Conquest, Occupation and Subaltern Resistance in World History'', p. 301</ref>\n\nThe established merchants and plantation operators in the African colonies frequently managed to sway government policies.

Foreign Secretary Sir [[Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon|Edward Grey]], considered still a moderate in 1911, was willing to \"study the map of Africa in a pro-German spirit\".<ref>Louis (1967), p. 30.</ref> Britain further recognized that Germany really had little of value to offer in territorial transactions; however, advice to Grey and Prime Minister [[H. H. Asquith]] hardened by early 1914 \"to stop the trend of what the advisers considered Germany\u2019s taking and Britain\u2019s giving.\"<ref>Louis (1967), p. 31.</ref>\n\nOnce war was declared in late July 1914 Britain and its allies promptly moved against the colonies. The public was informed that German colonies were a threat because \"Every German colony has a powerful wireless station \u2014 they will talk to one another across the seas, and at every opportunity they [German ships] will dash from cover to harry and destroy our commerce, and maybe, to raid our coasts.\"<ref>Louis (1967), p. 37.</ref>  The British position that Germany was a uniquely brutal and cruel colonial power originated during the war; it had not been said during peacetime.<ref>Louis (1967), pp. 16, 36</ref>\n\nIn the Pacific, Britain's [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|ally Japan]] [[Japan during World War I|declared war]] on Germany in 1914 and quickly seized several of Germany's island colonies, the [[Mariana Islands|Mariana]], [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] and [[Marshall Islands]], with virtually no resistance.\n\nBy 1916 only in remote jungle regions in East Africa did the German forces hold out.  South Africa's [[Jan Smuts|J.C. Smuts]], now in Britain's small War Cabinet, spoke of German schemes for world power, militarisation and exploitation of resources, indicating Germany threatened western civilisation itself.

With the concluding [[Treaty of Versailles]], Article 22, German colonies were transformed into [[League of Nations mandates]] and divided between Belgium, the United Kingdom, and certain British Dominions, France and Japan with the determination not to see any of them returned to Germany \u2014 a guarantee secured by Article 119.<ref>Louis (1967), p. 9</ref>\n\nIn Africa, the United Kingdom and France divided [[German Kamerun]] (Cameroons) and [[Togoland]]. Belgium gained [[Ruanda-Urundi]] in northwestern [[German East Africa]], the United Kingdom obtained by far the greater landmass of this colony, thus gaining the \"missing link\" in the chain of British possessions stretching from South Africa to Egypt ([[Cape to Cairo Red Line|Cape to Cairo]]), and Portugal received the [[Kionga Triangle]], a sliver of German East Africa. German South-West Africa was taken under mandate by the Union of South Africa.<ref>German South-West Africa was the only African colony designated as a Class C mandate, meaning that the indigenous population was judged incapable of even limited self-government and the colony to be administered under the laws of the mandatory as an integral portion of its territory, however, South Africa never annexed the country outright although Smuts did toy with the idea.</ref> In terms of the population of 12.5 million people in 1914,  42 percent were transferred to mandates of Britain and its dominions. 33 percent to France, and 25 percent to Belgium.<ref>J.

Settlement in Africa was not popular and was not a focus for [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Established in 1936, the [[Reichskolonialbund]] under [[Franz Ritter von Epp]] absorbed all colonial organizations and was meant to raise pro-colonial sentiments, public interest in former German colonies, and take part in political agitation. However, with the onset of [[World War II]] the organization entered a decline, before being disbanded by decree in 1943 for \"activity irrelevant to the war\".\n\nThere are hardly any special ties between modern Germany and its former colonies; for example, there is no postcolonial league comparable to the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] or French [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]]. In stark contrast with French and English, both of which are widely spoken across the continent by those of both African and European ancestry, the German language is not a significant language in Africa even within former colonies\u2014although it is spoken by a significant minority of the population of [[Namibia]]. Germany cooperates economically and culturally with many countries in Africa and Asia, independent of colonial history.\n\n== Administration and colonial policies ==\n=== Colonial governments ===\n[[File:German Empire and colonies.svg|thumb|left|Political diagramme of the German Empire and its colonies]]\n[[File:Lom\u00e9 Togo Weg nach dem Gouverneurspalast 1904.png|thumb|The way to the governor's palace in Togo, 1904]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2006-0137, Deutsch-S\u00fcdwestafrika, Witbooi bei dt.

Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] understood and lamented his nation's position as colonial followers rather than leaders. In an interview with [[Cecil Rhodes]] in March 1899 he stated the alleged dilemma clearly: \"...&nbsp;Germany has begun her colonial enterprise very late, and was, therefore, at the disadvantage of finding all the desirable places already occupied.\"<ref>Louis (1963), ''Ruanda-Urundi'', p. 163</ref>\n\nThe German colonists included people like [[Carl Peters]] who brutalized the local population.<ref>German Colonialism: A Short History, Sebastian Conrad, page 146, Cambridge University Press, 2012</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Germany did assemble an overseas empire in [[Africa]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] (see [[List of former German colonies]]) in the last two decades of the 19th century; \"the creation of Germany's colonial empire proceeded with the minimum of friction.\"<ref name=\"Crankshaw, p. 397\"/> The acquisition and the expansion of colonies were accomplished in a variety of ways, but principally through mercantile domination and pretexts that were always economic. Agreements and treaties with other colonial powers or interests followed, and [[fee simple]] purchases of land or island groups.<ref>As an example, in February 1899 a [[German-Spanish Treaty (1899)|treaty]] was signed by which Spain sold the Caroline and Mariana Islands and Palau for 17 million [[German gold mark|gold mark]] to Germany</ref> Only [[Togoland]] and [[German Samoa]] became profitable and self-sufficient; the balance sheet for the colonies as a whole revealed a fiscal net loss for the empire.<ref>Haupt, ''Deutschlands Schutzgebiete'', p. 85</ref> Despite this, the leadership in [[Berlin]] committed the nation to the financial support, maintenance, development and defence of these possessions.\n\n=== German colonial population ===\nThe [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] who emigrated to America in the 17th and 18th centuries were religious refugees from the [[Thirty Years War]] which devastated the German states 1616-1648 rather than colonial settlers. [[Germantown, Philadelphia|Germantown, Pennsylvania]], was founded in 1684 and 65,000 Germans landed in Philadelphia alone between 1727 and 1775, and more at other American ports.  More than 950,000 Germans immigrated to the US in the 1850s and 1,453,000 in the 1880s, but these were personal migrants, unrelated to the German Empire (created 1871) and later colonial plans.

Some historians argue that Germany's role in southwestern Africa gave rise to an emphasis on racial superiority at home, which in turn was used by the Nazis. They argue that the limited successes of German colonialism overseas led to a decision to shift the main focus of German expansionism into [[Central and Eastern Europe]], with the [[Mitteleuropa#Mitteleuropa Plan|Mitteleuropa plan]]. German colonialism, therefore, turned to the European continent.<ref>''Germany subsequently tried to turn Europe into its colonial possession by practicing a migrations form of colonialism that was reworked into the ideology of [[Lebensraum]](...)Aime Cesaire pointed out that [[fascism]] was a form of colonialism brought home to Europe'' Postcolonialism: An Historical Introduction Robert Young Published 2001\nBlackwell Publishing page 2</ref>\n\nWhile a minority view during the ''Kaiserzeit'', the idea developed in full swing under [[Erich Ludendorff]] and his political activity in the [[Baltic states]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Poland]]. Subsequently, after the defeat of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] during World War I, Germany acquired vast territories with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] and created several administrative regions like [[Ober Ost]]. Here also the German settlement would be implemented, and the whole governmental organization was developed to serve German needs while controlling the local ethnically diverse population. While the African colonies were too isolated and not suitable for mass settlement of Germans, areas in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] offered better potential for German settlement.<ref>Helmut Bley,'' Continuities and German Colonialism: Colonial Experience and Metropolitan Developments'' Historisches Seminar, Universit\u00e4t Hannover 2004</ref> Other scholars, are skeptical and challenge the continuity thesis.<ref>Volker Langbehn and Mohammad SalamaRace, eds.

Unified in the early 1870s, the chancellor of this time period was [[Otto von Bismarck]]. Short-lived attempts of colonization by [[Kleinstaaterei|individual German states]] had occurred in preceding centuries, but crucial colonial efforts only began in 1884 with the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Claiming much of the left-over uncolonized areas in the [[Scramble for Africa]], Germany managed to build the third-largest [[colonial empire]] at the time, after the [[British Empire|British]] and [[Second French colonial empire|French]].<ref>[https://www.welt.de/kultur/article168705897/Diese-deutschen-Woerter-kennt-man-noch-in-der-Suedsee.html Diese deutschen W\u00f6rter kennt man noch in der S\u00fcdsee, von Matthias Heine] \"Einst hatten die Deutschen das drittgr\u00f6\u00dfte Kolonialreich[...]\"</ref>\n\nGermany lost control of its colonial empire when the [[World War I|First World War]] began in 1914, in which many of its colonies were seized by [[Allies of World War I|the Allies]] during the first weeks of the war. However, a number of German colonial military units held out for a while longer: [[German South West Africa]] surrendered in 1915, [[Kamerun]] in 1916 and [[German East Africa]] in 1918. In the case of German East Africa, the defenders under the command of [[Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck]], had engaged a guerrilla war against British colonial and Portuguese forces and did not surrender until after the end of the war.\n\nGermany's colonial empire was officially confiscated with the [[Treaty of Versailles]] after Germany's defeat in the war and each colony became a [[League of Nations]] mandate under the supervision (but not ownership) of one of the victorious powers. The German colonial empire ceased to exist in 1919.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Biskup |first1=Thomas |last2=Kohlrausch |first2=Martin |title=Germany 2: Colonial Empire |url=https://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/wileyempire/germany_2_colonial_empire/0 |website=Credo Online |publisher=Credo Reference}}</ref> Plans to regain their lost colonial possessions persisted through the Second World War, with many at the time suspecting that this was a goal of the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] all along.<ref>Townsend, Mary (Jun 1938). \"The German Colonies and the Third Reich\".

Germany seemed destined to play catch-up.

Bismarck is happy with other nations being busy \"down there\"]]\nMany Germans in the late 19th century viewed colonial acquisitions as a true indication of having achieved nationhood. Public opinion eventually arrived at an understanding that prestigious African and Pacific colonies went hand-in-hand with dreams of a [[High Seas Fleet]]. Both aspirations would become reality, nurtured by a press replete with ''Kolonialfreunde'' [supporters of colonial acquisitions] and by a myriad of geographical associations and colonial societies. Bismarck and many deputies in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|''Reichstag'']] had no interest in colonial conquests merely to acquire square miles of territory.<ref>''Reichstag'' deputy [[Friedrich Kapp]] stated in debate in 1878 that whenever there is talk of \"colonization,\" he would recommend to keep pocketbooks out of sight, \"even if the proposal is for the acquisition of paradise.\" [Washausen, p. 58]</ref>\n\nIn 1844 Rhenish Aristocrats attempted to set up a German colony in the independent state of Texas. about 7400 settlers were involved.

The Man and the Statesman'', p. 215</ref> and \"remained as contemptuous of all colonial dreams as ever.\"<ref>Crankshaw, ''Bismarck'', p. 395</ref> However, in 1884 he consented to the acquisition of colonies by the German Empire, in order to protect trade, safeguard raw materials and export markets and take advantage of opportunities for capital investment, among other reasons.<ref>Washausen, p. 115</ref> In the very next year Bismarck shed personal involvement when \"he abandoned his colonial drive as suddenly and casually as he had started it\" as if he had committed an error in judgment that could confuse the substance of his more significant policies.<ref name=\"Crankshaw, p. 397\">Crankshaw, p. 397.</ref> \"Indeed, in 1889, [Bismarck] tried to give [[German South-West Africa]] away to the British.

The Hanseatic republics of [[Hamburg]] and [[Bremen]] sent traders across the globe. These trading houses conducted themselves as successful ''Privatkolonisatoren'' [independent colonizers] and concluded treaties and land purchases in [[Africa]] and the [[Pacific]] with chiefs and or other tribal leaders. These early agreements with local entities later formed the basis for annexation treaties, diplomatic support and military protection by the [[German Empire|German government]].<ref>Washusen, p. 61</ref>\n\n== Acquisition of colonies ==\nThe German Colonial empire got its start around 1884, and in those years they acquired several territories: [[German East Africa]], [[German South-West Africa]], [[German Cameroon]], and [[Togoland]] in Africa. Germany was also active in the Pacific, annexing a series of islands that would be called [[German New Guinea]]. The northeastern region of New Guinea was called Kaiser-Wilhelmsland, the Bismarck Archipelago to the islands east, this also contained two larger islands named New Mecklenburg and New Pomerania, they also acquired the Northern Solomon Islands. These islands were given the status of protectorate.<ref>{Biskup, Thomas; Kohlrausch, Martin. \"Germany 2: Colonial Empire\". Credo Online.

With the Germans joining the race for the last uncharted territories in Africa and the Pacific that had not yet been carved up, competition for colonies thus involved major European nations and several lesser powers.\n\nThe German effort included the first commercial enterprises in the 1850s and 1860s in West Africa, [[East Africa]], the [[Samoan Islands]] and the unexplored north-east quarter of [[New Guinea]] with adjacent islands.<ref>later [[Kaiser-Wilhelmsland]] and the [[Bismarck Archipelago]]</ref> German traders and merchants began to establish themselves in the African Cameroon delta and the mainland coast across from Zanzibar.<ref>Washausen, p. 67-114; the West and East Africa firms</ref> At [[Apia, Samoa|Apia]] and the settlements [[Finschhafen]], [[Rabaul|Simpsonhafen]] and the islands [[New Britain|Neu-Pommern]] and [[New Ireland (island)|Neu-Mecklenburg]], trading companies newly fortified with credit began expansion into coastal landholding.<ref>Haupt, p. 106</ref>\nLarge African inland acquisitions followed \u2014 mostly to the detriment of native inhabitants. In eastern Africa the imperialist and \"man-of-action\" [[Karl Peters]] accumulated vast tracts of land for his [[Society for German Colonization|colonization group]], \"emerging from the bush with X-marks [affixed by unlettered tribal chiefs] on documents ... for some 60 thousand square miles of the Zanzibar Sultanate\u2019s mainland property.\"<ref>Miller, ''Battle for the Bundu'', p. 6</ref>  Such exploratory missions required security measures that could be solved with small private, armed contingents recruited mainly in the Sudan and usually led by adventurous former military personnel of lower rank. Brutality, hanging and flogging prevailed during these land-grab expeditions under Peters\u2019 control as well as others as no-one \"held a monopoly in the mistreatment of Africans.\"<ref>Miller, p. 10</ref>\n\nAs [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] was converted to the colonial idea by 1884, he favored \"chartered company\" land management rather than establishment of colonial government due to financial considerations.<ref>Washausen, p. 116</ref> Although temperate zone cultivation flourished, the demise and often failure of tropical low-land enterprises contributed to changing Bismarck's view. He reluctantly acquiesced to pleas for help to deal with revolts and armed hostilities by often powerful [[Sultan of Zanzibar|rulers]] whose lucrative slaving activities seemed at risk. German native military forces initially engaged in dozens of punitive expeditions to apprehend and punish freedom fighters, at times with British assistance.<ref>Miller, p. 9</ref> The author Charles Miller offers the theory that the Germans had the handicap of trying to colonize African areas inhabited by aggressive tribes,<ref>once the military command was able to harness this aggressiveness through training, the German Askari forces of the [[Schutztruppe]] demonstrated that fierce spirit in their \u00e9lan and war time performance [Miller, p. 28]</ref> whereas their colonial neighbours had more docile peoples to contend with. At that time, the German penchant for giving muscle priority over patience contributed to continued unrest. Several of the African colonies remained powder kegs throughout this phase (and beyond). The transition to official acceptance of colonialism and to colonial government thus occurred during the last quarter of Bismarck's tenure of office.<ref>Miller, p. 7</ref>\n\n=== Growth ===\n[[File:Bahnhof L\u00fcderitz.jpg|thumb|Railway station in [[L\u00fcderitz]], Namibia, 2006]]\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2007-0013, Reise Bernhard Dernburgs duch Deutsch-Ostafrika.jpg|thumb|left|German Colonial Secretary Bernhard Dernburg (2nd from right) on an inspection tour in East Africa, with British officials at [[Nairobi]] in 1907]]\n[[File:Postcard from New Guinea.jpg|thumb|Postcards depicted romanticized images of natives and exotic locales, such as this early 20th-century card of the German colonial territory in [[New Guinea]].]]\n\nIn the first years of the 20th-century shipping lines had established scheduled services with refrigerated holds and agricultural products from the colonies, exotic fruits and spices, were sold to the public in Germany.

The public was informed that German colonies were a threat because \"Every German colony has a powerful wireless station \u2014 they will talk to one another across the seas, and at every opportunity they [German ships] will dash from cover to harry and destroy our commerce, and maybe, to raid our coasts.\"<ref>Louis (1967), p. 37.</ref>  The British position that Germany was a uniquely brutal and cruel colonial power originated during the war; it had not been said during peacetime.<ref>Louis (1967), pp. 16, 36</ref>\n\nIn the Pacific, Britain's [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|ally Japan]] [[Japan during World War I|declared war]] on Germany in 1914 and quickly seized several of Germany's island colonies, the [[Mariana Islands|Mariana]], [[Caroline Islands|Caroline]] and [[Marshall Islands]], with virtually no resistance.\n\nBy 1916 only in remote jungle regions in East Africa did the German forces hold out.

German South-West Africa was taken under mandate by the Union of South Africa.<ref>German South-West Africa was the only African colony designated as a Class C mandate, meaning that the indigenous population was judged incapable of even limited self-government and the colony to be administered under the laws of the mandatory as an integral portion of its territory, however, South Africa never annexed the country outright although Smuts did toy with the idea.</ref> In terms of the population of 12.5 million people in 1914,  42 percent were transferred to mandates of Britain and its dominions. 33 percent to France, and 25 percent to Belgium.<ref>J.

Settlement in Africa was not popular and was not a focus for [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]]. Established in 1936, the [[Reichskolonialbund]] under [[Franz Ritter von Epp]] absorbed all colonial organizations and was meant to raise pro-colonial sentiments, public interest in former German colonies, and take part in political agitation. However, with the onset of [[World War II]] the organization entered a decline, before being disbanded by decree in 1943 for \"activity irrelevant to the war\".\n\nThere are hardly any special ties between modern Germany and its former colonies; for example, there is no postcolonial league comparable to the British [[Commonwealth of Nations]] or French [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]]. In stark contrast with French and English, both of which are widely spoken across the continent by those of both African and European ancestry, the German language is not a significant language in Africa even within former colonies\u2014although it is spoken by a significant minority of the population of [[Namibia]].

Kaiser [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]] understood and lamented his nation's position as colonial followers rather than leaders. In an interview with [[Cecil Rhodes]] in March 1899 he stated the alleged dilemma clearly: \"...&nbsp;Germany has begun her colonial enterprise very late, and was, therefore, at the disadvantage of finding all the desirable places already occupied.\"<ref>Louis (1963), ''Ruanda-Urundi'', p. 163</ref>\n\nThe German colonists included people like [[Carl Peters]] who brutalized the local population.<ref>German Colonialism: A Short History, Sebastian Conrad, page 146, Cambridge University Press, 2012</ref>\n\nNonetheless, Germany did assemble an overseas empire in [[Africa]] and the [[Pacific Ocean]] (see [[List of former German colonies]]) in the last two decades of the 19th century; \"the creation of Germany's colonial empire proceeded with the minimum of friction.\"<ref name=\"Crankshaw, p. 397\"/> The acquisition and the expansion of colonies were accomplished in a variety of ways, but principally through mercantile domination and pretexts that were always economic.

German colonial rule in Africa 1884-1914 was an expression of nationalism and moral superiority that was justified by constructing an image of the natives as \"Other\". German colonization was characterized by the use of repressive violence in the name of \u2018culture\u2019 and \u2018civilization\u2019. Germany's cultural-missionary project boasted that its colonial programs were humanitarian and educational endeavors.  Furthermore, the wide acceptance among intellectuals of [[social Darwinism]] justified Germany's right to acquire colonial territories as a matter of the \u2018survival of the fittest\u2019, according to historian Michael Schubert.<ref>Michael Schubert, \"The \u2018German nation\u2019 and the \u2018black Other\u2019: social Darwinism and the cultural mission in German colonial discourse,\" ''Patterns of Prejudice'' (2011) 45#5 pp 399-416.</ref><ref>Felicity Rash, ''The Discourse Strategies of Imperialist Writing: The German Colonial Idea and Africa, 1848-1945'' (Routledge, 2016).</ref>\n\nColonial German physicians and administrators tried to make a case for increasing the native population, in order to also increase their numbers of laborers.

Some historians argue that Germany's role in southwestern Africa gave rise to an emphasis on racial superiority at home, which in turn was used by the Nazis. They argue that the limited successes of German colonialism overseas led to a decision to shift the main focus of German expansionism into [[Central and Eastern Europe]], with the [[Mitteleuropa#Mitteleuropa Plan|Mitteleuropa plan]]. German colonialism, therefore, turned to the European continent.<ref>''Germany subsequently tried to turn Europe into its colonial possession by practicing a migrations form of colonialism that was reworked into the ideology of [[Lebensraum]](...)Aime Cesaire pointed out that [[fascism]] was a form of colonialism brought home to Europe'' Postcolonialism: An Historical Introduction Robert Young Published 2001\nBlackwell Publishing page 2</ref>\n\nWhile a minority view during the ''Kaiserzeit'', the idea developed in full swing under [[Erich Ludendorff]] and his political activity in the [[Baltic states]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Poland]]. Subsequently, after the defeat of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] during World War I, Germany acquired vast territories with the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] and created several administrative regions like [[Ober Ost]]. Here also the German settlement would be implemented, and the whole governmental organization was developed to serve German needs while controlling the local ethnically diverse population. While the African colonies were too isolated and not suitable for mass settlement of Germans, areas in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] offered better potential for German settlement.<ref>Helmut Bley,'' Continuities and German Colonialism: Colonial Experience and Metropolitan Developments'' Historisches Seminar, Universit\u00e4t Hannover 2004</ref> Other scholars, are skeptical and challenge the continuity thesis.<ref>Volker Langbehn and Mohammad SalamaRace, eds.
