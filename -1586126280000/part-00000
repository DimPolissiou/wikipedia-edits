Ordinances are a vital part of the theology of the church, which teaches that they were practiced by the Lord's covenant people in all [[Dispensationalist theology|dispensations]]. Additionally, members consider the temple a place to [[direct revelation|commune with God]], seek His aid, understand His will, and receive [[Revelation#Latter Day Saint concept of revelation|personal revelation]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mesa-thumb-lg-3.jpg|thumb|The [[Mesa Arizona Temple]], one of three patterned after the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple of Solomon]]]]\nIn 1832, shortly after the formation of the church, [[Joseph Smith]] said that the Lord desired the [[Latter-day Saints|saints]] build a temple;<ref>Recorded in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], Smith wrote that the Lord commanded the Saints to \"establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God;\" (see {{LDS|D&C|dc|88|119|120}})</ref> and they completed the [[Kirtland Temple]] in 1836. Initially, the church constructed temples in areas where there were large concentrations of members: [[Utah]], [[Idaho]], [[Arizona]], [[Hawaii]] (all in the USA), and [[Alberta]] ([[Canada]]). In the mid 20th century, because of the importance of temples in the theology, the church tried to balance density with the travel requirements attending the temple imposed upon members. Thus, temples were built in [[Europe]] (namely, [[Switzerland]] dedicated in 1955 and [[England]] dedicated in 1958); the [[Pacific Islands]] (namely, [[New Zealand]] dedicated in 1958); and [[Washington, D.C.]]&nbsp;(dedicated in 1974, the first American temple East of Utah since [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo]] in 1846). All were dedicated at a time when membership in the region alone might not have justified the effort.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Spencer W. Kimball]] directed the church to build smaller temples with similar designs<ref>Before this time, all but the [[Bern Switzerland Temple|Swiss Temple]] were at least {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}, and the average size of the first 20 temples was {{convert|103000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}. The new temples varied in size but were generally less than {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}. By comparison, the [[Nauvoo Temple]], built in the 1840s, was {{convert|54000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}. Some of these temples have been remodeled since the original construction to provide additional rooms,</ref> allowing temples to be built where there were fewer members. As a result, the first temples in [[South America]] ([[Brazil]] dedicated in 1978); [[Asia]] ([[Japan]] dedicated in 1980); and [[Mexico]] ([[Mexico City]] dedicated in 1983) were built and the number of temples doubled from 15 to 36.\n\n[[File:Columbus Ohio Temple 2005.jpg|thumb|The [[Columbus Ohio Temple]], an example of smaller temples built under [[Gordon B. Hinckley|Hinckley's]] direction]]\nChurch [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] (1910\u20132008) also accelerated the construction of temples through the use of an even smaller standardized base design.<ref>Hinckley announced the use of smaller standardized temples in 1997 ({{Cite web |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/general-conference/conferences?lang=eng |title=Some Thoughts on Temples, Retention of Converts, and Missionary Service |accessdate=October 30, 2006 |work=167th Semiannual General Conference, October 1997 |first=Gordon B. |last=Hinckley |authorlink=Gordon B. Hinckley}}). The base design is about {{convert|10700|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}, and temples built from the design are generally between {{convert|10000|and|18000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}. These temples generally do not include a large laundry facility, do not provide members with the ability to rent temple clothing, nor provide a cafeteria for members (Almanac, 2000).</ref>\nIn 1998, when there were 51 temples, Hinckley set a goal to have 100 temples in place before the end of 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1998/04/new-temples-to-provide-crowning-blessings-of-the-gospel?lang=eng |title=New Temples to Provide 'Crowning Blessings' of the Gospel |accessdate=October 30, 2006 |work=168th Annual General Conference, April 1998 |first=Gordon B. |last=Hinckley}}</ref> Between the brief building period from 1998 to 2001, 38 of these standardized temples were constructed and dedicated, meeting Hinckley's goal by having 102 dedicated temples before 2000 closed. During Hinckley's service as president, the number of temples more than doubled from 47 to 124.<ref>Because the two [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church presidents]] before Hinckley (Kimball and [[Ezra Taft Benson]]) had incapacitating illnesses during the latter part of their administration, Hinckley dedicated a total of 84 temples, even though, during his presidency, 14 temples were dedicated by others: [[James E.

Ordinances are a vital part of the theology of the church, which teaches that they were practiced by the Lord's covenant people in all [[Dispensationalist theology|dispensations]]. Additionally, members consider the temple a place to [[direct revelation|commune with God]], seek His aid, understand His will, and receive [[Revelation#Latter Day Saint concept of revelation|personal revelation]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:Mesa-thumb-lg-3.jpg|thumb|The [[Mesa Arizona Temple]], one of three patterned after the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Temple of Solomon]]]]\nIn 1832, shortly after the formation of the church, [[Joseph Smith]] said that the Lord desired the [[Latter-day Saints|saints]] build a temple;<ref>Recorded in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], Smith wrote that the Lord commanded the Saints to \"establish a house, even a house of prayer, a house of fasting, a house of faith, a house of learning, a house of glory, a house of order, a house of God;\" (see {{LDS|D&C|dc|88|119|120}})</ref> and they completed the [[Kirtland Temple]] in 1836. Initially, the church constructed temples in areas where there were large concentrations of members: [[Utah]], [[Idaho]], [[Arizona]], [[Hawaii]] (all in the USA), and [[Alberta]] ([[Canada]]). In the mid 20th century, because of the importance of temples in the theology, the church tried to balance density with the travel requirements attending the temple imposed upon members. Thus, temples were built in [[Europe]] (namely, [[Switzerland]] dedicated in 1955 and [[England]] dedicated in 1958); the [[Pacific Islands]] (namely, [[New Zealand]] dedicated in 1958); and [[Washington, D.C.]]&nbsp;(dedicated in 1974, the first American temple East of Utah since [[Nauvoo Temple|Nauvoo]] in 1846). All were dedicated at a time when membership in the region alone might not have justified the effort.\n\nIn the 1980s, [[Spencer W. Kimball]] directed the church to build smaller temples with similar designs<ref>Before this time, all but the [[Bern Switzerland Temple|Swiss Temple]] were at least {{convert|45000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}, and the average size of the first 20 temples was {{convert|103000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}. The new temples varied in size but were generally less than {{convert|25000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}. By comparison, the [[Nauvoo Temple]], built in the 1840s, was {{convert|54000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}. Some of these temples have been remodeled since the original construction to provide additional rooms,</ref> allowing temples to be built where there were fewer members. As a result, the first temples in [[South America]] ([[Brazil]] dedicated in 1978); [[Asia]] ([[Japan]] dedicated in 1980); and [[Mexico]] ([[Mexico City]] dedicated in 1983) were built and the number of temples doubled from 15 to 36.\n\n[[File:Columbus Ohio Temple 2005.jpg|thumb|The [[Columbus Ohio Temple]], an example of smaller temples built under [[Gordon B. Hinckley|Hinckley's]] direction]]\nChurch [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]] [[Gordon B. Hinckley]] (1910\u20132008) also accelerated the construction of temples through the use of an even smaller standardized base design.<ref>Hinckley announced the use of smaller standardized temples in 1997 ({{Cite web |url= https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/general-conference/conferences?lang=eng |title=Some Thoughts on Temples, Retention of Converts, and Missionary Service |accessdate=October 30, 2006 |work=167th Semiannual General Conference, October 1997 |first=Gordon B. |last=Hinckley |authorlink=Gordon B. Hinckley}}). The base design is about {{convert|10700|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}, and temples built from the design are generally between {{convert|10000|and|18000|sqft|m2|sigfig=2}}. These temples generally do not include a large laundry facility, do not provide members with the ability to rent temple clothing, nor provide a cafeteria for members (Almanac, 2000).</ref>\nIn 1998, when there were 51 temples, Hinckley set a goal to have 100 temples in place before the end of 2000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.churchofjesuschrist.org/study/general-conference/1998/04/new-temples-to-provide-crowning-blessings-of-the-gospel?lang=eng |title=New Temples to Provide 'Crowning Blessings' of the Gospel |accessdate=October 30, 2006 |work=168th Annual General Conference, April 1998 |first=Gordon B. |last=Hinckley}}</ref> Between the brief building period from 1998 to 2001, 38 of these standardized temples were constructed and dedicated, meeting Hinckley's goal by having 102 dedicated temples before 2000 closed. During Hinckley's service as president, the number of temples more than doubled from 47 to 124.<ref>Because the two [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|church presidents]] before Hinckley (Kimball and [[Ezra Taft Benson]]) had incapacitating illnesses during the latter part of their administration, Hinckley dedicated a total of 84 temples, even though, during his presidency, 14 temples were dedicated by others: [[James E.

Those 'tolerated' could still be barred from civil offices, military positions, and university posts.\"<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\"/> In short, religious toleration is only the absence of [[religious persecution]], and does not necessarily preclude [[religious discrimination]]. However, in the following decades something extraordinary happened in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], at least if one views the events from \"a late eighteenth-century perspective\".<ref name=\"Beneke06-5\">Beneke 2006: 5.</ref> Gradually the colonial governments expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and the 1780s, they replaced it with \"something that is usually called [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]]\".<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\"/> Mark Silka, in \"Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis\", states that Religious pluralism \"enables a country made up of people of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it is a [[cultural construct]] that embodies some shared conception of how a country's various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation whole.\"<ref name=\"Silk 64\u201381\"/>\n\nReligious pluralism can be defined as \"respecting the otherness of others\". Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a particular region. [[Exclusivist]] religions teach that theirs is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other religions. Some [[Protestant]] [[sect]]s argue fiercely against [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] of all kinds teach that religious practices like those of [[Paganism]] and [[witchcraft]] are pernicious. This was a common historical attitude prior to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and has appeared as governmental policy into the present day under systems like [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Taliban]] regime, which destroyed the ancient [[Buddhas of Bamyan]].\n\nGiving one religion or denomination special rights that are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation was observed in Europe through the [[Lateran Treaty]] and [[Church of England]]. In modern era, many Islamic countries have laws that criminalize the act of leaving Islam to someone born in Muslim family, forbid entry to non-Muslims into Mosques, and forbid construction of Church, Synagogue or Temples inside their countries.<ref name=meister>Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp 32-57</ref>\n\n[[Relativism]], the belief that all religions are equal in their value and that none of the religions give access to absolute truth, is an extreme form of [[inclusivism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carm.org/what-relativism|title=What is relativism?|work=CARM - The Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry}}</ref> Likewise, [[syncretism]], the attempt to take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of inter-religious dialogue.

In the ''[[Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n]]'' (''Book of Certitude''), Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h explains that messengers of God have a twofold station, one of divinity and one of an individual. According to Bah\u00e1'\u00ed writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years. There is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their religious figures.\n\n==Buddhism==\nThe earliest reference to Buddhist views on religious pluralism in a political sense is found in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of Emperor Ashoka]]:\n\n<blockquote>All religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart. Rock Edict Nb7 (S. Dhammika)</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Contact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions. Rock Edict Nb12 (S. Dhammika)</blockquote>\n\nWhen asked, \"Don\u2019t all religions teach the same thing? Is it possible to unify them?\" the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] said:<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-8376?l=english ''Dalai Lama Asks West Not to Turn Buddhism Into a \"Fashion\"''], Zenit, 2003-10-08, retrieved 2009-06-18.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nPeople from different traditions should keep their own, rather than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, so he can follow it. Some Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. But think about it carefully. Don\u2019t do it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then nothing.\n\nIn the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something Buddhist, something, something\u2026 That is not healthy.\n\nFor individual practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several truths, several religions, is contradictory.\n\nI am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend, Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, [Islam] is the only truth, the only religion.

Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances; in the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Era]], as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and games (''[[ludi]])''.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246.</ref> [[Women in Ancient Rome|Women]], [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported [[Vestal Virgins]], who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|disbanded under Christian persecution and domination]].\n\nThe Romans are known for the [[List of Roman deities|great number of deities]] they honored. The presence of [[Magna Graecia|Greeks on the Italian peninsula]] from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of [[Apollo]]. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks, adapting [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. [[Etruscan religion]] was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury, since Rome had once been ruled by Etruscan kings.\n\n[[Mystery religions]] imported from the [[Near East]] ([[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Parthian Empire|Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]), which offered initiates [[Soteriology|salvation through a personal God]] and [[Afterlife|eternal life after the death]], were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's [[Sacra gentilicia|family rites]] and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]\", conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional Roman morality and unity, as with the [[Roman senate|Senate]]'s efforts to [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|restrict the Bacchanals]] in 186 BC.\n\n[[File:0 Relief repr\u00e9sentant Mithra - Louvre-Lens (2).JPG|thumb|250px|right|Marble relief of [[Tauroctony|Mithras slaying the bull]] (2nd century, [[Louvre-Lens]]); [[Mithraism]] was among the most widespread [[mystery religions]] of the Roman Empire.<ref>G.

[[Roman Catholic]]s, Orthodox Christians, [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]s and most Protestant Christian denominations still maintain this belief. Furthermore, the [[Catholic Church]] makes the claim that it alone is the [[one true church|one and only true Church]] founded by [[Jesus Christ]], but the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches also make this claim in respect to themselves.\n\nChurch unity for these groups, as in the past, is something very visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy. Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox Sacraments as valid but illicit and without canonical jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of \"validity\" when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the ''form'' of Roman Catholic Sacraments to be acceptable, and there is some recognition of Catholic sacraments among some, but not all, Orthodox. Both generally mutually regard each other as \"[[heresy|heterodox]]\" and \"[[schism]]atic\", while continuing to recognize each other as Christian, at least [[secundum quid]]. (See [[ecumenicism]]).\n\n===Modern Christian views===\nSome other Protestants hold that only believers who believe in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the gift of salvation.  They continue to believe in \"one\" church, an \"invisible church\" which encompasses different types of Christians in different sects and denominations, believing in certain issues they deem fundamental, while disunited on a variety of doctrines they deem non-fundamental. Some [[evangelical]] Protestants are doubtful if Roman Catholics or Eastern Orthodox can possibly be members of this \"invisible church\", and usually they reject religious (typically [[restorationist]]) movements rooted in 19th century American Christianity, such as [[Mormonism]], [[Christian Science]], or [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] as not distinctly Christian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apologeticsindex.org/d01b.html#prot |title=The Protestant Principle |website=A Biblical Guide To Orthodoxy And Heresy |access-date=February 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]], unlike some Protestant denominations, affirms \"developmental theology,\" understood to mean that the \"[[Holy Spirit]], in and through the evolving and often confused circumstances of concrete history, is gradually bringing the Church to an ever more mature understanding of the [[deposit of faith]] (the saving truths entrusted by Jesus Christ to the Apostles--these as such cannot be changed or added to). The Church comes to recognize [[baptism of desire]] quite early in its history. Later, the Church realizes that Romans 2:14-16, for example, allows for the salvation of non-Christians who do not have unobstructed exposure to Christian teachings: \"When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires . . . . They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts . . . .<ref>See Robert Magliola, ''Facing Up to Real Doctrinal Difference: How Some Thought-Motifs from Derrida Can Nourish the Catholic-Buddhist Encounter'' (Angelico P., 2014), pp. 101-102.</ref> Various forms of \"implicit faith\" come to hold standing, until at [[Vatican Council II]], the Church declares: \"Nor shall divine providence deny the assistance necessary for salvation to those who, without any fault of theirs, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God, and who, not without grace, strive to lead a good life\" (#16). Vatican Council II in its Declaration [[Nostra aetate]] addresses the non-Christian religions with respect and appreciation, affirming the goodness found in them. Since Vatican Council II, Catholic dialogists in particular are working out the implications of [[John Paul II]]'s statement, in [[Redemptor hominis]] #6 that Christians should recognize \"the Holy Spirit operating outside the visible confines of the [[Mystical Body of Christ]].\" Among these dialogists, [[Robert Magliola]], an affiliate of the Italian community \"Vangelo e Zen\" (\"The Gospel and Zen\"), Desio and Milano, Italy, who taught in predominantly Buddhist cultures for years, and practiced Buddhist-Catholic dialogue there and in the West, and who is widely published in this dialogue, argues the following:\n</blockquote>\nIf God has willed that all persons be saved (see [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] #851, quoting 1 Tim. 2:4) but has not sent the opportunity of Christian conversion to all, how can we not conclude that God wills those good Buddhists in this latter category to live, flourish, and die as good Buddhists? That God in His providence--at least for now--wants Buddhism to be the setting for millions of good and noble people in the world? (This does not mean that Catholics should not witness to the Catholic faith or even--on the proper occasions and in a courteous way--consider it their duty to preach Catholicism to Buddhists, and to teach it mightily. But it does mean that Catholics would do well to remember that God alone sends the grace of conversion when and to whom He wills.)<ref>Robert Magliola, ''Facing Up  to Real Doctrinal Difference: How Some Thought-Motifs from Derrida Can Nourish the Catholic-Buddhist Encounter'' (Angelico P., 2014), p. 116 and p. 142, where he applies the same reasoning to relations with other non-Christian religions.</ref>\n\n</blockquote>\n\n==Hinduism==\n{{See also|Hinduism and other religions}}\n[[Hinduism]] is naturally pluralistic.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} A well-known ''[[Rig Veda|Rig Vedic]]'' hymn says: \"Truth is One, though the sages know it variously\" (''\u00c9kam sat vipra bahud\u0101 vadanti'').<ref>Rig Veda 1.164.46</ref> Similarly, in the ''[[Bhagavad Gita|Bhagavad G\u012bt\u0101]]'' (4:11), God, manifesting as an incarnation, states: \"As people approach me, so I receive them.

These verses have been interpreted to imply pluralism in religions.

To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. '''If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people''', but His plan is to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute; And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee.

({{cite quran|3|62|end=66|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSurah Al-Kafiroon verse 1 through 6 state:\n{{quote\n|Say : O ye that reject Faith! I worship not that which ye worship, nor will ye worship that which I worship. And I will not worship that which ye have been wont to worship, nor will ye worship that which I worship. To you be your Way, and to me mine. ({{cite quran|109|1|end=6|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSeveral verses of the [[Quran]]  state that Islam rejects religious pluralism. For example, Surah Al-Tawba verse 1 through 5 seems to command the Muslim to slay the [[pagan]]s (with verse 9.5 called the 'sword verse'):<ref name=mb/> \n{{quote|\nA (declaration) of immunity from Allah and His Messenger, to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances:- Go ye, then, for four months, backwards and forwards, (as ye will), throughout the land, but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him. And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith. But when the forbidden months are past, '''then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them''', seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war; but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. ({{cite quran|9|1|end=5|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nHowever, this verse has been explained.<ref>Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53, emphasis added</ref>\n{{quote|\n. Hostilities were frozen for a three-month period during which the Arabs pledged not to wage war. Prophet Muhammad was inspired to use this period to encourage the combatants to join the Muslim ranks or, if they chose, to leave the area that was under Muslims rule; '''however, if they were to resume hostilities, then the Muslims would fight back until victorious.''' One is inspired to note that even in this context of war, the verse concludes by emphasizing the divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness. To minimize hostilities, the Qur'an ordered Muslims to grant asylum to anyone, even an enemy, who sought refuge. Asylum would be granted according to the customs of chivalry; the person would be told the message of the Qur'an but not coerced into accepting that message. Thereafter, he or she would be escorted to safety regardless of his or her religion. (9:6).({{cite Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53| style=nosup}}) }}\n\nBernard Lewis presents some of his conclusions about [[Islamic culture]], [[Shari'a]] law, [[jihad]], and the modern day phenomenon of terrorism in his text, ''Islam: The Religion and the People''.{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=145\u2013150}} He writes of jihad as a distinct \"religious obligation\", but suggests that \"it is a pity\" that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion:\n{{quote|\nMuslim fighters are commanded not to kill women, children, or the aged unless they attack first; not to torture or otherwise ill-treat prisoners; to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities or their resumption after a truce; and to honor agreements. ... At no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays.\"{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=151}}}}\n\nIn Surah Al-Tawba, verse 29 demands Muslims to fight all those who do not believe in Islam, including Christians and Jews (People of the Book), until they pay the [[Jizya]], a tax, with willing submission.\n{{quote|\nFight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, '''even if they are of the People of the Book''', until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. ({{cite quran|9|29|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSome people have  concluded from verse 9:29, that Muslims are commanded to attack all non-Muslims until they pay money, but Shaykh Jalal Abualrub writes:\n{{quote|\nThese Ayat (Quranic verses) stress the necessity of fighting against the People of the Scripture, but under what conditions? We previously established the fact that the Islamic State is not permitted to attack non-Muslims who are not hostile to Islam, who do not oppress Muslims, or try to convert Muslims by force from their religion, or expel them from their lands, or wage war against them, or prepare for attacks against them. If any of these offenses occurs, however, Muslims are permitted to defend themselves and protect their religion. Muslims are not permitted to attack non-Muslims who signed peace pacts with them, or non-Muslims who live under the protection of the Islamic State.({{source=Abualrub, Holy Wars, Crusades, Jihad}}) }}\n\nIn Surah Al-Nisa, verse 89 has been misquoted to seem that it says to slay the [[Apostasy|apostates]]. In actuality, it only commands Muslims to fight those who practice oppression or persecution, or attack the Muslims.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n{{quote|\nWhy should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? Allah hath upset them for their (evil) deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way? For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way, never shalt thou find the Way.

But if they revert to [open] enmity, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks. Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (Of peace), or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people.

Sufism is defined by the Sufi master or [[Pir (Sufism)]] or [[fakeer]] or [[Wali]] in the language of the people by dancing and singing and incorporating various philosophies, theologies, ideologies and religions together (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Paganism, Platonism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so forth with time). Famous Sufi masters are [[Rumi]], [[Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili|Shadhili]], [[Sheikh Farid]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Waris Shah]], [[Ghazali]], [[Mian Mir]], [[Attar of Nishapur]], [[Amir Khusrow]], [[Salim Chishti]]. See many more famous Sufis at the [[List of Sufis]]. The Sufis were considered by many to have divine revelations with messages of peace, tolerance, equality, pluralism, love for all and hate for no one, humanitarians, philosophers, psychologists and much more. Many had the teaching if you want to change the world, change yourself and you will change the whole world. The views of the Sufi poets, philosophers and theologians have inspired multiple forms of modern-day academia as well as philosophers of other religions. See also [[Blind men and an elephant]]. But undoubtedly, the most influential Sufi scholar to have embraced the world is Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi. He was born in 1207 AD in a northern province of Afghanistan, however, he later had to seek refuge in Turkey following the invasion of Afghanistan by Mongols.<ref>http://registan.net/2007/11/12/rumi-the-alchemist-of-interfaith-tolerance/</ref> Rumi, through his poetry and teachings, propagated inter-faith harmony like none other.  He served as a uniting figure for people of different faiths and his followers included Muslims, Christians and Jews. Even today, Rumi\u2019s popularity does not cease to exist within the Sufi Muslim community and his message of peace and harmony transcends religious and geographical boundaries.\n\nRumi says:\n<blockquote>\nI looked for God. I went to a temple, and I didn't find him there. Then I went to a church, and I didn't find him there. And then I went to a mosque, and I didn't find him there. And then finally I looked in my heart, and there he was. \n</blockquote>\n\nRumi also says:\n<blockquote>\nHow many paths are there to God? There are as many paths to God as there are souls on the Earth.\n</blockquote>\n\nRumi also says:\n <blockquote>\nA true Lover doesn't follow any one religion,\nbe sure of that.\nSince in the religion of Love,\nthere is no irreverence or faith.\nWhen in Love,\nbody, mind, heart and soul don't even exist.\nBecome this,\nfall in Love,\nand you will not be separated again.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Ahmadiyya===\n{{See also|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}\nAhmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the [[Quran]], every nation in the history of mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: ''And there is a guide for every people''. Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of Islam, [[Muhammad]] states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from theological study also recognize [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], founders of [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]] to be divinely appointed individuals.\n\nThe Second [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad|Khalifatul Maish]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] writes:\n\"According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America\u2014all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur\u2019an\" by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad.

In this view, the truth or the reality is perceived differently from different points of view, and no single point of view is the complete truth.<ref>Dundas (2002) p.231</ref><ref>Koller, John M. (July, 2000) pp.400-7</ref> Jain doctrine states that an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans. Only the [[Kevala Jnana|Kevalins]]\u2014the omniscient beings\u2014can comprehend the object in all its aspects and manifestations, and all others are capable of knowing only a part of it.<ref>Jaini, Padmanabh (1998) p.91</ref> Consequently, no one view can claim to represent the absolute truth\u2014only relative truths. Jains compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with  '' andhgajnyaya '' or the \"[[Blind men and an elephant|maxim of the blind men and elephant]]\", wherein all the blind men claimed to explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed due to their narrow perspective.<ref name = hughes>Hughes, Marilynn (2005) p.590-1</ref> For Jains, the problem with the blind men is not that they claim to explain the true appearance of the elephant; the problem is doing so to the exclusion of all other claims. Since absolute truth is many-sided, embracing any truth to the exclusion of others is to commit the error of ''ek\u0101nta'' (one-sidedness).<ref name=\"The Metaphysics of Paradox\">{{cite book |last1=Schwartz |first1=Wm.

First and the second commandment, you shall not have another God except me, worship your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Throughout the Hebrew Bible the sovereignty of Yahweh as the only God is the key pillar of a chosen community of Israel.\n\n==Sikhism==\n{{See|Islam and Sikhism|Hinduism and Sikhism}}\nThe [[Sikh gurus]] have propagated the message of \"many paths\" leading to the [[Ek Onkar|one God]] and ultimate [[salvation]] for all souls who treading on the path of [[righteousness]]. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the [[Lord]], can certainly achieve salvation. Sikhs are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had many interactions with [[Sufism]] as well as [[Hinduism]], influenced them and was influenced by them.\n\nThe [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], the holy book of the [[Sikh]]s, says:\n{{quote|Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false. Those who do not contemplate them are false.|  Guru Granth Sahib page 1350<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=1350&english=t&id=57718|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib|work=srigranth.org}}</ref>}}\n\nAs well as:\n<blockquote>\nSome call the Lord \"Ram, Ram\", and some \"Khuda\". Some serve Him as \"Gusain\", others as \"Allah\". He is the Cause of causes, and Generous. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. Some pilgrims bathe at sacred shrines, others go on Hajj to Mecca. Some do devotional worship, whilst others bow their heads in prayer.  Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran.  Some wear blue robes, and some wear white.  Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will, knows the secrets of his Lord Master. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib Page:885)<ref>{{cite web|title=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?ction=Page&g=1&h=1&r=1&t=1&p=0&k=0&Param=885|work=sggs ram khudha people pray to there god|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref> \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>\nOne who recognizes that all spiritual paths lead to the One shall be emancipated.

(Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13)\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib also says that [[Bhagat Namdev]] and [[Kabir|Bhagat Kabir]], who were both believed to be [[Hindu]]s, both attained salvation though they were born before [[Sikhism]] took root and were clearly not Sikhs. This highlights and reinforces the Guru's saying that \"peoples of other faiths\" can join with God as true and also at the same time signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation.\n\nAdditionally the Guru Granth Sahib says:\n<blockquote>\nFirst, Allah (God) created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings. From the One Light, the entire universe welled up. So who is good, and who is bad? ||1|| \n<ref>{{cite web|title=aval allah|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&Param=1349&english=t&id=57707#l57707|work=aval allah}}</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nAgain, the Guru Granth Sahib Ji provides this verse:\n<blockquote>\n[[Bhagat Namdev|Naam Dayv]] the printer, and [[Kabir|Kabeer]] the weaver, obtained salvation through the Perfect Guru. Those who know God and recognize His [[Shabda|Shabad]] (\"word\") lose their ego and class consciousness.

He recognised that religious labels held no value and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call ourselves religiously holds no value.\n\nSikhs have been considered eager exponents of [[interfaith dialogue]] and not only accept the right of others to practice their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect this right for others; the [[Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar]], who on the pleas of a [[pandit]] of the [[Kashmiris]], agreed to fight against a tyrannic [[Moghul Empire]] (that was forcing them to convert to Islam) in order that they might gain the freedom to practice their religion, which differed from his own.\n\n==Religious pluralism and human service professions==\nThe concept of religious pluralism is also relevant to human service professions, such as psychology and social work, as well as medicine and nursing, in which trained professionals may interact with clients from diverse faith traditions.<ref name=p97/><ref name=zp>Brian J.

New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-664-6}}</ref> has described four possible stances toward client religious and spiritual beliefs, which he called ''rejectionist'', ''exclusivist'', ''constructivist'', and ''pluralist''. Unlike the constructivist stance, the pluralist stance:\n\n<blockquote>\n...recognizes the existence of a religious or spiritual absolute reality but allows for multiple interpretations and paths toward it. In contrast to the exclusivist who maintains that there is a single path \"up the mountain of God,\" the pluralist recognizes many paths as valid. Although both the exclusivist and the pluralist may agree on the existence of religious or spiritual reality, the pluralist recognizes that this reality is expressed in different cultures and by different people in different ways. Because humans are mortal and limited, a single human religious system cannot encompass all of the religious or spiritual absolute reality.... (p. 167)<ref name=zp/>\n</blockquote>\n\nImportantly, \"the pluralistic therapist can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely affecting therapy\" (p.&nbsp;168).<ref name=zp/> The stances implied by these four helping orientations on several key issues, such as \"should religious issues be discussed in counseling?\", have also been presented in tabular form (p.&nbsp;362, Table 12.1).<ref name=p97/>\n\nThe profession of [[chaplain]]cy, a religious profession, must also deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For example, Friberg (2001) argues: \"With growing populations of immigrants and adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost respect for the residents' spiritual and religious histories and orientations is imperative\" (p.&nbsp;182).<ref name=nf>Nils Friberg (2001).

This is called ''Perennialism'' (based on the concept of ''[[Perennial philosophy|philosophia perennis]]'') or [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalism]].\n* Sometimes as a synonym for [[ecumenism]], i.e., the promotion of some level of unity, co-operation, and improved understanding between different religions or different [[Religious denomination|denomination]]s within a single religion.\n* As a term for the condition of harmonious co-existence between adherents of different [[religion]]s or [[religious denomination]]s.\n*As a [[social norm]] and not merely a synonym for religious diversity.<ref name=\"Silk 64\u201381\">{{Citation | last = Silk | first = Mark| title = Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis | volume = 612 | pages = 64\u201381\n  | date = July 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Definition and scopes==\n{{Main|Religious tolerance}}\n[[File:Kazan church.jpg|thumb|[[Temple of All Religions]] in [[Kazan]], [[Russia]] ]]\n[[File:1893parliament.jpg|thumb|Congress of [[Parliament of the World's Religions]], [[Chicago]], 1893]]\n\nReligious pluralism, to paraphrase the title of a recent academic work, goes beyond mere toleration. Chris Beneke, in ''Beyond Toleration: The Religious Origins of American Pluralism'', explains the difference between religious tolerance and religious pluralism by pointing to the situation in the late 18th century [[United States]]. By the 1730s, in most colonies religious minorities had obtained what contemporaries called [[religious tolerance|religious toleration]]:<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\">Beneke 2006: 6.</ref> \"The policy of toleration relieved religious minorities of some physical punishments and some financial burdens, but it did not make them free from the indignities of prejudice and exclusion. Nor did it make them equal. Those 'tolerated' could still be barred from civil offices, military positions, and university posts.\"<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\"/> In short, religious toleration is only the absence of [[religious persecution]], and does not necessarily preclude [[religious discrimination]]. However, in the following decades something extraordinary happened in the [[Thirteen Colonies]], at least if one views the events from \"a late eighteenth-century perspective\".<ref name=\"Beneke06-5\">Beneke 2006: 5.</ref> Gradually the colonial governments expanded the policy of religious toleration, but then, between the 1760s and the 1780s, they replaced it with \"something that is usually called [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]]\".<ref name=\"Beneke06-6\"/> Mark Silka, in \"Defining Religious Pluralism in America: A Regional Analysis\", states that Religious pluralism \"enables a country made up of people of different faiths to exist without sectarian warfare or the persecution of religious minorities. Understood differently in different times and places, it is a [[cultural construct]] that embodies some shared conception of how a country's various religious communities relate to each other and to the larger nation whole.\"<ref name=\"Silk 64\u201381\"/>\n\nReligious pluralism can be defined as \"respecting the otherness of others\". Freedom of religion encompasses all religions acting within the law in a particular region. [[Exclusivist]] religions teach that theirs is the only way to salvation and to religious truth, and some of them would even argue that it is necessary to suppress the falsehoods taught by other religions. Some [[Protestant]] [[sect]]s argue fiercely against [[Roman Catholicism]], and [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christians]] of all kinds teach that religious practices like those of [[Paganism]] and [[witchcraft]] are pernicious. This was a common historical attitude prior to the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and has appeared as governmental policy into the present day under systems like [[Afghanistan]]'s [[Taliban]] regime, which destroyed the ancient [[Buddhas of Bamyan]].\n\nGiving one religion or denomination special rights that are denied to others can weaken religious pluralism. This situation was observed in Europe through the [[Lateran Treaty]] and [[Church of England]]. In modern era, many Islamic countries have laws that criminalize the act of leaving Islam to someone born in Muslim family, forbid entry to non-Muslims into Mosques, and forbid construction of Church, Synagogue or Temples inside their countries.<ref name=meister>Chad Meister (2010), The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp 32-57</ref>\n\n[[Relativism]], the belief that all religions are equal in their value and that none of the religions give access to absolute truth, is an extreme form of [[inclusivism]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://carm.org/what-relativism|title=What is relativism?|work=CARM - The Christian Apologetics & Research Ministry}}</ref> Likewise, [[syncretism]], the attempt to take over creeds of practices from other religions or even to blend practices or creeds from different religions into one new faith is an extreme form of inter-religious dialogue. [[Syncretism]] must not be confused with [[ecumenism]], the attempt to bring closer and eventually reunite different denominations of one religion that have a common origin but were separated by a [[Schism (religion)|schism]].\n\n==History==\n{{Main|History of religious pluralism}}\n[[File:Druck Augsburger Reichsfrieden.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Front page of the 1555 [[Peace of Augsburg]], which recognized two different churches in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].]]\n[[Cultural pluralism|Cultural]] and religious pluralism has a long history and development that reaches from antiquity to contemporary trends in [[post-modernity]].\n\nGerman philosophers of religion [[Ludwig Feuerbach]] and [[Ernst Troeltsch]] concluded that [[Eastern religions|Asian religious traditions]], in particular [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], were the earliest proponents of religious pluralism and granting of [[Freedom of religion|freedom to the individuals to choose their own faith]] and develop a personal religious construct within it<ref name=meister2/><ref>Roof & McKinney (1985), ''Denominational America and the new religious pluralism'', The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science, 480(1), pp. 24-38</ref> (see also [[Buddhism and Hinduism|Relationship between Buddhism and Hinduism]]); [[Jainism]], another [[Indian religions|ancient Indian religion]], as well as [[Daoism]] have also always been inclusively flexible and have long favored religious pluralism for those who disagree with their religious viewpoints.<ref name=meister2>Chad Meister (2010), ''The Oxford Handbook of Religious Diversity'', Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195340136}}, pp. 62-72</ref> The [[Age of Enlightenment]] in Europe triggered a sweeping transformation about religion after the [[French Revolution]] ([[liberalism]], [[democracy]], [[civil and political rights]], [[freedom of thought]], [[separation of Church and State]], [[secularization]]), with rising acceptance of religious pluralism and [[decline of Christianity]]. According to Chad Meister,<ref name=meister2/> these pluralist trends in the Western thought, particularly since the 18th century, brought mainstream Christianity and Judaism closer to the Asian traditions of philosophical pluralism and religious tolerance.\n\n==Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith==\n[[File:Religions 4x5.png|thumb|1st row: [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], [[Buddhism]], [[Cao Dai]], [[Christianity]]<br />2nd row: [[Druidism]], [[Eckankar]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]]<br />3rd row: [[Jainism]], [[Judaism]], [[Ra\u00eblism]], [[Satanism]]<br />4th row: [[Shinto]], [[Sikhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Tenrikyo]]<br />5th row: [[Thelema]], [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Wicca]], [[Zoroastrianism]]]]\n\n{{Main|Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith and the unity of religion}}\n[[Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h]], founder of [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]], a religion that developed in Persia, though not a sect of Islam,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.org/islam-bahai/SectIslam.htm|title=Not a Sect|work=bci.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051215112206/http://bci.org/islam-bahai/SectIslam.htm|archivedate=2005-12-15}}</ref> urged the elimination of religious intolerance. He taught that God is one, and has manifested himself to humanity through several historic messengers.

In this view, God's word is revealed through a series of messengers: [[Abraham]], [[Krishna]], [[Moses]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[Jesus]], [[Muhammad]], and Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h (the founder of the [[Bah\u00e1'\u00ed Faith]]) among them. In the ''[[Kit\u00e1b-i-\u00cdq\u00e1n]]'' (''Book of Certitude''), Bah\u00e1'u'll\u00e1h explains that messengers of God have a twofold station, one of divinity and one of an individual. According to Bah\u00e1'\u00ed writings, there will not be another messenger for many hundreds of years. There is also a respect for the religious traditions of the native peoples of the planet who may have little other than oral traditions as a record of their religious figures.\n\n==Buddhism==\nThe earliest reference to Buddhist views on religious pluralism in a political sense is found in the [[Edicts of Ashoka|Edicts of Emperor Ashoka]]:\n\n<blockquote>All religions should reside everywhere, for all of them desire self-control and purity of heart. Rock Edict Nb7 (S. Dhammika)</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote>Contact (between religions) is good. One should listen to and respect the doctrines professed by others. Beloved-of-the-Gods, King Piyadasi, desires that all should be well-learned in the good doctrines of other religions. Rock Edict Nb12 (S. Dhammika)</blockquote>\n\nWhen asked, \"Don\u2019t all religions teach the same thing? Is it possible to unify them?\" the [[14th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] said:<ref>[http://www.zenit.org/article-8376?l=english ''Dalai Lama Asks West Not to Turn Buddhism Into a \"Fashion\"''], Zenit, 2003-10-08, retrieved 2009-06-18.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>\nPeople from different traditions should keep their own, rather than change. However, some Tibetan may prefer Islam, so he can follow it. Some Spanish prefer Buddhism; so follow it. But think about it carefully. Don\u2019t do it for fashion. Some people start Christian, follow Islam, then Buddhism, then nothing.\n\nIn the United States I have seen people who embrace Buddhism and change their clothes! Like the New Age. They take something Hindu, something Buddhist, something, something\u2026 That is not healthy.\n\nFor individual practitioners, having one truth, one religion, is very important. Several truths, several religions, is contradictory.\n\nI am Buddhist. Therefore, Buddhism is the only truth for me, the only religion. To my Christian friend, Christianity is the only truth, the only religion. To my Muslim friend, [Islam] is the only truth, the only religion. In the meantime, I respect and admire my Christian friend and my Muslim friend. If by unifying you mean mixing, that is impossible; useless.\n</blockquote>\n\n==Classical civilization: Greek and Roman religions==\n{{See also|Ancient Greek religion|Greco-Roman mysteries|Paganism|Pax deorum}}\n\nFor the Romans, [[Religion in Ancient Rome|religion was part of the daily life]].<ref>[[J\u00f6rg R\u00fcpke]], \"Roman Religion \u2013 Religions of Rome,\" in ''A Companion to Roman Religion'' (Blackwell, 2007), p. 4.</ref> Each home had a household shrine at which prayers and [[libation]]s to the family's domestic deities were offered. Neighborhood shrines and sacred places such as springs and groves dotted the city. The [[Roman calendar]] was structured around religious observances; in the [[Roman Empire|Imperial Era]], as many as 135 days of the year were devoted to [[Roman festivals|religious festivals]] and games (''[[ludi]])''.<ref>Matthew Bunson, ''A Dictionary of the Roman Empire'' (Oxford University Press, 1995), p. 246.</ref> [[Women in Ancient Rome|Women]], [[Slavery in ancient Rome|slaves]], and children all participated in a range of religious activities. Some public rituals could be conducted only by women, and women formed what is perhaps Rome's most famous priesthood, the state-supported [[Vestal Virgins]], who tended Rome's sacred hearth for centuries, until [[Persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire|disbanded under Christian persecution and domination]].\n\nThe Romans are known for the [[List of Roman deities|great number of deities]] they honored. The presence of [[Magna Graecia|Greeks on the Italian peninsula]] from the beginning of the historical period influenced Roman culture, introducing some religious practices that became as fundamental as the cult of [[Apollo]]. The Romans looked for common ground between their major gods and those of the Greeks, adapting [[Greek mythology|Greek myths]] and iconography for Latin literature and Roman art. [[Etruscan religion]] was also a major influence, particularly on the practice of augury, since Rome had once been ruled by Etruscan kings.\n\n[[Mystery religions]] imported from the [[Near East]] ([[Ptolemaic Egypt]], [[Parthian Empire|Persia]] and [[Mesopotamia]]), which offered initiates [[Soteriology|salvation through a personal God]] and [[Afterlife|eternal life after the death]], were a matter of personal choice for an individual, practiced in addition to carrying on one's [[Sacra gentilicia|family rites]] and participating in public religion. The mysteries, however, involved exclusive oaths and secrecy, conditions that conservative Romans viewed with suspicion as characteristic of \"[[Magic in the Greco-Roman world|magic]]\", conspiracy (''coniuratio''), and subversive activity. Sporadic and sometimes brutal attempts were made to suppress religionists who seemed to threaten traditional Roman morality and unity, as with the [[Roman senate|Senate]]'s efforts to [[Senatus consultum de Bacchanalibus|restrict the Bacchanals]] in 186 BC.\n\n[[File:0 Relief repr\u00e9sentant Mithra - Louvre-Lens (2).JPG|thumb|250px|right|Marble relief of [[Tauroctony|Mithras slaying the bull]] (2nd century, [[Louvre-Lens]]); [[Mithraism]] was among the most widespread [[mystery religions]] of the Roman Empire.<ref>G.

Inscriptions throughout the Empire record the side-by-side worship of local and Roman deities, including dedications made by Romans to local Gods.<ref>Janet Huskinson, ''Experiencing Rome: Culture, Identity and Power in the Roman Empire'' (Routledge, 2000), p. 261.</ref> By the height of the Empire, numerous [[Interpretatio graeca|international deities]] were cultivated at Rome and had been carried to even the most remote [[Roman provinces|provinces]] (among them [[Cybele]], [[Isis]], [[Osiris]], [[Serapis]], [[Epona]]), and Gods of [[Monism|solar monism]] such as [[Mithras]] and [[Sol Invictus]], found as far north as [[Roman Britain]]. Because Romans had never been obligated to cultivate one deity or one cult only, [[religious tolerance]] was not an issue in the sense that it is for competing [[Monotheism|monotheistic religions]].<ref>A classic essay on this topic is [[Arnaldo Momigliano]], \"The Disadvantages of Monotheism for a Universal State\", in ''Classical Philology'', 81.4 (1986), pp. 285\u2013297.</ref> The monotheistic rigor of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Judaism]] posed difficulties for Roman policy that led at times to compromise and the granting of special exemptions, but sometimes to intractable conflict.\n\n==Christianity==\n{{Main|Christianity and other religions}}\n{{See also|Ecumenism}}\nSome Christians<ref>[http://www.christians.eu/why-jesus/ Why Jesus?] Article stating that Jesus is the saviour and not Mohammed or Buddha\u2014see second part of this article.</ref> have argued that religious pluralism is an invalid or self-contradictory concept.\n\nMaximal forms of religious pluralism claim that all religions are equally true, or that one religion can be true for some and another for others.

Jones |publisher=[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] |magazine=[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date=October 1977}}</ref>\n\n===Classical Christian views===\nBefore the [[East-West Schism|Great Schism]], mainstream Christianity confessed \"one holy catholic and apostolic church\", in the words of the [[Nicene Creed]]. [[Roman Catholic]]s, Orthodox Christians, [[Anglicanism|Episcopalian]]s and most Protestant Christian denominations still maintain this belief. Furthermore, the [[Catholic Church]] makes the claim that it alone is the [[one true church|one and only true Church]] founded by [[Jesus Christ]], but the [[Eastern Orthodox]] and [[Oriental Orthodox]] Churches also make this claim in respect to themselves.\n\nChurch unity for these groups, as in the past, is something very visible and tangible, and schism was just as serious an offense as heresy. Following the Great Schism, Roman Catholicism sees and recognizes the Orthodox Sacraments as valid but illicit and without canonical jurisdiction. Eastern Orthodoxy does not have the concept of \"validity\" when applied to Sacraments, but it considers the ''form'' of Roman Catholic Sacraments to be acceptable, and there is some recognition of Catholic sacraments among some, but not all, Orthodox. Both generally mutually regard each other as \"[[heresy|heterodox]]\" and \"[[schism]]atic\", while continuing to recognize each other as Christian, at least [[secundum quid]]. (See [[ecumenicism]]).\n\n===Modern Christian views===\nSome other Protestants hold that only believers who believe in certain fundamental doctrines know the true pathway to salvation. The core of this doctrine is that Jesus Christ was a perfect man, is the Son of God and that he died and rose again for the wrongdoing of those who will accept the gift of salvation.  They continue to believe in \"one\" church, an \"invisible church\" which encompasses different types of Christians in different sects and denominations, believing in certain issues they deem fundamental, while disunited on a variety of doctrines they deem non-fundamental. Some [[evangelical]] Protestants are doubtful if Roman Catholics or Eastern Orthodox can possibly be members of this \"invisible church\", and usually they reject religious (typically [[restorationist]]) movements rooted in 19th century American Christianity, such as [[Mormonism]], [[Christian Science]], or [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] as not distinctly Christian.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://apologeticsindex.org/d01b.html#prot |title=The Protestant Principle |website=A Biblical Guide To Orthodoxy And Heresy |access-date=February 7, 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Catholic Church]], unlike some Protestant denominations, affirms \"developmental theology,\" understood to mean that the \"[[Holy Spirit]], in and through the evolving and often confused circumstances of concrete history, is gradually bringing the Church to an ever more mature understanding of the [[deposit of faith]] (the saving truths entrusted by Jesus Christ to the Apostles--these as such cannot be changed or added to). The Church comes to recognize [[baptism of desire]] quite early in its history. Later, the Church realizes that Romans 2:14-16, for example, allows for the salvation of non-Christians who do not have unobstructed exposure to Christian teachings: \"When Gentiles who have not the law do by nature what the law requires . . . . They show that what the law requires is written on their hearts . . . .<ref>See Robert Magliola, ''Facing Up to Real Doctrinal Difference: How Some Thought-Motifs from Derrida Can Nourish the Catholic-Buddhist Encounter'' (Angelico P., 2014), pp. 101-102.</ref> Various forms of \"implicit faith\" come to hold standing, until at [[Vatican Council II]], the Church declares: \"Nor shall divine providence deny the assistance necessary for salvation to those who, without any fault of theirs, have not yet arrived at an explicit knowledge of God, and who, not without grace, strive to lead a good life\" (#16). Vatican Council II in its Declaration [[Nostra aetate]] addresses the non-Christian religions with respect and appreciation, affirming the goodness found in them. Since Vatican Council II, Catholic dialogists in particular are working out the implications of [[John Paul II]]'s statement, in [[Redemptor hominis]] #6 that Christians should recognize \"the Holy Spirit operating outside the visible confines of the [[Mystical Body of Christ]].\" Among these dialogists, [[Robert Magliola]], an affiliate of the Italian community \"Vangelo e Zen\" (\"The Gospel and Zen\"), Desio and Milano, Italy, who taught in predominantly Buddhist cultures for years, and practiced Buddhist-Catholic dialogue there and in the West, and who is widely published in this dialogue, argues the following:\n</blockquote>\nIf God has willed that all persons be saved (see [[Catechism of the Catholic Church]] #851, quoting 1 Tim. 2:4) but has not sent the opportunity of Christian conversion to all, how can we not conclude that God wills those good Buddhists in this latter category to live, flourish, and die as good Buddhists? That God in His providence--at least for now--wants Buddhism to be the setting for millions of good and noble people in the world?

These verses have been interpreted to imply pluralism in religions. For example, [[Al-Ma'ida|Surah Al-Ma'idah]] verses 47 through 49 state:\n{{quote\n|Let the people of the Gospel judge by what Allah hath revealed therein. If any do fail to judge by the light of what Allah hath revealed, they are no better than those who rebel. To thee We sent the Scripture in truth, confirming the scripture that came before it, and guarding it in safety: so judge between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, diverging from the Truth that hath come to thee. To each among you have we prescribed a law and an open way. '''If Allah had so willed, He would have made you a single people''', but His plan is to test you in what He hath given you: so strive as in a race in all virtues. The goal of you all is to Allah; it is He that will show you the truth of the matters in which ye dispute; And this (He commands): Judge thou between them by what Allah hath revealed, and follow not their vain desires, but beware of them lest they beguile thee from any of that (teaching) which Allah hath sent down to thee. And if they turn away, be assured that for some of their crime it is Allah's purpose to punish them. And truly most men are rebellious. ({{cite quran|5|47|end=49|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSurah Al-Ankabut verse 45 through 47 state:\n{{quote\n|Recite what is sent of the Book by inspiration to thee, and establish regular Prayer: for Prayer restrains from shameful and unjust deeds; and remembrance of Allah is the greatest thing in life without doubt. And Allah knows the deeds that ye do. And dispute ye not with the People of the Book, except with means better than mere disputation, unless it be with those of them who inflict wrong (and injury): but say, \"We believe in the revelation which has come down to us and in that which came down to you; '''Our Allah and your Allah is one'''; and it is to Him we bow in Islam.\" And thus it is that We have sent down the Book to thee. So the [[People of the Book]] believe therein, as also do some of these pagan Arabs: and none but Unbelievers reject our signs. ({{cite quran|29|45|end=47|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSurah Al-E-Imran verses 62 through 66 state:\n{{quote\n|This is the true account: There is no god except Allah; and Allah-He is indeed the Exalted in Power, the Wise. But if they turn back, Allah hath full knowledge of those who do mischief. Say: \"O People of the Book! '''come to common terms as between us and you: That we worship none but Allah'''; that we associate no partners with him; that we erect not, from among ourselves, Lords and patrons other than Allah.\" If then they turn back, say ye: \"Bear witness that we at least are Muslims bowing to Allah's Will. Ye People of the Book! Why dispute ye about Abraham, when the Law and the Gospel Were not revealed Till after him? Have ye no understanding? Ah! Ye are those who fell to disputing even in matters of which ye had some knowledge! but why dispute ye in matters of which ye have no knowledge? It is Allah Who knows, and ye who know not! ({{cite quran|3|62|end=66|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSurah Al-Kafiroon verse 1 through 6 state:\n{{quote\n|Say : O ye that reject Faith! I worship not that which ye worship, nor will ye worship that which I worship. And I will not worship that which ye have been wont to worship, nor will ye worship that which I worship. To you be your Way, and to me mine. ({{cite quran|109|1|end=6|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSeveral verses of the [[Quran]]  state that Islam rejects religious pluralism. For example, Surah Al-Tawba verse 1 through 5 seems to command the Muslim to slay the [[pagan]]s (with verse 9.5 called the 'sword verse'):<ref name=mb/> \n{{quote|\nA (declaration) of immunity from Allah and His Messenger, to those of the Pagans with whom ye have contracted mutual alliances:- Go ye, then, for four months, backwards and forwards, (as ye will), throughout the land, but know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah (by your falsehood) but that Allah will cover with shame those who reject Him. And an announcement from Allah and His Messenger, to the people (assembled) on the day of the Great Pilgrimage,- that Allah and His Messenger dissolve (treaty) obligations with the Pagans. If then, ye repent, it were best for you; but if ye turn away, know ye that ye cannot frustrate Allah. And proclaim a grievous penalty to those who reject Faith. But when the forbidden months are past, '''then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them''', seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem of war; but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them: for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful. ({{cite quran|9|1|end=5|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nHowever, this verse has been explained.<ref>Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53, emphasis added</ref>\n{{quote|\n. Hostilities were frozen for a three-month period during which the Arabs pledged not to wage war. Prophet Muhammad was inspired to use this period to encourage the combatants to join the Muslim ranks or, if they chose, to leave the area that was under Muslims rule; '''however, if they were to resume hostilities, then the Muslims would fight back until victorious.''' One is inspired to note that even in this context of war, the verse concludes by emphasizing the divine attributes of mercy and forgiveness. To minimize hostilities, the Qur'an ordered Muslims to grant asylum to anyone, even an enemy, who sought refuge. Asylum would be granted according to the customs of chivalry; the person would be told the message of the Qur'an but not coerced into accepting that message. Thereafter, he or she would be escorted to safety regardless of his or her religion. (9:6).({{cite Hathout, Jihad vs. Terrorism; US Multimedia Vera International, 2002, pp.52-53| style=nosup}}) }}\n\nBernard Lewis presents some of his conclusions about [[Islamic culture]], [[Shari'a]] law, [[jihad]], and the modern day phenomenon of terrorism in his text, ''Islam: The Religion and the People''.{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=145\u2013150}} He writes of jihad as a distinct \"religious obligation\", but suggests that \"it is a pity\" that people engaging in terrorist activities are not more aware of their own religion:\n{{quote|\nMuslim fighters are commanded not to kill women, children, or the aged unless they attack first; not to torture or otherwise ill-treat prisoners; to give fair warning of the opening of hostilities or their resumption after a truce; and to honor agreements. ... At no time did the classical jurists offer any approval or legitimacy to what we nowadays call terrorism. Nor indeed is there any evidence of the use of terrorism as it is practiced nowadays.\"{{sfn|Lewis|Churchill|2008|pp=151}}}}\n\nIn Surah Al-Tawba, verse 29 demands Muslims to fight all those who do not believe in Islam, including Christians and Jews (People of the Book), until they pay the [[Jizya]], a tax, with willing submission.\n{{quote|\nFight those who believe not in Allah nor the Last Day, nor hold that forbidden which hath been forbidden by Allah and His Messenger, nor acknowledge the religion of Truth, '''even if they are of the People of the Book''', until they pay the Jizya with willing submission, and feel themselves subdued. ({{cite quran|9|29|style=nosup}}) }}\n\nSome people have  concluded from verse 9:29, that Muslims are commanded to attack all non-Muslims until they pay money, but Shaykh Jalal Abualrub writes:\n{{quote|\nThese Ayat (Quranic verses) stress the necessity of fighting against the People of the Scripture, but under what conditions? We previously established the fact that the Islamic State is not permitted to attack non-Muslims who are not hostile to Islam, who do not oppress Muslims, or try to convert Muslims by force from their religion, or expel them from their lands, or wage war against them, or prepare for attacks against them. If any of these offenses occurs, however, Muslims are permitted to defend themselves and protect their religion. Muslims are not permitted to attack non-Muslims who signed peace pacts with them, or non-Muslims who live under the protection of the Islamic State.({{source=Abualrub, Holy Wars, Crusades, Jihad}}) }}\n\nIn Surah Al-Nisa, verse 89 has been misquoted to seem that it says to slay the [[Apostasy|apostates]]. In actuality, it only commands Muslims to fight those who practice oppression or persecution, or attack the Muslims.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n{{quote|\nWhy should ye be divided into two parties about the Hypocrites? Allah hath upset them for their (evil) deeds. Would ye guide those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way? For those whom Allah hath thrown out of the Way, never shalt thou find the Way. They but wish that ye should reject Faith, as they do, and thus be on the same footing (as they): so take not friends from their ranks until they forsake the domain of evil in the way of God (from what is forbidden). But if they revert to [open] enmity, seize them and slay them wherever ye find them; and (in any case) take no friends or helpers from their ranks. Except those who join a group between whom and you there is a treaty (Of peace), or those who approach you with hearts restraining them from fighting you as well as fighting their own people. If God had pleased, He could have given them power over you, and they would have fought you: therefore if they withdraw from you but fight you not, and (instead) send you (guarantees of) peace, then God hath opened no way for you (to war against them). Others you will find that wish to gain your confidence as well as that of their people: every time they are sent back to temptation, they succumb thereto; if they withdraw not from you nor give you (guarantees) of peace besides restraining their hands, seize them and slay them wherever ye get them; in their case We have provided you with a clear argument against them ({{cite quran|4|88|end=91|style=nosup}}) }}\n\n<br />\n{{quote||sign=|source=}}\n\n===Sufism===\nThe [[Sufi]]s were practitioners of the esoteric mystic traditions within an Islam at a certain point. Sufism is defined by the Sufi master or [[Pir (Sufism)]] or [[fakeer]] or [[Wali]] in the language of the people by dancing and singing and incorporating various philosophies, theologies, ideologies and religions together (e.g., Christianity, Judaism, Paganism, Platonism, Zoroastrianism, Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and so forth with time). Famous Sufi masters are [[Rumi]], [[Abul Hasan ash-Shadhili|Shadhili]], [[Sheikh Farid]], [[Bulleh Shah]], [[Shah Hussain]], [[Shams Tabrizi]], [[Waris Shah]], [[Ghazali]], [[Mian Mir]], [[Attar of Nishapur]], [[Amir Khusrow]], [[Salim Chishti]]. See many more famous Sufis at the [[List of Sufis]]. The Sufis were considered by many to have divine revelations with messages of peace, tolerance, equality, pluralism, love for all and hate for no one, humanitarians, philosophers, psychologists and much more. Many had the teaching if you want to change the world, change yourself and you will change the whole world. The views of the Sufi poets, philosophers and theologians have inspired multiple forms of modern-day academia as well as philosophers of other religions. See also [[Blind men and an elephant]]. But undoubtedly, the most influential Sufi scholar to have embraced the world is Jalaluddin Muhammad Rumi. He was born in 1207 AD in a northern province of Afghanistan, however, he later had to seek refuge in Turkey following the invasion of Afghanistan by Mongols.<ref>http://registan.net/2007/11/12/rumi-the-alchemist-of-interfaith-tolerance/</ref> Rumi, through his poetry and teachings, propagated inter-faith harmony like none other.  He served as a uniting figure for people of different faiths and his followers included Muslims, Christians and Jews. Even today, Rumi\u2019s popularity does not cease to exist within the Sufi Muslim community and his message of peace and harmony transcends religious and geographical boundaries.\n\nRumi says:\n<blockquote>\nI looked for God. I went to a temple, and I didn't find him there. Then I went to a church, and I didn't find him there. And then I went to a mosque, and I didn't find him there. And then finally I looked in my heart, and there he was. \n</blockquote>\n\nRumi also says:\n<blockquote>\nHow many paths are there to God? There are as many paths to God as there are souls on the Earth.\n</blockquote>\n\nRumi also says:\n <blockquote>\nA true Lover doesn't follow any one religion,\nbe sure of that.\nSince in the religion of Love,\nthere is no irreverence or faith.\nWhen in Love,\nbody, mind, heart and soul don't even exist.\nBecome this,\nfall in Love,\nand you will not be separated again.\n</blockquote>\n\n===Ahmadiyya===\n{{See also|Prophethood (Ahmadiyya)}}\nAhmadis recognize many founders of world religions to be from God, who all brought teaching and guidance from God to all peoples. According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the [[Quran]], every nation in the history of mankind has been sent a prophet, as the Quran states: ''And there is a guide for every people''. Though the Quran mentions only 24 prophets, the founder of Islam, [[Muhammad]] states that the world has seen 124,000 prophets. Thus other than the prophets mentioned in the Quran, Ahmadis, with support from theological study also recognize [[Buddha]], [[Krishna]], founders of [[Religion in China|Chinese religions]] to be divinely appointed individuals.\n\nThe Second [[Mirza Basheer-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad|Khalifatul Maish]] of the [[Ahmadiyya Muslim Community]] writes:\n\"According to this teaching there has not been a single people at any time in history or anywhere in the world who have not had a warner from God, a teacher, a prophet. According to the Quran there have been prophets at all times and in all countries. India, China, Russia, Afghanistan, parts of Africa, Europe, America\u2014all had prophets according to the theory of divine guidance taught by the Quran. When, therefore, Muslims hear about prophets of other peoples or other countries, they do not deny them. They do not brand them as liars. Muslims believe that other peoples have had their teachers. If other peoples have had prophets, books, and laws, these constitute no difficulty for Islam.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">\"Introduction to the Study of the Holy Qur\u2019an\" by Mirza Bashir-ud-Din Mahmood Ahmad.

(July, 2000) pp.400-7</ref> Jain doctrine states that an object has infinite modes of existence and qualities and they cannot be completely perceived in all its aspects and manifestations, due to inherent limitations of the humans.

Jains compare all attempts to proclaim absolute truth with  '' andhgajnyaya '' or the \"[[Blind men and an elephant|maxim of the blind men and elephant]]\", wherein all the blind men claimed to explain the true appearance of the elephant, but could only partly succeed due to their narrow perspective.<ref name = hughes>Hughes, Marilynn (2005) p.590-1</ref> For Jains, the problem with the blind men is not that they claim to explain the true appearance of the elephant; the problem is doing so to the exclusion of all other claims.

First and the second commandment, you shall not have another God except me, worship your God with all your heart and with all your soul. Throughout the Hebrew Bible the sovereignty of Yahweh as the only God is the key pillar of a chosen community of Israel.\n\n==Sikhism==\n{{See|Islam and Sikhism|Hinduism and Sikhism}}\nThe [[Sikh gurus]] have propagated the message of \"many paths\" leading to the [[Ek Onkar|one God]] and ultimate [[salvation]] for all souls who treading on the path of [[righteousness]]. They have supported the view that proponents of all faiths, by doing good and virtuous deeds and by remembering the [[Lord]], can certainly achieve salvation. Sikhs are told to accept all leading faiths as possible vehicles for attaining spiritual enlightenment, provided the faithful study, ponder and practice the teachings of their prophets and leaders. Sikhism had many interactions with [[Sufism]] as well as [[Hinduism]], influenced them and was influenced by them.\n\nThe [[Sri Guru Granth Sahib]], the holy book of the [[Sikh]]s, says:\n{{quote|Do not say that the Vedas, the Bible and the Koran are false.

Some serve Him as \"Gusain\", others as \"Allah\". He is the Cause of causes, and Generous. He showers His Grace and Mercy upon us. Some pilgrims bathe at sacred shrines, others go on Hajj to Mecca. Some do devotional worship, whilst others bow their heads in prayer.  Some read the Vedas, and some the Koran.  Some wear blue robes, and some wear white.  Some call themselves Muslim, and some call themselves Hindu. Some yearn for paradise, and others long for heaven. Says Nanak, one who realizes the Hukam of God's Will, knows the secrets of his Lord Master.

(Guru Granth Sahib page 12,13)\n</blockquote>\n\nThe Guru Granth Sahib also says that [[Bhagat Namdev]] and [[Kabir|Bhagat Kabir]], who were both believed to be [[Hindu]]s, both attained salvation though they were born before [[Sikhism]] took root and were clearly not Sikhs. This highlights and reinforces the Guru's saying that \"peoples of other faiths\" can join with God as true and also at the same time signify that Sikhism is not the exclusive path for liberation.\n\nAdditionally the Guru Granth Sahib says:\n<blockquote>\nFirst, Allah (God) created the Light; then, by His Creative Power, He made all mortal beings.

Those who know God and recognize His [[Shabda|Shabad]] (\"word\") lose their ego and class consciousness.

He recognised that religious labels held no value and it is the deeds of human that will be judged in the hereafter what we call ourselves religiously holds no value.\n\nSikhs have been considered eager exponents of [[interfaith dialogue]] and not only accept the right of others to practice their faith but have in the past fought and laid down their lives to protect this right for others; the [[Martyrdom of Guru Tegh Bahadar]], who on the pleas of a [[pandit]] of the [[Kashmiris]], agreed to fight against a tyrannic [[Moghul Empire]] (that was forcing them to convert to Islam) in order that they might gain the freedom to practice their religion, which differed from his own.\n\n==Religious pluralism and human service professions==\nThe concept of religious pluralism is also relevant to human service professions, such as psychology and social work, as well as medicine and nursing, in which trained professionals may interact with clients from diverse faith traditions.<ref name=p97/><ref name=zp>Brian J.

New York: Guilford. {{ISBN|978-1-57230-664-6}}</ref> has described four possible stances toward client religious and spiritual beliefs, which he called ''rejectionist'', ''exclusivist'', ''constructivist'', and ''pluralist''. Unlike the constructivist stance, the pluralist stance:\n\n<blockquote>\n...recognizes the existence of a religious or spiritual absolute reality but allows for multiple interpretations and paths toward it. In contrast to the exclusivist who maintains that there is a single path \"up the mountain of God,\" the pluralist recognizes many paths as valid. Although both the exclusivist and the pluralist may agree on the existence of religious or spiritual reality, the pluralist recognizes that this reality is expressed in different cultures and by different people in different ways. Because humans are mortal and limited, a single human religious system cannot encompass all of the religious or spiritual absolute reality.... (p. 167)<ref name=zp/>\n</blockquote>\n\nImportantly, \"the pluralistic therapist can hold personal religious beliefs while appreciating those of a client with different religious beliefs. The pluralist recognizes that religious value differences can and will exist between counselors and clients without adversely affecting therapy\" (p.&nbsp;168).<ref name=zp/> The stances implied by these four helping orientations on several key issues, such as \"should religious issues be discussed in counseling?\", have also been presented in tabular form (p.&nbsp;362, Table 12.1).<ref name=p97/>\n\nThe profession of [[chaplain]]cy, a religious profession, must also deal with issues of pluralism and the relevance of a pluralistic stance. For example, Friberg (2001) argues: \"With growing populations of immigrants and adherents of religions not previously seen in significant numbers in North America, spiritual care must take religion and diversity seriously. Utmost respect for the residents' spiritual and religious histories and orientations is imperative\" (p.&nbsp;182).<ref name=nf>Nils Friberg (2001).

''Higglytown Heroes'' had reruns on [[Disney Junior]] on its cable and satellite channel replacing [[SOAPnet]] on March 23, 2012. The Higglytown Heroes TV series was made using [[Autodesk Maya|Alias Maya]] which was used to design models and textures for the Higglytown Heroes Characters, and [[Photoshop]] which was used to create the 2D backgrounds and 2D props.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seandicken.blogspot.co.uk/p/resume.html |title=Sean Dicken \u2013 Animation Director, Animator}}</ref><br>The lyrics to the first \"Hero\" song were written by Kent Redeker, one of the show's executive producers. The song was composed and produced by Mark Harrison, the show's senior songwriter.\n\nEach episode contains two songs. An initial \"dilemma\" song which sets up the \"problem\" which needs to be solved followed by the \"hero\" song which introduces the hero who solves the problem, some of the heroes would later appear in later episodes.\n\nWhile every hero song has the same basic melody as the initial hero song written by Harrison, he performed and produced each song with different lyrics and instrumentation to fit the episode's specific hero.\n\nBrad Mossman, the other principal songwriter, composed lyrics and music for a number of dilemma songs in many episodes as well.\n\nIn 2011, [[Relient K]] re-recorded the theme song for the show for [[Disney Junior - Live on Stage!]]\nThis show was re-dubbed in the UK sometime between 2005 and 2010, which aired in the UK on Playhouse Disney on April 11, 2005. In the UK dub, Fran is voiced by veteran actress [[Sue Johnston]], Eubie is voiced by Jonathan Bee and Joe Cooper, Wayne is voiced by Africa Nile, Twinkle is voiced by Amira McCarthy, and Kip was voiced by Matthew Thomas Davies, this also included most of the character cast in the show who ware voiced by the majority of the actors in the UK. Pizza Guy is called Pizza Man instead, causing minor lip-sync issues, most of which would probably not be noticed by the show's target audience.\n\n==Series overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n\n| color1 = #072672\n| link1 = #Season 1 (2004\u201305)\n| episodes1 = 26\n| start1 = {{Start date|2004|9|13}}\n| end1 = {{End date|2005|8|8}}\n\n| color2 = #136266\n| link2 = #Season 2 (2005\u201306)\n| episodes2 = 14\n| start2 = {{Start date|2005|11|14}}\n| end2 = {{End date|2006|7|24}}\n\n| color3 = #FB6900\n| link3 = #Season 3 (2006\u201308)\n| episodes3 = 25\n| start3 = {{Start date|2006|9|2}}\n| end3 = {{End date|2008|1|7}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n==Episodes==\n===Season 1 (2004\u201305)===\n{{Episode table\n| background=#072672\n| overall=\n| season=1\n| title=\n| titleR=\n|director=\n| writer=\n| aux2=\n| aux2T=Storyboard by\n| airdate={{Void}}\n| airdateR=\n| prodcode=TBA\n| country=US\n| episodes=\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=1\n| EpisodeNumber2=1\n| Title=Up A Tree\"<hr>\"Missing Grandpop (aka \"Missing Grandad\")\n| DirectedBy=George Evelyn and Denis Morella\n| WrittenBy=Holly Huckins & Kent Redeker<hr>Kent Redeker\n| Aux2=Leah Waldron<hr>George Evelyn\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|9|13}}\n| ProdCode=101\n| ShortSummary=\n| LineColor=E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=2\n| EpisodeNumber2=2\n| Title=Twinkle Tooth\"/\"Flower Power\n| DirectedBy=George Evelyn and Denis Morella\n| WrittenBy=\n| Aux2=\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|9|20}}\n| ProdCode=102\n| ShortSummary=\n| LineColor= E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=3\n| EpisodeNumber2=3\n| Title=Smells Like a Mystery\"/\"Ship Ahoy!\n| DirectedBy=George Evelyn and Denis Morella\n| WrittenBy=\n| Aux2=\n| RTitle= \n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|10|11}}\n| ProdCode=103\n| ShortSummary=\n| LineColor= E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=4\n| EpisodeNumber2=4\n| Title=Halloween Heroes\" (aka \"Higgly Halloween\")\n| DirectedBy=George Evelyn and Denis Morella\n| WrittenBy=Kent Redeker\n| Aux2=[[William Reiss]]\n| RTitle= \n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|10|25}}\n| ProdCode=104\n| ShortSummary=\n| LineColor= E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=5\n| EpisodeNumber2=5\n| Title=Soup With Stars\"/\"The Happy Friendly Sparkly Toast Club\n| DirectedBy=George Evelyn and Denis Morella\n| WrittenBy=\n| Aux2=\n| RTitle= \n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|11|1}}\n| ProdCode=105\n| ShortSummary=The kids try to find stars for soup with stars tonight.<hr />Inspired by their friends' club, the kids scramble to make their own.\n| LineColor= E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=6\n| EpisodeNumber2=6\n| Title=Catch Up With Ketchup\"/\"Star Struck\n| DirectedBy=George Evelyn and Denis Morella\n| WrittenBy=\n| Aux2=\n| RTitle= \n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|11|8}}\n| ProdCode=106\n| ShortSummary=The kids must bring ketchup to Kid's dad's hot dog stand.<hr />Wayne breaks his glasses during a shooting star watch.\n| LineColor= E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=7\n| EpisodeNumber2=7\n| Title=First Snow\"/\"Snow Dazed\n| RTitle=\n| DirectedBy=\n| WrittenBy=\n| Aux2=\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|11|15}}\n| ProdCode=107\n| ShortSummary=\n| LineColor=E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=8\n| EpisodeNumber2=8\n| Title=Flappy's Not Happy\"/\"Electric Evening\n| DirectedBy=\n| WrittenBy=\n| Aux2=\n| RTitle=\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|11|22}}\n| ProdCode=108\n| ShortSummary=\n| LineColor=E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=9\n| EpisodeNumber2=9\n| Title=All Tire'd Out\"/\"Great Un-Expectations\n| DirectedBy=\n| WrittenBy=\n| Aux2=\n| RTitle=\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|12|6}}\n| ProdCode=109\n| ShortSummary=\n| LineColor=E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=10\n| EpisodeNumber2=10\n| Title=Twinkle's Wish\n| DirectedBy=George Evelyn and Denis Morella\n| WrittenBy=\n| Aux2=\n| RTitle=\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|12|13}}\n| ProdCode=110\n| ShortSummary=\n| LineColor=E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=11\n| EpisodeNumber2=11\n| Title=Smooth Operator\"<hr />\"Stinky Situation\n| DirectedBy=George Evelyn and Denis Morella\n| WrittenBy=Peter Gaffney<hr />Holly Huckins\n| Aux2=Kinjo Estioko<hr />William Reiss\n| RTitle=\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|12|13}}\n| ProdCode=111\n| ShortSummary=\n| LineColor=E698D0\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber=12\n| EpisodeNumber2=12\n| Title=Weather or Not\"<hr />\"Green in the Gills\n| DirectedBy=George Evelyn and Denis Morella\n| WrittenBy=Chris Nee<hr />Steve Viksten\n| Aux2=Romy Garcia<hr />Leah Waldron\n| RTitle=\n| OriginalAirDate={{Start Date|2004|12|20}}\n| ProdCode=112\n| ShortSummary=When the weather doesn't cooperate while the kids paint a barrel, they need help...and fast!<hr />When Kid's mom gets sick, the kids paint a picture on their get-well card.

The show's characters are shaped like [[Matryoshka doll|Russian nesting dolls]]. In the show, children Wayne, Eubie, Twinkle and Kip learn about all of the important jobs that people do in Higglytown.<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |pages=282-284}}</ref>\n\nThe theme song of the show, ''Here in Higglytown'', is performed by [[They Might Be Giants]], which was also released on their second children's album ''[[Here Come the ABCs]]''. ''Higglytown Heroes'' had reruns on [[Disney Junior]] on its cable and satellite channel replacing [[SOAPnet]] on March 23, 2012. The Higglytown Heroes TV series was made using [[Autodesk Maya|Alias Maya]] which was used to design models and textures for the Higglytown Heroes Characters, and [[Photoshop]] which was used to create the 2D backgrounds and 2D props.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://seandicken.blogspot.co.uk/p/resume.html |title=Sean Dicken \u2013 Animation Director, Animator}}</ref><br>The lyrics to the first \"Hero\" song were written by Kent Redeker, one of the show's executive producers. The song was composed and produced by Mark Harrison, the show's senior songwriter.\n\nEach episode contains two songs. An initial \"dilemma\" song which sets up the \"problem\" which needs to be solved followed by the \"hero\" song which introduces the hero who solves the problem, some of the heroes would later appear in later episodes.\n\nWhile every hero song has the same basic melody as the initial hero song written by Harrison, he performed and produced each song with different lyrics and instrumentation to fit the episode's specific hero.\n\nBrad Mossman, the other principal songwriter, composed lyrics and music for a number of dilemma songs in many episodes as well.\n\nIn 2011, [[Relient K]] re-recorded the theme song for the show for [[Disney Junior - Live on Stage!]]\nThis show was re-dubbed in the UK sometime between 2005 and 2010, which aired in the UK on Playhouse Disney on April 11, 2005. In the UK dub, Fran is voiced by veteran actress [[Sue Johnston]], Eubie is voiced by Jonathan Bee and Joe Cooper, Wayne is voiced by Africa Nile, Twinkle is voiced by Amira McCarthy, and Kip was voiced by Matthew Thomas Davies, this also included most of the character cast in the show who ware voiced by the majority of the actors in the UK. Pizza Guy is called Pizza Man instead, causing minor lip-sync issues, most of which would probably not be noticed by the show's target audience.\n\n==Series overview==\n<onlyinclude>{{Series

[[Ramree Island]] ([[Yangbye]] Kywan) lies off the [[Burma]] coast, {{convert|70|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of Akyab (now [[Sittwe]]). The island had been captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in early 1942, along with the rest of Southern Burma. In January 1945, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] launched an attack to retake Ramree and its neighbour [[Cheduba|Cheduba Island]], to establish airbases on the islands for the supply of the mainland campaign. There have been reports of Japanese soldiers being eaten by [[saltwater crocodile]]s living in the inland [[mangrove swamps]]; the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] has listed it as \"worst crocodile disaster in the world\" and \"most number of fatalities in a [[crocodile attack]]\" but scientists and historians have dismissed this as implausible.{{sfn|Russell|1987|p=216}}{{sfn|Kynaston|1998|p=135}}\n\n==Background==\nThe early capture of [[Sittwe|Akyab]] made the [[26th Indian Infantry Division]] (Major-General [[Henry Chambers (Indian Army officer)|Henry Chambers]]) available for an attack on Ramree Island, {{convert|70|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the south, the island being {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|20|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide, flat and an obvious site for airfields.{{sfn|Saunders|1975|p=350}} A plan was ready by 2 January, when it was clear that the advance of the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] (Lieutenant-General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]]) would soon pass beyond the range of its airbases at [[Imphal]] and [[Agartala]]; replacements at [[Chittagong]], Akyab and Ramree would be needed.{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=433}} On 14 January, the 26th Indian Division was ordered to attack Ramree on 21 January, as a Royal Marine detachment from [[3 Commando Brigade]] occupied Cheduba Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|pp=214\u2013215}} The Japanese garrison of Ramree consisted of the II Battalion, 121st Infantry Regiment (Colonel Kanichi Nagazawa), part of the [[54th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|54th Division]], with artillery and engineer detachments to act as an independent force.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=215}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\nThe battle started with [[Operation Matador (1945)|Operation Matador]], an amphibious assault to capture the strategic port of [[Kyaukpyu]] at the north end of Ramree Island and the airfield near the port, south of [[Akyab]] across Hunter's Bay. The invasion force was led by three Joint Assault Commanders, Captain Bush RN, Major-General [[Cyril Lomax]] and Wing Commander H. Smith. Reconnaissance carried out on 14 January 1945, found that Japanese forces were placing artillery in caves overlooking the landing beaches on Ramree and the [[Royal Navy]] assigned the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}}, the [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]] {{HMS|Ameer|D01|6}}, [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Phoebe|43|6}}, the destroyers ''Rapid'', ''Napier'', ''Norman'' and ''Pathfinder'', with the [[Black Swan-class sloop|sloops]] ''Flamingo'' and RIN ''Kistna'', to provide more firepower in support of the task force. On 21 January, an hour before the [[71st Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier R. C. Cotterell-Hill) was to land, ''Queen Elizabeth'' opened fire with {{nowrap|69 rounds}} of {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}}-shell from the main battery, while aircraft from ''Ameer'' spotted the fall of shot. ''Phoebe'' also joined the bombardment, along with Consolidated [[B-24 Liberator]]s, North American [[B-25 Mitchell]]s and Republic [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s of [[No. 224 Group RAF|224 Group]] [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), under the command of [[RAF Third Tactical Air Force|HQ RAF Bengal and Burma]], that strafed and bombed the beaches.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Indian Div beside temple on Ramree Island.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Men of the Wiltshire Regiment from the 26th Indian Infantry Division prepare a meal beside a temple on Ramree Island.}}]]\nThe assault troops were slightly delayed when a motor launch and a landing craft struck mines but landed unopposed on the beaches west of Kyaukpyu at {{nowrap|9:42 a.m.,}} securing the beachhead by the afternoon. The following day, the [[4th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier J. F. R. Forman) landed, took over the beachhead and occupied Kyaukpyu and on 23 January, the 71st Infantry Brigade advanced southwards, down the west coast. Two days later Mayin was occupied and the troops reached the Yanbauk Chaung the next day. Resistance at the chaung from the troops of the II Battalion, 121st Regiment increased and on 31 January, the 71st Brigade was ordered to move inland, north-east towards Sane, then head south towards Ramree town. The 4th Brigade was to keep the defenders at Yanbauk Chaung under pressure and follow up vigorously should they retire.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}}\n\n(On 26 January in [[Operation Sankey]], a [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] force landed on [[Cheduba]] island, about {{convert|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the south-west coast of Ramree Island and found it unoccupied.) On Ramree, the Japanese garrison put up tenacious resistance but on 1 February, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade reached Sane and parts of the [[36th Indian Infantry Brigade]], from reserve, took Sagu Kuyun Island and relieved the marines on Cheduba Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}} When the British outflanked a Japanese stronghold, the {{nowrap|900 defenders}} abandoned the base and marched to join a larger battalion of Japanese soldiers across the island. The route took the Japanese through {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[mangrove]] swamp and as they struggled through it, the British encircled the area. Trapped in deep mud-filled land, tropical diseases soon started to afflict the soldiers, as did [[scorpion]]s, tropical [[mosquito]]es and [[saltwater crocodile]]s.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}}\n\nOn 7 February, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade and supporting tanks reached the town of Ramree and found determined Japanese resistance. The 4th Indian Infantry Brigade had advanced to Ledaung Chaung and was sent east to reinforce the attack; the town fell on 9 February. The navy and the 26th Indian Infantry Division then concentrated on blockading the ''chaungs'' (small streams) on the east coast to prevent the Japanese from escaping to the mainland. A Japanese air raid on 11 February seriously damaged a destroyer with a near miss and forty small craft were sent by the Japanese from the mainland to rescue the survivors of the garrison. Japanese resistance on the island ended on 17 February and the Allied blockade was maintained until 22 February, sinking many of the rescue craft and inflicting many casualties on the Japanese troops hiding in the mangrove swamps; about {{nowrap|500 troops}} managed to get away. Cheduba Island was not garrisoned and the 22nd East African Brigade was sent to hold Ramree Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\nIn 1965, the British official historian [[Stanley Kirby|Stanley Woodburn Kirby]] wrote that the Japanese defence of the island and the escape of about {{nowrap|500 men}} against \"fearful odds\", had been courageous and determined.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}} It took until 16 April for the airfield to be used for transport sorties, Akyab having come into use on 1 April. It had been vital to complete the occupation of Ramree Island quickly, as [[Operation Dracula]] against Rangoon needed to commence in the first week of May at the latest, to have a chance of finishing before the monsoon.{{sfn|Saunders|1975|p=350}} The experience in co-operation between the 26th Indian Division and the navy in the war of chaungs and small ports along the Arakan coast was intended to be exploited in the attack. An estimate put naval gunfire support from 4 January to 13 March for the land operations at Akyab, Ramree and Cheduba at {{nowrap|23,000 shells.}} The navy also carried {{nowrap|54,000 men,}} {{nowrap|1,000 vehicles,}} {{convert|14000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of stores and {{nowrap|800 animals.}}{{sfn|Allen|1984|p=468}}\n\n===Crocodile attack===\n[[File:SaltwaterCrocodile('Maximo').jpg|thumb|{{centre|A [[saltwater crocodile]]}}]]\nSome British soldiers, including the naturalist [[Bruce Stanley Wright]], who participated in the battle, claimed that the large population of saltwater crocodiles native to the mangrove swamps on Ramree Island [[predation|preyed on]] the trapped Japanese force at night and ate many soldiers. Wright gave a description in ''Wildlife Sketches Near and Far'' (1962), quoted by [[Frank McLynn]],\n\n{{quote|That night [of the 19 February 1945] was the most horrible that any member of the M. L. [motor launch] crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left.... Of about one thousand Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about twenty were found alive.|Wright{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=13}}}}\n\nIf Wright was correct, the Ramree Island [[crocodile attacks]] were the worst recorded in history. The British [[Burma Star Association]] seems to lend credence to the swamp attack stories but appears to draw a distinction between the {{nowrap|20 Japanese}} survivors of one attack and the {{nowrap|900 Japanese}} who were left to fend for themselves in the swamp. There is no corroboration of the event by contemporary British military reports or from Japanese soldiers and local Burmese civilians. Wright is the only source for a mass crocodile attack and his figures have been disputed by other historians, who call the event an [[urban myth]].{{sfn|Platt|Ko|Khaing|Rainwater|2001|pp=15\u201318}} McLynn wrote\n\n{{quote|Most of all, there is a single zoological problem. If 'thousands of crocodiles' were involved in the massacre, as in the urban (jungle) myth, how had these ravening monsters survived before and how were they to survive later? The ecosystem of a mangrove swamp, with an exiguous mammal life, simply would not have permitted the existence of so many saurians before the coming of the Japanese (animals are not exempt from the laws of overpopulation and starvation).{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=14}}}}\n\nThe British official history (War against Japan volume IV, ''The Reconquest of Burma'', 1965 [2004]) referred only to \"crocodile-infested mangrove swamps\".{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Allen|1984}}\n|last=Allen |first=Louis |title=Burma: The Longest War |publisher=Dent Paperbacks |location=London |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-460-02474-7}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Kynaston|1998}}\n|title=The Guinness 1999 Book of Records |editor1-first=Nick |editor1-last=Kynaston |publisher=Guinness Publishing |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-85112-070-6}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|McLynn|2011}}\n|first=Frank |last=McLynn |title=The Burma Campaign: Disaster into Triumph, 1942\u201345 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-300-17162-4}}\n* {{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Platt|Ko|Khaing|Rainwater|2001}}\n|last1=Platt |first1=S.

[[Ramree Island]] ([[Yangbye]] Kywan) lies off the [[Burma]] coast, {{convert|70|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} south of Akyab (now [[Sittwe]]). The island had been captured by the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] in early 1942, along with the rest of Southern Burma. In January 1945, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] launched an attack to retake Ramree and its neighbour [[Cheduba|Cheduba Island]], to establish airbases on the islands for the supply of the mainland campaign. There have been reports of Japanese soldiers being eaten by [[saltwater crocodile]]s living in the inland [[mangrove swamps]]; the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] has listed it as \"worst crocodile disaster in the world\" and \"most number of fatalities in a [[crocodile attack]]\" but scientists and historians have dismissed this as implausible.{{sfn|Russell|1987|p=216}}{{sfn|Kynaston|1998|p=135}}\n\n==Background==\nThe early capture of [[Sittwe|Akyab]] made the [[26th Indian Infantry Division]] (Major-General [[Henry Chambers (Indian Army officer)|Henry Chambers]]) available for an attack on Ramree Island, {{convert|70|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} to the south, the island being {{convert|50|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|20|mi|km|order=flip|abbr=on}} wide, flat and an obvious site for airfields.{{sfn|Saunders|1975|p=350}} A plan was ready by 2 January, when it was clear that the advance of the [[Fourteenth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourteenth Army]] (Lieutenant-General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]]) would soon pass beyond the range of its airbases at [[Imphal]] and [[Agartala]]; replacements at [[Chittagong]], Akyab and Ramree would be needed.{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=433}} On 14 January, the 26th Indian Division was ordered to attack Ramree on 21 January, as a Royal Marine detachment from [[3 Commando Brigade]] occupied Cheduba Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|pp=214\u2013215}} The Japanese garrison of Ramree consisted of the II Battalion, 121st Infantry Regiment (Colonel Kanichi Nagazawa), part of the [[54th Division (Imperial Japanese Army)|54th Division]], with artillery and engineer detachments to act as an independent force.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=215}}\n\n==Prelude==\n\nThe battle started with [[Operation Matador (1945)|Operation Matador]], an amphibious assault to capture the strategic port of [[Kyaukpyu]] at the north end of Ramree Island and the airfield near the port, south of [[Akyab]] across Hunter's Bay. The invasion force was led by three Joint Assault Commanders, Captain Bush RN, Major-General [[Cyril Lomax]] and Wing Commander H. Smith. Reconnaissance carried out on 14 January 1945, found that Japanese forces were placing artillery in caves overlooking the landing beaches on Ramree and the [[Royal Navy]] assigned the [[battleship]] {{HMS|Queen Elizabeth|1913|6}}, the [[escort aircraft carrier|escort carrier]] {{HMS|Ameer|D01|6}}, [[light cruiser]] {{HMS|Phoebe|43|6}}, the destroyers ''Rapid'', ''Napier'', ''Norman'' and ''Pathfinder'', with the [[Black Swan-class sloop|sloops]] ''Flamingo'' and RIN ''Kistna'', to provide more firepower in support of the task force. On 21 January, an hour before the [[71st Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier R. C. Cotterell-Hill) was to land, ''Queen Elizabeth'' opened fire with {{nowrap|69 rounds}} of {{convert|15|in|mm|adj=on}}-shell from the main battery, while aircraft from ''Ameer'' spotted the fall of shot. ''Phoebe'' also joined the bombardment, along with Consolidated [[B-24 Liberator]]s, North American [[B-25 Mitchell]]s and Republic [[P-47 Thunderbolt]]s of [[No. 224 Group RAF|224 Group]] [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF), under the command of [[RAF Third Tactical Air Force|HQ RAF Bengal and Burma]], that strafed and bombed the beaches.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}}\n\n==Battle==\n[[File:Indian Div beside temple on Ramree Island.jpg|thumb|{{centre|Men of the Wiltshire Regiment from the 26th Indian Infantry Division prepare a meal beside a temple on Ramree Island.}}]]\nThe assault troops were slightly delayed when a motor launch and a landing craft struck mines but landed unopposed on the beaches west of Kyaukpyu at {{nowrap|9:42 a.m.,}} securing the beachhead by the afternoon. The following day, the [[4th Indian Infantry Brigade]] (Brigadier J. F. R. Forman) landed, took over the beachhead and occupied Kyaukpyu and on 23 January, the 71st Infantry Brigade advanced southwards, down the west coast. Two days later Mayin was occupied and the troops reached the Yanbauk Chaung the next day. Resistance at the chaung from the troops of the II Battalion, 121st Regiment increased and on 31 January, the 71st Brigade was ordered to move inland, north-east towards Sane, then head south towards Ramree town. The 4th Brigade was to keep the defenders at Yanbauk Chaung under pressure and follow up vigorously should they retire.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}}\n\n(On 26 January in [[Operation Sankey]], a [[Royal Marines|Royal Marine]] force landed on [[Cheduba]] island, about {{convert|10|km|mi|order=flip|abbr=on}} from the south-west coast of Ramree Island and found it unoccupied.) On Ramree, the Japanese garrison put up tenacious resistance but on 1 February, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade reached Sane and parts of the [[36th Indian Infantry Brigade]], from reserve, took Sagu Kuyun Island and relieved the marines on Cheduba Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=219}} When the British outflanked a Japanese stronghold, the {{nowrap|900 defenders}} abandoned the base and marched to join a larger battalion of Japanese soldiers across the island. The route took the Japanese through {{convert|16|km|mi|abbr=on}} of [[mangrove]] swamp and as they struggled through it, the British encircled the area. Trapped in deep mud-filled land, tropical diseases soon started to afflict the soldiers, as did [[scorpion]]s, tropical [[mosquito]]es and [[saltwater crocodile]]s.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}}\n\nOn 7 February, the 71st Indian Infantry Brigade and supporting tanks reached the town of Ramree and found determined Japanese resistance. The 4th Indian Infantry Brigade had advanced to Ledaung Chaung and was sent east to reinforce the attack; the town fell on 9 February. The navy and the 26th Indian Infantry Division then concentrated on blockading the ''chaungs'' (small streams) on the east coast to prevent the Japanese from escaping to the mainland. A Japanese air raid on 11 February seriously damaged a destroyer with a near miss and forty small craft were sent by the Japanese from the mainland to rescue the survivors of the garrison. Japanese resistance on the island ended on 17 February and the Allied blockade was maintained until 22 February, sinking many of the rescue craft and inflicting many casualties on the Japanese troops hiding in the mangrove swamps; about {{nowrap|500 troops}} managed to get away. Cheduba Island was not garrisoned and the 22nd East African Brigade was sent to hold Ramree Island.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|pp=219\u2013220}}\n\n==Aftermath==\n\n===Analysis===\nIn 1965, the British official historian [[Stanley Kirby|Stanley Woodburn Kirby]] wrote that the Japanese defence of the island and the escape of about {{nowrap|500 men}} against \"fearful odds\", had been courageous and determined.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}} It took until 16 April for the airfield to be used for transport sorties, Akyab having come into use on 1 April. It had been vital to complete the occupation of Ramree Island quickly, as [[Operation Dracula]] against Rangoon needed to commence in the first week of May at the latest, to have a chance of finishing before the monsoon.{{sfn|Saunders|1975|p=350}} The experience in co-operation between the 26th Indian Division and the navy in the war of chaungs and small ports along the Arakan coast was intended to be exploited in the attack. An estimate put naval gunfire support from 4 January to 13 March for the land operations at Akyab, Ramree and Cheduba at {{nowrap|23,000 shells.}} The navy also carried {{nowrap|54,000 men,}} {{nowrap|1,000 vehicles,}} {{convert|14000|LT|t|abbr=on}} of stores and {{nowrap|800 animals.}}{{sfn|Allen|1984|p=468}}\n\n===Crocodile attack===\n[[File:SaltwaterCrocodile('Maximo').jpg|thumb|{{centre|A [[saltwater crocodile]]}}]]\nSome British soldiers, including the naturalist [[Bruce Stanley Wright]], who participated in the battle, claimed that the large population of saltwater crocodiles native to the mangrove swamps on Ramree Island [[predation|preyed on]] the trapped Japanese force at night and ate many soldiers. Wright gave a description in ''Wildlife Sketches Near and Far'' (1962), quoted by [[Frank McLynn]],\n\n{{quote|That night [of the 19 February 1945] was the most horrible that any member of the M. L. [motor launch] crews ever experienced. The scattered rifle shots in the pitch black swamp punctured by the screams of wounded men crushed in the jaws of huge reptiles, and the blurred worrying sound of spinning crocodiles made a cacophony of hell that has rarely been duplicated on earth. At dawn the vultures arrived to clean up what the crocodiles had left.... Of about one thousand Japanese soldiers that entered the swamps of Ramree, only about twenty were found alive.|Wright{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=13}}}}\n\nIf Wright was correct, the Ramree Island [[crocodile attacks]] were the worst recorded in history. The British [[Burma Star Association]] seems to lend credence to the swamp attack stories but appears to draw a distinction between the {{nowrap|20 Japanese}} survivors of one attack and the {{nowrap|900 Japanese}} who were left to fend for themselves in the swamp. There is no corroboration of the event by contemporary British military reports or from Japanese soldiers and local Burmese civilians. Wright is the only source for a mass crocodile attack and his figures have been disputed by other historians, who call the event an [[urban myth]].{{sfn|Platt|Ko|Khaing|Rainwater|2001|pp=15\u201318}} McLynn wrote\n\n{{quote|Most of all, there is a single zoological problem. If 'thousands of crocodiles' were involved in the massacre, as in the urban (jungle) myth, how had these ravening monsters survived before and how were they to survive later? The ecosystem of a mangrove swamp, with an exiguous mammal life, simply would not have permitted the existence of so many saurians before the coming of the Japanese (animals are not exempt from the laws of overpopulation and starvation).{{sfn|McLynn|2011|p=14}}}}\n\nThe British official history (War against Japan volume IV, ''The Reconquest of Burma'', 1965 [2004]) referred only to \"crocodile-infested mangrove swamps\".{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004|p=220}}\n\n==Footnotes==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Allen|1984}}\n|last=Allen |first=Louis |title=Burma: The Longest War |publisher=Dent Paperbacks |location=London |year=1984 |isbn=978-0-460-02474-7}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|Kynaston|1998}}\n|title=The Guinness 1999 Book of Records |editor1-first=Nick |editor1-last=Kynaston |publisher=Guinness Publishing |year=1998 |isbn=978-0-85112-070-6}}\n* {{cite book |ref={{harvid|McLynn|2011}}\n|first=Frank |last=McLynn |title=The Burma Campaign: Disaster into Triumph, 1942\u201345 |publisher=Yale University Press |location= |year=2011 |isbn=978-0-300-17162-4}}\n* {{cite journal |ref={{harvid|Platt|Ko|Khaing|Rainwater|2001}}\n|last1=Platt |first1=S.

{"title_page": "Professional wrestling aerial techniques", "text_new": "{{short description|none}}\n'''Aerial techniques''', also known as \"High-flying moves\" are maneuvers in [[professional wrestling]] using the ring's posts and ropes as aids, in many cases to demonstrate the speed and agility of smaller, nimble and acrobatically inclined wrestlers preferring this style instead of [[Professional wrestling throws|throwing]] or [[Professional wrestling holds|locking]] the opponent. Due to injuries caused by these high risk moves, some promotions have banned the use of some of them. The next list of maneuvers was made under general categories whenever possible.\n\n==Attacks==\n\n===Diving chops===\n\n[[File:Undertaker oldschool 2.jpg|right|thumb|[[The Undertaker]] jumping down from the top rope to strike [[Jon Heidenreich|Heidenreich]] with ''Old School'']]\n\n====Arm twist ropewalk chop====\nThe wrestler takes hold of one of the opponent's wrists, twisting the arm into an [[Professional wrestling holds#Arm wrench|arm wrench]]. The wrestler then climbs up the corner turnbuckles and [[#Ropewalk|takes a walk on the top rope]] before falling down striking the opponent's head, back, shoulder or nape with a chop. This is more known as ''Old School'', the name used by [[The Undertaker]], who popularized it.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-10|title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-05-04|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\n====Diving overhead chop====\nStanding on the top turnbuckle, the attacking wrestler proceeds to jump in order to deliver an [[Professional wrestling attacks#Overhead chop|overhead chop]] to a standing opponent's head. This is one of the most recognizable signature moves performed by [[Tatanka (wrestler)|Tatanka]], who called it the ''Tomahawk Chop''.\n\n[[Image:Ouch!.jpg|left|thumb| [[Kane (wrestler)|Kane]] performing a flying clothesline on [[CM Punk]]]]\n\n===Diving clothesline===\nThe attacking wrestler jumps from an elevated position as extending their arm out from the side of the body and parallel to the ground, hitting the standing opponent in the neck or chest, knocking them over. A version of this move, called a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Lariat|flying lariat]], involving the wrestler wrapping the attacking arm around the opponent's neck.\n\n===Diving double axe handle===\nAlso known as diving axe handle, diving double axe handle smash or diving double sledge, this is accomplished by jumping from the top turnbuckle to the mat or floor and striking the opponent with two fists held together in the fashion of holding an axe. This is usually done on a standing or rising opponent. A common variation sees the wrestler standing over the top rope, facing away from the ring. From this point, the wrestler jumps twisting his body (now facing inside of the ring) quickly holding clutching both fists together to strike the double axe handle.\n\n===Diving drops===\n\n====Diving elbow drop====\n[[File:Mark Briscoe flying elbow.jpg|right|thumb|[[Mark Briscoe]] performing a diving elbow drop on [[Colin Delaney]]]]\nExecuted by diving onto a supine opponent with one elbow cocked, driving the elbow into the opponent as the wrestler falls on one of their sides.\n\n=====Diving back elbow drop=====\nThis less common variation sees a wrestler stand facing away from a standing or supine opponent and in an elevated position (usually the top turnbuckle). The wrestler then dives backwards to strike the opponent. It was popularized by the late great [[Randy Savage]], and is used by various wrestlers such as [[Jay Lethal]], [[CM Punk]], [[Bayley (wrestler)|Bayley]] and [[Velveteen Dream]].\n\n=====Diving pointed elbow drop=====\nThe wrestler sits on the top turnbuckle with a foot on each second rope facing a supine opponent. The wrestler then leaps towards clasping both forearms together, landing on their knees, driving an elbow into the opponent.\n\n=====Shooting star elbow drop=====\nThis move sees a wrestler jumping forward from an elevated position followed by executing a [[#Shooting star|mid-air backflip]] to land elbow first on an opponent lying on the mat.\n\n====Diving fist drop====\nA move in which a wrestler jumps down from the turnbuckle on an opponent driving his fist into the opponent's head. While doing it, wrestlers have their front four knuckles out, and their thumb to the side. This move was popularised by [[Jerry Lawler]] as his finisher.<ref name=\"deathvalleydriver.com\">{{cite web|url= http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part1.htm|archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130506000024/http://www.deathvalleydriver.com/bbbowm/part1.htm|url-status= dead|archive-date= 2013-05-06|title=\"Professional Wrestling Moves: Part 1\" |id= Last Updated : 7/12/01}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:BenoitHbWm23.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[Chris Benoit]] performing a diving headbutt on [[Montel Vontavious Porter|MVP]] at [[WrestleMania 23]]]]\n\n====Diving headbutt====\nAlso known as a diving [[Professional wrestling attacks#Headbutt drop|headbutt drop]], it is delivered from the turnbuckle to anywhere on the opponent's body.<ref name=rob>{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/comments/zidane-heads-a-list-that-dates-back-to-the-dinosaur/2006/07/11/1152383741579.html|title=Zidane heads a list that dates back to the dinosaur|author=Hiaasen, Rob|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2009-03-12|date=July 12, 2006}}</ref> The move was accidentally innovated by [[Harley Race]],<ref name=rob/> who adapted it as a signature move and it was then further popularized by [[Dynamite Kid|The Dynamite Kid]], [[Chris Benoit]], [[Daniel Bryan]] and [[Lars Sullivan]].<ref name=\"DivingHeadbutt\">{{cite web |url=http://www.puroresufan.com/roster/tenzan.php |title=Hiroyoshi Tenzan|publisher=Strong Style Spirit |accessdate=May 19, 2007 |year=2007 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20070418133801/http://www.puroresufan.com/roster/tenzan.php|archivedate=April 18, 2007|url-status=dead }}</ref> It was later discovered that this move could cause severe spinal,<ref name=rob/> brain, legs, or chest damage.

There is also a variation where a wrestler jumps from the elevated position and lands both knees across the prone opponent, referred to as a ''diving double knee drop''.\n\n=====Meteora=====\nThis version of the diving double knee drop sees the attacker performing the maneuver from an elevated platform, jumping forward onto a standing or seated upright opponent with each knee striking both of their shoulders simultaneously. [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Springboard|Springboard]], [[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Slingshot|slingshot]], and standing or running versions of this move are also possible with the latter being used while the attacker is charging towards an opponent, against a charging opponent, or a combination of both. Innovated by [[CIMA (wrestler)|CIMA]], who has used both a springboard and top rope version as finishing maneuvers in [[Dragon Gate (wrestling)|Dragon Gate]], and named it after the [[Meteora|Greek landmark]] where he proposed to his wife. [[Sasha Banks]] is also known to use the meteora in [[WWE]] as a transitional move, being a Dragon Gate fan.\n\n=====Shooting star knee drop=====\nThis move sees the wrestler jumping forward from the second turnbuckle executing a mid-air backflip, landing knee first on an  opponent down all on fours.  It is a finishing move used by \"Speedball\" Mike Bailey.\n\n====Diving leg drop====\nAlso called ''guillotine leg drop'', this move sees a wrestler jumping from a raised platform landing the bottom side of one leg across the opponent's throat or chest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwa4.com/Wrestling_Move_Leg_Drop_From_Ropes.html|title=Wrestling moves: leg drop from ropes|publisher=WWA4 Wrestling School|accessdate=2009-03-23|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090303004111/http://wwa4.com/Wrestling_Move_Leg_Drop_From_Ropes.html|archivedate=2009-03-03}}</ref>\n\n=====Diving leg drop bulldog=====\nAlso known as ''diving Famouser'', sees the wrestler [[#Springboard|springboarding]] off one of the ropes or jumping from the top turnbuckle [[Leg drop#Leg drop bulldog|dropping a leg across the nape of a leaning forward opponent]].\n\n=====Moonsault leg drop=====\nThis variation sees the wrestler performing a [[#Moonsault|moonsault]] but instead of landing on the opponent in a [[#Diving splash|splash]] position, the wrestler continues the rotation to drive a leg across the downed opponent.\n\n=====Shooting star leg drop=====\nThe wrestler jumps forward from an elevated position following a [[#Shooting star|full 360\u00b0 or beyond]] rotation, driving a leg across the fallen opponent.\n\n=====Somersault leg drop=====\nThe wrestler, standing on an elevated position, jumps and flips forward to land one leg on the opponent lying beneath. This move can also be performed from a standing non-elevated position although this variation is quite rare.\n\n===Diving senton===\nThis diving variation for a [[Professional wrestling attacks#Senton|senton]] sees the wrestler landing back or buttocks first on the opponent's stomach or chest.<ref name=wwemag>{{citation|title=WWE Magazine (p.91)|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|date=July 2007}}</ref>\n\n====630\u00b0 senton====\nThe attacker on the top turnbuckle jumps and flips mid-air into a [[Somersault#Types|double front somersault]] to land sitting on the opponent below.\n\n=====Corkscrew 630\u00b0 senton=====\nIn this version, the wrestler facing away from the ring on the top turnbuckle performs a [[#Corkscrew|180\u00b0 mid-air turn]] while executing the maneuver.\n\n====Diving seated senton====\n[[File:Razor Ramon HG Senton.jpg|thumb|left|[[Razor Ramon HG]] performing a seated senton]]\nThis variant has the wrestler using the tailbone and lower back to fall in a seated position forcing a standing opponent to the mat rather than using their whole back. Performed by jumping forward off a raised platform or springboarding on to the opponent's shoulders, forcing them to the ground. This can also be performed onto an opponent prone or supine on the mat. A variation of this move known as the ''Banzai Drop'', popularized by [[Yokozuna (wrestler)|Yokozuna]], sees the wrestler standing over a fallen opponent next to the turnbuckle, then climbing up to the second rope and jumping down, landing on the opponent's stomach or chest. \n\n[[File:Kelly Kelly Molly go round.jpg|right|thumb|175px|[[Kelly Kelly]] performing the Molly-go-round at [[WrestleMania XXVIII]]]]\n\n=====Molly-Go-Round=====\nThis variant, which is technically described as a diving somersault seated senton is performed by flipping forward off a raised platform on to the shoulders of a standing opponent, forcing them to the ground into a pinning position.

Then approaching to the turnbuckle in the same corner, grabbing a hold both hands on the top rope and climbing to the first or second rope, the wrestler bounces on the ropes before throwing both legs backwards and placing the body parallel to the mat as releasing the ropes, thus falling inwards and downwards to the ring squashing and pinning the opponent.

Instead, the attacker turns mid-air to land on the opponent in the splash position, regardless of which direction the opponent is lying in. It was made famous by [[Extreme Championship Wrestling|ECW]], [[WWF/E]] and [[Total Nonstop Action Wrestling|TNA]] superstar [[Rob Van Dam]] as it was used as his finisher. He also uses a regular version, generally going halfway or more than halfway across the ring to hit his opponent.\n\n[[Image:Divingdoublestomp.jpg|left|thumb|175px|[[Matt Hyson|Spike Dudley]] hitting a diving double foot stomp on [[Rodney Begnaud|Rodney Mack]]]]\n\n===Diving stomp===\nThe wrestler jumps down from a raised platform onto an opponent, dropping one foot onto the opponent's body. A variation known as a ''diving double foot stomp'' sees the attacking wrestler jumping down from a raised platform on an opponent driving both feet into the opponent. This move is usually executed by the inaugural [[Universal Champion]] [[Finn Balor]] as his finisher move, ''Coup de Gr\u00e2ce''.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.wwe.com/classics/classic-lists/the-50-coolest-maneuvers-of-all-time/page-22|title=the 50 coolest maneuvers of all time|date=2014-02-21|accessdate=2014-05-04|publisher=WWE}}</ref>\n\n====Moonsault double foot stomp====\nThis variation sees the wrestler perform a moonsault, but instead of landing on a fallen opponent in the [[Professional wrestling attacks#Splash|splash]] position, the wrestler continues the rotation driving both feet into the opponent.
