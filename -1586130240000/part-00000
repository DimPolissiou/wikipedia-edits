It establishes a program of unarmed [[surveillance aircraft|aerial surveillance flights]] over the entire [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] of its participants. The [[treaty]] is designed to enhance mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information about military forces and activities of concern to them. Open Skies is one of the most wide-ranging international efforts to date promoting openness and transparency of military forces and activities. The concept of \"mutual aerial observation\" was initially proposed to [[Soviet Premier]] [[Nikolai Bulganin]] at the Geneva Conference of 1955 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]; however, the Soviets promptly rejected the concept and it lay dormant for several years. The treaty was eventually signed as an initiative of US president (and former Director of Central Intelligence) [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1989. Negotiated by the then-members of [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], the agreement was signed in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], on March 24, 1992.<ref name=stategov/>\n\nThis treaty is not related to civil-aviation [[Freedoms of the air|open skies agreements]].[https://www.osce.org/mc/23457?download=true]\n\n==Membership==\nThe 35 state parties to the Open Skies Treaty are: [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]] (including [[Greenland]]), [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], the [[Russian Federation]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[the United States]].\n[[Kyrgyzstan]] has signed the treaty but has not yet ratified it. [[Canada]] and [[Hungary]] are the Depositories of the treaty in recognition of their special contributions to the Open Skies process. The \"Depository\" countries maintain treaty documents and provide administrative support.\n\nThe Open Skies treaty is one of unlimited duration, and is open to accession by other states. The republics of the [[former Soviet Union]] ([[USSR]]) that have not already become state parties to the treaty may join it at any time. Applications from other interested countries are subject to a [[consensus]] decision by the [[Open Skies Consultative Commission]] (OSCC),<ref name=stategov/> the organization, based in [[Vienna, Austria]], that is charged with carrying out the implementation of the treaty. The [[Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe]] meets monthly at its headquarters in Vienna.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.osce.org/oscc|title=Open Skies Consultative Commission|publisher=}}</ref> \nEight countries have joined into the treaty since it entered into force in 2002: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Slovenia, and Sweden. Notably missing are [[Austria]],[[Cyprus]], [[Switzerland]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Albania]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Moldova]], [[Armenia]] and [[Uzbekistan]].The Republic of [[Cyprus]] has submitted its application to accede the Treaty in 2002, however, since then Turkey blocks its accession.\n\n== Open Skies Consultative Commission ==\nThe '''Open Skies Consultative Commission''' is the implementing body for the Treaty on Open Skies.<ref>{{cite web|title=Treaty on Open Skies|url=http://www.osce.org/oscc|publisher=Open Skies Consultative Commission|accessdate=10 August 2013}}</ref> It meets monthly at the [[Vienna]] headquarters of the [[Organization for Security and Co-Operation in Europe]], and consists of representatives from each of the states that is a party to the treaty.\n\n==Basic elements of the treaty==\n\n===Territory===\nThe Open Skies regulations covers the territory over which the parties exercise sovereignty, including [[mainland]], islands, and internal and territorial waters. The treaty specifies that the entire territory of a member state is open to observation. Observation flights may only be restricted for reasons of flight safety and not for reasons of national security.<ref name=stategov/>\n\n===Aircraft===\n[[Image:Oc-135 xxl.jpg|thumb|A [[United States Air Force|USAF]] [[Boeing OC-135B Open Skies]].]]\nObservation aircraft may be provided by either the observing party or by the observed party (the \"taxi option\"), at the latter's choice. All Open Skies aircraft and sensors must pass specific certification and [[pre-flight inspection]] procedures to ensure that they are compliant with treaty standards.<ref name=stategov/> The official certified U.S. Open Skies aircraft is the [[OC-135B Open Skies]].\n\nCanada uses a [[C-130 Hercules]] aircraft equipped with a \"SAMSON\" sensor pod to conduct flights over other treaty nations. The pod is a converted CC-130 fuel tank modified to carry the permitted sensors, along with associated on-board mission systems. A consortium of nations consisting of Belgium, Netherlands, Luxemburg, Canada, France, Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain own and operate this system. The costs of maintaining the SAMSON Pod are shared, based on each nation's flight quota and actual use.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}\n\n[[Image:An-30ukrainearmy.JPG|thumb| [[An-30]] monitoring aircraft]]\n[[File:Russian Air Force Tu-214ON RA-64519 UUBW 2011-8-12.png|thumb|[[Tupolev Tu-214]]ON of the [[Russian Air Force]].]]\nBulgaria, Romania, Russia and Ukraine use the [[Antonov An-30]] for their flights.

Only two flights were requested over the United States during 2005, by the Russian Federation and Republic of Belarus Group of states parties (which functions as a single entity for quota allocation purposes).

At the summit, Eisenhower asserted, \"I came to Geneva because I believe mankind longs for freedom from war and the rumors of war. I came here because my lasting faith in the decent instincts and good sense of the people who populate this world of ours.\" In this spirit of good will, Eisenhower presented the Soviets with his Open Skies proposal. In it he proposed that each side provide full descriptions of all their military facilities and allow for aerial inspections to insure the information was correct. The Soviets rejected the proposal. Eisenhower was disappointed, but not surprised. In truth, the Open Skies proposal would have benefited the U.S. much more so than the Soviets -- the Russians already knew the location of most American strategic defense facilities, it was the Americans who stood to gain new information.}}</ref> The fears and suspicions of the [[Cold War]] led Soviet General Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to reject Eisenhower's proposal.<ref name = \"eisenhower\"/><ref name=dtra/>\n\nDuring a five-day summit conference held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland at the end of July 1955, the Soviet Union and United States held serious talks about disarmament and the United States put forward proposals for mutual reconnaissance flights over each other's air space, known as the '''Open Skies''' proposal. The United States had a large number of [[B-47 Stratojet|RB-47]] and [[B-36 Peacemaker|RB-36]] reconnaissance aircraft at its disposal for such activities, however the Soviets turned down this proposal. However, this Geneva Conference was universally accepted as a turning point in the Cold War. The tensions in Europe were felt to be a stalemate. However, both the Soviet Union and United States were willing to talk about their differences, rather than increase them into a state of war.\n\nThirty-four years later, the Open Skies concept was reintroduced by President George H. W. Bush as a means to build confidence and security between all [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and [[Warsaw Pact]] countries. In February 1990, an international Open Skies conference involving all NATO and Warsaw Pact countries opened in [[Ottawa, Canada]]. Subsequent rounds of negotiations were held in [[Budapest, Hungary]]; [[Vienna, Austria]]; and [[Helsinki, Finland]].<ref name=dtra/>\n\nOn March 24, 1992,<ref name=\"state.gov\"/> the Open Skies Treaty was signed in Helsinki by Secretary of State [[James Baker]] and foreign ministers from 23 other countries.

Until entry into force in January 2002, DTRA support for the treaty involved participating in training and joint trial flights (JTFs). The U.S. has conducted over 70 JTFs since 1993. By March 2003, DTRA had successfully certified 16 camera configurations on the OC-135B aircraft. They also had contributed to the certification of the Bulgarian An-30, Hungarian [[Antonov An-26|An-26]], POD Group (consisting of Belgium, Canada, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain) C-130H, Romanian An-30, Russian An-30, and Ukrainian An-30.

It establishes a program of unarmed [[surveillance aircraft|aerial surveillance flights]] over the entire [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] of its participants. The [[treaty]] is designed to enhance mutual understanding and confidence by giving all participants, regardless of size, a direct role in gathering information about military forces and activities of concern to them. Open Skies is one of the most wide-ranging international efforts to date promoting openness and transparency of military forces and activities. The concept of \"mutual aerial observation\" was initially proposed to [[Soviet Premier]] [[Nikolai Bulganin]] at the Geneva Conference of 1955 by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]]; however, the Soviets promptly rejected the concept and it lay dormant for several years. The treaty was eventually signed as an initiative of US president (and former Director of Central Intelligence) [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1989. Negotiated by the then-members of [[NATO]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], the agreement was signed in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], on March 24, 1992.<ref name=stategov/>\n\nThis treaty is not related to civil-aviation [[Freedoms of the air|open skies agreements]].\n\nhttps://www.osce.org/mc/23457?download=true==Membership==\nThe 35 state parties to the Open Skies Treaty are: [[Belarus]], [[Belgium]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Canada]], [[Croatia]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Denmark]] (including [[Greenland]]), [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[France]], the [[Georgia (country)|Republic of Georgia]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Hungary]], [[Iceland]], [[Italy]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Luxembourg]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], the [[Russian Federation]], [[Slovakia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], [[Ukraine]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[the United States]].\n[[Kyrgyzstan]] has signed the treaty but has not yet ratified it.

The United States is entitled to 8 of the 31 annual flights available over Russia/Belarus. Additionally, the United States is entitled to one flight over Ukraine, which is shared with Canada.\n\n===Data sharing and availability===\nImagery collected from Open Skies missions is available to any state party upon request for the cost of reproduction. As a result, the data available to each state party is much greater than that which it can collect itself under the treaty quota system.<ref name=stategov/>\n\n==History==\nAt a [[Geneva Summit (1955)|Geneva Conference]] meeting with [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikolai Bulganin]] in 1955, President Eisenhower proposed that the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]] conduct [[surveillance]] overflights of each other's territory to reassure each country that the other was not preparing to attack.<ref name = \"eisenhower\">{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/eisenhower-foreign/ |title=Foreign Affairs |work=[[American Experience]] |publisher=WGBH Educational Foundation |date= |accessdate=28 July 2013 |quote=The two sides would not meet face-to-face until the Geneva summit of 1955. At the summit, Eisenhower asserted, \"I came to Geneva because I believe mankind longs for freedom from war and the rumors of war. I came here because my lasting faith in the decent instincts and good sense of the people who populate this world of ours.\" In this spirit of good will, Eisenhower presented the Soviets with his Open Skies proposal. In it he proposed that each side provide full descriptions of all their military facilities and allow for aerial inspections to insure the information was correct. The Soviets rejected the proposal. Eisenhower was disappointed, but not surprised. In truth, the Open Skies proposal would have benefited the U.S. much more so than the Soviets -- the Russians already knew the location of most American strategic defense facilities, it was the Americans who stood to gain new information.}}</ref> The fears and suspicions of the [[Cold War]] led Soviet General Secretary [[Nikita Khrushchev]] to reject Eisenhower's proposal.<ref name = \"eisenhower\"/><ref name=dtra/>\n\nDuring a five-day summit conference held in [[Geneva]], Switzerland at the end of July 1955, the Soviet Union and United States held serious talks about disarmament and the United States put forward proposals for mutual reconnaissance flights over each other's air space, known as the '''Open Skies''' proposal. The United States had a large number of [[B-47 Stratojet|RB-47]] and [[B-36 Peacemaker|RB-36]] reconnaissance aircraft at its disposal for such activities, however the Soviets turned down this proposal. However, this Geneva Conference was universally accepted as a turning point in the Cold War. The tensions in Europe were felt to be a stalemate. However, both the Soviet Union and United States were willing to talk about their differences, rather than increase them into a state of war.\n\nThirty-four years later, the Open Skies concept was reintroduced by President George H. W. Bush as a means to build confidence and security between all [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) and [[Warsaw Pact]] countries. In February 1990, an international Open Skies conference involving all NATO and Warsaw Pact countries opened in [[Ottawa, Canada]]. Subsequent rounds of negotiations were held in [[Budapest, Hungary]]; [[Vienna, Austria]]; and [[Helsinki, Finland]].<ref name=dtra/>\n\nOn March 24, 1992,<ref name=\"state.gov\"/> the Open Skies Treaty was signed in Helsinki by Secretary of State [[James Baker]] and foreign ministers from 23 other countries.

Until entry into force in January 2002, DTRA support for the treaty involved participating in training and joint trial flights (JTFs). The U.S. has conducted over 70 JTFs since 1993. By March 2003, DTRA had successfully certified 16 camera configurations on the OC-135B aircraft. They also had contributed to the certification of the Bulgarian An-30, Hungarian [[Antonov An-26|An-26]], POD Group (consisting of Belgium, Canada, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal and Spain) C-130H, Romanian An-30, Russian An-30, and Ukrainian An-30.

China then went on to develop a domestic [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] and the first aircraft made its maiden flight in 2003.\n\nFour KJ-2000 aircraft have been identified so far, but production of new aircraft will likely be delayed, dependent on the acquisition of IL-76 airframes. Currently, the Russian defense exporter [[Rosoboronexport]] has imposed a significant price hike on all future IL-76s delivered to China and India despite previous contracts. Both countries are currently in negotiation with Russia regarding this matter as of early 2008. In March 2011, Russia/China negotiations reached a new agreement to move production of IL-76s to Chinese owned companies, in this way it is expected production can be run smoothly to supply China with new IL-76 airframes, while delivery of [[Soloviev D-30]]KP-2 engines is not affected by recent issues.<ref name=\"AirForceWorld.com_IL76_russia_china_export_agreement_2011\">{{cite web |url=http://airforceworld.com/pla/il-76-transporter-china.htm |title=IL76 russia china export agreement2011 |work=AirForceWorld.com |accessdate=30 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303183904/http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/il-76-transporter-china.htm |archivedate=3 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDue to unreliable external supplier sources, China has developed a backup known as the [[KJ-200]] by installing a simplified system on board the [[Shaanxi Y-8]]. This aircraft has a similar configuration to that of the KJ-2000 and is characterized by the triple tail-fin configuration (one large and two small).\n\n==Design==\nThe Chinese AWACS has a phased array radar (PAR) carried in a round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their rotodomes to give a 360{{nbh}}degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a triangular configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360{{nbh}}degree coverage. The multi-function, three-dimensional pulse-Doppler radar was developed by NII (Nanjing Electronic Technology Research Institute), and is designed to detect and track airborne and surface targets. It operates in the frequency range of 1200\u20131400 MHz. The antenna system consists of three phased arrays, located in a {{convert|14|m|ft|adj=mid|-diameter|}} disc. In contrast, the Russian [[Beriev A-50]] and American [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]] use a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} disc. Each phased array has a 120-degree field of view. Maximum range of detection of air targets is {{cvt|470|km|||}}.

China then went on to develop a domestic [[Airborne Early Warning and Control|AWACS]] and the first aircraft made its maiden flight in 2003.\n\nFour KJ-2000 aircraft have been identified so far, but production of new aircraft will likely be delayed, dependent on the acquisition of IL-76 airframes. Currently, the Russian defense exporter [[Rosoboronexport]] has imposed a significant price hike on all future IL-76s delivered to China and India despite previous contracts. Both countries are currently in negotiation with Russia regarding this matter as of early 2008. In March 2011, Russia/China negotiations reached a new agreement to move production of IL-76s to Chinese owned companies, in this way it is expected production can be run smoothly to supply China with new IL-76 airframes, while delivery of [[Soloviev D-30]]KP-2 engines is not affected by recent issues.<ref name=\"AirForceWorld.com_IL76_russia_china_export_agreement_2011\">{{cite web |url=http://airforceworld.com/pla/il-76-transporter-china.htm |title=IL76 russia china export agreement2011 |work=AirForceWorld.com |accessdate=30 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303183904/http://www.airforceworld.com/pla/il-76-transporter-china.htm |archivedate=3 March 2011 }}</ref>\n\nDue to unreliable external supplier sources, China has developed a backup known as the [[KJ-200]] by installing a simplified system on board the [[Shaanxi Y-8]]. This aircraft has a similar configuration to that of the KJ-2000 and is characterized by the triple tail-fin configuration (one large and two small).\n\n==Design==\nThe Chinese AWACS has a phased array radar (PAR) carried in a round radome. Unlike the US AWACS aircraft, which rotate their rotodomes to give a 360{{nbh}}degree coverage, the radar antenna of the Chinese AWACS does not rotate. Instead, three PAR antenna modules are placed in a triangular configuration inside the round radome to provide a 360{{nbh}}degree coverage. The multi-function, three-dimensional pulse-Doppler radar was developed by NII (Nanjing Electronic Technology Research Institute), and is designed to detect and track airborne and surface targets. It operates in the frequency range of 1200\u20131400 MHz. The antenna system consists of three phased arrays, located in a {{convert|14|m|ft|adj=mid|-diameter|}} disc. In contrast, the Russian [[Beriev A-50]] and American [[Boeing E-3 Sentry]] use a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=mid|-diameter}} disc. Each phased array has a 120-degree field of view. Maximum range of detection of air targets is {{cvt|470|km|||}}.

The base was re-built and re-equipped for handling the KJ-2000, the first of which reached the base in 2005. A mixed fleet of KJ-2000 and the smaller [[KJ-200]] has been operated at the base. During 2006 a war exercise was held in north west China, during which a KJ-2000 and KJ-200 were deployed from the regiment for evaluation.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Finally in 2013 a 24-hour coverage drill was held using three KJ-2000s that covered NW China, the East China Sea, and the South China Sea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2013/china-130406-cna01.htm|title=China holds airborne early warning drill targeting Japan: report|author=John Pike|accessdate=4 February 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205014107/http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/2013/china-130406-cna01.htm|archive-date=5 December 2014|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nRecent satellite photos show eight new Shaanxi [[KJ-500]] airborne early warning and control, or [[Airborne_early_warning_and_control|AEW&C]] aircraft at the company's factory airfield at Hanzhong, Shaanxi Province in mid-December 2017.

It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who, during an assignment covering the annual [[Groundhog Day]] event, is caught in a [[time loop]], repeatedly reliving the same day. [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[Chris Elliott]] co-star.\n\n''Groundhog Day'' was a modest success on release and garnered generally positive reviews. It later attracted critical acclaim and is often included in lists of the best comedy films. The term \"groundhog day\" is now commonly used in the English language to describe a recurring situation. In 2006, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Films Added to National Film Registry for 2006 |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2006/06-234.html |access-date=May 5, 2010}}</ref> [[Groundhog Day (musical)|A stage musical adaptation]] premiered in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nOn February 1st, weatherman Phil Connors reassures [[Pittsburgh]] viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss [[Western Pennsylvania]]. He goes with news producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]], to cover the [[Groundhog Day]] festivities, which he has done for several years. Phil makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there.\n\nThe next day, February 2nd, Phil awakens at his Punxsutawney [[bed and breakfast]] to [[Sonny & Cher]]'s \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" on the clock radio. He tapes a half-hearted report on [[Punxsutawney Phil]] and the town's festivities. Rita wants to stay and cover other events, but Phil wants to return to Pittsburgh. The blizzard blankets the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.\n\nPhil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio, and discovers the day's events repeating exactly. Phil relives the day and returns to bed, assuming it was a dream, but it is again February 2nd when he wakes : he is trapped in a [[time loop]] that no one else is aware of. Realizing there are no consequences for his actions, he spends the first several loops indulging in binge eating and drinking, one-night stands, robbery, and reckless driving. After spending several loops trying and failing to court Rita, he becomes depressed and desperate for a solution to end the loop. He tries numerous times to commit suicide, including going so far as to kidnap Punxsutawney Phil and drive off a cliff with him, but he continuously wakes up to \"I Got You Babe\" on the radio.\n\nPhil tries to explain his situation to Rita, for whom he has feelings, by accurately predicting the day's events. Rita sympathizes, and they spend the entirety of one loop together, but Phil wakes up alone as usual. He decides to use his knowledge of the day's events to better himself and the lives of others; he learns how to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French, but is unable to save a homeless man, who dies regardless of his actions.\n\nDuring one loop, Phil enthusiastically reports the Groundhog Day festivities, amazing Rita. They spend the rest of the day together, and Phil impresses her with his apparent overnight transformation and charitable deeds. She successfully bids for Phil at a charity bachelor auction. Phil makes an ice sculpture of Rita's face, and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue awakening alone each morning forever, he wants her to know that he is finally happy, because he loves her. They retire together to Phil's lodgings. Phil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" again, but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter is different; it is now February 3rd, he has escaped the time loop. He tells Rita he wants to live together with her in Punxsutawney.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Andiegroundhog.png|thumb|Andie MacDowell with a groundhog, 2008]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Rita Hanson\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Larry the cameraman\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Ned Ryerson\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Buster Green\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Mrs. Lancaster\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Gus\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Ralph\n* [[Robin Duke]] as Doris the waitress\n* [[Marita Geraghty]] as Nancy Taylor\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Neurologist\n* [[Richard Henzel]] as D.J. #1\n* Rob Riley as D.J. #2\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Hynden Walch]] as Debbie the bride\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Fred the groom\n* Rod Sell as Groundhog official\n* [[Ken Hudson Campbell]] as Man in the hallway\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Concept===\nDanny Rubin had completed and sold his script for ''[[Hear No Evil (1993 film)|Hear No Evil]]'' and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles to become a professional screenwriter around 1990.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/08/07/how-i-wrote-the-script-for-groundhog-day-in-less-than-a-week/ | title = How I wrote the script for Groundhog Day in less than a week | first = Danny | last = Rubin | date = August 7, 2016 | accessdate = February 27, 2017 | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] }}</ref> His agent suggested that he prepare a \"calling-card\" script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He came up with the core idea of the script which would become ''Groundhog Day'' while sitting in a movie theater.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He asked himself the question \"If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, how would they change over time?\"<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\">{{Cite web | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-danny-rubin | title = Big Think Interview With Danny Rubin | first=  Paul | last = Hoffman | date = May 10, 2010 | accessdate = February 24, 2017 | work = [[Big Think]] }}</ref> Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming.

Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and \"rules\" for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin started to shop the screenplay to around 50 producers. While many studios expressed interest, they told him they would not be able to film it, though Rubin was able to secure additional work through these meetings. After his own agent left the industry, Rubin hired a [[Spec script|spec agent]] to help sell the script more.

It stars [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors, a TV weatherman who, during an assignment covering the annual [[Groundhog Day]] event, is caught in a [[time loop]], repeatedly reliving the same day. [[Andie MacDowell]] and [[Chris Elliott]] co-star.\n\n''Groundhog Day'' was a modest success on release and garnered generally positive reviews. It later attracted critical acclaim and is often included in lists of the best comedy films. The term \"groundhog day\" is now commonly used in the English language to describe a recurring situation. In 2006, the film was added to the United States [[National Film Registry]] as being deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\".<ref>{{Cite press release |title=Films Added to National Film Registry for 2006 |date=December 27, 2006 |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2006/06-234.html |access-date=May 5, 2010}}</ref> [[Groundhog Day (musical)|A stage musical adaptation]] premiered in 2016.\n\n==Plot==\nOn February 1st, weatherman Phil Connors reassures [[Pittsburgh]] viewers that an approaching blizzard will miss [[Western Pennsylvania]]. He goes with news producer Rita Hanson and cameraman Larry to [[Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania]], to cover the [[Groundhog Day]] festivities, which he has done for several years. Phil makes no secret of his contempt for the assignment, the small town, and the \"hicks\" who live there.\n\nThe next day, February 2nd, Phil awakens at his Punxsutawney [[bed and breakfast]] to [[Sonny & Cher]]'s \"[[I Got You Babe]]\" on the clock radio. He tapes a half-hearted report on [[Punxsutawney Phil]] and the town's festivities. Rita wants to stay and cover other events, but Phil wants to return to Pittsburgh. The blizzard blankets the region in snow, stranding them in Punxsutawney. Phil shuns the celebrations and retires to bed early.\n\nPhil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" and the same DJ banter on the radio, and discovers the day's events repeating exactly. Phil relives the day and returns to bed, assuming it was a dream, but it is again February 2nd when he wakes : he is trapped in a [[time loop]] that no one else is aware of. Realizing there are no consequences for his actions, he spends the first several loops indulging in binge eating and drinking, one-night stands, robbery, and reckless driving. After spending several loops trying and failing to court Rita, he becomes depressed and desperate for a solution to end the loop. He tries numerous times to commit suicide, including going so far as to kidnap Punxsutawney Phil and drive off a cliff with him, but he continuously wakes up to \"I Got You Babe\" on the radio.\n\nPhil tries to explain his situation to Rita, for whom he has feelings, by accurately predicting the day's events. Rita sympathizes, and they spend the entirety of one loop together, but Phil wakes up alone as usual. He decides to use his knowledge of the day's events to better himself and the lives of others; he learns how to play the piano, sculpt ice, and speak French, but is unable to save a homeless man, who dies regardless of his actions.\n\nDuring one loop, Phil enthusiastically reports the Groundhog Day festivities, amazing Rita. They spend the rest of the day together, and Phil impresses her with his apparent overnight transformation and charitable deeds. She successfully bids for Phil at a charity bachelor auction. Phil makes an ice sculpture of Rita's face, and tells her that no matter what happens, even if he is doomed to continue awakening alone each morning forever, he wants her to know that he is finally happy, because he loves her. They retire together to Phil's lodgings. Phil wakes to \"I Got You Babe\" again, but finds Rita is still in bed with him and the radio banter is different; it is now February 3rd, he has escaped the time loop. He tells Rita he wants to live together with her in Punxsutawney.\n\n== Cast ==\n[[File:Andiegroundhog.png|thumb|Andie MacDowell with a groundhog, 2008]]\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Bill Murray]] as Phil Connors\n* [[Andie MacDowell]] as Rita Hanson\n* [[Chris Elliott]] as Larry the cameraman\n* [[Stephen Tobolowsky]] as Ned Ryerson\n* [[Brian Doyle-Murray]] as Buster Green\n* [[Angela Paton]] as Mrs. Lancaster\n* [[Rick Ducommun]] as Gus\n* [[Rick Overton]] as Ralph\n* [[Robin Duke]] as Doris the waitress\n* [[Marita Geraghty]] as Nancy Taylor\n* [[Harold Ramis]] as Neurologist\n* [[Richard Henzel]] as D.J. #1\n* Rob Riley as D.J. #2\n* [[David Pasquesi]] as Psychiatrist\n* [[Hynden Walch]] as Debbie the bride\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Fred the groom\n* Rod Sell as Groundhog official\n* [[Ken Hudson Campbell]] as Man in the hallway\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n===Concept===\nDanny Rubin had completed and sold his script for ''[[Hear No Evil (1993 film)|Hear No Evil]]'' and moved from Chicago to Los Angeles to become a professional screenwriter around 1990.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\">{{cite web | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2016/08/07/how-i-wrote-the-script-for-groundhog-day-in-less-than-a-week/ | title = How I wrote the script for Groundhog Day in less than a week | first = Danny | last = Rubin | date = August 7, 2016 | accessdate = February 27, 2017 | work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] }}</ref> His agent suggested that he prepare a \"calling-card\" script that he could use to gain meetings with various producers.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He came up with the core idea of the script which would become ''Groundhog Day'' while sitting in a movie theater.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> He asked himself the question \"If a person could live forever, if a person was immortal, how would they change over time?\"<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\">{{Cite web | url = http://bigthink.com/videos/big-think-interview-with-danny-rubin | title = Big Think Interview With Danny Rubin | first=  Paul | last = Hoffman | date = May 10, 2010 | accessdate = February 24, 2017 | work = [[Big Think]] }}</ref> Having this character be immortal and having the world change around them would have been too cumbersome for filming. Instead he came back to a concept he had written down about two years earlier about a man living the same day over and over. With the idea of a person changing over time, this repeating day motif found its \"deeper purpose\" within the new script.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/> The two ideas, combined, answered his proverbial question as well as opened up several possibilities of drama and comedy with that framework.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin first conceived of the dating aspect for the film, \"being able to use your superior knowledge to pick up women\", which led to the film leaning more to the comedy side.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> He knew he needed some calendar date to use for the day, and his earlier concept had the character reliving a late January day over and over; when he looked at his calendar, he saw Groundhog Day, February 2, as a date with great potential as a recognized holiday but one with little fanfare, and a date on which the film could be played annually, similar to Christmas or Halloween specials. Groundhog Day also presented Rubin with the idea of being able to take his character out of his home town into the unfamiliar territory and relative isolation of Punxsutawney, and cementing the character being named Phil in honor of Punxsutawney Phil, as well as making him a weatherman.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/><ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rubin took about seven weeks to fix the basic concepts and \"rules\" for the time loop in the film, and then completed the first draft of the screenplay within three to four days.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/>\n\nRubin started to shop the screenplay to around 50 producers. While many studios expressed interest, they told him they would not be able to film it, though Rubin was able to secure additional work through these meetings. After his own agent left the industry, Rubin hired a [[Spec script|spec agent]] to help sell the script more. The script got to the hands of Richard Lovett in the [[Creative Artists Agency]], who was able to get it to Harold Ramis around 1991, leading to Ramis offering to produce the film.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/><ref name=\"new yorker\"/>\n\n===Writing and casting===\nIn the first draft of the script, Rubin had not wanted to have to explain to the audience how Phil got in the loop, and so had the movie start ''[[in medias res]]'', with Phil already in the midst of the looping; the audience would have followed one of his days after waking up to \"I Got You Babe\" where he is already aware of what will be happening, and thus provoking the audience's curiosity; the film would then have used voice-over narration by Phil to provide some of the backstory.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> Rita would also confess to being trapped in a time loop of her own.<ref name=\"Mentalfloss\">{{cite web|last1=Cormier|first1=Roger|title=16 Repeatable Facts About 'Groundhog Day'|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/70147/16-repeatable-facts-about-groundhog-day|website=Mental Floss|accessdate=March 26, 2016}}</ref> Rubin considered this draft to be more in line with the black comedy ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'', particularly with regards to how Phil's suicides were presented.<ref name=\"telegraph interview\"/>\n\nWhile Ramis wanted to keep this approach, the studio applied pressure to use a more standard narrative structure, forcing Rubin to rewrite the script under Ramis's direction.<ref name=\"bigthink rubin\"/> A major change was to restructure the film as a standard three-act piece.<ref name=\"uproxx rift\">{{cite web | url = http://uproxx.com/movies/the-story-behind-bill-murray-and-harold-ramis-21-year-rift/ | title = The Story Behind Bill Murray And Harold Ramis's 21 Year Rift | first = Dariel | last = Figueroa | date = September 21, 2014 | accessdate = February 25, 2017 | work = [[Uproxx]] }}</ref> This second draft of the screenplay established the reason for Phil being put in a time loop, according to actor [[Eddie Deezen]].
