He is the main opponent of the vicar, yet as the series progresses, he comes to respect her. A notorious town bully, he controlled the Council without any opposition until the Vicar's arrival, and is consequently disliked by many, being rigid, old-fashioned, efficient, callous and punctual, yet as the show progresses, becomes lovable and endearing. Apart from the vicar, he is the only sane person in the village. Despite regularly complaining about the council, he has never missed a meeting. In fact, in one episode Jim and Owen reminisce about when David's wife went into labour with Hugo, and David held the meeting in the maternity ward. His wife left him prior to the show's beginning due to his obnoxious nature (although he mistakenly believes she left him because he was a bad cook.) In later episodes of the series, Horton comes to fall for the Vicar and even proposes to her (she accepts his proposal but later decides to back out). He is initially a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], but defects to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2000 as part of his attempt to persuade Geraldine to marry him, though by the 2004 episode \"Happy New Year\" he is a Conservative Party supporter again. His love for the vicar, however, is steadfast and true. He later supported the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign. He is a multi-millionaire. Hugo mentions that people used to call him \"Dirty Dave\" due to his collection of Victorian pornography. David was an unloving father to Hugo, and even threatened to disinherit him if he married Alice, whom David detests. However he changed his mind and later admitted to the Vicar that Alice and Hugo are happy together.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Alice Horton ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Alice Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Emma Chambers]]\n| years= 1994\u20132011\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = {{unbulleted list|\"Wife Swap\"|<small>(Comic Relief 2007)</small>}}\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother = Mrs Tinker\n| sisters = Mary Tinker\n| husband = Hugo Horton (1998\u2014)\n| sons = At least 4 sons\n| daughters = Geraldine Horton <br> 5 others\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| occupation = Verger, nursery assistant\n}}\n'''Alice Springs Horton''' (n\u00e9e '''Tinker''') is the [[verger]] at the church. Blonde and scatterbrained (Geraldine describes her as having \"the intellectual capacity and charisma of a [[cactus]]\"), Alice is the only main character who does not sit on the parish council, although she did in the episode \"Autumn.\" She is the product of a one-night stand between her [[insanity|mad]] mother (who in the last two episodes is said to be in a mental home) and the cousin of David Horton's father (present-day David Horton's first cousin once removed and predecessor on the parish council), also called David Horton. She and Hugo, her second cousin once removed, are fond of each other and the vicar plays [[Cupid]] successfully in one episode. They eventually marry and have ten children - the eldest, Geraldine, was born on 24 December 1999, in the middle of the village nativity play in which her parents were playing Mary and Joseph. Featuring in the closing credits for most episodes, Geraldine and Alice have a cup of tea while Geraldine tries to tell Alice a joke (frequently the joke is slightly off-colour). Alice rarely understands the jokes that Geraldine tells her and usually proceeds to over-analyse the humour thereby completely killing the joke. In the final episode Geraldine's new husband Harry Kennedy explains the grammar involved and Alice finally understands it. Alice believes in the [[Easter Bunny]], [[Father Christmas]] and the [[tooth fairy]]. After reading ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' she believes herself to be descended from [[Jesus]]. She is dim-witted and naive but also sweet-natured and very endearing. She has many misconceptions, such as mistaking [[Black Sabbath]] for gospel singers, telling David that Jesus was one of [[The Carpenters]] and referring to [[Albert Einstein]] as Andrew Einstein. Alice is a fan of the [[Wombles]] and of the [[Teletubbies]]. In episode 12, January 22, 1998, when Alice married Hugo Horton, her bridesmaids are La-La and Po, who hold the wedding-dress train of Alice.\nAs a child Alice had a series of budgies named Carrot and, until Geraldine reveals that each Carrot was a separate budgie entirely, Alice believed that her first budgie Carrot was reincarnated, \"Just like Jesus, but with feathers\". Alice also has a sister, Mary, who is older than Alice but is even more dim-witted. Alice's mother is often described as insane by Geraldine, and there is considerable confusion regarding Alice's father. Although she states that her father (revealed to be a philanderer) is dead, she later names David Horton, the cousin of the councillor David Horton's father as her biological father, but she often claims not to know who her father really was.\n\nA rabid fan of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', Alice unsuccessfully tries to incorporate themes from the sci-fi show into her wedding, including having a wedding gown \"with lots of hearts on it...and a different [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who]] in each one.\" However, she ends up with a gown decorated with a massive heart with hers and Hugo's names inside. She succeeds in having a ''Doctor Who'' wedding during Geraldine's own wedding. When Gerry's friends take over wedding preparations, Alice uses her position as maid of honour to dress herself as the [[Tenth Doctor]] and the other bridesmaids as [[Dalek]]s.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Hugo Horton ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Hugo Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[James Fleet]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013, 2015\n| first= \"The Arrival\"\n| last= ''Comic Relief Sketch 2015''\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born=\n| father= David Horton\n| mother=\n| brothers=\n| sisters= 1 Illegitimate\n| wife= Alice Tinker (1998\u2014)\n| sons= 4 sons\n| daughters= {{unbulleted list|Geraldine Horton|5 others}}\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts=\n| uncles=Simon Horton\n| grandmothers=\n| grandfathers=\n| nephews=\n| occupation = Council member, David Horton's campaign manager\n}}\n'''Hugo Horton''' is David's sweet-natured, friendly yet dim-witted and childlike son; Geraldine once also likens his intellect to a cactus. In \"Celebrity Vicar\", a newspaper describes him in the headline \"Rich as [[Croesus]], Thick as Shit\"; Hugo does not think the press meant to be rude, to which David replies \"Though you can't deny it's a possibility.\" Sometimes seen sporting a [[Royal Agricultural College]] tie, he served as his father's campaign manager at the October 1994 district council election, but inadvertently wound up going door to door with David's Labour opponent, Kevin Smewyn, delivering adverts and making introductions for him. Hugo and Alice Tinker are always shown to have tender feelings for each other, but they do not get together as a couple until Geraldine plays Cupid in \"Engagement\". David was never a loving nor affectionate father to Hugo, dominating him and undermining all his dreams and ambitions. In one episode, Geraldine mentions that God is a father much like his own father, and Hugo recalls what his father did to him as a child: shouting, insulting and caning him (although he does mention a time when David pretended to be [[Father Christmas]]). When Geraldine corrects him and says she was referring to a loving, caring father, Hugo believes he had another father. Despite this, Hugo still loves and respects his father but finally stands up to him when it came to marrying Alice, whom David predictably despises. He nicknames Geraldine \"Mrs God\". Hugo has a Golden Retriever named Bruno who is seen in \"Animals\" and \"Election\".  He is a huge fan of [[Kylie Minogue]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Frank Pickle ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Frank Pickle\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[John Bluthal]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief Sketch 2013''\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| sisters = 2 (unknown names)\n| husband =\n| children= 1 (unknown name)\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| uncles =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| relatives = Wilfred (second cousin)\n| romances = Justin (1948)\n| occupation = Secretary\n}}\n'''Frank Pickle''' (born 1934) is the likable but boring and [[pedantic]] secretary of the parish council. He is so boring that nobody listens to him, even when he tries to relate such momentous events such as \"the time he went down to the pub and they'd completely run out of crisps\" or \"the time when the milkman was 47 minutes late\" or \"when he heard a cuckoo in March, only it turned out to be a pigeon\". In \"Celebrity Vicar\", while trying to get \"crazy anecdotes\" about Geraldine for a journalist with all the details, the newspaper headline asks \"Is this The Most Boring Man in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]?\" Due to his tendency to go on and on when given the opportunity, it is said that five people, including his parents, have died while he was talking, and even his therapist accused him of being boring. He decided to declare his [[homosexuality]] in a radio broadcast to the village (after over 40 years of keeping it secret), but apart from Geraldine, who was with Frank at the time, none of the villagers listened to his broadcast. The next day, he decides to assert his sexuality more openly by wearing a bright cerise blazer to attend the parish council meeting rather than his usual brown one. Other references in the show suggest that Frank is [[bisexual]], as he also once admitted to fancying [[Margaret Beckett]] as well as fellow councilors Owen Newitt and David Horton; is as affected by the naked model in the Dibley Parish Life Art Class as the others and painted the same model in the landscape class. He also admitted to sleeping with Owen's cousin Sally and it is implied that he fathered one of her three children (the other two being fathered by Jim and Owen). He defines his ideal man as a 25-year-old South American with an interest in Oxfordshire council procedures. \n\n\"He also gives Alice away at her wedding but wears a sign which states that he is not Alice's father and also tries to put a note in the programme that states that he is not Alice's father but is a close family friend and has \"not had sexual relations with Mrs Tinker in any way whatsoever\".\" \n{{Clear}}\n\n== Jim Trott ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Jim Trott\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Trevor Peacock]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013, 2015\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief Sketch 2015''\n| classification = Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| brothers =\n| spouse = {{unbulleted list|Duane <small>(?? - ??)</small>|Doris Trott <small>(1955\u2013mid 1990s; widowed/divorced)</small>}}\n| sons =\n| daughters =\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| uncles =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| second cousins =\n| occupation = Council member, Farmer\n}}\n'''Jim Trott''' is a parish council member, who has an [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] way of prefacing \"no-no-no-no-no...\" to almost everything he says, in particular \"yes!\" A newspaper in \"Celebrity Vicar\" gives him the headline \"No, No, No, No Brain\". His stuttering once led him to lose on ''[[Deal or No Deal (UK game show)|Deal or No Deal]]''. His wife Doris does the opposite, saying \"yes-yes-yes-yes-yes...\". Jim used to be a good dancer, though an unconvincing singer. Despite being married to Doris, he has no qualms about joining Owen in openly flirting with the Vicar, frequently commenting on her \"lovely arse\". He is also openly promiscuous with a penchant for young blondes and Eastern beauties. In one episode he learns that Doris is having sex with her cousin Brenda. In the final episode, he proposed to the vicar, suggesting that he is no longer married, perhaps through divorce, or that his wife has died prior to this episode or that he is willing to commit [[bigamy]]. He became the church organist after the death of Letitia Cropley.

He lives alone at the farm with his animals and is famous for displaying extremely poor personal hygiene, compounded with chronic problems with his stomach and bowels, both resulting in flatulence. The newspaper in \"Celebrity Vicar\" dubbed him \"Britain's [[Body odor|B.O.]] King\". He was the first to support the new vicar's appointment as a lone dissenter, saying that a woman would not be a bad thing since the previous vicar was \"a regular old woman anyway\", just as David looked set to persuade the other members of the parish council to oppose Geraldine's appointment. His signature running gag was that he was chronically late for the parish council meetings, and had humorously legitimate, if gruesome, reasons for his delays (often involving graphic tales of amputating animals' appendages or otherwise mangling them). Previous generations of his family also appear to be as bloodthirsty as Owen, as he proudly declares they have been \"staging cock-fights\" and \"gassing badgers\" in the village for several centuries, and he also has a few murderers in his family. He also has had a history of \"sorrow and tragedy, \" according to Jim and Frank: his brother drowned himself, because of his girlfriend's refusing to marry him; his father shot himself shortly after his wife left him; and his grandmother tried to leave, but his grandfather shot ''her'' and then himself. Owen proposed to the vicar in \"Engagement\". She rejected him, mainly because she simply did not love him (she also cited, not to his face, that \"his breath smells like [[nerve agent|nerve gas]]\" and the [[gel]] on his hair is really [[lard]]). He was not upset, having found out that she was a drinker and declares he cannot tolerate women who drink. Despite this, he frequently makes crude and misguided attempts at flirting with her, which typically backfire, and even proposed to her again the night before her wedding to Harry Kennedy. Regardless of his foul mouth and coarse nature, Owen is a genuinely kind-hearted and caring person, a fact noted by the Vicar, Hugo and Alice, both of whom appointed him [[Godparent|godfather]] to their firstborn daughter. Owen spent every [[Christmas]] alone since his uncle's death in 1971 until Geraldine joined him for Christmas dinner in 1996 (one of many such invitations she accepted that year). In several episodes, dialogue suggests that Owen engages in [[bestiality]] (such as when he declares rumours that the vicar is a lesbian to be the \"best news since they made having sex with animals legal again\"). Owen also has a swearing 'probling' and often  uses the word 'bloody,' describing the word as 'a useful adjective'.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Letitia Cropley ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Letitia Cropley\n| image=\n| caption=\n| portrayer=[[Liz Smith (actress)|Liz Smith]]\n| years=1994\u201396\n| first= \"The Arrival\"\n| last= \"The Easter Bunny\"\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born=\n| died=Spring 1996\n| father=\n| mother=\n| brothers=\n| sisters= 1 (unknown name)\n| husband=\n| sons=\n| daughters=\n| grandsons=\n| granddaughters=\n| aunts=\n| uncles=\n| grandmothers=\n| grandfathers=\n| nephews=\n| second cousins=\n| occupation= Council member, organist\n}}\n'''Letitia Cropley''' was a Parish Council member and the Dibley church [[organist]].

Letitia only appeared in the first series and the special \"The Easter Bunny\", in which she died. Her dying request to Geraldine was that she take over from her as the Easter Bunny, taking chocolate eggs around the village each Easter. However, when Geraldine saw every member of the parish council doing the same, as well as some other residents, it became clear that she had made the same request to all of them, owing to her forgetful nature. Earlier in the episode she said she had a \"memory like an elephant that's lost its memory\".\nAfter her death, Jim and Frank referred to her as a redheaded beauty in her youth, along with Owen's father having talked of her often, with various nicknames such as 'Luscious Letitia,' Titillatin' Tish,' and 'always lets you dock your boat in her jetty Letty'. In her youth, she was notoriously promiscuous, with Jim and David both describing her as \"rampant\" and a \"[[nymphomaniac]].\" It has also been suggested that she has a crush on Frank and thinks he has 'nice thighs', as she admitted on her death bed.

Over the course of the following days, Harry and Geraldine go on a succession of dates together, which culminate in the two sharing a kiss. Their romance takes a brief knock when Harry's sister Rosie ([[Keeley Hawes]]) visits him in Dibley and Geraldine mistakes her for Harry's romantic partner. However, Harry proposes to Geraldine, who ecstatically agrees to marry him. Their wedding is the focal point of the final regular episode of the series, ''The Vicar in White''. Harry briefly appears once more in the 2007 special sketch for Comic Relief, in which he and Geraldine participate in ''Celebrity, Non-Entity Wife Swap'', in which [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] moves in with Geraldine for a week, while Harry spends a week with [[Trudie Styler]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n===Alice and Hugo's children===\n\n'''Geraldine Horton:''' The daughter of Alice and Hugo Horton. She was born on Christmas Eve 1999 during Geraldine Granger's nativity play, when Alice and Hugo played Mary and Joseph. She has nine siblings. Her grandfather, David Horton, pities baby Geraldine and her siblings for being born to their simple-minded parents yet it is evident that they adore their daughter. A statue was made of Geraldine, as an infant, on the village green. She appears in the episodes \"Winter\", \"Spring\" and \"Summer\" and again with all nine of her siblings in a Christmas special. In the Christmas special Horton is presented, along with her five sisters, in pink tutus or pink plaid skirts and other accessories such as pink fur ponchoes. She is the only child of Hugo and Alice whose name is mentioned. In the \"Merry Christmas\" episode, when the Horton children are revealed, Geraldine stands in the centre in front of her father (holding her youngest brother) and brothers and stands behind her four sisters and next to her mother (holding the youngest sister). Alice and Hugo had planned on naming their first born \"Vicar\" after the vicar but Geraldine suggests the name \"Geraldine\" instead and this becomes the child's name.\n\nAlice and Hugo's other children only ever appeared as a cameo in the 2004 Christmas Special.  They had 10 children (four sons and six daughters).  As seen in a documentary of the 2004/05 specials DVD release, a scene with Geraldine greeting the children revealing their outrageous names was cut before the show went in front of cameras.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:BBC-related lists|Vicar of Dibley]]\n[[Category:Lists of British sitcom television characters|Vicar of Dibley]]\n[[Category:The Vicar of Dibley|Characters]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{refimprove|date=June 2013}}\n{{overly detailed|date=February 2013}}\n{{in-universe|date=February 2013}}\n}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''The Vicar of Dibley'' characters}}\nA list of characters in the BBC sitcom ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'':\n\n== The Revd Geraldine Granger ==\n\n{{main|Geraldine Granger}}\n\n== David Horton ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = David Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Gary Waldhorn]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief 2013''\n| classification = Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| brothers = Simon Horton\n| wife =\n| sons = Hugo Horton\n| daughters = {{unbulleted list|1 Illegitimate|Alice Horton <small>(in-law)</small>}}\n| grandsons = 4 grandsons\n| granddaughters = {{unbulleted list|Geraldine Horton|5 others}}\n| aunts =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| occupation = Councillor\n}}\nCouncillor '''David Francis Matthew Horton [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]]''', [[Master's degree|MA]] ([[University of Cambridge|Cantab]]), [[Fellowship of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]], born on September 3 (year unknown), chairman of the Parish Council, gentleman farmer, pillar of the community, District Councillor for Dibley and Whitworth. He is the main opponent of the vicar, yet as the series progresses, he comes to respect her. A notorious town bully, he controlled the Council without any opposition until the Vicar's arrival, and is consequently disliked by many, being rigid, old-fashioned, efficient, callous and punctual, yet as the show progresses, becomes lovable and endearing. Apart from the vicar, he is the only sane person in the village. Despite regularly complaining about the council, he has never missed a meeting. In fact, in one episode Jim and Owen reminisce about when David's wife went into labour with Hugo, and David held the meeting in the maternity ward. His wife left him prior to the show's beginning due to his obnoxious nature (although he mistakenly believes she left him because he was a bad cook.) In later episodes of the series, Horton comes to fall for the Vicar and even proposes to her (she accepts his proposal but later decides to back out). He is initially a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]], but defects to the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in 2000 as part of his attempt to persuade Geraldine to marry him, though by the 2004 episode \"Happy New Year\" he is a Conservative Party supporter again. His love for the vicar, however, is steadfast and true. He later supported the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign. He is a multi-millionaire. Hugo mentions that people used to call him \"Dirty Dave\" due to his collection of Victorian pornography. David was an unloving father to Hugo, and even threatened to disinherit him if he married Alice, whom David detests. However he changed his mind and later admitted to the Vicar that Alice and Hugo are happy together.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Alice Horton ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Alice Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Emma Chambers]]\n| years= 1994\u20132011\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = {{unbulleted list|\"Wife Swap\"|<small>(Comic Relief 2007)</small>}}\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother = Mrs Tinker\n| sisters = Mary Tinker\n| husband = Hugo Horton (1998\u2014)\n| sons = At least 4 sons\n| daughters = Geraldine Horton <br> 5 others\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| occupation = Verger, nursery assistant\n}}\n'''Alice Springs Horton''' (n\u00e9e '''Tinker''') is the [[verger]] at the church. Blonde and scatterbrained (Geraldine describes her as having \"the intellectual capacity and charisma of a [[cactus]]\"), Alice is the only main character who does not sit on the parish council, although she did in the episode \"Autumn.\" She is the product of a one-night stand between her [[insanity|mad]] mother (who in the last two episodes is said to be in a mental home) and the cousin of David Horton's father (present-day David Horton's first cousin once removed and predecessor on the parish council), also called David Horton. She and Hugo, her second cousin once removed, are fond of each other and the vicar plays [[Cupid]] successfully in one episode. They eventually marry and have ten children - the eldest, Geraldine, was born on 24 December 1999, in the middle of the village nativity play in which her parents were playing Mary and Joseph. Featuring in the closing credits for most episodes, Geraldine and Alice have a cup of tea while Geraldine tries to tell Alice a joke (frequently the joke is slightly off-colour). Alice rarely understands the jokes that Geraldine tells her and usually proceeds to over-analyse the humour thereby completely killing the joke. In the final episode Geraldine's new husband Harry Kennedy explains the grammar involved and Alice finally understands it. Alice believes in the [[Easter Bunny]], [[Father Christmas]] and the [[tooth fairy]]. After reading ''[[The Da Vinci Code]]'' she believes herself to be descended from [[Jesus]]. She is dim-witted and naive but also sweet-natured and very endearing. She has many misconceptions, such as mistaking [[Black Sabbath]] for gospel singers, telling David that Jesus was one of [[The Carpenters]] and referring to [[Albert Einstein]] as Andrew Einstein. Alice is a fan of the [[Wombles]] and of the [[Teletubbies]]. In episode 12, January 22, 1998, when Alice gets married to Hugo Horton, her bridesmaids are La-La and Po, who hold the wedding-dress train of Alice.\nAs a child Alice had a series of budgies named Carrot and, until Geraldine reveals that each Carrot was a separate budgie entirely, Alice believed that her first budgie Carrot was reincarnated, \"Just like Jesus, but with feathers\". Alice also has a sister, Mary, who is older than Alice but is even more dim-witted. Alice's mother is often described as insane by Geraldine, and there is considerable confusion regarding Alice's father. Although she states that her father (revealed to be a philanderer) is dead, she later names David Horton, the cousin of the councillor David Horton's father as her biological father, but she often claims not to know who her father really was.\n\nA rabid fan of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', Alice unsuccessfully tries to incorporate themes from the sci-fi show into her wedding, including having a wedding gown \"with lots of hearts on it...and a different [[The Doctor (Doctor Who)|Doctor Who]] in each one.\" However, she ends up with a gown decorated with a massive heart with hers and Hugo's names inside. She succeeds in having a ''Doctor Who'' wedding during Geraldine's own wedding. When Gerry's friends take over wedding preparations, Alice uses her position as maid of honour to dress herself as the [[Tenth Doctor]] and the other bridesmaids as [[Dalek]]s.\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Hugo Horton ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Hugo Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[James Fleet]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013, 2015\n| first= \"The Arrival\"\n| last= ''Comic Relief Sketch 2015''\n| classification= Former; regular\n| born=\n| father= David Horton\n| mother=\n| brothers=\n| sisters= 1 Illegitimate\n| wife= Alice Tinker (1998\u2014)\n| sons= 4 sons\n| daughters= {{unbulleted list|Geraldine Horton|5 others}}\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts=\n| uncles=Simon Horton\n| grandmothers=\n| grandfathers=\n| nephews=\n| occupation = Council member, David Horton's campaign manager\n}}\n'''Hugo Horton''' is David's sweet-natured, friendly yet dim-witted and childlike son; Geraldine once also likens his intellect to a cactus.

Hugo and Alice Tinker are always shown to have tender feelings for each other, but they do not get together as a couple until Geraldine plays Cupid in \"Engagement\". David was never a loving nor affectionate father to Hugo, dominating him and undermining all his dreams and ambitions. In one episode, Geraldine mentions that God is a father much like his own father, and Hugo recalls what his father did to him as a child: shouting, insulting and caning him (although he does mention a time when David pretended to be [[Father Christmas]]). When Geraldine corrects him and says she was referring to a loving, caring father, Hugo believes he had another father. Despite this, Hugo still loves and respects his father but finally stands up to him when it came to marrying Alice, whom David predictably despises. He nicknames Geraldine \"Mrs God\".

In \"Celebrity Vicar\", while trying to get \"crazy anecdotes\" about Geraldine for a journalist with all the details, the newspaper headline asks \"Is this The Most Boring Man in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]?\" Due to his tendency to go on and on when given the opportunity, it is said that five people, including his parents, have died while he was talking, and even his therapist accused him of being boring. He decided to declare his [[homosexuality]] in a radio broadcast to the village (after over 40 years of keeping it secret), but apart from Geraldine, who was with Frank at the time, none of the villagers listened to his broadcast. The next day, he decides to assert his sexuality more openly by wearing a bright cerise blazer to attend the parish council meeting rather than his usual brown one. Other references in the show suggest that Frank is [[bisexual]], as he also once admitted to fancying [[Margaret Beckett]] as well as fellow councilors Owen Newitt and David Horton; is as affected by the naked model in the Dibley Parish Life Art Class as the others and painted the same model in the landscape class. He also admitted to sleeping with Owen's cousin Sally and it is implied that he fathered one of her three children (the other two being fathered by Jim and Owen). He defines his ideal man as a 25-year-old South American with an interest in Oxfordshire council procedures. \n\n\"He also gives Alice away at her wedding but wears a sign which states that he is not Alice's father and also tries to put a note in the programme that states that he is not Alice's father but is a close family friend and has \"not had sexual relations with Mrs Tinker in any way whatsoever\".\" \n{{Clear}}\n\n== Jim Trott ==\n\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Jim Trott\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Trevor Peacock]]\n| years= 1994\u20132007, 2013, 2015\n| first = \"The Arrival\"\n| last = ''Comic Relief Sketch 2015''\n| classification = Former; regular\n| born =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| brothers =\n| spouse = {{unbulleted list|Duane <small>(?? - ??)</small>|Doris Trott <small>(1955\u2013mid 1990s; widowed/divorced)</small>}}\n| sons =\n| daughters =\n| grandsons =\n| granddaughters =\n| aunts =\n| uncles =\n| grandmothers =\n| grandfathers =\n| nephews =\n| second cousins =\n| occupation = Council member, Farmer\n}}\n'''Jim Trott''' is a parish council member, who has an [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] way of prefacing \"no-no-no-no-no...\" to almost everything he says, in particular \"yes!\" A newspaper in \"Celebrity Vicar\" gives him the headline \"No, No, No, No Brain\".

Earlier in the episode she said she had a \"memory like an elephant that's lost its memory\".\nAfter her death, Jim and Frank referred to her as a redheaded beauty in her youth, along with Owen's father having talked of her often, with various nicknames such as 'Luscious Letitia,' Titillatin' Tish,' and 'always lets you dock your boat in her jetty Letty'. In her youth, she was notoriously promiscuous, with Jim and David both describing her as \"rampant\" and a \"[[nymphomaniac]].\" It has also been suggested that she has a crush on Frank and thinks he has 'nice thighs', as she admitted on her death bed. She was generally seen on the Parish Council [[crochet]]ing.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Occasional characters==\n=== Simon Horton ===\n{{Infobox soap character\n| color =#F0E68C\n| series = The Vicar of Dibley\n| name = Simon Horton\n| image =\n| caption =\n| portrayer = [[Clive Mantle]]\n| years= 1998-99\n| first = \"Love & Marriage\"\n| last = \"Autumn\"\n| classification= Former; occasional\n| born =\n| died =\n| father =\n| mother =\n| brothers = David Horton\n| sisters =\n| wife = ?

They first meet at the drinks party before Alice and Hugo's wedding and later they meet again when Simon comes up for Sunday lunch with David. After many efforts to get rid of several parishioners who come knocking on her door with various requests, including telling Jim Trott and Frank Pickle that 7 down on a crossword is \"Plodipop\", and arranging the four words \"Leave-You-Remorseless-Bastards\" on the [[Scrabble]] board, Geraldine finally manages to join Simon who's waiting patiently in her bedroom, followed by a few weeks of romantic bliss.

His first visitors in Dibley are Geraldine and Alice, who initially intend to make it clear to Harry that he is not welcome in the village, but are won over by his good looks and friendly manner the moment he opens his front door. Over the course of the following days, Harry and Geraldine go on a succession of dates together, which culminate in the two sharing a kiss. Their romance takes a brief knock when Harry's sister Rosie ([[Keeley Hawes]]) visits him in Dibley and Geraldine mistakes her for Harry's romantic partner. However, Harry proposes to Geraldine, who ecstatically agrees to marry him. Their wedding is the focal point of the final regular episode of the series, ''The Vicar in White''.

She was born on Christmas Eve 1999 during Geraldine Granger's nativity play, when Alice and Hugo played Mary and Joseph. She has nine siblings. Her grandfather, David Horton, pities baby Geraldine and her siblings for being born to their simple-minded parents yet it is evident that they adore their daughter. A statue was made of Geraldine, as an infant, on the village green. She appears in the episodes \"Winter\", \"Spring\" and \"Summer\" and again with all nine of her siblings in a Christmas special. In the Christmas special Horton is presented, along with her five sisters, in pink tutus or pink plaid skirts and other accessories such as pink fur ponchoes. She is the only child of Hugo and Alice whose name is mentioned. In the \"Merry Christmas\" episode, when the Horton children are revealed, Geraldine stands in the centre in front of her father (holding her youngest brother) and brothers and stands behind her four sisters and next to her mother (holding the youngest sister). Alice and Hugo had planned on naming their first born \"Vicar\" after the vicar but Geraldine suggests the name \"Geraldine\" instead and this becomes the child's name.\n\nAlice and Hugo's other children only ever appeared as a cameo in the 2004 Christmas Special.  They had 10 children (four sons and six daughters).  As seen in a documentary of the 2004/05 specials DVD release, a scene with Geraldine greeting the children revealing their outrageous names was cut before the show went in front of cameras.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:BBC-related lists|Vicar of Dibley]]\n[[Category:Lists of British sitcom television characters|Vicar of Dibley]]\n[[Category:The Vicar of Dibley|Characters]]\n", "name_user": "Jellysandwich0", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_The_Vicar_of_Dibley_characters"}

The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.<ref name=\"Relf\" />\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.<ref>Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008</ref>\n\n== Life and death ==\n\n===Bone damage===\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus Sue skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of Sue]]\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death\u2014the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013.

The truck arrived at the museum in October 1997. Two new research laboratories funded by McDonald's were created and staffed by Field Museum preparators whose job was to slowly and carefully remove all the rock, or \"matrix\", from the bones. One preparation lab was at the Field Museum itself, the other was at the newly opened [[Disney's Animal Kingdom|Animal Kingdom]] in Disney World in Orlando. Millions of visitors observed the preparation of Sue's bones through glass windows in both labs. Footage of the work was also put on the museum's website. Several of the fossil's bones had never been discovered, so preparators produced models of the missing bones from [[plastic]] to complete the exhibit. The modeled bones were colored in a purplish hue so that visitors could observe which bones were real and which bones were plastic. The preparators also poured molds of each bone. All the molds were sent to a company outside Toronto to be cast in hollow plastic. Field Museum kept one set of disarticulated casts in its research collection. The other sets were incorporated into mounted cast skeletons. One set of the casts was sent to [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] in [[Florida]] to be presented for public display. Two other mounted casts were placed into a traveling tour that was sponsored by the McDonald's Corporation.<ref name=\"Relf\" />\n\nOnce the preparators finished removing the matrix from each bone, it was sent to the museum's photographer who made high-quality photographs. From there, the museum's paleontologists began the study of the skeleton. In addition to photographing and studying each bone, the research staff also arranged for [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scanning]] of select bones. The skull was too large to fit into a medical CT scanner, so [[Boeing]]'s Rocketdyne laboratory in California agreed to let the museum use their CT scanner that was normally used to inspect space shuttle parts.<ref>Lee, William: [http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html Dissecting a Dinosaur Mummy] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215194441/http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/dinosaurs/scanning-a-dino-mummy.html |date=December 15, 2007 }}, Retrieved on January 2, 2008</ref>\n\n== Life and death ==\n\n===Bone damage===\n[[File:Tyrannosaurus Sue skeletal reconstruction.png|thumb|Skeletal reconstruction of Sue]]\n\nClose examination of the bones revealed that Sue was 28 years old at the time of death\u2014the oldest ''T. rex'' known until [[Trix (dinosaur)|Trix]] was found in 2013. A ''[[Nova (American TV series)|Nova]]'' episode said that the death occurred in a seasonal stream bed, which washed away some small bones. During life, this carnivore received several injuries and suffered from numerous pathologies.<ref name=\"Relf\">Relf, Pat. ''A Dinosaur Named Sue: The Story of the Colossal Fossil''. 2000.</ref> An injury to the right shoulder region of Sue resulted in a damaged shoulder blade, a [[Tendon avulsion|torn tendon]] in the right arm due most likely from a struggle with prey, and three broken ribs.<ref name=\"rothschild-2001\">Rothschild, B., Tanke, D.

H., and Carpenter, K., Indiana University Press, p. 331-336.</ref> This damage subsequently healed (though one rib healed into two separate pieces), indicating Sue survived the incident. The left [[fibula]] is twice the diameter of the right one, likely the result of infection. Original reports of this broken bone were contradicted by the CT scans which showed no fracture.\n\nMultiple holes in the front of the skull were originally thought to be either from a bacterial infection or bite marks by some other tyrannosaur. A subsequent study found these to be areas of parasitic infection instead, possibly from an infestation of an ancestral form of ''[[Trichomonas gallinae]]'', a protozoan parasite that infests birds and ultimately leads to death by starvation due to internal swelling of the neck.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Wolff|first1=EDS|last2=Salisbury|first2=SW|last3=Horner|first3=JR|last4=Varricci|first4=DJ|last5=Hansen|first5=Davis Marinus|display-authors=etal|title=Common Avian Infection Plagued the Tyrant Dinosaurs|journal=PLOS One|language=English|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007288|date=September 30, 2009|pmc=2748709|pmid=19789646|volume=4|issue=9|page=e7288}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Johnson |first1=John Jr. |title=Throat infection may have brought down T. rex |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/sep/30/science/sci-dinosaur-parasite30 |work=Los Angeles Times |date=September 30, 2009 |access-date=July 21, 2018}}</ref> Damage to the back end of the skull was interpreted early on as a fatal bite wound. Subsequent study by Field Museum paleontologists found no bite marks. The distortion and breakage seen in some of the bones in the back of the skull was likely caused by post-mortem trampling.

Originally, the Field Museum had plans to incorporate SUE into their preexisting dinosaur exhibit on the second floor, but had little left in their budget to do so after purchasing it.

Constructed in the [[Dravidian architecture|Dravidian style of architecture]], the temple is glorified in the ''[[Divya Prabandha]]'', the early medieval [[Tamil literature|Tamil]] canon of the [[Alvars|Azhwar]] saints from the 6th\u20139th centuries AD. It is one of the 108 ''[[Divyadesam]]'' dedicated to Vishnu, who is worshipped as Madhavaperumal and his consort Lakshmi as Kadalmagal.\n\nIt is one among the eleven ''divyadesams'' of [[Thirunangur tirupathi|Thirunangur Tirupathis]] and is closely associated with [[Thirumangai Alvar]]. The temple is open from 8 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. to 7 p.m and has four daily rituals at various times of the day. The Thirumangai Azhwar Mangalasasana Utsavam celebrated annually during the [[Tamil calendar|Tamil]] month of ''Thai'' is the major festival of the temple during which the festival images of the eleven [[Thirunangur tirupathi|Thirunangur Tirupathis]] are brought on mount designed like [[Garuda]], called Garuda ''[[Vahana]]'', to Thirunangur. The temple follows [[thenkalai]] mode of worship.\n\n==Legend==\n[[File:Thiruthevanarthogai1.jpg|250x250px|thumb|left|Image of the entrance]]\nThe legend of all the eleven temples of Thirunangur are closely associated with each other. As per legend, the Hindu god [[Shiva]] started dancing in fury at this place after the death of his consort [[Uma (goddess)|Uma]] due to the ''[[yagna]]'' (sacrifice) of [[Daksha]]. Each time his lock of hair touched the ground, there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared.

Each time his lock of hair touched the ground, there were eleven other forms of Shiva who appeared.
