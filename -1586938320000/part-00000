As well as being the bass guitarist for Tears For Fears, Smith co-wrote many of the band's songs, sang backing vocals on most of the songs and sang lead vocals on many of the band's hits such as \"[[Mad World]]\", \"[[Pale Shelter]]\", \"[[Change (Tears for Fears song)|Change]]\", \"[[The Way You Are (Tears for Fears song)|The Way You Are]]\" and \"[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]\". Smith possesses a tenor singing voice.\n\nAfter his departure from Tears for Fears in 1991, Smith pursued a solo career and released his debut album ''[[Soul on Board]]'' in 1993. In total, he has released five [[Album#Studio|studio album]]s and one [[Extended play|EP]], and has also dabbled in acting. He reunited with Orzabal, as Tears for Fears, in 2000.\n\n==Musical groups==\n\n===Graduate===\nSmith met [[Roland Orzabal]] when both were teenagers. They first formed a band in their teens, for which Smith taught himself to play bass guitar. They next formed the [[ska]] influenced band [[Graduate (band)|Graduate]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/tears-for-fears-mn0000019892 |title=Tears for Fears \u2013 Music Biography, Credits and Discography |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine}}</ref> who released their only album in 1980 achieving minor success in Europe. Around this time, Smith and Orzabal also became session musicians for the band [[Neon (British band)|Neon]]. Fellow band members included Pete Byrne and Rob Fisher who went on to become the duo [[Naked Eyes]].\n\n===Tears for Fears===\n{{Main|Tears for Fears}}\nAfter Graduate and Neon disbanded, Smith and Orzabal founded [[Tears for Fears]] in 1981. Their debut album, 1983's ''[[The Hurting]]'', reached no.1 in the UK and produced three international hit singles \u2013 \"[[Mad World]]\", \"[[Change (Tears for Fears song)|Change]]\", and \"[[Pale Shelter]]\" \u2013 each with lead vocals performed by Smith.\n\nTheir 1985 album ''[[Songs from the Big Chair]]'' was even more successful, yielding hits including \"[[Everybody Wants to Rule the World]]\" (with Smith again on lead vocals), \"[[Shout (Tears for Fears song)|Shout]],\" and \"[[Head over Heels (Tears for Fears song)|Head Over Heels]]\" (which Smith co-wrote).\n\nThe duo spent the next several years recording their 1989 album ''[[The Seeds of Love]],'' which proved to be another international best-seller. Smith's last single as a lead vocalist with the group (and his only lead vocal track on the album) was \"[[Advice for the Young at Heart]]\". Following another world tour, increasing tensions between himself and Orzabal prompted Smith to leave the band in 1991, and he moved to New York.\n\nIn 2000, routine legal paperwork obligations led to Orzabal and Smith's first conversation in nearly a decade.<ref>Tears for Fears \u2013 iTunes interview. 2004.</ref> The two patched up their differences and, along with Smith's associate Charlton Pettus, began writing a new album \u2013 ''[[Everybody Loves a Happy Ending]]'' \u2013 released in 2004. Prior to this, \"Mad World\" was covered by [[Michael Andrews (musician)|Michael Andrews]] and [[Gary Jules]] for the soundtrack of film ''[[Donnie Darko]]''. It was released as a single and reached no.1 in the UK during Christmas 2003. The single re-ignited interest in the group's earlier work and their 1992 Greatest Hits album was re-released and re-entered the UK Top 10 for several weeks, garnering its second UK platinum disc.\n\n==Solo albums==\n\n===Soul on Board===\n{{Main|Soul on Board}}\nAfter leaving Tears for Fears, Smith released his first solo album, ''[[Soul on Board]]'', in 1993. The album was unsuccessful in the UK, and was not released at all in the U.S. Smith later claimed that he made the album purely to fulfil his record contract with [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]/[[Phonogram Inc.|Phonogram]].\n\n===Mayfield and Aeroplane===\nAfter moving to New York, Smith formed the band Mayfield with guitarist-producer Charlton Pettus and which also featured Russ Irwin & Doug Petty on keyboards, Smith himself on bass and vocals and finally Shawn Pelton on drums. According to Smith, the name of the band was a play on words (Curt is Mayfield) based on the name of the legendary American soul singer [[Curtis Mayfield]]. The band was mostly a live act but did release a self-titled album in 1998, which met with little success.\n\nSmith later released the album ''[[Aeroplane (Curt Smith Album)|Aeroplane]]'' under his own name. In the U.S., this was a six-track [[Extended play|EP]], but in Canada and elsewhere, it was essentially the earlier Mayfield album combined with additional songs from the U.S. EP.\n\nIn October 2011, Smith announced on his website that he will re-release the Mayfield album on 15 November 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curtsmith.bandcamp.com/album/mayfield |title=Mayfield |publisher=curtsmith.bandcamp.com}}</ref> The new release, on his KOOK Media label, will include a bonus version of the song \"Trees\" featuring [[Janice Whaley]].\n\n===Halfway, Pleased===\n{{Main|Halfway, Pleased}}\nDuring 2000, Smith began work on what was to become ''Halfway, Pleased'', but the project was put on hold when he re-established contact with Roland Orzabal again after almost a decade of silence. Their conversations culminated in Tears for Fears reforming for 2004's ''[[Everybody Loves a Happy Ending]]'' which led to a worldwide tour, so it wasn't until 2006 that Smith resumed work on ''Halfway, Pleased''. The semi-autobiographical album explores Smith's relationships with his children, parents and friends.\n\nIn April 2007, French record label XIII Bis Records released ''Halfway, Pleased'' in France. Its 14 tracks included the original version of \"Who You Are\" (which was recorded by Tears for Fears on ''Everybody Loves a Happy Ending''); a live version of \"Snow Hill\" from the 2005 Tears for Fears UK tour; the single version of \"Seven of Sundays\" (also recorded as a duet with French singer SO); and a cover of \"On Ira Tous au Paradis\" (also available on ''A Tribute to Polnareff''). Two music videos were made for \"Seven of Sundays\" \u2013 one as a solo track, and one as the duet with SO.\n\nAll the songs except \"Seven of Sundays\" were co-written by Smith and Charlton Pettus. The solo version of \"Seven of Sundays\" was co-written by Pettus and [[Chesney Hawkes]]; Smith and Sophie Saillet helped adapt the song for the duet version.\n\nSmith finally released the album in the U.S. and the rest of the world in May 2008 via his own KOOK Media label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1046161/tears-for-fears-smith-goes-halfway-solo |title=Tears for Fears' Smith Goes 'Halfway' Solo |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=14 March 2008 |author=Katie Hasty}}</ref> The KOOK release features a slightly different track listing, eliminating the Polnareff tribute and adding two new acoustic tracks (\"Coming Out\" and \"Seven of Sundays\").

In January 2009, he announced that he will perform a weekly residency at The Standard Hollywood in West Hollywood, CA during the month of February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsAUj9iBWFA |title=Curt Smith/Tears for Fears - Interview part 1 (Creative Commons) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=10 March 2009}}</ref> He announced in mid-February that The Standard had asked him to extend through March 2009 and he agreed. He played a similar residency there in October 2008.\n\n===Deceptively Heavy===\nSmith's fourth solo album was released on 16 July 2013.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/deceptively-heavy/id669439338 |title=iTunes Preview - Deceptively Heavy - Curt Smith |publisher=[[iTunes]] |date=16 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n===\"The Social Media Project\"===\nIn January 2010, Smith released the standalone single \"All Is Love\" (featuring [[Zo\u00eb Keating]]), the first track in what he says will be an album-length project of collaborations with artists he meets via social media.<ref name=\"mashable1\">{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/02/23/curt-smith-interview/ |title=Tears for Fears' Curt Smith Talks Twitter and Solo Career [INTERVIEW&#93; |publisher=[[Mashable]] |author=Barb Dybwad |date=23 February 2010}}</ref> Smith met Keating, an avant-garde cellist, via Twitter.

As of January 2012 Smith's site lacks any specific details but claims \"More tracks coming in 2011!\".\n\n==Collaborations==\nSmith occasionally collaborates with other artists. He worked with the French singer So (Sophie Saillet) providing vocals on her track \"Les Autres\", and the pair worked together again on Smith's track \"Seven of Sundays\" (Saillet also appeared in both videos for the song). Smith is also featured on [[The Shadow Bureau]]'s 2011 track \"Don't Give Yourself Away\" with artist [[Linda Strawberry]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundiron.com/products/voice-of-gaia-strawberry |title=Voice of Gaia: Strawberry |publisher=soundiron.com}}</ref> inspired by the 2010 Australian film ''[[Griff the Invisible]]''.

The band was mostly a live act but did release a self-titled album in 1998, which met with little success.\n\nSmith later released the album ''[[Aeroplane (Curt Smith Album)|Aeroplane]]'' under his own name. In the U.S., this was a six-track [[Extended play|EP]], but in Canada and elsewhere, it was essentially the earlier Mayfield album combined with additional songs from the U.S. EP.\n\nIn October 2011, Smith announced on his website that he will re-release the Mayfield album on 15 November 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://curtsmith.bandcamp.com/album/mayfield |title=Mayfield |publisher=curtsmith.bandcamp.com}}</ref> The new release, on his KOOK Media label, will include a bonus version of the song \"Trees\" featuring [[Janice Whaley]].\n\n===Halfway, Pleased===\n{{Main|Halfway, Pleased}}\nDuring 2000, Smith began work on what was to become ''Halfway, Pleased'', but the project was put on hold when he re-established contact with Roland Orzabal again after almost a decade of silence. Their conversations culminated in Tears for Fears reforming for 2004's ''[[Everybody Loves a Happy Ending]]'' which led to a worldwide tour, so it wasn't until 2006 that Smith resumed work on ''Halfway, Pleased''. The semi-autobiographical album explores Smith's relationships with his children, parents and friends.\n\nIn April 2007, French record label XIII Bis Records released ''Halfway, Pleased'' in France. Its 14 tracks included the original version of \"Who You Are\" (which was recorded by Tears for Fears on ''Everybody Loves a Happy Ending''); a live version of \"Snow Hill\" from the 2005 Tears for Fears UK tour; the single version of \"Seven of Sundays\" (also recorded as a duet with French singer SO); and a cover of \"On Ira Tous au Paradis\" (also available on ''A Tribute to Polnareff''). Two music videos were made for \"Seven of Sundays\" \u2013 one as a solo track, and one as the duet with SO.\n\nAll the songs except \"Seven of Sundays\" were co-written by Smith and Charlton Pettus. The solo version of \"Seven of Sundays\" was co-written by Pettus and [[Chesney Hawkes]]; Smith and Sophie Saillet helped adapt the song for the duet version.\n\nSmith finally released the album in the U.S. and the rest of the world in May 2008 via his own KOOK Media label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/1046161/tears-for-fears-smith-goes-halfway-solo |title=Tears for Fears' Smith Goes 'Halfway' Solo |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=14 March 2008 |author=Katie Hasty}}</ref> The KOOK release features a slightly different track listing, eliminating the Polnareff tribute and adding two new acoustic tracks (\"Coming Out\" and \"Seven of Sundays\").

In January 2009, he announced that he will perform a weekly residency at The Standard Hollywood in West Hollywood, CA during the month of February 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HsAUj9iBWFA |title=Curt Smith/Tears for Fears - Interview part 1 (Creative Commons) |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=10 March 2009}}</ref> He announced in mid-February that The Standard had asked him to extend through March 2009 and he agreed.

He worked with the French singer So (Sophie Saillet) providing vocals on her track \"Les Autres\", and the pair worked together again on Smith's track \"Seven of Sundays\" (Saillet also appeared in both videos for the song). Smith is also featured on [[The Shadow Bureau]]'s 2011 track \"Don't Give Yourself Away\" with artist [[Linda Strawberry]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soundiron.com/products/voice-of-gaia-strawberry |title=Voice of Gaia: Strawberry |publisher=soundiron.com}}</ref> inspired by the 2010 Australian film ''[[Griff the Invisible]]''.
