At [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|room temperature and pressure]], another solid form of carbon known as [[graphite]] is the [[Chemical stability|chemically stable]] form, but diamond almost never converts to it.

They are also the reason that [[diamond anvil cell]]s can subject materials to pressures found deep in the Earth.\n\nThe name ''diamond'' is derived from the ancient Greek ''\u1f00\u03b4\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\u03c2'' ''(ad\u00e1mas''), \"proper\", \"unalterable\", \"unbreakable\", \"untamed\", from [[:wiktionary:\u1f00-|\u1f00-]] (a-), \"un-\" + ''\u03b4\u03b1\u03bc\u03ac\u03c9'' (''dam\u00e1\u014d''), \"I overpower\", \"I tame\".<ref>\n{{cite web\n |last=Liddell |first=H.G. |last2=Scott |first2=R.\n |title=Adamas\n |work=A Greek-English Lexicon\n |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3D%231145\n |publisher=[[Perseus Project]]\n}}</ref> Diamonds are thought to have been first recognized and mined in [[India]], where significant [[alluvial deposit]]s of the stone could be found many centuries ago along the rivers [[Penner River|Penner]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Godavari River|Godavari]].
