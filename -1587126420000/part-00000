It was originally released for the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] home console in Japan and North America in 2000, and Europe in 2001. The game was later ported to Windows-based PCs in Europe and Japan in 2003.<ref name=\"gamespotpc\">{{cite web | title=Breath of Fire IV for PC |year=2003 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/breathoffireiv/index.html | accessdate=2007-02-21}}</ref>\n\nJust as in previous games of the series, ''Breath of Fire IV'' follows the adventures of a young man named Ryu, who has the power to transform into powerful [[dragon]]s. The Ryu in this game must team up with several other skilled warriors to combat an awakened immortal [[emperor]] from ascending to godhood and destroying the world of man. Like ''[[Breath of Fire III]]'', the game utilizes a mix of [[dimension|two]] and [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] computer graphics and turn-based battle sequences.<ref name=\"GameSpot\" />\n\n==Gameplay==\n''Breath of Fire IV'' is a traditional role-playing video game with an overhead, [[Isometric projection|isometric]] viewpoint. The game's camera can be manually rotated by the player up to a full 360 degrees in some instances, though unlike ''[[Breath of Fire III]]'' it cannot be tilted up or down. The game environment is rendered in full [[3D computer graphics|3D]], while characters are presented as [[dimension|two-dimensional]] hand-drawn [[sprite (computer graphics)|sprites]]. While moving about the world, players can interact with computer-controlled characters and objects, gain knowledge about the world around them, and gather clues on how to advance the story. Each playable character is given a special \"field skill\" that can be used to destroy obstacles or solve puzzles outside of battles, which occur randomly in hostile areas or dungeons.<ref name=\"RPGamer\">{{cite web | author=McClung, Robert | title=The Legend of the Silent Dragon | year=2001 | work=RPGamer.com | url=http://www.rpgamer.com/games/bof/bof4/reviews/bof4strev1.html | accessdate=2007-02-21 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923103257/http://www.rpgamer.com/games/bof/bof4/reviews/bof4strev1.html | archive-date=2015-09-23 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n[[File:BoFIVScreen.png|left|thumb|200px|A battle sequence]]\nThe \"Master System\" from ''Breath of Fire III'' returns, allowing players to customize each character by having them apprentice under different masters found throughout the world. Under their guidance, these characters may gain new skills and special statistic increases by fulfilling certain tasks, such as participating in a certain number of battles, or finding specific items. The [[fishing]] mini-game common to the rest of the series also returns, along with the village-building Faerie Town feature from the previous title that allows players to construct a special village that opens new features.<ref name=\"citeguide\" />\n\nBattles take place with teams of three characters against any number of enemy opponents. During these combat sequences, the player can choose which characters will perform an action in any order, as well as switch in any available reserve characters from the back row. While positioned in the back row, a character may not participate in battle, but may regain lost [[hit points|health]] or [[magic points|magic]] every combat round, as well as become unaffected by any attacks. Battles end when either all enemies are defeated or all characters in a player's front row are out of health. Each battle yields experience points that go toward earning levels for each character, which in turn grants increased statistics and new skills.<ref name=\"citeguide\" />\n\nNew to ''Breath of Fire IV'' is the Combo System, which allows certain [[magic (fantasy)|spells]] or skills to be cast in a specific order to gain bonus damage or other effects.<ref name=\"GameSpot\" />  Casting two ice spells in sequence, for example, will produce a stronger ice attack, while a fire spell followed by a wind spell will create an explosion-based attack. Combos may also automatically occur in single attacks that have more than one effect.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Characters===\nThe principal characters of ''Breath of Fire IV'' were designed by series artist [[Tatsuya Yoshikawa]], and consist of Ryu and his companions, each with their own individual skills and personality traits carry the story forward. Ryu (voiced by [[Kappei Yamaguchi]]) is an [[amnesia|amnesic]] young man with the mysterious ability to transform into powerful [[dragons]], with his \"other half\" being Fou-Lu (voiced by [[Isshin Chiba]]), the principal [[antagonist]] and founder of the Fou Empire centuries ago with similar abilities, yet a much more malevolent personality.<ref name=\"citeguide\" /> Aiding Ryu on his quest to confront Fou-Lu are several other heroes including Nina (voiced by [[Kyoko Hikami]]), a winged magic-user and the reigning [[princess]] of the Kingdom of Wyndia; Cray (voiced by Isshin Chiba), a burly member of the [[cat]]-like Woren tribe who wields a large wooden post and holds romantic feelings for Nina's sister, Elina; Ershin (Master in the Japanese version,<ref name=\"Master\">{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/newproducts/consumer/bof4/chara/chara05.html |publisher=[[Capcom]] |year=2000 |accessdate=2010-07-07 |title=\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9 \u30aa\u30d6 \u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2 IV\uff0f\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u7d39\u4ecb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616155424/http://www.capcom.co.jp/newproducts/consumer/bof4/chara/chara05.html |archivedate=2010-06-16 }}</ref> voiced by [[Inuko Inuyama]]), an enigmatic robot-like armor who speaks in third-person; Scias (voiced by [[Unsh\u014d Ishizuka]]), a lanky mercenary and swordsman from the [[dog]]-like Grassrunner clan who lives for money; and Ursula (voiced by [[Kumiko Watanabe]]), prideful granddaughter of a military commander with [[kitsune]]-like features and skilled with guns.<ref name=\"citeguide\">{{cite book |year=2000 |author=Capcom |title=Breath of Fire IV North American instruction manual |pages=5\u20136 |publisher=[[Capcom]] |id=SLUS-01324}}</ref>\n[[File:BoFIVCharacters.png|thumb|right|200px|Tatsuya Yoshikawa's character designs for ''Breath of Fire IV'']]\nPrimary supporting characters include Yohm, a [[general officer|general]] from the modern Fou Imperial Army with the ability to summon monsters to his aid who see Fou-Lu as a threat to the world; Rasso, an elitist company commander dispatched to the Eastern Kingdoms to search for Ryu, Fou-Lu's key to obtaining his lost godhood; Yuna, a cruel [[geneticist]] and [[occult]]ist who participates in horrific acts of genetic manipulation with dark magic; and Kahn, a muscle-bound chauvinist and [[comic-relief]] villain who constantly encounters Ryu's party.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book |year=2000 |author1=Shivers, John  |author2=Young, Jason  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Breath of Fire IV Official Strategy Guide |page=10 | publisher=Prima Games |isbn=0-7615-3367-2}}</ref>\n\n===Backstory===\nA long time ago an emperor called Muuru was having problems with the empire which was in a civil war, so he tried to summon a god named \u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30a4\u300carukai\u300d (which was translated as Yorae) to unify the empire through its divinity. The summoning was imperfect, which made the god to be split both in time and bodies. The summoned god was called Fou-lu. After ten years he was able to unify the western continent into the Fou empire. Meanwhile, the western continent was repeatedly attacked by the eastern continent, so Fou-Lu decided to create a bridge that would transport people and things to the other continent. Carrying the ambitions of Muuru, Fou-Lu wanted to unify both continents and cease the war. But due to the imperfect summoning Fou-Lu entered a sleeping state (sealed) and the empire lost its strike on the eastern continent keeping the war in a deadlock. Without Fou-lu's presence the war kept going on for many years of truces and war. Several years later, the second half of the god came into the world, waking up Fou-Lu that was sealed in a long sleep recovering his powers. And so the game begins...<ref>http://www.dragon-tear.net/newnmk/?it=bof/bof4ssmisc.html</ref>\n\n===Story===\nThe story of ''Breath of Fire IV'' begins with a search team consisting of Nina, princess of the Kingdom of Wyndia, and Cray, leader from the plains-dwelling Woren clan. They are heading to the town Synesta for information on the whereabouts of Nina's older sister and Cray's love interest, Elina, who went missing several weeks earlier on a diplomatic mission.<ref>'''Nina''': It all started on the third day after we had left the castle. That morning, we had entered the Great Desert on our sandflyer. We were heading toward the town of Synesta, the last known location of my sister, Elina. {{cite video game|title=Breath of Fire IV |developer=Capcom |publisher=Capcom |date=2000-11-28 |platform=PlayStation }}</ref>  They are soon attacked by a berserk dragon and their sandflier crashes, forcing Nina to go to Sarai for spare parts while Cray guards their ride. Happening upon a crater left when a strange object landed from the sky, Nina confronts a large [[dragon]] who transforms before her eyes into a young man. Remembering nothing other than his name, Ryu, Nina surmises he must have [[amnesia]] and persuades him to help her search for her sister. Meanwhile, across the world in the western Fou Empire, the ancient Emperor Fou-Lu rises from his burial tomb, declaring that it is now his time to regain his throne, as he promised over six centuries ago. He commands one of his Guardian dogs, Won-Qu, to guard the tomb before heading south. In his vulnerable, newly awakened state, he is attacked by Yohm, a general in the modern Fou army who is privy to Fou-Lu's long-prophesied resurrection, and aims to kill him before carrying out his plan.<ref>'''Yohm''': Pardon my presumption, but I believe you are the God Emperor Fou-Lu... Yes? I have been expecting you... Ever since I saw the flames rising from the woods where I had placed my soldiers on watch. (''Breath of Fire IV'')</ref> Fou-Lu is overpowered in the struggle and is struck down into a ravine.\n\nElsewhere, Ryu and Nina run into trouble with a Fou Empire captain named Rasso and cannot get the needed spare parts in the end. While escaping the Fou soldiers, they travel to a town blighted by an evil [[miasma theory|miasma]] known as \"hex\" to get back to Cray, where they meet Ershin, a mysterious robot-like armor who leads them through the poisoned side of town.<ref>'''Ershin''': Incorrect!  Ershin is not odd. Ershin is saying she will guide these two. (''Breath of Fire IV'')</ref>  Re-uniting with Cray, the team makes their way west to gather more information. The story shifts back to Fou-Lu, who has awakened after his ordeal with Yohm and finds himself in the care of a man named Bunyan.<ref>'''Bunyan''': You must be wondering where you are. My name is Bunyan. I live here, in the Zhinga Mountains. I found you a few days ago, collapsed down by the river. I brought you here, and dressed your wounds. (''Breath of Fire IV'')</ref>  After recovering enough, Fou-Lu departs down the mountain only to find Yohm and his soldiers blocking the path. After a struggle, Fou-Lu is forced to flee by transforming into a dragon and flying away, declaring that he must find his \"other half\", Ryu, and re-unite with him before the Empire finds him first. Yohm summons another creature to chase and strike Fou-Lu down. It succeeds and Fou-Lu crashes into the forest below.\n\nBy this time, Ryu and his friends arrive at the border town of Kyojin, where they meet Captain Rasso again who attempts to block them from entering the Causeway's gates. Quickly escaping past the guards in Fou Empire's continent, the team make their way north where they meet Yuna, an Imperial scientist who knows of Elina. He claims that she was here but is no longer. The soldiers then capture and return them to the Eastern Lands with accusations of breaking the pre-war peace treaty by trespassing in their lands. The group is detained in the town of Ludia and Cray is set to stand trial on their behalf. The group tries to help by \"lessening the evidence\" against Cray but to no effect with the judge. With no other choice Ryu, Nina and Ershin break him out of captivity with the help of Scias, a tall, [[dog]]-like mercenary who joins their cause. Determined to clear their names and find Elina, they travel past a swamp and through a volcano to arrive in Wyndia, where after an audience with Nina's father, the [[king]], the group continues west. After seeking the Wind Dragon at the top of an ancient temple and brought to an ancient summoners' village, the group learns of Ryu's heritage, why the Empire is after Ryu, and the danger he would be in should he and Fou-Lu ever meet. They also learn that Ershin is carrying an Endless' spirit named Deis. While the group learns all this, Captain Rasso tracks Ryu to the summoners' village and kills most of the villagers. They then meet Ursula, granddaughter of a high-ranking Fou Empire official, who is against Rasso's savage methods. After attacking the villagers, Captain Rasso pulls out his trump card against Ryu. Ryu goes berserk and incinerates all the soldiers and Rasso and almost kills Ursula too, but Nina manages to calm Ryu down. Before leaving for Kyojin again along the western border, Ursula joins the group to keep an eye on them. Learning that the Causeway broke down after their initial visit, they find that they need a ship in order to proceed with their journey.\n\nHowever, when the gang reaches the western continent, they find it in chaos. Strange, inexplicable things are occurring there, most of them happening in the city of Astana, where the Imperial Headquarters are situated. When they search the Imperial Headquarters, they find it horrifically transformed. When they are unable to pass through a certain obstacle, Elina's voice suddenly rings out, telling them that they cannot pass without first acquiring the Dragonslayer, a sword that is currently in the keeping of Yuna. Tracking Yuna down to a nearby city, Ryu attacks him, forcing him to discard the Dragonslayer. The party returns to Astana, but an atrocity occurs there: unbeknownst to the party, Yuna had the idea of modifying Elina's body and transform her into an artificial Endless but unexpectedly fused her with the Imperial headquarters. Elina has no wish to exist in this form, so she begs Cray to kill her with the Dragonslayer. After an internal debate, he complies, destroying the Imperial Headquarters and dealing a devastating blow to party morale.\n\nAfter regaining their composure, Ryu and his team travel to the Emperor's [[pagoda]] to stop him, and find Ursula's adopted grandfather, General Rhuh, holding off several monsters and A-Tur charging the palace area. Dying in the struggle, Ursula's grandfather tells his daughter to stop Fou-Lu with her new friends, and restore the empire to its former glory. She agrees, and the group makes their way to the palace's inner sanctum, where Ryu personally confronts Fou-Lu and questions his motivation to destroy humanity after they have done so much for him in the past, recalling and comparing their memories.<ref>'''Fou-Lu''': They, the mortals are ignorant and pride animals. They doth lie to one another, injure themselves and their fellows, and they kill each other all around for sport. Their folly is immeasurable. (''Breath of Fire IV'')</ref>  After an intense battle, Fou-Lu finally understands Ryu's defense and merges with Ryu to become the complete Yorae Dragon God, which decides to send the gods back to their own world. Then Ryu rejoins the group as a mortal, and they leave the palace together.\n\nThere is an alternative ending of the story where Fou-Lu absorbs Ryu, making him the dominant half where he then plans to destroy humanity, starting by killing Ryu's friends.\n\nThe manga adaptation, ''Utsurowazaru Mono: Breath Of Fire IV'', gives a third ending with Ryu refusing to fully absorb Fou-Lu as the gods disappear from the world.  While Ryu's friends wait hopefully wait for his return, he and Fou-Lu are wandering the world side by side as mortals, both relearning and experiencing the joys of humanity.\n\n==Development==\n''Breath of Fire IV'' was developed by [[Capcom]] Development Studio 3, which contained many of the same staff members who produced ''[[Breath of Fire III]]'', including director Makoto Ikehara, and character artist Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who provided designs for the game's hand-drawn sprites. In May 1999 industry rumors began speculating that the title would appear on the [[PlayStation 2]] console when Capcom's Yoshiki Okamoto remarking that their next role-playing game would be a \"giant project\" that would make use of the system's network capabilities.<ref name=\"GSPot1\">{{cite web |title=Capcom Announces PlayStation 2 RPG |author=Kennedy, Sam |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=1999-05-06 |accessdate=2010-07-07 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2451259.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B4}}</ref> The following July, however, it was confirmed that the game would instead be heading to the original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], with development having been underway for \"some time\" beforehand, and was officially unveiled in an issue of Japanese ''[[Famitsu|Weekly Famitsu]]'' magazine the same month.<ref name=\"GSpot2\">{{cite web |title=PlayStation Breath of Fire 4 Official |date=1999-07-28 |accessdate=2010-07-07 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2460731.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B9}}</ref> Due to time constraints, some intended features were not included in the final release of the game, including a scenario that would have involved defeating Yuna, an antagonist who otherwise lives in the end.

The [[fishing]] mini-game common to the rest of the series also returns, along with the village-building Faerie Town feature from the previous title that allows players to construct a special village that opens new features.<ref name=\"citeguide\" />\n\nBattles take place with teams of three characters against any number of enemy opponents. During these combat sequences, the player can choose which characters will perform an action in any order, as well as switch in any available reserve characters from the back row. While positioned in the back row, a character may not participate in battle, but may regain lost [[hit points|health]] or [[magic points|magic]] every combat round, as well as become unaffected by any attacks. Battles end when either all enemies are defeated or all characters in a player's front row are out of health. Each battle yields experience points that go toward earning levels for each character, which in turn grants increased statistics and new skills.<ref name=\"citeguide\" />\n\nNew to ''Breath of Fire IV'' is the Combo System, which allows certain [[magic (fantasy)|spells]] or skills to be cast in a specific order to gain bonus damage or other effects.<ref name=\"GameSpot\" />  Casting two ice spells in sequence, for example, will produce a stronger ice attack, while a fire spell followed by a wind spell will create an explosion-based attack. Combos may also automatically occur in single attacks that have more than one effect.<ref name=\"guide\" />\n\n==Plot==\n\n===Characters===\nThe principal characters of ''Breath of Fire IV'' were designed by series artist [[Tatsuya Yoshikawa]], and consist of Ryu and his companions, each with their own individual skills and personality traits carry the story forward. Ryu (voiced by [[Kappei Yamaguchi]]) is an [[amnesia|amnesic]] young man with the mysterious ability to transform into powerful [[dragons]], with his \"other half\" being Fou-Lu (voiced by [[Isshin Chiba]]), the principal [[antagonist]] and founder of the Fou Empire centuries ago with similar abilities, yet a much more malevolent personality.<ref name=\"citeguide\" /> Aiding Ryu on his quest to confront Fou-Lu are several other heroes including Nina (voiced by [[Kyoko Hikami]]), a winged magic-user and the reigning [[princess]] of the Kingdom of Wyndia; Cray (voiced by Isshin Chiba), a burly member of the [[cat]]-like Woren tribe who wields a large wooden post and holds romantic feelings for Nina's sister, Elina; Ershin (Master in the Japanese version,<ref name=\"Master\">{{cite web |url=http://www.capcom.co.jp/newproducts/consumer/bof4/chara/chara05.html |publisher=[[Capcom]] |year=2000 |accessdate=2010-07-07 |title=\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9 \u30aa\u30d6 \u30d5\u30a1\u30a4\u30a2 IV\uff0f\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u7d39\u4ecb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100616155424/http://www.capcom.co.jp/newproducts/consumer/bof4/chara/chara05.html |archivedate=2010-06-16 }}</ref> voiced by [[Inuko Inuyama]]), an enigmatic robot-like armor who speaks in third-person; Scias (voiced by [[Unsh\u014d Ishizuka]]), a lanky mercenary and swordsman from the [[dog]]-like Grassrunner clan who lives for money; and Ursula (voiced by [[Kumiko Watanabe]]), prideful granddaughter of a military commander with [[kitsune]]-like features and skilled with guns.<ref name=\"citeguide\">{{cite book |year=2000 |author=Capcom |title=Breath of Fire IV North American instruction manual |pages=5\u20136 |publisher=[[Capcom]] |id=SLUS-01324}}</ref>\n[[File:BoFIVCharacters.png|thumb|right|200px|Tatsuya Yoshikawa's character designs for ''Breath of Fire IV'']]\nPrimary supporting characters include Yohm, a [[general officer|general]] from the modern Fou Imperial Army with the ability to summon monsters to his aid who see Fou-Lu as a threat to the world; Rasso, an elitist company commander dispatched to the Eastern Kingdoms to search for Ryu, Fou-Lu's key to obtaining his lost godhood; Yuna, a cruel [[geneticist]] and [[occult]]ist who participates in horrific acts of genetic manipulation with dark magic; and Kahn, a muscle-bound chauvinist and [[comic-relief]] villain who constantly encounters Ryu's party.<ref name=\"guide\">{{cite book |year=2000 |author1=Shivers, John  |author2=Young, Jason  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Breath of Fire IV Official Strategy Guide |page=10 | publisher=Prima Games |isbn=0-7615-3367-2}}</ref>\n\n===Backstory===\nA long time ago an emperor called Muuru was having problems with the empire which was in a civil war, so he tried to summon a god named \u30a2\u30eb\u30ab\u30a4\u300carukai\u300d (which was translated as Yorae) to unify the empire through its divinity. The summoning was imperfect, which made the god to be split both in time and bodies. The summoned god was called Fou-lu. After ten years he was able to unify the western continent into the Fou empire. Meanwhile, the western continent was repeatedly attacked by the eastern continent, so Fou-Lu decided to create a bridge that would transport people and things to the other continent. Carrying the ambitions of Muuru, Fou-Lu wanted to unify both continents and cease the war. But due to the imperfect summoning Fou-Lu entered a sleeping state (sealed) and the empire lost its strike on the eastern continent keeping the war in a deadlock. Without Fou-lu's presence the war kept going on for many years of truces and war. Several years later, the second half of the god came into the world, waking up Fou-Lu that was sealed in a long sleep recovering his powers. And so the game begins...<ref>http://www.dragon-tear.net/newnmk/?it=bof/bof4ssmisc.html</ref>\n\n===Story===\nThe story of ''Breath of Fire IV'' begins with a search team consisting of Nina, princess of the Kingdom of Wyndia, and Cray, leader from the plains-dwelling Woren clan. They are heading to the town Synesta for information on the whereabouts of Nina's older sister and Cray's love interest, Elina, who went missing several weeks earlier on a diplomatic mission.<ref>'''Nina''': It all started on the third day after we had left the castle. That morning, we had entered the Great Desert on our sandflyer. We were heading toward the town of Synesta, the last known location of my sister, Elina. {{cite video game|title=Breath of Fire IV |developer=Capcom |publisher=Capcom |date=2000-11-28 |platform=PlayStation }}</ref>  They are soon attacked by a berserk dragon and their sandflier crashes, forcing Nina to go to Sarai for spare parts while Cray guards their ride. Happening upon a crater left when a strange object landed from the sky, Nina confronts a large [[dragon]] who transforms before her eyes into a young man. Remembering nothing other than his name, Ryu, Nina surmises he must have [[amnesia]] and persuades him to help her search for her sister. Meanwhile, across the world in the western Fou Empire, the ancient Emperor Fou-Lu rises from his burial tomb, declaring that it is now his time to regain his throne, as he promised over six centuries ago. He commands one of his Guardian dogs, Won-Qu, to guard the tomb before heading south. In his vulnerable, newly awakened state, he is attacked by Yohm, a general in the modern Fou army who is privy to Fou-Lu's long-prophesied resurrection, and aims to kill him before carrying out his plan.<ref>'''Yohm''': Pardon my presumption, but I believe you are the God Emperor Fou-Lu... Yes? I have been expecting you... Ever since I saw the flames rising from the woods where I had placed my soldiers on watch. (''Breath of Fire IV'')</ref> Fou-Lu is overpowered in the struggle and is struck down into a ravine.\n\nElsewhere, Ryu and Nina run into trouble with a Fou Empire captain named Rasso and cannot get the needed spare parts in the end. While escaping the Fou soldiers, they travel to a town blighted by an evil [[miasma theory|miasma]] known as \"hex\" to get back to Cray, where they meet Ershin, a mysterious robot-like armor who leads them through the poisoned side of town.<ref>'''Ershin''': Incorrect!  Ershin is not odd. Ershin is saying she will guide these two. (''Breath of Fire IV'')</ref>  Re-uniting with Cray, the team makes their way west to gather more information. The story shifts back to Fou-Lu, who has awakened after his ordeal with Yohm and finds himself in the care of a man named Bunyan.<ref>'''Bunyan''': You must be wondering where you are. My name is Bunyan. I live here, in the Zhinga Mountains. I found you a few days ago, collapsed down by the river. I brought you here, and dressed your wounds. (''Breath of Fire IV'')</ref>  After recovering enough, Fou-Lu departs down the mountain only to find Yohm and his soldiers blocking the path. After a struggle, Fou-Lu is forced to flee by transforming into a dragon and flying away, declaring that he must find his \"other half\", Ryu, and re-unite with him before the Empire finds him first. Yohm summons another creature to chase and strike Fou-Lu down. It succeeds and Fou-Lu crashes into the forest below.\n\nBy this time, Ryu and his friends arrive at the border town of Kyojin, where they meet Captain Rasso again who attempts to block them from entering the Causeway's gates. Quickly escaping past the guards in Fou Empire's continent, the team make their way north where they meet Yuna, an Imperial scientist who knows of Elina. He claims that she was here but is no longer. The soldiers then capture and return them to the Eastern Lands with accusations of breaking the pre-war peace treaty by trespassing in their lands. The group is detained in the town of Ludia and Cray is set to stand trial on their behalf. The group tries to help by \"lessening the evidence\" against Cray but to no effect with the judge. With no other choice Ryu, Nina and Ershin break him out of captivity with the help of Scias, a tall, [[dog]]-like mercenary who joins their cause. Determined to clear their names and find Elina, they travel past a swamp and through a volcano to arrive in Wyndia, where after an audience with Nina's father, the [[king]], the group continues west. After seeking the Wind Dragon at the top of an ancient temple and brought to an ancient summoners' village, the group learns of Ryu's heritage, why the Empire is after Ryu, and the danger he would be in should he and Fou-Lu ever meet. They also learn that Ershin is carrying an Endless' spirit named Deis. While the group learns all this, Captain Rasso tracks Ryu to the summoners' village and kills most of the villagers. They then meet Ursula, granddaughter of a high-ranking Fou Empire official, who is against Rasso's savage methods. After attacking the villagers, Captain Rasso pulls out his trump card against Ryu. Ryu goes berserk and incinerates all the soldiers and Rasso and almost kills Ursula too, but Nina manages to calm Ryu down. Before leaving for Kyojin again along the western border, Ursula joins the group to keep an eye on them. Learning that the Causeway broke down after their initial visit, they find that they need a ship in order to proceed with their journey.\n\nHowever, when the gang reaches the western continent, they find it in chaos. Strange, inexplicable things are occurring there, most of them happening in the city of Astana, where the Imperial Headquarters are situated. When they search the Imperial Headquarters, they find it horrifically transformed. When they are unable to pass through a certain obstacle, Elina's voice suddenly rings out, telling them that they cannot pass without first acquiring the Dragonslayer, a sword that is currently in the keeping of Yuna. Tracking Yuna down to a nearby city, Ryu attacks him, forcing him to discard the Dragonslayer. The party returns to Astana, but an atrocity occurs there: unbeknownst to the party, Yuna had the idea of modifying Elina's body and transform her into an artificial Endless but unexpectedly fused her with the Imperial headquarters. Elina has no wish to exist in this form, so she begs Cray to kill her with the Dragonslayer. After an internal debate, he complies, destroying the Imperial Headquarters and dealing a devastating blow to party morale.\n\nAfter regaining their composure, Ryu and his team travel to the Emperor's [[pagoda]] to stop him, and find Ursula's adopted grandfather, General Rhuh, holding off several monsters and A-Tur charging the palace area. Dying in the struggle, Ursula's grandfather tells his daughter to stop Fou-Lu with her new friends, and restore the empire to its former glory. She agrees, and the group makes their way to the palace's inner sanctum, where Ryu personally confronts Fou-Lu and questions his motivation to destroy humanity after they have done so much for him in the past, recalling and comparing their memories.<ref>'''Fou-Lu''': They, the mortals are ignorant and pride animals. They doth lie to one another, injure themselves and their fellows, and they kill each other all around for sport. Their folly is immeasurable. (''Breath of Fire IV'')</ref>  After an intense battle, Fou-Lu finally understands Ryu's defense and merges with Ryu to become the complete Yorae Dragon God, which decides to send the gods back to their own world. Then Ryu rejoins the group as a mortal, and they leave the palace together.\n\nThere is an alternative ending of the story where Fou-Lu absorbs Ryu, making him the dominant half where he then plans to destroy humanity, starting by killing Ryu's friends.\n\nThe manga adaptation, ''Utsurowazaru Mono: Breath Of Fire IV'', gives a third ending with Ryu refusing to fully absorb Fou-Lu as the gods disappear from the world.  While Ryu's friends wait hopefully wait for his return, he and Fou-Lu are wandering the world side by side as mortals, both relearning and experiencing the joys of humanity.\n\n==Development==\n''Breath of Fire IV'' was developed by [[Capcom]] Development Studio 3, which contained many of the same staff members who produced ''[[Breath of Fire III]]'', including director Makoto Ikehara, and character artist Tatsuya Yoshikawa, who provided designs for the game's hand-drawn sprites. In May 1999 industry rumors began speculating that the title would appear on the [[PlayStation 2]] console when Capcom's Yoshiki Okamoto remarking that their next role-playing game would be a \"giant project\" that would make use of the system's network capabilities.<ref name=\"GSPot1\">{{cite web |title=Capcom Announces PlayStation 2 RPG |author=Kennedy, Sam |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |date=1999-05-06 |accessdate=2010-07-07 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2451259.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B4}}</ref> The following July, however, it was confirmed that the game would instead be heading to the original [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]], with development having been underway for \"some time\" beforehand, and was officially unveiled in an issue of Japanese ''[[Famitsu|Weekly Famitsu]]'' magazine the same month.<ref name=\"GSpot2\">{{cite web |title=PlayStation Breath of Fire 4 Official |date=1999-07-28 |accessdate=2010-07-07 |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/2460731.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B9}}</ref> Due to time constraints, some intended features were not included in the final release of the game, including a scenario that would have involved defeating Yuna, an antagonist who otherwise lives in the end.

It is said that then the Aga Khani Shias were organised into a distinct community by Moulvi Ali Baksh himself.(Excerpts as translated from the book Greatness Bygone authored by Ziauddin Ahmed Barni Published by Taleemi Markaz Karachi on 30 July 1961, Page: 342 written on one of 93 great personalities Ali Mohammed Moulvi. The author had not met only 2 of the 93 personalities noted in his book).\n\n===Sunni Khojas===\nSome Khojas follow Sunni Islam. Khoja or khawajas relating to sunni sect of Islam also called as sheikh, especially in west Punjab now in Pakistan.\nIn fact Ismaili preachers have been spreading their beliefs among the local communities, in Punjab Arora, Bhatia, Khatri, Lohana communities accepted Islam through these preachers they are called Khoja or Khoja Sheikh.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== East Africa ===\nFor hundreds of years, Indians and Pakistanis sailed down the coast of [[East Africa]] in their sail ships during the North Eastern [[monsoon]]s. There were young Khojas amongst these early sailors and some of them stayed behind in East Africa and took advantage of opportunities in commerce and trade.\n\nWhile the new land offered limitless opportunities to the Khojas, the new environment and prevailing influences called for a reorientation.\n\nThe Khojas around the 1870s primarily followed Nizari Ismailism. However, a minority rejected the changes of modernity under the guidance of the Imam of that era and revolted. While some were barred from the [[Jama'at Khana]], the Nizari Ismaili place of worship, others abandoned it willingly. Many of these adopted the larger [[Ithna'ashari]] branch of [[Shi'a Islam]] and were aided by scholars from Iran, hence the origination of an Agha (Persian) community in [[Zanzibar]]. Alongside were the Bahranis, Arab Twelver Shi'a from Bahrain, whose inspirations emanated from Kalbe Aly Khan, a minister to Sultan Majid/Bargash. He proved a great influence and helped a minority of Khojas to secede.\n\n[[Zanzibar]] had a prosperous Khoja community and it was quite forthcoming into this secession. In fact, the Kuwwat Jamaat of Zanzibar became the first ever Khoja Twelver Shi'a community (jamaat) in the world in 1882 when the Khojas elsewhere including the South Asia were still facing opposition to establish their separate identity. There were stirring events and emotions were roused as the dissidents fervently built up their mosque. Initially the connection between the two Khoja groups persisted for a while and even a couple of dhegs{{which lang|date=March 2019}} (large pots) used to be dispatched to the Jama'at Khana from the mosque during jaman (feast). Social traditions also prompted the two counterparts to meet each other. Later, partly at the behest of the Nizari Ismaili Imam, restrictions became severe and even family members separated disconnecting ties between each other or the two met in hiding at a secret place.\n\n[[Kenya]] also slowly developed a large Shia community, largely aided by the work of scholars such as [[Khwaja Muhammad Latif Ansari]].\n\n==Notable individuals==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n\n*[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the ''Quaid-I-Azam'', founder of the state of [[Pakistan]]\n* Khaja Nazimuddin\n*[[Azim Premji]], Chairman of [[Wipro]]\n*[[Kabir Barday]], Founder and CEO of [[One Trust]]\n*[[Issa G.

A Short History of the Ismailis: traditions of a Muslim community.</ref>\n\n===Twelver Khojas===\nKhojas who follow [[Twelver]] [[Shia Islam]] and have large communities in [[Pakistan]], [[India]], East Africa, [[North America]] and the [[United Kingdom]].\nMoulvi Ali Baksh who had settled in Mumbai in the mid-late 1800s was a prominent Moulvi with a great respect in Ithna'ashari Khoja (Aga Khani Shia) community. It is said that then the Aga Khani Shias were organised into a distinct community by Moulvi Ali Baksh himself.(Excerpts as translated from the book Greatness Bygone authored by Ziauddin Ahmed Barni Published by Taleemi Markaz Karachi on 30 July 1961, Page: 342 written on one of 93 great personalities Ali Mohammed Moulvi. The author had not met only 2 of the 93 personalities noted in his book).\n\n===Sunni Khojas===\nSome Khojas follow Sunni Islam. Khoja or khawajas relating to sunni sect of Islam also called as sheikh, especially in west Punjab now in Pakistan.\nIn fact Ismaili preachers have been spreading their beliefs among the local communities, in Punjab Arora, Bhatia, Khatri, Lohana communities accepted Islam through these preachers they are called Khoja or Khoja Sheikh.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\n=== East Africa ===\nFor hundreds of years, Indians and Pakistanis sailed down the coast of [[East Africa]] in their sail ships during the North Eastern [[monsoon]]s. There were young Khojas amongst these early sailors and some of them stayed behind in East Africa and took advantage of opportunities in commerce and trade.\n\nWhile the new land offered limitless opportunities to the Khojas, the new environment and prevailing influences called for a reorientation.\n\nThe Khojas around the 1870s primarily followed Nizari Ismailism. However, a minority rejected the changes of modernity under the guidance of the Imam of that era and revolted. While some were barred from the [[Jama'at Khana]], the Nizari Ismaili place of worship, others abandoned it willingly. Many of these adopted the larger [[Ithna'ashari]] branch of [[Shi'a Islam]] and were aided by scholars from Iran, hence the origination of an Agha (Persian) community in [[Zanzibar]]. Alongside were the Bahranis, Arab Twelver Shi'a from Bahrain, whose inspirations emanated from Kalbe Aly Khan, a minister to Sultan Majid/Bargash. He proved a great influence and helped a minority of Khojas to secede.\n\n[[Zanzibar]] had a prosperous Khoja community and it was quite forthcoming into this secession. In fact, the Kuwwat Jamaat of Zanzibar became the first ever Khoja Twelver Shi'a community (jamaat) in the world in 1882 when the Khojas elsewhere including the South Asia were still facing opposition to establish their separate identity. There were stirring events and emotions were roused as the dissidents fervently built up their mosque. Initially the connection between the two Khoja groups persisted for a while and even a couple of dhegs{{which lang|date=March 2019}} (large pots) used to be dispatched to the Jama'at Khana from the mosque during jaman (feast). Social traditions also prompted the two counterparts to meet each other. Later, partly at the behest of the Nizari Ismaili Imam, restrictions became severe and even family members separated disconnecting ties between each other or the two met in hiding at a secret place.\n\n[[Kenya]] also slowly developed a large Shia community, largely aided by the work of scholars such as [[Khwaja Muhammad Latif Ansari]].\n\n==Notable individuals==\n\n{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}\n\n*[[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], the ''Quaid-I-Azam'', founder of the state of [[Pakistan]]\n*[[Azim Premji]], Chairman of [[Wipro]]\n*[[Kabir Barday]], Founder and CEO of [[One Trust]]\n*[[Issa G.

They help the activity of other immune cells by releasing T cell [[cytokines]]. These cells help suppress or regulate immune responses. They are essential in [[B cell]] [[Immunoglobulin class switching|antibody class switching]], in the activation and growth of [[cytotoxic T cell]]s, and in maximizing [[bactericidal]] activity of [[phagocytes]] such as [[macrophages]].\n\nMature T<sub>h</sub> cells express the surface protein [[CD4]] and are referred to as '''CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells'''. Such CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are generally treated as having a pre-defined role as helper T cells within the [[immune system]]. For example, when an [[antigen-presenting cell]] expresses an antigen on [[MHC class II]], a CD4<sup>+</sup> cell will aid those cells through a combination of cell to cell interactions (e.g. [[CD40 (protein)]] and [[CD154|CD40L]]) and through [[cytokines]].\n\n'''[[CD154]]''', also called '''CD40 ligand''' or '''CD40L''', is a cell surface [[protein]] that mediates T cell helper function in a contact-dependent process<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Lederman S, Yellin MJ, Krichevsky A, Belko J, Lee JJ, Chess L | title = Identification of a novel surface protein on activated CD4+ T cells that induces contact-dependent B cell differentiation (help) | journal = The Journal of Experimental Medicine | volume = 175 | issue = 4 | pages = 1091\u2013101 | date = April 1992 | pmid = 1348081 | pmc = 2119166 | doi = 10.1084/jem.175.4.1091 }}</ref> and is a member of the [[Tumor necrosis factors|TNF]] superfamily of molecules.

In the advanced stages of HIV infection, loss of functional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells leads to the symptomatic stage of infection known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]). When HIV is detected early in blood or other bodily fluids, continuous therapy can delay the time at which this fall happens. Therapy can also better manage the course of AIDS if and when it occurs. There are other rare disorders such as [[lymphocytopenia]] which result in the absence or dysfunction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells.

The T cell receptor (TCR) consists of both constant and variable regions. The variable region determines what antigen the T cell can respond to. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have TCRs with an affinity for [[Class II MHC]], and CD4 is involved in determining MHC affinity during maturation in the [[thymus]]. Class II MHC proteins are generally only found on the surface of specialised [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs). Specialised antigen-presenting cells are primarily [[dendritic cells]], [[macrophages]] and [[B cells]], although dendritic cells are the only cell group that expresses MHC Class II constitutively (at all times). Some APCs also bind native (or unprocessed) antigens to their surface, such as [[follicular dendritic cells]], but unprocessed antigens do not interact with T cells and are not involved in their activation. The antigens that bind to MHC proteins are always short [[peptides]], 8-10 amino acids long for MHC Class I, and up to 25 or so for MHC Class II.\n\n=== Recognition (signal 1) ===\n\n[[File:Antigen presentation.svg|thumb|300px|Antigen presentation stimulates na\u00efve CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to respectively become mature [[Cytotoxic T cell|\"cytotoxic\" CD8+ cells]] and \"helper\" CD4+ cells.]]\n\nDuring an immune response, [[Antigen-presenting cell#Professional APCs|professional antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs) [[Endocytosis|endocytose]] foreign material (typically [[bacteria]] or [[virus]]es), which undergoes [[antigen processing|processing]], then travel from the infection site to the [[lymph node]]s. Once at the lymph nodes, the APCs begin to present antigen peptides that are bound to Class II MHC, allowing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that express the specific TCRs against the peptide/MHC complex to activate.\n\nWhen a T<sub>h</sub> cell encounters and recognises the antigen on an APC, the [[T cell receptor|TCR]]-[[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] complex binds strongly to the peptide-MHC complex present on the surface of professional APCs. [[CD4]], a co-receptor of the TCR complex, also binds to a different section of the MHC molecule. These interactions bring these proteins closer together, allowing the [[intracellular]] [[kinase]]s present on the TCR, CD3 and CD4 proteins to activate each other via [[phosphorylation]]. With the assistance of a phosphatase present on the intracellular section of [[CD45]] (common leukocyte antigen), these molecules activate major T<sub>h</sub> cell intracellular pathways. These active pathways are known as Signal 1 of T cell activation, as it is the first and primary pro-activation signal in a T<sub>h</sub> cell. Upon subsequent encounters with a given antigen, [[memory T cells]] are re-activated using the same TCR pathways.\n\nThe binding of the antigen-MHC to the TCR complex and CD4 may also help the APC and the T<sub>h</sub> cell adhere during T<sub>h</sub> cell activation, but the integrin protein [[LFA-1]] on the T cell and [[Intercellular adhesion molecule|ICAM]] on the APC are the primary molecules of adhesion in this cell interaction.\n\nIt is unknown what role the relatively bulky extracellular region of CD45 plays during cell interactions, but CD45 has various isoforms that change in size depending on the T<sub>h</sub> cell's activation and maturation status. For example, CD45 shortens in length following T<sub>h</sub> activation (CD45RA<sup>+</sup> to CD45RO<sup>+</sup>), but whether this change in length influences activation is unknown. It has been proposed that the larger CD45RA+ may decrease the accessibility of the T cell receptor for the antigen-MHC molecule, thereby necessitating an increase in the affinity (and specificity) of the T cell for activation. However, once the activation has occurred, CD45 shortens, allowing easier interactions and activation as an effector T helper cell.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n===Verification (signal 2)===\nHaving received the first TCR/CD3 signal, the na\u00efve T cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as Signal 2. This verification step is a protective measure to ensure that a T cell is responding to a foreign antigen. If this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the T cell presumes that it is auto-reactive. This results in the cell becoming [[anergy|anergic]] (anergy is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of Signal 1). Anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. These cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo [[apoptosis]].\n\nThe second signal involves an interaction between [[CD28]] on the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and the proteins [[CD80]] (B7.1) or [[CD86]] (B7.2) on the professional APCs. Both CD80 and CD86 activate the CD28 receptor. These proteins are also known as [[Co-stimulation|co-stimulatory molecules]].\n\nAlthough the verification stage is necessary for the activation of na\u00efve helper T cells, the importance of this stage is best demonstrated during the similar activation mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. As na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have no true bias towards foreign sources, these T cells must rely on the activation of CD28 for confirmation that they recognise a foreign antigen (as CD80/CD86 is only expressed by active APC's). CD28 plays an important role in decreasing the risk of T cell auto-immunity against host antigens.\n\nOnce the na\u00efve T cell has both pathways activated, the biochemical changes induced by Signal 1 are altered, allowing the cell to activate instead of anergise{{typo help inline|reason=similar to anergies|date=November 2019}}. The second signal is then obsolete; only the first signal is necessary for future activation. This is also true for memory T cells, which is one example of [[Adaptive immune system|learned immunity]]. Faster responses occur upon reinfection because memory T cells have already undergone confirmation and can produce effector cells much sooner.\n\n=== Proliferation ===\nOnce the two-signal activation is complete the T helper cell (T<sub>h</sub>) then allows itself to [[Cell growth|proliferate]]. It achieves this by releasing a potent T cell growth factor called [[interleukin 2]] (IL-2) which acts upon itself in an [[autocrine]] fashion. Activated T cells also produce the alpha sub-unit of the [[IL-2 receptor]] ([[CD25]] or IL-2R), enabling a fully functional receptor that can bind with IL-2, which in turn activates the T cell's proliferation pathways.\n\nThe [[autocrine]] or [[paracrine]] secretion of IL-2 can bind to that same T<sub>h</sub> cell or neighboring T<sub>h</sub>'s via the IL-2R thus driving proliferation and clonal expansion. The T<sub>h</sub> cells receiving both signals of activation and proliferation will then become T<sub>h</sub>0 cells (T helper 0) cell that secrete IL-2, [[interleukin 4|IL-4]] and [[interferon gamma]] (IFN-\u03b3). The T<sub>h</sub>0 cells will then differentiate into T<sub>h</sub>1 or T<sub>h</sub>2 cells depending on [[cytokine]] environment. IFN-\u03b3 drives T<sub>h</sub>1 cell production while [[interleukin 10|IL-10]] and IL-4 inhibit T<sub>h</sub>1 cell production. Conversely, IL-4 drives T<sub>h</sub>2 cell production and IFN-\u03b3 inhibits T<sub>h</sub>2 cells. These cytokines are [[pleiotropic]] and carry out many other functions of the immune response.\n\n== Effector function ==\n\nIn 1991, three groups reported discovering CD154, which is the molecular basis of T cell helper function.

In order to be effective, helper T cells must determine which cytokines will allow the immune system to be most useful or beneficial for the host. Understanding exactly how helper T cells respond to immune challenges is currently of major interest in [[immunology]], because such knowledge may be very useful in the treatment of [[disease]] and in increasing the effectiveness of [[vaccination]].\n\n=== T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model ===\nProliferating helper T cells that develop into effector T cells differentiate into two major subtypes of cells known as T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 cells (also known as Type 1 and Type 2 helper T cells, respectively).\n\nT<sub>h</sub>1 helper cells lead to an increased cell-mediated response, typically against intracellular bacteria and protozoa. They are triggered by the polarising cytokine IL-12 and their effector cytokines are IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2. The main effector cells of T<sub>h</sub>1 immunity are macrophages as well as CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IFN-\u03b3 CD4 T cells. The key T<sub>h</sub>1 transcription factors are STAT4 and T-bet. IFN-\u03b3 secreted by CD4 T cells can activate macrophages to phagocytose and digest intracellular bacteria and protozoa. In addition, IFN-\u03b3 can activate iNOS to produce NOx free radicals to directly kill intracellular bacteria and protozoa.

IFN-gamma also inhibits the production of cytokines such as [[interleukin-4]], an important cytokine associated with the Type 2 response, and thus it also acts to preserve its own response.\n | The Type 2 response promotes its own profile using two different cytokines. [[Interleukin-4]] acts on helper T cells to promote the production of T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines (including itself; it is auto-regulatory), while [[interleukin-10]] (IL-10) inhibits a variety of cytokines including [[interleukin-2]] and [[interferon-gamma|IFN-\u03b3]] in helper T cells and IL-12 in dendritic cells and macrophages. The combined action of these two cytokines suggests that once the T cell has decided to produce these cytokines, that decision is preserved (and also encourages other T cells to do the same).\n|}\n\nWhile we know about the types of cytokine patterns helper T cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided. Various evidence suggests that the type of APC presenting the antigen to the T cell has a major influence on its profile. Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, but our understanding is nowhere near complete.\n\n===T<sub>h</sub>17 helper cells===\n{{Main|T helper 17 cell}}\n[[T helper 17 cell|T<sub>h</sub>17 helper cells]] are a subset of [[T helper cells]] developmentally distinct from T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 lineages producing [[interleukin 17]] (IL-17).\nT<sub>h</sub> cells produce IL-17 which is a pro inflammatory substance. This means it is especially good at fighting extracellular pathogens and fungi.\n\n===TH\u03b1\u03b2 helper cells===\nTH\u03b1\u03b2 helper cells provide the host immunity against viruses. Their differentiation is triggered by IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 or [[Interleukin 10 |IL-10]]. Their key effector cytokine is IL-10. Their main effector cells are [[natural killer cell|NK cells]] as well as CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IL-10 CD4 T cells. The key TH\u03b1\u03b2 transcription factors are STAT1 and STAT3 as well as IRFs. IL-10 from CD4 T cells activate NK cells' [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity|ADCC]] to apoptose virus-infected cells and to induce host as well as viral DNA fragmentation. IFN alpha/beta can suppress transcription to avoid virus replication and transmission. Overactivation of TH\u03b1\u03b2 against autoantigen will cause type 2 antibody-dependent cytotoxic hypersensitivity. [[Myasthenia gravis]] or [[Graves' disease]] belong to this category.<ref name=\"Wanchung Hu2007\">{{Cite thesis\n|degree=Ph.D.\n|first=Wanchung\n|last=Hu\n|title=Microarray analysis of PBMC gene expression profiles after Plasmodium falciparum malarial infection\n|publisher=Johns Hopkins University\n|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Limitations to the T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model ===\nThe interactions between cytokines from the T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model can be more complicated in some animals. For example, the T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokine [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]] inhibits cytokine production of both T<sub>h</sub> subsets in humans. Human IL-10 (hIL-10) suppresses the proliferation and cytokine production of all T cells and the activity of macrophages, but continues to stimulate [[plasma cells]], ensuring that antibody production still occurs. As such, hIL-10 is not believed to truly promote the T<sub>h</sub>2 response in humans, but acts to prevent over-stimulation of helper T cells while still maximising the production of [[antibody|antibodies]].\n\nThere are also other types of T cells that can influence the expression and activation of helper T cells, such as natural [[regulatory T cells]], along with less common cytokine profiles such as the [[T helper 3 cell|T<sub>h</sub>3]] subset of helper T cells. Terms such as \"regulatory\" and \"suppression\" have become ambiguous after the discovery that helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are also capable of regulating (and suppressing) their own responses outside of dedicated regulatory T cells.\n\nOne major difference between regulatory T cells and effector T cells is that regulatory T cells typically serve to modulate and deactivate the immune response, while effector T cell groups usually begin with immune-promoting cytokines and then switch to inhibitory cytokines later in their life cycle. The latter is a feature of T<sub>h</sub>3 cells, which transform into a regulatory subset after its initial activation and cytokine production.\n\nBoth [[regulatory T cells]] and T<sub>h</sub>3 cells produce the cytokine [[TGF \u03b2|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-\u03b2) and IL-10. Both cytokines are inhibitory to helper T cells; TGF-\u03b2 suppresses the activity of most of the immune system. There is evidence to suggest that TGF-\u03b2 may not suppress activated Th2 cells as effectively as it might suppress naive cells, but it is not typically considered a Th2 cytokine.\n\nThe characterisation of another novel T helper subtype, [[T helper 17 cell]]s (T<sub>h</sub>17)<ref name=\"Harrington2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Harrington LE, Hatton RD, Mangan PR, Turner H, Murphy TL, Murphy KM, Weaver CT | title = Interleukin 17-producing CD4+ effector T cells develop via a lineage distinct from the T helper type 1 and 2 lineages | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 1123\u201332 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16200070 | doi = 10.1038/ni1254 }}</ref> has cast further doubt on the basic T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model.

By this mechanism they provide the immune system with \"memory\" against previously encountered pathogens.\n\n== Role in disease ==\nConsidering the diverse and important role helper T cells play in the immune system, it is not surprising that these cells often influence the immune response against disease. They also appear to make occasional mistakes, or generate responses that would be politely considered non-beneficial. In the worst-case scenario, the helper T cell response could lead to a disaster and the fatality of the host. Fortunately this is a very rare occurrence.\n\n=== Antitumor immunity ===\n{{Main|CD4+ T cells and antitumor immunity}}\n\n=== Hypersensitivity ===\nThe immune system must achieve a balance of sensitivity in order to respond to foreign antigens without responding to the antigens of the host itself. When the immune system responds to very low levels of antigen that it usually shouldn't respond to, a [[hypersensitivity]] response occurs. Hypersensitivity is believed to be the cause of [[allergy]] and some [[auto-immune disease]].\n\nHypersensitivity reactions can be divided into four types:\n* [[Type 1 hypersensitivity]] includes common immune disorders such as [[asthma]], [[allergic rhinitis]] (hay fever), [[eczema]], [[urticaria]] (hives) and [[anaphylaxis]]. These reactions all involve [[IgE]] [[antibody|antibodies]], which require a T<sub>h</sub>2 response during helper T cell development. Preventive treatments, such as [[corticosteroids]] and [[montelukast]], focus on suppressing mast cells or other allergic cells; T cells do not play a primary role during the actual inflammatory response. It's important to note that the numeral allocation of hypersensitivity \"types\" does not correlate (and is completely unrelated) to the \"response\" in the T<sub>h</sub> model.\n* [[Type II hypersensitivity|Type 2]] and [[Type 3 hypersensitivity]] both involve complications from auto-immune or low affinity antibodies. In both of these reactions, T cells may play an accomplice role in generating these auto-specific antibodies, although some of these reactions under Type 2 hypersensitivity would be considered normal in a healthy immune system (for example, [[Rhesus factor#Hemolytic disease of the newborn|Rhesus factor reactions]] during child-birth is a normal immune response against child antigens). The understanding of the role of helper T cells in these responses is limited but it is generally thought that T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines would promote such disorders. For example, studies have suggested that [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]] (SLE) and other auto-immune diseases of similar nature can be linked to the production of T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines.\n* [[Type 4 hypersensitivity]], also known as [[Hypersensitivity#Coombs and Gell classification|delayed type hypersensitivity]], are caused via the over-stimulation of immune cells, commonly [[lymphocytes]] and [[macrophages]], resulting in chronic [[inflammation]] and cytokine release. Antibodies do not play a direct role in this allergy type. T cells play an important role in this hypersensitivity, as they activate against the stimulus itself and promote the activation of other cells; particularly macrophages via T<sub>h</sub>1 cytokines.\n\nOther cellular hypersensitivities include [[cytotoxic T cell]] mediated [[auto-immune disease]], and a similar phenomenon; [[transplant rejection]]. Helper T cells are required to fuel the development of these diseases. In order to create sufficient [[Autoimmunity|auto-reactive]] killer T cells, [[interleukin-2]] must be produced, and this is supplied by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can also stimulate cells such as [[natural killer cell]]s and macrophages via cytokines such as [[interferon-gamma]], encouraging these cytotoxic cells to kill host cells in certain circumstances.\n\nThe mechanism that killer T cells use during auto-immunity is almost identical to their response against [[viruses]], and some viruses have been accused of causing auto-immune diseases such as [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes mellitus]]. Cellular auto-immune disease occurs because the host antigen recognition systems fail, and the [[immune system]] believes, by mistake, that a host antigen is foreign. As a result, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells treat the host cell presenting that antigen as infected, and go on to destroy all host cells (or in the case of transplant rejection, transplant organ) that express that antigen.\n\nSome of this section is a simplification. Many auto-immune diseases are more complex. A well-known example is [[rheumatoid arthritis]], where both antibodies and immune cells are known to play a role in the pathology. Generally the immunology of most auto-immune diseases is not well understood.\n\n=== HIV infection ===\nPerhaps the best example of the importance of [[CD4|CD4<sup>+</sup>]] T cells is demonstrated with [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) infection. HIV mainly targets lymphoid CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but can infect other cells that express CD4 such as [[macrophages]] and [[dendritic cells]] (both groups express CD4 at low levels).\n\nIt has been proposed that during the non-symptomatic phase of HIV infection, the virus has a relatively low affinity towards T cells (and has a higher affinity for macrophages), resulting in a slow kill rate of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by the immune system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This is initially compensated for via the production of new helper T cells from the [[thymus]] (originally from the [[bone marrow]]). Once the virus becomes [[HIV#Tropism|lymphotropic]] (or T-tropic) however, it begins to infect CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells far more efficiently (likely due to a change in the [[co-receptor]]s it binds to during infection), and the immune system is overwhelmed. Of note, recent studies suggest that only ~5% of the lymphoid-derived CD4 T cells targeted by HIV are permissive and become productively infected with the virus. More than 95% of the CD4 T cells that die are resting and are unable to support productive infection. These cells undergo abortive infection with HIV.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Doitsh G. | year = 2010 | title = Abortive HIV Infection Mediates CD4 T Cell Depletion and Inflammation in Human Lymphoid Tissue | url = http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(10)01245-6 | journal = Cell | volume =  143| issue = 5| pages = 789\u2013801 | pmid = 21111238 | pmc = 3026834 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.001 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Cell death is triggered when the host cell detects HIV foreign DNA intermediates and initiates a suicidal death pathway in an attempt to protect the host, leading to [[caspase-1]] activation in [[inflammasome]]s, thus causing [[pyroptosis]] (a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death).<ref name=\"Doitsh_2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Doitsh G, Galloway NL, Geng X, Yang Z, Monroe KM, Zepeda O, Hunt PW, Hatano H, Sowinski S, Mu\u00f1oz-Arias I, Greene WC | title = Cell death by pyroptosis drives CD4 T-cell depletion in HIV-1 infection | journal = Nature | volume = 505 | issue = 7484 | pages = 509\u201314 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24356306 | pmc = 4047036 | doi = 10.1038/nature12940 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Monroe KM | year = 2013 | title = IFI16 DNA Sensor Is Required for Death of Lymphoid CD4 T Cells Abortively Infected with HIV | url = | journal = Science | volume =  343| issue = 6169| pages =  428\u201332| doi = 10.1126/science.1243640 | pmid = 24356113 | pmc=3976200|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nAt this point chronic inflammation ensues, and functional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell levels begin to decrease, eventually to a point where the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population is too small to recognize the full range of [[antigen]]s that could potentially be detected.

This decline in killing of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells results in the virus being produced for a longer period (the infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are not killed as quickly), increasing the proliferation of the virus, and accelerating the development of the disease.\n# [[Antibody class switching]] declines significantly once helper T cell function fails. The immune system loses its ability to improve the affinity of their antibodies, and are unable to generate B cells that can produce antibody groups such as [[IgG]] and [[IgA]]. These effects are primarily due to the loss of any helper T cell that can interact with the B lymphocyte correctly. Another symptom of AIDS is the reduction in antibody levels due to a decrease in T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines (and less interactions by helper T cells). All of these complications result in an increased susceptibility to aggressive bacterial infections, especially in areas of the body not accessible by [[IgM]] antibodies.\n\nIf the patient does not respond to (or does not receive) [[Management of HIV/AIDS|HIV treatment]] they will succumb usually to either cancers or infections; the immune system finally reaches a point where it is no longer coordinated or stimulated enough to deal with the disease.\n\nInhibition of CD4 T-cell expansion during HIV infection may occur due to microbial translocation in an IL-10-dependent way. Triggering PD-1 expressed on activated monocytes by its ligand PD-L1, induces IL-10 production which inhibits CD4 T-cell function.<ref>{{cite journal\n |author1=Said E.A. |author2=Dupuy F.P. |author3=Trautmann L. |author4=Zhang Y. |author5=Shi Y. |author6=El-Far M. |author7=Hill B.J. |author8=Noto A. |author9=Ancuta P. |author10=Peretz Y. |author11=Fonseca S.G. |author12=Van Grevenynghe J. |author13=Boulassel M.R. |author14=Bruneau J. |author15=Shoukry N.H. |author16=Routy J.P. |author17=Douek D.C. |author18=Haddad E.K. |author19=Sekaly R.P. | year = 2010\n | title = Programmed death-1-induced interleukin-10 production by monocytes impairs CD4+ T cell activation during HIV infection\n | journal = Nature Medicine\n | volume = 16\n | issue = 4\n | pages = 452\u2013459\n | doi = 10.1038/nm.2106\n | pmid = 20208540\n | pmc=4229134\n}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[CD4+/CD8+ ratio]]\n* [[CD4+ T cells and antitumor immunity]]\n*[[Cytotoxic T cell|CD8+ T cells]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n* {{cite journal |vauthors=Kanno Y, Vahedi G, Hirahara K, Singleton K, O'Shea JJ | year = 2012 | title = Transcriptional and Epigenetic Control of T Helper Cell Specification: Molecular Mechanisms Underlying Commitment and Plasticity | url = | journal = Annual Review of Immunology | volume = 30 | issue = | pages = 707\u2013731 | doi=10.1146/annurev-immunol-020711-075058| pmid = 22224760 | pmc = 3314163 }}\n* In SLE patients, T helper type 1 polarisation is more abundant rather than type 2, where the main cytokine profile are Inf gama from T cells and its consequence interferon alpha high range production by DC .\n\n==External links==\n{{Commonscat}}\n*{{cite web |url= http://www.tcells.org/scientific/helper/ |title= T-cell Group |publisher= [[Cardiff University]] |website= T-Cells }}\n*{{cite journal |title= Dissecting How CD4 T Cells Are Lost During HIV Infection |pmid= 26962940 | doi=10.1016/j.chom.2016.02.012 |pmc=4835240 |volume=19 |issue= 3 |journal=Cell Host Microbe |pages=280\u201391 |vauthors=Doitsh G, Greene WC|year= 2016 }}\n\n{{Lymphocytes}}\n{{Lymphocytic immune system}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:T Helper Cell}}\n[[Category:T cells|Helper]]\n[[Category:Human cells]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Type of T cell that regulates immune responses}}\n{{About|a type of T cell|the professional wrestling tag team|Ang\u00e9lico and Jack Evans}}\nThe '''T helper cells''' ('''T<sub>h</sub> cells'''), also known as '''CD4<sup>+</sup> cells''', are a type of [[T cell]] that play an important role in the [[immune system]], particularly in the [[adaptive immune system]].

In the advanced stages of HIV infection, loss of functional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells leads to the symptomatic stage of infection known as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ([[AIDS]]). When HIV is detected early in blood or other bodily fluids, continuous therapy can delay the time at which this fall happens. Therapy can also better manage the course of AIDS if and when it occurs. There are other rare disorders such as [[lymphocytopenia]] which result in the absence or dysfunction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. These disorders produce similar symptoms, many of which are fatal.\n\n== Activation of naive helper T cells ==\nFollowing [[T cell#T cell development|T cell development]] in the [[thymus]], these cells (termed recent thymic emigrants (RTE)) egress from the thymus and home to secondary lymphoid organs (SLO; [[spleen]] and [[lymph nodes]]).

The T cell receptor (TCR) consists of both constant and variable regions. The variable region determines what antigen the T cell can respond to. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells have TCRs with an affinity for [[Class II MHC]], and CD4 is involved in determining MHC affinity during maturation in the [[thymus]]. Class II MHC proteins are generally only found on the surface of specialised [[antigen-presenting cell]]s (APCs). Specialised antigen-presenting cells are primarily [[dendritic cells]], [[macrophages]] and [[B cells]], although dendritic cells are the only cell group that expresses MHC Class II constitutively (at all times). Some APCs also bind native (or unprocessed) antigens to their surface, such as [[follicular dendritic cells]], but unprocessed antigens do not interact with T cells and are not involved in their activation. The antigens that bind to MHC proteins are always short [[peptides]], 8-10 amino acids long for MHC Class I, and up to 25 or so for MHC Class II.\n\n=== Recognition (signal 1) ===\n\n[[File:Antigen presentation.svg|thumb|300px|Antigen presentation stimulates na\u00efve CD8+ and CD4+ T cells to respectively become mature [[Cytotoxic T cell|\"cytotoxic\" CD8+ cells]] and \"helper\" CD4+ cells.]]\n\nDuring an immune response, [[Antigen-presenting cell#Professional APCs|professional antigen-presenting cells]] (APCs) [[Endocytosis|endocytose]] foreign material (typically [[bacteria]] or [[virus]]es), which undergoes [[antigen processing|processing]], then travel from the infection site to the [[lymph node]]s. Once at the lymph nodes, the APCs begin to present antigen peptides that are bound to Class II MHC, allowing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells that express the specific TCRs against the peptide/MHC complex to activate.\n\nWhen a T<sub>h</sub> cell encounters and recognises the antigen on an APC, the [[T cell receptor|TCR]]-[[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]] complex binds strongly to the peptide-MHC complex present on the surface of professional APCs. [[CD4]], a co-receptor of the TCR complex, also binds to a different section of the MHC molecule. These interactions bring these proteins closer together, allowing the [[intracellular]] [[kinase]]s present on the TCR, CD3 and CD4 proteins to activate each other via [[phosphorylation]]. With the assistance of a phosphatase present on the intracellular section of [[CD45]] (common leukocyte antigen), these molecules activate major T<sub>h</sub> cell intracellular pathways. These active pathways are known as Signal 1 of T cell activation, as it is the first and primary pro-activation signal in a T<sub>h</sub> cell. Upon subsequent encounters with a given antigen, [[memory T cells]] are re-activated using the same TCR pathways.\n\nThe binding of the antigen-MHC to the TCR complex and CD4 may also help the APC and the T<sub>h</sub> cell adhere during T<sub>h</sub> cell activation, but the integrin protein [[LFA-1]] on the T cell and [[Intercellular adhesion molecule|ICAM]] on the APC are the primary molecules of adhesion in this cell interaction.\n\nIt is unknown what role the relatively bulky extracellular region of CD45 plays during cell interactions, but CD45 has various isoforms that change in size depending on the T<sub>h</sub> cell's activation and maturation status. For example, CD45 shortens in length following T<sub>h</sub> activation (CD45RA<sup>+</sup> to CD45RO<sup>+</sup>), but whether this change in length influences activation is unknown. It has been proposed that the larger CD45RA+ may decrease the accessibility of the T cell receptor for the antigen-MHC molecule, thereby necessitating an increase in the affinity (and specificity) of the T cell for activation. However, once the activation has occurred, CD45 shortens, allowing easier interactions and activation as an effector T helper cell.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}}\n\n===Verification (signal 2)===\nHaving received the first TCR/CD3 signal, the na\u00efve T cell must activate a second independent biochemical pathway, known as Signal 2. This verification step is a protective measure to ensure that a T cell is responding to a foreign antigen. If this second signal is not present during initial antigen exposure, the T cell presumes that it is auto-reactive. This results in the cell becoming [[anergy|anergic]] (anergy is generated from the unprotected biochemical changes of Signal 1). Anergic cells will not respond to any antigen in the future, even if both signals are present later on. These cells are generally believed to circulate throughout the body with no value until they undergo [[apoptosis]].\n\nThe second signal involves an interaction between [[CD28]] on the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell and the proteins [[CD80]] (B7.1) or [[CD86]] (B7.2) on the professional APCs. Both CD80 and CD86 activate the CD28 receptor. These proteins are also known as [[Co-stimulation|co-stimulatory molecules]].\n\nAlthough the verification stage is necessary for the activation of na\u00efve helper T cells, the importance of this stage is best demonstrated during the similar activation mechanism of CD8<sup>+</sup> [[cytotoxic T cell]]s. As na\u00efve CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells have no true bias towards foreign sources, these T cells must rely on the activation of CD28 for confirmation that they recognise a foreign antigen (as CD80/CD86 is only expressed by active APC's). CD28 plays an important role in decreasing the risk of T cell auto-immunity against host antigens.\n\nOnce the na\u00efve T cell has both pathways activated, the biochemical changes induced by Signal 1 are altered, allowing the cell to activate instead of anergise{{typo help inline|reason=similar to anergies|date=November 2019}}. The second signal is then obsolete; only the first signal is necessary for future activation. This is also true for memory T cells, which is one example of [[Adaptive immune system|learned immunity]]. Faster responses occur upon reinfection because memory T cells have already undergone confirmation and can produce effector cells much sooner.\n\n=== Proliferation ===\nOnce the two-signal activation is complete the T helper cell (T<sub>h</sub>) then allows itself to [[Cell growth|proliferate]]. It achieves this by releasing a potent T cell growth factor called [[interleukin 2]] (IL-2) which acts upon itself in an [[autocrine]] fashion. Activated T cells also produce the alpha sub-unit of the [[IL-2 receptor]] ([[CD25]] or IL-2R), enabling a fully functional receptor that can bind with IL-2, which in turn activates the T cell's proliferation pathways.\n\nThe [[autocrine]] or [[paracrine]] secretion of IL-2 can bind to that same T<sub>h</sub> cell or neighboring T<sub>h</sub>'s via the IL-2R thus driving proliferation and clonal expansion. The T<sub>h</sub> cells receiving both signals of activation and proliferation will then become T<sub>h</sub>0 cells (T helper 0) cell that secrete IL-2, [[interleukin 4|IL-4]] and [[interferon gamma]] (IFN-\u03b3). The T<sub>h</sub>0 cells will then differentiate into T<sub>h</sub>1 or T<sub>h</sub>2 cells depending on [[cytokine]] environment. IFN-\u03b3 drives T<sub>h</sub>1 cell production while [[interleukin 10|IL-10]] and IL-4 inhibit T<sub>h</sub>1 cell production. Conversely, IL-4 drives T<sub>h</sub>2 cell production and IFN-\u03b3 inhibits T<sub>h</sub>2 cells. These cytokines are [[pleiotropic]] and carry out many other functions of the immune response.\n\n== Effector function ==\n\nIn 1991, three groups reported discovering CD154, which is the molecular basis of T cell helper function.

In order to be effective, helper T cells must determine which cytokines will allow the immune system to be most useful or beneficial for the host. Understanding exactly how helper T cells respond to immune challenges is currently of major interest in [[immunology]], because such knowledge may be very useful in the treatment of [[disease]] and in increasing the effectiveness of [[vaccination]].\n\n=== T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model ===\nProliferating helper T cells that develop into effector T cells differentiate into two major subtypes of cells known as T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 cells (also known as Type 1 and Type 2 helper T cells, respectively).\n\nT<sub>h</sub>1 helper cells lead to an increased cell-mediated response, typically against intracellular bacteria and protozoa.

IFN-gamma also inhibits the production of cytokines such as [[interleukin-4]], an important cytokine associated with the Type 2 response, and thus it also acts to preserve its own response.\n | The Type 2 response promotes its own profile using two different cytokines. [[Interleukin-4]] acts on helper T cells to promote the production of T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines (including itself; it is auto-regulatory), while [[interleukin-10]] (IL-10) inhibits a variety of cytokines including [[interleukin-2]] and [[interferon-gamma|IFN-\u03b3]] in helper T cells and IL-12 in dendritic cells and macrophages. The combined action of these two cytokines suggests that once the T cell has decided to produce these cytokines, that decision is preserved (and also encourages other T cells to do the same).\n|}\n\nWhile we know about the types of cytokine patterns helper T cells tend to produce, we understand less about how the patterns themselves are decided. Various evidence suggests that the type of APC presenting the antigen to the T cell has a major influence on its profile. Other evidence suggests that the concentration of antigen presented to the T cell during primary activation influences its choice. The presence of some cytokines (such as the ones mentioned above) will also influence the response that will eventually be generated, but our understanding is nowhere near complete.\n\n===T<sub>h</sub>17 helper cells===\n{{Main|T helper 17 cell}}\n[[T helper 17 cell|T<sub>h</sub>17 helper cells]] are a subset of [[T helper cells]] developmentally distinct from T<sub>h</sub>1 and T<sub>h</sub>2 lineages producing [[interleukin 17]] (IL-17).\nT<sub>h</sub> cells produce IL-17 which is a pro inflammatory substance. This means it is especially good at fighting extracellular pathogens and fungi.\n\n===TH\u03b1\u03b2 helper cells===\nTH\u03b1\u03b2 helper cells provide the host immunity against viruses. Their differentiation is triggered by IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 or [[Interleukin 10 |IL-10]]. Their key effector cytokine is IL-10. Their main effector cells are [[natural killer cell|NK cells]] as well as CD8 T cells, IgG B cells, and IL-10 CD4 T cells. The key TH\u03b1\u03b2 transcription factors are STAT1 and STAT3 as well as IRFs. IL-10 from CD4 T cells activate NK cells' [[antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity|ADCC]] to apoptose virus-infected cells and to induce host as well as viral DNA fragmentation. IFN alpha/beta can suppress transcription to avoid virus replication and transmission. Overactivation of TH\u03b1\u03b2 against autoantigen will cause type 2 antibody-dependent cytotoxic hypersensitivity. [[Myasthenia gravis]] or [[Graves' disease]] belong to this category.<ref name=\"Wanchung Hu2007\">{{Cite thesis\n|degree=Ph.D.\n|first=Wanchung\n|last=Hu\n|title=Microarray analysis of PBMC gene expression profiles after Plasmodium falciparum malarial infection\n|publisher=Johns Hopkins University\n|year=2007}}</ref>\n\n=== Limitations to the T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model ===\nThe interactions between cytokines from the T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model can be more complicated in some animals. For example, the T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokine [[Interleukin 10|IL-10]] inhibits cytokine production of both T<sub>h</sub> subsets in humans. Human IL-10 (hIL-10) suppresses the proliferation and cytokine production of all T cells and the activity of macrophages, but continues to stimulate [[plasma cells]], ensuring that antibody production still occurs. As such, hIL-10 is not believed to truly promote the T<sub>h</sub>2 response in humans, but acts to prevent over-stimulation of helper T cells while still maximising the production of [[antibody|antibodies]].\n\nThere are also other types of T cells that can influence the expression and activation of helper T cells, such as natural [[regulatory T cells]], along with less common cytokine profiles such as the [[T helper 3 cell|T<sub>h</sub>3]] subset of helper T cells. Terms such as \"regulatory\" and \"suppression\" have become ambiguous after the discovery that helper CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are also capable of regulating (and suppressing) their own responses outside of dedicated regulatory T cells.\n\nOne major difference between regulatory T cells and effector T cells is that regulatory T cells typically serve to modulate and deactivate the immune response, while effector T cell groups usually begin with immune-promoting cytokines and then switch to inhibitory cytokines later in their life cycle. The latter is a feature of T<sub>h</sub>3 cells, which transform into a regulatory subset after its initial activation and cytokine production.\n\nBoth [[regulatory T cells]] and T<sub>h</sub>3 cells produce the cytokine [[TGF \u03b2|transforming growth factor-beta]] (TGF-\u03b2) and IL-10. Both cytokines are inhibitory to helper T cells; TGF-\u03b2 suppresses the activity of most of the immune system. There is evidence to suggest that TGF-\u03b2 may not suppress activated Th2 cells as effectively as it might suppress naive cells, but it is not typically considered a Th2 cytokine.\n\nThe characterisation of another novel T helper subtype, [[T helper 17 cell]]s (T<sub>h</sub>17)<ref name=\"Harrington2005\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Harrington LE, Hatton RD, Mangan PR, Turner H, Murphy TL, Murphy KM, Weaver CT | title = Interleukin 17-producing CD4+ effector T cells develop via a lineage distinct from the T helper type 1 and 2 lineages | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 6 | issue = 11 | pages = 1123\u201332 | date = November 2005 | pmid = 16200070 | doi = 10.1038/ni1254 }}</ref> has cast further doubt on the basic T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 model.

By this mechanism they provide the immune system with \"memory\" against previously encountered pathogens.\n\n== Role in disease ==\nConsidering the diverse and important role helper T cells play in the immune system, it is not surprising that these cells often influence the immune response against disease. They also appear to make occasional mistakes, or generate responses that would be politely considered non-beneficial. In the worst-case scenario, the helper T cell response could lead to a disaster and the fatality of the host. Fortunately this is a very rare occurrence.\n\n=== Antitumor immunity ===\n{{Main|CD4+ T cells and antitumor immunity}}\n\n=== Hypersensitivity ===\nThe immune system must achieve a balance of sensitivity in order to respond to foreign antigens without responding to the antigens of the host itself. When the immune system responds to very low levels of antigen that it usually shouldn't respond to, a [[hypersensitivity]] response occurs. Hypersensitivity is believed to be the cause of [[allergy]] and some [[auto-immune disease]].\n\nHypersensitivity reactions can be divided into four types:\n* [[Type 1 hypersensitivity]] includes common immune disorders such as [[asthma]], [[allergic rhinitis]] (hay fever), [[eczema]], [[urticaria]] (hives) and [[anaphylaxis]]. These reactions all involve [[IgE]] [[antibody|antibodies]], which require a T<sub>h</sub>2 response during helper T cell development. Preventive treatments, such as [[corticosteroids]] and [[montelukast]], focus on suppressing mast cells or other allergic cells; T cells do not play a primary role during the actual inflammatory response. It's important to note that the numeral allocation of hypersensitivity \"types\" does not correlate (and is completely unrelated) to the \"response\" in the T<sub>h</sub> model.\n* [[Type II hypersensitivity|Type 2]] and [[Type 3 hypersensitivity]] both involve complications from auto-immune or low affinity antibodies. In both of these reactions, T cells may play an accomplice role in generating these auto-specific antibodies, although some of these reactions under Type 2 hypersensitivity would be considered normal in a healthy immune system (for example, [[Rhesus factor#Hemolytic disease of the newborn|Rhesus factor reactions]] during child-birth is a normal immune response against child antigens). The understanding of the role of helper T cells in these responses is limited but it is generally thought that T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines would promote such disorders. For example, studies have suggested that [[Lupus erythematosus|lupus]] (SLE) and other auto-immune diseases of similar nature can be linked to the production of T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines.\n* [[Type 4 hypersensitivity]], also known as [[Hypersensitivity#Coombs and Gell classification|delayed type hypersensitivity]], are caused via the over-stimulation of immune cells, commonly [[lymphocytes]] and [[macrophages]], resulting in chronic [[inflammation]] and cytokine release. Antibodies do not play a direct role in this allergy type. T cells play an important role in this hypersensitivity, as they activate against the stimulus itself and promote the activation of other cells; particularly macrophages via T<sub>h</sub>1 cytokines.\n\nOther cellular hypersensitivities include [[cytotoxic T cell]] mediated [[auto-immune disease]], and a similar phenomenon; [[transplant rejection]]. Helper T cells are required to fuel the development of these diseases. In order to create sufficient [[Autoimmunity|auto-reactive]] killer T cells, [[interleukin-2]] must be produced, and this is supplied by CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells can also stimulate cells such as [[natural killer cell]]s and macrophages via cytokines such as [[interferon-gamma]], encouraging these cytotoxic cells to kill host cells in certain circumstances.\n\nThe mechanism that killer T cells use during auto-immunity is almost identical to their response against [[viruses]], and some viruses have been accused of causing auto-immune diseases such as [[Diabetes mellitus type 1|Type 1 diabetes mellitus]]. Cellular auto-immune disease occurs because the host antigen recognition systems fail, and the [[immune system]] believes, by mistake, that a host antigen is foreign. As a result, the CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells treat the host cell presenting that antigen as infected, and go on to destroy all host cells (or in the case of transplant rejection, transplant organ) that express that antigen.\n\nSome of this section is a simplification. Many auto-immune diseases are more complex. A well-known example is [[rheumatoid arthritis]], where both antibodies and immune cells are known to play a role in the pathology. Generally the immunology of most auto-immune diseases is not well understood.\n\n=== HIV infection ===\nPerhaps the best example of the importance of [[CD4|CD4<sup>+</sup>]] T cells is demonstrated with [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV) infection. HIV mainly targets lymphoid CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, but can infect other cells that express CD4 such as [[macrophages]] and [[dendritic cells]] (both groups express CD4 at low levels).\n\nIt has been proposed that during the non-symptomatic phase of HIV infection, the virus has a relatively low affinity towards T cells (and has a higher affinity for macrophages), resulting in a slow kill rate of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by the immune system.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} This is initially compensated for via the production of new helper T cells from the [[thymus]] (originally from the [[bone marrow]]). Once the virus becomes [[HIV#Tropism|lymphotropic]] (or T-tropic) however, it begins to infect CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells far more efficiently (likely due to a change in the [[co-receptor]]s it binds to during infection), and the immune system is overwhelmed. Of note, recent studies suggest that only ~5% of the lymphoid-derived CD4 T cells targeted by HIV are permissive and become productively infected with the virus. More than 95% of the CD4 T cells that die are resting and are unable to support productive infection. These cells undergo abortive infection with HIV.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Doitsh G. | year = 2010 | title = Abortive HIV Infection Mediates CD4 T Cell Depletion and Inflammation in Human Lymphoid Tissue | url = http://www.cell.com/abstract/S0092-8674(10)01245-6 | journal = Cell | volume =  143| issue = 5| pages = 789\u2013801 | pmid = 21111238 | pmc = 3026834 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2010.11.001 |display-authors=etal}}</ref> Cell death is triggered when the host cell detects HIV foreign DNA intermediates and initiates a suicidal death pathway in an attempt to protect the host, leading to [[caspase-1]] activation in [[inflammasome]]s, thus causing [[pyroptosis]] (a highly inflammatory form of programmed cell death).<ref name=\"Doitsh_2014\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Doitsh G, Galloway NL, Geng X, Yang Z, Monroe KM, Zepeda O, Hunt PW, Hatano H, Sowinski S, Mu\u00f1oz-Arias I, Greene WC | title = Cell death by pyroptosis drives CD4 T-cell depletion in HIV-1 infection | journal = Nature | volume = 505 | issue = 7484 | pages = 509\u201314 | date = January 2014 | pmid = 24356306 | pmc = 4047036 | doi = 10.1038/nature12940 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | author = Monroe KM | year = 2013 | title = IFI16 DNA Sensor Is Required for Death of Lymphoid CD4 T Cells Abortively Infected with HIV | url = | journal = Science | volume =  343| issue = 6169| pages =  428\u201332| doi = 10.1126/science.1243640 | pmid = 24356113 | pmc=3976200|display-authors=etal}}</ref>\n\nAt this point chronic inflammation ensues, and functional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell levels begin to decrease, eventually to a point where the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell population is too small to recognize the full range of [[antigen]]s that could potentially be detected.

This decline in killing of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells results in the virus being produced for a longer period (the infected CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are not killed as quickly), increasing the proliferation of the virus, and accelerating the development of the disease.\n# [[Antibody class switching]] declines significantly once helper T cell function fails. The immune system loses its ability to improve the affinity of their antibodies, and are unable to generate B cells that can produce antibody groups such as [[IgG]] and [[IgA]]. These effects are primarily due to the loss of any helper T cell that can interact with the B lymphocyte correctly. Another symptom of AIDS is the reduction in antibody levels due to a decrease in T<sub>h</sub>2 cytokines (and less interactions by helper T cells). All of these complications result in an increased susceptibility to aggressive bacterial infections, especially in areas of the body not accessible by [[IgM]] antibodies.\n\nIf the patient does not respond to (or does not receive) [[Management of HIV/AIDS|HIV treatment]] they will succumb usually to either cancers or infections; the immune system finally reaches a point where it is no longer coordinated or stimulated enough to deal with the disease.\n\nInhibition of CD4 T-cell expansion during HIV infection may occur due to microbial translocation in an IL-10-dependent way.

As the eldest, Sophie is resigned to a dull future running the family hat shop. Unknown to her, she is able to talk life into objects.This changes however when the powerful Witch of the Waste turns her into an old crone. Sophie leaves the shop and finds work as a cleaning lady for the notorious Wizard Howl. She strikes a bargain with Howl's fire-demon, Calcifer: if she can break the contract between Howl and Calcifer, then Calcifer will return her to her original youthful form. Part of the contract, however, stipulates that neither Howl nor Calcifer can disclose the main clause, leaving Sophie to figure it out on her own.\n\nSophie learns that Howl, a rather self-absorbed and fickle but ultimately good-natured person, spreads malicious rumours about himself to avoid work and responsibility. The door to his castle is actually a portal that opens onto four different places: Market Chipping, the seaside city of Porthaven, the royal capital of Kingsbury and Howl's boyhood home in [[Wales]], where he was named Howell Jenkins. Howl's apprentice Michael Fisher runs most of the day-to-day affairs of Howl's business, while Howl chases his ever-changing paramours.\n\nWhen Prince Justin, the King's younger brother, goes missing while searching for Wizard Suliman, the King orders Howl to find them both and kill the Witch of the Waste. Howl, however, has his own reasons to avoid the Witch; the Witch, a jilted former lover, has laid a dark curse on him. He successfully continues to avoid her until she lures Sophie into a trap. Believing the Witch has taken Howl's current love interest, Miss Angorian, Sophie goes to save her and is captured by the Witch. Howl spends hours in the bathroom everyday primping himself to look handsome for girls; Michael had said that the day he does not do this is the day Michael will believe that Howl is truly in love. So when Howl comes to save Sophie, unshaven and a mess, it proves his love for her. He kills the Witch and reveals that Miss Angorian was actually the Witch's fire demon in disguise; the fire demon had taken control of the Witch and was attempting to create a \"perfect human\" by fusing Wizard Suliman and Prince Justin. It was to be completed by the addition of Howl's head.\n\nAt the castle, Miss Angorian takes hold of Calcifer to capture Howl's heart. Howl had given his heart to Calcifer. This was the contract between them; the heart kept Calcifer alive, and in return Calcifer put his magic at Howl's disposal. Sophie uses her ability of bringing things to life to free Calcifer, thus breaking the contract between him and Howl. With his heart restored, Howl destroys the witch's fire demon, freeing Suliman and Justin. Calcifer, as promised, breaks Sophie's spell and she returns to her proper age. Howl had realized early on that Sophie was under a spell and secretly attempted to remove the curse; when he had met with failure, he'd figured Sophie simply enjoyed \"being in disguise\".\n\nCalcifer returns, preferring to stay with Howl. Sophie and Howl admit they love each other when Howl suggests they live happily ever after.\n\n==Setting==\n\n===Ingary===\nMost of the novel is set in a fictional monarchy, Ingary; its capital is Kingsbury. Much of south-eastern Ingary is harsh wilderness referred to as \"The Waste\". Ingary is bordered by Strangia to the east and the Sultanates of Rashpuht to the south.  Nearby is the country of High Norland; in the middle of the novel, the King of Ingary mentions that Ingary will likely be attacked by both Strangia and High Norland soon.\n\nBefore the move, the castle wanders over the hills between Market Chipping and Upper Folding in the north. Howl's house is in fact based in a seaside town named Porthaven; Howl also occupies a disguised stable in Kingsbury. Chapter Eleven takes place in Wales. After the move, the castle sits at the edge of the Waste and Howl's house is moved to Sophie's childhood home in Market Chipping; they also occupy a grand but derelict mansion in Vale End (which is in the same valley as Market Chipping).\n\n===Howl's moving castle===\nHowl's castle is a tall, black building with four thin black turrets.  It seems to be made of blocks of coal (a suitable habitat for a fire demon) and is \"bespelled to hold together\". It seems to have four doors on the outside, although three are made inaccessible by an invisible wall.\n\nThe inside of the castle is made of the house where Calcifer is based, which is Howl's house in Porthaven at first, then the house by the hat shop in Market Chipping after the move in Chapter Seventeen. A \"square wooden knob above the door, set into the lintel, with a dab of paint on each of its four sides\" allows one to open the door into four different locations. Initially these locations are: the moving castle in the hills above Market Chipping (green); in Porthaven (blue); in Kingsbury (red); and in Wales (black). However, after Howl is forced into hiding he changes the door's destinations to: in Market Chipping (yellow); in Vale End (orange); a garden in the waste (purple); and in Wales (black).\n\nBefore the move, the window over the workbench and the one in Michael's front room overlook Porthaven. Afterwards, the downstairs window looks out on a street in Market Chipping. The one in Howl's bedroom overlooks his sister's garden in Wales.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Sophie Hatter===\n'''Sophie Hatter''', the eldest of the Hatter sisters (18), has red hair and is rather pretty, though she doesn't perceive herself as such. She becomes more lovely as her confidence grows. While her siblings' lives become adventurous and exciting, she finds herself resigned to run her father's old hat shop, as it is her \"fate\" as the oldest sister. One day the Witch of the Waste, mistaking Sophie for Lettie, turns her into an old woman. Sophie leaves the shop and becomes a cleaning lady in Howl's castle, hoping that he might be able to lift the curse placed on her by the Witch. As the story progresses, she starts to fall in love with Howl, though she does her best to deny it. When Howl begins \"courting\" Miss Angorian, Sophie is hurt by this.\n\nThough Sophie is initially reserved and lacking confidence, she demonstrates herself to be a strong-minded individual after she is transformed into an old woman, becoming less afraid of what others think of her.  Dutiful, kind, and considerate, Sophie also has a tendency to be impulsive in her actions and often feels guilty when she does something wrong, though her attempts to rectify matters are usually disastrous. Sophie possesses some magic of her own \u2013 she is capable of making objects come alive by simply talking to them, though she initially is unaware of her abilities.\n\n===Wizard Howl===\n'''Wizard Howl''' (27) is a mysterious, reclusive wizard, with a terrible reputation.  He is known by a number of aliases; by birth, he is Howell Jenkins, but he goes by \"Wizard Jenkin\" in Porthaven and his preferred \"Howl Pendragon\" in Kingsbury. When Howl was young, he gave Calcifer his heart in order for the fire demon to continue living because he felt sorry for him - this is implied to have sapped his humanity somewhat, and will continue to do so till he ends up like the Witch of the Waste.  He is 27 (he states that he will soon be 10,000 days old, which is part of the Witch's curse) and known for being \"wicked\". He comes from Wales, a country unknown to most in the book, where his family remains unaware of his activities in Sophie's world or of its existence; his sister is annoyed by his disappearances, but he often visits them when troubled. He confesses to Sophie that he is a real coward and the only way he can get himself to do something he doesn't want to is to tell himself that he won't do it.\n\nDespite his reputation, Howl is in reality an endearing, charming man who is intelligent, considerate, if somewhat self-appreciative, dishonest, and careless at times. He enjoys \"slithering out\" of uncomfortable situations, often in comical ways. Despite his cowardice, he is an incredibly powerful wizard, capable of matching the Witch of the Waste and is only not known as such because he wants to avoid the work that comes with the respect. His bond with Calcifer increases his powers.\n\nHowl is tall and suave, fond of dyeing his hair, and wearing impressive suits. He spends at least two hours in the bathroom every morning. He is described by Calcifer as \"vain for a plain man with mud-colored hair\". His vanity causes him to throw hysterical fits when Sophie meddles with his clothes or potions. Howl is not naturally handsome, but has \"charm\", both literally and figuratively. He is modelled on the [[Byronic hero]].\n\n===Calcifer===\n'''Calcifer''' is Howl's resident fire demon. As the result of a mysterious bargain with Howl some years ago he agrees to heat and power the castle. Although he is bound to the hearth he has a great amount of magic. He promises to use his magic to break the curse on Sophie, providing she breaks the contract between him and Howl. Howl describes Calcifer as \"his weakest point\", because Calcifer wouldn't give away another demon if it entered the castle, even if it had hostile intentions. However, Howl's statement is true in more ways than one.\n\nCalcifer is powerful, but can be just as cowardly as Howl, preferring to run from the Witch rather than fight her.  However, he, also like Howl, will fight when the need arises.  He is also fairly crabby and a little mean-spirited, which stems from being bound to the hearth in the moving castle for over five years.  He has a natural fear of water, and also worries quite frequently about running out of logs, which are essentially his food.  Sophie seems to be the only one capable of forcing him to do anything he doesn't want to do, a trait she also extends to Howl, and to a lesser extent, Michael as well.\n\nHe is also the first one to recognise Sophie's incredible ability to talk life into the world around her, which is the reason he allowed her into the castle in the first place and was so eager to make a bargain with her \u2013 if anyone but she were to break the contract he had with Howl, then Calcifer would die.  Fortunately, she is able to talk life into him, and he survives losing Howl's heart, even deciding to continue living with them after he is freed. Despite his misgivings, Calcifer is the most perceptive and intelligent character in the Castle, repeatedly dropping clever hints regarding Howl being \"heartless\" (which he uses in literal and figurative meanings), and not hesitating to give clues on Howl's capricious nature.\n\nCalcifer's appearance is described as having a thin blue face, a thin blue nose, curly green flames for hair and eyebrows, a purple flaming mouth, and savage teeth. His eyes are described as orange flames with purple pupils. He does not have any evident lower body.\n\n===The Witch of the Waste===\n'''The Witch of the Waste''' is one of the most powerful magicians in all of Ingary. She was banished by the late King to The Waste fifty years before the story starts for causing havoc in the country. She and Howl had a brief relationship (while she was disguised as a beautiful young woman) which led to him leaving her hurriedly. Angered by this, the Witch cursed Howl, so that after a sequence of unlikely events he would have to return to the Witch. She also puts a spell on Sophie at the start of the story, turning her into an old crone. The Witch is also revealed to have made a supposedly perfect man out of the combined parts of Wizard Suliman and Prince Justin, intending to complete the body with Howl's head and make the man King of Ingary and herself queen. She is killed by Howl at the end of the book.\n\n===Other characters===\n\n*'''Michael Fisher''' is Howl's 15-year-old apprentice.  He originally lived in Porthaven until both his parents died, leaving him an orphan.  He had to leave his house because he couldn't pay the rent and slept on Howl's doorstep. Howl found him there one morning and told him to stay inside whilst he went out. Michael started talking to Calcifer and he believes that Howl was impressed with this when he returned. Howl didn't tell him to stay but he also never told him to leave, so Michael started helping out of his own accord. He eventually became Howl's apprentice, and he does his best to make sure that Howl doesn't spend all their money. He often goes to Cesari's, a bakery in Market Chipping, where he buys pies and other baked goods.  He met Martha there and fell in love with her. Sophie later realises that she saw Michael at Cesari's on May Day before she was cursed by the Witch of the Waste. He's described by Sophie as \"a nice boy, but a bit helpless in a crisis\". He's rather nice and patient but isn't quite as fast-thinking as Howl, therefore making Mrs. Pentstemmon say he was \"not clever enough to cause her concern\".\n*'''Lettie Hatter''' is Sophie's seventeen-year-old sister. She is considered the most beautiful of the three Hatter sisters, and has dark hair and blue eyes.  Initially, she is an apprentice at Cesari's, a pastry shop in Market Chipping, but because she wishes to learn magic, she and Martha switch places using a temporary appearance altering spell.  A strong minded young woman, Lettie becomes fond of a stray dog which is in fact a bespelled Wizard Suliman. When she finds out Sophie has been bespelled and lives in Howl's castle, she sends the dog to protect Sophie from Howl's charm.  Howl tries to woo Lettie, but upon discovering that Lettie is the bespelled Sophie's sister, he begins approaching Lettie to ask questions about Sophie instead. At the end of the novel, she is taken as an apprentice by Ben Sullivan, where a romantic attachment is hinted.\n*'''Martha Hatter''' is Sophie's youngest sister and thought of as the smartest of the three.  She is slender and fair with big grey eyes. Fanny arranges her to become Mrs Fairfax's apprentice, though Martha and Lettie switch appearances temporarily to switch places.  Martha happily works as an apprentice at Cesari's, a renowned pastry shop, and her ambition is to get married and have ten children. She loves Michael Fisher.  When Howl laments that he loves Lettie Hatter, Michael hurries to Cesari's to learn if Martha, still disguised as Lettie, has been courted by Howl.  Martha assures him she has never met Howl and Michael knows she isn't lying because she 'twiddled her thumbs the whole time', and she only stops doing that when she lies.\n*'''Fanny Hatter''' is Mr Hatter's second wife. She used to be the youngest, prettiest shop assistant in the hat shop. She is Martha's mother and is kind to all three girls. When she is widowed, she takes charge of the hat shop and places Lettie and Martha in promising apprenticeships, whilst keeping Sophie to trim hats. Shortly after Sophie disappears, she marries a wealthy man, Mr Sacheverell Smith (possibly thanks to a hat Sophie charmed), moves to a grand mansion in Vale End and sells the hat shop to Howl.  She continues to worry about Sophie, who mysteriously disappeared, and is relieved and happy when they meet again.\n*'''The King of Ingary''' employs Howl to produce transport spells. When the Witch of the Waste threatens his baby daughter Valeria, he sends Suliman the Royal Wizard to the Waste to deal with the Witch. When the King's brother disappears whilst looking for Wizard Suliman, he asks Howl to look for the missing men and get rid of the Witch of the Waste. He then appoints Howl as the Royal Wizard, a move which creates a bad mood in the household of the moving castle.\n*'''Prince Justin''' is the younger brother of the King of Ingary. Unsettled by Suliman's disappearance, he sets off to find him only to go missing himself.  The King of Ingary describes Justin as a brilliant general; with threats of war looming from both Strangia and High Norland, the King of Ingary becomes anxious and insistent that Prince Justin be found.\n*'''Mrs Penstemmon''' is a grand, talented old witch. She taught Mrs Fairfax, Suliman, and finally Howl; she is also mentioned as the teacher of Matilda, the Witch of Montalbino, in ''[[House of Many Ways]]''. She is proud of Howl's talent and wants him to be a good person but she is concerned he is heading the same way as the Witch of the Waste. When Sophie visits her while pretending to be Howl's mother, Mrs Penstemmon encourages Sophie to break the contract between Howl and Calcifer. She detects Sophie's magical gift and sees instantly that she's cursed, but cannot lift the Witch's spell. She is killed by the Witch of the Waste when she refuses to tell the Witch where Howl is.\n*'''Wizard Suliman''' is the Royal Wizard and personal advisor to the King of Ingary. He originally comes, like Howl, from Wales, where he was known as Benjamin Sullivan. He was Mrs Penstemmon's second-to-last pupil.  When the Witch threatens the King of Ingary's young daughter, he is dispatched to the Waste by the King. There he starts growing bushes and flowers in an attempt to reduce her power, but the Witch catches him. He projects most of his magic onto a scarecrow, which Sophie will talk life into. The Witch puts him to pieces and sells off his skull and guitar. She reassembles his body with parts of Prince Justin's (the head in particular) and calls him Gaston. She uses him to find out about Wales to get to Howl, then casts a spell on him that turns him into a dog. Calcifer guesses that one of his aliases is Percival. He takes on Lettie as an apprentice, because he is at least as strong willed as she is.\n*'''Mrs Annabel Fairfax''' is a witch, a former pupil of Mrs Penstemmon's. A widow, she lives in Upper Folding and is a friend of Fanny's. She is \"a plump, comfortable lady, with swathes of butter-coloured hair\". She is chatty and uses home-made honey in her spells.  She discovers quickly that Martha and Lettie have switched places, but accepts Lettie as her apprentice anyway and encourages her to accept Howl's advances and become his pupil, though Lettie eventually chooses Suliman instead. Though she tries, she is unable to lift the curse paced on Percival.{{what|date=February 2019}}.\n*'''Lily Angorian''' is an attractive schoolteacher in Wales who claims to be Benjamin Sullivan's fianc\u00e9e.  As such, she refuses to allow Howl to court her, though Sophie comes to believe that Howl is infatuated with her. She is later revealed to be the Witch of Waste's Fire Demon, and tries to take Howl's heart when the Witch of the Waste is killed. With the destruction of the Witch's heart, she is killed.\n*'''Percival''' is the witch's footman in the beginning, though she calls him \"Gaston\", but she curses him to be a dog. For this reason, he is called \"dog-man\" before his name is revealed. He can briefly turn into a man, but can barely get a few sentences out before turning back into a dog, though a different breed than he was before. In human form he is a nervous red-headed man with a crinkled brown suit. He for a time was with Lettie and Mrs. Fairfax before being sent to Sophie. When he and Lettie later meet they seem to get along swimmingly.\n\n==Major themes==\n''Howl's Moving Castle'' explores several themes, including: destiny, youth, courage and love. The first two are central to Sophie's progression. Early on, her perceived notion of destiny makes her believe that she is doomed to fail because she is the eldest of three sisters. This is in contrast to Howl, who sees himself as the master of his own fate, unafraid of what society thinks of him or what their conventions demand. Sophie's self-perceived failure is reflected in the Witch of the Waste's spell, which causes her outward appearance to become old and dull.\n\n==Allusions and references to other works==\nThe novel makes references to many other works of literature. [[John Donne]] is alluded to twice, first is in Chapter 10 when Howl refers to the first line of [[John Donne]]'s poem \"The Sun Rising\", saying \"Busy old fool, unruly Sophie.\"  Howl makes a reference to Donne again in Chapter 11, when Miss Angorian reads from his poem \"Song: Go and Catch a Falling Star\". The poem also serves as the inspiration for the terms of Howl's curse. In the same chapter there is a sign on Megan's house labelled \"[[Rivendell]]\", the \"Last Homely House\" in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In Chapter 12 there is a reference to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' when Howl tells Sophie \"We can't all be Mad Hatters.\" Howl refers to ''[[Hamlet]]'' in Chapter 17 when he quotes \"Alas, poor Yorick!\" and \"She heard mermaids, so it follows that something is rotten in the state of Denmark. I have an everlasting cold, but luckily I'm terribly dishonest. I cling to that.\"; another ''Hamlet'' reference occurs at the beginning of Chapter 11 referring to the nothingness in the doorway to Wales as being \"only an inch-thick after all\". The names of Suliman's alias [[Percival]], and Howl's brother-in-law [[Gareth]] are two of the [[Knights of the Round Table]], while Howl's own alias, [[Pendragon]], is derived from King Arthur's surname. The [[Witch of the Waste]]'s name is a possible pun on the [[Witch of the West]] from the novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|subsequent film]]. A traditional Welsh folk song, ''[[Sosban Fach]]'', is referred several times in the novel as \"Calcifer's silly saucepan song\".\n\n==Film adaptation==\n{{main|Howl's Moving Castle (film)}}\nThe novel was adapted into a [[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|2004 animated film]], written and directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and produced by [[Studio Ghibli]]. The film was critically acclaimed, broke box office records in Japan, and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nIn 1986 ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was one of two runners-up for the annual [[Boston Globe-Horn Book Award]] in Fiction, behind ''In Summer Light'' by Zibby Oneal.<ref name = bghb/> It was also named one of that year's [[ALA Notable Books for Children]].\n\nJones and Howl won the annual [[Phoenix Award]] from the [[Children's Literature Association]] in 2006, recognising the best children's book published twenty years earlier that did not win a major award. Allusion to the [[Phoenix (mythology)|mythical bird phoenix]], which is reborn from its ashes, suggests the winning book's rise from obscurity.<ref name=phoenix />\n\n==In other media==\n[[A Thousand Times Repent]], a [[Christian metal|Christian]] [[deathcore]] band, took inspiration from ''Howl's Moving Castle'' in their [[Extended Play|EP]] ''[[Virtue Has Few Friends]]''. The song \"Take Me to the Witch of the Waste...

Sophie is able to unknowingly talk life into inanimate objects. As the eldest, she is resigned to a dull future running the family hat shop. This changes however when the powerful Witch of the Waste turns her into an old crone. Sophie leaves the shop and finds work as a cleaning lady for the notorious Wizard Howl. She strikes a bargain with Howl's fire-demon, Calcifer: if she can break the contract between Howl and Calcifer, then Calcifer will return her to her original youthful form. Part of the contract, however, stipulates that neither Howl nor Calcifer can disclose the main clause, leaving Sophie to figure it out on her own.\n\nSophie learns that Howl, a rather self-absorbed and fickle but ultimately good-natured person, spreads malicious rumours about himself to avoid work and responsibility. The door to his castle is actually a portal that opens onto four different places: Market Chipping, the seaside city of Porthaven, the royal capital of Kingsbury and Howl's boyhood home in [[Wales]], where he was named Howell Jenkins. Howl's apprentice Michael Fisher runs most of the day-to-day affairs of Howl's business, while Howl chases his ever-changing paramours.\n\nWhen Prince Justin, the King's younger brother, goes missing while searching for Wizard Suliman, the King orders Howl to find them both and kill the Witch of the Waste. Howl, however, has his own reasons to avoid the Witch; the Witch, a jilted former lover, has laid a dark curse on him. He successfully continues to avoid her until she lures Sophie into a trap. Believing the Witch has taken Howl's current love interest, Miss Angorian, Sophie goes to save her and is captured by the Witch. Howl spends hours in the bathroom everyday primping himself to look handsome for girls; Michael had said that the day he does not do this is the day Michael will believe that Howl is truly in love. So when Howl comes to save Sophie, unshaven and a mess, it proves his love for her. He kills the Witch and reveals that Miss Angorian was actually the Witch's fire demon in disguise; the fire demon had taken control of the Witch and was attempting to create a \"perfect human\" by fusing Wizard Suliman and Prince Justin. It was to be completed by the addition of Howl's head.\n\nAt the castle, Miss Angorian takes hold of Calcifer to capture Howl's heart. Howl had given his heart to Calcifer. This was the contract between them; the heart kept Calcifer alive, and in return Calcifer put his magic at Howl's disposal. Sophie uses her ability of bringing things to life to free Calcifer, thus breaking the contract between him and Howl. With his heart restored, Howl destroys the witch's fire demon, freeing Suliman and Justin. Calcifer, as promised, breaks Sophie's spell and she returns to her proper age. Howl had realized early on that Sophie was under a spell and secretly attempted to remove the curse; when he had met with failure, he'd figured Sophie simply enjoyed \"being in disguise\".\n\nCalcifer returns, preferring to stay with Howl. Sophie and Howl admit they love each other when Howl suggests they live happily ever after.\n\n==Setting==\n\n===Ingary===\nMost of the novel is set in a fictional monarchy, Ingary; its capital is Kingsbury. Much of south-eastern Ingary is harsh wilderness referred to as \"The Waste\". Ingary is bordered by Strangia to the east and the Sultanates of Rashpuht to the south.  Nearby is the country of High Norland; in the middle of the novel, the King of Ingary mentions that Ingary will likely be attacked by both Strangia and High Norland soon.\n\nBefore the move, the castle wanders over the hills between Market Chipping and Upper Folding in the north. Howl's house is in fact based in a seaside town named Porthaven; Howl also occupies a disguised stable in Kingsbury. Chapter Eleven takes place in Wales. After the move, the castle sits at the edge of the Waste and Howl's house is moved to Sophie's childhood home in Market Chipping; they also occupy a grand but derelict mansion in Vale End (which is in the same valley as Market Chipping).\n\n===Howl's moving castle===\nHowl's castle is a tall, black building with four thin black turrets.  It seems to be made of blocks of coal (a suitable habitat for a fire demon) and is \"bespelled to hold together\". It seems to have four doors on the outside, although three are made inaccessible by an invisible wall.\n\nThe inside of the castle is made of the house where Calcifer is based, which is Howl's house in Porthaven at first, then the house by the hat shop in Market Chipping after the move in Chapter Seventeen. A \"square wooden knob above the door, set into the lintel, with a dab of paint on each of its four sides\" allows one to open the door into four different locations. Initially these locations are: the moving castle in the hills above Market Chipping (green); in Porthaven (blue); in Kingsbury (red); and in Wales (black). However, after Howl is forced into hiding he changes the door's destinations to: in Market Chipping (yellow); in Vale End (orange); a garden in the waste (purple); and in Wales (black).\n\nBefore the move, the window over the workbench and the one in Michael's front room overlook Porthaven. Afterwards, the downstairs window looks out on a street in Market Chipping. The one in Howl's bedroom overlooks his sister's garden in Wales.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Sophie Hatter===\n'''Sophie Hatter''', the eldest of the Hatter sisters (18), has red hair and is rather pretty, though she doesn't perceive herself as such. She becomes more lovely as her confidence grows. While her siblings' lives become adventurous and exciting, she finds herself resigned to run her father's old hat shop, as it is her \"fate\" as the oldest sister. One day the Witch of the Waste, mistaking Sophie for Lettie, turns her into an old woman. Sophie leaves the shop and becomes a cleaning lady in Howl's castle, hoping that he might be able to lift the curse placed on her by the Witch. As the story progresses, she starts to fall in love with Howl, though she does her best to deny it. When Howl begins \"courting\" Miss Angorian, Sophie is hurt by this.\n\nThough Sophie is initially reserved and lacking confidence, she demonstrates herself to be a strong-minded individual after she is transformed into an old woman, becoming less afraid of what others think of her.  Dutiful, kind, and considerate, Sophie also has a tendency to be impulsive in her actions and often feels guilty when she does something wrong, though her attempts to rectify matters are usually disastrous. Sophie possesses some magic of her own \u2013 she is capable of making objects come alive by simply talking to them, though she initially is unaware of her abilities.\n\n===Wizard Howl===\n'''Wizard Howl''' (27) is a mysterious, reclusive wizard, with a terrible reputation.  He is known by a number of aliases; by birth, he is Howell Jenkins, but he goes by \"Wizard Jenkin\" in Porthaven and his preferred \"Howl Pendragon\" in Kingsbury. When Howl was young, he gave Calcifer his heart in order for the fire demon to continue living because he felt sorry for him - this is implied to have sapped his humanity somewhat, and will continue to do so till he ends up like the Witch of the Waste.  He is 27 (he states that he will soon be 10,000 days old, which is part of the Witch's curse) and known for being \"wicked\". He comes from Wales, a country unknown to most in the book, where his family remains unaware of his activities in Sophie's world or of its existence; his sister is annoyed by his disappearances, but he often visits them when troubled. He confesses to Sophie that he is a real coward and the only way he can get himself to do something he doesn't want to is to tell himself that he won't do it.\n\nDespite his reputation, Howl is in reality an endearing, charming man who is intelligent, considerate, if somewhat self-appreciative, dishonest, and careless at times. He enjoys \"slithering out\" of uncomfortable situations, often in comical ways. Despite his cowardice, he is an incredibly powerful wizard, capable of matching the Witch of the Waste and is only not known as such because he wants to avoid the work that comes with the respect. His bond with Calcifer increases his powers.\n\nHowl is tall and suave, fond of dyeing his hair, and wearing impressive suits. He spends at least two hours in the bathroom every morning. He is described by Calcifer as \"vain for a plain man with mud-colored hair\". His vanity causes him to throw hysterical fits when Sophie meddles with his clothes or potions. Howl is not naturally handsome, but has \"charm\", both literally and figuratively. He is modelled on the [[Byronic hero]].\n\n===Calcifer===\n'''Calcifer''' is Howl's resident fire demon. As the result of a mysterious bargain with Howl some years ago he agrees to heat and power the castle. Although he is bound to the hearth he has a great amount of magic. He promises to use his magic to break the curse on Sophie, providing she breaks the contract between him and Howl. Howl describes Calcifer as \"his weakest point\", because Calcifer wouldn't give away another demon if it entered the castle, even if it had hostile intentions. However, Howl's statement is true in more ways than one.\n\nCalcifer is powerful, but can be just as cowardly as Howl, preferring to run from the Witch rather than fight her.  However, he, also like Howl, will fight when the need arises.  He is also fairly crabby and a little mean-spirited, which stems from being bound to the hearth in the moving castle for over five years.  He has a natural fear of water, and also worries quite frequently about running out of logs, which are essentially his food.  Sophie seems to be the only one capable of forcing him to do anything he doesn't want to do, a trait she also extends to Howl, and to a lesser extent, Michael as well.\n\nHe is also the first one to recognise Sophie's incredible ability to talk life into the world around her, which is the reason he allowed her into the castle in the first place and was so eager to make a bargain with her \u2013 if anyone but she were to break the contract he had with Howl, then Calcifer would die.  Fortunately, she is able to talk life into him, and he survives losing Howl's heart, even deciding to continue living with them after he is freed. Despite his misgivings, Calcifer is the most perceptive and intelligent character in the Castle, repeatedly dropping clever hints regarding Howl being \"heartless\" (which he uses in literal and figurative meanings), and not hesitating to give clues on Howl's capricious nature.\n\nCalcifer's appearance is described as having a thin blue face, a thin blue nose, curly green flames for hair and eyebrows, a purple flaming mouth, and savage teeth. His eyes are described as orange flames with purple pupils. He does not have any evident lower body.\n\n===The Witch of the Waste===\n'''The Witch of the Waste''' is one of the most powerful magicians in all of Ingary. She was banished by the late King to The Waste fifty years before the story starts for causing havoc in the country. She and Howl had a brief relationship (while she was disguised as a beautiful young woman) which led to him leaving her hurriedly. Angered by this, the Witch cursed Howl, so that after a sequence of unlikely events he would have to return to the Witch. She also puts a spell on Sophie at the start of the story, turning her into an old crone. The Witch is also revealed to have made a supposedly perfect man out of the combined parts of Wizard Suliman and Prince Justin, intending to complete the body with Howl's head and make the man King of Ingary and herself queen. She is killed by Howl at the end of the book.\n\n===Other characters===\n\n*'''Michael Fisher''' is Howl's 15-year-old apprentice.  He originally lived in Porthaven until both his parents died, leaving him an orphan.  He had to leave his house because he couldn't pay the rent and slept on Howl's doorstep. Howl found him there one morning and told him to stay inside whilst he went out. Michael started talking to Calcifer and he believes that Howl was impressed with this when he returned. Howl didn't tell him to stay but he also never told him to leave, so Michael started helping out of his own accord. He eventually became Howl's apprentice, and he does his best to make sure that Howl doesn't spend all their money. He often goes to Cesari's, a bakery in Market Chipping, where he buys pies and other baked goods.  He met Martha there and fell in love with her. Sophie later realises that she saw Michael at Cesari's on May Day before she was cursed by the Witch of the Waste. He's described by Sophie as \"a nice boy, but a bit helpless in a crisis\". He's rather nice and patient but isn't quite as fast-thinking as Howl, therefore making Mrs. Pentstemmon say he was \"not clever enough to cause her concern\".\n*'''Lettie Hatter''' is Sophie's seventeen-year-old sister. She is considered the most beautiful of the three Hatter sisters, and has dark hair and blue eyes.  Initially, she is an apprentice at Cesari's, a pastry shop in Market Chipping, but because she wishes to learn magic, she and Martha switch places using a temporary appearance altering spell.  A strong minded young woman, Lettie becomes fond of a stray dog which is in fact a bespelled Wizard Suliman. When she finds out Sophie has been bespelled and lives in Howl's castle, she sends the dog to protect Sophie from Howl's charm.  Howl tries to woo Lettie, but upon discovering that Lettie is the bespelled Sophie's sister, he begins approaching Lettie to ask questions about Sophie instead. At the end of the novel, she is taken as an apprentice by Ben Sullivan, where a romantic attachment is hinted.\n*'''Martha Hatter''' is Sophie's youngest sister and thought of as the smartest of the three.  She is slender and fair with big grey eyes. Fanny arranges her to become Mrs Fairfax's apprentice, though Martha and Lettie switch appearances temporarily to switch places.  Martha happily works as an apprentice at Cesari's, a renowned pastry shop, and her ambition is to get married and have ten children. She loves Michael Fisher.  When Howl laments that he loves Lettie Hatter, Michael hurries to Cesari's to learn if Martha, still disguised as Lettie, has been courted by Howl.  Martha assures him she has never met Howl and Michael knows she isn't lying because she 'twiddled her thumbs the whole time', and she only stops doing that when she lies.\n*'''Fanny Hatter''' is Mr Hatter's second wife. She used to be the youngest, prettiest shop assistant in the hat shop. She is Martha's mother and is kind to all three girls. When she is widowed, she takes charge of the hat shop and places Lettie and Martha in promising apprenticeships, whilst keeping Sophie to trim hats. Shortly after Sophie disappears, she marries a wealthy man, Mr Sacheverell Smith (possibly thanks to a hat Sophie charmed), moves to a grand mansion in Vale End and sells the hat shop to Howl.  She continues to worry about Sophie, who mysteriously disappeared, and is relieved and happy when they meet again.\n*'''The King of Ingary''' employs Howl to produce transport spells. When the Witch of the Waste threatens his baby daughter Valeria, he sends Suliman the Royal Wizard to the Waste to deal with the Witch. When the King's brother disappears whilst looking for Wizard Suliman, he asks Howl to look for the missing men and get rid of the Witch of the Waste. He then appoints Howl as the Royal Wizard, a move which creates a bad mood in the household of the moving castle.\n*'''Prince Justin''' is the younger brother of the King of Ingary. Unsettled by Suliman's disappearance, he sets off to find him only to go missing himself.  The King of Ingary describes Justin as a brilliant general; with threats of war looming from both Strangia and High Norland, the King of Ingary becomes anxious and insistent that Prince Justin be found.\n*'''Mrs Penstemmon''' is a grand, talented old witch. She taught Mrs Fairfax, Suliman, and finally Howl; she is also mentioned as the teacher of Matilda, the Witch of Montalbino, in ''[[House of Many Ways]]''. She is proud of Howl's talent and wants him to be a good person but she is concerned he is heading the same way as the Witch of the Waste. When Sophie visits her while pretending to be Howl's mother, Mrs Penstemmon encourages Sophie to break the contract between Howl and Calcifer. She detects Sophie's magical gift and sees instantly that she's cursed, but cannot lift the Witch's spell. She is killed by the Witch of the Waste when she refuses to tell the Witch where Howl is.\n*'''Wizard Suliman''' is the Royal Wizard and personal advisor to the King of Ingary. He originally comes, like Howl, from Wales, where he was known as Benjamin Sullivan. He was Mrs Penstemmon's second-to-last pupil.  When the Witch threatens the King of Ingary's young daughter, he is dispatched to the Waste by the King. There he starts growing bushes and flowers in an attempt to reduce her power, but the Witch catches him. He projects most of his magic onto a scarecrow, which Sophie will talk life into. The Witch puts him to pieces and sells off his skull and guitar. She reassembles his body with parts of Prince Justin's (the head in particular) and calls him Gaston. She uses him to find out about Wales to get to Howl, then casts a spell on him that turns him into a dog. Calcifer guesses that one of his aliases is Percival. He takes on Lettie as an apprentice, because he is at least as strong willed as she is.\n*'''Mrs Annabel Fairfax''' is a witch, a former pupil of Mrs Penstemmon's. A widow, she lives in Upper Folding and is a friend of Fanny's. She is \"a plump, comfortable lady, with swathes of butter-coloured hair\". She is chatty and uses home-made honey in her spells.  She discovers quickly that Martha and Lettie have switched places, but accepts Lettie as her apprentice anyway and encourages her to accept Howl's advances and become his pupil, though Lettie eventually chooses Suliman instead. Though she tries, she is unable to lift the curse paced on Percival.{{what|date=February 2019}}.\n*'''Lily Angorian''' is an attractive schoolteacher in Wales who claims to be Benjamin Sullivan's fianc\u00e9e.  As such, she refuses to allow Howl to court her, though Sophie comes to believe that Howl is infatuated with her. She is later revealed to be the Witch of Waste's Fire Demon, and tries to take Howl's heart when the Witch of the Waste is killed. With the destruction of the Witch's heart, she is killed.\n*'''Percival''' is the witch's footman in the beginning, though she calls him \"Gaston\", but she curses him to be a dog. For this reason, he is called \"dog-man\" before his name is revealed. He can briefly turn into a man, but can barely get a few sentences out before turning back into a dog, though a different breed than he was before. In human form he is a nervous red-headed man with a crinkled brown suit. He for a time was with Lettie and Mrs. Fairfax before being sent to Sophie. When he and Lettie later meet they seem to get along swimmingly.\n\n==Major themes==\n''Howl's Moving Castle'' explores several themes, including: destiny, youth, courage and love. The first two are central to Sophie's progression. Early on, her perceived notion of destiny makes her believe that she is doomed to fail because she is the eldest of three sisters. This is in contrast to Howl, who sees himself as the master of his own fate, unafraid of what society thinks of him or what their conventions demand. Sophie's self-perceived failure is reflected in the Witch of the Waste's spell, which causes her outward appearance to become old and dull.\n\n==Allusions and references to other works==\nThe novel makes references to many other works of literature. [[John Donne]] is alluded to twice, first is in Chapter 10 when Howl refers to the first line of [[John Donne]]'s poem \"The Sun Rising\", saying \"Busy old fool, unruly Sophie.\"  Howl makes a reference to Donne again in Chapter 11, when Miss Angorian reads from his poem \"Song: Go and Catch a Falling Star\". The poem also serves as the inspiration for the terms of Howl's curse. In the same chapter there is a sign on Megan's house labelled \"[[Rivendell]]\", the \"Last Homely House\" in [[J. R. R. Tolkien]]'s ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]''. In Chapter 12 there is a reference to ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' when Howl tells Sophie \"We can't all be Mad Hatters.\" Howl refers to ''[[Hamlet]]'' in Chapter 17 when he quotes \"Alas, poor Yorick!\" and \"She heard mermaids, so it follows that something is rotten in the state of Denmark. I have an everlasting cold, but luckily I'm terribly dishonest. I cling to that.\"; another ''Hamlet'' reference occurs at the beginning of Chapter 11 referring to the nothingness in the doorway to Wales as being \"only an inch-thick after all\". The names of Suliman's alias [[Percival]], and Howl's brother-in-law [[Gareth]] are two of the [[Knights of the Round Table]], while Howl's own alias, [[Pendragon]], is derived from King Arthur's surname. The [[Witch of the Waste]]'s name is a possible pun on the [[Witch of the West]] from the novel ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'' and its [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|subsequent film]]. A traditional Welsh folk song, ''[[Sosban Fach]]'', is referred several times in the novel as \"Calcifer's silly saucepan song\".\n\n==Film adaptation==\n{{main|Howl's Moving Castle (film)}}\nThe novel was adapted into a [[Howl's Moving Castle (film)|2004 animated film]], written and directed by [[Hayao Miyazaki]] and produced by [[Studio Ghibli]]. The film was critically acclaimed, broke box office records in Japan, and was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Feature]].\n\n==Awards and nominations==\nIn 1986 ''Howl's Moving Castle'' was one of two runners-up for the annual [[Boston Globe-Horn Book Award]] in Fiction, behind ''In Summer Light'' by Zibby Oneal.<ref name = bghb/> It was also named one of that year's [[ALA Notable Books for Children]].\n\nJones and Howl won the annual [[Phoenix Award]] from the [[Children's Literature Association]] in 2006, recognising the best children's book published twenty years earlier that did not win a major award. Allusion to the [[Phoenix (mythology)|mythical bird phoenix]], which is reborn from its ashes, suggests the winning book's rise from obscurity.<ref name=phoenix />\n\n==In other media==\n[[A Thousand Times Repent]], a [[Christian metal|Christian]] [[deathcore]] band, took inspiration from ''Howl's Moving Castle'' in their [[Extended Play|EP]] ''[[Virtue Has Few Friends]]''. The song \"Take Me to the Witch of the Waste... We Have Much to Discuss\" mentions the Witch of the Waste and Suliman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darklyrics.com/lyrics/athousandtimesrepent/virtuehasfewfriends.html#3|title=\"Take Me to the Witch of the Waste...
