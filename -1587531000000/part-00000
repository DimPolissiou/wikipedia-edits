It ''[[de jure]]'' legalised a [[Political union|union]] of several [[Soviet republic (system of government)|Soviet republic]]s that had existed since 1919 and created a new [[Centralization|centralised]]  [[Federalism|federal government]] ([[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]] and [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]] (TsIK) were the legislative while [[Council of People's Commissars]] was the executive) where key functions were centralised in [[Moscow]].\n\nThe Treaty along with the [[Declaration of the Creation of the USSR]] was approved on 30 December 1922 by a conference of delegations from the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian SSR]] and the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian SSR]].

The treaty provided flexibility to admit new members. Therefore, by 1940 the Soviet Union grew from the founding four republics to [[republics of the Soviet Union|15 republics]].\n\nOn 8 December 1991, Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian Presidents signed the [[Belovezha Accords]]. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its founder states (denunciation of the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. On 10 December, the accord was ratified by the [[Supreme Soviet of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus|Belarusian]] parliaments. On 12 December, the agreement was ratified by the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Russian Parliament]], therefore the Russian SFSR renounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and [[de facto]] declared Russia's independence from the USSR.\n\nOn 26 December 1991, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR was self-dissolved]] by the [[Council of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|''Council of the Republics'' of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], the [[Upper house|first house]] of [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Soviet legislature]] (the [[Lower house|second house]], the ''[[Council of the Union]]'', was without a quorum).\n\n== Causes of the treaty ==\nThe Treaty was a result of many internal political conflicts within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]] and governments inside the Union. Initially [[Vladimir Lenin]] did not see that Russia's [[October Revolution]] would end all foreign borders as such.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} This view was supported by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers, who believed that Russia was only a first step in a future [[world revolution]]. However, as the [[Red Army]] approached the edges of the former Russian Empire and it's borders (including the newly created borders of areas that had declared independence after the October Revolution), it needed an excuse to cross them.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} One such method was a creation of an alternative government, a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]], that would then take over authority as the Red Army ousted the existing government. This was the case with [[Ukrainian War of Independence|Ukraine]], [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Georgia]], [[Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani War|Armenia and Azerbaijan]] and failed campaigns such as in the Baltic States and [[Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee|Poland]]. Alternatively it would use the presence of a minority to undermine the standing army (such as the establishment [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tatar]] and [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Bashkir]] autonomies), and where there was no national minority, a government based on geographical locale \u2013 [[Far Eastern Republic]], [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]].\n\nHowever, the [[Red Army]]'s ultimate failure in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War|Polish campaign]] placed the Bolshevik World Revolution plans on hold. Simultaneously the [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|growing figure]] of [[Joseph Stalin]] pursued a different [[Socialism in One Country|agenda]]. Lenin himself saw the creation of national republics as a permanent feature in line with his ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' policies.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} In spring of 1922, Lenin suffered his first stroke, and Stalin, still being a [[People's Commissariat for Nationalities|People's Commissar for Nationalities]] gained a new official chair as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]].\n\nStalin argued that now that the [[Russian Civil War]] had concluded and that [[war communism]] was now replaced by the [[New Economic Policy]], it required a country whose legal ''[[de jure]]'' framework would match its ''[[de facto]]'' one, and re-organising the Bolshevik state into a single sovereign entity. This included liquidating the many splinter Soviet governments and restoring supreme rule to Moscow.\n\nThis line went directly in conflict with both proponents of ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' and some of the local governments, most notably in Ukraine (opposition of [[Christian Rakovsky]]) and Georgia ([[Georgian Affair]]). Thus the treaty can be viewed as a compromise between the different groups within the Bolshevik camp, to satisfy the aspirations of large minorities (the named examples of Georgia and Ukraine) and to allow for potential expansion, as well. Byelorussia was the smallest republic, yet its official languages included [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] in addition to Russian and Belarusian to undermine the authority of the neighbouring [[Second Polish Republic]] and to use its sizeable Jewish minority, as well as the [[Western Belarus|Belarusians]] and [[Western Ukraine|Ukrainians in Poland]] as a future [[fifth column]]. At the same time, it created a new centralised federal government where key functions would clearly be in the hands of Moscow.\n\n===List of preceding treaties===\n* 30 September 1920, Military and Economical Union Treaty (Russian SFSR and Azerbaijan SSR)\n* 28 December 1920, Workers-Peasant Union Treaty (Russian SFSR and Ukrainian SSR)\n* 16 January 1921, Workers-Peasant Union Treaty (Russian SFSR and Belarusian SSR)<ref>[http://evolutio.info/content/view/883/140/ Relationships between Russian SFSR and Belarusian SSR in 1919-21]</ref>\n\n== Content ==\n[[File:Declaration and Treaty on the Creation of the USSR-1922-page3.jpg|thumb|Declaration and Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, 1922, page 3 (with signatures)]]\n\nThe original document included a cover sheet, the declaration, the treaty (containing the preface and 26 articles) and the signatures of the delegations that signed it.\n\nIn the cover sheet, the title ''Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'' was typed in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], as well as the actual words ''Treaty on the Formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'' also in those four languages.

According to the narrative, there are now two distinct camps, an \"exploiting\" [[capitalism|capitalist]] with [[colonialism]], [[chauvinism]] and [[social inequality|social]] and [[discrimination|ethnic]] inequalities and a \"free\" [[socialism|socialist]] one with mutual trust, peace and international cooperation and solidarity. The former sought to destroy the latter, but because of the common good that the latter is based on, the former has [[allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|failed]].\n\nThe declaration goes on and lists three factors as to why this Union is a necessary step. First of all, the aftermath of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] left many of the republics' economies destroyed, and rebuilding in the new socialist fashion is proving difficult without closer economic cooperation. Secondly, foreign threats continue to loom over the socialist camp, and its sovereignty requires an alliance for defence. Finally, the ideological factor, that the Soviet rule is [[Communist International|international]]ist in nature and pushes the [[working class|working masses]] to unite in a single socialist family. These three factors justify in uniting in a single state that would guarantee prosperity, security and development.\n\nFinally the declaration then specifies that the resultant Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is one that is created on free will of the peoples, that its purpose follows the ideals of the [[October Revolution]], that each and every socialist republic has the right to join and leave the Union at its own will, and hinting at the Soviet foreign policy of socialist [[irredentism]] (see [[World revolution]]), finishes stating that the treaty ''...will serve a decisive step on the path of unification of all workers into a \"World Socialist Soviet Republic\".''\n\nFollowing the declaration, is the treaty itself consisting of a preface and 26 articles.\n\n*In the preface it is fixed that the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic]], the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian Socialist Soviet Republic]] and the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] (containing [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]]) acting in free will, agree to form a single [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], that is governed on articles listed in the treaty.\n*Article 1 lists the competency of the responsibilities that the Union's authorities would contain. These include all foreign affairs; international treaties; change in external borders; expansion of the Union by accepting new republics; declaring war and agreeing to peace; foreign and domestic trade; authority over economic development; creating a single postal and transport services; the armed forces; internal migration; creation of single judiciary, education and healthcare services as well as unifying all units of measurement. All of the above would be thus explicitly controlled directly by the Union's authority. Moreover, the final clause explicitly listed, that the Union's authorities could now overturn acts of all Republics' authorities (be it Congresses of Soviets, Soviets of People's Commissars or Central Executive Committees) that were deemed in violation with regard to this Treaty.\n*Articles 2\u201310 determined the structure of supreme authorities of the Union. The [[legislature|legislative authority]], according to the treaty, was the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]] and between the congresses, this was to be carried out by the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]] (TsIK) (2). The delegates to the Congress are to be elected by local Soviets represented by one elected representative from 25,000 voters in urban areas and one per 125,000 voters in rural areas (3). The Congress delegates would be elected by local [[Guberniya]] Soviets, rather than Republican ones (4). The congresses would be held annually or may be summoned by requests of at least two Republics' or the Union's TsIK (5). The TsIK would be the main body to carry out executive functions between the congresses. This TsiK was a 371-person body, whose members were proportionally represented to the population of the Union, and elected by the Congress (6). The Union TsIK would meet four times per annum on a regular basis, whilst irregular sessions can be summoned on demand by the Union government (the [[Council of People's Commissars]]) or by one of the constituent Republics (7). The Congress and the TsIK would be held in the capitals of the Union Republics in the order that would be decided by TsIK's Presidium (8). The latter was to be appointed by TsIK, that would be the supreme power organ between its sessions (9). This Presidium would consist of nineteen members, with four chairmen, each representing the four republics (10). The Presidium also had the authority to summon an irregular session of TsIK.\n*Article 11 appointed the [[executive (government)|executive authority]], the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (SNK). The council's members were appointed by TsIK, and included ten [[ministry (government department)|portfolios]] (commissariats) as well as a chairmen and his deputies.\n*Article 12 specified the functions of the [[Supreme Court of the Soviet Union]] (under control of TsIK) and the secret police, the [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]] (under control of the SNK, and the OGPU chairman was to be a participant of the SNK with advisory vote). The creation of these two bodies was justified as ''measures to overcome criminal and counter-revolutionary elements'' in that very article.\n*Articles 13\u201317 specified the framework on the legal proceedings between the Union's supreme bodies (the TsIK and the SNK) and those of each republic. All of the decrees by Union's SNK were effective in every republic (13). Also confirmed, was the multilingual aspect of the Union, specifying that all of the Union's decrees are to printed in the official language of each constituent republic ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and ''[[Turkic languages|Turkic]]'' (i.e. [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]])) (14). It was specified that the Union's SNK resolution may only be overruled by the Union's TsIK or its Presidium (16), and if a republican TsIK chooses to protest the resolution or a decree of the Union's TsIK, the protest itself does not halt the implementation of the document (15). The latter is only possible if there are obvious violations with existing laws, and in such cases, the republic must immediately notify the Union's SNK and the relevant commissariat (17).\n*Article 18 listed the authorities that would be retained by the Republics and specified their respective Councils of People's Commissars, each to have a chairmen, his deputies, eleven portfolios and [[plenipotentiary|representatives]] with advisory votes of several Union-level commissariats, in particular foreign affairs, defence, foreign trade, transport and logistics.\n*At the same time article 19 specified that republican-level organs, the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]] (whose chairman was to also have a full seat in the relevant republican SNK), the commissariats for food supply, finance and labour, as well as the Soviet inspection (the [[Rabkrin]]) though subjugated to the Republican authorities, their activities were to be regulated by the Union's TsIK.\n*Article 20 discussed that the [[government budget|budget]]s of the Republics would form the Union's budget and that all expenses and spendings by the Republics would be determined by the Union's TsIK. Moreover, the latter would also determine the share of profits, if any, that each Republic would receive.\n*Articles 21\u201323 created a single [[Soviet people|Soviet citizenship]] (21), state symbolism ([[Flag of the Soviet Union|flag]], [[The Internationale#Russian lyrics|national anthem]] and a [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union|coat of arms]] \u2013 22), and specified the Union's capital in [[Moscow]] (23).\n*Article 24 demanded that the republics amended their constitutions with regard to the treaty.\n*Article 25 specified that any amendments, additions or changes to the treaty may be done only by the Union's [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]].\n*Article 26 affirmed the clause in the declaration where each republic has the right to leave the Union.\n\n==Immediate aftermath==\n\n===Politics===\nInitially, the treaty did little to alter the major political spectrum. Most of the governing positions of the RSFSR's supreme organs were automatically transferred to the USSR's. For example, the Chairman of the All-Union Central Executive Committee (TsIK) was taken by [[Mikhail Kalinin]], who would retain his chair as Russia's TsIK. Likewise, Lenin's position as chairman of RSFSR's [[Council of People's Commissars]] (SNK), which he held since the Revolution, would now to be transformed as the Chairman of the Union's SNK. However, as Lenin remained ill from the stroke, both of his chairs would be occupied by [[Alexei Rykov]] as acting head of the government.\n\n[[Joseph Stalin]]'s position as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] was also unchanged. However, the Party's position was. Prior to the treaty the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) (RKP(b)), had its own bureaus which oversaw the activities in distant regions (e.g. Turkestani bureau, Transcaucasian bureau, etc.). After the Treaty, the party was re-organized as the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) (VKP(b) \u2013 V for Vsesoyuznaya, the All-Union). Whilst the Republic's parties remained, Russia's party not only retained its ''[[primus inter pares]]'' position but officially took over as a supreme authority in the USSR.\n\n===Central Asia===\nOne area where the Soviet division of power was not resolved at the time of the Treaty's signing, was [[Soviet Central Asia]] which contained several problems. A major battleground during the [[Russian Civil War]], the region would remain unstable afterward. [[Turkestan]] had come under [[Russian Turkestan|Russian control]] fairly recently, between 1867 and 1885. Moreover, unlike other ethnic borders of the former [[Russian Empire]], which were delimited during the Tsarist days (e.g. [[Transcaucasia]] lost its feudal administration by the mid-19th century), the Soviet authorities inherited two provinces that were ''de jure'' never part of Russia proper, the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. During the Russian Civil War, these too shared the fate of the other republics, but even here their special status was preserved, and they were established as the [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic|Bukharan]] and [[Khorezm People's Soviet Republic|Khorezm ''People's'' Soviet Republics]]. Despite [[Mikhail Frunze]]'s victories, the conflict was ongoing and whole provinces were under control of the [[Basmachi movement]] in 1922.\n\nTo settle this issue, in line with the ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' policy a massive programme of [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union#National delimitation in Central Asia|national delimitation in Central Asia]] was undertaken. On October 27, 1924, TsIK issued a decree where the former Bukharan, Khivan People's Republics as well as the RSFSR's [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]] were re-organized as the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek SSR]] and the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmen SSR]], both of whom became full Union Republics on 13 May 1925. The borders of the new republics matched the ethnic ones, and Uzbekistan initially also contained a newly formed [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], which would be elevated to a full Union Republic on October 16, 1929, becoming the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik SSR]].\n\n===Soviet Constitution===\n{{main article|1924 Soviet Constitution}}\nIn January 1924, the Second [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]], that was called in accordance to the Treaty ratified the first [[1924 Soviet Constitution]]. The Constitution's text is essentially the re-written and expanded Treaty. It even contains the same Declaration. Whereas the Treaty contained 26 articles, the Constitution is split into eleven chapters containing 72 articles.\n\n==Aftermath and legality==\nSome experts argue that the original ''Union'' of Soviet Socialist Republics, ceased to exist as such, upon the adoption of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] on 5 December 1936 which greatly altered the internal arrangement and re-organised the USSR from a Union-based [[confederation]], into a proper federal country. Instead of the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]], the new Constitution created a permanent parliament, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]]. It also tied together most of the authorities and most significantly affirmed the role of the Communist Party as the ''driving force'' behind the USSR's working masses.\n\nWith regard to the original Treaty, the adoption of the Constitution re-organised the make-up of the Union. The Transcaucasian SFSR ceased to exist and the three republics that made it up were fully admitted to the Union. Simultaneously two of RSFSR's autonomies, the [[Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic|Kazak]] and the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz ASSR]]s were re-organised as full republics. Therefore, the seven became the eleven.\n\nThe Transcaucasian SFSR existed until December 5, 1936, when it was broken into [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian]] and [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijani]] SSRs. The same day Kazak and Kirghiz ASSRs of the RSFSR ceased to exist, and their territory was divided between the new Kazakh and Kirghiz SSRs.\n\n== 1940 ==\nIn a prelude to [[World War II]], several new republics were created prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of USSR in 1941]]. The first was the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]], which on 31 March 1940 was elevated to a union republic from the [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelian ASSR]], previously part of the RSFSR.\n\nAfter the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|annexation of Baltic states]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] were transformed into the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuanian SSR]] (July 13), [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]] (July 21) and [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]] (also July 21), and were formally adjoined to the Soviet Union on 3, 5 and 6 August respectively. The final republic was the [[Moldovian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovian SSR]] that merged the large territory of [[Bessarabia]] with the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovian ASSR]] previously part of the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nAfter World War II, no new republics were established, instead, the Karello-Finnish SSR was downgraded into an autonomous republic and re-annexed by the RSFSR on July 16, 1956.\n\n==Annulment==\nOn December 8, 1991, the leaders of the Ukrainian and Belorussian SSRs, and the RSFSR met [[Belavezha Accords|to agree on the annulment of the 1922 treaty]], which was terminated on December 25, 1991, effectively [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolving the USSR]].\n\nOn March 15, 1996, the [[State Duma]] of the Russian Federation expressed its legal position in relation to the decision of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR]] in \"The denunciation of the Treaty establishing the Soviet Union\" as the wrongful, unconstitutional act passed by a grave violation of the Constitution of the RSFSR, the norms of international law and then in force legislation.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://ntc.duma.gov.ru/bpa/docview.phtml?bpaid=1&code=34000&rdk=0&nv=0 \u041f\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0410\u041d\u041e\u0412\u041b\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0415 \u0413\u041e\u0421\u0423\u0414\u0410\u0420\u0421\u0422\u0412\u0415\u041d\u041d\u041e\u0419 \u0414\u0423\u041c\u042b \u0424\u0415\u0414\u0415\u0420\u0410\u041b\u042c\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u0421\u041e\u0411\u0420\u0410\u041d\u0418\u042f \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0419\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u0424\u0415\u0414\u0415\u0420\u0410\u0426\u0418\u0418] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417152935/http://ntc.duma.gov.ru/bpa/docview.phtml?bpaid=1&code=34000&rdk=0&nv=0 |date=2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\n== Timeline ==\n* December 21, 1922 \u2013 Treaty signed.\n* December 30, 1922 \u2013 Treaty ratified.\n* October 27, 1924 \u2013 Uzbek and Turkmen populated regions of the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan ASSR]] (previously of RSFSR) elevated into union republics.\n* October 16, 1929 \u2013 [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik SSR]] created from the [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik ASSR]] (previously part of the RSFSR).\n* December 5, 1936 \u2013 with the adoption of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]]: \n** Split of the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]] into [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian]] and [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijani]] SSRs.\n**Elevation of the RSFSR-administered  Kazakh and Kirgiz ASSRs into [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh]] and [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz SSR]]s.\n* March 31, 1940 \u2013 in the aftermath of the [[Winter War]], [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelian ASSR]] and the territories ceded by Finland ([[Finnish Democratic Republic]]) were merged into the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]].\n* [[Occupation of the Baltic states]] by the USSR followed by their annexation:\n** August 3, 1940 \u2013 [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuanian SSR]] was incorporated into the USSR.\n** August 5, 1940 \u2013 [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]] was incorporated into the USSR.\n** August 6, 1940 \u2013 [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]] was incorporated into the USSR.\n* August 24, 1940 \u2013 [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR]] created from the Ukrainian administered Moldavian ASSR and annexed Romanian territory of [[Bessarabia]].\n* July 16, 1956 \u2013 [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]] downgraded into an autonomous republic and re-annexed by RSFSR.\n* August 24, 1991 -

The treaty provided flexibility to admit new members. Therefore, by 1940 the Soviet Union grew from the founding four republics to [[republics of the Soviet Union|15 republics]].\n\nOn 8 December 1991, Russian, Ukrainian and Belarusian Presidents signed the [[Belovezha Accords]]. The agreement declared dissolution of the USSR by its founder states (denunciation of the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR) and established the [[Commonwealth of Independent States|CIS]]. On 10 December, the accord was ratified by the [[Supreme Soviet of Ukraine|Ukrainian]] and [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus|Belarusian]] parliaments. On 12 December, the agreement was ratified by the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Russian Parliament]], therefore the Russian SFSR renounced the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR and [[de facto]] declared Russia's independence from the USSR.\n\nOn 26 December 1991, the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|USSR was self-dissolved]] by the [[Council of the Republics of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|''Council of the Republics'' of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]], the [[Upper house|first house]] of [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Soviet legislature]] (the [[Lower house|second house]], the ''[[Council of the Union]]'', was without a quorum).\n\n== Causes of the treaty ==\nThe Treaty was a result of many internal political conflicts within the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]] and governments inside the Union. Initially [[Vladimir Lenin]] did not see that Russia's [[October Revolution]] would end all foreign borders as such.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} This view was supported by [[Leon Trotsky]] and his followers, who believed that Russia was only a first step in a future [[world revolution]]. However, as the [[Red Army]] approached former internal national and foreign borders, it needed an excuse to cross them.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} One such method was a creation of an alternative government, a [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet Republic]], that would then take over authority as the Red Army ousted the existing government. This was the case with [[Ukrainian War of Independence|Ukraine]], [[Red Army invasion of Georgia|Georgia]], [[Armenian\u2013Azerbaijani War|Armenia and Azerbaijan]] and failed campaigns such as in the Baltic States and [[Provisional Polish Revolutionary Committee|Poland]]. Alternatively it would use the presence of a minority to undermine the standing army (such as the establishment [[Tatar Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tatar]] and [[Bashkir Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Bashkir]] autonomies), and where there was no national minority, a government based on geographical locale \u2013 [[Far Eastern Republic]], [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]].\n\nHowever, the [[Red Army]]'s ultimate failure in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War|Polish campaign]] placed the Bolshevik World Revolution plans on hold. Simultaneously the [[Rise of Joseph Stalin|growing figure]] of [[Joseph Stalin]] pursued a different [[Socialism in One Country|agenda]]. Lenin himself saw the creation of national republics as a permanent feature in line with his ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' policies.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} In spring of 1922, Lenin suffered his first stroke, and Stalin, still being a [[People's Commissariat for Nationalities|People's Commissar for Nationalities]] gained a new official chair as the [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]].\n\nStalin argued that now that the [[Russian Civil War]] had concluded and that [[war communism]] was now replaced by the [[New Economic Policy]], it required a country whose legal ''[[de jure]]'' framework would match its ''[[de facto]]'' one, and re-organising the Bolshevik state into a single sovereign entity. This included liquidating the many splinter Soviet governments and restoring supreme rule to Moscow.\n\nThis line went directly in conflict with both proponents of ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' and some of the local governments, most notably in Ukraine (opposition of [[Christian Rakovsky]]) and Georgia ([[Georgian Affair]]). Thus the treaty can be viewed as a compromise between the different groups within the Bolshevik camp, to satisfy the aspirations of large minorities (the named examples of Georgia and Ukraine) and to allow for potential expansion, as well. Byelorussia was the smallest republic, yet its official languages included [[Polish language|Polish]] and [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] in addition to Russian and Belarusian to undermine the authority of the neighbouring [[Second Polish Republic]] and to use its sizeable Jewish minority, as well as the [[Western Belarus|Belarusians]] and [[Western Ukraine|Ukrainians in Poland]] as a future [[fifth column]]. At the same time, it created a new centralised federal government where key functions would clearly be in the hands of Moscow.\n\n===List of preceding treaties===\n* 30 September 1920, Military and Economical Union Treaty (Russian SFSR and Azerbaijan SSR)\n* 28 December 1920, Workers-Peasant Union Treaty (Russian SFSR and Ukrainian SSR)\n* 16 January 1921, Workers-Peasant Union Treaty (Russian SFSR and Belarusian SSR)<ref>[http://evolutio.info/content/view/883/140/ Relationships between Russian SFSR and Belarusian SSR in 1919-21]</ref>\n\n== Content ==\n[[File:Declaration and Treaty on the Creation of the USSR-1922-page3.jpg|thumb|Declaration and Treaty on the Creation of the USSR, 1922, page 3 (with signatures)]]\n\nThe original document included a cover sheet, the declaration, the treaty (containing the preface and 26 articles) and the signatures of the delegations that signed it.\n\nIn the cover sheet, the title ''Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'' was typed in [[Russian language|Russian]], [[French language|French]], [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]], as well as the actual words ''Treaty on the Formation of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'' also in those four languages. It contained the original [[state emblem of the Soviet Union]].\n\nThe [[Declaration of the Creation of the USSR|declaration]] was written as a reflection on contemporary [[international relations]] and why the treaty was necessary. According to the narrative, there are now two distinct camps, an \"exploiting\" [[capitalism|capitalist]] with [[colonialism]], [[chauvinism]] and [[social inequality|social]] and [[discrimination|ethnic]] inequalities and a \"free\" [[socialism|socialist]] one with mutual trust, peace and international cooperation and solidarity. The former sought to destroy the latter, but because of the common good that the latter is based on, the former has [[allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|failed]].\n\nThe declaration goes on and lists three factors as to why this Union is a necessary step. First of all, the aftermath of the [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]] left many of the republics' economies destroyed, and rebuilding in the new socialist fashion is proving difficult without closer economic cooperation. Secondly, foreign threats continue to loom over the socialist camp, and its sovereignty requires an alliance for defence. Finally, the ideological factor, that the Soviet rule is [[Communist International|international]]ist in nature and pushes the [[working class|working masses]] to unite in a single socialist family. These three factors justify in uniting in a single state that would guarantee prosperity, security and development.\n\nFinally the declaration then specifies that the resultant Union of Soviet Socialist Republics is one that is created on free will of the peoples, that its purpose follows the ideals of the [[October Revolution]], that each and every socialist republic has the right to join and leave the Union at its own will, and hinting at the Soviet foreign policy of socialist [[irredentism]] (see [[World revolution]]), finishes stating that the treaty ''...will serve a decisive step on the path of unification of all workers into a \"World Socialist Soviet Republic\".''\n\nFollowing the declaration, is the treaty itself consisting of a preface and 26 articles.\n\n*In the preface it is fixed that the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]], the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Ukrainian Socialist Soviet Republic]], the [[Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic|Byelorussian Socialist Soviet Republic]] and the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic]] (containing [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Azerbaijan]] and [[Armenia]]) acting in free will, agree to form a single [[Soviet Union|Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], that is governed on articles listed in the treaty.\n*Article 1 lists the competency of the responsibilities that the Union's authorities would contain. These include all foreign affairs; international treaties; change in external borders; expansion of the Union by accepting new republics; declaring war and agreeing to peace; foreign and domestic trade; authority over economic development; creating a single postal and transport services; the armed forces; internal migration; creation of single judiciary, education and healthcare services as well as unifying all units of measurement. All of the above would be thus explicitly controlled directly by the Union's authority. Moreover, the final clause explicitly listed, that the Union's authorities could now overturn acts of all Republics' authorities (be it Congresses of Soviets, Soviets of People's Commissars or Central Executive Committees) that were deemed in violation with regard to this Treaty.\n*Articles 2\u201310 determined the structure of supreme authorities of the Union. The [[legislature|legislative authority]], according to the treaty, was the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]] and between the congresses, this was to be carried out by the [[Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union]] (TsIK) (2). The delegates to the Congress are to be elected by local Soviets represented by one elected representative from 25,000 voters in urban areas and one per 125,000 voters in rural areas (3). The Congress delegates would be elected by local [[Guberniya]] Soviets, rather than Republican ones (4). The congresses would be held annually or may be summoned by requests of at least two Republics' or the Union's TsIK (5). The TsIK would be the main body to carry out executive functions between the congresses. This TsiK was a 371-person body, whose members were proportionally represented to the population of the Union, and elected by the Congress (6). The Union TsIK would meet four times per annum on a regular basis, whilst irregular sessions can be summoned on demand by the Union government (the [[Council of People's Commissars]]) or by one of the constituent Republics (7). The Congress and the TsIK would be held in the capitals of the Union Republics in the order that would be decided by TsIK's Presidium (8). The latter was to be appointed by TsIK, that would be the supreme power organ between its sessions (9). This Presidium would consist of nineteen members, with four chairmen, each representing the four republics (10). The Presidium also had the authority to summon an irregular session of TsIK.\n*Article 11 appointed the [[executive (government)|executive authority]], the [[Council of People's Commissars]] (SNK). The council's members were appointed by TsIK, and included ten [[ministry (government department)|portfolios]] (commissariats) as well as a chairmen and his deputies.\n*Article 12 specified the functions of the [[Supreme Court of the Soviet Union]] (under control of TsIK) and the secret police, the [[State Political Directorate|OGPU]] (under control of the SNK, and the OGPU chairman was to be a participant of the SNK with advisory vote). The creation of these two bodies was justified as ''measures to overcome criminal and counter-revolutionary elements'' in that very article.\n*Articles 13\u201317 specified the framework on the legal proceedings between the Union's supreme bodies (the TsIK and the SNK) and those of each republic. All of the decrees by Union's SNK were effective in every republic (13). Also confirmed, was the multilingual aspect of the Union, specifying that all of the Union's decrees are to printed in the official language of each constituent republic ([[Russian language|Russian]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]], [[Georgian language|Georgian]], [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and ''[[Turkic languages|Turkic]]'' (i.e. [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]])) (14). It was specified that the Union's SNK resolution may only be overruled by the Union's TsIK or its Presidium (16), and if a republican TsIK chooses to protest the resolution or a decree of the Union's TsIK, the protest itself does not halt the implementation of the document (15). The latter is only possible if there are obvious violations with existing laws, and in such cases, the republic must immediately notify the Union's SNK and the relevant commissariat (17).\n*Article 18 listed the authorities that would be retained by the Republics and specified their respective Councils of People's Commissars, each to have a chairmen, his deputies, eleven portfolios and [[plenipotentiary|representatives]] with advisory votes of several Union-level commissariats, in particular foreign affairs, defence, foreign trade, transport and logistics.\n*At the same time article 19 specified that republican-level organs, the [[Supreme Soviet of the National Economy]] (whose chairman was to also have a full seat in the relevant republican SNK), the commissariats for food supply, finance and labour, as well as the Soviet inspection (the [[Rabkrin]]) though subjugated to the Republican authorities, their activities were to be regulated by the Union's TsIK.\n*Article 20 discussed that the [[government budget|budget]]s of the Republics would form the Union's budget and that all expenses and spendings by the Republics would be determined by the Union's TsIK. Moreover, the latter would also determine the share of profits, if any, that each Republic would receive.\n*Articles 21\u201323 created a single [[Soviet people|Soviet citizenship]] (21), state symbolism ([[Flag of the Soviet Union|flag]], [[The Internationale#Russian lyrics|national anthem]] and a [[State Emblem of the Soviet Union|coat of arms]] \u2013 22), and specified the Union's capital in [[Moscow]] (23).\n*Article 24 demanded that the republics amended their constitutions with regard to the treaty.\n*Article 25 specified that any amendments, additions or changes to the treaty may be done only by the Union's [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]].\n*Article 26 affirmed the clause in the declaration where each republic has the right to leave the Union.\n\n==Immediate aftermath==\n\n===Politics===\nInitially, the treaty did little to alter the major political spectrum. Most of the governing positions of the RSFSR's supreme organs were automatically transferred to the USSR's. For example, the Chairman of the All-Union Central Executive Committee (TsIK) was taken by [[Mikhail Kalinin]], who would retain his chair as Russia's TsIK. Likewise, Lenin's position as chairman of RSFSR's [[Council of People's Commissars]] (SNK), which he held since the Revolution, would now to be transformed as the Chairman of the Union's SNK. However, as Lenin remained ill from the stroke, both of his chairs would be occupied by [[Alexei Rykov]] as acting head of the government.\n\n[[Joseph Stalin]]'s position as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|General Secretary of the Communist Party]] was also unchanged. However, the Party's position was. Prior to the treaty the Russian Communist Party (bolsheviks) (RKP(b)), had its own bureaus which oversaw the activities in distant regions (e.g. Turkestani bureau, Transcaucasian bureau, etc.). After the Treaty, the party was re-organized as the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) (VKP(b) \u2013 V for Vsesoyuznaya, the All-Union). Whilst the Republic's parties remained, Russia's party not only retained its ''[[primus inter pares]]'' position but officially took over as a supreme authority in the USSR.\n\n===Central Asia===\nOne area where the Soviet division of power was not resolved at the time of the Treaty's signing, was [[Soviet Central Asia]] which contained several problems. A major battleground during the [[Russian Civil War]], the region would remain unstable afterward. [[Turkestan]] had come under [[Russian Turkestan|Russian control]] fairly recently, between 1867 and 1885. Moreover, unlike other ethnic borders of the former [[Russian Empire]], which were delimited during the Tsarist days (e.g. [[Transcaucasia]] lost its feudal administration by the mid-19th century), the Soviet authorities inherited two provinces that were ''de jure'' never part of Russia proper, the [[Emirate of Bukhara]] and the [[Khanate of Khiva]]. During the Russian Civil War, these too shared the fate of the other republics, but even here their special status was preserved, and they were established as the [[Bukharan People's Soviet Republic|Bukharan]] and [[Khorezm People's Soviet Republic|Khorezm ''People's'' Soviet Republics]]. Despite [[Mikhail Frunze]]'s victories, the conflict was ongoing and whole provinces were under control of the [[Basmachi movement]] in 1922.\n\nTo settle this issue, in line with the ''[[korenizatsiya]]'' policy a massive programme of [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union#National delimitation in Central Asia|national delimitation in Central Asia]] was undertaken. On October 27, 1924, TsIK issued a decree where the former Bukharan, Khivan People's Republics as well as the RSFSR's [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan]] were re-organized as the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek SSR]] and the [[Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkmen SSR]], both of whom became full Union Republics on 13 May 1925. The borders of the new republics matched the ethnic ones, and Uzbekistan initially also contained a newly formed [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], which would be elevated to a full Union Republic on October 16, 1929, becoming the [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik SSR]].\n\n===Soviet Constitution===\n{{main article|1924 Soviet Constitution}}\nIn January 1924, the Second [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union]], that was called in accordance to the Treaty ratified the first [[1924 Soviet Constitution]]. The Constitution's text is essentially the re-written and expanded Treaty. It even contains the same Declaration. Whereas the Treaty contained 26 articles, the Constitution is split into eleven chapters containing 72 articles.\n\n==Aftermath and legality==\nSome experts argue that the original ''Union'' of Soviet Socialist Republics, ceased to exist as such, upon the adoption of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]] on 5 December 1936 which greatly altered the internal arrangement and re-organised the USSR from a Union-based [[confederation]], into a proper federal country. Instead of the [[Congress of Soviets of the Soviet Union|Congress of Soviets]], the new Constitution created a permanent parliament, the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union|Supreme Soviet]]. It also tied together most of the authorities and most significantly affirmed the role of the Communist Party as the ''driving force'' behind the USSR's working masses.\n\nWith regard to the original Treaty, the adoption of the Constitution re-organised the make-up of the Union. The Transcaucasian SFSR ceased to exist and the three republics that made it up were fully admitted to the Union. Simultaneously two of RSFSR's autonomies, the [[Kazakh Autonomous Socialist Soviet Republic|Kazak]] and the [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz ASSR]]s were re-organised as full republics. Therefore, the seven became the eleven.\n\nThe Transcaucasian SFSR existed until December 5, 1936, when it was broken into [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian]] and [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijani]] SSRs. The same day [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] of the RSFSR ceased to exist, and its territory was divided between the new Kazakh and Kirghiz SSRs.\n\n== 1940 ==\nIn a prelude to [[World War II]], several new republics were created prior to the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion of USSR in 1941]]. The first was the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]], which on 31 March 1940 was elevated to a union republic from the [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelian ASSR]], previously part of the RSFSR.\n\nAfter the [[Soviet occupation of the Baltic states (1940)|annexation of Baltic states]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] were transformed into the [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuanian SSR]] (July 13), [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]] (July 21) and [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]] (also July 21), and were formally adjoined to the Soviet Union on 3, 5 and 6 August respectively. The final republic was the [[Moldovian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovian SSR]] that merged the large territory of [[Bessarabia]] with the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldovian ASSR]] previously part of the Ukrainian SSR.\n\nAfter World War II, no new republics were established, instead, the Karello-Finnish SSR was downgraded into an autonomous republic and re-annexed by the RSFSR on July 16, 1956.\n\n==Annulment==\nOn December 8, 1991, the leaders of the Ukrainian and Belorussian SSRs, and the RSFSR met [[Belavezha Accords|to agree on the annulment of the 1922 treaty]], which was terminated on December 25, 1991, effectively [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|dissolving the USSR]].\n\nOn March 15, 1996, the [[State Duma]] of the Russian Federation expressed its legal position in relation to the decision of the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia|Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR]] in \"The denunciation of the Treaty establishing the Soviet Union\" as the wrongful, unconstitutional act passed by a grave violation of the Constitution of the RSFSR, the norms of international law and then in force legislation.<ref>{{in lang|ru}} [http://ntc.duma.gov.ru/bpa/docview.phtml?bpaid=1&code=34000&rdk=0&nv=0 \u041f\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0410\u041d\u041e\u0412\u041b\u0415\u041d\u0418\u0415 \u0413\u041e\u0421\u0423\u0414\u0410\u0420\u0421\u0422\u0412\u0415\u041d\u041d\u041e\u0419 \u0414\u0423\u041c\u042b \u0424\u0415\u0414\u0415\u0420\u0410\u041b\u042c\u041d\u041e\u0413\u041e \u0421\u041e\u0411\u0420\u0410\u041d\u0418\u042f \u0420\u041e\u0421\u0421\u0418\u0419\u0421\u041a\u041e\u0419 \u0424\u0415\u0414\u0415\u0420\u0410\u0426\u0418\u0418] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110417152935/http://ntc.duma.gov.ru/bpa/docview.phtml?bpaid=1&code=34000&rdk=0&nv=0 |date=2011-04-17 }}</ref>\n\n== Timeline ==\n* December 21, 1922 \u2013 Treaty signed.\n* December 30, 1922 \u2013 Treaty ratified.\n* October 27, 1924 \u2013 Uzbek and Turkmen populated regions of the [[Turkestan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Turkestan ASSR]] (previously of RSFSR) elevated into union republics.\n* October 16, 1929 \u2013 [[Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik SSR]] created from the [[Tajik Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Tajik ASSR]] (previously part of the RSFSR).\n* December 5, 1936 \u2013 with the adoption of the [[1936 Soviet Constitution]]: \n** Split of the [[Transcaucasian Socialist Federative Soviet Republic|Transcaucasian SFSR]] into [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian]], [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian]] and [[Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic|Azerbaijani]] SSRs.\n**Elevation of the RSFSR-administered  Kazakh and Kirgiz ASSRs into [[Kazakh Soviet Socialist Republic|Kazakh]] and [[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Kirghiz SSR]]s.\n* March 31, 1940 \u2013 in the aftermath of the [[Winter War]], [[Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelian ASSR]] and the territories ceded by Finland ([[Finnish Democratic Republic]]) were merged into the [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]].\n* [[Occupation of the Baltic states]] by the USSR followed by their annexation:\n** August 3, 1940 \u2013 [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuanian SSR]] was incorporated into the USSR.\n** August 5, 1940 \u2013 [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvian SSR]] was incorporated into the USSR.\n** August 6, 1940 \u2013 [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonian SSR]] was incorporated into the USSR.\n* August 24, 1940 \u2013 [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic|Moldavian SSR]] created from the Ukrainian administered Moldavian ASSR and annexed Romanian territory of [[Bessarabia]].\n* July 16, 1956 \u2013 [[Karelo-Finnish Soviet Socialist Republic|Karelo-Finnish SSR]] downgraded into an autonomous republic and re-annexed by RSFSR.\n* August 24, 1991 -

After Iranian students stormed the American embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and took 52 Americans hostage, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] imposed an [[arms embargo]] on Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} After [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|Iraq unsuccessfully invaded Iran]] in September 1980, Iran needed weapons and spare parts for its current weapons. After Ronald Reagan took office as President on 20 January 1981, he vowed to continue Carter's policy of blocking arms sales to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nA group of senior Reagan administration officials in the Senior Interdepartmental Group conducted a secret study on 21 July 1981, and concluded that the arms embargo was ineffective because Iran could always buy arms and spare parts for its American weapons elsewhere, while at the same time the arms embargo opened the door for Iran to fall into the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] as the Kremlin could sell Iran weapons if the United States would not.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} The conclusion was that the United States should start selling Iran arms as soon as it was politically possible to keep Iran from falling into the Soviet sphere of influence.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} At the same time, the openly declared goal of Ayatollah Khomeini to export his Islamic revolution all over the Middle East and overthrow the governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|other states around the Persian Gulf]] led to the Americans perceiving Khomeini as a major threat to the United States.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nIn the spring of 1983, the United States launched [[Operation Staunch]], a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to persuade other nations all over the world not to sell arms or spare parts for weapons to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} At least part of the reason the Iran\u2013Contra affair proved so humiliating for the United States when the story first broke in November 1986 that the US was selling arms to Iran was that American diplomats, as part of Operation Staunch had, from the spring of 1983 on, been lecturing other nations about how morally wrong it was to sell arms to the Islamic Republic of Iran and applying strong pressure to prevent these arms sales to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nAt the same time that the American government was considering their options on selling arms to Iran, [[Contras|Contra]] militants based in [[Honduras]] were waging a guerrilla war to topple the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) revolutionary government of [[Nicaragua]].

Funding ran out for the Contras by July 1984, and in October a total ban was placed in effect. The second Boland Amendment, in effect from 3 October 1984 to 3 December 1985, stated:<blockquote>During the fiscal year 1985 no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of or which may have the effect of supporting directly or indirectly military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, organization, group, movement, or individual.{{r|Hicks|p=965}}</blockquote> In violation of the Boland Amendment, senior officials of the Reagan administration continued to secretly arm and train the Contras and provide arms to Iran, an operation they called \"the Enterprise\".<ref name=\"Johnston\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/09/us/secord-is-guilty-of-one-charge-in-contra-affair.html |title=Secord Is Guilty Of One Charge In Contra Affair |work=The New York Times |edition=National |page=A00024 |first=David |last=Johnston |accessdate=19 July 2011 |date=9 November 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Corn |first=David |title=Is There Really A 'Secret Team'? |work=The Nation |date=2 July 1988}}</ref> As the Contras were heavily dependent upon U.S. military and financial support, the second Boland amendment threatened to break the Contra movement and led to President Reagan in 1984 to order the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) to \"keep the Contras together 'body and soul'\", no matter what Congress voted for.{{r|Hicks|p=965}}\n\nA major legal debate at the center of the Iran\u2013Contra affair concerned the question of whether the NSC was one of the \"any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities\" covered by the Boland amendment. The Reagan administration argued it was not, and many in Congress argued that it was.{{r|Hicks|p=965}} The majority of constitutional scholars have asserted the NSC did indeed fall within the purview of the second Boland amendment, though the amendment did not mention the NSC by name.{{r|Hicks|p=966}} The broader constitutional question at stake was the power of Congress versus the power of the presidency. The Reagan administration argued that because the constitution assigned the right to conduct foreign policy to the executive, its efforts to overthrow the government of Nicaragua were a presidential prerogative that Congress had no right to try to halt via the Boland amendments.{{r|Hicks|p=964}} By contrast congressional leaders argued that the constitution had assigned Congress control of the budget, and Congress had every right to use that power not to fund projects like attempting to overthrow the government of Nicaragua that they disapproved of.{{r|Hicks|p=964}} As part of the effort to circumvent the Boland amendment, the NSC established \"the Enterprise\", an arms-smuggling network headed by a retired U.S. Air Force officer turned arms dealer [[Richard Secord]] that supplied arms to the Contras. It was ostensibly a private sector operation, but in fact was controlled by the NSC.{{r|Hicks|p=966}} To fund \"the Enterprise\", the Reagan administration was constantly on the look-out for funds that came from outside the U.S. government in order not to explicitly violate the letter of the Boland amendment, though the efforts to find alternative funding for the Contras violated the spirit of the Boland amendment.{{r|Hicks|pages=966\u2013967}} Ironically, military aid to the Contras was reinstated with Congressional consent in October 1986, a month before the scandal broke.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lemoyne |first=James |title=Ortega, Faulting Reagan, Warns of Coming War |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/world/ortega-faulting-reagan-warns-of-coming-war.html |accessdate=15 November 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=19 October 1986 |edition=National |page=1001006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Payton |first=Brenda |title=Is U.S. Backing Contras with Drug Funds? |work=Oakland Tribune |date=4 April 1988}}</ref>\n\n==Arms sales to Iran==\n{{See also|Brokers of Death arms case|Israel's role in the Iran\u2013Iraq war}}\nAs reported in ''The New York Times'' in 1991, \"continuing allegations that Reagan campaign officials made a deal with the Iranian Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the fall of 1980\" led to \"limited investigations.\" However \"limited,\" those investigations established that \"Soon after taking office in 1981, the Reagan Administration secretly and abruptly changed United States policy.\" Secret Israeli arms sales and shipments to Iran began in that year, even as, in public, \"the Reagan Administration\" presented a different face, and \"aggressively promoted a public campaign... to stop worldwide transfers of military goods to Iran.\" ''The New York Times'' explains: \"Iran at that time was in dire need of arms and spare parts for its American-made arsenal to defend itself against Iraq, which had attacked it in September 1980,\" while \"Israel [a U.S. ally] was interested in keeping the war between Iran and Iraq going to insure that these two potential enemies remained preoccupied with each other.\" Maj. Gen. Avraham Tamir, a high-ranking Israeli Defense Ministry in 1981, said there was a \"oral agreement\" to allow the sale of \"spare parts\" to Iran. This was based on an \"understanding\" with Secretary [[Alexander Haig]] (which a Haig adviser denied). This account was confirmed by a former senior American diplomat with a few modifications. The diplomat claimed that \"[Ariel] Sharon violated it, and Haig backed away...\".

As disappointed as I may be in some who served me, I'm still the one who must answer to the American people for this behavior.<ref name=\"pbs-speech\"/></blockquote>\n\nFinally, the president acknowledged that his previous assertions that the U.S. did not trade arms for hostages were incorrect:\n<blockquote>A few months ago I told the American people I did not trade arms for hostages. My heart and my best intentions still tell me that's true, but the facts and the evidence tell me it is not. As the Tower board reported, what began as a strategic opening to Iran deteriorated, in its implementation, into trading arms for hostages.

It is unclear exactly what Reagan knew and when, and whether the arms sales were motivated by his desire to save the U.S. hostages.

After Iranian students stormed the American embassy in Tehran in November 1979 and took 52 Americans hostage, U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]] imposed an [[arms embargo]] on Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} After [[Iran\u2013Iraq War|Iraq invaded Iran]] in September 1980, Iran desperately needed weapons and spare parts for its current weapons. After Ronald Reagan took office as President on 20 January 1981, he vowed to continue Carter's policy of blocking arms sales to Iran on the grounds that Iran supported terrorism.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nA group of senior Reagan administration officials in the Senior Interdepartmental Group conducted a secret study on 21 July 1981, and concluded that the arms embargo was ineffective because Iran could always buy arms and spare parts for its American weapons elsewhere, while at the same time the arms embargo opened the door for Iran to fall into the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] as the Kremlin could sell Iran weapons if the United States would not.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} The conclusion was that the United States should start selling Iran arms as soon as it was politically possible to keep Iran from falling into the Soviet sphere of influence.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} At the same time, the openly declared goal of Ayatollah Khomeini to export his Islamic revolution all over the Middle East and overthrow the governments of Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|other states around the Persian Gulf]] led to the Americans perceiving Khomeini as a major threat to the United States.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nIn the spring of 1983, the United States launched [[Operation Staunch]], a wide-ranging diplomatic effort to persuade other nations all over the world not to sell arms or spare parts for weapons to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} At least part of the reason the Iran\u2013Contra affair proved so humiliating for the United States when the story first broke in November 1986 that the US was selling arms to Iran was that American diplomats, as part of Operation Staunch had, from the spring of 1983 on, been lecturing other nations about how morally wrong it was to sell arms to the Islamic Republic of Iran and applying strong pressure to prevent these arms sales to Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}}\n\nAt the same time that the American government was considering their options on selling arms to Iran, [[Contras|Contra]] militants based in [[Honduras]] were waging a guerrilla war to topple the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] (FSLN) revolutionary government of [[Nicaragua]].

Funding ran out for the Contras by July 1984, and in October a total ban was placed in effect. The second Boland Amendment, in effect from 3 October 1984 to 3 December 1985, stated:<blockquote>During the fiscal year 1985 no funds available to the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department of Defense or any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities may be obligated or expended for the purpose of or which may have the effect of supporting directly or indirectly military or paramilitary operations in Nicaragua by any nation, organization, group, movement, or individual.{{r|Hicks|p=965}}</blockquote> In violation of the Boland Amendment, senior officials of the Reagan administration continued to secretly arm and train the Contras and provide arms to Iran, an operation they called \"the Enterprise\".<ref name=\"Johnston\">{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/09/us/secord-is-guilty-of-one-charge-in-contra-affair.html |title=Secord Is Guilty Of One Charge In Contra Affair |work=The New York Times |edition=National |page=A00024 |first=David |last=Johnston |accessdate=19 July 2011 |date=9 November 1989}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Corn |first=David |title=Is There Really A 'Secret Team'? |work=The Nation |date=2 July 1988}}</ref> As the Contras were heavily dependent upon U.S. military and financial support, the second Boland amendment threatened to break the Contra movement and led to President Reagan in 1984 to order the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] (NSC) to \"keep the Contras together 'body and soul'\", no matter what Congress voted for.{{r|Hicks|p=965}}\n\nA major legal debate at the center of the Iran\u2013Contra affair concerned the question of whether the NSC was one of the \"any other agency or entity of the United States involved in intelligence activities\" covered by the Boland amendment. The Reagan administration argued it was not, and many in Congress argued that it was.{{r|Hicks|p=965}} The majority of constitutional scholars have asserted the NSC did indeed fall within the purview of the second Boland amendment, though the amendment did not mention the NSC by name.{{r|Hicks|p=966}} The broader constitutional question at stake was the power of Congress versus the power of the presidency. The Reagan administration argued that because the constitution assigned the right to conduct foreign policy to the executive, its efforts to overthrow the government of Nicaragua were a presidential prerogative that Congress had no right to try to halt via the Boland amendments.{{r|Hicks|p=964}} By contrast congressional leaders argued that the constitution had assigned Congress control of the budget, and Congress had every right to use that power not to fund projects like attempting to overthrow the government of Nicaragua that they disapproved of.{{r|Hicks|p=964}} As part of the effort to circumvent the Boland amendment, the NSC established \"the Enterprise\", an arms-smuggling network headed by a retired U.S. Air Force officer turned arms dealer [[Richard Secord]] that supplied arms to the Contras. It was ostensibly a private sector operation, but in fact was controlled by the NSC.{{r|Hicks|p=966}} To fund \"the Enterprise\", the Reagan administration was constantly on the look-out for funds that came from outside the U.S. government in order not to explicitly violate the letter of the Boland amendment, though the efforts to find alternative funding for the Contras violated the spirit of the Boland amendment.{{r|Hicks|pages=966\u2013967}} Ironically, military aid to the Contras was reinstated with Congressional consent in October 1986, a month before the scandal broke.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lemoyne |first=James |title=Ortega, Faulting Reagan, Warns of Coming War |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/world/ortega-faulting-reagan-warns-of-coming-war.html |accessdate=15 November 2018 |work=The New York Times |date=19 October 1986 |edition=National |page=1001006}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Payton |first=Brenda |title=Is U.S. Backing Contras with Drug Funds? |work=Oakland Tribune |date=4 April 1988}}</ref>\n\n==Arms sales to Iran==\n{{See also|Brokers of Death arms case|Israel's role in the Iran\u2013Iraq war}}\nAs reported in ''The New York Times'' in 1991, \"continuing allegations that Reagan campaign officials made a deal with the Iranian Government of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini in the fall of 1980\" led to \"limited investigations.\" However \"limited,\" those investigations established that \"Soon after taking office in 1981, the Reagan Administration secretly and abruptly changed United States policy.\" Secret Israeli arms sales and shipments to Iran began in that year, even as, in public, \"the Reagan Administration\" presented a different face, and \"aggressively promoted a public campaign... to stop worldwide transfers of military goods to Iran.\" ''The New York Times'' explains: \"Iran at that time was in dire need of arms and spare parts for its American-made arsenal to defend itself against Iraq, which had attacked it in September 1980,\" while \"Israel [a U.S. ally] was interested in keeping the war between Iran and Iraq going to insure that these two potential enemies remained preoccupied with each other.\" Maj. Gen. Avraham Tamir, a high-ranking Israeli Defense Ministry in 1981, said there was a \"oral agreement\" to allow the sale of \"spare parts\" to Iran. This was based on an \"understanding\" with Secretary [[Alexander Haig]] (which a Haig adviser denied). This account was confirmed by a former senior American diplomat with a few modifications. The diplomat claimed that \"[Ariel] Sharon violated it, and Haig backed away...\". A former \"high-level\" CIA official who saw the reports of arms sales to Iran by Israel in the early 1980's estimated that the total was about 2 billion a year. But also said that \"The degree to which it was sanctioned I don't know.\"<ref name=\"israel-iran\" />\n\nOn 17 June 1985, National Security Adviser [[Robert McFarlane]] wrote a National Security Decision Directive which called for the United States to begin a rapprochement with the Islamic Republic of Iran.{{r|Kornbluh|p=213}} The paper read:\n\n<blockquote>Dynamic political evolution is taking place inside Iran.

The dealings with the Iranians were conducted via the NSC with Admiral Poindexter and his deputy Colonel North, with the American historians Malcolm Byrne and Peter Kornbluh writing that Poindexter granted much power to North \"...who made the most of the situation, often deciding important matters on his own, striking outlandish deals with the Iranians, and acting in the name of the president on issues that were far beyond his competence.
