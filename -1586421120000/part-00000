It was choreographed by Jackson and Vincent Paterson. The short version of the video is six minutes and forty-four seconds long and the full version is nine minutes and thirty-three seconds long. The video begins with a group of men trying to pick up women, but failing. One of the men (Michael Jackson) is told to go home and not to hang around with the other guys anymore. When the man walks home, an elderly man (played by [[Joe Seneca]]), who is sitting on the steps of his house, tells him to just be himself. The man notices a woman, played by model/dancer Tatiana Thumbtzen, walking down the streets alone.\n\nShortly after the man walks out of an alley and stands in front of the woman while she's walking down the street, although she ignores him and keeps walking. He gets her attention by shouting, and then begins singing \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" to her while also dancing. Uninterested, she walks away. He follows her, having been cheered on by his friends to pursue her. Another dance routine begins, involving the man's friends, which leads to the man pursuing the woman throughout the neighborhood. The video ends with the man eventually winning the woman over, and embracing her, while a [[fire hydrant]] sprays out water. The videoclip also features an appearance by his sister [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]] as one of Thumbtzen's friends.\n\nThe music video was released on October 31, 1987,<ref>{{cite web|title= Michael Jackson \u2013 The way you make me feel |website= [[Internet Movie Database]] |url= http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=14144 |accessdate= January 30, 2014}}</ref> and received one nomination at the [[1988 MTV Video Music Awards|1988 MTV Video Music Awards Ceremony]].<ref name=\"MTV\"/> The video, alongside Jackson's '\"Bad\" video, was nominated for Best Choreography, but lost to Jackson's [[Janet Jackson|younger sister Janet]]'s video \"[[The Pleasure Principle (song)|The Pleasure Principle]]\".<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web|title= MTV Video Music Awards \u2013 1988 |publisher= [[MTV]] |url= http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1988/ |accessdate= March 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe music video was included on the video albums: ''[[Video Greatest Hits \u2013 HIStory]]'' (long version on DVD and short version on VHS), ''[[Number Ones (video)|Number Ones]]'' (short version), ''[[Michael Jackson's Vision]]'' (long version) and the Target version DVD of ''[[Bad 25]]'' (long version).\n\nThe introduction of the full version of the video also samples the [[Roy Ayers]] 1985 song \"Hot\" (written by Binky Brice, Philip Hunter Field and James Mtume)<ref>{{cite web|title= Roy Ayers \u2013 Hot |website= [[AllMusic]] |accessdate= February 4, 2018 |url= https://www.allmusic.com/song/hot-mt0043624056}}</ref> from his ''You Might Be Surprised'' album.\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Michaeljacksonphoto drewcohen 2.JPG|thumb|alt=Five males standing next to each other.

The video begins with a group of men trying to pick up women, but failing. One of the men (Michael Jackson) is told to go home and not to hang around with the other guys anymore. When the man walks home, an elderly man (played by [[Joe Seneca]]), who is sitting on the steps of his house, tells him to just be himself. The man notices a woman, played by model/dancer Tatiana Thumbtzen, walking down the streets alone.\n\nShortly after the man walks out of an alley and stands in front of the woman while she's walking down the street, although she ignores him and keeps walking. He gets her attention by shouting, and then begins singing \"The Way You Make Me Feel\" to her while also dancing. Uninterested, she walks away. He follows her, having been cheered on by his friends to pursue her. Another dance routine begins, involving the man's friends, which leads to the man pursuing the woman throughout the neighborhood. The video ends with the man eventually winning the woman over, and embracing her, while a [[fire hydrant]] sprays out water. The videoclip also features an appearance by his sister [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]] as one of Thumbtzen's friends.\n\nThe music video was released on October 31, 1987,<ref>{{cite web|title= Michael Jackson \u2013 The way you make me feel |website= [[Internet Movie Database]] |url= http://www.mvdbase.com/video.php?id=14144 |accessdate= January 30, 2014}}</ref> and received one nomination at the [[1988 MTV Video Music Awards|1988 MTV Video Music Awards Ceremony]].<ref name=\"MTV\"/> The video, alongside Jackson's '\"Bad\" video, was nominated for Best Choreography, but lost to Jackson's [[Janet Jackson|younger sister Janet]]'s video \"[[The Pleasure Principle (song)|The Pleasure Principle]]\".<ref name=\"MTV\">{{cite web|title= MTV Video Music Awards \u2013 1988 |publisher= [[MTV]] |url= http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1988/ |accessdate= March 3, 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe music video was included on the video albums: ''[[Video Greatest Hits \u2013 HIStory]]'' (long version on DVD and short version on VHS), ''[[Number Ones (video)|Number Ones]]'' (short version), ''[[Michael Jackson's Vision]]'' (long version) and the Target version DVD of ''[[Bad 25]]'' (long version).\n\nThe introduction of the full version of the video also samples the [[Roy Ayers]] 1985 song \"Hot\" (written by Binky Brice, Philip Hunter Field and James Mtume)<ref>{{cite web|title= Roy Ayers \u2013 Hot |website= [[AllMusic]] |accessdate= February 4, 2018 |url= https://www.allmusic.com/song/hot-mt0043624056}}</ref> from his ''You Might Be Surprised'' album.\n\n==Live performances==\n[[File:Michaeljacksonphoto drewcohen 2.JPG|thumb|alt=Five males standing next to each other.

His interest in psychology developed at an early age. Despite problems posed by the early death of his father \u2013 leaving him with a mother and two sisters to care for, and discouragement from his school teachers on account of his [[dyslexia]], he insisted on pursuing these interests.\n\nTo support his studies he worked as a teacher, and then as the head teacher, in a boarding school for children with [[physical disabilities]].\n\nIt would appear from archival material now held by [[Pearson PLC]] in London that his interests were in topics that many would today regard as peripheral, such as the psychology of religion, particularly its spiritual/[[parapsychological]] components. Nevertheless, his detailed notes on his [[undergraduate]] laboratory work are remarkable.\n\nBoth his undergraduate and postgraduate studies were formally under the direction of [[Francis Aveling]] at [[King's College London|Kings College]], London, but it would appear that, certainly as a post-graduate he had little direct contact with him, his M.Sc. [[dissertation]] being based on work carried out at the [[Royal Eastern Counties Institution]].\n\nAs an undergraduate, he became friendly with [[Charles Spearman]] and that, shortly after graduation, this relationship led to an introduction to [[Lionel Penrose]] who needed an assistant. Penrose was a [[geneticist]] conducting an investigation of the genetic and environmental origins of mental deficiency. This involved administering the [[Stanford-Binet|Stanford\u2013Binet Intelligence Scales]] tests to all parents and siblings of children identified as mentally deficient by the school system in [[East Anglia]].\nAround this time, he met his wife, [[Mary Elizabeth Wild]], who became a crucial assistant throughout his life.\n\nRaven retired in May 1964.\n\n==Research and theory==\n\nRaven found the tests cumbersome to administer in homes, schools, and workplaces (where, as he commented, there were friends and parents anxious to assist, no separate facilities for testing, and often a great deal of noise) and the results impossible to interpret because so many different things were composited together.\n\nAs a student of Spearman\u2019s, he concluded that what was needed was a test that was theoretically based (cf. Spearman\u2019s critique of the Terman-Merrill and [[Moray House]] Tests mentioned in the Wikipedia [[Charles Spearman|Charles Spearmen]] entry) and easy to administer and score.\n\nAccordingly, he set about developing tests of the two components of ''''' g''''' identified by Spearman \u2013 namely ''eductive'' (meaning making) and ''reproductive'' ability. The former was measured by the [[Progressive Matrices|Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices]] (RPM) tests and the latter by a vocabulary test which later became known as the ''Mill Hill Vocabulary Test'' (MHV). The development of the RPM is described in his Master\u2019s dissertation.<ref>Raven, J. C. (1936). ''Mental Tests Used in Genetic Studies: The Performances of Related Individuals in Tests Mainly Educative and Mainly Reproductive''. M.Sc. [[Thesis]], [[University of London]].</ref> Significantly, this does not mainly consist of the kind of literature review one would normally expect but a specification of the operational criteria to be met by the, as yet non-existent, test. He and his wife, with the support of a grant from the [[Charles Darwin Trust|Darwin Trust]], then set about developing a test to meet these requirements.\n\nIt would appear that Raven was one of the very few people (another was [[Guttman|Louis Guttman]]) who appreciated the importance of developing tests which yielded something approaching an interval scale (although that term was not the stated objective of either author). Among other things, this meant that the sequence of item difficulties must be the same for persons of all levels of ability. In order to demonstrate this \u2026 and identify those items which needed to be modified or rejected \u2026 Raven plotted what have since become known in [[Item Response Theory]] terminology as ''Item Characteristic Curves''. (When [[Georg Rasch]] appeared on the scene in the late 1950s and developed a mathematical model for doing this he tested it on the RPM and was satisfied when it worked!)\n\nThe first versions of what were later termed the ''[[Colored Progressive Matrices]]'' (CPM) (designed to spread the scores of the less able).and the ''Standard Progressive Matrices '' (SPM) were published in 1938.\n\nThe SPM came into its own with the advent of the Second World War. High levels of illiteracy and huge numbers to be tested rendered the use of most other tests unfeasible. After some validation exercises had been conducted, a special 20 minute version of the SPM was produced for the military. This had the items arranged in a single order of difficulty instead of the usual cyclical presentation. The absence of any dependence on language facilitated the diffusion of the tests into military systems throughout the world. (One sees the same requirement for language independence in such places as the mines of South Africa today. Again, there are many prospective entrants speaking many languages \u2013 all differing from that of the test administrator \u2013 and the question of whether the test has the same meaning in these different groups becomes serious.)\n\nAlthough no further experimental work was pursued with a view to implementing Spearman\u2019s injunction to better understand the nature of eductive ability, the Ravens <ref>Raven, J., Raven, J.

Raven\u2019s historical career: After working on various research grants, he was, in 1944, offered a post as Director of Psychological Research at the Crichton Royal (mental) Hospital in Dumfries, Scotland. Two things were remarkable about the terms of reference Raven negotiated for this appointment: First that it should be a part-time one so that he could focus on topics of his own choice without having to negotiate institutional approval. Second, the terms of reference for the Department were that it should largely focus on studies of the normal in order that these might throw light on the abnormal. (It may be thought that this was hardly necessary because are not the journals full of such studies? Indeed, not. Firstly, most of the studies are based on captive populations of students [which limits their generalisability]. And, secondly, the range of topics studied is largely limited to those that can be conducted in literature-oriented laboratory studies, as distinct from problem-oriented studies.)\n\nThroughout his time in this position Raven resisted the notion that psychologists should be engaged in therapy, arguing that such a role relationship implicitly assumes that the therapist knows better than the patient what the patient should be doing. This, Raven argued, discouraged understanding. He maintained that the best way to promote personal re-organisation and growth involved helping people to understand themselves.\n\nOther members of the Department at the Crichton Royal included John Court, Alan Forbes, Graham Foulds, Ralph Hetherington, Joseph Kelly, John Orme, Nancy Thomson, Alastair Weir, and Eunice White.\n\n==Later research with the RPM==\n\nJ .C. Raven\u2019s work with the RPM and MHV has been continued by John Raven, jnr.,<ref>See [http://www.JohnRaven.co.uk his web page]</ref> with the help of dozens of international collaborators.<ref>Raven, J., Raven, J. C., & Court, J. H. (1998, updated 2004). ''Manual for Raven's Progressive Matrices and Vocabulary Scales. Sections 1-7 with 3 Research Supplements''. San Antonio, TX: Harcourt Assessment.</ref>\n\nMuch of this work relates directly to Raven\u2019s original objective in developing his tests, namely to facilitate studies into the genetic and environmental origins of human abilities. Most of the data from many of these studies were originally published in the ''Manual''<ref>Raven, J., Raven, J. C., & Court, J. H. (1998, updated 2004). ''Manual for Raven's Progressive Matrices and Vocabulary Scales. Sections 1-7 with 3 Research Supplements''. San Antonio, TX: Harcourt Assessment.</ref> but later summarised in journals.<ref>e.g. Raven, J. (2000). The Raven\u2019s Progressive Matrices: Change and stability over culture and time. ''Cognitive Psychology, 41'', 1-48. and Raven, J., & Raven, J. (Eds.). (2008). ''Uses and Abuses of Intelligence: Studies Advancing Spearman and Raven\u2019s Quest for Non-Arbitrary Metrics''. Unionville, New York: Royal Fireworks Press; Edinburgh, Scotland: Competency Motivation Project; Budapest, Hungary: EDGE 2000; Cluj Napoca, Romania: Romanian Psychological Testing Services SRL.</ref>\n\nHowever, two strands of work merit special mention.\n\nOne is [[Jim Flynn (academic)|Jim Flynn]]'s now well known work, based on data collected in the course of mass testing of military conscripts with the SPM in many countries over many generations, confirming dramatic intergenerational increases (similar to the equally well-known but commonly overlooked increases in height and longevity) in psychological test scores. While this work reveals a massive impact ''of the environment'' on these scores, the causes of this increase are as hard to elucidate as those that have produced the previously mentioned increases in height and life expectancy. For example, one of the things that the mass of cross-cultural data accumulated with the RPM shows is that the favourite explanations proffered by psychologists and sociologists \u2013 improved living conditions, access to TV, education, family size, diet, ethnicity, calligraphy, test-sophistication \u2013 individually have relatively little effect.\n\nThe other work meriting special mention is that conducted by the [[Minnesota Twin Family Study]]. This placed previous estimates of the heritability of many psychological characteristics \u2013 including such things as religiosity and the happiness set point as well as RPM scores \u2013 beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nBut the juxtaposition of these two great studies here underlines something which few have noted, but which Raven reiterated throughout his life namely that high heritability does '' not'' imply low mutability.

While this work reveals a massive impact ''of the environment'' on these scores, the causes of this increase are as hard to elucidate as those that have produced the previously mentioned increases in height and life expectancy. For example, one of the things that the mass of cross-cultural data accumulated with the RPM shows is that the favourite explanations proffered by psychologists and sociologists \u2013 improved living conditions, access to TV, education, family size, diet, ethnicity, calligraphy, test-sophistication \u2013 individually have relatively little effect.\n\nThe other work meriting special mention is that conducted by the [[Minnesota Twin Family Study]]. This placed previous estimates of the heritability of many psychological characteristics \u2013 including such things as religiosity and the happiness set point as well as RPM scores \u2013 beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nBut the juxtaposition of these two great studies here underlines something which few have noted, but which Raven reiterated throughout his life namely that high heritability does '' not'' imply low mutability.

After the adoption of the Commonwealth's new constitution in 1851, he was again selected by legislators to the reorganized court.\n\nDaniel was a fierce proponent of slavery, and authored the 1858 decision in Bailey v. Poindexter's Estate, which voided a manumission provision in a will because it gave slaves a choice which he and three other justices found them incapable of making. He served in this position until 1865.\n<ref>Paul Finkelman, The law of slavery and Bondage: a casebook(NYU)p.132</ref>\n\n==Death and legacy==\nDaniel died in [[Farmville, Virginia]] and is buried at the Old City cemetery in Lynchburg.<ref>findagrave.com</ref>\n\nHe had married twice, to Sarah Ann Warwick, who died after the birth of their daughter Sarah Ann Warwick Halsey (1845-1918), and then to heiress Elizabeth Hannah Cabell (1811-1892). His son [[John Warwick Daniel]] (1842-1910), became known as the \"Lame Lion of Lynchburg\" due to his disability incurred as a Confederate soldier, and would continue the family's political accomplishments as well as promote the Confederate \"Lost cause\".\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Daniel, William}}\n[[Category:1806 births]]\n[[Category:1873 deaths]]\n[[Category:Virginia Supreme Court justices]]\n[[Category:Members of the Virginia House of Delegates]]\n[[Category:Virginia lawyers]]\n[[Category:Hampden\u2013Sydney College alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Virginia alumni]]\n[[Category:People from Cumberland County, Virginia]]\n[[Category:Virginia Democrats]]\n\n\n{{Virginia-politician-stub}}\n[[Category:19th-century American politicians]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBiography:Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 1827\u201428 \u2192 1827\u201328", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Daniel_(judge)"}
