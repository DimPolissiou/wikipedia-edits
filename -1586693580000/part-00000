Despite marginal early success in his literary career, the popularity of his work gradually diminished over the second and third decades of the 20th century, making it increasingly difficult for him to support himself through writing. He eventually suffered a nervous breakdown and spent the remainder of his life in sanatoriums, taking frequent long walks.\n\nA revival of interest in his work arose when, in the late 20th century and early 2000s, his writings from the Pencil Zone, also known as ''Bleistiftgebiet'' or \"the Microscripts\", which had been written in a coded, microscopically tiny hand on scraps of paper collected while in a Waldau sanatorium, were finally deciphered, translated, and published.<ref name=\"[[Rivka Galchen]]\">{{cite news|last=Galchen|first=Rivka|title=From the Pencil Zone: Robert Walser's Masterworklets|newspaper=Harper's Magazine|date=May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kunkel|first=Benjamin|title=Still Small Voice: The Fiction of Robert Walser|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/08/06/070806crbo_books_kunkel?currentPage=all|accessdate=2 March 2014|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=6 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lerner|first=Ben|title=Robert Walser's Disappearing Acts|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/09/robert-walser-disappearing-acts.html|accessdate=2 March 2014|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=3 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Life and work==\n\n===1878\u20131897===\nWalser was born into a family with many children. His brother [[Karl Walser]] became a well-known [[Scenic design|stage designer]] and [[Painting|painter]]. Walser grew up in [[Biel]], Switzerland, on the [[language border]] between the German- and [[French language|French]]-speaking cantons of Switzerland, and grew up speaking both languages. He attended primary school and [[Gymnasium (school)|progymnasium]], which he had to leave before the final exam when his family could no longer bear the cost. From his early years on, he was an enthusiastic theatre-goer; his favourite play was ''[[Die R\u00e4uber|The Robbers]]'' by [[Friedrich Schiller]]. There is a [[watercolor painting]] that shows Walser as Karl Moor, the protagonist of that play.\n\nFrom 1892 to 1895, Walser served an apprenticeship at the Bernische Kantonalbank in Biel. Afterwards he worked for a short time in [[Basel]]. Walser's mother, who was \"emotionally disturbed\", died in 1894 after being under medical care for a long period.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1895, Walser went to [[Stuttgart]] where his brother Karl lived. He was an office worker at the Deutsche Verlagsanstalt and at the Cotta'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung;  he also tried, without success, to become an actor. On foot, he returned to Switzerland where he registered in 1896 as a [[Z\u00fcrich]] resident. In the following years, he often worked as a \"Kommis\", an office clerk, but irregularly and in many different places. As a result, he was one of the first Swiss writers to introduce into literature a description of the life of a salaried employee.\n\n===1898\u20131912===\nIn 1898, the influential critic Joseph Victor Widmann published a series of poems by Walser in the [[Bern]]ese newspaper ''[[Der Bund]]''. This came to the attention of [[Franz Blei]], and he introduced Walser to the [[Art Nouveau]] people around the magazine ''[[Die Insel]]'', including [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Max Dauthendey]] and [[Otto Julius Bierbaum]]. Numerous short stories and poems by Walser appeared in ''Die Insel.''\n\nUntil 1905, Walser lived mainly in Z\u00fcrich, though he often changed lodgings and also lived for a time in [[Thun]], [[Solothurn]], [[Winterthur]] and [[Munich]]. In 1903, he fulfilled his military service obligation and, beginning that summer, was the \"aide\" of an engineer and inventor in [[W\u00e4denswil]] near Z\u00fcrich. This episode became the basis of his 1908 novel ''Der Geh\u00fclfe'' (''The Assistant''). In 1904, his first book, ''Fritz Kochers Aufs\u00e4tze'' (Fritz Kocher's Essays), appeared in the ''Insel Verlag''.\n{{quote box\n| width  = 20em\n| align  = left\n| quote  = Was isch jetz f\u00fcr Zit?

The theme of serving would characterize his work in the following years, especially in the novel ''[[Jakob von Gunten]]'' (1909). In 1905, he went to live in [[Berlin]], where his brother Karl Walser, who was working as a theater painter, introduced him to other figures in literature, publishing, and the theater. Occasionally, Walser worked as secretary for the artists' corporation [[Berlin Secession|Berliner Secession]].\n\nIn Berlin, Walser wrote the novels ''Geschwister Tanner'', ''Der Geh\u00fclfe'' and ''Jakob von Gunten''. They were issued by the publishing house of [[Bruno Cassirer]], where [[Christian Morgenstern]] worked as editor. Apart from the novels, he wrote many short stories, sketching popular bars from the point of view of a poor [[Fl\u00e2neur|\"flaneur\"]] in a very playful and subjective language. There was a very positive echo to his writings. [[Robert Musil]] and [[Kurt Tucholsky]], among others, stated their admiration for Walser's prose, and authors like [[Hermann Hesse]] and [[Franz Kafka]] counted him among their favorite writers.\n\nWalser published numerous short stories in newspapers and magazines, many for instance in the ''Schaub\u00fchne.'' They became his trademark. The larger part of his work is composed of short stories \u2013 literary sketches that elude a ready categorization. Selections of these short stories were published in the volumes ''Aufs\u00e4tze'' (1913) and ''Geschichten'' (1914).\n\n===1913\u20131929===\nIn 1913, Walser returned to Switzerland. He lived for a short time with his sister Lisa in the mental home in [[Bellelay]], where she worked as a teacher. There, he got to know Lisa Mermet, a washer-woman with whom he developed a close friendship. After a short stay with his father in Biel, he went to live in a mansard in the Biel hotel ''Blaues Kreuz''. In 1914, his father died.\n\nIn Biel, Walser wrote a number of shorter stories that appeared in newspapers and magazines in Germany and Switzerland and selections of which were published in ''Der Spaziergang'' (1917), ''Prosast\u00fccke'' (1917), ''Poetenleben'' (1918), ''Seeland'' (1919) and ''Die Rose'' (1925). Walser, who had always been an enthusiastic wanderer, began to take extended walks, often by night. In his stories from that period, texts written from the point of view of a wanderer walking through unfamiliar neighborhoods alternate with playful essays on writers and artists.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Walser repeatedly had to go into military service. At the end of 1916, his brother Ernst died after a time of mental illness in the Waldau mental home. In 1919, Walser's brother Hermann, geography professor in Bern, committed suicide. Walser himself became isolated in that time, when there was almost no communication with Germany because of the war. Even though he worked hard, he could barely support himself as a freelance writer. At the beginning of 1921, he moved to [[Bern]] in order to work at the public record office. He often changed lodgings and lived a very solitary life.\n\nDuring his time in Bern, Walser's style became more radical. In a more and more condensed form, he wrote \"micrograms\" (\"Mikrogramme\"), called thus because of his minuscule pencil hand that is very difficult to decipher. He wrote poems, prose, dramolettes and novels, including ''The Robber'' (''Der R\u00e4uber''). In these texts, his playful, subjective style moved toward a higher abstraction. Many texts of that time work on multiple levels \u2013 they can be read as naive-playful [[feuilleton]]s or as highly complex montages full of allusions. Walser absorbed influences from serious literature as well as from [[formula fiction]] and retold, for example, the plot of a pulp novel in a way that the original (the title of which he never revealed) was unrecognizable. Much of his work was written during these very productive years in Bern.\n\n===1929\u20131956===\nIn the beginning of 1929, Walser, who had suffered from anxieties and hallucinations for quite some time, went to the Bernese mental home Waldau, after a mental breakdown, at his sister Fani's urging. In his medical records it says: \"The patient confessed hearing voices.\" Therefore, this can hardly be called a voluntary commitment. He was eventually diagnosed with [[catatonic schizophrenia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Partl|first=S.|last2=Pfuhlmann|first2=B.|last3=Jabs|first3=B.|last4=St\u00f6ber|first4=G.|date=2011-01-01|title=[\"My disease is one of the mind and difficult to define\": Robert Walser (1879\u20131956) and his mental illness]|journal=Der Nervenarzt|volume=82|issue=1|pages=67\u201378|doi=10.1007/s00115-009-2914-y|issn=1433-0407|pmid=21274695}}</ref> While he was in the mental home, his state of mind quickly returned to normal, and he went on writing and publishing. More and more, he used the way of writing he called the \"pencil method\": he wrote poems and prose in a diminutive [[S\u00fctterlin]] hand, the letters of which measured about a millimeter of height by the end of that very productive phase. Werner Morlang and Bernhard Echte were the first ones who attempted to decipher these writings. In the 1990s, they published a six-volume edition, ''Aus dem Bleistiftgebiet'' ('From the Pencil Zone'). Only when Walser was, against his will, moved to the sanatorium of [[Herisau]] in his home canton of [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]], did he quit writing, later telling Carl Seelig, \"I am not here to write, but to be mad.\" \n\nIn 1936, his admirer [[Carl Seelig]] began to visit him. He later wrote a book, ''Wanderungen mit Robert Walser'', about their talks. Seelig tried to revive interest in Walser's work by re-issuing some of his writings. After the death of Walser's brother Karl in 1943 and of his sister Lisa in 1944, Seelig became Walser's legal guardian. Though free of outward signs of mental illness for a long time, Walser was crotchety and repeatedly refused to leave the sanatorium.\n\nIn 1955, Walser's ''Der Spaziergang'' (''The Walk'') was translated into English by [[Christopher Middleton (poet)|Christopher Middleton]]; it was the first English translation of his writing and the only one that would appear during his lifetime. Upon learning of Middleton's translation, Walser, who had fallen out of the public eye, responded by musing \"Well, look at that.\"<ref>{{cite book|last2=Bernofsky|first2=Susan|title=The Walk|year=2012|publisher=New Directions|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8112-1992-1|pages=89|author1=Robert Walser}}</ref>\n\nWalser loved long, lonely walks. On 25 December 1956 he was found, dead of a heart attack, in a field of snow near the asylum. The photographs of the dead walker in the snow are almost eerily reminiscent of a similar image of a dead man in the snow in Walser's first novel, ''Geschwister Tanner''.\n\n==Writings and reception==\nToday, Walser's texts, completely re-edited since the 1970s, are regarded as among the most important writings of literary [[modernism]]. In his writing, he made use of elements of [[Swiss German]] in a charming and original manner, while very personal observations are interwoven with ''texts about texts''; that is, with contemplations and variations of other literary works, in which Walser often mixes pulp fiction with high literature.\n\nWalser, who never belonged to a literary school or group, perhaps with the exception of the circle around the magazine ''Die Insel'' in his youth, was a notable and often published writer before World War I and into the 1920s. After the second half of the latter decade, he was rapidly forgotten, in spite of Carl Seelig's editions, which appeared almost exclusively in Switzerland but received little attention.\n\nWalser was rediscovered only in the 1970s, even though famous German writers such as [[Christian Morgenstern]], Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin, [[Thomas Bernhard]] and Hermann Hesse were among his great admirers. Since then, almost all his writings have become accessible through an extensive republication of his entire body of work. He has exerted a considerable influence on various contemporary German writers, including [[Ror Wolf]], [[Peter Handke]], [[W. G. Sebald]], and [[Max Goldt]]. In 2004, Spanish writer [[Enrique Vila-Matas]] published a novel entitled ''Doctor Pasavento'' about Walser, his stay on Herisau and the wish to disappear. In 2007, [[Serbia|Serbian]] writer [[Vojislav V. Jovanovi\u0107]] published a book of prose named ''Story for Robert Walser'' inspired by the life and work of Robert Walser. In 2012, ''A Little Ramble: In the Spirit of Robert Walser''<ref>{{Cite book|title=A little ramble : in the spirit of Robert Walser : inspired by a series of exhibitions at the Donald Young Gallery with Peter Fischli [and others]|last=Walser|first=Robert|publisher=New Directions|others=Fischli, Peter., Middleton, Christopher|year=2012|isbn=9780811220996|location=New York|pages=|oclc=804144951}}</ref>, a series of artistic responses to Walser's work was published, including work by [[Moyra Davey]], [[Thomas Sch\u00fctte]], [[Tacita Dean]] and [[Mark Wallinger]].\n\n== Robert Walser Center ==\nThe Robert Walser Center, which was officially established in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]], in 2009, is dedicated to [[Robert Walser (writer)|Robert Walser]] and the first patron of Walser\u2019s work and legacy, [[Carl Seelig]]. Its purpose is to promulgate Walser\u2019s life and work as well as to facilitate scholarly research. The Center is open to both experts and the general public and includes an extensive archive, a research library, temporary exhibition space, and two rooms with several workstations are also available. The Center furthermore develops and organizes exhibitions, events, conferences, workshops, publications, and special editions. The translation of Robert Walser\u2019s works, which the Center both encourages and supports, also represents a key focus. In order to fully meet its objectives and responsibilities as a center of excellence, it often collaborates on certain projects with local, national, and international partners as well as universities, schools, theaters, museums, archives, translators, editors, and publishers.\n\n==Works==\n\n===German===\n*''Der Teich'', 1902, verse drama\n*''Schneewittchen'', 1901, [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]]\n*''Fritz Kochers Aufs\u00e4tze'', 1904 {{ISBN|3-518-37601-2}}\n*''Geschwister Tanner'', 1907 {{ISBN|3-518-39982-9}}\n*''Der Geh\u00fclfe'', 1908 {{ISBN|3-518-37610-1}}\n*''Poetenleben'', 1908 {{ISBN|3-518-01986-4}}\n*''[[Jakob von Gunten]]'', 1909 {{ISBN|3-518-37611-X}}\n*''Gedichte'', 1909\n*''Aufs\u00e4tze'', 1913\n*Geschichten, 1914\n*''Kleine Dichtungen'', 1915 {{ISBN|3-518-37604-7}}\n*''Prosast\u00fccke'', 1917\n*''Der Spaziergang'', 1917 {{ISBN|3-518-37605-5}}\n*''Kleine Prosa'', 1917\n*''Poetenleben'', 1917 {{ISBN|3-518-01986-4}}\n*''Tobold''-Roman, 1918\n*''Kom\u00f6die'', 1919\n*''Seeland'', 1920 {{ISBN|3-518-37607-1}}\n*''Theodor''-Roman, 1921\n*''Die Rose'', 1925 {{ISBN|3-518-37608-X}}\n*''Der R\u00e4uber'', 1925 (ver\u00f6ffentlicht 1978) {{ISBN|3-518-37612-8}}\n*''Felix-Szenen'', 1925\n*''Gro\u00dfe Welt, kleine Welt'', 1937\n*''Dichterbildnisse'', 1947\n*''Dichtungen in Prosa'', 1953\n*''Robert Walser \u2013 Briefe'', 1979\n*''S\u00e4mtliche Werke in Einzelausgaben''. 20 Bde.

Despite marginal early success in his literary career, the popularity of his work gradually diminished over the second and third decades of the 20th century, making it increasingly difficult for him to support himself through writing. He eventually suffered a nervous breakdown and spent the remainder of his life in sanatoriums, taking frequent long walks.\n\nA revival of interest in his work arose when, in the late 20th century and early 2000s, his writings from the Pencil Zone, also known as ''Bleistiftgebiet'' or \"the Microscripts\", which had been written in a coded, microscopically tiny hand on scraps of paper collected while in a Waldau sanatorium, were finally deciphered, translated, and published.<ref name=\"[[Rivka Galchen]]\">{{cite news|last=Galchen|first=Rivka|title=From the Pencil Zone: Robert Walser's Masterworklets|newspaper=Harper's Magazine|date=May 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kunkel|first=Benjamin|title=Still Small Voice: The Fiction of Robert Walser|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/books/2007/08/06/070806crbo_books_kunkel?currentPage=all|accessdate=2 March 2014|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=6 August 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lerner|first=Ben|title=Robert Walser's Disappearing Acts|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2013/09/robert-walser-disappearing-acts.html|accessdate=2 March 2014|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=3 September 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Life and work==\n\n===1878\u20131897===\nWalser was born into a family with many children. His brother [[Karl Walser]] became a well-known [[Scenic design|stage designer]] and [[Painting|painter]]. Walser grew up in [[Biel]], Switzerland, on the [[language border]] between the German- and [[French language|French]]-speaking cantons of Switzerland, and grew up speaking both languages. He attended primary school and [[Gymnasium (school)|progymnasium]], which he had to leave before the final exam when his family could no longer bear the cost. From his early years on, he was an enthusiastic theatre-goer; his favourite play was ''[[Die R\u00e4uber|The Robbers]]'' by [[Friedrich Schiller]]. There is a [[watercolor painting]] that shows Walser as Karl Moor, the protagonist of that play.\n\nFrom 1892 to 1895, Walser served an apprenticeship at the Bernische Kantonalbank in Biel. Afterwards he worked for a short time in [[Basel]]. Walser's mother, who was \"emotionally disturbed\", died in 1894 after being under medical care for a long period.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} In 1895, Walser went to [[Stuttgart]] where his brother Karl lived. He was an office worker at the Deutsche Verlagsanstalt and at the Cotta'sche Verlagsbuchhandlung;  he also tried, without success, to become an actor. On foot, he returned to Switzerland where he registered in 1896 as a [[Z\u00fcrich]] resident. In the following years, he often worked as a \"Kommis\", an office clerk, but irregularly and in many different places. As a result, he was one of the first Swiss writers to introduce into literature a description of the life of a salaried employee.\n\n===1898\u20131912===\nIn 1898, the influential critic Joseph Victor Widmann published a series of poems by Walser in the [[Bern]]ese newspaper ''[[Der Bund]]''. This came to the attention of [[Franz Blei]], and he introduced Walser to the [[Art Nouveau]] people around the magazine ''[[Die Insel]]'', including [[Frank Wedekind]], [[Max Dauthendey]] and [[Otto Julius Bierbaum]]. Numerous short stories and poems by Walser appeared in ''Die Insel.''\n\nUntil 1905, Walser lived mainly in Z\u00fcrich, though he often changed lodgings and also lived for a time in [[Thun]], [[Solothurn]], [[Winterthur]] and [[Munich]]. In 1903, he fulfilled his military service obligation and, beginning that summer, was the \"aide\" of an engineer and inventor in [[W\u00e4denswil]] near Z\u00fcrich. This episode became the basis of his 1908 novel ''Der Geh\u00fclfe'' (''The Assistant''). In 1904, his first book, ''Fritz Kochers Aufs\u00e4tze'' (Fritz Kocher's Essays), appeared in the ''Insel Verlag''.\n{{quote box\n| width  = 20em\n| align  = left\n| quote  = Was isch jetz f\u00fcr Zit?

The theme of serving would characterize his work in the following years, especially in the novel ''[[Jakob von Gunten]]'' (1909). In 1905, he went to live in [[Berlin]], where his brother Karl Walser, who was working as a theater painter, introduced him to other figures in literature, publishing, and the theater. Occasionally, Walser worked as secretary for the artists' corporation [[Berlin Secession|Berliner Secession]].\n\nIn Berlin, Walser wrote the novels ''Geschwister Tanner'', ''Der Geh\u00fclfe'' and ''Jakob von Gunten''. They were issued by the publishing house of [[Bruno Cassirer]], where [[Christian Morgenstern]] worked as editor. Apart from the novels, he wrote many short stories, sketching popular bars from the point of view of a poor [[Fl\u00e2neur|\"flaneur\"]] in a very playful and subjective language. There was a very positive echo to his writings. [[Robert Musil]] and [[Kurt Tucholsky]], among others, stated their admiration for Walser's prose, and authors like [[Hermann Hesse]] and [[Franz Kafka]] counted him among their favorite writers.\n\nWalser published numerous short stories in newspapers and magazines, many for instance in the ''Schaub\u00fchne.'' They became his trademark. The larger part of his work is composed of short stories \u2013 literary sketches that elude a ready categorization. Selections of these short stories were published in the volumes ''Aufs\u00e4tze'' (1913) and ''Geschichten'' (1914).\n\n===1913\u20131929===\nIn 1913, Walser returned to Switzerland. He lived for a short time with his sister Lisa in the mental home in [[Bellelay]], where she worked as a teacher. There, he got to know Lisa Mermet, a washer-woman with whom he developed a close friendship. After a short stay with his father in Biel, he went to live in a mansard in the Biel hotel ''Blaues Kreuz''. In 1914, his father died.\n\nIn Biel, Walser wrote a number of shorter stories that appeared in newspapers and magazines in Germany and Switzerland and selections of which were published in ''Der Spaziergang'' (1917), ''Prosast\u00fccke'' (1917), ''Poetenleben'' (1918), ''Seeland'' (1919) and ''Die Rose'' (1925). Walser, who had always been an enthusiastic wanderer, began to take extended walks, often by night. In his stories from that period, texts written from the point of view of a wanderer walking through unfamiliar neighborhoods alternate with playful essays on writers and artists.\n\nDuring [[World War I]], Walser repeatedly had to go into military service. At the end of 1916, his brother Ernst died after a time of mental illness in the Waldau mental home. In 1919, Walser's brother Hermann, geography professor in Bern, committed suicide. Walser himself became isolated in that time, when there was almost no communication with Germany because of the war. Even though he worked hard, he could barely support himself as a freelance writer. At the beginning of 1921, he moved to [[Bern]] in order to work at the public record office. He often changed lodgings and lived a very solitary life.\n\nDuring his time in Bern, Walser's style became more radical. In a more and more condensed form, he wrote \"micrograms\" (\"Mikrogramme\"), called thus because of his minuscule pencil hand that is very difficult to decipher. He wrote poems, prose, dramolettes and novels, including ''The Robber'' (''Der R\u00e4uber''). In these texts, his playful, subjective style moved toward a higher abstraction. Many texts of that time work on multiple levels \u2013 they can be read as naive-playful [[feuilleton]]s or as highly complex montages full of allusions. Walser absorbed influences from serious literature as well as from [[formula fiction]] and retold, for example, the plot of a pulp novel in a way that the original (the title of which he never revealed) was unrecognizable. Much of his work was written during these very productive years in Bern.\n\n===1929\u20131956===\nIn the beginning of 1929, Walser, who had suffered from anxieties and hallucinations for quite some time, went to the Bernese mental home Waldau, after a mental breakdown, at his sister Fani's urging. In his medical records it says: \"The patient confessed hearing voices.\" Therefore, this can hardly be called a voluntary commitment. He was eventually diagnosed with [[catatonic schizophrenia]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Partl|first=S.|last2=Pfuhlmann|first2=B.|last3=Jabs|first3=B.|last4=St\u00f6ber|first4=G.|date=2011-01-01|title=[\"My disease is one of the mind and difficult to define\": Robert Walser (1879\u20131956) and his mental illness]|journal=Der Nervenarzt|volume=82|issue=1|pages=67\u201378|doi=10.1007/s00115-009-2914-y|issn=1433-0407|pmid=21274695}}</ref> While he was in the mental home, his state of mind quickly returned to normal, and he went on writing and publishing. More and more, he used the way of writing he called the \"pencil method\": he wrote poems and prose in a diminutive [[S\u00fctterlin]] hand, the letters of which measured about a millimeter of height by the end of that very productive phase. Werner Morlang and Bernhard Echte were the first ones who attempted to decipher these writings. In the 1990s, they published a six-volume edition, ''Aus dem Bleistiftgebiet'' ('From the Pencil Zone'). Only when Walser was, against his will, moved to the sanatorium of [[Herisau]] in his home canton of [[Appenzell Ausserrhoden]], did he quit writing, later telling Carl Seelig, \"I am not here to write, but to be mad.\" \n\nIn 1936, his admirer [[Carl Seelig]] began to visit him. He later wrote a book, ''Wanderungen mit Robert Walser'', about their talks. Seelig tried to revive interest in Walser's work by re-issuing some of his writings. After the death of Walser's brother Karl in 1943 and of his sister Lisa in 1944, Seelig became Walser's legal guardian. Though free of outward signs of mental illness for a long time, Walser was crotchety and repeatedly refused to leave the sanatorium.\n\nIn 1955, Walser's ''Der Spaziergang'' (''The Walk'') was translated into English by [[Christopher Middleton (poet)|Christopher Middleton]]; it was the first English translation of his writing and the only one that would appear during his lifetime. Upon learning of Middleton's translation, Walser, who had fallen out of the public eye, responded by musing \"Well, look at that.\"<ref>{{cite book|last2=Bernofsky|first2=Susan|title=The Walk|year=2012|publisher=New Directions|location=New York|isbn=978-0-8112-1992-1|pages=89|author1=Robert Walser}}</ref>\n\nWalser loved long, lonely walks. On 25 December 1956 he was found, dead of a heart attack, in a field of snow near the asylum. The photographs of the dead walker in the snow are almost eerily reminiscent of a similar image of a dead man in the snow in Walser's first novel, ''Geschwister Tanner''.\n\n==Writings and reception==\nToday, Walser's texts, completely re-edited since the 1970s, are regarded as among the most important writings of literary [[modernism]]. In his writing, he made use of elements of [[Swiss German]] in a charming and original manner, while very personal observations are interwoven with ''texts about texts''; that is, with contemplations and variations of other literary works, in which Walser often mixes pulp fiction with high literature.\n\nWalser, who never belonged to a literary school or group, perhaps with the exception of the circle around the magazine ''Die Insel'' in his youth, was a notable and often published writer before World War I and into the 1920s. After the second half of the latter decade, he was rapidly forgotten, in spite of Carl Seelig's editions, which appeared almost exclusively in Switzerland but received little attention.\n\nWalser was rediscovered only in the 1970s, even though famous German writers such as [[Christian Morgenstern]], Franz Kafka, Walter Benjamin, [[Thomas Bernhard]] and Hermann Hesse were among his great admirers. Since then, almost all his writings have become accessible through an extensive republication of his entire body of work. He has exerted a considerable influence on various contemporary German writers, including [[Ror Wolf]], [[Peter Handke]], [[W. G. Sebald]], and [[Max Goldt]]. In 2004, Spanish writer [[Enrique Vila-Matas]] published a novel entitled ''Doctor Pasavento'' about Walser, his stay on Herisau and the wish to disappear. In 2007, [[Serbia|Serbian]] writer [[Vojislav V. Jovanovi\u0107]] published a book of prose named ''Story for Robert Walser'' inspired by the life and work of Robert Walser. In 2012, ''A Little Ramble: In the Spirit of Robert Walser''<ref>{{Cite book|title=A little ramble : in the spirit of Robert Walser : inspired by a series of exhibitions at the Donald Young Gallery with Peter Fischli [and others]|last=Walser|first=Robert|publisher=New Directions|others=Fischli, Peter., Middleton, Christopher|year=2012|isbn=9780811220996|location=New York|pages=|oclc=804144951}}</ref>, a series of artistic responses to Walser's work was published, including work by [[Moyra Davey]], [[Thomas Sch\u00fctte]], [[Tacita Dean]] and [[Mark Wallinger]].\n\n== Robert Walser Center ==\nThe Robert Walser Center, which was officially established in [[Bern]], [[Switzerland]], in 2009, is dedicated to [[Robert Walser (writer)|Robert Walser]] and the first patron of Walser\u2019s work and legacy, [[Carl Seelig]]. Its purpose is to promulgate Walser\u2019s life and work as well as to facilitate scholarly research. The Center is open to both experts and the general public and includes an extensive archive, a research library, temporary exhibition space, and two rooms with several workstations are also available. The Center furthermore develops and organizes exhibitions, events, conferences, workshops, publications, and special editions. The translation of Robert Walser\u2019s works, which the Center both encourages and supports, also represents a key focus. In order to fully meet its objectives and responsibilities as a center of excellence, it often collaborates on certain projects with local, national, and international partners as well as universities, schools, theaters, museums, archives, translators, editors, and publishers.\n\n==Works==\n\n===German===\n*''Der Teich'', 1902, verse drama\n*''Schneewittchen'', 1901, [[Verse drama and dramatic verse|verse drama]]\n*''Fritz Kochers Aufs\u00e4tze'', 1904 {{ISBN|3-518-37601-2}}\n*''Geschwister Tanner'', 1907 {{ISBN|3-518-39982-9}}\n*''Der Geh\u00fclfe'', 1908 {{ISBN|3-518-37610-1}}\n*''Poetenleben'', 1908 {{ISBN|3-518-01986-4}}\n*''[[Jakob von Gunten]]'', 1909 {{ISBN|3-518-37611-X}}\n*''Gedichte'', 1909\n*''Aufs\u00e4tze'', 1913\n*Geschichten, 1914\n*''Kleine Dichtungen'', 1915 {{ISBN|3-518-37604-7}}\n*''Prosast\u00fccke'', 1917\n*''Der Spaziergang'', 1917 {{ISBN|3-518-37605-5}}\n*''Kleine Prosa'', 1917\n*''Poetenleben'', 1917 {{ISBN|3-518-01986-4}}\n*''Tobold''-Roman, 1918\n*''Kom\u00f6die'', 1919\n*''Seeland'', 1920 {{ISBN|3-518-37607-1}}\n*''Theodor''-Roman, 1921\n*''Die Rose'', 1925 {{ISBN|3-518-37608-X}}\n*''Der R\u00e4uber'', 1925 (ver\u00f6ffentlicht 1978) {{ISBN|3-518-37612-8}}\n*''Felix-Szenen'', 1925\n*''Gro\u00dfe Welt, kleine Welt'', 1937\n*''Dichterbildnisse'', 1947\n*''Dichtungen in Prosa'', 1953\n*''Robert Walser \u2013 Briefe'', 1979\n*''S\u00e4mtliche Werke in Einzelausgaben''. 20 Bde.

In the 16th century, the overtures of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ''[[padroado]]'' to bring the Saint Thomas Christians into [[Latin Rite]] [[Catholicism]] led to the first of several rifts in the community due to Portuguese colonialists, and the establishment of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] and the [[Malankara Church]] factions. Since then, further splits have occurred, and the Saint Thomas Christians are now divided into several factions.\n\nSaint Thomas Christians were administratively under the single native dynastic leadership of an [[Archdeacon]] (a native ecclesiastical head with spiritual and temporal powers, deriving from Greek term arkhidi\u0101konos) and were in communion with the [[Church of the East]], centered in [[Persia]], from at least 496.<ref name=Frykenberg93>Frykenberg, p. 93.</ref><ref>Wilmshurst, ''EO'', 343</ref> The indigenous Church of Malabar/Malankara followed the faith and traditions handed over by the Apostle [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]]. During the 16th century, the Portuguese [[Jesuits]] began deliberate attempts to annex the native Christians to the Catholic Church, and in 1599 they succeeded through the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Resentment against these forceful measures led the majority of the community under the Archdeacon Thomas to swear an oath never to submit to the Portuguese, known as the [[Coonan Cross Oath]], in 1653.  The [[Malankara Church]] consolidated under [[Mar Thoma I]] welcomed [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]], who regularized the canonical ordination of Mar Thoma as a bishop.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dutch East India Company defeated the Portuguese and gained supremacy over the spice trade in Malabar in 1663. The Malankara church used this opportunity to escape from Catholic persecution with the Dutch East India Company's help. At the request of the Malankara Church, the Dutch brought [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]] of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], a bishop of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], in their trading vessel in 1665. Mar Thoma I forged a relationship with the Syriac Orthodox Church and gradually adopted [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac liturgy]] and practices.\n\n\nAs part of the Syriac Orthodox communion, the church uses the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac liturgy]] and is part of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] group of churches. It has dioceses in most parts of [[India]] as well as in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Western Europe]], the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] nations. In 2003 it was estimated that the church has 1,000,000(Inc Knanaya) members globally.<ref name=\"Fahlbusch\">{{Cite book |author1=Fahlbusch, Erwin |author2=Lochman, Jan Milic |author3=Mbiti, John S. |author4=Vischer, Lukas |author5=Bromiley, Geoffrey William | title=The Encyclopedia Of Christianity (Encyclopedia of Christianity) Volume 5 | year=2003 | publisher=Wm.

In the 16th century, the overtures of the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] ''[[padroado]]'' to bring the Saint Thomas Christians into [[Latin Rite]] [[Catholicism]] led to the first of several rifts in the community due to Portuguese colonialists, and the establishment of the [[Syro-Malabar Catholic Church]] and the [[Malankara Church]] factions. Since then, further splits have occurred, and the Saint Thomas Christians are now divided into several factions.\n\nSaint Thomas Christians were administratively under the single native dynastic leadership of an [[Archdeacon]] (a native ecclesiastical head with spiritual and temporal powers, deriving from Greek term arkhidi\u0101konos) and were in communion with the [[Church of the East]], centered in [[Persia]], from at least 496.<ref name=Frykenberg93>Frykenberg, p. 93.</ref><ref>Wilmshurst, ''EO'', 343</ref> The indigenous Church of Malabar/Malankara followed the faith and traditions handed over by the Apostle [[Thomas the Apostle|St. Thomas]]. During the 16th century, the Portuguese [[Jesuits]] began deliberate attempts to annex the native Christians to the Catholic Church, and in 1599 they succeeded through the [[Synod of Diamper]]. Resentment against these forceful measures led the majority of the community under the Archdeacon Thomas to swear an oath never to submit to the Portuguese, known as the [[Coonan Cross Oath]], in 1653.  The [[Malankara Church]] consolidated under [[Mar Thoma I]] welcomed [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]], who regularized the canonical ordination of Mar Thoma as a bishop.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dutch East India Company defeated the Portuguese and gained supremacy over the spice trade in Malabar in 1663. The Malankara church used this opportunity to escape from Catholic persecution with the Dutch East India Company's help. At the request of the Malankara Church, the Dutch brought [[Gregorios Abdal Jaleel]] of [[Jerusalem in Christianity|Jerusalem]], a bishop of the [[Syriac Orthodox Church]], in their trading vessel in 1665. Mar Thoma I forged a relationship with the Syriac Orthodox Church and gradually adopted [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac liturgy]] and practices.\n\n\nAs part of the Syriac Orthodox communion, the church uses the [[West Syriac Rite|West Syriac liturgy]] and is part of the [[Oriental Orthodox]] group of churches. It has dioceses in most parts of [[India]] as well as in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Western Europe]], the [[Persian Gulf]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] nations. In 2003 it was estimated that the church has 1,000,000(Inc Knanaya) members globally.<ref name=\"Fahlbusch\">{{Cite book |author1=Fahlbusch, Erwin |author2=Lochman, Jan Milic |author3=Mbiti, John S. |author4=Vischer, Lukas |author5=Bromiley, Geoffrey William | title=The Encyclopedia Of Christianity (Encyclopedia of Christianity) Volume 5 | year=2003 | publisher=Wm.

The movement that eventually led to the project's cancellation became one of the most significant environmental campaigns in Australian history.\n\nThe dam was proposed for the purpose of generating [[hydroelectricity]]. The resulting new electricity generation capacity would have been {{convert|180|MW}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tasmaniantimes.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/professor-west-reminds-tasmania-that-hydro-past-constrains-future/ |title=Professor West reminds Tasmania that hydro past constrains future |work=Tasmanian Times |date= |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The proposed construction would have subsequently impacted upon the environmentally sensitive [[Franklin River]], which joins the Gordon nearby. During the campaign against the dam, both areas were listed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Area]] register.\n\nThe campaign that followed led to the consolidation of the small green movement that had been born out of the [[non-violent protest]]{{verify source|date=June 2015}} campaign against the building of three dams on [[Lake Pedder]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the five years between the announcement of the dam proposal in 1978 and the axing of the plans in 1983, there was vigorous debate between the pro- and anti-dam lobbies, with large protests from both sides.\n\nIn December 1982, the dam site was occupied by protesters, leading to widespread arrests and greater publicity. The dispute became a federal issue the following March, when a campaign in the national print media, assisted by the pictures of photographer [[Peter Dombrovskis]], helped bring down the government of [[Malcolm Fraser]] at the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 election]]. The new government, under [[Bob Hawke]], had promised to stop the dam from being built. A legal battle between the federal government and [[Tasmanian Government]] followed, resulting in a landmark [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] ruling in the federal government's favour.<ref name=hca/>\n\n== Announcement of the plans ==\n{{Location map+ | Tasmania\n| caption = Original locations of the proposed dams in Tasmania\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Tasmania\n    | label = Gordon below Franklin \n    | position = left\n    | lat_deg = -42.584\n    | lon_deg = 145.732 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Tasmania\n    | label = Dam #2\n    | position = right\n    | lat_deg = -42.376\n    | lon_deg = 145.757 }}\n}}\n\nIn 1978, the Tasmanian [[Hydro Electric Commission]] announced intentions to construct the dam.

It gained support from some sections of the community for generating jobs in an area of the state that was struggling economically. It was suggested that the construction of the dam would assist in bringing industry to Tasmania, on top of the jobs that it would create directly. The initial opinion polls showed around 70% support for the dam.\n\nHowever, the protest movement which had gathered to fight the construction of the [[Lake Pedder]] Dam earlier in the 1970s began to reassemble in response to the announcement. The [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society]] which had formed from the anti-Lake Pedder Dam and South West Tasmania action groups, the [[Tasmanian Conservation Trust]], and the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] began to mount a public interest campaign concerning the river. The photographs of Dombrovskis and his colleague, [[Olegas Truchanas]], attracted significant attention. The campaign generated 30,000 letters of support in a fortnight. A film, ''The Last Wild River'', was shown on Tasmania's two commercial television stations.\n\nIn June 1980, an estimated 10,000 people marched through the streets of Hobart, demanding that the government not proceed with construction. This was the largest rally in the history of the state.<ref>{{Citation| last = Stephen  | first = Sarah  | title = 10th anniversary of the Franklin blockade  | magazine = Green Left Weekly  | issue= 80 | location = Sydney  | date = 18 November 1992  | url= http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/2601 | accessdate = 2011-08-09}}</ref>\n\n== Attempts at compromise ==\nThe [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] state government, under premier [[Doug Lowe (Australian politician)|Doug Lowe]], backed down from the original proposal, and agreed to place the Franklin River in a new [[Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park|Wild Rivers National Park]]. Instead of the original 'Gordon below Franklin' proposal, Lowe now backed an alternative, the 'Gordon above Olga' scheme.<ref>For maps of the proposed schemes see - Thompson, Peter (1981) ''Power In Tasmania'' ACF {{ISBN|0858020645}}  pp.36 noting the potential confusion for which schemes was what -''Integrated'' meant damming the King and Franklin as one, and the Lower Franklin and Oga rivers as the other.  ''Separate'' meant Gordon above the Olga, and The King  and Fraklin dammed the same as in the  Integrated scheme</ref> While this was above the Gordon's junction with the Franklin, it still would have intruded into wilderness quality areas. This compromise did not appease the environmental groups, who maintained a policy of no dams in southwest Tasmania.\n\nIn July, both the pro-dam and anti-dam groups (the former of which also included the union movement) initiated an advertising blitz in Tasmania. The HEC claimed that up to 10,000 potential jobs would be lost if the dam was not built. The conservative dominated Legislative Council then blocked the [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] government's 'Gordon-above-Olga' compromise, instead insisting that they proceed with the original proposal. The two parties could not agree on a solution, which led to a deadlock between the two houses of parliament.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wilderness.org.au/history-franklin-river-campaign-1976-83|title=History of the Franklin River Campaign 1976-83 {{!}} The Wilderness Society|date=2001-06-15|newspaper=The Wilderness Society|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election==\nIn 1981, [[Australian Democrats]] Senator [[Don Chipp]] initiated a Senate inquiry into \"the natural values of south-west Tasmania to Australia and the world\" and \"the federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance\".\n\nFrom early 1981, archaeologists uncovered evidence of human habitation dating from about 15,000 years BP in caves which would be flooded if the dam were to be built. The most significant cave had been rediscovered by [[geomorphology]] student Kevin Kieran in January 1977,<ref name =Griffiths/> and he first named it [[Fraser Cave]] by after the then Prime Minister, [[Malcolm Fraser]], because ''...we were trying to direct the attention of politicians to the area...'''.<ref>[http://www.janesoceania.com/australia_aboriginal_iceage_walktotasmania/index1.htm AUSTRALIA, An Ice Age - Walk to Tasmania]</ref> It was renamed Kutikina in mid-1982, as suggested by the [[Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre]].

In rounded figures, 47% voted in favour of the original Gordon below Franklin scheme, 8% for the compromise Gordon above Olga scheme, and 45% voted informally.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" /> There had been a significant campaign for voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot papers, and in total more than 33% of voters did this; these were initially all counted in the informal vote, but some were later recounted as formal as they also included a valid vote for one of the two dam options.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" />\n\nThe ongoing crisis resulted in the replacement of Lowe as premier by [[Harry Holgate]], a Labor politician who was markedly more supportive of the dam proposals. In response, both Lowe and [[Mary Willey]], another Labor MP, resigned from the party and sat in the parliament as independents. This resulted in the loss of a Labor majority in the lower house. [[Norm Sanders]], an [[Australian Democrats]] MP and anti-dam campaigner, moved a no-confidence motion, and a state election was called for 15 May.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn May 1982 the Holgate Labor government was defeated by the strongly pro-dam Liberal Party under [[Robin Gray (Australian politician)|Robin Gray]]. The new Premier immediately ordered the original plan to go ahead and passed the necessary legislation. Gray attempted to dissuade the federal government from intervening by threatening to secede from the Commonwealth if they did so. The federal government initially declined to intervene in the dispute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== The campaigns broadens ==\nDuring 1982, active membership of anti-dam organisations increased a hundredfold in mainland states. The iconic \"No Dams\" triangle sticker was printed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.australiaforvisitors.com/franklin-gordon-wild-rivers-national-park.html | title=Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park | publisher=Australia for Visitors | date=2005\u20132011 | accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref> Rallies and events were held in cities around Australia.  Bob Brown toured the country raising support for the anti-dam campaign, attempting to convince Liberal Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] to intervene and override the state legislation allowing the dam's construction. British botanist and TV presenter Professor [[David Bellamy]] addressed 5,000{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} people at a Melbourne rally.\n\nBy the end of 1982, any perception that \"greenies\" equated with hippies had been greatly challenged, for example in Sydney, [[Bob Brown]] and Bellamy addressed 500 people at a candle-lit dinner serenaded by string quartet,<ref>The [[The Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]]'s ''Stay In Touch'' column plugged this dinner a couple of days before.</ref><ref>Tim Lamble[?spelling] operated his programmed slide show with dual projectors fading in and out 35mm slides of Tasmanian wilderness photographs, set to recorded music.</ref> ABC's classical music radio station featured a \"Concert for the Franklin\", and electronics entrepreneur [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]] committed to civil disobedience. Many people who had not previously considered conservation issues decided that wilderness was a vote-worthy issue, as evidenced by the following ballot paper write-in campaigns.\n\nIn the federal [[1982 Lowe by-election|Lowe by-election]] in Sydney, March 1982, volunteers<ref>Volunteers were co-opted from the Australian Conservation Foundation by the NSW South West Tasmania Committee.</ref> at every polling booth encouraged voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot paper, and 9% did so.<ref>Scrutineers issued this figure in a press release, suggesting a headline like \"Franklin River comes 3rd in by-election\".

On the same day, the UNESCO committee in Paris was due to list the Tasmanian wild rivers as a World Heritage site. The blockade, at \"Warners Landing\" ({{coord|42|34|7|S|145|41|24|E|type:mountain_region:AU-TAS}}) drew an estimated 2,500 people, from not only Tasmania, but also from interstate and overseas. This resulted in the subsequent proclamation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which covered both the Franklin and Gordon Rivers. However, Tasmania itself was still divided, with a pro-dam rally in [[Hobart]] also attracting around 2,500 people. While the blockade was ongoing, Norm Sanders resigned from the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] to contest a seat in the [[Australian Senate]]. He was replaced in the Assembly by [[Bob Brown]], who had only been released from jail the previous day after spending nineteen days behind bars for his role in the blockade.\n\nThroughout January 1983 around fifty people arrived at the blockade each day. The state government made things difficult for the protesters, passing several laws and enforcing special bail conditions for those arrested. Bulldozers were unloaded at the site from a barge under the protection of police. A total of 1,217 arrests were made, many simply for being present at the blockade. Protesters impeded machinery and occupied sites associated with the construction work. Nearly 500 people were imprisoned for breaking the terms of their bail. This caused an overflow of prisons in the region. British botanist [[David Bellamy]] was jailed, which gave the dispute international attention. The author [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]], after being arrested at the blockade, was placed in the high-security [[HM Prison Risdon|Risdon Prison]] for a night, as there was nowhere else to hold him.\n\nIn February, a Hobart rally against the dam drew approximately 20,000 people. On 1 March, the movement launched a day of action, which they labelled 'G-Day'. 231 people were arrested as a flotilla of boats took to the Gordon River. In Hobart, the Wilderness Society flag was flown above the HEC building.\n\nOn 2 March the Wilderness Society backed the publication of what were then rare full-page colour advertisements in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and Melbourne's ''[[The Age]]'' newspapers of what would soon become an iconic photograph:<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/gateways/archive/63/p08a02.html Pictures Collection: Peter Dombrovskis Wilderness Images], National Library of Australia. \"The photograph made the Franklin River a household word, and became an icon of the environmentalist cause.\"</ref> ''Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River'' by [[Peter Dombrovskis]].

The new [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], [[Bob Hawke]], had vowed to stop the dam from being built,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://envlaw.com.au/tasmanian-dam-case/|title=Environmental Law Australia {{!}}   Tasmanian Dam Case|website=envlaw.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> and the anti-dam vote increased Hawke's majority - some federal Victorian seats were notable for having a strong interest in the issue.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, in Tasmania, the vote went against the national trend and the Liberals held all five seats. Hawke's government first passed regulations under the existing ''National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act'' 1975, and then passed the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983, which prohibited Franklin River dam-related clearing, excavation and building activities that had been authorised by Tasmanian state legislation.\n\nHowever, the Tasmanian government ignored both the federal regulations and legislation and continued to order work on the dam. The issue was brought before the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] with the first day of hearings on 31 May 1983. The government of Tasmania claimed that the federal government had no powers under the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] to pass either the regulations or the legislation. They claimed that as the right to legislate for the environment was not named in the Constitution, and was thus a residual power held by the states, that the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983 was unconstitutional. The federal government, however, claimed (successfully) that they had the right to do so, under the 'external affairs' provision of the Constitution as, by passing legislation blocking the dam's construction, they were fulfilling their responsibilities under an international treaty (the [[UNESCO]] ''Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage'', Australia having signed and ratified that convention and the Franklin River having been listed on it). The Commonwealth government also argued (successfully) that the federal legislation was supported by the constitutional powers of a federal government to pass laws about corporations and about the people of any race (in this case the aboriginal race, whose sacred caves along the Franklin would have been inundated).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe resulting court case became known as [[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]. On 1 July 1983, in a landmark decision, the High Court on circuit in Brisbane ruled by a vote of 4 to 3 in the federal government's favour. Judges Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane were in the majority and justices Wilson and Dawson with Chief Justice Gibbs were in the minority. This ruling gave the federal government the power to legislate on any issue if necessary to enforce an international treaty and has been the subject of controversy ever since. Justice [[Lionel Murphy]] wrote most broadly of the Franklin Dam decision's broader environmental and social implications in terms of the [[UNESCO]] Convention's [[common heritage of humanity]] principle, stating that \"The preservation of the world's heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war...[t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity.\"<ref>Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 46 ALR 625 at 733 and 734.</ref> The High Court ruling ended the dam's construction, and the plans have never been revived.\n\nThe demise of plans for the Franklin Dam also largely ended the building of dams for the generation of hydroelectricity in Australia.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ecogeneration.com.au/news/hydroelectricity_in_australia_past_present_and_future/055974/ |author=Harries, David |title=Hydroelectricity in Australia: past, present and future |date=March 2011 |journal=ecogeneration |publisher=Great Southern Press |accessdate=6 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706183448/http://ecogeneration.com.au/news/hydroelectricity_in_australia_past_present_and_future/055974/ |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, dam-building by the Hydro was not finished. The corporation was still able to construct a 'compromise' power development scheme on the nearby [[King River, Tasmania|King River]] and [[Henty River]] to compensate for the loss of the potential power generation from the Franklin scheme. Further on in time, the [[West Coast Wilderness Railway]] - the reconstruction of the old Mount Lyell Abt Railway between [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]] and Regatta point, was mainly financed by compensation funds allocated to the Tasmanian Government for the \"loss\" of the Franklin River or Gordon River dams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Postscript==\n\nIn April 1983 the Australian Government sent a [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage jet]] and later an [[General Dynamics F-111C|RF-111]],<ref>[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=158 Second \u2018spy\u2019 mission to Tasmania], 08 Apr 1983, Air Power Development Centre,Department of Defence</ref> from the Royal Australian Air Force, to undertake a reconnaissance mission over the dam to gather evidence that the Tasmanian Government was not complying with Federal legislation to stop work.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Lowe, Doug |subject-link=Doug Lowe (Australian politician) |subject2=Brown, Bob |subject-link2=Bob Brown |subject3=Gray, Robin |subject-link3=Robin Gray (Australian politician) |subject4=Holgate, Harry |subject-link4=Harry Holgate |subject5=others |interviewer=Maura Angle |title=We look back at one of Tasmania's most defining periods in history, the Franklin dam dispute |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2003/s890008.htm |type=Interview: Transcript |work=[[Stateline (TV program)|Stateline]] |publisher=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]] |location=[[Tasmania]] |date=27 June 2003 |year= |page= |pages= |access-date=11 July 2015  |quote=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/SENATE/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf Papers on Parliament 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001024544/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf |date=1 October 2009 }} ''\"In preparing the Commonwealth's case for the inevitable High Court challenge by Tasmania, Evans earned the popular title of 'Biggles' for arranging to have Royal Australian Air Force planes fly 'spy flights' over the dam site to collect court evidence.\"'' (p27)</ref> One of the reconnaissance photographs showing the continuing work on the site is displayed at College of Law staff library in the [[Australian National University]].\n\nOn 1 July 2008, former Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] spoke at Hobart's [[Hotel Grand Chancellor, Hobart|Grand Chancellor Hotel]] at a dinner to mark the 25th anniversary of the High Court decision on the [[Tasmanian Dam Case]]. He said the campaign to protect the [[Franklin River]] had important lessons for the struggle against [[global warming]]:\n\n\"...I just want to really round off by saying how relevant, today, is the experience of that time 25 years ago - because we are now faced with unprecedented environmental challenge. The Gordon Below Franklin was, of course, a major issue. But, relatively speaking, it pales into insignificance, against the massive challenge that we as a world are facing now. The very question of survivability is at stake.\n\nAnd as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The [[conservatives]]: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can't do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost [[economic growth]]. You can't do it, you mustn't do it.\n\nWhat's the argument today? No, we now see, at a time where we have a Labor Government in power, which is committed to take all the decisions that need to be taken to meet this historically unparalleled challenge of [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. As we have a government committed to action in that regard, we have the conservatives now playing politics on this issue. \n\nI want to say, I want to plead with the conservatives... Now, the conservatives, what do they go on about? They are always talking about family values... What is the greatest obligation that politicians of every party have towards their families now? To their kids, their grandkids and their kids? It is that we take action to pass on to them a planet which is inhabitable, viable and enjoyable. And we must challenge them, and say 'Are you serious about family values? Are you serious about putting family first? If you are, you have no alternative but to join with government and to join with organisations who are committed to bringing about that result'.\n\nI want to conclude by saying this to you all. We can best celebrate this great occasion, the great achievement of [[Bob Brown]] and those who he led, the great achievement of saving the Franklin. We can best celebrate that occasion, best honour those who worked to achieve that result, if we commit ourselves unequivocally... to persuading our society, to persuade our communities, but most of all to persuade our politicians in all political parties to commit themselves to taking action, here within [[Australia]], and combining to ensure that international action is taken to bring about that situation, which I say that we can pass on to our children, our grandchildren and their children, a planet which is safe, inhabitable and enjoyable.\" <ref>Former PM Bob Hawke.

The movement that eventually led to the project's cancellation became one of the most significant environmental campaigns in Australian history.\n\nThe dam was proposed for the purpose of generating [[hydroelectricity]]. The resulting new electricity generation capacity would have been {{convert|180|MW}}.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://tasmaniantimes.com/index.php?/weblog/comments/professor-west-reminds-tasmania-that-hydro-past-constrains-future/ |title=Professor West reminds Tasmania that hydro past constrains future |work=Tasmanian Times |date= |accessdate=12 August 2010}}</ref> The proposed construction would have subsequently impacted upon the environmentally sensitive [[Franklin River]], which joins the Gordon nearby. During the campaign against the dam, both areas were listed on the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Area]] register.\n\nThe campaign that followed led to the consolidation of the small green movement that had been born out of the [[non-violent protest]]{{verify source|date=June 2015}} campaign against the building of three dams on [[Lake Pedder]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Over the five years between the announcement of the dam proposal in 1978 and the axing of the plans in 1983, there was vigorous debate between the pro- and anti-dam lobbies, with large protests from both sides.\n\nIn December 1982, the dam site was occupied by protesters, leading to widespread arrests and greater publicity. The dispute became a federal issue the following March, when a campaign in the national print media, assisted by the pictures of photographer [[Peter Dombrovskis]], helped bring down the government of [[Malcolm Fraser]] at the [[1983 Australian federal election|1983 election]]. The new government, under [[Bob Hawke]], had promised to stop the dam from being built. A legal battle between the federal government and [[Tasmanian Government]] followed, resulting in a landmark [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] ruling in the federal government's favour.<ref name=hca/>\n\n== Announcement of the plans ==\n{{Location map+ | Tasmania\n| caption = Original locations of the proposed dams in Tasmania\n| relief = 1\n| places =\n  {{Location map~ | Tasmania\n    | label = Gordon below Franklin \n    | position = left\n    | lat_deg = -42.584\n    | lon_deg = 145.732 }}\n  {{Location map~ | Tasmania\n    | label = Dam #2\n    | position = right\n    | lat_deg = -42.376\n    | lon_deg = 145.757 }}\n}}\n\nIn 1978, the Tasmanian [[Hydro Electric Commission]] announced intentions to construct the dam.

It gained support from some sections of the community for generating jobs in an area of the state that was struggling economically. It was suggested that the construction of the dam would assist in bringing industry to Tasmania, on top of the jobs that it would create directly. The initial opinion polls showed around 70% support for the dam.\n\nHowever, the protest movement which had gathered to fight the construction of the [[Lake Pedder]] Dam earlier in the 1970s began to reassemble in response to the announcement. The [[Tasmanian Wilderness Society]] which had formed from the anti-Lake Pedder Dam and South West Tasmania action groups, the [[Tasmanian Conservation Trust]], and the [[Australian Conservation Foundation]] began to mount a public interest campaign concerning the river. The photographs of Dombrovskis and his colleague, [[Olegas Truchanas]], attracted significant attention. The campaign generated 30,000 letters of support in a fortnight. A film, ''The Last Wild River'', was shown on Tasmania's two commercial television stations.\n\nIn June 1980, an estimated 10,000 people marched through the streets of Hobart, demanding that the government not proceed with construction. This was the largest rally in the history of the state.<ref>{{Citation| last = Stephen  | first = Sarah  | title = 10th anniversary of the Franklin blockade  | magazine = Green Left Weekly  | issue= 80 | location = Sydney  | date = 18 November 1992  | url= http://www.greenleft.org.au/node/2601 | accessdate = 2011-08-09}}</ref>\n\n== Attempts at compromise ==\nThe [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] state government, under premier [[Doug Lowe (Australian politician)|Doug Lowe]], backed down from the original proposal, and agreed to place the Franklin River in a new [[Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park|Wild Rivers National Park]]. Instead of the original 'Gordon below Franklin' proposal, Lowe now backed an alternative, the 'Gordon above Olga' scheme.<ref>For maps of the proposed schemes see - Thompson, Peter (1981) ''Power In Tasmania'' ACF {{ISBN|0858020645}}  pp.36 noting the potential confusion for which schemes was what -''Integrated'' meant damming the King and Franklin as one, and the Lower Franklin and Oga rivers as the other.  ''Separate'' meant Gordon above the Olga, and The King  and Fraklin dammed the same as in the  Integrated scheme</ref> While this was above the Gordon's junction with the Franklin, it still would have intruded into wilderness quality areas. This compromise did not appease the environmental groups, who maintained a policy of no dams in southwest Tasmania.\n\nIn July, both the pro-dam and anti-dam groups (the former of which also included the union movement) initiated an advertising blitz in Tasmania. The HEC claimed that up to 10,000 potential jobs would be lost if the dam was not built. The conservative dominated Legislative Council then blocked the [[Australian Labor Party (Tasmanian Branch)|Labor]] government's 'Gordon-above-Olga' compromise, instead insisting that they proceed with the original proposal. The two parties could not agree on a solution, which led to a deadlock between the two houses of parliament.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.wilderness.org.au/history-franklin-river-campaign-1976-83|title=History of the Franklin River Campaign 1976-83 {{!}} The Wilderness Society|date=2001-06-15|newspaper=The Wilderness Society|access-date=2017-02-13|language=en}}</ref>\n\n==Inquiry, referendum, and Tasmanian state election==\nIn 1981, [[Australian Democrats]] Senator [[Don Chipp]] initiated a Senate inquiry into \"the natural values of south-west Tasmania to Australia and the world\" and \"the federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance\".\n\nFrom early 1981, archaeologists uncovered evidence of human habitation dating from about 15,000 years BP in caves which would be flooded if the dam were to be built. The most significant cave had been rediscovered by [[geomorphology]] student Kevin Kieran in January 1977,<ref name =Griffiths/> and he first named it [[Fraser Cave]] by after the then Prime Minister, [[Malcolm Fraser]], because ''...we were trying to direct the attention of politicians to the area...'''.<ref>[http://www.janesoceania.com/australia_aboriginal_iceage_walktotasmania/index1.htm AUSTRALIA, An Ice Age - Walk to Tasmania]</ref> It was renamed Kutikina in mid-1982, as suggested by the [[Tasmanian Aboriginal Centre]].

In rounded figures, 47% voted in favour of the original Gordon below Franklin scheme, 8% for the compromise Gordon above Olga scheme, and 45% voted informally.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" /> There had been a significant campaign for voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot papers, and in total more than 33% of voters did this; these were initially all counted in the informal vote, but some were later recounted as formal as they also included a valid vote for one of the two dam options.<ref name=\"tas-ref\" />\n\nThe ongoing crisis resulted in the replacement of Lowe as premier by [[Harry Holgate]], a Labor politician who was markedly more supportive of the dam proposals. In response, both Lowe and [[Mary Willey]], another Labor MP, resigned from the party and sat in the parliament as independents. This resulted in the loss of a Labor majority in the lower house. [[Norm Sanders]], an [[Australian Democrats]] MP and anti-dam campaigner, moved a no-confidence motion, and a state election was called for 15 May.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nIn May 1982 the Holgate Labor government was defeated by the strongly pro-dam Liberal Party under [[Robin Gray (Australian politician)|Robin Gray]]. The new Premier immediately ordered the original plan to go ahead and passed the necessary legislation. Gray attempted to dissuade the federal government from intervening by threatening to secede from the Commonwealth if they did so. The federal government initially declined to intervene in the dispute.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n== The campaigns broadens ==\nDuring 1982, active membership of anti-dam organisations increased a hundredfold in mainland states. The iconic \"No Dams\" triangle sticker was printed.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.australiaforvisitors.com/franklin-gordon-wild-rivers-national-park.html | title=Franklin-Gordon Wild Rivers National Park | publisher=Australia for Visitors | date=2005\u20132011 | accessdate=29 October 2012}}</ref> Rallies and events were held in cities around Australia.  Bob Brown toured the country raising support for the anti-dam campaign, attempting to convince Liberal Prime Minister [[Malcolm Fraser]] to intervene and override the state legislation allowing the dam's construction. British botanist and TV presenter Professor [[David Bellamy]] addressed 5,000{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} people at a Melbourne rally.\n\nBy the end of 1982, any perception that \"greenies\" equated with hippies had been greatly challenged, for example in Sydney, [[Bob Brown]] and Bellamy addressed 500 people at a candle-lit dinner serenaded by string quartet,<ref>The [[The Sydney Morning Herald|SMH]]'s ''Stay In Touch'' column plugged this dinner a couple of days before.</ref><ref>Tim Lamble[?spelling] operated his programmed slide show with dual projectors fading in and out 35mm slides of Tasmanian wilderness photographs, set to recorded music.</ref> ABC's classical music radio station featured a \"Concert for the Franklin\", and electronics entrepreneur [[Dick Smith (entrepreneur)|Dick Smith]] committed to civil disobedience. Many people who had not previously considered conservation issues decided that wilderness was a vote-worthy issue, as evidenced by the following ballot paper write-in campaigns.\n\nIn the federal [[1982 Lowe by-election|Lowe by-election]] in Sydney, March 1982, volunteers<ref>Volunteers were co-opted from the Australian Conservation Foundation by the NSW South West Tasmania Committee.</ref> at every polling booth encouraged voters to write \"No Dams\" on their ballot paper, and 9% did so.<ref>Scrutineers issued this figure in a press release, suggesting a headline like \"Franklin River comes 3rd in by-election\".

On the same day, the UNESCO committee in Paris was due to list the Tasmanian wild rivers as a World Heritage site. The blockade, at \"Warners Landing\" ({{coord|42|34|7|S|145|41|24|E|type:mountain_region:AU-TAS}}) drew an estimated 2,500 people, from not only Tasmania, but also from interstate and overseas. This resulted in the subsequent proclamation of the Tasmanian Wilderness World Heritage Area, which covered both the Franklin and Gordon Rivers. However, Tasmania itself was still divided, with a pro-dam rally in [[Hobart]] also attracting around 2,500 people. While the blockade was ongoing, Norm Sanders resigned from the [[Tasmanian House of Assembly]] to contest a seat in the [[Australian Senate]]. He was replaced in the Assembly by [[Bob Brown]], who had only been released from jail the previous day after spending nineteen days behind bars for his role in the blockade.\n\nThroughout January 1983 around fifty people arrived at the blockade each day. The state government made things difficult for the protesters, passing several laws and enforcing special bail conditions for those arrested. Bulldozers were unloaded at the site from a barge under the protection of police. A total of 1,217 arrests were made, many simply for being present at the blockade. Protesters impeded machinery and occupied sites associated with the construction work. Nearly 500 people were imprisoned for breaking the terms of their bail. This caused an overflow of prisons in the region. British botanist [[David Bellamy]] was jailed, which gave the dispute international attention. The author [[John Marsden (writer)|John Marsden]], after being arrested at the blockade, was placed in the high-security [[HM Prison Risdon|Risdon Prison]] for a night, as there was nowhere else to hold him.\n\nIn February, a Hobart rally against the dam drew approximately 20,000 people. On 1 March, the movement launched a day of action, which they labelled 'G-Day'. 231 people were arrested as a flotilla of boats took to the Gordon River. In Hobart, the Wilderness Society flag was flown above the HEC building.\n\nOn 2 March the Wilderness Society backed the publication of what were then rare full-page colour advertisements in ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and Melbourne's ''[[The Age]]'' newspapers of what would soon become an iconic photograph:<ref>[http://www.nla.gov.au/pub/gateways/archive/63/p08a02.html Pictures Collection: Peter Dombrovskis Wilderness Images], National Library of Australia. \"The photograph made the Franklin River a household word, and became an icon of the environmentalist cause.\"</ref> ''Morning Mist, Rock Island Bend, Franklin River'' by [[Peter Dombrovskis]].

The new [[Prime Minister of Australia|prime minister]], [[Bob Hawke]], had vowed to stop the dam from being built,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://envlaw.com.au/tasmanian-dam-case/|title=Environmental Law Australia {{!}}   Tasmanian Dam Case|website=envlaw.com.au|language=en-AU|access-date=2017-02-13}}</ref> and the anti-dam vote increased Hawke's majority - some federal Victorian seats were notable for having a strong interest in the issue.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} However, in Tasmania, the vote went against the national trend and the Liberals held all five seats. Hawke's government first passed regulations under the existing ''National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act'' 1975, and then passed the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983, which prohibited Franklin River dam-related clearing, excavation and building activities that had been authorised by Tasmanian state legislation.\n\nHowever, the Tasmanian government ignored both the federal regulations and legislation and continued to order work on the dam. The issue was brought before the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] with the first day of hearings on 31 May 1983. The government of Tasmania claimed that the federal government had no powers under the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]] to pass either the regulations or the legislation. They claimed that as the right to legislate for the environment was not named in the Constitution, and was thus a residual power held by the states, that the ''World Heritage Properties Conservation Act'' 1983 was unconstitutional. The federal government, however, claimed (successfully) that they had the right to do so, under the 'external affairs' provision of the Constitution as, by passing legislation blocking the dam's construction, they were fulfilling their responsibilities under an international treaty (the [[UNESCO]] ''Convention for the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage'', Australia having signed and ratified that convention and the Franklin River having been listed on it). The Commonwealth government also argued (successfully) that the federal legislation was supported by the constitutional powers of a federal government to pass laws about corporations and about the people of any race (in this case the aboriginal race, whose sacred caves along the Franklin would have been inundated).{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\nThe resulting court case became known as [[Commonwealth v Tasmania]]. On 1 July 1983, in a landmark decision, the High Court on circuit in Brisbane ruled by a vote of 4 to 3 in the federal government's favour. Judges Mason, Murphy, Brennan and Deane were in the majority and justices Wilson and Dawson with Chief Justice Gibbs were in the minority. This ruling gave the federal government the power to legislate on any issue if necessary to enforce an international treaty and has been the subject of controversy ever since. Justice [[Lionel Murphy]] wrote most broadly of the Franklin Dam decision's broader environmental and social implications in terms of the [[UNESCO]] Convention's [[common heritage of humanity]] principle, stating that \"The preservation of the world's heritage must not be looked at in isolation but as part of the co-operation between nations which is calculated to achieve intellectual and moral solidarity of mankind and so reinforce the bonds between people which promote peace and displace those of narrow nationalism and alienation which promote war...[t]he encouragement of people to think internationally, to regard the culture of their own country as part of world culture, to conceive a physical, spiritual and intellectual world heritage, is important in the endeavour to avoid the destruction of humanity.\"<ref>Commonwealth v Tasmania (1983) 46 ALR 625 at 733 and 734.</ref> The High Court ruling ended the dam's construction, and the plans have never been revived.\n\nThe demise of plans for the Franklin Dam also largely ended the building of dams for the generation of hydroelectricity in Australia.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ecogeneration.com.au/news/hydroelectricity_in_australia_past_present_and_future/055974/ |author=Harries, David |title=Hydroelectricity in Australia: past, present and future |date=March 2011 |journal=ecogeneration |publisher=Great Southern Press |accessdate=6 July 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706183448/http://ecogeneration.com.au/news/hydroelectricity_in_australia_past_present_and_future/055974/ |archivedate=6 July 2015 }}</ref>\n\nHowever, dam-building by the Hydro was not finished. The corporation was still able to construct a 'compromise' power development scheme on the nearby [[King River, Tasmania|King River]] and [[Henty River]] to compensate for the loss of the potential power generation from the Franklin scheme. Further on in time, the [[West Coast Wilderness Railway]] - the reconstruction of the old Mount Lyell Abt Railway between [[Queenstown, Tasmania|Queenstown]] and Regatta point, was mainly financed by compensation funds allocated to the Tasmanian Government for the \"loss\" of the Franklin River or Gordon River dams.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n==Postscript==\n\nIn April 1983 the Australian Government sent a [[Dassault Mirage III|Mirage jet]] and later an [[General Dynamics F-111C|RF-111]],<ref>[http://airpower.airforce.gov.au/HistoryRecord/HistoryRecordDetail.aspx?rid=158 Second \u2018spy\u2019 mission to Tasmania], 08 Apr 1983, Air Power Development Centre,Department of Defence</ref> from the Royal Australian Air Force, to undertake a reconnaissance mission over the dam to gather evidence that the Tasmanian Government was not complying with Federal legislation to stop work.<ref>{{cite interview |subject=Lowe, Doug |subject-link=Doug Lowe (Australian politician) |subject2=Brown, Bob |subject-link2=Bob Brown |subject3=Gray, Robin |subject-link3=Robin Gray (Australian politician) |subject4=Holgate, Harry |subject-link4=Harry Holgate |subject5=others |interviewer=Maura Angle |title=We look back at one of Tasmania's most defining periods in history, the Franklin dam dispute |url=http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/tas/content/2003/s890008.htm |type=Interview: Transcript |work=[[Stateline (TV program)|Stateline]] |publisher=[[ABC (Australian TV channel)|ABC TV]] |location=[[Tasmania]] |date=27 June 2003 |year= |page= |pages= |access-date=11 July 2015  |quote=}}</ref><ref>[http://www.aph.gov.au/SENATE/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf Papers on Parliament 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001024544/http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/pubs/pops/pop04/pop4.pdf |date=1 October 2009 }} ''\"In preparing the Commonwealth's case for the inevitable High Court challenge by Tasmania, Evans earned the popular title of 'Biggles' for arranging to have Royal Australian Air Force planes fly 'spy flights' over the dam site to collect court evidence.\"'' (p27)</ref> One of the reconnaissance photographs showing the continuing work on the site is displayed at College of Law staff library in the [[Australian National University]].\n\nOn 1 July 2008, former Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] spoke at Hobart's [[Hotel Grand Chancellor, Hobart|Grand Chancellor Hotel]] at a dinner to mark the 25th anniversary of the High Court decision on the [[Tasmanian Dam Case]]. He said the campaign to protect the [[Franklin River]] had important lessons for the struggle against [[global warming]]:\n\n\"...I just want to really round off by saying how relevant, today, is the experience of that time 25 years ago - because we are now faced with unprecedented environmental challenge. The Gordon Below Franklin was, of course, a major issue. But, relatively speaking, it pales into insignificance, against the massive challenge that we as a world are facing now. The very question of survivability is at stake.\n\nAnd as you look at the arguments and the positions of political parties today you see a complete replication of what we experienced back there in 1983. The [[conservatives]]: they never change, they never learn. What was their argument back then? You can't do this, it will cost jobs. It will cost [[economic growth]]. You can't do it, you mustn't do it.\n\nWhat's the argument today? No, we now see, at a time where we have a Labor Government in power, which is committed to take all the decisions that need to be taken to meet this historically unparalleled challenge of [[climate change]] and [[global warming]]. As we have a government committed to action in that regard, we have the conservatives now playing politics on this issue. \n\nI want to say, I want to plead with the conservatives... Now, the conservatives, what do they go on about? They are always talking about family values... What is the greatest obligation that politicians of every party have towards their families now? To their kids, their grandkids and their kids? It is that we take action to pass on to them a planet which is inhabitable, viable and enjoyable. And we must challenge them, and say 'Are you serious about family values? Are you serious about putting family first? If you are, you have no alternative but to join with government and to join with organisations who are committed to bringing about that result'.\n\nI want to conclude by saying this to you all. We can best celebrate this great occasion, the great achievement of [[Bob Brown]] and those who he led, the great achievement of saving the Franklin. We can best celebrate that occasion, best honour those who worked to achieve that result, if we commit ourselves unequivocally... to persuading our society, to persuade our communities, but most of all to persuade our politicians in all political parties to commit themselves to taking action, here within [[Australia]], and combining to ensure that international action is taken to bring about that situation, which I say that we can pass on to our children, our grandchildren and their children, a planet which is safe, inhabitable and enjoyable.\" <ref>Former PM Bob Hawke.
