The [[Southeast Maluku Regency]] (Maluku Tenggara) is sub-divided into six [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan''). Though geographically in the Kai Islands, the city of [[Tual, Indonesia|Tual]] forms a regency-level administration and is not in the Southeast Maluku Regency. It includes a number of islands in the geographical Kai Islands, and it is itself sub-divided into four [[Districts of Indonesia|districts]] (''kecamatan'').\n\nThese two entities, with their administrative capitals, are listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 Census and at the latest (2014) estimates:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

The expected happened, and Parpara then demanded of his brother that he return to him the spilled liquor. Hian endeavoured, of course fruitlessly, to gather it up, and in his efforts dug so deeply into the ground that he made an opening clear through the sky-world.</blockquote><blockquote>Wondering what might lie below, the brothers determined to tie one of their dogs to a long rope and lower him through the aperture; and when they had done this, and the dog had been drawn up again, they found white sand sticking to his feet, whereupon they resolved to go down themselves, although the other inhabitants of the heaven-world refused to accompany them thither.

In 2005 he attempted breaking the long-time British record held by [[Kevin Jefferson]], whose 2003 UK record was 1582 back of hand push ups in one hour. Pruden completed more than 1800 on his first attempt, but the claim had errors in it and was rejected. On July 8, 2005 he reapplied to [[Guinness World Records]] for the 1 hour record.

The story follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], [[Amy Rose]], newcomers [[Big the Cat]] and [[E-102 Gamma]], in their quests to collect the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]] and stop series antagonist [[Doctor Robotnik]] from unleashing [[Chaos (Sonic the Hedgehog character)|Chaos]], an ancient evil. Controlling one of the six characters\u2014each with their own special abilities\u2014players explore a series of themed [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] to progress through the story. ''Sonic Adventure'' retains many elements from prior ''Sonic'' games, such as [[power-up]]s and the [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|ring]]-based [[Health (gaming)|health]] system. Outside the main game, players can play [[minigame]]s like [[racing video game|racing]] and interact with [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]], a [[virtual pet]].\n\nFollowing the cancellation of the [[Sega Saturn]] game ''[[Sonic X-treme]]'', [[Sonic Team]] began work on ''Sonic Adventure'' in 1997. A 60-member development team created the game in ten months, drawing inspiration from locations in [[Peru]] and [[Guatemala]]. [[Yuji Uekawa]] redesigned the characters for their transition to 3D, and features were added to take advantage of the Dreamcast hardware. Sega announced the game in August 1998; it was released in Japan that December and worldwide in September 1999. ''Sonic Adventure'' was [[porting|ported]] to the [[GameCube]] and [[Windows]] in 2003 as ''Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut'', featuring updated graphics and more challenges. A [[High-definition video|high-definition]] version was released digitally for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2010, and for Windows in 2011.\n\n''Sonic Adventure'' received critical acclaim and, with 2.5 million copies sold by August 2006, became the Dreamcast's bestseller. Reviewers lauded the visuals and gameplay, calling it a major technological advancement; some speculated that it could re-establish Sega as the dominant console manufacturer after the relatively unsuccessful Saturn. Others were frustrated by the camera controls and glitches, and reactions to its audio were mixed. Reviews for later releases were less positive; critics felt the game had not aged well and ran at an inconsistent [[frame rate]]. Despite this, journalists have ranked ''Sonic Adventure'' among the best ''Sonic'' games, and it is recognized as an important release in both the series and the platform genre. A sequel, ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', was released in 2001.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic_Adventure_Dreamcast.png|thumb|left|alt=Gameplay screenshot of Speed Highway, one of the levels in Sonic Adventure. In this image, Sonic runs on a road, to a line of rings. The HUD shows a timer, the amount of rings, and the player's lives.|Gameplay screenshot showing [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] in one of the game's levels, Speed Highway.]]\n\n''Sonic Adventure'' is a 3D [[platform game]] with [[action game|action]] and [[Role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements.<ref name=\"firstlook\" /> Players control one of six [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] protagonists as they venture to defeat [[Doctor Robotnik]] and his robot army, who seek the seven magical [[Chaos Emeralds]] and the evil entity [[Chaos (Sonic the Hedgehog character)|Chaos]]. Six [[player character]]s are unlocked as the game progresses, each with their own story and attributes. [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] performs a spin dash, homing attack, and light-speed dash; [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]] flies, swims, and attacks robots using his tails; [[Knuckles the Echidna]] glides, climbs walls, and punches; [[Amy Rose]] can defeat enemies using her hammer; [[Big the Cat]] is slow and carries a [[fishing rod]] he can cast; and [[E-102 Gamma]] can shoot laser beams.<ref name=\"gspotdx\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the start of the game, the player is placed in one of several Adventure Fields, open-ended [[Overworld#Platform games|hub worlds]] inhabited by advice-giving [[non-player character]]s. The player character is guided and instructed by the voice of [[Tikal the Echidna]]. Through exploration, the player discovers entrances to [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] called Action Stages, some of which must be opened using keys hidden in the Adventure Field.<ref name=\":1\"/>{{rp|141\u2013142}} Once the player accesses an Action Stage, they are tasked with a specific objective, which is different for each character.<ref name=\"grevo\" /> Sonic must reach the level's end like in prior ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games; Tails must reach the end before Sonic; Knuckles must find three hidden shards of the Master Emerald; Amy must solve puzzles and avoid being caught by a robot; Big must fish for his pet frog; and Gamma must fight his way through stages using projectiles as a defense.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.gamesdatabase.org/Media/SYSTEM/Sega_Dreamcast//Manual/formated/Sonic_Adventure_-_1999_-_Sega.pdf|title=Sonic Adventure instruction manual|last=|first=|publisher=Sega|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref><ref name=\":1\"/>{{rp|140}}\n\nSome levels include [[minigame]]s separate from the main story. These feature different styles of gameplay, among them [[Shoot 'em up#Rail shooters|rail shooting]], [[racing video game|racing]], and [[sandboarding]]. Some minigames can only be accessed with particular characters. Fulfilling certain objectives allows the player to obtain bonus items. Unlocked minigames and stages the player has completed can be accessed from a Trial Mode on the [[title screen]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nLike previous ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' games, players collect golden [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] as a form of [[health (gaming)|health]]: if the player character is in possession of rings when they are hit by an enemy or other hazard, they will survive, but their rings will scatter and blink before disappearing. Canisters containing [[power-up]]s such as speed shoes, additional rings, [[invincibility]], and elemental shields are also hidden in levels. In several stages, the player engages Robotnik or Chaos in a [[boss fight]] and must deplete the boss's health meter to proceed.<ref name=\"ignrev\" /><ref name=\"gspotrev\" /> Each character starts with a limited number of [[Life (gaming)|lives]], and the player loses a life if the character drowns, gets crushed, or is hit without any rings in their possession. The game ends when the player runs out of lives. Lives can be replenished by collecting 100 rings or a [[1-up]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPlayers may also discover Chao Gardens, hidden, protective environments inhabited by [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]], a [[virtual pet]]. Players can hatch, name, and interact with a Chao,<ref name=\"ignrev\" /> and raise the status of their Chao by giving it small animals found by defeating robots. The Dreamcast's handheld [[Visual Memory Unit]] (VMU) allows the player to download the [[minigame]] ''Chao Adventure'', in which their Chao walks through a course to evolve and improve its skills.<ref name=\"grevo\"/><ref name=\"allgamerev\"/> Evolving one's Chao improves its performance in competitions called Chao Races. Eggs that can produce special types of Chao are hidden throughout the Adventure Fields. Players can earn emblems by playing through Action Stages, searching through the Adventure Fields, or winning Chao Races.<ref name=\"gspotdx\" /><ref name=\"igndx\" /> Each Action Stage has three emblems that can be earned by replaying the stages and fulfilling objectives, such as beating the level within a time limit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot==\nDoctor Robotnik seeks a new way to defeat his longtime nemesis Sonic and conquer the world. During his research, he learns about an entity called Chaos\u2014a creature that, thousands of years ago, helped to protect the Chao and the all-powerful [[Master Emerald]], which balances the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds. When a tribe of [[echidna]]s sought to steal the power of the Emeralds, breaking the harmony they had with the Chao, Chaos retaliated by using the Emeralds' power to transform into a monstrous beast, Perfect Chaos, and wipe them out. Before it could destroy the world, Tikal, a young echidna who befriended Chaos, imprisoned it in the Master Emerald along with herself.\n\nSeeking to use Chaos, Robotnik releases it from the Master Emerald, and tests the creature's natural form on the city of Station Square. When Sonic sees local police fail to defeat it, he and Tails work to stop Robotnik from empowering it with the Chaos Emeralds. At the same time, Knuckles, the only remaining echidna, sets out to find the shards of the Master Emerald and repair it. Activating a new series of robots, including one named Gamma, Robotnik orders them to find Froggy, an amphibian who had eaten a Chaos Emerald after mutating from contact with a piece of Chaos the night he was released. His owner Big seeks to find him as well. In Station Square, Sonic's friend Amy finds a [[Flicky]] being pursued for a Chaos Emerald in its possession, and decides to protect it. When both are captured, Amy convinces Gamma not to work for Robotnik, who helps her to escape, before seeking out and destroying the other robots in his series, sacrificing himself in the process.\n\nDespite Sonic managing to disrupt Robotnik's plans, Chaos manages to absorb all the Chaos Emeralds. Transforming into Perfect Chaos, it rebels against Robotnik and attacks Station Square, devastating the city. Having experienced flashbacks from Tikal, who was released herself, Sonic realizes that Chaos has been in constant torment and sorrow, and that imprisoning it again will not stop it. Using the Emeralds brought to him by the others to transform into his [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Super transformation|super form]], Sonic fights Perfect Chaos and defeats it. Returned to normal, Chaos calms down when he sees the Chao living peacefully in Station Square. Realizing its pain is gone, Tikal decides to take it somewhere safe to live in peace. With Sonic having won, he decides to leave to pursue a fleeing Robotnik.\n\n==Development==\n===Background and concept===\n{{see also|Sonic X-treme#Development|l1=Development of Sonic X-treme}}\n\nDuring the early 1990s, [[Sega]] was one of the most successful video game companies due to the rise of its [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console. Sales for the console were driven by the popularity of its flagship franchise of 2D platformers, ''Sonic the Hedgehog''.<ref name=\"RG2018\"/> During this time, series co-creator [[Yuji Naka]] worked with [[Sega Technical Institute]] (STI) in the United States to develop ''Sonic'' games. After the completion of ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]'' in 1994, Naka moved to work with [[Sonic Team]] in Japan.<ref name=\"Company Profile\" /> STI began developing ''[[Sonic X-treme]]'' for the [[Sega Saturn]]'','' which would have been the first ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' game to feature full [[3D computer graphics|3D]] gameplay.

The story follows [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]], [[Knuckles the Echidna]], [[Amy Rose]], [[Big the Cat]], and [[E-102 Gamma]] in their quests to collect the seven [[Chaos Emeralds]] and stop series antagonist [[Doctor Robotnik]] from unleashing [[Chaos (Sonic the Hedgehog character)|Chaos]], an ancient evil. Controlling one of the six characters\u2014each with their own special abilities\u2014players explore a series of themed [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] to progress through the story. ''Sonic Adventure'' retains many elements from prior ''Sonic'' games, such as [[power-up]]s and the [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|ring]]-based [[Health (gaming)|health]] system. Outside the main game, players can play [[minigame]]s like [[racing video game|racing]] and interact with [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]], a [[virtual pet]].\n\nFollowing the cancellation of the [[Sega Saturn]] game ''[[Sonic X-treme]]'', [[Sonic Team]] began work on ''Sonic Adventure'' in 1997. A 60-member development team created the game in ten months, drawing inspiration from locations in [[Peru]] and [[Guatemala]]. [[Yuji Uekawa]] redesigned the characters for their transition to 3D, and features were added to take advantage of the Dreamcast hardware. Sega announced the game in August 1998; it was released in Japan that December and worldwide in September 1999. ''Sonic Adventure'' was [[porting|ported]] to the [[GameCube]] and [[Windows]] in 2003 as ''Sonic Adventure DX: Director's Cut'', featuring updated graphics and more challenges. A [[High-definition video|high-definition]] version was released digitally for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] in 2010, and for Windows in 2011.\n\n''Sonic Adventure'' received critical acclaim and, with 2.5 million copies sold by August 2006, became the Dreamcast's bestseller. Reviewers lauded the visuals and gameplay, calling it a major technological advancement; some speculated that it could re-establish Sega as the dominant console manufacturer after the relatively unsuccessful Saturn. Others were frustrated by the camera controls and glitches, and reactions to its audio were mixed. Reviews for later releases were less positive; critics felt the game had not aged well and ran at an inconsistent [[frame rate]]. Despite this, journalists have ranked ''Sonic Adventure'' among the best ''Sonic'' games, and it is recognized as an important release in both the series and the platform genre. A sequel, ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'', was released in 2001.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Sonic_Adventure_Dreamcast.png|thumb|left|alt=Gameplay screenshot of Speed Highway, one of the levels in Sonic Adventure.

Six [[player character]]s are unlocked as the game progresses, each with their own story and attributes. [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] performs a spin dash, homing attack, and light-speed dash; [[Miles \"Tails\" Prower]] flies, swims, and attacks robots using his tails; [[Knuckles the Echidna]] glides, climbs walls, and punches; [[Amy Rose]] can defeat enemies using her hammer; [[Big the Cat]] is slow and carries a [[fishing rod]] he can cast; and [[E-102 Gamma]] can shoot laser beams.<ref name=\"gspotdx\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt the start of the game, the player is placed in one of several Adventure Fields, open-ended [[Overworld#Platform games|hub worlds]] inhabited by advice-giving [[non-player character]]s. The player character is guided and instructed by the voice of [[Tikal the Echidna]]. Through exploration, the player discovers entrances to [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] called Action Stages, some of which must be opened using keys hidden in the Adventure Field.<ref name=\":1\"/>{{rp|141\u2013142}} Once the player accesses an Action Stage, they are tasked with a specific objective, which is different for each character.<ref name=\"grevo\" /> Sonic must reach the level's end like in prior ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' games; Tails must reach the end before Sonic; Knuckles must find three hidden shards of the Master Emerald; Amy must solve puzzles and avoid being caught by a robot; Big must fish for his pet frog; and Gamma must fight his way through stages using projectiles as a defense.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|url=https://www.gamesdatabase.org/Media/SYSTEM/Sega_Dreamcast//Manual/formated/Sonic_Adventure_-_1999_-_Sega.pdf|title=Sonic Adventure instruction manual|last=|first=|publisher=Sega|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=|format=[[PDF]]}}</ref><ref name=\":1\"/>{{rp|140}}\n\nSome levels include [[minigame]]s separate from the main story. These feature different styles of gameplay, among them [[Shoot 'em up#Rail shooters|rail shooting]], [[racing video game|racing]], and [[sandboarding]]. Some minigames can only be accessed with particular characters. Fulfilling certain objectives allows the player to obtain bonus items. Unlocked minigames and stages the player has completed can be accessed from a Trial Mode on the [[title screen]].<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nLike previous ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' games, players collect golden [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] as a form of [[health (gaming)|health]]: if the player character is in possession of rings when they are hit by an enemy or other hazard, they will survive, but their rings will scatter and blink before disappearing. Canisters containing [[power-up]]s such as speed shoes, additional rings, [[invincibility]], and elemental shields are also hidden in levels. In several stages, the player engages Robotnik or Chaos in a [[boss fight]] and must deplete the boss's health meter to proceed.<ref name=\"ignrev\" /><ref name=\"gspotrev\" /> Each character starts with a limited number of [[Life (gaming)|lives]], and the player loses a life if the character drowns, gets crushed, or is hit without any rings in their possession.

Lives can be replenished by collecting 100 rings or a [[1-up]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nPlayers may also discover Chao Gardens, hidden, protective environments inhabited by [[Chao (Sonic)|Chao]], a [[virtual pet]]. Players can hatch, name, and interact with a Chao,<ref name=\"ignrev\" /> and raise the status of their Chao by giving it small animals found by defeating robots. The Dreamcast's handheld [[Visual Memory Unit]] (VMU) allows the player to download the [[minigame]] ''Chao Adventure'', in which their Chao walks through a course to evolve and improve its skills.<ref name=\"grevo\"/><ref name=\"allgamerev\"/> Evolving one's Chao improves its performance in competitions called Chao Races. Eggs that can produce special types of Chao are hidden throughout the Adventure Fields. Players can earn emblems by playing through Action Stages, searching through the Adventure Fields, or winning Chao Races.<ref name=\"gspotdx\" /><ref name=\"igndx\" /> Each Action Stage has three emblems that can be earned by replaying the stages and fulfilling objectives, such as beating the level within a time limit.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n==Plot==\nDoctor Robotnik seeks a new way to defeat his longtime nemesis Sonic and conquer the world. During his research, he learns about an entity called Chaos\u2014a creature that, thousands of years ago, helped to protect the Chao and the all-powerful [[Master Emerald]], which balances the power of the seven Chaos Emeralds. When a tribe of [[echidna]]s sought to steal the power of the Emeralds, breaking the harmony they had with the Chao, Chaos retaliated by using the Emeralds' power to transform into a monstrous beast, Perfect Chaos, and wipe them out. Before it could destroy the world, Tikal, a young echidna who befriended Chaos, imprisoned it in the Master Emerald along with herself.\n\nSeeking to use Chaos, Robotnik releases it from the Master Emerald, and tests the creature's natural form on the city of Station Square. When Sonic sees local police fail to defeat it, he and Tails work to stop Robotnik from empowering it with the Chaos Emeralds. At the same time, Knuckles, the only remaining echidna, sets out to find the shards of the Master Emerald and repair it. Activating a new series of robots, including one named Gamma, Robotnik orders them to find Froggy, an amphibian who had eaten a Chaos Emerald after mutating from contact with a piece of Chaos the night he was released. His owner Big seeks to find him as well. In Station Square, Sonic's friend Amy finds a [[Flicky]] being pursued for a Chaos Emerald in its possession, and decides to protect it. When both are captured, Amy convinces Gamma not to work for Robotnik, who helps her to escape, before seeking out and destroying the other robots in his series, sacrificing himself in the process.\n\nDespite Sonic managing to disrupt Robotnik's plans, Chaos manages to absorb all the Chaos Emeralds. Transforming into Perfect Chaos, it rebels against Robotnik and attacks Station Square, devastating the city. Having experienced flashbacks from Tikal, who was released herself, Sonic realizes that Chaos has been in constant torment and sorrow, and that imprisoning it again will not stop it. Using the Emeralds brought to him by the others to transform into his [[Sonic the Hedgehog#Super transformation|super form]], Sonic fights Perfect Chaos and defeats it. Returned to normal, Chaos calms down when he sees the Chao living peacefully in Station Square. Realizing its pain is gone, Tikal decides to take it somewhere safe to live in peace. With Sonic having won, he decides to leave to pursue a fleeing Robotnik.\n\n==Development==\n===Background and concept===\n{{see also|Sonic X-treme#Development|l1=Development of Sonic X-treme}}\n\nDuring the early 1990s, [[Sega]] was one of the most successful video game companies due to the rise of its [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] console.

The golden era of piracy was when H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean fell into anarchy following the defeat of [[M\u1ea1c Thi\u00ean T\u1ee9]]'s administration by [[History of Thailand|Siamese]] army. Meanwhile, foreign ships with which pirate vessels mingled still had freedom of navigation in the area.

On July 28, 1958, their military mission visited the islands and later erected a sovereignty [[stele]] which still stands on the western part of the island Hon Doc.\n\n===Piracy in the past===\nDue to the rugged topography as well as the position on the important trade route, the islands were the ideal base for pirates to hide, ambush and attack crossing merchant ships for a long time. The golden era of piracy was when H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean fell into anarchy following the defeat of [[M\u1ea1c Thi\u00ean T\u1ee9]]'s administration by [[History of Thailand|Siamese]] army. Meanwhile, foreign ships with which pirate vessels mingled still had freedom of navigation in the area. Even when [[French colonial empire|the French]] occupied H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean, this area was still being ravaged by piracy.<ref name=\"dtkhotin\" />\n\nThere are some rumors about [[Buried treasure#Pirate treasure|pirate treasure]] hiding in H\u00e0 Ti\u00ean Islands. In March 1983, an American and a British departing from Ph\u00fa Qu\u1ed1c Island secretly visited the island of Hon Tre Nho ({{lang|vi|h\u00f2n Tre Nh\u1ecf}}) in the archipelago, and they brought radios, cameras, binoculars, nautical charts,... along with themselves. After being captured by local residents, two men claimed that they had a 300-year-old map passed down by their ancestors depicting pirate treasure. In 2009, some fishermen accidentally found a quantity of ancient coins.<ref>{{in lang|vi}} {{cite news|title=Qu\u1ea7n \u0111\u1ea3o H\u1ea3i T\u1eb7c - \u0111\u1ea3o gi\u1ea5u v\u00e0ng? |author=S\u01a1n B\u00ecnh |url=http://www.phapluatvn.vn/so-bao-sap-toi/plcuoituan/201108/Quan-dao-Hai-Tac-dao-giau-vang-2056895/ |publisher=B\u00e1o Ph\u00e1p lu\u1eadt Vi\u1ec7t Nam \u0111i\u1ec7n t\u1eed |date=August 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6D53qmOE7?url=http://www.phapluatvn.vn/so-bao-sap-toi/plcuoituan/201108/Quan-dao-Hai-Tac-dao-giau-vang-2056895/ |archivedate=December 21, 2012 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Demography==\nOnly 6 to 7 islands in the archipelago are inhabited.
