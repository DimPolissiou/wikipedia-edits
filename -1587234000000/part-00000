In 1984, PT and Lula joined the popular ''[[Diretas J\u00e1]]!'' (''Direct [Elections] Now!'') campaign, demanding a direct popular vote for the next Brazilian presidential election. According to the 1967 constitution, Presidents were at that time elected by both Houses of Congress in joint session, with representatives of all State Legislatures; this was widely recognised as a mere sham as, since the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat|March 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat]], each \"elected\" President had been a retired general chosen in a closed military caucus. Lula and the PT supported the public demand for a change in the electoral system. But the campaign was defeated by a vote in Congress that rejected an amendment calling direct elections for the following year, and, in 1985, a civilian president, [[Tancredo Neves]], was elected by the same indirect procedure, with Lula's support. Only four years later, as a direct result of ''Diretas J\u00e1!'' and after years of popular struggle, the 1989 elections were the first in 29&nbsp;years to elect a president by direct popular vote.\n\n=== Elections ===\n[[File:LulaSerra.jpg|thumb|Lula and mayor of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (city)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] [[Jos\u00e9 Serra]], whom he defeated in the [[2002 Brazilian general election|2002 presidential elections]]]]\nLula first ran for office in 1982, for the state government of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], and lost.

Under Lula's leadership, the PT took a stance against the Constitution in the [[1988 Constituent Assembly]], reluctantly agreeing to sign the agreed draft at a later stage.\n\nIn 1989, still as a Congressman, Lula ran as the PT candidate in the first democratic elections for president since 1960. Lula and [[Leonel Brizola]], two popular left-wing candidates, were expected to vie for first place. Lula was viewed as the more left-leaning of the two, advocating immediate land reform and a [[default (finance)|default]] on the [[external debt]]. However, a minor candidate, [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], former governor of [[Alagoas]], quickly amassed support among the nation's \u00e9lite with a more business-friendly agenda. Collor became popular taking emphatic anti-corruption positions; he eventually beat Lula in the second round of the [[1989 Brazilian presidential election|1989 elections]]. In 1992, Collor resigned, under threat of [[impeachment]] for his alleged [[embezzlement]] of public money.\n\nLula refused to run for re-election as a Congressman in 1990, busying himself with expanding the Workers' Party organizations around the country. As the political scene in the 1990s came under the sway of the [[Brazilian real]] monetary stabilization plan, which ended decades of rampant inflation, former Minister of Finance [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] ([[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB)) [[1994 Brazilian general election|defeated Lula in 1994]] and again, by an even wider margin, [[1998 Brazilian general election|in 1998]].\n\nBefore winning the presidency in 2002, Lula had been a strident [[union organizer]] known for his bushy beard and [[Che Guevara]] T-shirts.<ref name=\"WPost\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/03/AR2010100304612_pf.html|title=Brazilian president's handpicked successor leads, faces runoff|first=Juan|last=Forero|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=4 October 2010}}</ref> In the 2002 campaign, Lula foreswore both his informal clothing style and his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit. This last point had worried economists, businessmen and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default along with the existing Argentine default would have a massive ripple effect through the world economy. Embracing [[political consultant]] [[Duda Mendon\u00e7a]]'s advice to pursue a more media-friendly image, Lula led the field in the first round of the [[2002 Brazilian general election|2002 election]], held on 6 October, with a nearly two-to-one margin over PSDB candidate [[Jos\u00e9 Serra]]. He then defeated Serra in the runoff with 61.3 percent of the vote.\n\nAt the [[2006 Brazilian general election|1 October 2006 general elections]], Lula came within a few thousand votes of being reelected in a single round (to date, Cardoso is the only person to win a first-round victory since the return of direct elections in 1989). He faced a [[Two-round system|run-off]] on 29 October and won by a substantial margin over the PSDB's [[Geraldo Alckmin]], albeit with a slightly smaller share of the vote than he'd won in the 2002 runoff (60.83 percent vs 61.3 percent).<ref name=2006-election>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/6095820.stm |title=Brazil re-elects President Lula |work=BBC News |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=30 October 2006 |accessdate=27 April 2007}}</ref> In an interview published 26 August 2007, he said that he had no intention to seek a constitutional change so that he could run for a third consecutive term; he also said that he wanted \"to reach the end of [his] term in a strong position in order to influence the succession.\"<ref>{{cite news |author=Newsroom |title=Brazilian President Vows Not to Seek a Third Term |url=http://www.brazzilmag.com/component/content/article/51/8599-brazilian-president-vows-not-to-seek-a-third-term.html |work=Mercopress via Brazzil Magazine |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=22 June 2013 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071225191620/http://www.brazzilmag.com/content/view/8599/54/ <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 25 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn early September 2018, Brazil's top electoral court banned former president Lula da Silva from running for President on the [[2018 Brazilian general election|2018 general election]] due to his corruption conviction, in accordance with [[Lei da Ficha Limpa]].

From very early on his leading program was to eradicate hunger, following the lead of projects already put into practice by the Fernando Henrique Cardoso administration, but expanded by the new ''[[Fome Zero]]'' (\"Zero Hunger\") program.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.coha.org/2006/06/21/lula-brazils-lost-leader/ |title= Lula \u2013 Brazil's Lost Leader |accessdate=5 April 2008 |last=Kirksey |first=Emily |date=21 June 2006 |work=[[Council on Hemispheric Affairs]] }}</ref> This program brings together a series of programs with the goal to end hunger in Brazil, including the construction of water [[cisterns]] in Brazil's semi-arid region of [[Sert\u00e3o]], plus actions to counter teenage pregnancy, to strengthen [[Family farm|family agriculture]], to distribute a minimum amount of cash to the poor, and many other measures.\n\nThe largest assistance program, however, was ''[[Bolsa Fam\u00edlia]]'' (Family Allowance), which was based upon the previous ''[[Education policy in Brazil#Bolsa Escola|Bolsa Escola]]'' (School Allowance), which was conditional on school attendance, first introduced in the city of [[Campinas]] by then-mayor [[Jos\u00e9 Roberto Magalh\u00e3es Teixeira]]. Not long thereafter, other municipalities and states adopted similar programs. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso later federalized the program in 2001. In 2003, Lula formed ''Bolsa Fam\u00edlia'' by combining ''Bolsa Escola'' with additional allowances for food and kitchen gas. This was preceded by the creation of a new ministry \u2013 the Ministry of Social Development and Eradication of Hunger. This merger reduced administrative costs and bureaucratic complexity for both the families involved and the administration of the program.\n\n''Fome Zero'' has a government budget and accepts donations from the private sector and international organizations. The ''Bolsa Fam\u00edlia'' program has been praised internationally for its achievements, despite internal criticism accusing it of having turned into an electoral weapon.\n\nAlong with projects such as ''Fome Zero'' and ''Bolsa Fam\u00edlia'', another Lula administration flagship program was the [[Growth Acceleration Program]] (PAC). The PAC had a total budget of $646&nbsp;billion reais (US$353&nbsp;billion) by 2010, and was the Lula administration's main investment program. It was intended to strengthen Brazil's infrastructure, and consequently to stimulate the private sector and create more jobs. The social and urban infrastructure sector was scheduled to receive $84.2&nbsp;billion reais (US$46&nbsp;billion).\n\n=== Economy ===\n[[File:Presidente Lula visita a f\u00e1brica da Companhia Brasileira de Alum\u00ednio.jpeg|thumb|Lula on a visit to the [[Brazilian Aluminium Company]]]]\n[[File:WorkSantoAntonio.jpg|thumb|Construction site of the Santo Ant\u00f4nio Dam, with funding from the [[Programa de Acelera\u00e7\u00e3o do Crescimento|Growth Acceleration Program]]]]\nAs Lula gained strength in the run-up to the 2002 elections, the fear of drastic measures, and comparisons with [[Hugo Ch\u00e1vez]] of [[Venezuela]], increased internal market speculation.

In 1984, PT and Lula joined the popular ''[[Diretas J\u00e1]]!'' (''Direct [Elections] Now!'') campaign, demanding a direct popular vote for the next Brazilian presidential election. According to the 1967 constitution, Presidents were at that time elected by both Houses of Congress in joint session, with representatives of all State Legislatures; this was widely recognised as a mere sham as, since the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'\u00e9tat|March 1964 coup d'\u00e9tat]], each \"elected\" President had been a retired general chosen in a closed military caucus. Lula and the PT supported the public demand for a change in the electoral system. But the campaign was defeated by a vote in Congress that rejected an amendment calling direct elections for the following year, and, in 1985, a civilian president, [[Tancredo Neves]], was elected by the same indirect procedure, with Lula's support. Only four years later, as a direct result of ''Diretas J\u00e1!'' and after years of popular struggle, the 1989 elections were the first in 29&nbsp;years to elect a president by direct popular vote.\n\n=== Elections ===\n[[File:LulaSerra.jpg|thumb|Lula and mayor of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (city)|S\u00e3o Paulo]] [[Jos\u00e9 Serra]], whom he defeated in the [[2002 Brazilian general election|2002 presidential elections]]]]\nLula first ran for office in 1982, for the state government of [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]], and lost.

Under Lula's leadership, the PT took a stance against the Constitution in the [[1988 Constituent Assembly]], reluctantly agreeing to sign the agreed draft at a later stage.\n\nIn 1989, still as a Congressman, Lula ran as the PT candidate in the first democratic elections for president since 1960. Lula and [[Leonel Brizola]], two popular left-wing candidates, were expected to vie for first place. Lula was viewed as the more left-leaning of the two, advocating immediate land reform and a [[default (finance)|default]] on the [[external debt]]. However, a minor candidate, [[Fernando Collor de Mello]], former governor of [[Alagoas]], quickly amassed support among the nation's \u00e9lite with a more business-friendly agenda. Collor became popular taking emphatic anti-corruption positions; he eventually beat Lula in the second round of the [[1989 Brazilian presidential election|1989 elections]]. In 1992, Collor resigned, under threat of [[impeachment]] for his alleged [[embezzlement]] of public money.\n\nLula refused to run for re-election as a Congressman in 1990, busying himself with expanding the Workers' Party organizations around the country. As the political scene in the 1990s came under the sway of the [[Brazilian real]] monetary stabilization plan, which ended decades of rampant inflation, former Minister of Finance [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] ([[Brazilian Social Democracy Party]] (PSDB)) [[1994 Brazilian general election|defeated Lula in 1994]] and again, by an even wider margin, [[1998 Brazilian general election|in 1998]].\n\nBefore winning the presidency in 2002, Lula had been a strident [[union organizer]] known for his bushy beard and [[Che Guevara]] T-shirts.<ref name=\"WPost\">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/03/AR2010100304612_pf.html|title=Brazilian president's handpicked successor leads, faces runoff|first=Juan|last=Forero|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=4 October 2010}}</ref> In the 2002 campaign, Lula foreswore both his informal clothing style and his platform plank of linking the payment of Brazil's foreign debt to a prior thorough audit. This last point had worried economists, businessmen and banks, who feared that even a partial Brazilian default along with the existing Argentine default would have a massive ripple effect through the world economy. Embracing [[political consultant]] [[Duda Mendon\u00e7a]]'s advice to pursue a more media-friendly image, Lula led the field in the first round of the [[2002 Brazilian general election|2002 election]], held on 6 October, with a nearly two-to-one margin over PSDB candidate [[Jos\u00e9 Serra]]. He then defeated Serra in the runoff with 61.3 percent of the vote.\n\nAt the [[2006 Brazilian general election|1 October 2006 general elections]], Lula came within a few thousand votes of being reelected in a single round (to date, Cardoso is the only person to win a first-round victory since the return of direct elections in 1989).

Not long thereafter, other municipalities and states adopted similar programs. President Fernando Henrique Cardoso later federalized the program in 2001. In 2003, Lula formed ''Bolsa Fam\u00edlia'' by combining ''Bolsa Escola'' with additional allowances for food and kitchen gas. This was preceded by the creation of a new ministry \u2013 the Ministry of Social Development and Eradication of Hunger. This merger reduced administrative costs and bureaucratic complexity for both the families involved and the administration of the program.\n\n''Fome Zero'' has a government budget and accepts donations from the private sector and international organizations. The ''Bolsa Fam\u00edlia'' program has been praised internationally for its achievements, despite internal criticism accusing it of having turned into an electoral weapon.\n\nAlong with projects such as ''Fome Zero'' and ''Bolsa Fam\u00edlia'', another Lula administration flagship program was the [[Growth Acceleration Program]] (PAC). The PAC had a total budget of $646&nbsp;billion reais (US$353&nbsp;billion) by 2010, and was the Lula administration's main investment program. It was intended to strengthen Brazil's infrastructure, and consequently to stimulate the private sector and create more jobs.

The film stars husband and wife actors [[Patrick J. Adams]] and [[Troian Bellisario]], playing astrophysicist Isaac and itinerant artist Clara, who fall in love while searching for signs of intelligent life in the universe.\n\n==Plot==\nDr. Isaac Bruno holds a postdoctoral research fellowship in astrophysics at (fictional) Ontario University, in [[Toronto]]. His goal of finding signs of intelligent life in the universe has become an obsession, linked to an unspecified trauma in his personal life two years earlier. He has become increasingly antagonistic towards his students and has taken to misappropriating time on ground-based telescopes in Chile, intended for a colleague's research. His department head suspends him, denying him any access to the school's research facilities.\n\nThe [[Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite|TESS]] orbiting telescope is launched, providing enormous amounts of data that is shared with the world, in a community effort to analyze and find possible life on [[exoplanet]]s. Isaac posts flyers looking for an unpaid research assistant, offering nothing but room and board. His only response is from Clara, an uneducated artist who has lived a [[Bohemianism|Bohemian lifestyle]]. Clara has her own secrets, seen taking some type of medicine for an unspecified issue.\n\nIsaac focuses on results from [[Red dwarf|M dwarf]] stars, believing it to be a niche that no one else will bother with. When Clara finds a promising exoplanet, Isaac sneaks into the university in the night and lies to the telescope operators in Chile, claiming to have permission from his friend Charlie, to get more data on the planet.\n\nCharlie is furious, but also intrigued by the data results. He advises Isaac to contact Rebecca, Isaac's ex-wife, who holds an endowed chair at [[California Institute of Technology|Caltech]]. Clara convinces Isaac to contact Rebecca, despite his reluctance. The upheaval in their lives is finally revealed, when Rebecca tells Isaac that finding life will not bring back their dead baby son. She gets him some time on the [[W. M. Keck Observatory|Keck]] telescope. This results in proving that they have found a [[Planetary habitability|habitable planet candidate]].\n\nClara is falling in love with Isaac, but he has become jaded about love or anything else that can not be scientifically proven. She kisses him, then abruptly backs off when he starts to respond. When Charlie's wife has a baby, Isaac pontificates on how a minuscule change took his own son, and could equally change the entire universe. Clara reminds him that those same minuscule changes did result in his son existing at all. This leads to them finally becoming a couple. \n\nWhen they learn that someone else discovered \u201ctheir\u201d planet a week before them, Isaac becomes despondent. He soon decides to focus on finding direct evidence of life, rather than just a potentially habitable planet. In his obsession, he is blind to Clara's declining health, until Charlie chastises him. Isaac tells Clara it is time for him to stop his search, but she makes him ignore the data and focus on his inner connection to the universe. He is surprised when it works, but rejects it and her. She grabs her bag to leave - and collapses.\n\nAt the hospital, it is revealed that Clara has an autoimmune disease that is causing the complete breakdown of every organ and muscle in her body. The doctors are shocked that she can even walk or talk, and confirm she will soon be dead. Isaac stays at her bedside for her last few days. Moments before she dies, she tells him he is going to \u201csee it\u201d.\n\nA fresh batch of TESS data is released, and Isaac does \u201csee it\u201d - proof of a seemingly artificial object in coincident orbit with an exoplanet. He takes his findings to Charlie, who introduces him to Dr. Rickman, head of the TESS project. Two years later, at a press conference at the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], Dr. Rickman, Rebecca and Charlie explain that the data gathered now conclusively proves the existence of the artificial object, orbiting a star 200 light years distant, in turn proving the existence of intelligent alien life. Isaac is not in his assigned seat on the panel, choosing instead to spend time reminiscing about Clara.\n\nA few months later, Rebecca summons Isaac to the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] laboratory. She reveals that the aliens have sent a message&mdash;\u201cIsaac Bruno\u201d. He is present when the next message arrives &ndash; an audio file of a [[Bob Dylan]] song that he and Clara often listened to together. The film ends with Isaac smiling through his tears.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Patrick J.

He attended the [[Latin School of Chicago]], where he graduated in 1990. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Williams College]], majoring in [[Theater]] and minoring in [[Computer Science]]. Afterward, he earned his [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree from [[Columbia University]] in [[Acting]] and performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] (New York City), at the [[American Repertory Theater]] in (Cambridge), at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] in (Los Angeles), at Cincinnati's Playhouse in the Park and at the Williamstown Theater Festival. As a child, Freeman was greatly influenced by [[anime]] shows such as ''[[Speed Racer]]'' and ''[[Battle of the Planets]]''. [[Casey Kasem]] voiced the role of his favorite character, Mark of ''Battle of the Planets'' (he actually wanted to change his name to Mark at one point). Later, he discovered ''[[Voltron]]'', ''[[Star Blazers]]'' and ''[[Robotech]]'', being quoted in the January 1999 issue of ''America Interview'' saying, \"That show really blew me away.\" Freeman has also stated that the reason he got into the industry was because of the anime television show ''[[The Vision of Escaflowne]]''. Freeman initially got involved in the anime voice-over industry when a friend of his landed a role in ''[[Peacock King]]''.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Crispin Freeman at Super-Con 2009 5.JPG|thumb|right|Crispin Freeman at Super-Con 2009]]\n{{More footnotes|section|BLP=yes|date=May 2016}}\nKnowing Freeman was a big anime fan, a friend suggested he call up [[Central Park Media]] (CPM) and apply for a job doing English dubs. When originally approached about dubbing, he initially declined. It was not until he remembered all of the anime shows he watched as a child that he realized that many people are introduced to anime through the English dubbed versions. In 1997, Freeman landed the role of [[List of Slayers characters#Zelgadis Graywords|Zelgadis Graywords]] in ''[[Slayers]]'' along with [[Lisa Ortiz]], [[Eric Stuart]] and [[Veronica Taylor]]. He was the second and final voice actor to get the job, after Zelgadis' original voice actor, Daniel Cronin, lost contact with CPM after a year-long halt in the dubbing. Years later he turned to the American animation voice acting grounds. He has been best known for his work in [[Marvel Comics]] based productions such as ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' and ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''. He then starred as several versions of [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' for [[DC Comics]] and [[Warner Bros.]] Since then, Freeman has had various roles throughout his career. He has appeared in many video game titles as memorable characters, such as [[Albedo]] from [[Namco]]'s [[Xenosaga]] series, the god of the sun ''[[Helios]]'' in ''[[God of War III]]'', Haji, Joel the 6th and Van Argeno in ''[[Blood+]]'', the main protagonist [[Baldur]] in Silicon Knights's ''[[Too Human]]'', [[Breakdown (Transformers)|Breakdown]] in ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]'', the [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]] in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', and [[Iron Man]] in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]''.\n\nFreeman teaches classes, workshops, and performance lectures in the Los Angeles area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://crispinfreeman.com/classes.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103050156/http://www.crispinfreeman.com/classes.html |archive-date=2011-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  In addition to classes, Freeman has a website called Voice Acting Mastery which includes podcasts and other resources regarding voice acting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voiceactingmastery.com|title=Voice Acting Mastery: Become a Master Voice Actor in the World of Voice Over - Become the Character.

In anime, some of his prominent roles include [[List of Slayers characters#Zelgadis Graywords|Zelgadis Graywords]] in ''[[Slayers]]'', [[List of Haruhi Suzumiya characters#Kyon|Kyon]] in ''[[The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya]]'', [[Alucard (Hellsing)|Alucard]] in ''[[Hellsing]]'', [[List of Fate/Zero characters|Kirei Kotomine]] in ''[[Fate/Zero]]'' and ''[[Fate/stay night: Unlimited Blade Works]]'', [[Itachi Uchiha]] in ''[[Naruto]]'', and [[List of Durarara!! characters|Shizuo Heiwajima]] in ''[[Durarara!!]]''.\n\n==Early life and education==\n{{No footnotes|section|BLP=yes|date=May 2016}}\nBorn in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], [[Illinois]], Freeman is the oldest of three children. He attended the [[Latin School of Chicago]], where he graduated in 1990. He earned his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Williams College]], majoring in [[Theater]] and minoring in [[Computer Science]]. Afterward, he earned his [[Master of Fine Arts]] degree from [[Columbia University]] in [[Acting]] and performed on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] (New York City), at the [[American Repertory Theater]] in (Cambridge), at the [[Mark Taper Forum]] in (Los Angeles), at Cincinnati's Playhouse in the Park and at the Williamstown Theater Festival. As a child, Freeman was greatly influenced by [[anime]] shows such as ''[[Speed Racer]]'' and ''[[Battle of the Planets]]''. [[Casey Kasem]] voiced the role of his favorite character, Mark of ''Battle of the Planets'' (he actually wanted to change his name to Mark at one point). Later, he discovered ''[[Voltron]]'', ''[[Star Blazers]]'' and ''[[Robotech]]'', being quoted in the January 1999 issue of ''America Interview'' saying, \"That show really blew me away.\" Freeman has also stated that the reason he got into the industry was because of the anime television show ''[[The Vision of Escaflowne]]''. Freeman initially got involved in the anime voice-over industry when a friend of his landed a role in ''[[Peacock King]]''.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Crispin Freeman at Super-Con 2009 5.JPG|thumb|right|Crispin Freeman at Super-Con 2009]]\n{{More footnotes|section|BLP=yes|date=May 2016}}\nKnowing Freeman was a big anime fan, a friend suggested he call up [[Central Park Media]] (CPM) and apply for a job doing English dubs. When originally approached about dubbing, he initially declined. It was not until he remembered all of the anime shows he watched as a child that he realized that many people are introduced to anime through the English dubbed versions. In 1997, Freeman landed the role of [[List of Slayers characters#Zelgadis Graywords|Zelgadis Graywords]] in ''[[Slayers]]'' along with [[Lisa Ortiz]], [[Eric Stuart]] and [[Veronica Taylor]]. He was the second and final voice actor to get the job, after Zelgadis' original voice actor, Daniel Cronin, lost contact with CPM after a year-long halt in the dubbing. Years later he turned to the American animation voice acting grounds. He has been best known for his work in [[Marvel Comics]] based productions such as ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' and ''[[The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes]]''. He then starred as several versions of [[Roy Harper (comics)|Roy Harper]] in ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' for [[DC Comics]] and [[Warner Bros.]] Since then, Freeman has had various roles throughout his career. He has appeared in many video game titles as memorable characters, such as [[Albedo]] from [[Namco]]'s [[Xenosaga]] series, the god of the sun ''[[Helios]]'' in ''[[God of War III]]'', Haji, Joel the 6th and Van Argeno in ''[[Blood+]]'', the main protagonist [[Baldur]] in Silicon Knights's ''[[Too Human]]'', [[Breakdown (Transformers)|Breakdown]] in ''[[Transformers: War for Cybertron]]'', the [[Winter Soldier (comics)|Winter Soldier]] in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance]]'', and [[Iron Man]] in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]''.\n\nFreeman teaches classes, workshops, and performance lectures in the Los Angeles area.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://crispinfreeman.com/classes.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-11-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111103050156/http://www.crispinfreeman.com/classes.html |archive-date=2011-11-03 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  In addition to classes, Freeman has a website called Voice Acting Mastery which includes podcasts and other resources regarding voice acting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voiceactingmastery.com|title=Voice Acting Mastery: Become a Master Voice Actor in the World of Voice Over - Become the Character.

The base in Oslo will then operate mostly Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with a few 737-700s also being retained.

The agreement consists of eight A350-900s with six options and four A330-300Es. The first new long haul aircraft to enter service will be the A330-300E, which were originally planned to replace the aging A340-300s in 2015 as leasing agreements on these aircraft expire. Instead, SAS renewed the leasing agreements to be able to expand its long-haul fleet and used the new A330-300Es to add more long-haul destinations to its network. The A350-900 is planned to enter service in November 2019. SAS has dubbed this \"a total renewal of long haul fleet\", indicating that all former A340 and A330 will be replaced, although the total renewal could also refer to the new interior in the long haul fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=269175 |title=SAS Group - Press |publisher=Se.yhp.waymaker.net |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe first of 8 Airbus A350-900s for SAS is expected to be delivered to the airline before the end of 2019 and to start to operate long haul routes from 28 January 2020.<ref>{{cite journal |title=SAS Scandinavian Airlines |journal=Airliner World |volume=August 2019 |page=11}}</ref> The A350 will first fly on the [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen]] and [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]] route, with the airline planning [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing]], [[Newark Liberty International Airport|New York]], [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]] and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]] when more A350 are delivered in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-announces-first-a350-flights-and-features/|accessdate=25 October 2019|title=SAS announces first A350 flights and features}}</ref>\n\n===Removal of SAS Q400 fleet===\n{{Main|Dash 8 landing gear incidents}}\n[[File:Sas oy-kfe cr9.jpg|thumb|A [[Bombardier CRJ700#CRJ900|Bombardier CRJ900 NextGen]] at Copenhagen in 2011.]]\nIn September 2007, two separate incidents of similar landing gear failures occurred within four days of each other on SAS  Bombardier Q400 aircraft. A third incident occurred in October 2007. On 28 October 2007, in a move that was described as unique by the Swedish press, the board of directors announced that all 27 [[Bombardier Q400]] aircraft were to be removed from service due to the three landing gear failures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=155746|title=SAS removes Dash 8 Q400 from service permanently|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102112035/http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=155746|archivedate=2 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA press release from SAS said that the company had reached a settlement with Bombardier and Goodrich, whereby the airline would receive [[Swedish krona|SEK]] one billion as compensation, while SAS would purchase 27 new aircraft, with an option of 24 more.

SAS aircraft look predominantly white, however, the fuselage is in a very light beige (Pantone Warm Gray 2/Pantone 9083C) with \"Scandinavian\" above the windows in silver lettering (Pantone 877) and \"Airlines\" below the windows in white. The typeface used is [[Rotis#Rotis Semi Serif|Rotis Semi Serif]]. The vertical stabiliser (and winglets) are painted blue (Pantone 2738C) with the classic white SAS logo on it. It is a variant of the traditional SAS logotype, slimmed slightly and stylised by the design company Stockholm Design Lab, as part of the SAS livery change. The engine casing is painted in scarlet (Pantone Warm Red/Pantone 179C) with the word Scandinavian in white, the [[thrust reversers]] in the colour of the fuselage. All other text is painted in Pantone Warm Gray 9. The design also features stylised versions of the Scandinavian flags. All aircraft are named, traditionally after Vikings.\n\nIn September 2019, SAS unveiled an all-new livery,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Scandinavian Way|url=https://www.flysas.com/en/newfleet/|website=www.flysas.com|publisher=Scandinavian Airlines System |accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> which will initially be showcased on a new A350 and an A320neo, before gradually being rolled out to the whole fleet.\n\nApart from the standard livery, SAS also has an Airbus A319 in [[retrojet|retro livery]] and two Boeing 737s and one Airbus A340 in Star Alliance livery.\n\n==Cabin==\n[[File:SAS Carvelle SE-210 (19).jpg|thumb|A Scandinavian Airlines flight attendant serving passengers in the 1960s.]]\n\n===SAS Business===\nOn long-haul flights business class, called ''SAS Business'', is still offered and features wide sleeper seats. On the [[Airbus A330]]s and upgraded [[Airbus A340]]s seating is 1-2-1 on seats that convert into {{convert|196|\u2013|202|cm}} flat beds, with power sockets and a {{convert|15|in}} entertainment screen.\n\n===SAS Plus===\nPlus is SAS' premium economy class. On wide-body aircraft, seating has a 2-3-2 configuration. The seats offered on SAS Plus are wider than those in the SAS Go section.\n\nOn European flights, SAS Plus tickets are refundable and include a meal, a double checked-in baggage allowance, and access to lounges and fast track security at the airport. The SAS Plus passengers are seated at the front of the aircraft and passengers can choose their seat at booking for free, but the seats there are otherwise the same as the SAS Go seats. The two-class system was introduced in June 2013, when [[business class]] was eliminated from intra-European flights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.traveldailymedia.com/192395/sas-revamps-cabin-classes/|title=SAS revamps cabin classes|last=Elliott|first=Mark|publisher=Travel Daily Media|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===SAS Go===\nSAS Go, or economy offers 3-3 seating on intracontinental flights, and 2-4-2 on the A330s and A340s.\n\nSAS offers free coffee and tea to GO passengers on short-haul services, except very short flights like [[Bergen Airport, Flesland|Bergen]]-[[Stavanger Airport, Sola|Stavanger]] or [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm]]-[[Visby Airport|Visby]]. Meals are served to all passengers on long-haul flights.\n\n===SAS Go Light===\nSAS Go Light is a variant of SAS Go with no checked luggage included. Tickets are sold in the same booking class as SAS Go and are otherwise identical. As of December 14, 2017, SAS Go Light is available on both European and Long-haul flights. It is not available on flights within the Nordic countries. SAS Go Light is aimed at competing with [[low-cost carriers]] for those who travel with hand luggage only. Extra luggage allowance for [[EuroBonus]] Silver, Gold, and Diamond members does not apply on SAS Go Light tickets and is only valid for EuroBonus Pandion members.\n\n==Services==\n===Fingerprint biometric identification===\nIn 2006, SAS Sweden launched a new [[biometric]] system for use throughout Sweden. Each passenger's fingerprints are, for security purposes, matched to their respective checked baggage. The new technology will be phased in at all the airports served by SAS, although the use of the system is voluntary for passengers. The system has been introduced in Norway.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/fingerprint-recognition-to-be-introduced-at-arlanda-and-landvetter/ |title=Fingerprint recognition to be introduced at Arlanda and Landvetter |publisher = SAS |year = 2006}}</ref>\n\n===EuroBonus===\n{{Main|EuroBonus}}\nSAS's frequent-flyer program is called EuroBonus. Members earn points on all SAS and Wider\u00f8e flights as well as on Star Alliance flights. Around 50 percent of SAS\u2019 total revenues are generated by EuroBonus members. By August 2015, the EuroBonus program had in excess of four million members.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-celebrates-four-million-eurobonus-members/ |title = SAS celebrates four million EuroBonus members |date= 21 August 2015 }} {{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Fly Home Club===\n''Fly Home Club'' was SAS's membership club for Scandinavians living in Spain. It has closed ever since economic conditions have worsened in Spain and as Scandinavians living in Spain have decided to return home or change locations.{{CN|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Hovercraft===\nBetween 1984 and 1994, SAS operated a [[hovercraft]] service between [[Malm\u00f6]] in Sweden and [[Copenhagen Airport]] in Denmark. Travellers could check in for their flights in Malm\u00f6 and the hovercraft were operated as connecting flights. The service was operated using a handful of [[British Hovercraft Corporation AP1-88]]s, which took an average journey time of 45 minutes to traverse the 17-mile route across the [[\u00d8resund]]; within its first year of operation, hovercraft reportedly carried roughly 100,000 passengers.<ref name = \"popmech hover\">{{cite web |url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YOQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42 |title = New hovercraft replacing airliners |publisher = Popular Mechanics |date = March 1985 |volume = 162, No. 3 |page = 42 |issn = 0032-4558}}</ref> Due to the level of demand experienced, SAS examined the prospects for introducing larger hovercraft, capable of carrying up to 200 passengers, for the service.<ref name = \"popmech hover\"/> However, in 1994, the hovercraft were replaced by [[catamaran]]s. These vessels were in turn discontinued during 2000 due to the opening of the [[\u00d6resund bridge]], which provided a competing rail link between Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen airport.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.classicfastferries.com/cff/pdf/cff_2004_1.pdf |title = SAS: The Hovering Years |publisher = Classic Fast Ferries |year = 2004}}</ref>\n\n===Wi-Fi===\nDuring May 2018, SAS launched a new high-speed [[WiFi]] system supplied by [[Viasat]]. The service is being rolled out on both the short and medium-haul fleets, it is expected to take two years to complete. The new system is much faster than previously available and will enable passengers to stream movies on board. Before this, SAS only offered WiFi on board on its long haul aircraft and a small number of Boeing 737s. WiFi is free for Eurobonus Gold and Diamond members as well as for those travelling in SAS Plus or Business. Otherwise, WiFi can be purchased with EuroBonus points or for a small fee.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-the-first-nordic-airline-to-launch-high-speed-wifi/ |title=SAS the first Nordic airline to launch high speed WiFi |website=SAS |accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{advert|date=February 2019}}\n* 2010:\n** Flightstats: Worlds Most Punctual Airline<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sasgroup.net/en/grand-slam-for-sas-at-grand-travel-awards/ |title=SAS nominated as both the world's and Europe's most punctual airline |publisher=sasgroup.net |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> \n** Simpliflying: Best Use of Social Media in a Crisis Situation<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/SAS/photos/a.281389815787.318771.140344030787/10150288373085788 SAS - Scandinavian Airlines on Facebook]. {{date|1-10-2010|dmy}}.

The base in Oslo will then operate mostly Boeing 737-800 aircraft, with a few 737-700s also being retained.

The agreement consists of eight A350-900s with six options and four A330-300Es. The first new long haul aircraft to enter service will be the A330-300E, which were originally planned to replace the aging A340-300s in 2015 as leasing agreements on these aircraft expire. Instead, SAS renewed the leasing agreements to be able to expand its long-haul fleet and used the new A330-300Es to add more long-haul destinations to its network. The A350-900 is planned to enter service in November 2019. SAS has dubbed this \"a total renewal of long haul fleet\", indicating that all former A340 and A330 will be replaced, although the total renewal could also refer to the new interior in the long haul fleet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=269175 |title=SAS Group - Press |publisher=Se.yhp.waymaker.net |date=2013-06-25 |accessdate=2014-03-17}}</ref>\n\nThe first of 8 Airbus A350-900s for SAS is expected to be delivered to the airline before the end of 2019 and to start to operate long haul routes from 28 January 2020.<ref>{{cite journal |title=SAS Scandinavian Airlines |journal=Airliner World |volume=August 2019 |page=11}}</ref> The A350 will first fly on the [[Copenhagen Airport|Copenhagen]] and [[O'Hare International Airport|Chicago]] route, with the airline planning [[Beijing Capital International Airport|Beijing]], [[Newark Liberty International Airport|New York]], [[Haneda Airport|Tokyo]], [[Shanghai Pudong International Airport|Shanghai]], [[Hong Kong International Airport|Hong Kong]] and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]] when more A350 are delivered in 2020.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-announces-first-a350-flights-and-features/|accessdate=25 October 2019|title=SAS announces first A350 flights and features}}</ref>\n\n===Removal of SAS Q400 fleet===\n{{Main|Dash 8 landing gear incidents}}\n[[File:Sas oy-kfe cr9.jpg|thumb|A [[Bombardier CRJ700#CRJ900|Bombardier CRJ900 NextGen]] at Copenhagen in 2011.]]\nIn September 2007, two separate incidents of similar landing gear failures occurred within four days of each other on SAS  Bombardier Q400 aircraft. A third incident occurred in October 2007. On 28 October 2007, in a move that was described as unique by the Swedish press, the board of directors announced that all 27 [[Bombardier Q400]] aircraft were to be removed from service due to the three landing gear failures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=155746|title=SAS removes Dash 8 Q400 from service permanently|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141102112035/http://se.yhp.waymaker.net/sasgroup/release.asp?id=155746|archivedate=2 November 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nA press release from SAS said that the company had reached a settlement with Bombardier and Goodrich, whereby the airline would receive [[Swedish krona|SEK]] one billion as compensation, while SAS would purchase 27 new aircraft, with an option of 24 more.

SAS aircraft look predominantly white, however, the fuselage is in a very light beige (Pantone Warm Gray 2/Pantone 9083C) with \"Scandinavian\" above the windows in silver lettering (Pantone 877) and \"Airlines\" below the windows in white. The typeface used is [[Rotis#Rotis Semi Serif|Rotis Semi Serif]]. The vertical stabiliser (and winglets) are painted blue (Pantone 2738C) with the classic white SAS logo on it. It is a variant of the traditional SAS logotype, slimmed slightly and stylised by the design company Stockholm Design Lab, as part of the SAS livery change. The engine casing is painted in scarlet (Pantone Warm Red/Pantone 179C) with the word Scandinavian in white, the [[thrust reversers]] in the colour of the fuselage. All other text is painted in Pantone Warm Gray 9. The design also features stylised versions of the Scandinavian flags. All aircraft are named, traditionally after Vikings.\n\nIn September 2019, SAS unveiled an all-new livery,<ref>{{cite web|title=The Scandinavian Way|url=https://www.flysas.com/en/newfleet/|website=www.flysas.com|publisher=Scandinavian Airlines System |accessdate=20 September 2019}}</ref> which will initially be showcased on a new A350 and an A320neo, before gradually being rolled out to the whole fleet.\n\nApart from the standard livery, SAS also has an Airbus A319 in [[retrojet|retro livery]] and two Boeing 737s and one Airbus A340 in Star Alliance livery.\n\n==Cabin==\n[[File:SAS Carvelle SE-210 (19).jpg|thumb|A Scandinavian Airlines flight attendant serving passengers in the 1960s.]]\n\n===SAS Business===\nOn long-haul flights business class, called ''SAS Business'', is still offered and features wide sleeper seats. On the [[Airbus A330]]s and upgraded [[Airbus A340]]s seating is 1-2-1 on seats that convert into {{convert|196|\u2013|202|cm}} flat beds, with power sockets and a {{convert|15|in}} entertainment screen.\n\n===SAS Plus===\nPlus is SAS' premium economy class. On wide-body aircraft, seating has a 2-3-2 configuration. The seats offered on SAS Plus are wider than those in the SAS Go section.\n\nOn European flights, SAS Plus tickets are refundable and include a meal, a double checked-in baggage allowance, and access to lounges and fast track security at the airport. The SAS Plus passengers are seated at the front of the aircraft and passengers can choose their seat at booking for free, but the seats there are otherwise the same as the SAS Go seats. The two-class system was introduced in June 2013, when [[business class]] was eliminated from intra-European flights.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.traveldailymedia.com/192395/sas-revamps-cabin-classes/|title=SAS revamps cabin classes|last=Elliott|first=Mark|publisher=Travel Daily Media|accessdate=12 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n===SAS Go===\nSAS Go, or economy offers 3-3 seating on intracontinental flights, and 2-4-2 on the A330s and A340s.\n\nSAS offers free coffee and tea to GO passengers on short-haul services, except very short flights like [[Bergen Airport, Flesland|Bergen]]-[[Stavanger Airport, Sola|Stavanger]] or [[Stockholm Arlanda Airport|Stockholm]]-[[Visby Airport|Visby]]. Meals are served to all passengers on long-haul flights.\n\n===SAS Go Light===\nSAS Go Light is a variant of SAS Go with no checked luggage included. Tickets are sold in the same booking class as SAS Go and are otherwise identical. As of December 14, 2017, SAS Go Light is available on both European and Long-haul flights. It is not available on flights within the Nordic countries. SAS Go Light is aimed at competing with [[low-cost carriers]] for those who travel with hand luggage only. Extra luggage allowance for [[EuroBonus]] Silver, Gold, and Diamond members does not apply on SAS Go Light tickets and is only valid for EuroBonus Pandion members.\n\n==Services==\n===Fingerprint biometric identification===\nIn 2006, SAS Sweden launched a new [[biometric]] system for use throughout Sweden. Each passenger's fingerprints are, for security purposes, matched to their respective checked baggage. The new technology will be phased in at all the airports served by SAS, although the use of the system is voluntary for passengers. The system has been introduced in Norway.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/fingerprint-recognition-to-be-introduced-at-arlanda-and-landvetter/ |title=Fingerprint recognition to be introduced at Arlanda and Landvetter |publisher = SAS |year = 2006}}</ref>\n\n===EuroBonus===\n{{Main|EuroBonus}}\nSAS's frequent-flyer program is called EuroBonus. Members earn points on all SAS and Wider\u00f8e flights as well as on Star Alliance flights. Around 50 percent of SAS\u2019 total revenues are generated by EuroBonus members. By August 2015, the EuroBonus program had in excess of four million members.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-celebrates-four-million-eurobonus-members/ |title = SAS celebrates four million EuroBonus members |date= 21 August 2015 }} {{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n===Fly Home Club===\n''Fly Home Club'' was SAS's membership club for Scandinavians living in Spain. It has closed ever since economic conditions have worsened in Spain and as Scandinavians living in Spain have decided to return home or change locations.{{CN|date=April 2020}}\n\n===Hovercraft===\nBetween 1984 and 1994, SAS operated a [[hovercraft]] service between [[Malm\u00f6]] in Sweden and [[Copenhagen Airport]] in Denmark. Travellers could check in for their flights in Malm\u00f6 and the hovercraft were operated as connecting flights. The service was operated using a handful of [[British Hovercraft Corporation AP1-88]]s, which took an average journey time of 45 minutes to traverse the 17-mile route across the [[\u00d8resund]]; within its first year of operation, hovercraft reportedly carried roughly 100,000 passengers.<ref name = \"popmech hover\">{{cite web |url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YOQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA42&lpg=PA42 |title = New hovercraft replacing airliners |publisher = Popular Mechanics |date = March 1985 |volume = 162, No. 3 |page = 42 |issn = 0032-4558}}</ref> Due to the level of demand experienced, SAS examined the prospects for introducing larger hovercraft, capable of carrying up to 200 passengers, for the service.<ref name = \"popmech hover\"/> However, in 1994, the hovercraft were replaced by [[catamaran]]s. These vessels were in turn discontinued during 2000 due to the opening of the [[\u00d6resund bridge]], which provided a competing rail link between Malm\u00f6 and Copenhagen airport.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.classicfastferries.com/cff/pdf/cff_2004_1.pdf |title = SAS: The Hovering Years |publisher = Classic Fast Ferries |year = 2004}}</ref>\n\n===Wi-Fi===\nDuring May 2018, SAS launched a new high-speed [[WiFi]] system supplied by [[Viasat]]. The service is being rolled out on both the short and medium-haul fleets, it is expected to take two years to complete. The new system is much faster than previously available and will enable passengers to stream movies on board. Before this, SAS only offered WiFi on board on its long haul aircraft and a small number of Boeing 737s. WiFi is free for Eurobonus Gold and Diamond members as well as for those travelling in SAS Plus or Business. Otherwise, WiFi can be purchased with EuroBonus points or for a small fee.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sasgroup.net/en/sas-the-first-nordic-airline-to-launch-high-speed-wifi/ |title=SAS the first Nordic airline to launch high speed WiFi |website=SAS |accessdate=3 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Awards==\n{{advert|date=February 2019}}\n* 2010:\n** Flightstats: Worlds Most Punctual Airline<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sasgroup.net/en/grand-slam-for-sas-at-grand-travel-awards/ |title=SAS nominated as both the world's and Europe's most punctual airline |publisher=sasgroup.net |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> \n** Simpliflying: Best Use of Social Media in a Crisis Situation<ref>[https://www.facebook.com/SAS/photos/a.281389815787.318771.140344030787/10150288373085788 SAS - Scandinavian Airlines on Facebook]. {{date|1-10-2010|dmy}}.
