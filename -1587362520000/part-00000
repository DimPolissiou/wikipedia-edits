It was established in 1960 to replace the colonial-era Singapore Improvement Trust.\n\nHDB is credited with clearing the [[squatter]]s and [[slum]]s, and resettling residents into low-cost state-built housing in the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.hdb.gov.sg/cs/infoweb/about-us/news-and-publications/publications/hdb-publications HDB Quality Living] - Sample Housing Survey</ref> By 2019, 78.7% of Singaporeans live in public residential developments, ranging from studio units to executive condominiums provided by the HDB, a major factor in Singapore having one of the highest home-ownership rates - over 90% of the resident population - in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=Singapore Resident Households by dwellings|url=https://www.singstat.gov.sg/modules/infographics/-/media/Files/visualising_data/infographics/Population/singapore-population13022019|accessdate=15 February 2015}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nIn the aftermath of [[World War II]], the city sustained massive damage; the low construction rate and rebuilding efforts also exacerbated [[Singapore]]'s housing shortages in the decades that followed. In 1947, the ''British Housing Committee Report'' noted Singapore had \"one of the world\u2019s worst [[slum]]s -- 'a disgrace to a civilised community'\", with an average person-per-building density was 18.2.\n\nIn its election campaign in 1959, the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) recognized that housing required urgent attention and pledged to provide low-cost housing for the poor. When it won the elections and formed the newly elected government, it took immediate action to solve the housing shortage. The government passed the ''Housing & Development Act of 1960'', which replaced the colonial-era [[Singapore Improvement Trust]] with the Housing & Development Board on 1 February 1960.\n\nLed by [[Lim Kim San]], the HDB made first priority during formation to build as many low-cost housing units as possible and introduced the Five-Year Plan. The housing that was initially built was mostly meant for rentals by the lower-income group. The Home Ownership for the People Scheme was also introduced to help this group of people to buy instead of renting their flats. While the new scheme acted as a hedge against inflation, it provided financial security to homeowners. Later, the people were allowed to use their [[Central Provident Fund]] money for down payments. These efforts were, however, not successful enough in convincing the people living in the squatter settlements to move into these flats. It was only later, after the [[Bukit Ho Swee Fire]] in 1961, that the HDB's efficiency and earnestness won the people over.\n\nThe HDB estimated that from 1960 to 1969, an average of 147,000 housing units\u201480,000 from the current deficit, 20,000 due to the redevelopment of the Central Area, and 47,000 due to population increase\u2014would need to be constructed, or an average of about 14,000 a year. However, the private sector only had the ability to provide 2,500 per year, and at price levels out of reach of the low-income population.<ref name=gurban2007 /> As many as 51,031 housing units were built between 1960 and 1965 by the HDB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/208d33cc-23c8-4d52-865b-c045d156ff69|title= The Housing and Development Board is established|work= historySG|publisher= National Library Board}}</ref> Due to land constraints, high-rise and high-density [[apartment|flats]] were chosen.\n\nThe HDB's policies were largely in line with the [[manifesto]] set out by the Singaporean government: the government was promoting [[social cohesion]] and [[patriotism]] within the country. In 1968, citizens were allowed to use their pension fund ([[Central Provident Fund]]) to purchase and own the homes they were renting to give them a stake of the country and as an incentive to work hard. In 1989, the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) was introduced to promote [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial integration]]. To prevent [[social class|social stratification]] that may lead to social conflict, the housing of different income groups is mixed together in [[Housing estate|estates]] and [[new towns]].\n\nIn the 1990s, the HDB concentrated on upgrading existing older flats, installing new facilities such as [[elevator|lift]]s that stop on every floor. [[Studio apartment]]s were specially built to suit the needs of senior citizens in Singapore's ageing society.\n\nOn 1 July 2003, the Building & Development Division of HDB was corporatised to form HDB Corporation Pte.

In 1947, the ''British Housing Committee Report'' noted Singapore had \"one of the world\u2019s worst [[slum]]s -- 'a disgrace to a civilised community'\", and the average person-per-building density was 18.2 by 1947. [[High-rise building]]s were also rare. In 1959, the shortage problem remained. An HDB paper estimated that in 1966, 300,000 people lived in squatter settlements in the suburbs and 250,000 lived in squalid shophouses in the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]].<ref name=gurban2007>{{cite journal|last=Yuen|first=Belinda|title=Squatters no more: Singapore social housing|journal=Global Urban Development Magazine|date=November 2007|volume=3|issue=1|url=http://www.globalurban.org/GUDMag07Vol3Iss1/Yuen.htm}}</ref> In its election campaign in 1959, the [[People's Action Party]] (PAP) recognized that housing required urgent attention and pledged to provide low-cost housing for the poor if it was elected. When it won the elections and formed the newly elected government, it took immediate action to solve the housing shortage. The government passed the ''Housing & Development Act of 1960'', which replaced the colonial-era [[Singapore Improvement Trust]] with the Housing & Development Board on 1 February 1960.\n\nLed by [[Lim Kim San]], the HDB made first priority during formation to build as many low-cost housing units as possible and introduced the Five-Year Plan. The housing that was initially built was mostly meant for rentals by the lower-income group. The Home Ownership for the People Scheme was also introduced to help this group of people to buy instead of renting their flats. While the new scheme acted as a hedge against inflation, it provided financial security to homeowners. Later, the people were allowed to use their [[Central Provident Fund]] money for down payments. These efforts were, however, not successful enough in convincing the people living in the squatter settlements to move into these flats. It was only later, after the [[Bukit Ho Swee Fire]] in 1961, that the HDB's efficiency and earnestness won the people over.\n\nThe HDB estimated that from 1960 to 1969, an average of 147,000 housing units\u201480,000 from the current deficit, 20,000 due to the redevelopment of the Central Area, and 47,000 due to population increase\u2014would need to be constructed, or an average of about 14,000 a year. However, the private sector only had the ability to provide 2,500 per year, and at price levels out of reach of the low-income population.<ref name=gurban2007 /> As many as 51,031 housing units were built between 1960 and 1965 by the HDB.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/208d33cc-23c8-4d52-865b-c045d156ff69|title= The Housing and Development Board is established|work= historySG|publisher= National Library Board}}</ref> Due to land constraints, high-rise and high-density [[apartment|flats]] were chosen.\n\nThe HDB's policies were largely in line with the [[manifesto]] set out by the Singaporean government: the government was promoting [[social cohesion]] and [[patriotism]] within the country. In 1968, citizens were allowed to use their pension fund ([[Central Provident Fund]]) to purchase and own the homes they were renting to give them a stake of the country and as an incentive to work hard. In 1989, the Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) was introduced to promote [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial integration]]. To prevent [[social class|social stratification]] that may lead to social conflict, the housing of different income groups is mixed together in [[Housing estate|estates]] and [[new towns]].\n\nIn the 1990s, the HDB concentrated on upgrading existing older flats, installing new facilities such as [[elevator|lift]]s that stop on every floor. [[Studio apartment]]s were specially built to suit the needs of senior citizens in Singapore's ageing society.\n\nOn 1 July 2003, the Building & Development Division of HDB was corporatised to form HDB Corporation Pte. Ltd. (HDBCorp). HDBCorp was later renamed Surbana Corporation Pte. Ltd. HDB's [[headquarters]] was moved from [[Bukit Merah]] to its new premises at the HDB Hub at 480 Lorong 6 [[Toa Payoh]] on 10 June 2002.\n\nThe existing Bukit Merah premises, known as Surbana One, became the headquarters for [[Surbana Corporation Pte.
