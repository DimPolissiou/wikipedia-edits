Marshall Unger]].  Essentially, they postulate that no ''full'' writing system can be completely pictographic or ideographic; it must be able to refer directly to a language in order to have the full expressive capacity of a language.  Unger disputes claims made on behalf of [[Blissymbols]] in his 2004 book ''Ideogram''.\n\nAlthough a few [[pictographic script|pictographic]] or [[ideographic script]]s exist today, there is no single way to read them, because there is no one-to-one correspondence between symbol and language.  Hieroglyphs were commonly thought to be ideographic before they were translated, and to this day Chinese is often erroneously said to be ideographic.<ref>Halliday, M.A.K., ''Spoken and written language,'' Deakin University Press, 1985, p.19</ref> In some cases of ideographic scripts, only the author of a text can read it with any certainty, and it may be said that they are ''interpreted'' rather than read.  Such scripts often work best as mnemonic aids for oral texts, or as outlines that will be fleshed out in speech.\n\n*[[Adinkra symbols|Adinkra]], traditionally used in modern Ghana, by groups such as the [[Ashanti people|Asante]] people.\n*[[Aztec writing|Aztec]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]{{spaced ndash}} Although some proper nouns have phonetic components.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Mike|title=The Aztecs|year=1997|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=0-631-23015-7}}</ref>\n*[[Kaid\u0101 glyphs]]\n*[[Mixtec writing|Mixtec]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtec]]\n*[[Dongba script|Dongba]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Naxi language|Naxi]]{{spaced ndash}} Although this is often supplemented with syllabic [[Geba script]].\n*[[Ersu Shaba script|Ersu ''Sh\u0101b\u0101'']] \u2013 [[Ersu language|Ersu]]\n*[[Lusona]], traditionally used by ethnic groups in modern [[Angola|Eastern Angola]] and [[Zambia|North Western Zambia]], and nearby regions in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], especially by the [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] and [[Luchazi]] peoples.\n*[[M\u00edkmaq hieroglyphic writing]]{{spaced ndash}} [[M\u00edkmaq]]{{spaced ndash}} Does have phonetic components, however.\n*[[Nsibidi]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Ekoid languages|Ekoi]], [[Efik language|Efik/Ibibio]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]]\n*[[Ojibwe writing systems#Ojibwe \"hieroglyphs\"|Ojibwe \"hieroglyphs\"]]\n*[[Siglas poveiras]]\n*[[Testerian]] \u2013 used for missionary work in Mexico\n*Other [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] with the exception of [[Maya script|Maya Hieroglyphs]].\n\nThere are also symbol systems used to represent things other than language, or to represent constructed languages.

All contain graphemes that represent [[phonetic]] (sound-based) elements as well. These phonetic elements may be used on their own (to represent, for example, grammatical inflections or foreign words), or may serve as [[phonetic complement]]s to a logogram (used to specify the sound of a logogram that might otherwise represent more than one word). In the case of Chinese, the phonetic element is built into the logogram itself; in Egyptian and Mayan, many glyphs are purely phonetic, whereas others function as either logograms or phonetic elements, depending on context. For this reason, many such scripts may be more properly referred to as logosyllabic or complex scripts; the terminology used is largely a product of custom in the field, and is to an extent arbitrary.\n\n===Consonant-based logographies===\n*[[Egyptian hieroglyph|Hieroglyphic]], [[Hieratic]], and [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] \u2013 the writing systems of [[Ancient Egypt]]\n**[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]\n***[[List of Egyptian hieroglyphs by common name: A-L]]\n***[[List of Egyptian hieroglyphs by common name: M-Z]]\n\n===Syllable-based logographies===\n*[[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s \u2013 [[Luwian language|Luwian]]\n*[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] \u2013 [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], other [[Semitic languages]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Luwian language|Luwian]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Urartian language|Urartian]]\n*[[Chinese character]]s (Hanzi) \u2013 [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (called [[Kanji]]), [[Korean language|Korean]] (called [[Hanja]]), [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (called [[Chu Nom]], obsolete), [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]] [[Sawndip]]\n**[[Jurchen script]] \u2013 [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]]\n**[[Khitan large script]] \u2013 [[Khitan language|Khitan]]\n**[[Tangut script]] \u2013 [[Tangut language|Tangut]] \n*[[Eghap script|Eghap (or Bagam)]] script\n*[[Maya script|Mayan]] \u2013 [[Chorti language|Chorti]], [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]], and other [[Classic Maya language]]s\n*[[Yi script#Classical Yi|Yi]] (classical) \u2013 various [[Yi language|Yi/Lolo languages]]\n*[[Sui language#Script|Shui script]] \u2013 [[Shui language]]\n\n== Syllabaries ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Syllabary]] -->\nIn a [[syllabary]], graphemes represent [[syllable]]s or [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]s.

In the case of Old Persian, all vowels were written regardless, so it was ''effectively'' a true alphabet despite its syllabic component. In Japanese a similar system plays a minor role in foreign borrowings; for example, [tu] is written [to]+[u], and [ti] as [te]+[i]. Paleohispanic [[semi-syllabaries]] behaved as a [[syllabary]] for the [[stop consonant]]s and as an [[alphabet]] for the rest of consonants and vowels. The Tartessian or Southwestern script is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic full semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a stop consonant was determined by the following vowel, as in a full [[semi-syllabary]], the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, others treat it as a redundant alphabet. Zhuyin is semi-syllabic in a different sense: it transcribes half syllables. That is, it has letters for [[syllable onset]]s and [[syllable rime|rimes]] ''(kan = \"k-an\")'' rather than for consonants and vowels ''(kan = \"k-a-n\").''\n\n*[[Paleohispanic scripts|Paleohispanic semi-syllabaries]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Paleo-Hispanic languages]]\n** [[Southwest Paleohispanic script|Tartessian or Southwestern script]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Tartessian language|Tartessian or Southwestern language]]\n** [[Southeastern Iberian script]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Iberian language]]\n** [[Northeastern Iberian script]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Iberian language]]\n** [[Celtiberian script]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Celtiberian language]]\n*[[Old Persian cuneiform]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Old Persian]]\n*[[Bopomofo|Bopomofo or Zhuyin fuhao]]{{spaced ndash}} phonetic script for the different [[varieties of Chinese]].\n*[[Eskayan script|Eskayan]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Bohol]], [[Philippines]] (a syllabary apparently based on an alphabet; some alphabetic characteristics remain)\n*[[Bamum script]]{{spaced ndash}}[[Bamum language|Bamum]] (a defective syllabary, with alphabetic principles used to fill the gaps)\n*[[Khom script]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Bahnaric languages]], including [[Alak language|Alak]] and [[Jru' language|Jru']].

The vast majority of abugidas are found from India to Southeast Asia and belong historically to the Br\u0101hm\u012b family, however the term is derived from the first characters of the abugida in [[Ge'ez script|Ge'ez]]: \u12a0 (A) \u1261 (bu) \u130a (gi) \u12f3 (da) \u2014 (compare with ''[[Alphabet#Etymology|alphabet]]'').

Marshall Unger]].  Essentially, they postulate that no ''full'' writing system can be completely pictographic or ideographic; it must be able to refer directly to a language in order to have the full expressive capacity of a language.  Unger disputes claims made on behalf of [[Blissymbols]] in his 2004 book ''Ideogram''.\n\nAlthough a few [[pictographic script|pictographic]] or [[ideographic script]]s exist today, there is no single way to read them, because there is no one-to-one correspondence between symbol and language.  Hieroglyphs were commonly thought to be ideographic before they were translated, and to this day Chinese is often erroneously said to be ideographic.<ref>Halliday, M.A.K., ''Spoken and written language,'' Deakin University Press, 1985, p.19</ref> In some cases of ideographic scripts, only the author of a text can read it with any certainty, and it may be said that they are ''interpreted'' rather than read.  Such scripts often work best as mnemonic aids for oral texts, or as outlines that will be fleshed out in speech.\n\n*[[Adinkra symbols|Adinkra]], traditionally used in modern Ghana, by groups such as the [[Ashanti people|Asante]] people.\n*[[Aztec writing|Aztec]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]]{{spaced ndash}} Although some proper nouns have phonetic components.<ref>{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Mike|title=The Aztecs|year=1997|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|location=Malden, MA|isbn=0-631-23015-7}}</ref>\n*[[Kaid\u0101 glyphs]]\n*[[Mixtec writing|Mixtec]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Mixtecan languages|Mixtec]]\n*[[Dongba script|Dongba]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Naxi language|Naxi]]{{spaced ndash}} Although this is often supplemented with syllabic [[Geba script]].\n*[[Ersu Shaba script|Ersu ''Sh\u0101b\u0101'']] \u2013 [[Ersu language|Ersu]]\n*[[Lusona]], traditionally used by ethnic groups in modern [[Angola|Eastern Angola]] and [[Zambia|North Western Zambia]], and nearby regions in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], especially by the [[Chokwe people|Chokwe]] and [[Luchazi]] peoples.\n*[[M\u00edkmaq hieroglyphic writing]]{{spaced ndash}} [[M\u00edkmaq]]{{spaced ndash}} Does have phonetic components, however.\n*[[Nsibidi]]{{spaced ndash}} [[Ekoid languages|Ekoi]], [[Efik language|Efik/Ibibio]], [[Igbo language|Igbo]]\n*[[Ojibwe writing systems#Ojibwe \"hieroglyphs\"|Ojibwe \"hieroglyphs\"]]\n*[[Siglas poveiras]]\n*[[Testerian]] \u2013 used for missionary work in Mexico\n*Other [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] with the exception of [[Maya script|Maya Hieroglyphs]].\n\nThere are also symbol systems used to represent things other than language, or to represent constructed languages.

All contain graphemes that represent [[phonetic]] (sound-based) elements as well. These phonetic elements may be used on their own (to represent, for example, grammatical inflections or foreign words), or may serve as [[phonetic complement]]s to a logogram (used to specify the sound of a logogram that might otherwise represent more than one word). In the case of Chinese, the phonetic element is built into the logogram itself; in Egyptian and Mayan, many glyphs are purely phonetic, whereas others function as either logograms or phonetic elements, depending on context. For this reason, many such scripts may be more properly referred to as logosyllabic or complex scripts; the terminology used is largely a product of custom in the field, and is to an extent arbitrary.\n\n===Consonant-based logographies===\n*[[Egyptian hieroglyph|Hieroglyphic]], [[Hieratic]], and [[Demotic Egyptian|Demotic]] \u2013 the writing systems of [[Ancient Egypt]]\n**[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]]\n***[[List of Egyptian hieroglyphs by common name: A-L]]\n***[[List of Egyptian hieroglyphs by common name: M-Z]]\n\n===Syllable-based logographies===\n*[[Anatolian hieroglyph]]s \u2013 [[Luwian language|Luwian]]\n*[[Cuneiform script|Cuneiform]] \u2013 [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], other [[Semitic languages]], [[Elamite language|Elamite]], [[Hittite language|Hittite]], [[Luwian language|Luwian]], [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]], and [[Urartian language|Urartian]]\n*[[Chinese character]]s (Hanzi) \u2013 [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (called [[Kanji]]), [[Korean language|Korean]] (called [[Hanja]]), [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] (called [[Chu Nom]], obsolete), [[Zhuang languages|Zhuang]] [[Sawndip]]\n**[[Jurchen script]] \u2013 [[Jurchen language|Jurchen]]\n**[[Khitan large script]] \u2013 [[Khitan language|Khitan]]\n**[[Tangut script]] \u2013 [[Tangut language|Tangut]] \n*[[Eghap script|Eghap (or Bagam)]] script\n*[[Maya script|Mayan]] \u2013 [[Chorti language|Chorti]], [[Yucatec Maya language|Yucatec]], and other [[Classic Maya language]]s\n*[[Yi script#Classical Yi|Yi]] (classical) \u2013 various [[Yi language|Yi/Lolo languages]]\n*[[Sui language#Script|Shui script]] \u2013 [[Shui language]]\n\n== Syllabaries ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Syllabary]] -->\nIn a [[syllabary]], graphemes represent [[syllable]]s or [[Mora (linguistics)|mora]]s.

In the case of Old Persian, all vowels were written regardless, so it was ''effectively'' a true alphabet despite its syllabic component. In Japanese a similar system plays a minor role in foreign borrowings; for example, [tu] is written [to]+[u], and [ti] as [te]+[i]. Paleohispanic [[semi-syllabaries]] behaved as a [[syllabary]] for the [[stop consonant]]s and as an [[alphabet]] for the rest of consonants and vowels. The Tartessian or Southwestern script is typologically intermediate between a pure alphabet and the Paleohispanic full semi-syllabaries. Although the letter used to write a stop consonant was determined by the following vowel, as in a full [[semi-syllabary]], the following vowel was also written, as in an alphabet. Some scholars treat Tartessian as a redundant semi-syllabary, others treat it as a redundant alphabet. Zhuyin is semi-syllabic in a different sense: it transcribes half syllables.

Alternative routes and corridors are always helpful for the domestic economy as well as regional connectivity. This was the biggest motivation for Waissi to initiate an alternative transit route, later called the Lapis Lazuli Transit and Transport Route. His ideas was accepted by [[Jawed Ludin]], former Deputy Foreign Minister of [[Afghanistan]] and later by Zarar Ahmad Osmani, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Afghanistan)|former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan]]. Waissi was being appointed immediately by Minister Osmani to follow with the concerned counties and coordinate to become a party to this initiative. Turkmenistan, [[Azerbaijan]] and Georgia immediately joined and [[Turkey]] was the last country to become as a party to this initiative.

From this, hundreds of small boat engine manufactures set up shop: [[Bolinder (company)|Bolinder]], [[Gray Marine Engine]], Kermath, [[Union Iron Works]], Caille, Palmer, Red Wing, St. Lawrence, and Buda; Sulzer, B and W, Gardner, and Ailsa Craig to mention a few.  [[Two-stroke engine]]s were popular for many years, however, the  parallel development of the auto engine, with their many cylinders, became a natural transposition.  Chrysler, Ford, [[Packard]], and Hudson also made marine engines.\n\n==Sizes==\n[[File:Yanmar 2GM20.JPG|thumb|A [[Yanmar 2GM20]] inboard marine [[diesel engine]], installed in a [[sailboat]].]]\n\nInboard motors may be of several types, suitable for the size of craft they are fitted to. Boats can use one cylinder to v12 engines, depending if they are used for racing or [[Troll (angling)|trolling]].\n\n===Small craft===\nFor pleasure craft, such as sailboats and speedboats, diesel, [[gasoline]] and electric<ref name=\"electric\">{{Cite web\n  |title=History\n  |website=Electric Boat Association \n  |url=http://www.eboat.org.uk/history.php\n}}</ref> engines are used.  Many inboard motors are derivatives of automobile engines, known as [[marine automobile engine]]s.  The advent of the [[stern drive]] propulsion leg improved design so that auto engines could easily power boats.\n\n===Large craft===\n\nFor larger craft, including ships (where outboard [[Marine propulsion|propulsion]] would in any case not be suitable) the propulsion system may include many types, such as [[Diesel engine|diesel]], [[gas turbine]], or even fossil-fuel or nuclear-generated steam. Some early models used coal for steam-driven ships.\n\n==Cooling==\n[[File:Liberty V12.jpg|thumb|Major [[Henry H. Arnold]] with the first Liberty engine. Aircraft engines were later used in boats.\nHap Arnold went on to command all US Airforces in WWII.]]\n\nSome inboard motors are freshwater cooled, while others have a raw [[water cooling]] system where water from the [[lake]], [[river]] or [[sea]] is pumped by the engine to cool it.\n\nHowever, as [[seawater]] is corrosive, and can damage engine blocks and cylinder heads, some seagoing craft have engines which are indirectly cooled via [[heat exchanger]] in a [[keel cooler]]. Other engines, notably small single and twin cylinder diesels specifically designed for marine use, use raw seawater for cooling and [[zinc]] sacrificial [[anode]]s are employed to protect the internal metal castings. \n\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Marine engines]]\n", "name_user": "HopsonRoad", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eHistory:link and ital.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inboard_motor"}
