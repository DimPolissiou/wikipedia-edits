On the way to her home, he learns that she has begun a relationship with Samir, the owner of a dry cleaning service and he is to share a room with Samir's son Fouad. At Marie's request, he speaks to her daughter from a previous marriage, Lucie, regarding her recent troubled behavior. Lucie disapproves of Marie's new relationship.\n\nAhmad and Marie attend court to complete their divorce. Just before the meeting with the officials, she tells him that she is pregnant with Samir's child. Ahmad continues to counsel Lucie, hoping to reconcile her to the situation. She reveals that Samir is still married and his wife is in coma after a suicide attempt, caused by the revelation that Samir and Marie were conducting an affair. Samir tells Ahmad that his wife suffered from depression and the suicide attempt was in fact caused by an incident with a customer in his shop. His wife was unaware of his affair and he arranges for Na\u00efma, his employee, who witnessed both the suicide attempt and the incident in the shop, to meet with Lucie.\n\nAfter hearing Na\u00efma's story, Lucie becomes distressed and confesses that she forwarded Marie's emails to Samir's wife the day before she tried to kill herself, after calling her at the dry cleaning shop. Lucie disappears and Ahmad and Samir search for her.  Ahmad finds Lucie, who has been staying with a friend, and tries to convince her to tell Marie what she did, saying that Marie has a right to know, now that she is carrying Samir's child. Lucie does so and Marie becomes enraged, telling Lucie to leave. Ahmad calms the situation and Lucie returns.\n\nAfter questioning what feelings he may still hold for his wife, Marie tells Samir what Lucie did. Samir finds this hard to accept and questions Na\u00efma about the events leading up his wife's suicide attempt. Na\u00efma states his wife wasn't even in the shop the day that Lucie said she called. After Marie accuses Lucie of lying, Lucie maintains her version of events saying that she spoke to a woman with an accent on the phone. Samir realizes that she actually spoke to Na\u00efma, who then gave Lucie his wife's email address. He confronts Na\u00efma, who confesses and explains that his wife had always been jealous of her and had been trying to get her either sacked or deported from France and had initiated the confrontation with the customer. However, Na\u00efma believes that his wife never read the emails, because she came into the shop and chose to drink bleach in front of her, instead of in front of Samir or Marie.\n\nSamir and Marie discuss the events and their relationship. Samir decides that they should focus on their future, while Marie appears conflicted. Ahmad prepares to return to Iran. He says farewell to the children and attempts to talk to Marie about the end of their marriage, but Marie does not let him, stating that she doesn't need to know such things now.

On the way to her home, he learns that she has begun a relationship with Samir, the owner of a dry cleaning service and he is to share a room with Samir's son Fouad. At Marie's request, he speaks to her daughter from a previous marriage, Lucie, regarding her recent troubled behavior. Lucie disapproves of Marie's new relationship.\n\nAhmad and Marie attend court to complete their [[divorce]]. Just before the meeting with the officials, she tells him that she is pregnant with Samir's child. Ahmad continues to counsel Lucie, hoping to reconcile her to the situation. She reveals that Samir is still married and his wife is in coma after a suicide attempt, caused by the revelation that Samir and Marie were conducting an affair. Samir tells Ahmad that his wife suffered from depression and the [[suicide]] attempt was in fact caused by an incident with a customer in his shop. His wife was unaware of his affair and he arranges for Na\u00efma, his employee, who witnessed both the suicide attempt and the incident in the shop, to meet with Lucie.\n\nAfter hearing Na\u00efma's story, Lucie becomes distressed and confesses that she forwarded Marie's emails to Samir's wife the day before she tried to kill herself, after calling her at the dry cleaning shop. Lucie disappears and Ahmad and Samir search for her.  Ahmad finds Lucie, who has been staying with a friend, and tries to convince her to tell Marie what she did, saying that Marie has a right to know, now that she is carrying Samir's child. Lucie does so and Marie becomes enraged, telling Lucie to leave. Ahmad calms the situation and Lucie returns.\n\nAfter questioning what feelings he may still hold for his wife, Marie tells Samir what Lucie did. Samir finds this hard to accept and questions Na\u00efma about the events leading up his wife's suicide attempt. Na\u00efma states his wife wasn't even in the shop the day that Lucie said she called. After Marie accuses Lucie of lying, Lucie maintains her version of events saying that she spoke to a woman with an accent on the phone. Samir realizes that she actually spoke to Na\u00efma, who then gave Lucie his wife's email address. He confronts Na\u00efma, who confesses and explains that his wife had always been jealous of her and had been trying to get her either sacked or deported from France and had initiated the confrontation with the customer. However, Na\u00efma believes that his wife never read the emails, because she came into the shop and chose to drink bleach in front of her, instead of in front of Samir or Marie.\n\nSamir and Marie discuss the events and their relationship. Samir decides that they should focus on their future, while Marie appears conflicted. Ahmad prepares to return to Iran. He says farewell to the children and attempts to talk to Marie about the end of their marriage, but Marie does not let him, stating that she doesn't need to know such things now. Meanwhile, Samir visits his wife in hospital with a selection of perfumes, which the doctors have recommended in order to possibly initiate a response. He sprays on some of his cologne and leans over her, asking her to squeeze his hand if she can smell it.

The original version aired on [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2 (Reshet)]], and hosted by [[Avi Kushnir]]. The show is distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures Television International.\n\n==Format==\nContestants in a pair face nine different rounds. One partner answers trivia questions on various topics, each question is worth a certain time in a cage with various prizes. The purpose of the challenger is to answer all nine questions and successfully complete the game, while providing maximum time to the partner each round to get as many prizes as possible.\n\n==Gameplay==\nInside the cage are various prizes with different values. There are ten rounds, in each round, one contestant must answer trivia questions and the other contestant must get in the cage to collect prizes.\n\n===Answer the question===\nAt the start of each round, the answerer is asked a trivia question with four options, which that contestant must answer correctly. Choosing the correct answer, the cage door will open, allowing the other contestant to get in the cage to start collecting prizes. That player may answer the question immediately, or use one of the lifelines:\n\n*'''Switch the Question:''' The question is replaced, and the answers remain the same (some international versions also changes the answers).\n*'''Switch Roles:''' Swapping two contestants for that round only. The contestant who gets the cage prizes answers the question and if the answer is correct, the contestant that answers the trivia questions gets inside the cage to collect prizes. Both contestants then return the original roles.\n\nCorrectly answering the question, the cage door will open for a certain amount of time (10 seconds for round 1, 20 seconds for round 2 and so on, up to 90 seconds for round 9). While answering in the first nine rounds, this contestant may not discuss with the prize-collecting contestant.\n\nIn the final round (tenth round), both contestants may discuss with each other to answer one final question, the Cage Question. If they managed to answer this question correctly, they automatically win all prizes in the cage.\n\nGiving an incorrect answer at any point ends the game, and the pair loses all prizes accumulated up to that point.\n\n===Collect prizes===\nIf the answerer answers the question correctly, the cage door will open for a certain amount of time (10 seconds for round 1, 20 seconds for round 2 and so on, up to 90 seconds for round 9). The prize collector may choose between regular prizes that may be collected immediately, while some larger prizes may require completing a physical challenge before collecting.\n\nBoth contestants may consult in this phase, but there are no timekeeping devices to keep track of time. The prize-collecting contestant must pay attention to the time remaining and get out of the cage before the cage door closes.\n\nAt the end of the time limit, the door will close. If the contestant is still trapped in the cage, the game is over and the pair loses all prizes accumulated up to that point.\n\nIn the final round (tenth round), the contestant may consult with the answerer for the Cage Question. If they managed to answer this question correctly, they automatically win all prizes in the cage.\n\n===Ending the game===\nAfter collecting prizes for the fifth round, the pair may choose to retire from the game with all prizes collected or continue playing. Both contestants can consult the option they choose. If they choose to continue, they may also retire from the game after any later round, provided that they have completed both the answer phase and the prize-collecting phase for that round.\n\nGiving an incorrect answer at any point, or failing to get out of the cage at the end of the time alloted ends the game and the pair loses all prizes accumulated up to that point.\n\n==Tasks==\n\nFor great prizes like a new car, tickets to Europe and appliances, the contestants have various tasks (in original version and some foreign versions):\n\n*'''Electrical appliances: Star Task''' - the challenger on the cage must jump on the touch screen. On every star he steps on, he gets a star, and on every red square he steps on, he loses a star. When eight stars are collected, a stroller with Electrical appliances is freed, and the contestant can get it out of the cage.\n*'''ATV: Hamster task''' - the challenger must run on a big hamster wheel to reveal a key to open the lock of the ATV and the contestant could get it out.\n*'''Motorcycle: Safe task''' - the challenger to go to the strongboxes which have questions related to both team members. A correct answer opens the box and reveals the following question. which opened three safes safe third has a key to open the lock of the bike and the challenger can take it out (the same task can be performed With a diamond ring in the case of couples).\n*'''Sailing a variety of destinations around the world: mission suitcases''' - the contenders to take a cart and assign it the bags and take them out that has cruise.\n*'''Car task: Superhero Task''' - the challenger must face the screen and make flight movements. when he sees a car he/she should smash the glass three times so the car is released and he/she can take it. Normally there's a person sit inside to drive and turn the car to the right way.\n*''' Bathroom task: bubble task''' - the contestant should look for a bubble with a key that can open the box between all the bubbles and get the bathroom.\n*'''Living items: balloon task''' - The contestant must bounce on a seat to inflate the balloon to explode so he/she can take the key to open the box that awards the challenger the living room.\n*'''Vacation abroad: Bicycle task''' - The constestant must ride on a bike simulator that its map simulates a section of [[Rome]], so he/she can take a globe and win the vacation.\n\nThe tasks are varied among the broadcasting countries, for example, in the Chinese version, there is a real \"[[Angry Birds]]\" game in the center of the studio.\n\n==International versions==\n{{colorbox|silver}} Non-broadcast pilot\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

The original version aired on [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2 (Reshet)]], and hosted by [[Avi Kushnir]]. The show is distributed worldwide by Sony Pictures Television International.\n\n==Format==\nContestants in a pair face nine different rounds. One partner answers trivia questions on various topics, each question is worth a certain time in a cage with various prizes. The purpose of the challenger is to answer all nine questions and successfully complete the game, while providing maximum time to the partner each round to get as many prizes as possible.\n\n==Gameplay==\nInside the cage are various prizes with different values. There are ten rounds, in each round, one contestant must answer trivia questions and the other contestant must get in the cage to collect prizes.\n\n===Answer the question===\nAt the start of each round, the answerer is asked a trivia question with four options, which that contestant must answer correctly. Choosing the correct answer, the cage door will open, allowing the other contestant to get in the cage to start collecting prizes. That player may answer the question immediately, or use one of the lifelines:\n\n*'''Switch the Question:''' The question is replaced, and the answers remain the same (some international versions also changes the answers).\n*'''Switch Roles:''' Swapping two contestants for that round only. The contestant who gets the cage prizes answers the question and if the answer is correct, the contestant that answers the trivia questions gets inside the cage to collect prizes. Both contestants then return the original roles.\n\nCorrectly answering the question, the cage door will open for a certain amount of time (10 seconds for round 1, 20 seconds for round 2 and so on, up to 90 seconds for round 9). While answering in the first nine rounds, this contestant may not discuss with the prize-collecting contestant.\n\nIn the final round (tenth round), both contestants may discuss with each other to answer one final question, the Cage Question. If they managed to answer this question correctly, they automatically win all prizes in the cage.\n\nGiving an incorrect answer at any point ends the game, and the pair loses all prizes accumulated up to that point.\n\n===Collect prizes===\nIf the answerer answers the question correctly, the cage door will open for a certain amount of time (10 seconds for round 1, 20 seconds for round 2 and so on, up to 90 seconds for round 9). The prize collector may choose between regular prizes that may be collected immediately, while some larger prizes may require completing a physical challenge before collecting.\n\nBoth contestants may consult in this phase, but there are no timekeeping devices to keep track of time. The prize-collecting contestant must pay attention to the time remaining and get out of the cage before the cage door closes.\n\nAt the end of the time limit, the door will close. If the contestant is still trapped in the cage, the game is over and the pair loses all prizes accumulated up to that point.\n\nIn the final round (tenth round), the contestant may consult with the answerer for the Cage Question. If they managed to answer this question correctly, they automatically win all prizes in the cage.\n\n===Ending the game===\nAfter collecting prizes for the fifth round, the pair may choose to retire from the game with all prizes collected or continue playing. Both contestants can consult the option they choose. If they choose to continue, they may also retire from the game after any later round, provided that they have completed both the answer phase and the prize-collecting phase for that round.\n\nGiving an incorrect answer at any point, or failing to get out of the cage at the end of the time alloted ends the game and the pair loses all prizes accumulated up to that point.\n\n==Tasks==\n\nFor great prizes like a new car, tickets to Europe and appliances, the contestants have various tasks (in original version and some foreign versions):\n\n*'''Electrical appliances: Star Task''' - the challenger on the cage must jump on the touch screen. On every star he steps on, he gets a star, and on every red square he steps on, he loses a star. When eight stars are collected, a stroller with Electrical appliances is freed, and the contestant can get it out of the cage.\n*'''ATV: Hamster task''' - the challenger must run on a big hamster wheel to reveal a key to open the lock of the ATV and the contestant could get it out.\n*'''Motorcycle: Safe task''' - the challenger to go to the strongboxes which have questions related to both team members. A correct answer opens the box and reveals the following question. which opened three safes safe third has a key to open the lock of the bike and the challenger can take it out (the same task can be performed With a diamond ring in the case of couples).\n*'''Sailing a variety of destinations around the world: mission suitcases''' - the contenders to take a cart and assign it the bags and take them out that has cruise.\n*'''Car task: Superhero Task''' - the challenger must face the screen and make flight movements. when he sees a car he/she should smash the glass three times so the car is released and he/she can take it. Normally there's a person sit inside to drive and turn the car to the right way.\n*''' Bathroom task: bubble task''' - the contestant should look for a bubble with a key that can open the box between all the bubbles and get the bathroom.\n*'''Living items: balloon task''' - The contestant must bounce on a seat to inflate the balloon to explode so he/she can take the key to open the box that awards the challenger the living room.\n*'''Vacation abroad: Bicycle task''' - The constestant must ride on a bike simulator that its map simulates a section of [[Rome]], so he/she can take a globe and win the vacation.\n\nThe tasks are varied among the broadcasting countries, for example, in the Chinese version, there is a real \"[[Angry Birds]]\" game in the center of the studio.\n\n==International versions==\n{{colorbox|silver}} Non-broadcast pilot\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;

New Haven: Yale University Press. 1999.</ref> He received his doctorate in medicine in 1912 in [[T\u00fcbingen]] for a dissertation on [[tuberculosis]]. Sexual medicine interested him, but was not part of his medical studies. In an interview conducted in 1985 he recalled:\n\n{{quote|I do remember going, as a young person, to a lecture by [[Auguste Forel]], whose book ''The Sexual Question'' was a sensation at the time and which impressed me greatly. I also met [[Magnus Hirschfeld]] very early on through a girl friend, who knew the police official Kopp, who was in charge investigating of sexual offenses.

Reaching the centrepiece of the Maze, \"The Crystal Dome\", the team work together collecting a certain amount of gold tokens to win a prize, with the allotted time inside the Dome being determined by the number of crystals they obtained in the previous zones.\n\nBroadcast on [[Channel 4]] in the United Kingdom, ''The Crystal Maze'' was originally aired over six series and five Christmas specials between 15 February 1990 to 10 August 1995; the first four series and three specials were hosted by [[Richard O'Brien]], with the remaining two series and specials hosted by [[Edward Tudor-Pole]]. The show's format is an adapted version of the French game show ''[[Fort Boyard (TV series)|Fort Boyard]]'', also created by Antoine.\n\nIn October 2016, [[Stephen Merchant]] hosted a one-off celebrity edition of the show for ''[[Stand Up to Cancer UK|Stand Up to Cancer]]''. Channel 4 announced the return of the show a month later, to be hosted by [[Richard Ayoade]] and featuring a revamped format.

During a visit to Paris, the producers were taken to a warehouse in which stood a full-size Crystal Dome created by the French. Antoine showed the British producers a rough sketch of a set design with the dome in the middle of four other sets. This was used as inspiration for the concept of ''The Crystal Maze'' which was developed in just \"two days\", creating a show which although similar to ''Fort Boyard'', was substantially different in presentation and style. According to Richard O'Brien, who was selected to be the host for this project, the original outlined concept was \"kind of like \"[[Dungeons and Dragons]]\", with the host acting as the \"[[Dungeon master]]\".<ref name=\"fortboyardpilot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.robcrusade.com/articles/adhoc.html |title=Interview from adhoc.com |publisher=The Richard O'Brien Crusade |date= |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was later adapted in France for children under the title of ''[[:fr:Les Mondes fantastiques#Histoire|Les Mondes fantastiques]]'' (''Fantastic worlds'') and broadcast from 9 September 1992 to 15 November 1995 on [[France 3]].\n\n==Format==\n{{for|the games used in \"The Crystal Maze\"|List of The Crystal Maze games}}\nEach team that compete on ''The Crystal Maze'' undertake a series of challenges (referred to as games). Teams begin at a pre-determined zone, whereupon they compete in a finite number of games in each zone, accruing as many time crystals as they can before travelling to the large \"Crystal Dome\" at the centre of the maze to meet their final challenge. Upon entering a game's cell, the objective is usually determined by either a clear written message or cryptic clue. The remainder of the team watch their progress either through a cell's windows or monitors depending on the zone aesthetic, and may give advice to the contestant unless stipulated otherwise. The host will serve reminders of the time limit and of any special rules, and generally will not give hints unless the contestant is struggling badly.\n\nEach game falls under one of four categories:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of ''The Crystal Maze'' Categories\n|-\n! Category\n! Description\n|-\n| {{nowrap|Mental}}\n| Mental and memory skill ranging from simple brainteasers, to acute memory and 2D/3D puzzles.\n|-\n| {{nowrap|Mystery}}\n|  Testing a contestant's problem solving abilities ranging from [[Scavenger Hunts|treasure hunts]] to large-scale mazes.\n|-\n| {{nowrap|Physical}}\n| Testing a contestant's physical abilities ranging from obstacle courses, to lifting, using, cranking, or manipulating objects.\n|-\n| {{nowrap|Skill}}\n| Testing a contestant's [[dexterity]], [[accuracy]] and eye\u2013hand coordination ranging from target-shooting, timing tests, to vehicle driving.\n|-\n|}\n\nEach game presents the potential of being locked within a game's cell. If locked in, the contestant is unable to take any further part in proceedings unless they are released by their team captain at the cost of an earned Crystal. If the team's captain is locked in, the vice-captain takes over and may select a new vice-captain to replace them and so on. Reduction in team members poses an increased difficulty for future games and at their final challenge.\n\nThere are two ways a lock-in can occur in ''The Crystal Maze'', if a contestant exceeds their time limit within the cell or if they breach a game's special rules or restrictions, irrespective of their progress in obtaining the crystal. This is outlined prior to a contestant entering the cell by the Maze Master.\n\nOnce the team arrives at the Crystal Dome, they are told how much time that they have to complete the final challenge, based on the number of crystals they have brought with them (five seconds for each crystal they had at the end of the game). At this point, the team enter the Dome, and upon the challenge beginning, they must collect as many gold foil tokens as they can and deposit them into a container along a wall of the Dome, while avoiding any silver tokens mixed in with them; these are blown about by fans beneath the floor of the Dome. Once time is up, the fans are switched off and no more tokens can be deposited into the container; a slot is opened during the challenge, which closes up when the time is up. Once the team is outside the dome, they, along with any members who were not present for the final challenge, are given the tally of their efforts by the host. If the team accumulate a total of 100 gold tokens or more, after deduction of any silver tokens, the team wins the grand prize that they chose for themselves before partaking in the show. All contestants who participate in the show win a commemorative crystal saying \"I Cracked the Crystal Maze\", which acts as a [[consolation prize]] if a team fails to secure the required number of gold tokens.<ref name=\"faq\">{{cite web|url=http://crystalmaze.marcgerrish.com/faq.htm |title=FAQ |publisher=CrystalMaze.MarcGerrish.com |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Original series ===\nDuring the run of the original series between 1990 and 1995, teams consisted of three men and three women, each aged between 16 and 40, who were put together by the production team and did not know each other before appearing on the show<ref name=\"boblishman\">{{cite web|last=Lishman|first=Bob|url=http://www.boblishman.com/CrystalMaze/|title=The Unofficial Crystal Maze Website |publisher=boblishman.com |date= |accessdate=17 Oct 2017}}</ref> From their pre-determined starting zone, teams either travelled clockwise or counter-clockwise around the maze, engaging in at least three games in each zone, sometimes being given the opportunity to play a fourth game in a zone during their trip around the maze. Between the first and fourth series, the total number of games that could be played varied between 14 and 16 per episode, but for the fifth and sixth series, the number of games played was reduced to standard of 13. Throughout the run, 3D maps of varying sophistication were used to highlight where the host and team were. Until the end of the third series, each contestant on the team could win a prize for themselves that they chose before taking on the Maze if the team succeeded at collecting 100 or more gold tokens, but from the fourth series, this format was changed to the team choosing a prize that they shared together if they won the final challenge. During the first series, a runner-up prize could also be chosen by each member of a team, which they won if the final tally of tokens was between 50 and 99, but this format was dropped by the start of the second series.  \n\nDuring the Christmas specials, the teams consisted of similar setup, with each aged between 8 and 16,{{Citation needed|reason=Need someone to double check this age range is correct|date=July 2017}} and selected by the production team. While the format was similar to the adult version, there were notable differences, such as easier games with fewer chances of a lock-in, more lenient time limits and additional clues from the host. The prize would always be awarded at the end, irrespective of achievement.\n\n=== Revived series ===\nFollowing the one-off ''Stand Up to Cancer'' edition, Channel 4 revived the show featuring the original setup of zones, the same map design from the ''SU2C'' special, and a newly designed taller set. The format of the show was revamped to have five contestants who have a prior connection (family, colleagues, etc.) and a reduction in games to ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/tv/how-apply-new-series-crystal-12475591|title=Crystal Maze is coming back... and they're looking for contestants|first=Sheena|last=McStravick|date=19 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn a similar vein to the 2016 ''SU2C'' special, a series of celebrity episodes was initially broadcast. The contestants taking part were given an extra crystal upon reaching the Dome (or by completing an additional task during the show) to add to those that they had brought, and would earn cash for ''Stand Up to Cancer'' depending on how many gold tokens they got, after deduction of silver \u00a35,000 for less than 50 gold tokens, \u00a310,000 for 50 to 99 tokens, and \u00a320,000 for 100 or more tokens.\n\nThe 2019 series introduces the \"Mega Crystal\", a noticeably larger version of the Crystals within the Maze. The team has one opportunity to earn the Mega Crystal, and the team captain decides before each game whether they want that game to be played for the Mega Crystal. If the team earns the Mega Crystal, it grants them ten seconds of time (instead of the standard five) in the Crystal Dome.\n\n== Hosts ==\nThroughout its history, ''The Crystal Maze'' has been presented by a series of hosts known as Maze Masters. Each takes on the role of the Adam Conover responsible for guiding each team around the various zones, keeping them updated on their progress, leading each nominated team member to the respective games, acting as the timekeeper on all games and the final challenge at the Dome, and taking safe custody of each crystal won by the team.\n\nThe [[breaking the fourth wall|short monologue to camera]] scenes originated when O'Brien began joking with the cameramen during filming of an episode. When the production team reviewed the footage and realized what it could bring to the show they \"asked him to do it all the time\", to which O'Brien felt that looking straight at the camera, \"unknowingly added a complicity between me and the audience at home\".<ref name=\"inside story\"/> However, he also \"often appeared detached from proceedings, bordering on deadpan\",<ref name=\"pinknews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/11/02/interview-the-rocky-horror-shows-richard-obrien/|date=2 November 2011|title=Interview: The Rocky Horror Show's Richard O'Brien|publisher=PinkNews|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref> Each successive host has continued these monologues, adding their own variant to the show.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of ''The Crystal Maze'' Hosts\n|-\n!

He was always broadly welcoming and encouraging to teams, being congratulatory on their successes, but would show visible frustration with a contestant for a particularly sub-standard attempt at a game, and would encourage them to use their allotted time effectively. During a game, O'Brien would produce a harmonica from his pocket during a game, and played one short and repetitive tune which he called \"excitement music\". On a number of occasions, he would 'find' other musical instruments in the maze, which were used to showcase his talents, even occasionally breaking into song. O'Brien would often comment that he built the games and would adapt them for future teams if a game was beaten quickly.

While his style of hosting had the similar energetic style to O'Brien's, it was less detached, with Tudor-Pole being more sympathetic towards contestants, and often talking up the '[[time travel]]' elements of the show, with the inclusion of nonsense words, such as \"trignification\" to describe the process of travelling between time zones, providing fictitious backstories of each zone while often referring to unseen companions in the maze, such as his horse \"Bert\" in Medieval Zone, and \"Starbuck\", a deranged cat, who lives in Ocean Zone.

Ayoade will frequently refer to contestants by their initials, colour jumpsuit (e.g. yellow [[Katie Price|Katie]]) or coin a nickname based on their performance in the Maze.\n|-\n|[[Adam Conover]]{{efn|name=Crystal Maze US|Adam Conover hosts the American version on ''[[Nickelodeon]]''.}}\n| {{nowrap|2020\u2013present}}\n| The first host of the American version, Conover is dressed in a tailor-made suit with a [[brooch]] on his left lapel. In the show, Conover describes his role as an \"ageless trickster spirit\" who actively encourages teams, and is inquisitive about their lives before entering the Maze. Throughout the show, Conover tells the audience and teams a combination of real and fictitious tales of events that happened in each zone similar to his role on ''[[Adam Ruins Everything]]''.\n|}\n\n=== Other characters ===\nWhilst the Maze is home to the Maze Master, several original characters have appeared whether as part of a particular game such as a jailor, guard and tribal priest, or are otherwise fictionalized within a respective zone. Notable characters include:\n\n* '''Mumsie and Auntie Sabrina''' Portrayed by Sandra Caron, Mumsie is a genial fortune teller during O'Brien's tenure, hosting a recurring mental game in the Medieval Zone that involved [[brain teaser]] questions; Caron portrayed Mumsie for the first, second and fourth series of the original run, and Auntie Sabrina for the third series, who was described by O'Brien as taking over while his Mumsie was away. Both characters were portrayed as friendly to the contestants, with Mumsie sometimes being overly motherly with O'Brien, and often talked about her affair she was having with a man called \"Ralph\" to both the contestants and audience during the first and second series, showing disapproval of her next affair with man called \"Dwayne\" during the fourth series. Mumsie departed with O'Brien at the start of the fifth series. In [[The_Crystal_Maze#The_Crystal_Maze_Live_Experience|The Crystal Maze Live Experience]], Mumsie is an [[unseen character]] which the Maze Master communicates with through an earpiece.\n* '''The Computer''' An operating system for the Futuristic Zone is situated within; if the team's starting point is this zone, the computer provides a question for the team that they must answer correctly to gain entry into the Maze. During O'Brien's tenure (with the exception of series 2), the computer had a male voice and usually acted antagonistically towards him. During Tudor-Pole's tenure, the computer adopted a female voice and was named Barbara. In Ayoade's tenure, the computer retains a female voice but no other personality traits are shown, only speaking when a team seeks entry to the maze.\n* '''The Riddle Master''' Portrayed by [[Adam Buxton]], the Riddle Master, credited as Jarhead, is a head that resides in a glass jar who creates Crystals by mixing potions using [[telekinesis]] when a contestant completes his game. Though primarily in the Futuristic zone, he has appeared in other zones where his jar changes aesthetic. He has a friendly, though seemingly subservient, relationship to Ayoade.\n* '''Knight Marion'''{{efn|name=TheKnight|In the episode \u201cThe Ali Family\u201d, the Knight introduces herself as Marion in the Medieval zone.}} Portrayed by [[Jessica Hynes]], Marion is a King's Knight and guard of the Medieval Zone who wears oversized battle armour, carries a large sword, and grants entry. She was known to ask Ayoade to attend events with her, which he rebuffed. When Medieval was replaced with Eastern, she did not return.\n\n==Filming==\nEach episode had a budget of \u00a3125,000 and was filmed over a period of two days at the show's studio. During the first day of shooting, the team, followed by multiple cameras, tackle all the games and discover their fate in the crystal dome in the style of a \"live\" shoot. The following day then focuses on acquiring close-up shots of gameplay with a single camera, requiring team members to return to games they had already won or lost, along with redoing the last challenge in the dome to get footage of them grabbing for tokens. An entire series requires about five weeks to be filmed, with three episodes produced per week.<ref name=\"inside story\">Patrick Smith, [https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/to-the-crystal-dome The Inside Story Of \"The Crystal Maze\", The Most Epic Game Show Ever Made], ''[[BuzzFeed]]'', 18 May 2015</ref> Each series of the show featured its own portfolio of games: 37 different game designs in series 1, and between 41 and 49 games in each subsequent series.<ref name=\"BBCinsideCrystalMaze\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40354288 |title=The Crystal Maze: Inside the new zones |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=19 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"seriesindex\">{{cite web|url=http://crystalmaze.marcgerrish.com/series/index.htm |title=Series |publisher=CrystalMaze.MarcGerrish.com |date= |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===The set===\nEvery episode, with the exception of the 2016 special, is filmed on a very large custom built set. The set, designed by James Dillon for both the original run and the revived series, is divided into five parts, four of which are named as zones, set in different periods of time and space, which house the games that contestants take on, while the final part, called the Crystal Dome, houses the final challenge that the team tackle together towards the end of the episode.<ref name=\"BBCinsideCrystalMaze\"/><ref name=\"RadioTimesHITSD\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-07-07/the-crystal-maze-how-is-the-new-series-different-to-the-original |title=The Crystal Maze: How is the new series different to the original? |magazine=The Radio Times |accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref> The theme of each zone is not only reflected via its time period, but also in the time-keeping devices, the design of the games, and how the host and team entered and moves between the zones.

Exiting in the original series was either a tunnel leading off towards Industrial/Ocean, and a set of steps to a ledge heading towards Futuristic though in the revived series the latter is implemented for all zone transitions.

The zone was used for three series in the original run, with teams able to watch their nominated member's efforts in a game via one of a number of monitors used in the zone. Industrial was brought back for the revived series, maintaining the same design style as the original, though with teams able to watch proceedings in a game via either monitors or panels that opened into a cell. Entry into this zone was initially designed towards finding a key to unlock a chain-mesh gate, but later changed towards finding a way over it and around a number of small obstacles, with stairs leading to an upper floor passage towards Medieval, and a pipeline tunnel towards Aztec. In the American version of the show, Industrial is green on the map.\n|[[Analogue clock]]\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"royalblue\" | \n| rowspan=3 | '''Futuristic'''\n| rowspan=2 | Series 1\u20136{{efn|name=FuturisticOriginal|In series 1 - 3 the Futuristic zone was coloured blue on the 3D map and changed to gray from series 4 - 6 when [[#Former zones|Ocean zone]] was introduced.}}\n| rowspan=2 | Designed as a [[space station]], orbiting an unknown planet in the distant [[future]]. Futuristic was designed as run down, with metal sliding doors, exposed wiring, viewpoints that looked out into space with monitors spread over the station to view inside the cells, and cell doors having a keypad next to them where the host punched a code into to allow access. Entry was designed around an airlock setup, with a computer panel the host used to boot up the station's computer and request a question for the team, with a passage leading off towards Medieval, and a lift that allowed the host and team to shift between a walkway and a ledge connecting to Aztec.\n| rowspan=3 | [[Digital clock]]\n|- \n| bgcolor=\"silver\" | \n|-\n| bgcolor=\"royalblue\" | \n| 2016\u2013present\n| For the revival, the station was clean and sleek, with a central console for contestants to view games set on [[lazy susan|rotating floor]] with three corridors that housed the games with the cell doors no longer requiring an access code. Entry and exit to the zone was via an airlock similar to the original series, with entry determined by answering a question by the computer (if Futuristic was the starting zone) and exiting was by the same method by stepping on a '[[Teleportation|teleporter pad]]' to traverse between zones.\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"red\" | \n|'''Eastern'''\n| 2019\u2013present\n|Themed around the architecture and iconography of [[East Asia]] with a lily pond, ornate vases, lanterns, and solid colors throughout.

Teams are able to watch proceedings in a game by drawing back curtains in the cell or a circular hatch on the cell door. Exiting the zone is via jumping across oversized lily pads.\n| [[Pendulum clock]]\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"white\" | \n|'''Crystal Dome'''\n| Series 1\u20136<br>2016\u2013present\n|A 16-foot (4.9 m) model for the show's time crystals, located in the centre of the Maze. The interior is designed with rails for the team to hold onto before the final challenge begins, with a mesh floor and a series of fans below the base which activate on the host's command, blowing foil tokens around. The exterior differs between the original run, one-off special and revived series, but always provided the host with a small hexagonal podium designed to hold the team's acquired crystals. Each crystal is illuminated from below by lights which are deactivated sequentially at intervals of five seconds, serving as a countdown. The challenge is over when all crystals are dark. In the original series the Dome featured an encircling moat with the podium having two switches with which the host controlled a moat bridge and door to the Dome. For the revived series, the moat and switches were retired and the Dome redesigned to feature a set of flashing lights (Red to cease collecting tokens, Gold for achieving the top prize, etc.) The opening scene of each episode often comprises a greeting from the host from in front of the dome with tokens flying within.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n|[[The Crystal Maze#Format|Time crystals]]\n|}\n\n=== Former zones ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | Zone\n!Appearances\n!Description\n!Method of timekeeping\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"forestgreen\" | \n|'''Medieval'''\n| Series 1\u20136<br>2016\u20132018\n|This is designed as a castle of the [[Middle Ages]], laden with a straw covered [[flagstone]] floor, wooden barrels, and a large dining table with solid wooden chairs.

This zone was referred within the show as the homestead of the Maze Master. Entry into this zone was initially done by contestants raising the portcullis at the castle's entrance by finding the right chain, and then later having to climb over it. In the revived series, this method was changed to simply answering a riddle to open a portcullis. The zone was designed with a passage that led to Futuristic via a beam that had to be crossed, and a set of stairs that had to be crossed to get to Industrial/Ocean, later this was changed to a set of ledges that had to be traversed. Medieval was later replaced with Eastern in the 2019 series.\n|[[Hourglass|Hourglasses]]\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"darkturquoise\" | \n|'''Ocean'''\n| Series 4\u20136\n|A replacement to the Industrial zone from 1993 to 1995, this zone was designed as a [[Shipwreck|sunken ship]] called the SS ''Atlantis'', held within an air bubble at the bottom of the ocean, and consisted of a saloon with an elegant staircase, wooden panelling, couches, a grand piano, covered furniture and objects and upper walkway, a boiler room, and maintenance corridors, with cells designed as either maintenance rooms, the interior of one of the ship's boilers, or refined cabins. Entry was designed around climbing down from the bridge into the boiler room via a rope ladder, with a hatchway at the top of a ladder leading to Medieval, and a ventilation shaft leading towards Aztec.\n|Analogue clocks\n|-\n|}\n\n===Location===\nFor the first series, the show was filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]], within a stage set measuring {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} and containing a water tank on-site. After the first series, the production team decided to expand the maze, relocating the set to an adapted aircraft hangar, Hangar 6, operated by Aces High Studios at [[North Weald Airfield]] in [[Essex]]. After the show ended in 1995, when [[Channel 4]]'s contract with producers Chatsworth TV expired, the set was eventually dismantled. When the broadcaster decided to make a one-off edition of the show for ''Stand Up for Cancer'' in 2016, the episode was filmed at The Crystal Maze live immersive experience in London, as it was no longer possible to use the original set. When Channel 4 made the decision to revive the show for a full series in November 2016, James Dillon was asked to design a new set at a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} warehouse at [[The Bottle Yard Studios]] in [[Bristol]].<ref name=\"somersetlive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.somersetlive.co.uk/the-new-crystal-maze-series-with-richard-ayoade-will-be-filmed-in-bristol-and-you-can-take-part/story-30066838-detail/story.html |title=New Crystal Maze series, with Richard Ayoade, will be filmed in Bristol |date= |accessdate=17 January 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Dillon went back to his original plans and sketches but took the opportunity to build and expand on several of his original ideas and concepts. The most drastic change is that the Crystal Dome is actually located in a separate part of the studio; originally its proximity to the Aztec zone caused a problem with sand contaminating the Dome area.<ref name=\"BBCinsideCrystalMaze\" />\n\n===Theme tune===\nThe theme tune for ''The Crystal Maze'' was composed by [[Zack Laurence]] and is entitled \"Force Field\". It was used through all six original series, with an updated version being used for the new series. The original track is one minute and five seconds long; however it was shortened for the opening and ending titles. Likewise, the new re-recorded version of the theme lasts for 33 seconds. The \"Underscore\" remix of the theme tune played during the show itself was also composed by Laurence.<ref name=\"BBCmusicpage\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/music/records/n35zzr|title=Forcefield |date=25 January 2017 |accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nAt its most popular, viewing figures regularly scored over 4 million, peaking at 5.9 million in 1992 when the show was nominated for its first [[BAFTA]] award.

labyrinth of the same name consisting of four time zones, winning a \"time crystal\" (golf ball-sized [[Swarovski]] glass crystals) for each one they successfully complete. Reaching the centrepiece of the Maze, \"The Crystal Dome\", the team work together collecting a certain amount of gold tokens to win a prize, with the allotted time inside the Dome being determined by the number of crystals they obtained in the previous zones.\n\nBroadcast on [[Channel 4]] in the United Kingdom, ''The Crystal Maze'' was originally aired over six series and five Christmas specials between 15 February 1990 to 10 August 1995; the first four series and three specials were hosted by [[Richard O'Brien]], with the remaining two series and specials hosted by [[Edward Tudor-Pole]]. The show's format is an adapted version of the French game show ''[[Fort Boyard (TV series)|Fort Boyard]]'', also created by Antoine.\n\nIn October 2016, [[Stephen Merchant]] hosted a one-off celebrity edition of the show for ''[[Stand Up to Cancer UK|Stand Up to Cancer]]''. Channel 4 announced the return of the show a month later, to be hosted by [[Richard Ayoade]] and featuring a revamped format.

During a visit to Paris, the producers were taken to a warehouse in which stood a full-size Crystal Dome created by the French. Antoine showed the British producers a rough sketch of a set design with the dome in the middle of four other sets. This was used as inspiration for the concept of ''The Crystal Maze'' which was developed in just \"two days\", creating a show which although similar to ''Fort Boyard'', was substantially different in presentation and style. According to Richard O'Brien, who was selected to be the host for this project, the original outlined concept was \"kind of like \"[[Dungeons and Dragons]]\", with the host acting as the \"[[Dungeon master]]\".<ref name=\"fortboyardpilot\">{{cite web|url=http://www.robcrusade.com/articles/adhoc.html |title=Interview from adhoc.com |publisher=The Richard O'Brien Crusade |date= |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n\nIt was later adapted in France for children under the title of ''[[:fr:Les Mondes fantastiques#Histoire|Les Mondes fantastiques]]'' (''Fantastic worlds'') and broadcast from 9 September 1992 to 15 November 1995 on [[France 3]].\n\n==Format==\n{{for|the games used in \"The Crystal Maze\"|List of The Crystal Maze games}}\nEach team that compete on ''The Crystal Maze'' undertake a series of challenges (referred to as games). Teams begin at a pre-determined zone, whereupon they compete in a finite number of games in each zone, accruing as many time crystals as they can before travelling to the large \"Crystal Dome\" at the centre of the maze to meet their final challenge. Upon entering a game's cell, the objective is usually determined by either a clear written message or cryptic clue. The remainder of the team watch their progress either through a cell's windows or monitors depending on the zone aesthetic, and may give advice to the contestant unless stipulated otherwise. The host will serve reminders of the time limit and of any special rules, and generally will not give hints unless the contestant is struggling badly.\n\nEach game falls under one of four categories:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of ''The Crystal Maze'' Categories\n|-\n! Category\n! Description\n|-\n| {{nowrap|Mental}}\n| Mental and memory skill ranging from simple brainteasers, to acute memory and 2D/3D puzzles.\n|-\n| {{nowrap|Mystery}}\n|  Testing a contestant's problem solving abilities ranging from [[Scavenger Hunts|treasure hunts]] to large-scale mazes.\n|-\n| {{nowrap|Physical}}\n| Testing a contestant's physical abilities ranging from obstacle courses, to lifting, using, cranking, or manipulating objects.\n|-\n| {{nowrap|Skill}}\n| Testing a contestant's [[dexterity]], [[accuracy]] and eye\u2013hand coordination ranging from target-shooting, timing tests, to vehicle driving.\n|-\n|}\n\nEach game presents the potential of being locked within a game's cell. If locked in, the contestant is unable to take any further part in proceedings unless they are released by their team captain at the cost of an earned Crystal. If the team's captain is locked in, the vice-captain takes over and may select a new vice-captain to replace them and so on. Reduction in team members poses an increased difficulty for future games and at their final challenge.\n\nThere are two ways a lock-in can occur in ''The Crystal Maze'', if a contestant exceeds their time limit within the cell or if they breach a game's special rules or restrictions, irrespective of their progress in obtaining the crystal. This is outlined prior to a contestant entering the cell by the Maze Master.\n\nOnce the team arrives at the Crystal Dome, they are told how much time that they have to complete the final challenge, based on the number of crystals they have brought with them (five seconds for each crystal they had at the end of the game). At this point, the team enter the Dome, and upon the challenge beginning, they must collect as many gold foil tokens as they can and deposit them into a container along a wall of the Dome, while avoiding any silver tokens mixed in with them; these are blown about by fans beneath the floor of the Dome. Once time is up, the fans are switched off and no more tokens can be deposited into the container; a slot is opened during the challenge, which closes up when the time is up. Once the team is outside the dome, they, along with any members who were not present for the final challenge, are given the tally of their efforts by the host. If the team accumulate a total of 100 gold tokens or more, after deduction of any silver tokens, the team wins the grand prize that they chose for themselves before partaking in the show. All contestants who participate in the show win a commemorative crystal saying \"I Cracked the Crystal Maze\", which acts as a [[consolation prize]] if a team fails to secure the required number of gold tokens.<ref name=\"faq\">{{cite web|url=http://crystalmaze.marcgerrish.com/faq.htm |title=FAQ |publisher=CrystalMaze.MarcGerrish.com |date= |accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Original series ===\nDuring the run of the original series between 1990 and 1995, teams consisted of three men and three women, each aged between 16 and 40, who were put together by the production team and did not know each other before appearing on the show<ref name=\"boblishman\">{{cite web|last=Lishman|first=Bob|url=http://www.boblishman.com/CrystalMaze/|title=The Unofficial Crystal Maze Website |publisher=boblishman.com |date= |accessdate=17 Oct 2017}}</ref> From their pre-determined starting zone, teams either travelled clockwise or counter-clockwise around the maze, engaging in at least three games in each zone, sometimes being given the opportunity to play a fourth game in a zone during their trip around the maze. Between the first and fourth series, the total number of games that could be played varied between 14 and 16 per episode, but for the fifth and sixth series, the number of games played was reduced to standard of 13. Throughout the run, 3D maps of varying sophistication were used to highlight where the host and team were. Until the end of the third series, each contestant on the team could win a prize for themselves that they chose before taking on the Maze if the team succeeded at collecting 100 or more gold tokens, but from the fourth series, this format was changed to the team choosing a prize that they shared together if they won the final challenge. During the first series, a runner-up prize could also be chosen by each member of a team, which they won if the final tally of tokens was between 50 and 99, but this format was dropped by the start of the second series.  \n\nDuring the Christmas specials, the teams consisted of similar setup, with each aged between 8 and 16,{{Citation needed|reason=Need someone to double check this age range is correct|date=July 2017}} and selected by the production team. While the format was similar to the adult version, there were notable differences, such as easier games with fewer chances of a lock-in, more lenient time limits and additional clues from the host. The prize would always be awarded at the end, irrespective of achievement.\n\n=== Revived series ===\nFollowing the one-off ''Stand Up to Cancer'' edition, Channel 4 revived the show featuring the original setup of zones, the same map design from the ''SU2C'' special, and a newly designed taller set. The format of the show was revamped to have five contestants who have a prior connection (family, colleagues, etc.) and a reduction in games to ten.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belfastlive.co.uk/news/tv/how-apply-new-series-crystal-12475591|title=Crystal Maze is coming back... and they're looking for contestants|first=Sheena|last=McStravick|date=19 January 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn a similar vein to the 2016 ''SU2C'' special, a series of celebrity episodes was initially broadcast. The contestants taking part were given an extra crystal upon reaching the Dome (or by completing an additional task during the show) to add to those that they had brought, and would earn cash for ''Stand Up to Cancer'' depending on how many gold tokens they got, after deduction of silver \u00a35,000 for less than 50 gold tokens, \u00a310,000 for 50 to 99 tokens, and \u00a320,000 for 100 or more tokens.\n\nThe 2019 series introduces the \"Mega Crystal\", a noticeably larger version of the Crystals within the Maze. The team has one opportunity to earn the Mega Crystal, and the team captain decides before each game whether they want that game to be played for the Mega Crystal. If the team earns the Mega Crystal, it grants them ten seconds of time (instead of the standard five) in the Crystal Dome.\n\n== Hosts ==\nThroughout its history, ''The Crystal Maze'' has been presented by a series of hosts known as Maze Masters. Each takes on the role of the Adam Conover responsible for guiding each team around the various zones, keeping them updated on their progress, leading each nominated team member to the respective games, acting as the timekeeper on all games and the final challenge at the Dome, and taking safe custody of each crystal won by the team.\n\nThe [[breaking the fourth wall|short monologue to camera]] scenes originated when O'Brien began joking with the cameramen during filming of an episode. When the production team reviewed the footage and realized what it could bring to the show they \"asked him to do it all the time\", to which O'Brien felt that looking straight at the camera, \"unknowingly added a complicity between me and the audience at home\".<ref name=\"inside story\"/> However, he also \"often appeared detached from proceedings, bordering on deadpan\",<ref name=\"pinknews\">{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/11/02/interview-the-rocky-horror-shows-richard-obrien/|date=2 November 2011|title=Interview: The Rocky Horror Show's Richard O'Brien|publisher=PinkNews|accessdate=25 April 2013}}</ref> Each successive host has continued these monologues, adding their own variant to the show.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+List of ''The Crystal Maze'' Hosts\n|-\n!

He was always broadly welcoming and encouraging to teams, being congratulatory on their successes, but would show visible frustration with a contestant for a particularly sub-standard attempt at a game, and would encourage them to use their allotted time effectively. During a game, O'Brien would produce a harmonica from his pocket during a game, and played one short and repetitive tune which he called \"excitement music\". On a number of occasions, he would 'find' other musical instruments in the maze, which were used to showcase his talents, even occasionally breaking into song. O'Brien would often comment that he built the games and would adapt them for future teams if a game was beaten quickly. At the start of the series five Christmas special, O'Brien departed the series to start a new life in [[California]] with Mumsie.\n|-\n| [[Ed Tudor-Pole]]\n| 1993\u20131995\n| The second host, Tudor-Pole, wore an elaborate waistcoat and tunic, off-white sleeves and trousers, and long black boots, in a similar style to his predecessor, with his look having been described as \"Georgian\". While his style of hosting had the similar energetic style to O'Brien's, it was less detached, with Tudor-Pole being more sympathetic towards contestants, and often talking up the '[[time travel]]' elements of the show, with the inclusion of nonsense words, such as \"trignification\" to describe the process of travelling between time zones, providing fictitious backstories of each zone while often referring to unseen companions in the maze, such as his horse \"Bert\" in Medieval Zone, and \"Starbuck\", a deranged cat, who lives in Ocean Zone. According to [[h2g2]], \"pale and looking a little emaciated, Ed Tudor-Pole gave The Crystal Maze a dark and intimidating feeling\".<ref name=\"h2g2\"/>\n|-\n| {{nowrap|[[Stephen Merchant]]}}\n| 2016\n| The third host, appearing in a one-off edition for ''[[Stand Up to Cancer UK|Stand Up to Cancer]]'' in 2016.

Ayoade will frequently refer to contestants by their initials, colour jumpsuit (e.g. yellow [[Katie Price|Katie]]) or coin a nickname based on their performance in the Maze.\n|-\n|[[Adam Conover]]{{efn|name=Crystal Maze US|Adam Conover hosts the American version on ''[[Nickelodeon]]''.}}\n| {{nowrap|2020\u2013present}}\n| The first host of the American version, Conover is dressed in a tailor-made suit with a [[brooch]] on his left lapel. In the show, Conover describes his role as an \"ageless trickster spirit\" who actively encourages teams, and is inquisitive about their lives before entering the Maze. Throughout the show, Conover tells the audience and teams a combination of real and fictitious tales of events that happened in each zone similar to his role on ''[[Adam Ruins Everything]]''.\n|}\n\n=== Other characters ===\nWhilst the Maze is home to the Maze Master, several original characters have appeared whether as part of a particular game such as a jailor, guard and tribal priest, or are otherwise fictionalized within a respective zone. Notable characters include:\n\n* '''Mumsie and Auntie Sabrina''' Portrayed by Sandra Caron, Mumsie is a genial fortune teller during O'Brien's tenure, hosting a recurring mental game in the Medieval Zone that involved [[brain teaser]] questions; Caron portrayed Mumsie for the first, second and fourth series of the original run, and Auntie Sabrina for the third series, who was described by O'Brien as taking over while his Mumsie was away. Both characters were portrayed as friendly to the contestants, with Mumsie sometimes being overly motherly with O'Brien, and often talked about her affair she was having with a man called \"Ralph\" to both the contestants and audience during the first and second series, showing disapproval of her next affair with man called \"Dwayne\" during the fourth series. Mumsie departed with O'Brien at the start of the fifth series. In [[The_Crystal_Maze#The_Crystal_Maze_Live_Experience|The Crystal Maze Live Experience]], Mumsie is an [[unseen character]] which the Maze Master communicates with through an earpiece.\n* '''The Computer''' An operating system for the Futuristic Zone is situated within; if the team's starting point is this zone, the computer provides a question for the team that they must answer correctly to gain entry into the Maze. During O'Brien's tenure (with the exception of series 2), the computer had a male voice and usually acted antagonistically towards him. During Tudor-Pole's tenure, the computer adopted a female voice and was named Barbara. In Ayoade's tenure, the computer retains a female voice but no other personality traits are shown, only speaking when a team seeks entry to the maze.\n* '''The Riddle Master''' Portrayed by [[Adam Buxton]], the Riddle Master, credited as Jarhead, is a head that resides in a glass jar who creates Crystals by mixing potions using [[telekinesis]] when a contestant completes his game. Though primarily in the Futuristic zone, he has appeared in other zones where his jar changes aesthetic. He has a friendly, though seemingly subservient, relationship to Ayoade.\n* '''Knight Marion'''{{efn|name=TheKnight|In the episode \u201cThe Ali Family\u201d, the Knight introduces herself as Marion in the Medieval zone.}} Portrayed by [[Jessica Hynes]], Marion is a King's Knight and guard of the Medieval Zone who wears oversized battle armour, carries a large sword, and grants entry. She was known to ask Ayoade to attend events with her, which he rebuffed. When Medieval was replaced with Eastern, she did not return.\n\n==Filming==\nEach episode had a budget of \u00a3125,000 and was filmed over a period of two days at the show's studio. During the first day of shooting, the team, followed by multiple cameras, tackle all the games and discover their fate in the crystal dome in the style of a \"live\" shoot. The following day then focuses on acquiring close-up shots of gameplay with a single camera, requiring team members to return to games they had already won or lost, along with redoing the last challenge in the dome to get footage of them grabbing for tokens. An entire series requires about five weeks to be filmed, with three episodes produced per week.<ref name=\"inside story\">Patrick Smith, [https://www.buzzfeed.com/patricksmith/to-the-crystal-dome The Inside Story Of \"The Crystal Maze\", The Most Epic Game Show Ever Made], ''[[BuzzFeed]]'', 18 May 2015</ref> Each series of the show featured its own portfolio of games: 37 different game designs in series 1, and between 41 and 49 games in each subsequent series.<ref name=\"BBCinsideCrystalMaze\">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-40354288 |title=The Crystal Maze: Inside the new zones |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=19 July 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"seriesindex\">{{cite web|url=http://crystalmaze.marcgerrish.com/series/index.htm |title=Series |publisher=CrystalMaze.MarcGerrish.com |date= |accessdate=12 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n===The set===\nEvery episode, with the exception of the 2016 special, is filmed on a very large custom built set. The set, designed by James Dillon for both the original run and the revived series, is divided into five parts, four of which are named as zones, set in different periods of time and space, which house the games that contestants take on, while the final part, called the Crystal Dome, houses the final challenge that the team tackle together towards the end of the episode.<ref name=\"BBCinsideCrystalMaze\"/><ref name=\"RadioTimesHITSD\">{{cite magazine|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2017-07-07/the-crystal-maze-how-is-the-new-series-different-to-the-original |title=The Crystal Maze: How is the new series different to the original? |magazine=The Radio Times |accessdate=15 July 2017}}</ref> The theme of each zone is not only reflected via its time period, but also in the time-keeping devices, the design of the games, and how the host and team entered and moves between the zones.

Exiting in the original series was either a tunnel leading off towards Industrial/Ocean, and a set of steps to a ledge heading towards Futuristic though in the revived series the latter is implemented for all zone transitions.

The zone was used for three series in the original run, with teams able to watch their nominated member's efforts in a game via one of a number of monitors used in the zone. Industrial was brought back for the revived series, maintaining the same design style as the original, though with teams able to watch proceedings in a game via either monitors or panels that opened into a cell. Entry into this zone was initially designed towards finding a key to unlock a chain-mesh gate, but later changed towards finding a way over it and around a number of small obstacles, with stairs leading to an upper floor passage towards Medieval, and a pipeline tunnel towards Aztec. In the American version of the show, Industrial is green on the map.\n|[[Analogue clock]]\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"royalblue\" | \n| rowspan=3 | '''Futuristic'''\n| rowspan=2 | Series 1\u20136{{efn|name=FuturisticOriginal|In series 1 - 3 the Futuristic zone was coloured blue on the 3D map and changed to gray from series 4 - 6 when [[#Former zones|Ocean zone]] was introduced.}}\n| rowspan=2 | Designed as a [[space station]], orbiting an unknown planet in the distant [[future]]. Futuristic was designed as run down, with metal sliding doors, exposed wiring, viewpoints that looked out into space with monitors spread over the station to view inside the cells, and cell doors having a keypad next to them where the host punched a code into to allow access. Entry was designed around an airlock setup, with a computer panel the host used to boot up the station's computer and request a question for the team, with a passage leading off towards Medieval, and a lift that allowed the host and team to shift between a walkway and a ledge connecting to Aztec.\n| rowspan=3 | [[Digital clock]]\n|- \n| bgcolor=\"silver\" | \n|-\n| bgcolor=\"royalblue\" | \n| 2016\u2013present\n| For the revival, the station was clean and sleek, with a central console for contestants to view games set on [[lazy susan|rotating floor]] with three corridors that housed the games with the cell doors no longer requiring an access code. Entry and exit to the zone was via an airlock similar to the original series, with entry determined by answering a question by the computer (if Futuristic was the starting zone) and exiting was by the same method by stepping on a '[[Teleportation|teleporter pad]]' to traverse between zones.\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"red\" | \n|'''Eastern'''\n| 2019\u2013present\n|Themed around the architecture and iconography of [[East Asia]] with a lily pond, ornate vases, lanterns, and solid colors throughout.

The interior is designed with rails for the team to hold onto before the final challenge begins, with a mesh floor and a series of fans below the base which activate on the host's command, blowing foil tokens around. The exterior differs between the original run, one-off special and revived series, but always provided the host with a small hexagonal podium designed to hold the team's acquired crystals. Each crystal is illuminated from below by lights which are deactivated sequentially at intervals of five seconds, serving as a countdown. The challenge is over when all crystals are dark. In the original series the Dome featured an encircling moat with the podium having two switches with which the host controlled a moat bridge and door to the Dome. For the revived series, the moat and switches were retired and the Dome redesigned to feature a set of flashing lights (Red to cease collecting tokens, Gold for achieving the top prize, etc.) The opening scene of each episode often comprises a greeting from the host from in front of the dome with tokens flying within.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n|[[The Crystal Maze#Format|Time crystals]]\n|}\n\n=== Former zones ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! colspan=2 | Zone\n!Appearances\n!Description\n!Method of timekeeping\n|-\n| bgcolor=\"forestgreen\" | \n|'''Medieval'''\n| Series 1\u20136<br>2016\u20132018\n|This is designed as a castle of the [[Middle Ages]], laden with a straw covered [[flagstone]] floor, wooden barrels, and a large dining table with solid wooden chairs.

This zone was referred within the show as the homestead of the Maze Master. Entry into this zone was initially done by contestants raising the portcullis at the castle's entrance by finding the right chain, and then later having to climb over it. In the revived series, this method was changed to simply answering a riddle to open a portcullis. The zone was designed with a passage that led to Futuristic via a beam that had to be crossed, and a set of stairs that had to be crossed to get to Industrial/Ocean, later this was changed to a set of ledges that had to be traversed.

Entry was designed around climbing down from the bridge into the boiler room via a rope ladder, with a hatchway at the top of a ladder leading to Medieval, and a ventilation shaft leading towards Aztec.\n|Analogue clocks\n|-\n|}\n\n===Location===\nFor the first series, the show was filmed at [[Shepperton Studios]], within a stage set measuring {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} and containing a water tank on-site. After the first series, the production team decided to expand the maze, relocating the set to an adapted aircraft hangar, Hangar 6, operated by Aces High Studios at [[North Weald Airfield]] in [[Essex]]. After the show ended in 1995, when [[Channel 4]]'s contract with producers Chatsworth TV expired, the set was eventually dismantled. When the broadcaster decided to make a one-off edition of the show for ''Stand Up for Cancer'' in 2016, the episode was filmed at The Crystal Maze live immersive experience in London, as it was no longer possible to use the original set. When Channel 4 made the decision to revive the show for a full series in November 2016, James Dillon was asked to design a new set at a {{convert|30000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} warehouse at [[The Bottle Yard Studios]] in [[Bristol]].<ref name=\"somersetlive\">{{cite web |url=http://www.somersetlive.co.uk/the-new-crystal-maze-series-with-richard-ayoade-will-be-filmed-in-bristol-and-you-can-take-part/story-30066838-detail/story.html |title=New Crystal Maze series, with Richard Ayoade, will be filmed in Bristol |date= |accessdate=17 January 2017 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Dillon went back to his original plans and sketches but took the opportunity to build and expand on several of his original ideas and concepts.

In the London experience, four teams enter the maze at separate locations, and rotate around the four zones simultaneously before competing against each other in The Crystal Dome. In the Manchester experience, the zones are split in two parts, and the teams move through the maze one after the other, such that each half-zone always has one team in it. Like the London Maze, teams compete for the high score in the Crystal Dome, by collecting as many gold tokens as possible, but unlike in London, the teams never meet or compete against one another.<ref name=\"standard.co.uk\">{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/great-days-out/crystal-maze-london-start-the-fans-devotees-of-the-crystal-maze-can-try-its-challenges-for-real-a3200126.html|title=London's Crystal Maze experience is 'worth every penny'|date=10 March 2016|publisher=}}</ref> The group secured a venue for the Maze in the [[Kings Cross, London|King's Cross]] area in late 2015, and it opened for contestants on 15 March 2016.<ref name=\"standard.co.uk\"/> In November 2016 another live experience in [[Manchester]] at the [[Granada Studios]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/whats-on/whats-on-news/crystal-maze-manchester-granada-studios-12213730|title=The Crystal Maze is coming to Manchester \u2013 11 things to expect|first=Denise|last=Evans|date=22 November 2016|publisher=}}</ref> opened to the public in April 2017.\n\n===The Cyberdrome Crystal Maze===\nThe Cyberdrome Crystal Maze was an attraction usually found in bowling alleys and video arcades in the UK. It allowed entrants an opportunity to play the Crystal Maze in a computerised format. As this feature lacked a host, rules regarding lock ins were changed. The locations of the Cyberdromes were [[Blackpool]], [[Pembrokeshire]], [[Southampton]], [[Coventry]], and [[Maidenhead]] with an additional location in [[Japan]].\n\n===Quiz machines===\n[[Chatsworth Television]] licensed a number of popular [[skill with prize|SWP]] [[quiz machine|gambling machine]]s based on the TV series.

Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the term ''[[Pyrrhic victory]]'' was coined.\n\nPyrrhus became king of Epirus in 306 BC at the age of 13, but was dethroned by [[Cassander]] four years later. He saw action during the [[Wars of the Diadochi]] and regained his throne in 297 BC with the support of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. During what came to be known as the [[Pyrrhic War]], Pyrrhus fought Rome at the behest of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], scoring costly victories at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]] and [[Battle of Asculum|Asculum]]. He proceeded to take over [[Sicily]] from [[Carthage]] but was soon driven out, and lost all his gains in Italy after the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC.\n\nPyrrhus seized the Macedonian throne from [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] in 274 BC and [[Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese|invaded the Peloponnese]] in 272 BC. The Epirote [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]] was thwarted, however, and Pyrrhus was killed during a street battle at [[Argos]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn c. 319 BC, Pyrrhus was born to prince [[Aeacides of Epirus|Aeacides]] of Epirus,<ref>At Pyrrhus' birth in 319 BC, Aeacides was only a prince and his father, Arrybas, ruled Epirus as a regent to the underaged King Neoptolemus.</ref> and [[Phthia of Epirus|Phthia]], a Thessalian noblewoman, the daughter of the Thessalian general [[Menon IV of Pharsalus|Menon]]. Aeacides was a cousin of [[Olympias]], making Pyrrhus a second-cousin-once-removed to [[Alexander the Great]]. He had two sisters: [[Deidamia I of Epirus|Deidamia]] and Troias. In 319/318 BC, Arrybas, Aeacides' father and the regent of Epirus, died leaving Epirus to the joint kings Aeacides and [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]]. \n\nAeacides supported Olympias in her fight against [[Cassander]] and marched on Macedon. In 317 BC, when Pyrrhus was only two, Olympias requested Aeacides' support yet again and he marched on Macedon a second time. Many of his soldiers did not like their service and mutinied. Aeacides released these soldiers from his army, but as a result his army was too small to achieve anything. When the mutineers arrived in Epirus they caused a rebellion against their absent king and Aeacides was dethroned. Cassander sent one of his generals, Lyciscus, to act as regent to the still underaged Neoptolemus. Epirus in effect became a puppet kingdom of Cassander. Pyrrhus' family fled north and took refuge with [[King Glaukias|Glaukias]] of the [[Taulantii|Taulantians]], one of the largest [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus was raised by [[Beroea of Epirus|Beroea]], Glaukias' wife, a [[Molossian]] of the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty.<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=124}}.</ref> Cassander marched against Glaukias, defeated his army and captured [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]. Glaukias had to promise not to act against Cassander, but he refused to give up Pyrrhus and his family.<ref name=JFP12>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=12}}.</ref>\n\nBy 313 BC, Cassander was distracted by his war against [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus Monophthalmus]], one of the most powerful of the [[Diadochi]]. Fearing an invasion from [[Asia Minor]], where Antigonus was building up his forces, he shifted his attention from west to the east. Aeacides took advantage of the situation and returned to Epirus. He appears to have regained popularity and raised a large army. Cassander sent an army under his brother Philip who defeated Aeacides in two battles. Aeacides was wounded in the last battle and died soon after.<ref name=JFP12/>\n\n==First reign==\nIn 307 BC, Glaukias invaded Epirus and put Pyrrhus upon the throne. Pyrrhus was only eleven years old, his guardians would rule in his stead until he came of age.<ref>Justin, ''Epitome'', 17.3.</ref> When he was seventeen he travelled to the court of Glaukias to attend the wedding of one of Glaukias' sons, while he was in Illyria the [[Molossians]] rose in rebellion and drove out Pyrrhus' supporters and placed Neoptolemus back on the throne. This time Glaukias was unable to help him.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=14}}; Glaukias' kingdom was being attacked by pirates.</ref> \n\n==Exile==\nPyrrhus travelled to the [[Peloponnese]] and served his brother-in-law [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]] who had married his sister Deidamia, and who was campaigning against Cassander in southern Greece.\n\n===The Battle of Ipsus===\n{{main|Battle of Ipsus}}\nIn 302 BC, Demetrius took his army to Asia Minor to support his father Antigonus Monophthalmus. Pyrrhus impressed Antigonus for he is reputed to have said that Pyrrhus would become the greatest general of his time, if he lived long enough.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=15}}.</ref>\n\nAntigonus had grown too powerful and the other successors, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]], had united against him. Lysimachus and Seleucus, reinforced by two of Cassander's armies, had concentrated their forces in Asia Minor and marched on Antigonus. Both armies met at [[Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]]. The Battle of Ipsus was the largest and most important battle of the [[Wars of the Diadochi|Wars of the Successors]]. Pyrrhus probably fought with Demetrius on the right wing, a place of honour, and made a brilliant display of valour among the combatants. Unfortunately for Antigonus, he lost both the battle and his life. Demetrius, victorious on his wing, managed to escape with 9,000 men. Pyrrhus, still with Demetrius, continued to serve his brother-in-law who started rebuilding his father's empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=14\u201317}}.</ref>\n\n===Ptolemy===\nIn 298 BC, Pyrrhus was taken hostage to Alexandria, under the terms of a peace treaty made between Demetrius and [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. There, he married Ptolemy I's stepdaughter [[Antigone of Epirus|Antigone]] (a daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]]\u2014respectively, Ptolemy I's wife and a Macedonian noble). In 297 BC, Cassander died and Ptolemy, always looking for allies, decided to help restore Pyrrhus to his kingdom. He provided Pyrrhus with men and funds and sent him back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=18}}.</ref>\n\n==Second reign==\nPyrrhus returned to Epirus at the head of an army, but not willing to fight a civil war he agreed to rule Epirus together with Neoptolemus. Soon both kings started to plot against one another. Pyrrhus was informed of a plot against his life and decided to strike first. He invited his fellow king to a dinner and had him murdered. The act does not appear to be unpopular as Epirus' nobility seem to have been devoted to him.<ref>Plutarch. ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 5.</ref> \n\nIn 295 BC, Pyrrhus transferred the capital of his kingdom to [[Arta, Greece|Ambracia]]. In 292 BC, he went to war against his former ally and brother-in-law Demetrius, he invaded [[Thessaly]] while Demetrius was [[Siege of Thebes (292-291 BC)|besieging Thebes]]. Demetrius responded immediately, he left the siege to his son [[Antigonus Gonatas]] and marched back north at the head of a large army.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}; Demetrius commanded the full might of the Macedonian army which at that particular time was much larger than the army of Epirus.</ref> Pyrrhus, outnumbered, withdrew to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nWhile he was back in Epirus, Pyrrhus suffered another setback. His second wife Lannasa, daughter of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]] the self proclaimed king of [[Sicily]], deserted him. She claimed that she, a daughter of a Greek king, could no longer bear to share her home with barbarian women. She fled to [[Corcyra]], her dowry, and offered it and herself to Demetrius. He accepted, sailed to the island and took possession of both Corcyra and Lannasa. After returning to his army in mainland Greece, Demetrius planned to invade Epirus. In 289 BC, he invaded Pyrrhus' allies the [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]], hoping to neutralize them before he invaded Epirus. The Aetolians refused battle and retreated into the hills. After ransacking their countryside, Demetrius left a strong force under his best general Pantauchus in Aetolia and marched on Epirus. Meanwhile, Pyrrhus had raised his army and was marching to his allies rescue. The two armies, on different roads, passed one another and Demetrius started plundering Epirus while Pyrrhus met Pantauchus in battle.\n\nPyrrhus had the bulk of the army of Epirus with him, probably 20,000-25,000 men, while Pantauchus commanded but a detachment of Demetrius' army consisting of around 11,000 men. The fighting was heavy, and according to the sources Pantauchus and Pyrrhus sought out one another. Pantauchus challenged Pyrrhus to individual combat, Pyrrhus accepted. After hurling spears at each other they fought it out with swords. Pyrrhus was wounded, but in return wounded his opponent twice, in the thigh and in the neck. Pantauchus' bodyguards had to carry him away. Emboldened by their king's victory the Epirots resumed their attack and broke Pantauchus' army, and took 5,000 prisoners. The army then honoured Pyrrhus by bestowing the surname of 'Eagle' upon him. Demetrius, upon hearing of Pyrrhus' victory, marched back to Macedon. Pyrrhus released his prisoners and marched back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=33\u201334}}.</ref>\n \nIn 289 BC, Pyrrhus, learning that Demetrius was dangerously ill, invaded Macedonia. His original intention was merely to raid and pillage, but with Demetrius unable to lead his forces he met almost no opposition. Pyrrhus penetrated as far as the old Macedonian capital of Aegae before Demetrius was well enough to take the field. Since Demetrius commanded a superior force Pyrrhus had no choice but to retreat.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=34}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius, just as restless as Pyrrhus, planned to invade Asia and reclaim his father's old domains. He first made peace with Pyrrhus granting him his holdings in Macedonia while holding on to Corcyra and Leucas, then he started to raise a vast army and a huge fleet.<ref>Reputedly raising 110,000 soldiers and 500 ships.</ref> Faced with this threat, the other Diadochi, Lysimachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus, allied against him. The three kings sent embassies to Pyrrhus trying to win him over to their side or at least get him to remain neutral. If the allies won and Pyrrhus remained neutral he would gain nothing. If on the other hand Demetrius would be victorious he could overwhelm Pyrrhus at any time in the future. Pyrrhus personal enmity against Demetrius might have played an additional role in his decision to join the allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=34\u201335}}.</ref>\n\nIn 288 BC, the allied kings began their campaigns against Demetrius. Ptolemy sailed against Demetrius' Greek allies with a large fleet. Lysimachus invaded upper Macedonia from Thrace. Pyrrhus waited untill Demetrius had marched against Lysimachus and then invaded southern Macedonia. Demetrius must have thought Pyrrhus would not renege on his treaty for western and southern Macedonia fell without opposition. Meanwhile, Demetrius had won a victory over Lysimachus near [[Amphipolis]]. When the Macedonian army heard their homeland was being overrun by Pyrrhus they turned on Demetrius. They were fed up with his autocratic rule and grandiose plans and refused to advance any further. Demetrius then led his army against Pyrrhus, probably hoping his Macedonians would be more willing to fight a foreign invader than Lysimachus, a veteran of Alexander. Unfortunately for Demetrius, his troops were so fed up with him they deserted to Pyrrhus and he had to flee. Lysimachus was soon joined by Pyrrhus and they decided to share rulership over Macedonia.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=35\u201336}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius gathered a new army in Greece and besieged Athens, which had rebelled against the puppet government he had installed. The Athenians called on Pyrrhus for assistance and he marched against Demetrius once more. This caused Demetrius to raise the siege. The Athenians thanked Pyrrhus, they erected a bust to him and allowed him into the city for the celebrations. However, they did not allow his army to enter the city, probably fearing Pyrrhus would install a garrison and make himself overlord of Athens. Pyrrhus made the most of the situation and advised the Athenians never to let a king enter their city again.<ref name=JFP37>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=37}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus and Demetrius made peace once more but, like all previous agreements, it did not last. When Demetrius, in 286 BC, invaded Asia, to attack Lysimachus' Asian domains, Lysimachus requested Pyrrhus invade Thessaly and from there attack Demetrius' garrisons in Greece. Pyrrhus agreed, probably to keep his fractious Macedonian troops busy and less likely to rebel and also to gain an easy victory over the weakened Antigonids.<ref>Plutarch. ''Pyrrhus'', 12; Plutarch. ''Demetrius'', 41.</ref> He quickly defeated [[Antigonus Gonatas]], Demetrius' son, who ceded Thessaly to him in order to make peace. Pyrrhus' Greek Empire was now at its zenith, he ruled an enlarged Epirus, half of Macedonia and Thessaly.<ref name=JFP37/> \n\nIn 285 BC, Demetrius was defeated by Seleucus. This freed the hands of Lysimachus who decided to get rid of his co-ruler in Macedonia. He first isolated Pyrrhus from his traditional ally the Ptolemies, by marrying [[Arsinoe II|Arsinoe]], the sister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]]. He also made a large donation to the [[Aetolians]], Pyrrhus' main allies in Greece. Pyrrhus felt threatened enough to make an alliance with Antigonus Gonatas. In 284 BC, Lysimachus invaded Pyrrhus' half of Macedonia with a huge army.<ref>In 301 BC, at the Battle of Ipsus, Lysimachus had fielded 40,000 troops. Since then he had acquired half of Macedonia and western Asia Minor. With these combined assets his army could have numbered over 70,000 troops. Pyrrhus commanded 40,000 troops at best.</ref> Unable to stand against Lysimachus' superior army Pyrrhus retreated and linked up with Antigonus Gonatas. Lysimachus started a propaganda campaign in which he appealed to the patriotism of the Macedonians serving Pyrrhus. He reminded them that Pyrrhus was in fact a foreign king while he himself was a true Macedonian. The campaign was successful. With his Macedonian troops turning against him Pyrrhus had no other choice but to withdraw to Epirus. Lysimachus invaded an plundered Epirus the following year. Pyrrhus did not oppose Lysimachus for he was probably fighting a war in Illyria to the north. According to Pausanius, \"Pyrrhus was roaming around as usual\".<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=37\u201339}}; {{harvnb|Greenwalt|2010|p=298: \"From 288 until 284, Pyrrhus and Lysimachus shared the rule of Macedonia until the latter drove the former back to Epirus (Plut., ''Pyrrhus'' 7\u201312).\"}}; Pausanius.

Although this was designed as a measure against the Italian peoples of [[Lucanians|Lucania]], the Tarentines grew nervous and attacked the Romans in Thurii, driving the Roman garrison from the city and sinking several Roman warships. Tarentum was now faced with a Roman attack and certain defeat, unless they could enlist the aid of greater powers. Rome had already made itself into a major power, and was poised to subdue all the Greek cities in [[Magna Graecia]]. The Tarentines asked Pyrrhus to lead their war against the Romans.<ref name=BritA/><ref name=encarta2008>{{cite encyclopedia|title=Pyrrhus|encyclopedia=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|year=2008}}</ref> Pyrrhus was encouraged to aid the Tarentines by the [[Oracle of Delphi]]. He recognized the possibility of carving out an empire for himself in [[Italy]]. He made an alliance with [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], King of [[Macedon]] and his most powerful neighbor, and arrived in Italy in 280 BC.\n\nPyrrhus entered Italy with an army consisting of 20,000 [[infantry]], 3,000 [[cavalry]], 2,000 [[archery|archers]], 500 [[sling (weapon)|slingers]], and 20 [[war elephant]]s in a bid to subdue the Romans.<ref name=BritA/> The elephants had been loaned to him by [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus]], who had also promised 9,000 soldiers and a further 50 elephants to defend Epirus while Pyrrhus and his army were away.\n\nDue to his superior cavalry, his elephants and his deadly [[macedonian phalanx|phalanx infantry]], he defeated the Romans, led by [[Consul]] [[Publius Valerius Laevinus]], in the [[Battle of Heraclea]] in 280 BC,<ref>[http://www.mocavo.com/History-of-Liberty-the-Ancient-Romans-Volume-2/105987/37 \"History of Liberty: The Ancient Romans\" (1853), p. 6.]</ref> in the Roman province of [[Lucania]]. There are conflicting sources about casualties. [[Hieronymus of Cardia]] reports the Romans lost about 7,000 while Pyrrhus lost 3,000 soldiers, including many of his best; Dionysius gives a bloodier view of 15,000 Roman dead and 13,000 Epirot.<ref name=\"Plutarch17.4\">Plutarch.

He then offered the Romans a peace treaty which was eventually rejected. Pyrrhus tried to wrest [[Campania]] from the Romans, but was twarted in this by the reinforced army of Laevinus. He then boldly marched on Rome itself, but found its defences too formidable. Meanwhile, the Romans had made peace with the Etruscans and had recalled [[Tiberius Coruncanius]], the other consul, who was marching his army southwards from [[Etruria]] towards Rome. Pyrrhus now faced three armies; the garrison of Rome, Laevinus from the south and Curuncanius from the north. Not wanting to be caught between three armies Pyrrhus withdrew to Tarentum, where he wintered his troops.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=75\u201376}}.</ref>\n\nWhen Pyrrhus invaded [[Apulia]] (279 BC), the two armies met in the [[Battle of Asculum]], where Pyrrhus won a costly victory.<ref name=encarta2008/> The consul [[Publius Decius Mus (279 BC)|Publius Decius Mus]] was the Roman commander, and while his able force was ultimately defeated, they almost managed to break the back of Pyrrhus' Epirot army, which guaranteed the security of the city itself. In the end, the Romans lost 6,000 men and Pyrrhus 3,500 including many officers.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus later famously commented on his victory at Asculum, stating, \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\">Plutarch. ''Parallel Lives: Pyrrhus'', [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Lives/Pyrrhus*.html#21 21.9].</ref> It is from reports of this semi-legendary event that the term [[Pyrrhic victory]] originates.\n\n==Ruler of Sicily==\nIn 278 BC, Pyrrhus received two offers simultaneously. The Greek cities in [[Sicily]] asked him to come and drive out [[Carthage]], which along with Rome was one of the two great powers of the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. At the same time, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], whose King [[Ptolemy Keraunos]] had been killed by invading [[Gauls]], asked Pyrrhus to ascend the throne of Macedon. Pyrrhus decided that Sicily offered him a greater opportunity, and transferred his army there.<ref name=BritA/>\n\nSoon after landing in Sicily, he lifted the Carthaginian [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in the same year. Pyrrhus was proclaimed king of Sicily. He was already making plans for his son Helenus to inherit the kingdom of Sicily and his other son Alexander to be given Italy. In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], the strongest Carthaginian fortress in Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus.\n\nIn 276 BC, Pyrrhus negotiated with the Carthaginians. Although they were inclined to come to terms with Pyrrhus, supply him money and send him ships once friendly relations were established, he demanded that Carthage abandon all of Sicily and make the Libyan Sea a boundary between themselves and the Greeks. The Greek cities of Sicily opposed making peace with Carthage because the Carthaginians still controlled the powerful fortress of [[Lilybaeum]], on the western end of the island. Pyrrhus eventually gave in to their proposals and broke off the peace negotiations. Pyrrhus' army then began [[Siege of Lilybaeum|besieging Lilybaeum]]. For two months he launched unsuccessful assaults on the city, until finally he realized he could not mount an effective siege without blockading it from the sea as well. Pyrrhus then requested manpower and money from the Sicilians in order to construct a powerful fleet. When the Sicilians became unhappy about these contributions he had to resort to compulsory contributions and force to keep them in line. These measures culminated in him proclaiming a military dictatorship of Sicily and installing military garrisons in Sicilian cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=97\u2013108}}.</ref>\n\nThese actions were deeply unpopular and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Pyrrhus had so alienated the Sicilian Greeks that they were willing to make common cause with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians took heart from this and sent another army against him. This army was promptly defeated. In spite of this victory, Sicily continued to grow increasingly hostile to Pyrrhus, who began to consider abandoning Sicily. At this point, Samnite and Tarentine envoys reached Pyrrhus and informed him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum had not been conquered by Rome. Pyrrhus made his decision and departed from Sicily. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=109\u2013112}}.</ref><ref>Plutarch.

When Pyrrhus returned from Sicily, he found himself vastly outnumbered against a superior Roman army under [[Manius Curius Dentatus]]. After the inconclusive [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC, Pyrrhus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus which resulted in the loss of essentially all the gains he had made in Italy.

Pyrrhus raised an army from his Epirote garrisons, Gallic mercenaries and the troops he had brought back from Italy and marched east into Macedon. He won an easy victory at the [[Battle of the Aous (274 BC)|Battle of the Aous]] and took most of Macedon.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=125\u2013128}}; Plutarch.

Furthermore Pyrrhus made himself very unpopular in Macedon by allowing his Gauls to plunder the tombs of the Macedonian kings at Aegae.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=128}}.</ref> \n\nIn 272 BC, [[Cleonymus of Sparta|Cleonymus]], a [[Sparta]]n of royal blood who was hated among fellow Spartans, asked Pyrrhus to attack Sparta and place him in power. Pyrrhus agreed to the plan, intending to win control of the [[Peloponnese]] for himself, but unexpected strong resistance thwarted his [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]]. On the retreat he lost his firstborn son [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]], who had been in command of the rearguard.\n\nPyrrhus had little time to mourn, as he was immediately offered an opportunity to intervene in a civic dispute in [[Pyrrhus'_invasion_of_the_Peloponnese#Battle_of_Argos|Argos]]. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, he hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, only to find the place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused [[Battle of Argos]] in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped.  While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier's old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him.  Whether he was alive or not after the blow is unknown, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened by the look on the face of the unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body. This story is later recounted by Plutarch in his ''Life of Pyrrhus.'' \n\nAntigonus had him cremated with all honours and sent his surviving son Helenus back to Epirus. That same year, upon hearing the news of Pyrrhus's death, the Tarentinians surrendered to Rome.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20140415 ioannina524.JPG|upright=0.5|thumb|A statue of Pyrrhus in [[Ioannina]], [[Greece]].]]\n\nIn his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [[Plutarch]] records that [[Hannibal]] ranked him as the greatest commander the world had ever seen,<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/> though in the ''Life of Titus Quinctius Flamininus'', Plutarch writes that Hannibal placed him second after [[Alexander the Great]]. This latter account is also given by [[Appian]].<ref name=\"Appian\">Appian. ''History of the Syrian Wars'', [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_02.html \u00a710] and [https://www.livius.org/ap-ark/appian/appian_syriaca_03.html \u00a711].</ref> While he was a mercurial and often restless leader, and not always a wise king, he was considered one of the greatest military commanders of his time. \n\nPyrrhus was known for his benevolence. As a general, Pyrrhus's greatest political weaknesses were his failures to maintain focus and to maintain a strong treasury at home (many of his soldiers were costly mercenaries). \n\nHis name is famous for the term \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" which refers to an exchange at the Battle of Asculum. In response to congratulations for winning a costly victory over the Romans, he is reported to have said: \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\" />\n\nPyrrhus and his campaign in Italy was effectively the only chance for Greece to check the advance of Rome towards domination of the Mediterranean world. Rather than banding together, the various Hellenistic powers continued to quarrel among themselves, sapping the financial and military strength of Greece and to a lesser extent, Macedon and the greater Hellenistic world. By 197 BC, Macedonia and many southern Greek city-states became Roman client states; in 188 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire]] was forced to cede most of [[Asia Minor]] to Rome's ally [[Pergamon]] (Pergamum). Rome inherited that state, and most of Asia Minor in 133 BC. Total Roman domination over Greece proper was marked by the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|destruction of Corinth]] in 146 BC; Greece then formed an integral part of the Roman world leading into the [[Byzantine]] period.\n\nPyrrhus wrote memoirs and several books on the art of war. These have since been lost, although, according to Plutarch, Hannibal was influenced by them,<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/> and they received praise from [[Cicero]].<ref>{{harvnb|Tinsley|2006|p=211}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus was married five times: his first wife Antigone bore him a daughter called [[Olympias II of Epirus|Olympias]] and a son named [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]] in honour of her [[Ptolemy I Soter|stepfather]]. She died in 295 BC, possibly in childbirth, since that was the same year her son was born.<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\">{{harvnb|Bennett|2010}}.</ref> His second wife was [[Lanassa (wife of Pyrrhus)|Lanassa]], daughter of King [[Agathocles of Syracuse]] (r. 317\u2013289 BC), whom he married in about 295 BC; the couple had two sons, [[Alexander II of Epirus|Alexander]]<ref name=\"harvnb|Bennett|2010\"/> and Helenus; Lanassa left Pyrrhus. His third wife was the daughter of [[Audoleon]], King of [[Paeonia (kingdom)|Paeonia]]; his fourth wife was the Illyrian princess [[Bircenna]], who was the daughter of King [[Bardylis II]] (r. c. 295\u2013290 BC); and his fifth wife was the daughter of [[Ptolemy Keraunos]], whom he married in 281/280 BC.

He was one of the strongest opponents of early [[Roman Republic|Rome]]. Several of his victorious battles caused him unacceptably heavy losses, from which the term ''[[Pyrrhic victory]]'' was coined.\n\nPyrrhus became king of Epirus in 306 BC at the age of 13, but was dethroned by [[Cassander]] four years later. He saw action during the [[Wars of the Diadochi]] and regained his throne in 297 BC with the support of [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. During what came to be known as the [[Pyrrhic War]], Pyrrhus fought Rome at the behest of [[Taranto|Tarentum]], scoring costly victories at [[Battle of Heraclea|Heraclea]] and [[Battle of Asculum|Asculum]]. He proceeded to take over [[Sicily]] from [[Carthage]] but was soon driven out, and lost all his gains in Italy after the [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC.\n\nPyrrhus seized the Macedonian throne from [[Antigonus II Gonatas]] in 274 BC and [[Pyrrhus' invasion of the Peloponnese|invaded the Peloponnese]] in 272 BC. The Epirote [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]] was thwarted, however, and Pyrrhus was killed during a street battle at [[Argos]].\n\n==Early life==\nIn c. 319 BC, Pyrrhus was born to prince [[Aeacides of Epirus|Aeacides]] of Epirus,<ref>At Pyrrhus' birth in 319 BC, Aeacides was only a prince and his father, Arrybas, ruled Epirus as a regent to the underaged King Neoptolemus.</ref> and [[Phthia of Epirus|Phthia]], a Thessalian noblewoman, the daughter of the Thessalian general [[Menon IV of Pharsalus|Menon]]. Aeacides was a cousin of [[Olympias]], making Pyrrhus a second-cousin-once-removed to [[Alexander the Great]]. He had two sisters: [[Deidamia I of Epirus|Deidamia]] and Troias. In 319/318 BC, Arrybas, Aeacides' father and the regent of Epirus, died leaving Epirus to the joint kings Aeacides and [[Neoptolemus II of Epirus|Neoptolemus]]. \n\nAeacides supported Olympias in her fight against [[Cassander]] and marched on Macedon. In 317 BC, when Pyrrhus was only two, Olympias requested Aeacides' support yet again and he marched on Macedon a second time. Many of his soldiers did not like their service and mutinied. Aeacides released these soldiers from his army, but as a result his army was too small to achieve anything. When the mutineers arrived in Epirus they caused a rebellion against their absent king and Aeacides was dethroned. Cassander sent one of his generals, Lyciscus, to act as regent to the still underaged Neoptolemus. Epirus in effect became a puppet kingdom of Cassander. Pyrrhus' family fled north and took refuge with [[King Glaukias|Glaukias]] of the [[Taulantii|Taulantians]], one of the largest [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribes.<ref name=BritA/> Pyrrhus was raised by [[Beroea of Epirus|Beroea]], Glaukias' wife, a [[Molossian]] of the [[Aeacidae]] dynasty.<ref name=\"Plutarch\"/><ref>{{harvnb|Wilkes|1992|p=124}}.</ref> Cassander marched against Glaukias, defeated his army and captured [[Apollonia (Illyria)|Apollonia]]. Glaukias had to promise not to act against Cassander, but he refused to give up Pyrrhus and his family.<ref name=JFP12>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=12}}.</ref>\n\nBy 313 BC, Cassander was distracted by his war against [[Antigonus I Monophthalmus|Antigonus Monophthalmus]], one of the most powerful of the [[Diadochi]]. Fearing an invasion from [[Asia Minor]], where Antigonus was building up his forces, he shifted his attention from west to the east. Aeacides took advantage of the situation and returned to Epirus. He appears to have regained popularity and raised a large army. Cassander sent an army under his brother Philip who defeated Aeacides in two battles. Aeacides was wounded in the last battle and died soon after.<ref name=JFP12/>\n\n==First reign==\nIn 307 BC, Glaukias invaded Epirus and put Pyrrhus upon the throne. Pyrrhus was only eleven years old, his guardians would rule in his stead until he came of age.<ref>Justin, ''Epitome'', 17.3.</ref> When he was seventeen he travelled to the court of Glaukias to attend the wedding of one of Glaukias' sons, while he was in Illyria the [[Molossians]] rose in rebellion and drove out Pyrrhus' supporters and placed Neoptolemus back on the throne. This time Glaukias was unable to help him.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=14}}; Glaukias' kingdom was being attacked by pirates.</ref> \n\n==Exile==\nPyrrhus travelled to the [[Peloponnese]] and served his brother-in-law [[Demetrius I of Macedon|Demetrius Poliorcetes]] who had married his sister Deidamia, and who was campaigning against Cassander in southern Greece.\n\n===The Battle of Ipsus===\n{{main|Battle of Ipsus}}\nIn 302 BC, Demetrius took his army to Asia Minor to support his father Antigonus Monophthalmus. Pyrrhus impressed Antigonus for he is reputed to have said that Pyrrhus would become the greatest general of his time, if he lived long enough.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=15}}.</ref>\n\nAntigonus had grown too powerful and the other successors, [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], [[Lysimachus]], [[Ptolemy I Soter|Ptolemy]] and [[Cassander]], had united against him. Lysimachus and Seleucus, reinforced by two of Cassander's armies, had concentrated their forces in Asia Minor and marched on Antigonus. Both armies met at [[Ipsus]] in [[Phrygia]]. The Battle of Ipsus was the largest and most important battle of the [[Wars of the Diadochi|Wars of the Successors]]. Pyrrhus probably fought with Demetrius on the right wing, a place of honour, and made a brilliant display of valour among the combatants. Unfortunately for Antigonus, he lost both the battle and his life. Demetrius, victorious on his wing, managed to escape with 9,000 men. Pyrrhus, still with Demetrius, continued to serve his brother-in-law who started rebuilding his father's empire.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=14\u201317}}.</ref>\n\n===Ptolemy===\nIn 298 BC, Pyrrhus was taken hostage to Alexandria, under the terms of a peace treaty made between Demetrius and [[Ptolemy I Soter]]. There, he married Ptolemy I's stepdaughter [[Antigone of Epirus|Antigone]] (a daughter of [[Berenice I of Egypt]] from her first husband [[Philip (first husband of Berenice I of Egypt)|Philip]]\u2014respectively, Ptolemy I's wife and a Macedonian noble). In 297 BC, Cassander died and Ptolemy, always looking for allies, decided to help restore Pyrrhus to his kingdom. He provided Pyrrhus with men and funds and sent him back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=18}}.</ref>\n\n==Second reign==\nPyrrhus returned to Epirus at the head of an army, but not willing to fight a civil war he agreed to rule Epirus together with Neoptolemus. Soon both kings started to plot against one another. Pyrrhus was informed of a plot against his life and decided to strike first. He invited his fellow king to a dinner and had him murdered. The act does not appear to be unpopular as Epirus' nobility seem to have been devoted to him.<ref>Plutarch. ''Life of Pyrrhus'', 5.</ref> \n\nIn 295 BC, Pyrrhus transferred the capital of his kingdom to [[Arta, Greece|Ambracia]]. In 292 BC, he went to war against his former ally and brother-in-law Demetrius, he invaded [[Thessaly]] while Demetrius was [[Siege of Thebes (292-291 BC)|besieging Thebes]]. Demetrius responded immediately, he left the siege to his son [[Antigonus Gonatas]] and marched back north at the head of a large army.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}; Demetrius commanded the full might of the Macedonian army which at that particular time was much larger than the army of Epirus.</ref> Pyrrhus, outnumbered, withdrew to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=32}}.</ref>\n\nWhile he was back in Epirus, Pyrrhus suffered another setback. His second wife Lannasa, daughter of [[Agathocles of Syracuse|Agathocles]] the self proclaimed king of [[Sicily]], deserted him. She claimed that she, a daughter of a Greek king, could no longer bare to share her home with barbarian women. She fled to [[Corcyra]], her dowry, and offered it and herself to Demetrius. He accepted, sailed to the island and took possession of both Corcyra and Lannasa. After returning to his army in mainland Greece, Demetrius planned to invade Epirus. In 289 BC, he invaded Pyrrhus' allies the [[Aetolian League|Aetolians]], hoping to neutralize them before he invaded Epirus. The Aetolians refused battle and retreated into the hills. After ransacking their countryside, Demetrius left a strong force under his best general Pantauchus in Aetolia and marched on Epirus. Meanwhile, Pyrrhus had raised his army and was marching to his allies rescue. The two armies, on different roads, passed one another and Demetrius started plundering Epirus while Pyrrhus met Pantauchus in battle.\n\nPyrrhus had the bulk of the army of Epirus with him, probably 20,000-25,000 men, while Pantauchus commanded but a detachment of Demetrius' army consisting of around 11,000 men. The fighting was heavy, and according to the sources Pantauchus and Pyrrhus sought out one another. Pantauchus challenged Pyrrhus to individual combat, Pyrrhus accepted. After hurling spears at each other they fought it out with swords. Pyrrhus was wounded, but in return wounded his opponent twice, in the thigh and in the neck. Pantauchus' bodyguards had to carry him away. Emboldened by their king's victory the Epirots resumed their attack and broke Pantauchus' army, and took 5,000 prisoners. The army then honoured Pyrrhus by bestowing the surname of 'Eagle' upon him. Demetrius, upon hearing of Pyrrhus' victory, marched back to Macedon. Pyrrhus released his prisoners and marched back to Epirus.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=33\u201334}}.</ref>\n \nIn 289 BC, Pyrrhus, learning that Demetrius was dangerously ill, invaded Macedonia. His original intention was merely to raid and pillage, but with Demetrius unable to lead his forces he met almost no opposition. Pyrrhus penetrated as far as the old Macedonian capital of Aegae before Demetrius was well enough to take the field. Since Demetrius commanded a superior force Pyrrhus had no choice but to retreat.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=34}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius, just as restless as Pyrrhus, planned to invade Asia and reclaim his father's old domains. He first made peace with Pyrrhus granting him his holdings in Macedonia while holding on to Corcyra and Leucas, then he started to raise a vast army and a huge fleet.<ref>Reputedly raising 110,000 soldiers and 500 ships.</ref> Faced with this threat, the other Diadochi, Lysimachus, Ptolemy and Seleucus, allied against him. The three kings sent embassies to Pyrrhus trying to win him over to their side or at least get him to remain neutral. If the allies won and Pyrrhus remained neutral he would gain nothing. If on the other hand Demetrius would be victorious he could overwhelm Pyrrhus at any time in the future. Pyrrhus personal enmity against Demetrius might have played an additional role in his decision to join the allies.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=34\u201335}}.</ref>\n\nIn 288 BC, the allied kings began their campaigns against Demetrius. Ptolemy sailed against Demetrius' Greek allies with a large fleet. Lysimachus invaded upper Macedonia from Thrace. Pyrrhus waited untill Demetrius had marched against Lysimachus and then invaded southern Macedonia. Demetrius must have thought Pyrrhus would not renege on his treaty for western and southern Macedonia fell without opposition. Meanwhile, Demetrius had won a victory over Lysimachus near [[Amphipolis]]. When the Macedonian army heard their homeland was being overrun by Pyrrhus they turned on Demetrius. They were fed up with his autocratic rule and grandiose plans and refused to advance any further. Demetrius then led his army against Pyrrhus, probably hoping his Macedonians would be more willing to fight a foreign invader than Lysimachus, a veteran of Alexander. Unfortunately for Demetrius, his troops were so fed up with him they deserted to Pyrrhus and he had to flee. Lysimachus was soon joined by Pyrrhus and they decided to share rulership over Macedonia.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=35\u201336}}.</ref>\n\nDemetrius gathered a new army in Greece and besieged Athens, which had rebelled against the puppet government he had installed. The Athenians called on Pyrrhus for assistance and he marched against Demetrius once more. This caused Demetrius to raise the siege. The Athenians thanked Pyrrhus, they erected a bust to him and allowed him into the city for the celebrations. However, they did not allow his army to enter the city, probably fearing Pyrrhus would install a garrison and make himself overlord of Athens. Pyrrhus made the most of the situation and advised the Athenians never to let a king enter their city again.<ref name=JFP37>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=37}}.</ref>\n\nPyrrhus and Demetrius made peace once more but, like all previous agreements, it did not last. When Demetrius, in 286 BC, invaded Asia, to attack Lysimachus' Asian domains, Lysimachus requested Pyrrhus invade Thessaly and from there attack Demetrius' garrisons in Greece. Pyrrhus agreed, probably to keep his fractious Macedonian troops busy and less likely to rebel and also to gain an easy victory over the weakened Antigonids.<ref>Plutarch. ''Pyrrhus'', 12; Plutarch. ''Demetrius'', 41.</ref> He quickly defeated [[Antigonus Gonatas]], Demetrius' son, who ceded Thessaly to him in order to make peace. Pyrrhus' Greek Empire was now at its zenith, he ruled an enlarged Epirus, half of Macedonia and Thessaly.<ref name=JFP37/> \n\nIn 285 BC, Demetrius was defeated by Seleucus. This freed the hands of Lysimachus who decided to get rid of his co-ruler in Macedonia. He first isolated Pyrrhus from his traditional ally the Ptolemies, by marrying [[Arsinoe II|Arsinoe]], the sister of [[Ptolemy II Philadelphus|Ptolemy II]]. He also made a large donation to the [[Aetolians]], Pyrrhus' main allies in Greece. Pyrrhus felt threatened enough to make an alliance with Antigonus Gonatas. In 284 BC, Lysimachus invaded Pyrrhus' half of Macedonia with a huge army.<ref>In 301 BC, at the Battle of Ipsus, Lysimachus had fielded 40,000 troops. Since then he had acquired half of Macedonia and western Asia Minor. With these combined assets his army could have numbered over 70,000 troops. Pyrrhus commanded 40,000 troops at best.</ref> Unable to stand against Lysimachus' superior army Pyrrhus retreated and linked up with Antigonus Gonatas. Lysimachus started a propaganda campaign in which he appealed to the patriotism of the Macedonians serving Pyrrhus. He reminded them that Pyrrhus was in fact a foreign king while he himself was a true Macedonian. The campaign was successful. With his Macedonian troops turning against him Pyrrhus had no other choice but to withdraw to Epirus. Lysimachus invaded an plundered Epirus the following year. Pyrrhus did not oppose Lysimachus for he was probably fighting a war in Illyria to the north. According to Pausanius, \"Pyrrhus was roaming around as usual\".<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=37\u201339}}; {{harvnb|Greenwalt|2010|p=298: \"From 288 until 284, Pyrrhus and Lysimachus shared the rule of Macedonia until the latter drove the former back to Epirus (Plut., ''Pyrrhus'' 7\u201312).\"}}; Pausanius.

Tarentum was now faced with a Roman attack and certain defeat, unless they could enlist the aid of greater powers. Rome had already made itself into a major power, and was poised to subdue all the Greek cities in [[Magna Graecia]].

There are conflicting sources about casualties.

He then offered the Romans a peace treaty which was eventually rejected. Pyrrhus tried to wrest [[Campania]] from the Romans, but was twarted in this by the reinforced army of Laevinus. He then boldly marched on Rome itself, but found its defences too formidable. Meanwhile, the Romans had made peace with the Etruscans and had recalled [[Tiberius Coruncanius]], the other consul, who was marching his army southwards from [[Etruria]] towards Rome. Pyrrhus now faced three armies; the garrison of Rome, Laevinus from the south and Curuncanius from the north.

The Greek cities in [[Sicily]] asked him to come and drive out [[Carthage]], which along with Rome was one of the two great powers of the Western [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]. At the same time, the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], whose King [[Ptolemy Keraunos]] had been killed by invading [[Gauls]], asked Pyrrhus to ascend the throne of Macedon. Pyrrhus decided that Sicily offered him a greater opportunity, and transferred his army there.<ref name=BritA/>\n\nSoon after landing in Sicily, he lifted the Carthaginian [[Siege of Syracuse (278 BC)|siege of Syracuse]] in the same year. Pyrrhus was proclaimed king of Sicily. He was already making plans for his son Helenus to inherit the kingdom of Sicily and his other son Alexander to be given Italy. In 277 BC, Pyrrhus captured [[Eryx (Sicily)|Eryx]], the strongest Carthaginian fortress in Sicily. This prompted the rest of the Carthaginian-controlled cities to defect to Pyrrhus.\n\nIn 276 BC, Pyrrhus negotiated with the Carthaginians. Although they were inclined to come to terms with Pyrrhus, supply him money and send him ships once friendly relations were established, he demanded that Carthage abandon all of Sicily and make the Libyan Sea a boundary between themselves and the Greeks. The Greek cities of Sicily opposed making peace with Carthage because the Carthaginians still controlled the powerful fortress of [[Lilybaeum]], on the western end of the island. Pyrrhus eventually gave in to their proposals and broke off the peace negotiations. Pyrrhus' army then began [[Siege of Lilybaeum|besieging Lilybaeum]]. For two months he launched unsuccessful assaults on the city, until finally he realized he could not mount an effective siege without blockading it from the sea as well. Pyrrhus then requested manpower and money from the Sicilians in order to construct a powerful fleet. When the Sicilians became unhappy about these contributions he had to resort to compulsory contributions and force to keep them in line. These measures culminated in him proclaiming a military dictatorship of Sicily and installing military garrisons in Sicilian cities.<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=97\u2013108}}.</ref>\n\nThese actions were deeply unpopular and soon Sicilian opinion became inflamed against him. Pyrrhus had so alienated the Sicilian Greeks that they were willing to make common cause with the Carthaginians. The Carthaginians took heart from this and sent another army against him. This army was promptly defeated. In spite of this victory, Sicily continued to grow increasingly hostile to Pyrrhus, who began to consider abandoning Sicily. At this point, Samnite and Tarentine envoys reached Pyrrhus and informed him that of all the Greek cities in Italy, only Tarentum had not been conquered by Rome. Pyrrhus made his decision and departed from Sicily. As his ship left the island, he turned and, foreshadowing the [[Punic Wars]], said to his companions: \"What a wrestling ground we are leaving, my friends, for the Carthaginians and the Romans.\"<ref>{{harvnb|Garouphalias|1979|pp=109\u2013112}}.</ref><ref>Plutarch.

When Pyrrhus returned from Sicily, he found himself vastly outnumbered against a superior Roman army under [[Manius Curius Dentatus]]. After the inconclusive [[Battle of Beneventum (275 BC)|Battle of Beneventum]] in 275 BC, Pyrrhus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus which resulted in the loss of essentially all the gains he had made in Italy.

He won an easy victory at the [[Battle of the Aous (274 BC)|Battle of the Aous]] and took most of Macedon.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|pp=125\u2013128}}; Plutarch.

Furthermore Pyrrhus made himself very unpopular in Macedon by allowing his Gauls to plunder the tombs of the Macedonian kings at Aegae.<ref>{{harvnb|Champion|2009|p=128}}.</ref> \n\nIn 272 BC, [[Cleonymus of Sparta|Cleonymus]], a [[Sparta]]n of royal blood who was hated among fellow Spartans, asked Pyrrhus to attack Sparta and place him in power. Pyrrhus agreed to the plan, intending to win control of the [[Peloponnese]] for himself, but unexpected strong resistance thwarted his [[Siege of Sparta|assault on Sparta]]. On the retreat he lost his firstborn son [[Ptolemy (son of Pyrrhus)|Ptolemy]], who had been in command of the rearguard.\n\nPyrrhus had little time to mourn, as he was immediately offered an opportunity to intervene in a civic dispute in [[Pyrrhus'_invasion_of_the_Peloponnese#Battle_of_Argos|Argos]]. Since Antigonus Gonatas was approaching too, he hastened to enter the city with his army by stealth, only to find the place crowded with hostile troops. During the confused [[Battle of Argos]] in the narrow city streets, Pyrrhus was trapped.  While he was fighting an Argive soldier, the soldier's old mother, who was watching from a rooftop, threw a tile which knocked him from his horse and broke part of his spine, paralyzing him.  Whether he was alive or not after the blow is unknown, but his death was assured when a Macedonian soldier named Zopyrus, though frightened by the look on the face of the unconscious king, hesitantly and ineptly beheaded his motionless body. This story is later recounted by Plutarch in his ''Life of Pyrrhus.'' \n\nAntigonus had him cremated with all honours and sent his surviving son Helenus back to Epirus. That same year, upon hearing the news of Pyrrhus's death, the Tarentinians surrendered to Rome.\n\n==Legacy==\n[[File:20140415 ioannina524.JPG|upright=0.5|thumb|A statue of Pyrrhus in [[Ioannina]], [[Greece]].]]\n\nIn his ''Life of Pyrrhus'', [[Plutarch]] records that [[Hannibal]] ranked him as the greatest commander the world had ever seen,<ref name = \"Plutarch\"/> though in the ''Life of Titus Quinctius Flamininus'', Plutarch writes that Hannibal placed him second after [[Alexander the Great]].

As a general, Pyrrhus's greatest political weaknesses were his failures to maintain focus and to maintain a strong treasury at home (many of his soldiers were costly mercenaries). \n\nHis name is famous for the term \"[[Pyrrhic victory]]\" which refers to an exchange at the Battle of Asculum. In response to congratulations for winning a costly victory over the Romans, he is reported to have said: \"If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined\".<ref name=\"Plutarch21.9\" />\n\nPyrrhus and his campaign in Italy was effectively the only chance for Greece to check the advance of Rome towards domination of the Mediterranean world. Rather than banding together, the various Hellenistic powers continued to quarrel among themselves, sapping the financial and military strength of Greece and to a lesser extent, Macedon and the greater Hellenistic world. By 197 BC, Macedonia and many southern Greek city-states became Roman client states; in 188 BC, the [[Seleucid Empire]] was forced to cede most of [[Asia Minor]] to Rome's ally [[Pergamon]] (Pergamum). Rome inherited that state, and most of Asia Minor in 133 BC. Total Roman domination over Greece proper was marked by the [[Battle of Corinth (146 BC)|destruction of Corinth]] in 146 BC; Greece then formed an integral part of the Roman world leading into the [[Byzantine]] period.\n\nPyrrhus wrote memoirs and several books on the art of war.

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].\n\n==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

SEG could not secure home-video releases for ''[[UFC 23]]'' through ''[[UFC 29]]''. With other mixed martial arts promotions working towards U.S. sanctioning, the International Fighting Championships (IFC) secured the first U.S. sanctioned mixed-martial-arts event, which occurred in New Jersey on September 30, 2000.

After an extension was reached to continue Strikeforce through 2012, the promotion's heavyweight division (sans Heavyweight Grand Prix finalists) was merged into the UFC, and the promotion's Challengers series was ended.\n\nThe final Strikeforce show was [[Strikeforce: Marquardt vs. Saffiedine]] on January 12, 2013, after which the promotion was dissolved and all fighter contracts were either ended or absorbed into the UFC.\n\n====Fox partnership====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right;\"\n|+'''''UFC on Fox'' [[Nielsen

The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose use of a prohibited substance prior to testing.

Retrieved April 3, 2006.</ref> The set of \"[[Mixed martial arts rules#Unified Rules of MMA|Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]\" that New Jersey established has been adopted in other states that regulate mixed martial arts, including Nevada, Louisiana, and California. These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances. There is a one-minute rest period between rounds.\n\n==={{anchor|Octagon}} Cage===\n[[File:Chris Weidman knock out Anderson Silva at UFC 162..jpg|thumb|Shot of the Octagon as [[Chris Weidman]] upsets [[Anderson Silva]] at [[UFC 162]].]]\nThe UFC stages bouts in an eight-sided enclosure officially named \"The Octagon\". Originally, SEG trademarked the concept as well as the term and prevented other mixed martial arts promotions from using the same type of cage, but in 2001 Zuffa gave permission for other promotions to use octagonal cages, reasoning that the young sport needed uniformity to continue to win official sanctioning. Today Zuffa reserves exclusive use of the name \"The Octagon\".<ref>Gentry, Clyde, ''No Holds Barred: Ultimate Fighting and the Martial Arts Revolution'', (Milo Books: Preston, 2005), p.208</ref>\n\nThe UFC cage is an octagonal structure with walls of metal chain-link fence coated with black vinyl.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts. During the finales for each series, the division finals have the standard three rounds, plus a fourth round if the judges score a tie.\n\n==Weight divisions/Current champions==\n[[File:UFC-Champs.PNG|1000px|thumb|left]]\n{{See also|Mixed martial arts weight classes}}\n{{See also|List of UFC champions}}\n\nThe UFC currently uses nine different weight classes:<ref name=\"ufc.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations#2|title=Rules and Regulations \u2013 Unified Rules and Other MMA Regulations|publisher=UFC|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105020540/https://www.ufc.com/discover/sport/rules-and-regulations|archivedate=2018-01-05}}</ref>\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 80%;\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Weight class name\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Minimum Weight (lb)\n!colspan=\"3\"|Upper limit\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Gender\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Current champion\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Date won\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Days<br />held \n!rowspan=\"2\"|Defenses\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Next Fight\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Ref\n|-\n!in [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (lb)\n!in kilograms (kg)\n!in [[Stone (unit)|stone]] (st)\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|align=\"left\"|[[Strawweight (MMA)|Strawweight]]\n|None\n|115\n|52.2\n|8&nbsp;st 3&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#F19CBB;|Women \n| style=\"background:#F19CBB;|{{flagicon|CHN}} [[Weili Zhang]]\n| August 31, 2019\n|<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cagesidepress.com/2019/08/31/ufc-shenzhen-results-andrade-vs-zhang/|title=UFC Shenzhen Results: Weili Zhang Shocks With Quick TKO of Andrade, Becomes First Chinese UFC Champ|last=McClory|first=Mike|date=2019-08-31|website=Cageside Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-31}}</ref>\n|{{age in days|month1=08|day1=31|year1=2019}}\n| 1\n| (TBA)\n|\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n| rowspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:left;\"|[[Flyweight (MMA)|Flyweight]]\n|rowspan=2|116\n|rowspan=2|125\n|rowspan=2|56.7\n|rowspan=2|8&nbsp;st 13&nbsp;lb \n|style=\"background:#BBF;

Fighters will typically get paid money to fight, called show money, with an additional bonus if they win, called a win bonus. Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million.

With the {{convert|175|lb|kg|abbr=on}} Royce Gracie winning three of the first four events, the UFC quickly proved that size does not always determine the outcome of the fight.\n\nDuring this early part of the organization, the UFC would showcase a bevy of different styles and fighters. Aside from the aforementioned [[Royce Gracie]], [[Ken Shamrock]], and [[Patrick Smith (fighter)|Patrick Smith]], the competitions also featured competitors such as [[List of halls and walks of fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Dan Severn]], [[Marco Ruas]], [[Gary Goodridge]], [[Don Frye]], [[Kimo Leopoldo]], [[Oleg Taktarov]], and [[Tank Abbott]]. Although the first events were dominated by jiu-jitsu, other fighting styles became successful: first wrestling, then [[ground and pound]], kickboxing, boxing, and [[Clinch fighting|dirty boxing]], which eventually melded into modern [[mixed martial arts]].\n\nIn April 1995, following ''[[UFC 5]]'' in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], Davie and Gracie sold their interest in the franchise to SEG and disbanded WOW Promotions. Davie continued with SEG as the show's booker and matchmaker, as well as the commissioner of Ultimate Fighting, until December 1997.\n\n====Emergence of stricter rules====\nAlthough UFC used the tagline \"There are no rules\" in the early 1990s, the UFC did in fact operate with limited rules. It banned biting and eye-gouging, and allowed techniques such as hair pulling, [[headbutt]]ing, [[groin attack|groin strikes]], and [[fish-hooking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nIn a ''[[UFC 4]]'' qualifying match, competitors Jason Fairn and [[Guy Mezger]] agreed not to pull hair\u2014as they both wore pony tails tied back for the match. That same event saw a matchup between [[Keith Hackney]] and [[Joe Son]] in which Hackney unleashed a series of groin shots against Son while on the ground.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\nThe UFC had a reputation, especially in the early days, as an extremely violent event, as evidenced by a disclaimer in the beginning of the ''[[UFC 5]]'' broadcast which warned audiences of the violent nature of the sport.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n''UFC 5'' also introduced the first singles match, a rematch from the inaugural UFC featuring three-time champion Royce Gracie and Ken Shamrock, called \"The Superfight\". This proved an important development, because singles matches would feature fighters who suffered no prior damage from a previous fight in the same event, unlike tournament matches. Singles matches would become a staple in the UFC for years to come.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}\n\n\"The Superfight\" began as a non-tournament match that would determine the first reigning UFC Champion for tournament winners to face;<ref>\n{{cite web |last=Meltzer |first=Dave |url= https://sports.yahoo.com/mma/news;_ylt=AnbS9oIfkDYxeule15884RJZEo14?slug=dm-ufcsix040809&prov=yhoo&type=lgns |title=Relive UFC 6: Clash of the Titans |work=Sports.yahoo.com |date=April 8, 2009 |accessdate=April 8, 2009}}</ref> it later evolved into a match that could feature either title matches or non-title matches. The \"Superfight\" would eventually completely phase out tournament matches; by ''[[UFC Brazil]]'', the UFC abandoned the tournament format for an entire card of singles matches (aside from a one-time ''[[UFC 23|UFC Japan]]'' tournament featuring Japanese fighters). ''[[UFC 6]]'' was the first event to feature the crowning of the first non-tournament UFC Champion, [[Ken Shamrock]].\n\n==={{anchor|Controversy and reform}}Controversy and reform: late 1990s===\nThe violent nature of the burgeoning sport quickly drew the attention of the U.S. authorities.<ref>{{cite news|last=Flegenheimer|first=Matt|title=No Resolution for Mixed Martial Arts|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/27/nyregion/obstacles-in-push-to-legalize-mixed-martial-arts-in-new-york.html?_r=1&ref=mixedmartialarts|accessdate=December 31, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=June 26, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn 1996, Senator [[John McCain]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Arizona|AZ]]) saw a tape of the first UFC events and immediately found it abhorrent.

''UFC 12'' saw the introduction of weight classes and the banning of [[fish-hooking]]. For ''[[UFC 14]]'', gloves became mandatory, while kicks to the head of a downed opponent were banned. ''[[UFC 15]]'' saw limitations on hair pulling, and the banning of strikes to the back of the neck and head, headbutting, small-joint manipulations, and groin strikes.

The same rule applies to returning fighters who were terminated or whose contracts were not renewed at the decision of the UFC.  Previously, returning or terminated fighters were required to undergo four months of testings prior to competing in a fight. (2)  Returning fighters who have chosen to retire, go on hiatus, or had a non-renewal of their contract,  are required to be in a six-months testing pool prior to competition. (3) No doping violation is handed down to newly signed UFC fighters who voluntarily disclose use of a prohibited substance prior to testing. (4) \"In-competition\" testing begins at noon on the weigh-in day and ends one hour after a fighter clears a post-fight medical for non-selected post-fight testing. For fighters who are subjected to post-fight testing the in-competition testing ends after any post-fight testing is done.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mmaimports.com/2017/03/usada-drug-testing-policies-loosen-up-for-ufc-fighters-heres-the-update/|title=USADA Drug Testing Policies Loosen Up For UFC Fighters, Here's The Update|date=2017-03-29|website=MMA Imports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloodyelbow.com/2017/12/11/16740288/ufc-usada-loophole-secret-exemptions-from-drug-testing-peds-steroids|title=UFC-USADA loophole could be letting chosen athletes avoid testing in secret|last=Kidd|first=Iain|date=2017-12-11|website=Bloody Elbow|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/sports/ufc-and-usada-make-significant-changes-to-anti-doping-policy|title=UFC and USADA make significant changes to anti-doping policy|date=2017-02-17|website=FoxSports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nIn September 2018, indicated no announcements would be made on fighters who have been flagged for a potential doping violation until the entire adjudication processes are conducted with the results of the potential doping violation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lowkickmma.com/ufc-makes-major-changes-to-usada-drug-testing-policy/|title=UFC Makes Major Changes To USADA Drug-Testing Policy|last=Drahota|first=Mike|last2=MMA|first2=LowKick|date=2018-09-29|website=LowKickMMA.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mmanytt.com/ufc/ufc-and-usada-make-major-change-to-anti-doping-policy-going-forward/|title=UFC and USADA Make Major Change to Anti-Doping Policy Going Forward|date=2018-09-29|website=MMAnytt.com|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref> This came after several cases of fighters, such as [[Anderson Silva]], [[Junior dos Santos]], [[Josh Barnett]] and [[Cris Cyborg]], being flagged for potential doping violations, but cleared after they were proved of unintentional use of [[performance enhancing drug]]s (usually in the form of contaminated supplements).<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mmafighting.com/2018/9/29/17918010/ufc-changes-policy-on-when-it-announces-failed-drug-tests|title=UFC changes policy on when it announces failed drug tests|work=MMA Fighting|access-date=2018-09-29}}</ref> On November 25, 2019, news surfaced that the UFC and USADA had revised their policies, providing a list of certified supplements that will not lead to sanctions should contaminated samples occur.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/2019/11/ufc-usada-anti-doping-policy-changes-announced|title=UFC, USADA address contaminated supplements issue with 'significant changes' to anti-doping policy|author=Simon Head|publisher=mmajunkie.com|date=November 25, 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, USADA conducted 353 tests and 2291 tests in 2016 on 586 UFC fighters with [[Anderson Silva]] tested the most of a total of 15 times.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/ufc/gallery/here-are-the-ufc-fighters-usada-tested-the-most-in-2016-022317|title=Here are the UFC fighters USADA tested the most in 2016|last=ET|first=2017 at 3:01p|website=FOX Sports|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>  In 2017 and 2018 a total of 2818 and 2888 tests were conducted by USADA respectively.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ufc.usada.org/testing/results/testing-numbers/|title=Testing Numbers|website=UFC Anti-Doping Program|language=en-US|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\nAs of May 16, 2019, a total of  76 UFC fighters have been sanctioned by USADA since the UFC USADA testing program started.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mma-insiders.com/a-quick-look-at-all-usada-banned-ufc-fighters-since-2016-reveals-bellators-problem/|title=A quick look at all USADA banned UFC fighters since 2016 - Reveals Bellator's problem.|date=2019-05-16|website=Combat Arena|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\nThe current rules for the Ultimate Fighting Championship were originally established by the [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board|New Jersey Athletic Control Board]].<ref>[http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html Mixed Martial Arts Unified Rules of Conduct, Additional Mixed Martial Arts Rules] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090403062008/http://www.state.nj.us/lps/sacb/docs/martial.html |date=April 3, 2009 }}, New Jersey Athletic Control Board.

These rules are also used by many other promotions within the United States, becoming mandatory for those states that have adopted the rules, and so have become the standard ''de facto'' set of rules for professional mixed martial arts across the country.\n\n===Rounds===\nUFC matches vary in maximum length, depending on whether the match is for a Championship title, or  is a fight card's \"main event\" fight. In all fights, each round can be no longer than five minutes.  Championship fights last for a maximum of five rounds. Beginning with [[UFC 138]] on November 5, 2011, non-championship \"main event\" fights (i.e. the final fight on the card) will also last for a maximum of five rounds. Non-main event bouts last for a maximum of three rounds. [[UFC on FX: Alves vs. Kampmann]] featured the organization's first two flyweight fights as part of its first flyweight tournament, which consists of bouts that, in the event of a draw, go to a fourth \"sudden victory\" round held to determine the winner, who advances.

Many fighters still chose to wear tight-fitting shorts or boxing-type trunks, while others wore long pants or singlets. Several wore wrestling shoes. Multi-time tournament Champion [[Royce Gracie]] wore a Brazilian jiu-jitsu [[Keikogi|gi]] in all of his early appearances in UFC (Gracie wore shorts against Matt Hughes at UFC 60), while [[Art Jimmerson]] appeared in UFC 1 wearing one standard boxing glove.  As of [[UFC 133]] there has been a ban on speedo style shorts after [[Dennis Hallman]] wore one in his fight against [[Brian Ebersole]].  UFC president [[Dana White]] was so furious about the fighter's choice of attire that he awarded an honorary \"getting those horrifying shorts off TV as soon as possible\" bonus to Ebersole for finishing the fight in the first round, and in following post-fight interviews made it clear that speedo style shorts will no longer be tolerated.\n\n====Reebok Uniform====\nOn December 2, 2014, the UFC and [[Reebok]] held a press conference to announce an exclusive deal for Reebok to become the worldwide outfitter for the UFC, beginning in July 2015. Financial terms of the six-year partnership were not released, but UFC officials said that though the agreement represents the most valuable non-broadcast contract the company has ever signed, the UFC will not directly profit from the new deal. Instead, company execs said the deal is structured so that the \"vast majority of the revenue\" from the deal \u2013 taking out only the costs associated with administering the new program \u2013 will be paid directly to UFC fighters.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\">{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2014/12/ufc-partners-with-reebok-for-uniform-program-rankings-to-determine-fighter-pay|title=UFC partners with Reebok for uniform program; rankings to determine fighter pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=John Morgan|date=December 2, 2014|accessdate=December 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\nPayment on the new deal was originally expected to be based on the fighter's spot in the official [[UFC rankings]], with the exception of the UFC champions. Fighters ranked No. 1 to 5 would be paid at one level, No. 6 to 10 at a lower level, No. 11 to 15 below that, and unranked fighters at a base rate.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> The payments would remain consistent regardless of where the athletes' bouts air. In addition to the per-fight rate, fighters would also receive royalty payments representing 20 percent of any UFC merchandise sold that bears their likeness. The royalty program would also include retired fighters and continue in perpetuity. The deal itself was reported to be worth 70 million dollars which was what the fighters would be paid over the next six years which is roughly 260 thousand dollars per UFC fight card.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" /> In April 2015, the UFC announced that they scrapped the rankings idea and that payment will be based on the fighter's number of bouts in the octagon, with different tiers (1-5 fights, 6-10 fights, 11-15 fights, and 16-20 fights). Exceptions are made in the event of title fights, with champions and title challengers receiving greater compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/04/ufc-fighter-rankings-will-no-longer-determine-reebok-sponsorship-pay|title=UFC: Fighter rankings will no longer determine Reebok sponsorship pay|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Steven Marrocco|date=April 20, 2015|accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The kits were revealed on June 30, 2015. All kits feature the fighter's name on the back of the jersey and fighters have the option to choose between a universal kit or a country kit, related to his nationality. There is also a champion kit, designed to be used only by title holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmajunkie.com/2015/06/what-you-need-to-know-about-new-ufc-reebok-fight-kit-uniforms-and-gear|title=What you need to know about new UFC-Reebok 'fight kit' uniforms and gear|publisher=mmajunkie.com|author=Staff|date=June 30, 2015|accessdate=June 30, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe new deal meant that beginning with fight week for [[UFC 189]] in Las Vegas, existing sponsors no longer appear on fighter clothing \u2013 not only on fight night, but also at all pre-fight media appearances \u2013 and in-cage sponsor banners have also eliminated. Fighter camps are outfitted with approved clothing to create a uniform look in athletes' corners. Existing sponsors are still welcome to support UFC fighters. However, third-party logos are no longer allowed on UFC broadcasts, other than title-sponsor slots \u2013 similar to those seen with European soccer clubs \u2013 that the UFC may eventually sell to \"a major, global brand\" down the road.<ref name=\"ReebokUniform\" />\n\n===Match outcome===\nMatches may end via:\n*'''[[Submission (combat sport term)|Submission]]''': a fighter clearly taps the mat or his opponent, verbally submits, or clearly communicates being in pain (such as by yelling) to a degree that causes the referee to stop the fight. Also, a technical submission may be called when a fighter either loses consciousness or is on the verge of or suffers serious injury while in a hold.\n*'''[[Knockout]]''': a fighter is put into a state of unconsciousness resulting from any legal strike.\n*'''[[Technical Knockout]]''' (TKO): If the referee decides a fighter cannot continue, the fight is ruled as a technical knockout. Technical knockouts can be classified into three categories:\n**referee stoppage (the referee ends the fight because one fighter is deemed unable to intelligently defend himself)\n**doctor stoppage (a ring side doctor decides that it is unsafe for one fighter to continue the bout, due to excessive bleeding or physical injuries)\n**corner stoppage (a fighter's cornerman signals defeat for his own fighter)\n*'''Judges' Decision''': Depending on scoring, a match may end as:\n**unanimous decision (all three judges score a win for fighter A)\n**majority decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a draw)\n**split decision (two judges score a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B)\n**technical decision (a fighter is rendered unable to continue as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move, resulting in a decision based on the finished and unfinished rounds if the number of rounds to be judged is sufficient)\n**unanimous draw (all three judges score a draw)\n**majority draw (two judges score a draw, one judge scoring a win)\n**split draw (one judge scores a win for fighter A, one judge scores a win for fighter B, and one judge scores a draw)\n**technical draw (the bout ends in a manner similar to that of a technical decision, with the judges' scores resulting in a draw)\n*'''Disqualification''': a fighter intentionally executes an illegal move that is considered by the referee or opponent to be injurious or significant enough to negatively alter the opponent's performance should the fight continue, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''Forfeit''': a fighter fails to compete or intentionally and prematurely ends the bout for a reason besides injury, resulting in the opponent's victory.\n*'''No Contest''': a fighter is rendered unable to continue or compete effectively as a result of an unintentional illegal element or move and there is not a sufficient number of finished rounds to be judged to make a technical decision viable, or both fighters are rendered unable to continue or compete effectively. Also, a fight may be ruled a no contest if the original outcome of the bout is changed due to unsatisfactory or illegal circumstances, such as a premature stoppage or a fighter's testing positive for banned substances.\n\nIn the event of a draw, it is not necessary that the fighters' total ''points'' be equal (see, e.g., ''[[UFC 41]]'' Penn vs. Uno, or ''[[UFC 43]]'' Freeman vs. White). However, in a unanimous or split draw, each fighter does score an equal number of ''win judgments'' from the three judges (0 or 1, respectively). Additionally, if a title fight ends in a draw, the defending champ retains the title.\n\n===Judging criteria===\nThe [[10-point must system|ten-point must system]] is in effect for all UFC fights; three judges score each round and the winner of each receives ten points while the loser receives nine points or fewer (although 10\u201310 rounds are given in the rare event that a judge feels the rounds was too close to warrant giving one fighter 10 and the other 9.)  Scores of 10\u20138 are typically awarded for dominant rounds and anything more dominant is scored less. 10\u20137 rounds are very rare.\n\n===Fouls===\nThe Nevada State Athletic Commission currently lists the following as fouls:<ref>[http://www.leg.state.nv.us/NAC/NAC-467.html NSAC Regulations: Chapter 467 \u2013 Unarmed Combat].

If a foul incapacitates a fighter, then the match may end in a disqualification if the foul was intentional, or a no contest if unintentional. If a foul causes a fighter to be unable to continue later in the bout, it ends with a technical decision win to the injured fighter if the injured fighter is ahead on points, otherwise it is a technical draw.<ref>[http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf MMA rules explained.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615195416/http://boxing.nv.gov/docs/MMA%20RULES%20Expained.pdf |date=June 15, 2006 }} Nevada State Athletic Commission. Retrieved June 30, 2006.</ref>\n\n===Match conduct===\n*After a verbal warning the referee can stop the fighters and stand them up if they reach a stalemate on the ground (where neither are in a dominant [[Grappling position|position]] or working towards one). This rule is codified in Nevada as the ''stand-up rule''.\n*If the referee pauses the match, it is resumed with the fighters in their prior positions.\n*Grabbing the cage brings a verbal warning, followed by an attempt by the referee to release the grab by pulling on the grabbing hand. If that attempt fails or if the fighter continues to hold the cage, the referee may charge a foul.\n*Early UFC events disregarded verbal sparring / \"trash-talking\" during matches. Under unified rules, antics are permitted before events to add to excitement and allow fighters to express themselves, but abusive language during combat is prohibited.\n\n===Evolution of the rules===\n*''[[UFC 1]]'' \u2013 Although the advertising said ''There Are No Rules'', there were in fact some rules: no biting, no eye-gouging and no groin attacks. Fights ended only in the event of a knockout, submission or the corner throwing in the towel. Despite this, the first match in ''UFC 1'' was won by referee stoppage, even though it was not officially recognized as such at the time.\n*''[[UFC 2]]'' \u2013 Groin attacks were unbanned. Time limits were dropped ending the need for judges. Modifications to the cage were added (the fence became 5 feet tall but would continually grow in height afterwards and the floor became the canvas that is still used today).\n*''[[UFC 3]]'' \u2013 The referee was officially given the authority to stop a fight in case of a fighter being unable to defend himself. A fighter could not kick if he was wearing shoes. This rule would later be discarded, then changed to 'no kicking with shoes while on the ground' and then reinstated, before finally being discarded.\n*''[[UFC 4]]'' \u2013 After tournament alternate [[Steve Jennum]] won ''UFC 3'' by winning only one bout, alternates (replacements) were required to win a pre-tournament bout to qualify for the role of an alternate.\n*''[[UFC 5]]'' \u2013 The organizers introduced a 30-minute time limit. ''UFC 5'' also saw the first Superfight, a one-off bout between two competitors selected by the organizers with the winner being crowned 'Superfight champion' and having the duty of defending his title at the next UFC.\n*''[[UFC 6]]'' \u2013 The referee was given the authority to restart the fight. If two fighters were entangled in a position where there was a ''lack of action'', the referee could stop the fight and restart the competitors on their feet, in their own corner. In ''UFC 6'' they officially adopted the 5-minute extension to the 30-minute rule which had been used in ''UFC 5''.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1995]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the no fish-hooking rule and to reinstate judges. Time limits were changed to 15 minutes in the quarter-finals, 18 minutes in the semi-finals and 27 minutes in the finals.\n*''[[UFC 8]]'' \u2013 Time limits changed to 10 minutes in the first two rounds of the tournament, 15 minutes in the tournament final and Superfight. Time limits would continually change in the later UFC events. Fights could now be decided by a judges decision if the fight reached the end of the time limit. The panel was made up of three judges who simply raised a card with the name of the fighter they considered to be the winner. In this fashion, a draw was not possible since the only two possible outcomes of a decision were 3 to 0 or 2 to 1 in favor of the winner.\n*''[[UFC 9]]'' \u2013 To appease local authorities, closed fisted strikes to the head were banned for this event only. The commentators were not aware of this last minute rule that was made to prevent the cancellation of the event due to local political pressures. Referee [[John McCarthy (referee)|\"Big John\" McCarthy]] made repeated warnings to the fighters to \"open the hand\" when this rule was violated. However, not one fighter was reprimanded. UFC 9 was also the last UFC event to feature the superfight.\n*''[[Ultimate Ultimate 1996]]'' \u2013 This event was the first to introduce the \"no grabbing of the fence\" rule.\n*''[[UFC 12]]'' \u2013 The main tournament split into a heavyweight (over 200&nbsp;lbs.) and lightweight (200&nbsp;lbs. and under) division; and the eight-man tournament ceased. Fighters now needed to win only two fights to win the competition. The Heavyweight Champion title (and title bouts) was introduced, replacing the Superfight title (albeit matches were still for a time branded as \"Superfights\").\n*''[[UFC 14]]'' \u2013 The lightweight division was re-branded middleweight. The wearing of padded gloves, weighing 110 to 170&nbsp;g (4 to 6&nbsp;ounces), becomes mandatory. Gloves were to be approved by the UFC. Hair-pulling, groin strikes and kicks to a downed opponent became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 15]]'' \u2013 Limits on permissible striking areas were introduced. Headbutts, elbow strikes to the back of the neck and head and small joint manipulation became illegal.\n*''[[UFC 21]]'' \u2013 Five minute rounds were introduced, with preliminary bouts consisting of two rounds, regular non-title bouts at three rounds, and title bouts at five rounds. The \"ten-point must system\" was introduced for scoring fights (identical to the system widely used in boxing).\n* ''[[UFC 28]]'' \u2013 The [[New Jersey State Athletic Control Board]] sanctions its first UFC event, using the newly developed ''[[Unified Rules of Mixed Martial Arts]]''. Major changes to the UFC's rules included barring knee strikes to the head of a downed opponent, elbow strikes to the spine and neck and punches to the back of the neck and head. Limits on permissible ring attire, stringent medical requirements, and regulatory oversight were also introduced. A new weight class system was also introduced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ivansblog.com/2006/07/mixed-martial-arts-new-jersey.html|title=Ivan's Blog--- Ivan Trembow's Self-Important, Random Rants on Mixed Martial Arts, Video Games, Pro Wrestling, Television, Politics, Sports, and High-Quality Wool Socks|work=ivansblog.com}}</ref> This new set of rules is currently the ''de facto'' standard for MMA events held in the U.S. and is still in use by the UFC.\n* ''[[UFC 31]]'' \u2013 Weight classes are re-aligned to the current standard.

Match outcomes also do not need to be immediately posted publicly, which allows for fight results to remain unknown to the public until the airdate of the episode.\n\nFor two-round matches, if there is a draw after two rounds, an extra five-minute round (\"[[sudden victory]]\") is contested. If the extra round concludes without a stoppage, the judges' decision will be based on that final round.\n\nThese exhibition matches variably have two or three rounds, depending on the rules used for each season. In most seasons, preliminary matches (before the semi-final bouts) were two rounds; in season two, all matches had three rounds. All matches past the first round use three rounds as per standard UFC bouts.

Despite not being officially confirmed by the UFC, [[Justin Gaethje]] revealed in January 2019 that headlining an event nets additional $25,000 per fighter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mmamania.com/2019/1/28/18201022/ufc-justin-gaethje-case-higher-headliner-pay-pass-away-in-rounds-four-five-mma|author=Adam Guillen Jr.|publisher=mmamania.com|title=Justin Gaethje wants a UFC pay raise in case he dies in the fourth round}}</ref> While fighters new to the UFC can make as little as about $10,000 per fight (without a win bonus), more established fighters have made as much as $500,000 to $1 million per fight. Occasionally, fighters will earn more. For example, at [[UFC 202]], [[Conor McGregor]] made a reported $3 million, a UFC record for one fight, while his opponent [[Nate Diaz]] made a reported $2 million. The combined $5 million made between the fighters was the largest combined fight purse in UFC history.<ref>{{cite web |title=Conor McGregor Breaks Brock Lesnar's Record for Biggest Fight Purse at UFC 202 |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2658946-conor-mcgregor-breaks-brock-lesnars-record-for-biggest-fight-purse-at-ufc-202 |website=BleacherReport.com}}</ref>\n\nCash bonuses are also awarded for \"Fight of the Night\" and \"Performance of the Night\" (formerly awarded separately as \"Knockout of the Night\").<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mmanuts.com/news/ufc-eliminates-ko-submission-night-awards/|title=UFC Eliminates KO and Submission of the Night Awards |publisher=mmanuts.com|author=Dave Walsh |date=February 11, 2014|accessdate= February 11, 2014}}</ref> The size of these bonuses can sometimes be US$80,000 (but are normally US$50,000).
