The pioneer in this area was [[Autodesk]], which developed two systems, the ''HighCycle'' and ''Virtual Racquetball''. The ''HighCycle'' was an exercise bike that a user would pedal through a virtual landscape. If the user pedaled fast enough, the virtual bike would take off and fly over the landscape. ''Virtual Racquetball'' tracked the position and orientation of an actual racquet that was used to hit a virtual ball in a virtual environment. This environment was shared with another user equipped with another tracked racquet, allowing the two users to play each other over phone lines. In both systems, the users could wear the ''VPL eyephones'', an early [[head-mounted display]] (HMD), that would provide more immersion for the user.<ref name=\"Virtual Reality\">Howard Rheingold. \"Virtual Reality\" pp188-189 ''[[Simon & Schuster]].''  1991. {{ISBN|0-671-77897-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe first true attempt at what would later be called Exertainment was the [[Atari]] ''Puffer'' project (1982). This was an exercise bike that would hook up to an Atari 400/800 or 5200 system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/othersec/puffer/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322111652/http://www.atarihq.com/othersec/puffer/index.html |archivedate=2009-03-22 |title=AGH's Atari Project Puffer Page |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/5200/5200faq/03_04.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322111519/http://www.atarihq.com/5200/5200faq/03_04.html |archivedate=2009-03-22 |title=What Was The Top-Secret \"Puffer Project\"? |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Forward speed was controlled by pedaling while steering and additional gameplay was handled by a handlebar-mounted Gamepad. The machine was nearly ready for production with several games (''Tumbleweeds'' and ''Jungle River Cruise'') when Atari declared bankruptcy and the Puffer project was abandoned. [[Nintendo]] also dabbled in this space with the [[Power Pad]], released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1986.\n\nThe first exergaming system released to the market was the 1986 ''Computrainer''. Designed as a training aid and motivational tool, the ''Computrainer'' allowed users to ride through a virtual landscape generated on an NES, while monitoring data such as power output and pedaling cadence. The product had a price that was far too high to be considered as an entertainment product, but was affordable by dedicated athletes. The product continues to this day, where it now runs using [[Microsoft Windows]] compatible software with extensive graphic and physiological capabilities.\n\nAlso released for the [[NES]] in 1986 was the [[Family Trainer]], which focused on entertainment rather than exercise.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nAbout the same time as the Computrainer, Concept II introduced a computer attachment for their rowing machine. This has become their ''eRow'' product and is used for both individual motivation as well as competition in \"indoor rowing leagues\".\n\n===1990s===\nDuring the 1990s, there was a surge of interest in the application of \"virtual reality\" technologies to high-end gym equipment. Life Fitness and Nintendo partnered to produce the ''Exertainment'' System; Precor had an LCD-based bike product, and Universal had several CRT-based systems. The Netpulse system provided users with the ability to browse the web while exercising. Fitlinxx introduced a system that used sensors attached to weight machines in order to provide automated feedback to users.\n\nThree issues combined to ensure the failure of these systems in the marketplace. First, they were significantly more expensive than the equivalent models that did not have all the additional electronics. Second, they were harder to maintain, and were often left broken. Lastly the additional expertise required to operate the software was often intimidating to the users, who shied away from the machines out of fear that they would look foolish while trying to master the machine.\n\nUntil 1998, nothing significant happened in the field of videogame exercise. Hardware was still too expensive for the average home consumer, and the health clubs were gun-shy about adopting any new technology. As high-performance game console capabilities improved and prices fell, manufacturers once more started to explore the fitness market.\n\nIn 1998, [[Konami]]'s [[Dance Dance Revolution]] was released along with [[Andamiro]]'s [[Pump It Up (video game series)]] a couple months later.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2000, UK startup [[Exertris]] introduced an interactive gaming bike to the commercial fitness market.\n\nExergaming came to the mass media attention at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] when Bill Gates showcased the [[Exertris]] Interactive Gaming Bike in 2003, and the following year the same show hosted a pavilion dedicated to video game technology that also worked as sports and [[exercise equipment]].\n\n[[Image:Gamercize GZ Sport.jpg|thumb|Gamercize played on PlayStation 2]]\nThe 2005 release of the [[EyeToy: Kinetic]] brought the first multi-function exergame hardware into the home market. Making the players physical movements into the game's controller. 2006 saw the launch of [[Gamercize]], combining traditional fitness equipment with game consoles. The minimalist approach allows game play to continue only when exercising, turning all game titles into potential exergames.\n\n[[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] in 2006 brought acceleration detection with the [[Wii Remote]]. In late 2007, Nintendo released the exergame [[Wii Fit]], which utilized a new peripheral, the [[Wii Balance Board]]. The popularity of the Wii lead to it being used in hospital \"Wiihab\" rehabilitation programs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hospitals-discover-the-power-of-wiihab/ |title=Hospitals Discover The Power Of 'Wiihab' |publisher=CBS News |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2015-10-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[PCGamerBike]] appeared at CES in 2007 where it received an Honoree Award. It differs from other exergaming devices in that its pedal motion can be mapped to any key on the keyboard. It also has an optical encoder which detects forward and reverse pedal motion.  The Fisher-Price Smart Cycle was another entry in the field.\n\nOther examples of exergaming products include: Positive Gaming iDANCE, iSTEP, [[Cobalt Flux]] Blufit, [[Cyber coach]], [[NeoRacer]], Gymkids exercise equipment with interactive technology, some [[Wii]] titles such as [[EA Sports Active]], [[Cybex]] TRAZER, Powergrid Fitness Kilowatt, Lightspace Play Floor, [[PlayMotion]], [[Yourself!Fitness]], Expresso Fitness S2, [[i.play]], Cyber ExerCycle, VEQTOR Sport Trainer and Sportwall.\n\n===2010s===\nThe [[Kinect]] (2010) represented a significant advance in how player motion was detected in games, because the player's body became the remote.<ref>{{cite web|first= Michael |last= Rosenberg |url= https://theconversation.com/sorry-gamers-wii-fit-is-no-substitute-for-real-exercise-22375 |title=Sorry gamers, Wii Fit is no substitute for real exercise |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2015-10-28}}</ref> The exergaming trend within consoles that started with the seventh generation [[Wii]] peaked with the [[Nike+ Kinect Training]] (2012) & pedometer-pairing [[Wii Fit U]] (2013) games. These were followed up in the eighth generation by an exergaming push by Microsoft with the [[Xbox One]] launch day [[Xbox Fitness]] service (2013), which tracked metrics such as heart rate and correct form while synchronising these metrics with the [[Microsoft Health]]. By 2017, [[Microsoft]] had pivoted away from [[Kinect]] and exergaming on consoles.

Because it takes longer for a user to move their entire body in response to stimulation from the game, it is often the case that dedicated software must be written for the game to playable. An example of this is [[Konami]]'s ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''. Though designed to be played by users moving about on a specially designed dancepad, that game can alternatively be played by pushing buttons with one's fingers using a standard hand-held gamepad. When played with the dancepad at higher levels the game can be quite challenging (and physically exhausting), but if the game is played using the buttons on the hand controller, none of the sequences are physically limited.\n\nNewer systems such as [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]] and Wii use alternative [[input devices]] such as the [[Kinect]] and [[PlayStation Move]]. The Move uses image analysis to extract the motion of the user against a background and uses these motions to control the character in the game.  A specifically designed exercise game ''Kinetic'', superimposes animated objects to be punched, kicked, or otherwise interacted with over a video image of the user.  The Wii and PlayStation 3 both incorporate motion sensors such as [[accelerometers]] and [[gyroscopes]] into the hand-held controllers that are used to direct behaviors within the game.\n \nResearch projects such as exertion interfaces<ref>{{cite web| first1= Florian |last1= Mueller| first2=Stefan |last2= Agamanolis| first3= Rosalind |last3= Picard| title= Exertion Interfaces: Sports over a Distance for Social Bonding and Fun| date= April 2003| url= http://affect.media.mit.edu/pdfs/03.mueller-agamanolis-picard.pdf | work= CHI '03 Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems| access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref> that investigate the design aspects of these games<ref>{{cite web| first1= Florian |last1= Mueller| first2=Martin R. |last2= Gibbs| first3= Frank |last3= Vetere| title=Design Influence on Social Play in Distributed Exertion Games| work= CHI '09 Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems| pages= 1539\u201348 |date= April 2009| url= http://exertioninterfaces.com/cms/images/stories/pdf/design_chi09.pdf| access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref> explore how the technological augmentation that comes with the digital gameplay component can be nurtured for additional benefits, such as utilizing the social power of exercising together even though players are connected only over a network<ref>[http://exertioninterfaces.com/cms/breakout-for-two.html Breakout for Two].

The pioneer in this area was [[Autodesk]], which developed two systems, the ''HighCycle'' and ''Virtual Racquetball''. The ''HighCycle'' was an exercise bike that a user would pedal through a virtual landscape. If the user pedaled fast enough, the virtual bike would take off and fly over the landscape. ''Virtual Racquetball'' tracked the position and orientation of an actual racquet that was used to hit a virtual ball in a virtual environment. This environment was shared with another user equipped with another tracked racquet, allowing the two users to play each other over phone lines. In both systems, the users could wear the ''VPL eyephones'', an early [[head-mounted display]] (HMD), that would provide more immersion for the user.<ref name=\"Virtual Reality\">Howard Rheingold. \"Virtual Reality\" pp188-189 ''[[Simon & Schuster]].''  1991. {{ISBN|0-671-77897-8}}.</ref>\n\nThe first true attempt at what would later be called Exertainment was the [[Atari]] ''Puffer'' project (1982). This was an exercise bike that would hook up to an Atari 400/800 or 5200 system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/othersec/puffer/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322111652/http://www.atarihq.com/othersec/puffer/index.html |archivedate=2009-03-22 |title=AGH's Atari Project Puffer Page |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atarihq.com/5200/5200faq/03_04.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090322111519/http://www.atarihq.com/5200/5200faq/03_04.html |archivedate=2009-03-22 |title=What Was The Top-Secret \"Puffer Project\"? |url-status=dead }}</ref>  Forward speed was controlled by pedaling while steering and additional gameplay was handled by a handlebar-mounted Gamepad. The machine was nearly ready for production with several games (''Tumbleweeds'' and ''Jungle River Cruise'') when Atari declared bankruptcy and the Puffer project was abandoned. [[Nintendo]] also dabbled in this space with the [[Power Pad]], released for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] in 1986.\n\nThe first exergaming system released to the market was the 1986 ''Computrainer''. Designed as a training aid and motivational tool, the ''Computrainer'' allowed users to ride through a virtual landscape generated on an NES, while monitoring data such as power output and pedaling cadence. The product had a price that was far too high to be considered as an entertainment product, but was affordable by dedicated athletes. The product continues to this day, where it now runs using [[Microsoft Windows]] compatible software with extensive graphic and physiological capabilities.\n\nAlso released for the [[NES]] in 1986 was the [[Family Trainer]], which focused on entertainment rather than exercise.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}\n\nAbout the same time as the Computrainer, Concept II introduced a computer attachment for their rowing machine. This has become their ''eRow'' product and is used for both individual motivation as well as competition in \"indoor rowing leagues\".\n\n===1990s===\nDuring the 1990s, there was a surge of interest in the application of \"virtual reality\" technologies to high-end gym equipment. Life Fitness and Nintendo partnered to produce the ''Exertainment'' System; Precor had an LCD-based bike product, and Universal had several CRT-based systems. The Netpulse system provided users with the ability to browse the web while exercising. Fitlinxx introduced a system that used sensors attached to weight machines in order to provide automated feedback to users.\n\nThree issues combined to ensure the failure of these systems in the marketplace. First, they were significantly more expensive than the equivalent models that did not have all the additional electronics. Second, they were harder to maintain, and were often left broken. Lastly the additional expertise required to operate the software was often intimidating to the users, who shied away from the machines out of fear that they would look foolish while trying to master the machine.\n\nUntil 1998, nothing significant happened in the field of videogame exercise. Hardware was still too expensive for the average home consumer, and the health clubs were gun-shy about adopting any new technology. As high-performance game console capabilities improved and prices fell, manufacturers once more started to explore the fitness market.\n\nIn 1998, [[Konami]]'s [[Dance Dance Revolution]] was released along with [[Andamiro]]'s [[Pump It Up (video game series)]] a couple months later.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2000, UK startup [[Exertris]] introduced an interactive gaming bike to the commercial fitness market.\n\nExergaming came to the mass media attention at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] when Bill Gates showcased the [[Exertris]] Interactive Gaming Bike in 2003, and the following year the same show hosted a pavilion dedicated to video game technology that also worked as sports and [[exercise equipment]].\n\n[[Image:Gamercize GZ Sport.jpg|thumb|Gamercize played on PlayStation 2]]\nThe 2005 release of the [[EyeToy: Kinetic]] brought the first multi-function exergame hardware into the home market. Making the players physical movements into the game's controller. 2006 saw the launch of [[Gamercize]], combining traditional fitness equipment with game consoles. The minimalist approach allows game play to continue only when exercising, turning all game titles into potential exergames.\n\n[[Nintendo]]'s [[Wii]] in 2006 brought acceleration detection with the [[Wii Remote]]. In late 2007, Nintendo released the exergame [[Wii Fit]], which utilized a new peripheral, the [[Wii Balance Board]]. The popularity of the Wii lead to it being used in hospital \"Wiihab\" rehabilitation programs.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/hospitals-discover-the-power-of-wiihab/ |title=Hospitals Discover The Power Of 'Wiihab' |publisher=CBS News |date=2008-02-08 |accessdate=2015-10-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[PCGamerBike]] appeared at CES in 2007 where it received an Honoree Award. It differs from other exergaming devices in that its pedal motion can be mapped to any key on the keyboard. It also has an optical encoder which detects forward and reverse pedal motion.  The Fisher-Price Smart Cycle was another entry in the field.\n\nOther examples of exergaming products include: Positive Gaming iDANCE, iSTEP, [[Cobalt Flux]] Blufit, [[Cyber coach]], [[NeoRacer]], Gymkids exercise equipment with interactive technology, some [[Wii]] titles such as [[EA Sports Active]], [[Cybex]] TRAZER, Powergrid Fitness Kilowatt, Lightspace Play Floor, [[PlayMotion]], [[Yourself!Fitness]], Expresso Fitness S2, [[i.play]], Cyber ExerCycle, VEQTOR Sport Trainer and Sportwall.\n\n===2010s===\nThe [[Kinect]] (2010) represented a significant advance in how player motion was detected in games, because the player's body became the remote.<ref>{{cite web|first= Michael |last= Rosenberg |url= https://theconversation.com/sorry-gamers-wii-fit-is-no-substitute-for-real-exercise-22375 |title=Sorry gamers, Wii Fit is no substitute for real exercise |publisher=[[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2015-10-28}}</ref> The exergaming trend within consoles that started with the seventh generation [[Wii]] peaked with the [[Nike+ Kinect Training]] (2012) & pedometer-pairing [[Wii Fit U]] (2013) games. These were followed up in the eighth generation by a exergaming push by Microsoft with the [[Xbox One]] launch day [[Xbox Fitness]] service (2013), which tracked metrics such as heart rate and correct form while synchronising these metrics with the [[Microsoft Health]]. By 2017, [[Microsoft]] had pivoted away from [[Kinect]] and exergaming on consoles. In 2019, Nintendo released [[Fitness Boxing]], and [[Ring Fit Adventure]] for the [[Nintendo Switch]].\n\nMobile phone apps such as ''[[Zombies, Run!]]'' (2012), ''Run An Empire'',<ref>{{cite web|last1=Roberton|first1=Andy|title='Run An Empire' Is 'Pok\u00e9mon GO' With Real Health Benefits|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyrobertson/2016/08/22/pokemon-go-fitness-run-an-empire/|publisher=Forbes}}</ref> ''[[Ingress (video game)|Ingress]]'' (2013), and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]'' (2016) have been described as [[augmented reality]] exergames.<ref>{{cite book|editor-first1= Minhua |editor-last1= Ma |editor-first2= Lakhmi C. |editor-last2= Jain |editor-first3= Paul |editor-last3= Anderson |title=Virtual, augmented reality and serious games for healthcare 1| date= 2014| publisher= Springer Berlin Heidelberg|location=Berlin, Heidelberg |isbn= 9783642548161 |page= 199}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.livescience.com/55373-pokemon-go-exercise.html| title= 'Pok\u00e9mon Go' Catches High Praise from Health Experts| first= Rachael | last= Rettner| date= July 12, 2016 | website= LiveScience.com| access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref>\n\nVR, or Virtual Reality, is now starting to become a major player in the world of Exergaming.

Because it takes longer for a user to move their entire body in response to stimulation from the game, it is often the case that dedicated software must be written for the game to playable. An example of this is [[Konami]]'s ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]''. Though designed to be played by users moving about on a specially designed dancepad, that game can alternatively be played by pushing buttons with one's fingers using a standard hand-held gamepad. When played with the dancepad at higher levels the game can be quite challenging (and physically exhausting), but if the game is played using the buttons on the hand controller, none of the sequences are physically limited.\n\nNewer systems such as [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]] and Wii use alternative [[input devices]] such as the [[Kinect]] and [[PlayStation Move]]. The Move uses image analysis to extract the motion of the user against a background and uses these motions to control the character in the game.  A specifically designed exercise game ''Kinetic'', superimposes animated objects to be punched, kicked, or otherwise interacted with over a video image of the user.  The Wii and PlayStation 3 both incorporate motion sensors such as [[accelerometers]] and [[gyroscopes]] into the hand-held controllers that are used to direct behaviors within the game.\n \nResearch projects such as exertion interfaces<ref>{{cite web| first1= Florian |last1= Mueller| first2=Stefan |last2= Agamanolis| first3= Rosalind |last3= Picard| title= Exertion Interfaces: Sports over a Distance for Social Bonding and Fun| date= April 2003| url= http://affect.media.mit.edu/pdfs/03.mueller-agamanolis-picard.pdf | work= CHI '03 Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems| access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref> that investigate the design aspects of these games<ref>{{cite web| first1= Florian |last1= Mueller| first2=Martin R. |last2= Gibbs| first3= Frank |last3= Vetere| title=Design Influence on Social Play in Distributed Exertion Games| work= CHI '09 Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems| pages= 1539\u201348 |date= April 2009| url= http://exertioninterfaces.com/cms/images/stories/pdf/design_chi09.pdf| access-date= November 22, 2016}}</ref> explore how the technological augmentation that comes with the digital gameplay component can be nurtured for additional benefits, such as utilizing the social power of exercising together even though players are connected only over a network<ref>[http://exertioninterfaces.com/cms/breakout-for-two.html Breakout for Two].

He was originally a [[linotype machine|linotyper]] for the ''Daily Courier'' who became jealous of his boss's success; later, he becomes a criminal mastermind under the name Psycho-Pirate. He plans crimes based on emotions, hoping to ruin his boss. Nothing is known of the life of Charles Halstead before he became a linotyper at the ''Daily Courier''. A long-time employee, Halstead was a friend and favorite of publisher Rex Morgan. Secretly, however, Halstead was frustrated with his lack of advancement at the paper and, at some point, snapped. He resolved to take what he had never been able to earn and his first target was the paper itself. He began to stage a series of crimes based on emotions (hate, greed, etc.), cluing the ''Courier'' with leads to his crimes.\n\nAs time passed, Halstead, as the Psycho-Pirate, became bolder. He penned a letter to the ''Courier'', challenging the [[Justice Society]] to stop a new wave of crimes based on a variety of emotions. For example, he engendered fear into the inhabitants of a city where he threatened to unleash a deadly plague until his plan was halted by [[Dr. Mid-Nite]]. Each JSAer was given an emotion and a task to solve. With the JSA dispersed and only [[The Atom (Al Pratt)|the Atom]] to guard Halstead, the Psycho-Pirate began a campaign to demoralize the publisher with constant news of despair: business failure, divorce, foreclosure\u2014a series of lies designed to crush the spirit of his employer. To remove the Atom, he convinced the hero that the JSA had been captured and sent the Mighty Mite to rescue them. The Atom discovered the ruse and defeated the criminal's henchmen disguised as JSAers. In doing so, the Atom discovered the true identity of the Psycho-Pirate, who shot him to preserve his secrecy. Wounded, the Atom made it to the ''Courier'' just as the JSA returned and exposed Halstead as the Psycho-Pirate. Halstead was subsequently sentenced to a lengthy prison term after the Justice Society of America captured and put him in jail. He escaped by playing on the emotions of a guard, but the JSA heard of his plans from his cellmate and were able to recapture him. He continued to research the mysticism of emotions until his death sometime in the 1960s.\n\n===Roger Hayden===\nRoger Hayden first appeared as the second Psycho-Pirate in ''Showcase #56'', created by Gardner Fox and [[Murphy Anderson]].\n[[File:Showcase 56.jpg|thumbnail|left|The first appearance of the second '''Psycho-Pirate'''. Cover to ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #56. Art by [[Murphy Anderson]].]]\n\nRoger Hayden is a jailed gangster (later [[retcon]]ned into a young 20-year-old who was sentenced to a year in prison for attacking his emotionally abusive psychiatrist father) who is a cellmate to Halstead on [[Earth-Two]].<ref>Earth-Two was established as a parallel world that served as the home of the [[Justice Society of America]], as well as other DC Comics characters introduced during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. ''Flash'' (vol. 1) #123 (September 1961).</ref>  Halstead's dying wish, to have a legacy, prompts him to tell Hayden of a secret which he has divined in his jail years: the existence of the Medusa Masks. These golden masks bestow upon the wearer the power to project emotions onto others. Hayden finds these masks, merges them into a single faceplate and uses its powers to become a supervillain. It becomes increasingly apparent that he is addicted to absorbing others' emotions, though it causes him pain, possibly brought on by the combination of all of the masks into one. He is eventually imprisoned after a battle with  [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Hourman]].\n\nHayden returns to prominence when he insidiously begins influencing prominent [[Gotham City]] citizens [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Alan Scott]]; Wayne is a former wealthy businessman and now commissioner of Gotham's police force and Scott is the president of the television station WXYZ. Initially, Scott is the most affected by Psycho Pirate as he, in his Green Lantern persona, begins exercising his frustrations upon humanity for the failures of his private life, such as the impending bankruptcy of his station. After creating a disturbance at Gotham International Airport, he is subdued by his [[Justice Society]] comrades, who assist both Scott and teammate [[Jay Garrick|Flash]], who had also been under Hayden's control. The Society has to next battle a civil war within their membership instigated by Wayne, still under Hayden's control and determined to rid Gotham of all superheroes.\n\nHayden later joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], having been recruited by the [[Ultra-Humanite]] to defeat Hayden's old foe Hourman. While he is initially successful thanks to a device the Ultra-Humanite devises that amplifies and projects Hayden's face and hence his control, ultimately both the Justice Society and the [[Justice League]] defeat Hayden and his teammates after their betrayal of fellow Secret Society members. The villains are deposited into an interdimensional rift known as [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]].\n\nWhile in Limbo, the Ultra-Humanite gains mental contact with his younger self from the 1940s and the two {{not a typo|Ultra-Human|ites}} are able to pull the Secret Society, including Hayden, back to that era, where they confront and are defeated by the [[All-Star Squadron]] and the time-lost [[Infinity Inc.]]\n\n====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====\nIn the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] recruits Hayden\u2014who goes on to help [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] recruit his enemy [[Killer Frost]] to the Monitor's team by making her fall in love with Firestorm\u2014but Hayden is quickly abducted by the [[Anti-Monitor]]. In exchange for an entire world and all of its inhabitants' emotions to play with, Psycho-Pirate becomes an accomplice to the Anti-Monitor, manipulating a captive [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. The Flash's powers are briefly enhanced so that Hayden can control the remaining three alternate Earths at the time (Earth-4, Earth-S, and Earth-X) so that their heroes are provoked into attacking teams sent to rescue them. Psycho Pirate's use of his powers on this scale causes him to \"burn out\" so that he cannot use his powers again afterward. Although the Anti-Monitor constantly belittles the Psycho-Pirate, he keeps him around in case his emotion-manipulating abilities prove useful later on and because he lacks the time to find or create someone else with the same powers. After the resolution of the Crisis, Psycho-Pirate is one of very few individuals to have full memories of the event. Driven mad by these memories, the Psycho-Pirate is shown in the last few panels of 'Crisis' in a straitjacket.\n\n====Post-''Crisis''====\nFollowing the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Hayden escapes Arkham Asylum and encounters a renegade 5th Dimension Thunderbolt genie who has merged with private investigator Jonnie Thunder. In the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #30-34, the two bedevil the members of Infinity, Inc. in a bid to destroy Jonnie's mind so that the Thunderbolt can seize total control over her body. During the arc it is shown that the renegade Thunderbolt repeatedly electroshocked Psycho-Pirate upon recruiting him. Although this was done to \"cure\" Hayden of the madness he was suffering from, the electroshock had the side effect of making Psycho Pirate loses all memories of the ''Crisis'' and the existence of parallel Earths.\n\nDefeated, Hayden relocates to Markovia and impersonates the villain [[Baron Bedlam]] in order to gain power in the nation. In a story that spanned two specials (''Outsiders Special'' and ''Infinity, Inc. Special''), the Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. defeat and imprison Psycho-Pirate.\n\nHayden shows up again in [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on ''[[Animal Man]]'', imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]]. The effects of the electroshocks given to him by the renegade Thunderbolt have worn off and Hayden's memories of the ''Crisis'' and of the prior existence of multiple Earths are restored. Psycho Pirate ends up releasing characters destroyed during the ''Crisis'' back into the world, although many of these characters later come to realize they are just characters in a comic book. After an intervention by Animal Man, Hayden, seemingly happy, fades away into nothingness. Psycho Pirate's happiness is due to a relief of the strain from releasing all of the forgotten characters, but he is consequently removed from reality and placed back in [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]]. James Highwater, one of the Asylum staff, is left to wear the Medusa Mask and keep the forgotten Earths contained. The other staff members come to accept Highwater as a patient, not realizing his knowledge of the missing worlds.\n\nAt some point, the Medusa Mask is held by the [[Force of July]]. Abraham Lincoln Carlyle, who shelters the Force, claims to have gotten the mask from Hayden and to have learned how to use it by watching him. He tries to use the mask, unsuccessfully, against [[Shade, the Changing Man]] as his team falls under attack from the [[Suicide Squad]]; Carlyle's heart fails him, however, and he dies.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #27, 1989</ref>\n\nPsycho-Pirate does not appear again until 1995 when he became part of the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event. In this story Psycho-Pirate, along with several other villians, sells his soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for more power. The process results in a costume change for the character as well, with Hayden now wearing a black leather jacket and with the metal of his mask morphing into an eyepatch and replacing about half of his brain. Once again sane, and making no allusion to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and the existence of the Multiverse, Psycho-Pirate goes on to fight the Chase Lawler version of [[Manhunter (comics)#Chase Lawler|Manhunter]] before being arrested and sent to jail.\n\nAfter his appearance in the ''Fate'' series, Psycho-Pirate makes two brief appearances during the ''Joker: Last Laugh'' crossover event. He is first seen locked up in the maximum security prison called the \"Slab\", where he is again insane and rambling of the existence of the Multiverse and is seen in his original costume. All but one eye of the Pirate's face is covered and his eyebrows have been shaved off to reduce his ability to express emotion. The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] initiates a breakout and infection of the inmates, causing them to follow his orders and commit dangerous pranks. Because of this control, Psycho Pirate is seen shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre during the breakout.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nPsycho-Pirate reappears in the ''JSA Classified'' #1\u20134 story arc, in which he reveals that he and Power Girl are refugees from Earth-Two. Along with several other individuals (such as [[Donna Troy]] and her evil alter ego Dark Angel), both Psycho Pirate and Power Girl were \"missed\" in the restructuring of the Multiverse into a single universe following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths.'' This revelation restores the original origin story of Power Girl as well.\n[[File:Deathpp.PNG|200px|left|Psycho-Pirate's death at the hands of [[Black Adam]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|thumb]]\nPsycho-Pirate hopes to weaken Power Girl mentally so that she can be captured as part of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s plot to unite and control characters who had originally been from universes destroyed during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Failing at this, Psycho-Pirate flees and vows to make Power Girl his love slave once Luthor is finished with her.\n\nWhen [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and [[Wonder Girl]] attack Luthor's base, they free all the captive heroes, including Power Girl and [[Black Adam]], who are then confronted by the Psycho-Pirate. Black Adam proceeds to gouge out the Psycho-Pirate's eyes and pushes the Medusa Mask through his head, killing him.\n\nPsycho-Pirate is mentioned in ''Justice League of America'' #1 as selling emotional states, such as \"happy\" and \"ecstatic\", much like a drug dealer. Among his reported clients are [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] and Silver Ghost. Psycho-Pirate's Medusa Mask is also featured in the 2008 ''[[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'' miniseries. In the story's conclusion, Raven destroyed the mask but its power still affected scientists who studied its schematics on a computer.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Psycho-Pirate has been identified as one of the deceased who are entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref> Psycho-Pirate's corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)</ref> He attacks Smallville, using his powers to manipulate the inhabitants and sway [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] into attacking Superman. Psycho-Pirate murders several Smallville citizens after using his powers to enhance their emotions, as Black Lanterns enjoy attacking the emotionally overwrought.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #2 (2009)</ref>\n\nConner attacks Superman and aids the Black Lantern [[Kal-L|Superman from Earth 2]], however the effect of the mask wears off and Conner once more regains his senses. Clark and Conner decide to separate, with Conner confronting Psycho-Pirate. Conner manages to withstand his emotional manipulation attempts and steals the Medusa Mask, which has been reconstructed via the black ring. Using the artifact, Conner inspires hope, will, and compassion, ending the riots in Smallville. Psycho-Pirate is last seen retreating into a dark alley, followed by Conner. Conner then uses the Medusa Mask on Kal-L, causing the black rings to malfunction and turning both Psycho-Pirate and Kal-L back into inanimate corpses.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new Psycho-Pirate first appears in ''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23 as a member of the Twenty, a group of people who are infected by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] with a psionic virus, thus giving them all psionic abilities. He was captured by the [[H.I.V.E.]] Queen, another member of the Twenty who had become a zealous devotee of Brainiac. He managed to escape and sought out the Medusa Mask, an artifact that he believed would protect him against other people with psychic powers. He then spent the next four years hiding other psychics from H.I.V.E. who were using the people they captured to power their operations in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 3 #24</ref>\n\nDuring the Psi-War storyline, the Psycho-Pirate appears and takes out [[Hector Hammond]] and the H.I.V.E. Queen, who were both fighting for control of the city. When [[Superman]] arrives at H.I.V.E.'s headquarters, Hayden confronts him and drains his mind too. He is then surprised by [[Lois Lane]], who was infected with the same psionic virus by Senator Hume, yet another member of the Twenty. The two fight, with Hayden getting the upper hand. He then proceeds to make Metropolis' citizens act on pure emotion, creating riots and chaos throughout the streets. A recovered Superman, Lois Lane, Hector Hammond, and the H.I.V.E. Queen then team up to fight the Pirate and a fierce battle ensues, during which the Queen and Hammond are beaten. Superman manages to pull the Medusa Mask off of Hayden's face and incinerates it with his heat vision, defeating the Psycho-Pirate. However, he disappears in the aftermath of the battle.<ref>''Superman'' Vol. 3 #23-24</ref>\n\nAt the same time as he was clashing with Superman, Roger Hayden also sent an astral projection to confront [[Superboy]] and [[Doctor Psycho]] who are in [[New York City]] looking for a psychic called Shift. He reveals that Psycho was only manipulating Superboy to get his power. A three-way battle ensues between the three characters, which ends with Doctor Psycho being defeated and Superboy falling unconscious, only to wake up in a cell powerless.<ref>''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23-24</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nPsycho-Pirate and [[Hugo Strange]] are sent to [[Gotham City|Gotham]] as part of [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Task Force X]]. As soon as they arrive, Hugo Strange deviates from their mission and uses Psycho-Pirate to infect Gotham City's newest heroes, Gotham and Gotham Girl, with overwhelming rage and fear, respectively, causing Gotham to go on a murderous rampage. With this accomplished, Strange trades the Psycho-Pirate to [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], who wants the Pirate to help him overcome the horrors of his childhood and his addiction to Venom. When [[Batman]] learns of this, he forms his own Suicide Squad with the [[Bronze Tiger]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Punch and Jewelee]]. Together, they infiltrate Bane's prison fortress on the island of [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]] and retrieve the Psycho-Pirate. Batman returns the Pirate to Gotham City and uses him to reverse the emotional damage that he did to Gotham Girl.<ref>''Batman'' (2016-) Vol. #1-3</ref>\n\nThe Medusa Mask is taken into Batman's custody. When Batman accidentally puts the blood-stained smiley face button from the corpse of Edward Blake (the Comedian) left in Batman's Batcave by Dr. Manhattan, next to the Medusa Mask, both artifacts create an energy reaction that attracts the attention of the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).]] The Reverse Flash is then killed by Dr. Manhattan, but not before the Medusa Mask manifests the erased-from-existence [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]; who frantically attempts to warn Batman and Flash of Manhattan's evil scheme to alter the timeline so as to eliminate the Justice League and a create a darker, more cynical Superman, and a version of the Flashpoint Universe Thomas Wayne, who begs Batman to give up his costumed identity for a normal existence.<ref>''Batman'' #20-21 and ''Flash'' #20-21</ref>\n\nShortly after those events, Hayden has the Medusa Mask returned to him by agents of Bane. From there, it is revealed in the wake of the aborted Batman and Catwoman wedding that Hugo Strange, Psycho-Pirate and Gotham Girl were actually working together in secret with Bane, and that Psycho-Pirate has resurrected the ''Flashpoint'' Batman from the dead, to aid in Bane's scheme.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCharles Halstead has no superhuman powers; he is, however, a brilliant criminal mind with an excellent grasp of human psychology and emotions.\n\nWith the Medusa Mask, Roger Hayden is able to project emotions into people. Often, it seems to intensify emotions that a person already feels, no matter how small. Hayden later shows the power to manifest DC Multiverse characters that had been destroyed during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. This power expands to any Multiverse character, including the still-living. Psycho-Pirate has also shown some sort of regeneration of body control, as he is able to reform after being crushed by Power Girl, and also disguises himself as a Legion flight ring.\n\nDuring his '90s revamp, Psycho-Pirate was an \"psychic vampire\", able to drain emotions from people.\n\nFollowing the ''New 52'' reboot, Roger Hayden is depicted as a psychic who specializes in telepathically manipulating people's emotions. Examples include: calming a person to make them more reasonable or amplifying negative emotions such as fear or anger to the point of sending people into a murderous frenzy. While wearing the Medusa Mask, Hayden's emotion-manipulating powers were increased to the point where he could control all of Metropolis without straining himself. The mask also provided him with a number of other abilities, including shielding his mind against intrusion from other telepaths; levitation; draining other psi-powered individuals of their mental energies to increase his own; projecting psionic constructs in the form of giant orange snakes which he used to attack; forming a psychic link with another person; projecting his mind over tremendous distances, essentially granting him omnipresence; deflecting psionic attacks; projecting bolts of psionic energy; and creating illusions.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate makes a cameo appearance as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He has no lines and takes no significant action in any episode. Notably, he is lacking the Medusa Mask.\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]. In the episode \"Inside the Outsiders\", he is a sadist who kidnaps the group of teenage heroes known as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] ([[Black Lightning]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and [[Metamorpho]]) and feeds off their rage caused by twisted nightmares. Batman goes inside their minds to save them, but Psycho-Pirate fakes his victory, almost causing Batman to feed him rage by pretending to kill the Outsiders. Batman realizes this, and thinks positive thoughts, starving the villain, and defeating him. Psycho-Pirate also made a cameo appearance in \"Mayhem of the Music Meister\" in the musical number \"Drives Us Bats\", as one of the patients at Arkham Asylum mesmerized into singing by the [[Music Meister]].\n* In the ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'' episode \"Blessed are the Damned\", the Medusa Mask is briefly seen among the artifacts stored in Jasper Winter's house.\n* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Nora\", [[Nora West-Allen]] reveals a newspaper from 2049 to her father, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] about his disappearance in 2024. The newspaper includes a quote from Roger Hayden a.k.a. Psycho-Pirate, who claims to remember the events of the Flash's final battle with the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and Flash's disappearance, who says, \"Worlds lived, worlds died. Nothing will ever be the same.\"\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate made his live action debut in the DCTV crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", portrayed by [[Bob Frazer]].<ref name=\"Frazer\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |title=Arrowverse 'Elseworlds' crossover to feature DC villain Psycho-Pirate |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 2, 2018 |accessdate=November 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102211618/https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |archivedate=November 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the second part of the crossover, Hayden is part of a group of inmates attempting to escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] after being released by [[Doctor Destiny|John Deegan]] before being stopped by [[Batwoman]]. In the final part, he reappears in his cell with his signature mask with a disfigured Deegan as his neighbor, cryptically quoting, \"Worlds will live, worlds will die and the universe [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|will never be the same]].\"\n\n===Video games===\n*The Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Armin Shimerman reprising the role from the ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' series.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* In the ''Justice League Adventures'' Issue #20 story \"Emotional Baggage\", Roger Hayden is a former psychiatrist (suspended for malpractice) whose wife and son died during an alien attack in Metropolis that the Justice League was involved in. He blames the League for this, displacing his own guilt. To exact revenge, he steals the Medusa Mask and becomes the Psycho-Pirate, first turning civilians against the League and then using the members' deeply hidden resentments to turn them against each other. By shape-shifting the emotion centers of his brain, Martian Manhunter frees himself and stops the Pirate's rampage by going into Hayden's memories of his family. Hayden is later seen in a straitjacket after this; doctors believe that the Medusa Mask has driven him insane. However, the \"horrors\" they say he is experiencing in his mind turn out to be him telling his wife and son that he loves them.\n* Psycho-Pirate appears as the primary antagonist of a special one-shot ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' issue published for [[Free Comic Book Day]]. He is shown working with [[Atomic Skull]] as part of a scheme to steal [[plutonium]] from a [[STAR Labs]] facility. Psycho-Pirate uses his Medusa Mask to force [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], [[Robin (Dick Grayson)|Robin]], and [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]] to confront their inner demons, but is defeated and captured when Kid Flash breaks out of the illusion and removes the Medusa Mask from Psycho-Pirate's face.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/193 Fanpage about the Psycho-Pirate (both Halstead and Hayden)]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Solomon Grundy was debuted by Alfred Bester and Paul Reinman.

He plans crimes based on emotions, hoping to ruin his boss. Nothing is known of the life of Charles Halstead before he became a linotyper at the ''Daily Courier''.

He penned a letter to the ''Courier'', challenging the [[Justice Society]] to stop a new wave of crimes based on a variety of emotions. For example, he engendered fear into the inhabitants of a city where he threatened to unleash a deadly plague until his plan was halted by [[Dr. Mid-Nite]]. Each JSAer was given an emotion and a task to solve. With the JSA dispersed and only [[The Atom (Al Pratt)|the Atom]] to guard Halstead, the Psycho-Pirate began a campaign to demoralize the publisher with constant news of despair: business failure, divorce, foreclosure\u2014a series of lies designed to crush the spirit of his employer. To remove the Atom, he convinced the hero that the JSA had been captured and sent the Mighty Mite to rescue them. The Atom discovered the ruse and defeated the criminal's henchmen disguised as JSAers. In doing so, the Atom discovered the true identity of the Psycho-Pirate, who shot him to preserve his secrecy. Wounded, the Atom made it to the ''Courier'' just as the JSA returned and exposed Halstead as the Psycho-Pirate. Halstead was subsequently sentenced to a lengthy prison term after the Justice Society of America captured and put him in jail. He escaped by playing on the emotions of a guard, but the JSA heard of his plans from his cellmate and were able to recapture him. He continued to research the mysticism of emotions until his death sometime in the 1960s.\n\n===Roger Hayden===\nRoger Hayden first appeared as the second Psycho-Pirate in ''Showcase #56'', created by Gardner Fox and [[Murphy Anderson]].\n[[File:Showcase 56.jpg|thumbnail|left|The first appearance of the second '''Psycho-Pirate'''. Cover to ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #56. Art by [[Murphy Anderson]].]]\n\nRoger Hayden is a jailed gangster (later [[retcon]]ned into a young 20-year-old who was sentenced to a year in prison for attacking his emotionally abusive psychiatrist father) who is a cellmate to Halstead on [[Earth-Two]].<ref>Earth-Two was established as a parallel world that served as the home of the [[Justice Society of America]], as well as other DC Comics characters introduced during the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]]. ''Flash'' (vol. 1) #123 (September 1961).</ref>  Halstead's dying wish, to have a legacy, prompts him to tell Hayden of a secret which he has divined in his jail years: the existence of the Medusa Masks. These golden masks bestow upon the wearer the power to project emotions onto others. Hayden finds these masks, merges them into a single faceplate and uses its powers to become a supervillain. It becomes increasingly apparent that he is addicted to absorbing others' emotions, though it causes him pain, possibly brought on by the combination of all of the masks into one. He is eventually imprisoned after a battle with  [[Doctor Fate]] and [[Hourman]].\n\nHayden returns to prominence when he insidiously begins influencing prominent [[Gotham City]] citizens [[Bruce Wayne]] and [[Alan Scott]]; Wayne is a former wealthy businessman and now commissioner of Gotham's police force and Scott is the president of the television station WXYZ. Initially, Scott is the most affected by Psycho Pirate as he, in his Green Lantern persona, begins exercising his frustrations upon humanity for the failures of his private life, such as the impending bankruptcy of his station. After creating a disturbance at Gotham International Airport, he is subdued by his [[Justice Society]] comrades, who assist both Scott and teammate [[Jay Garrick|Flash]], who had also been under Hayden's control. The Society has to next battle a civil war within their membership instigated by Wayne, still under Hayden's control and determined to rid Gotham of all superheroes.\n\nHayden later joins the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]], having been recruited by the [[Ultra-Humanite]] to defeat Hayden's old foe Hourman. While he is initially successful thanks to a device the Ultra-Humanite devises that amplifies and projects Hayden's face and hence his control, ultimately both the Justice Society and the [[Justice League]] defeat Hayden and his teammates after their betrayal of fellow Secret Society members. The villains are deposited into an interdimensional rift known as [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]].\n\nWhile in Limbo, the Ultra-Humanite gains mental contact with his younger self from the 1940s and the two {{not a typo|Ultra-Human|ites}} are able to pull the Secret Society, including Hayden, back to that era, where they confront and are defeated by the [[All-Star Squadron]] and the time-lost [[Infinity Inc.]]\n\n====''Crisis on Infinite Earths''====\nIn the ''[[Crisis on Infinite Earths]]'' [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]], the [[Monitor (comics)|Monitor]] recruits Hayden\u2014who goes on to help [[Firestorm (comics)|Firestorm]] recruit his enemy [[Killer Frost]] to the Monitor's team by making her fall in love with Firestorm\u2014but Hayden is quickly abducted by the [[Anti-Monitor]]. In exchange for an entire world and all of its inhabitants' emotions to play with, Psycho-Pirate becomes an accomplice to the Anti-Monitor, manipulating a captive [[Flash (Barry Allen)|Barry Allen]]. The Flash's powers are briefly enhanced so that Hayden can control the remaining three alternate Earths at the time (Earth-4, Earth-S, and Earth-X) so that their heroes are provoked into attacking teams sent to rescue them. Psycho Pirate's use of his powers on this scale causes him to \"burn out\" so that he cannot use his powers again afterward. Although the Anti-Monitor constantly belittles the Psycho-Pirate, he keeps him around in case his emotion-manipulating abilities prove useful later on and because he lacks the time to find or create someone else with the same powers. After the resolution of the Crisis, Psycho-Pirate is one of very few individuals to have full memories of the event. Driven mad by these memories, the Psycho-Pirate is shown in the last few panels of 'Crisis' in a straitjacket.\n\n====Post-''Crisis''====\nFollowing the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'', Hayden escapes Arkham Asylum and encounters a renegade 5th Dimension Thunderbolt genie who has merged with private investigator Jonnie Thunder. In the pages of ''Infinity, Inc.'' #30-34, the two bedevil the members of Infinity, Inc. in a bid to destroy Jonnie's mind so that the Thunderbolt can seize total control over her body. During the arc it is shown that the renegade Thunderbolt repeatedly electroshocked Psycho-Pirate upon recruiting him. Although this was done to \"cure\" Hayden of the madness he was suffering from, the electroshock had the side effect of making Psycho Pirate loses all memories of the ''Crisis'' and the existence of parallel Earths.\n\nDefeated, Hayden relocates to Markovia and impersonates the villain [[Baron Bedlam]] in order to gain power in the nation. In a story that spanned two specials (''Outsiders Special'' and ''Infinity, Inc. Special''), the Outsiders and Infinity, Inc. defeat and imprison Psycho-Pirate.\n\nHayden shows up again in [[Grant Morrison]]'s run on ''[[Animal Man]]'', imprisoned in [[Arkham Asylum]]. The effects of the electroshocks given to him by the renegade Thunderbolt have worn off and Hayden's memories of the ''Crisis'' and of the prior existence of multiple Earths are restored. Psycho Pirate ends up releasing characters destroyed during the ''Crisis'' back into the world, although many of these characters later come to realize they are just characters in a comic book. After an intervention by Animal Man, Hayden, seemingly happy, fades away into nothingness. Psycho Pirate's happiness is due to a relief of the strain from releasing all of the forgotten characters, but he is consequently removed from reality and placed back in [[Limbo (DC Comics)|Limbo]]. James Highwater, one of the Asylum staff, is left to wear the Medusa Mask and keep the forgotten Earths contained. The other staff members come to accept Highwater as a patient, not realizing his knowledge of the missing worlds.\n\nAt some point, the Medusa Mask is held by the [[Force of July]]. Abraham Lincoln Carlyle, who shelters the Force, claims to have gotten the mask from Hayden and to have learned how to use it by watching him. He tries to use the mask, unsuccessfully, against [[Shade, the Changing Man]] as his team falls under attack from the [[Suicide Squad]]; Carlyle's heart fails him, however, and he dies.<ref>''Suicide Squad'' #27, 1989</ref>\n\nPsycho-Pirate does not appear again until 1995 when he became part of the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' crossover event. In this story Psycho-Pirate, along with several other villians, sells his soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for more power. The process results in a costume change for the character as well, with Hayden now wearing a black leather jacket and with the metal of his mask morphing into an eyepatch and replacing about half of his brain. Once again sane, and making no allusion to the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths'' and the existence of the Multiverse, Psycho-Pirate goes on to fight the Chase Lawler version of [[Manhunter (comics)#Chase Lawler|Manhunter]] before being arrested and sent to jail.\n\nAfter his appearance in the ''Fate'' series, Psycho-Pirate makes two brief appearances during the ''Joker: Last Laugh'' crossover event. He is first seen locked up in the maximum security prison called the \"Slab\". Psycho Pirate is again insane and rambling of the existence of the Multiverse and is seen in his original costume. All but one eye of the Pirate's face is covered and his eyebrows have been shaved off to reduce his ability to express emotion. The [[Joker (character)|Joker]] initiates a breakout and infection of the inmates, causing them to follow his orders and commit dangerous pranks. Psycho Pirate is seen shouting \"Fire!\" in a crowded theatre during the breakout.\n\n====''Infinite Crisis''====\n{{Main|Infinite Crisis}}\nPsycho-Pirate reappears in the ''JSA Classified'' #1\u20134 story arc, in which he reveals that he and Power Girl are refugees from Earth-Two. Along with several other individuals (such as [[Donna Troy]] and her evil alter ego Dark Angel), both Psycho Pirate and Power Girl were \"missed\" in the restructuring of the Multiverse into a single universe following the events of ''Crisis on Infinite Earths.'' This revelation restores the original origin story of Power Girl as well.\n[[File:Deathpp.PNG|200px|left|Psycho-Pirate's death at the hands of [[Black Adam]]. Art by [[Phil Jimenez]].|thumb]]\nPsycho-Pirate hopes to weaken Power Girl mentally so that she can be captured as part of [[Alexander Luthor, Jr.]]'s plot to unite and control characters who had originally been from universes destroyed during ''Crisis on Infinite Earths''. Failing at this, Psycho-Pirate flees and vows to make Power Girl his love slave once Luthor is finished with her.\n\nWhen [[Dick Grayson|Nightwing]], [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], and [[Wonder Girl]] attack Luthor's base, they free all the captive heroes, including Power Girl and [[Black Adam]], who are then confronted by the Psycho-Pirate. Black Adam proceeds to gouge out the Psycho-Pirate's eyes and pushes the Medusa Mask through his head, killing him.\n\nPsycho-Pirate is mentioned in ''Justice League of America'' #1 as selling emotional states, such as \"happy\" and \"ecstatic\", much like a drug dealer. Among his reported clients are [[Signalman (comics)|Signalman]] and Silver Ghost. Psycho-Pirate's Medusa Mask is also featured in the 2008 ''[[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]]'' miniseries. In the story's conclusion, Raven destroyed the mask but its power still affected scientists who studied its schematics on a computer.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\nIn the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Psycho-Pirate has been identified as one of the deceased who are entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]].<ref>''Blackest Night'' #1 (July 2009)</ref> Psycho-Pirate's corpse is revived as a [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lantern]] during the event.<ref>''Blackest Night'' #3 (September 2009)</ref> He attacks Smallville, using his powers to manipulate the inhabitants and sway [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Conner Kent]] into attacking Superman. Psycho-Pirate murders several Smallville citizens after using his powers to enhance their emotions, as Black Lanterns enjoy attacking the emotionally overwrought.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #2 (2009)</ref>\n\nConner attacks Superman and aids the Black Lantern [[Kal-L|Superman from Earth 2]], however the effect of the mask wears off and Conner once more regains his senses. Clark and Conner decide to separate, with Conner confronting Psycho-Pirate. Conner manages to withstand his emotional manipulation attempts and steals the Medusa Mask, which has been reconstructed via the black ring. Using the artifact, Conner inspires hope, will, and compassion, ending the riots in Smallville. Psycho-Pirate is last seen retreating into a dark alley, followed by Conner. Conner then uses the Medusa Mask on Kal-L, causing the black rings to malfunction and turning both Psycho-Pirate and Kal-L back into inanimate corpses.<ref>''Blackest Night: Superman'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''The New 52''===\nIn September 2011, ''[[The New 52]]'' rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a new Psycho-Pirate first appears in ''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23 as a member of the Twenty, a group of people who are infected by [[Brainiac (character)|Brainiac]] with a psionic virus, thus giving them all psionic abilities. He was captured by the [[H.I.V.E.]] Queen, another member of the Twenty who had become a zealous devotee of Brainiac. He managed to escape and sought out the Medusa Mask, an artifact that he believed would protect him against other people with psychic powers. He then spent the next four years hiding other psychics from H.I.V.E. who were using the people they captured to power their operations in [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]].<ref>''Action Comics'' Vol. 3 #24</ref>\n\nDuring the Psi-War storyline, the Psycho-Pirate appears and takes out [[Hector Hammond]] and the H.I.V.E. Queen, who were both fighting for control of the city. When [[Superman]] arrives at H.I.V.E.'s headquarters, Hayden confronts him and drains his mind too. He is then surprised by [[Lois Lane]], who was infected with the same psionic virus by Senator Hume, yet another member of the Twenty. The two fight, with Hayden getting the upper hand. He then proceeds to make Metropolis' citizens act on pure emotion, creating riots and chaos throughout the streets. A recovered Superman, Lois Lane, Hector Hammond, and the H.I.V.E. Queen then team up to fight the Pirate and a fierce battle ensues, during which the Queen and Hammond are beaten. Superman manages to pull the Medusa Mask off of Hayden's face and incinerates it with his heat vision, defeating the Psycho-Pirate. However, he disappears in the aftermath of the battle.<ref>''Superman'' Vol. 3 #23-24</ref>\n\nAt the same time as he was clashing with Superman, Roger Hayden also sent an astral projection to confront [[Superboy]] and [[Doctor Psycho]] who are in [[New York City]] looking for a psychic called Shift. He reveals that Psycho was only manipulating Superboy to get his power. A three-way battle ensues between the three characters, which ends with Doctor Psycho being defeated and Superboy falling unconscious, only to wake up in a cell powerless.<ref>''Superboy'' Vol. 6 #23-24</ref>\n\n===''DC Rebirth''===\nPsycho-Pirate and [[Hugo Strange]] are sent to [[Gotham City|Gotham]] as part of [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Task Force X]]. As soon as they arrive, Hugo Strange deviates from their mission and uses Psycho-Pirate to infect Gotham City's newest heroes, Gotham and Gotham Girl, with overwhelming rage and fear, respectively, causing Gotham to go on a murderous rampage. With this accomplished, Strange trades the Psycho-Pirate to [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]], who wants the Pirate to help him overcome the horrors of his childhood and his addiction to Venom. When [[Batman]] learns of this, he forms his own Suicide Squad with the [[Bronze Tiger]], the [[Ventriloquist (comics)|Ventriloquist]], [[Catwoman]], and [[Punch and Jewelee]]. Together, they infiltrate Bane's prison fortress on the island of [[Santa Prisca (DC Comics)|Santa Prisca]] and retrieve the Psycho-Pirate. Batman returns the Pirate to Gotham City and uses him to reverse the emotional damage that he did to Gotham Girl.<ref>''Batman'' (2016-) Vol. #1-3</ref>\n\nThe Medusa Mask is taken into Batman's custody. When Batman accidentally puts the blood-stained smiley face button from the corpse of Edward Blake (the Comedian) left in Batman's Batcave by Dr. Manhattan, next to the Medusa Mask, both artifacts create an energy reaction that attracts the attention of the [[Eobard Thawne|Reverse Flash (Eobard Thawne).]] The Reverse Flash is then killed by Dr. Manhattan, but not before the Medusa Mask manifests the erased-from-existence [[Flash (Jay Garrick)|Jay Garrick]]; who frantically attempts to warn Batman and Flash of Manhattan's evil scheme to alter the timeline so as to eliminate the Justice League and a create a darker, more cynical Superman, and a version of the Flashpoint Universe Thomas Wayne, who begs Batman to give up his costumed identity for a normal existence.<ref>''Batman'' #20-21 and ''Flash'' #20-21</ref>\n\nShortly after those events, Hayden has the Medusa Mask returned to him by agents of Bane. From there, it is revealed in the wake of the aborted Batman and Catwoman wedding that Hugo Strange, Psycho-Pirate and Gotham Girl were actually working together in secret with Bane, and that Psycho-Pirate has resurrected the ''Flashpoint'' Batman from the dead, to aid in Bane's scheme.\n\n==Powers and abilities==\nCharles Halstead has no superhuman powers; he is, however, a brilliant criminal mind with an excellent grasp of human psychology and emotions.\n\nWith the Medusa Mask, Roger Hayden is able to project emotions into people. Often, it seems to intensify emotions that a person already feels, no matter how small. Hayden later shows the power to manifest DC Multiverse characters that had been destroyed during the Crisis on Infinite Earths. This power expands to any Multiverse character, including the still-living. Psycho-Pirate has also shown some sort of regeneration of body control, as he is able to reform after being crushed by Power Girl, and also disguises himself as a Legion flight ring.\n\nDuring his '90s revamp, Psycho-Pirate was an \"psychic vampire\", able to drain emotions from people.\n\nFollowing the ''New 52'' reboot, Roger Hayden is depicted as a psychic who specializes in telepathically manipulating people's emotions. Examples include: calming a person to make them more reasonable or amplifying negative emotions such as fear or anger to the point of sending people into a murderous frenzy. While wearing the Medusa Mask, Hayden's emotion-manipulating powers were increased to the point where he could control all of Metropolis without straining himself. The mask also provided him with a number of other abilities, including shielding his mind against intrusion from other telepaths; levitation; draining other psi-powered individuals of their mental energies to increase his own; projecting psionic constructs in the form of giant orange snakes which he used to attack; forming a psychic link with another person; projecting his mind over tremendous distances, essentially granting him omnipresence; deflecting psionic attacks; projecting bolts of psionic energy; and creating illusions.\n\n==In other media==\n===Television===\n* In ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', the Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate makes a cameo appearance as a member of [[Gorilla Grodd]]'s [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Secret Society]]. He has no lines and takes no significant action in any episode. Notably, he is lacking the Medusa Mask.\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', voiced by [[Armin Shimerman]]. In the episode \"Inside the Outsiders\", he is a sadist who kidnaps the group of teenage heroes known as the [[Outsiders (comics)|Outsiders]] ([[Black Lightning]], [[Katana (comics)|Katana]] and [[Metamorpho]]) and feeds off their rage caused by twisted nightmares. Batman goes inside their minds to save them, but Psycho-Pirate fakes his victory, almost causing Batman to feed him rage by pretending to kill the Outsiders. Batman realizes this, and thinks positive thoughts, starving the villain, and defeating him. Psycho-Pirate also made a cameo appearance in \"Mayhem of the Music Meister\" in the musical number \"Drives Us Bats\", as one of the patients at Arkham Asylum mesmerized into singing by the [[Music Meister]].\n* In the ''[[Constantine (TV series)|Constantine]]'' episode \"Blessed are the Damned\", the Medusa Mask is briefly seen among the artifacts stored in Jasper Winter's house.\n* In ''[[The Flash (2014 TV series)|The Flash]]'' episode \"Nora\", [[Nora West-Allen]] reveals a newspaper from 2049 to her father, [[Barry Allen (Arrowverse)|Barry Allen]] about his disappearance in 2024. The newspaper includes a quote from Roger Hayden a.k.a. Psycho-Pirate, who claims to remember the events of the Flash's final battle with the [[Eobard Thawne (Arrowverse)|Reverse-Flash]] and Flash's disappearance, who says, \"Worlds lived, worlds died. Nothing will ever be the same.\"\n* The Roger Hayden incarnation of Psycho-Pirate made his live action debut in the DCTV crossover \"[[Elseworlds (Arrowverse)|Elseworlds]]\", portrayed by [[Bob Frazer]].<ref name=\"Frazer\">{{cite web |url=https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |title=Arrowverse 'Elseworlds' crossover to feature DC villain Psycho-Pirate |last=Agard |first=Chancellor |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=November 2, 2018 |accessdate=November 2, 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102211618/https://ew.com/tv/2018/11/02/arrowverse-elseworlds-crossover-psycho-pirate/ |archivedate=November 2, 2018 |url-status=live}}</ref> In the second part of the crossover, Hayden is part of a group of inmates attempting to escape from [[Arkham Asylum]] after being released by [[Doctor Destiny|John Deegan]] before being stopped by [[Batwoman]]. In the final part, he reappears in his cell with his signature mask with a disfigured Deegan as his neighbor, cryptically quoting, \"Worlds will live, worlds will die and the universe [[Crisis on Infinite Earths|will never be the same]].\"\n\n===Video games===\n*The Roger Hayden version of Psycho-Pirate appears as a playable character in ''[[Lego DC Super-Villains]]'', with Armin Shimerman reprising the role from the ''Batman: The Brave and the Bold'' series.\n\n===Miscellaneous===\n* In the ''Justice League Adventures'' Issue #20 story \"Emotional Baggage\", Roger Hayden is a former psychiatrist (suspended for malpractice) whose wife and son died during an alien attack in Metropolis that the Justice League was involved in. He blames the League for this, displacing his own guilt. To exact revenge, he steals the Medusa Mask and becomes the Psycho-Pirate, first turning civilians against the League and then using the members' deeply hidden resentments to turn them against each other. By shape-shifting the emotion centers of his brain, Martian Manhunter frees himself and stops the Pirate's rampage by going into Hayden's memories of his family. Hayden is later seen in a straitjacket after this; doctors believe that the Medusa Mask has driven him insane. However, the \"horrors\" they say he is experiencing in his mind turn out to be him telling his wife and son that he loves them.\n* Psycho-Pirate appears as the primary antagonist of a special one-shot ''[[Young Justice (TV series)|Young Justice]]'' issue published for [[Free Comic Book Day]]. He is shown working with [[Atomic Skull]] as part of a scheme to steal [[plutonium]] from a [[STAR Labs]] facility. Psycho-Pirate uses his Medusa Mask to force [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]], [[Miss Martian]], [[Aqualad (Jackson Hyde)|Aqualad]], [[Robin (Dick Grayson)|Robin]], and [[Kid Flash (Wally West)|Kid Flash]] to confront their inner demons, but is defeated and captured when Kid Flash breaks out of the illusion and removes the Medusa Mask from Psycho-Pirate's face.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.dialbforblog.com/archives/193 Fanpage about the Psycho-Pirate (both Halstead and Hayden)]\n{{Timeline\n|before= \u2190 The character Solomon Grundy was debuted by Alfred Bester and Paul Reinman.
