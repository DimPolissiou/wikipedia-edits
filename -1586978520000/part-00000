Almaas''' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0251\u02d0|l|m|\u0259|s}} {{respell|AHL|m\u0259ss}}) is the pen name of '''A. Hameed Ali''' (born 1944), a [[Kuwaiti Americans|Kuwaiti American]] author and spiritual teacher who writes about and teaches an approach to spiritual development informed by modern psychology and therapy which he calls the [[Diamond Approach]]. \"Almaas\" is the [[Arabic]] word for \"diamond.\" \n\nAlmaas is originally from [[Kuwait]]. He is the spiritual head of the Ridhwan School. He may be described, among other things, as an [[Integral theory (philosophy)|Integral theorist]], [[mysticism|mystic]], [[spiritual teacher]] or an exponent of the [[perennial philosophy]].\n\nAlmaas' books were originally published by the Ridhwan School, under the Diamond Books publishing title, but are now published by [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]].\n\nThe Diamond Approach is a contemporary spiritual path integrating the teachings and practices of the ancient wisdom traditions with modern [[depth psychology]] ([[object relations theory]] in particular). The Diamond Approach is derived from the experiences of Almaas, along with Karen Johnson and Faisal Muqaddam (who split off early on to develop his own approach). They were among the first students of [[Claudio Naranjo]], an early pioneer of the integration of spiritual and therapeutic work.\n\nThe curriculum of the work draws upon the founders' backgrounds in [[Sufism]], [[Platonism]], [[Buddhism]] and the [[Fourth Way]]. Teachers of the Diamond Approach focus on the students' specific perception of their own immediate work issues.<ref>http://www.ridhwan.org/school/faqs.html \"Q: Who can teach the Diamond Approach?\"</ref> Presentation of a canonical body of knowledge and practice is introduced over time as required.\n\n== Biography ==\nA. Hameed Ali was born in [[Kuwait]] in 1944. At the age of eighteen, he moved to the United States to study at the [[University of California]] in [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]]. Hameed was working on his PhD in physics when he reached a turning point in his life that led him more and more into inquiring into the psychological and spiritual aspects of human nature. His interest in the truth of human nature and the true nature of reality resulted in the creation and unfoldment of the Diamond Approach.<ref name=bio>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=A. Hameed Ali|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/almaas_bio.htm|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\n== Diamond Approach ==\nThe Diamond Approach is a spiritual teaching that utilizes a unique kind of inquiry into realization, where the practice is the expression of realization. Its aim is absolute freedom that can be described as living realization, a dynamic enlightenment where transcendent truth lives personally in the world. This inquiry opens up the infinite creativity of our Being, transforming our lives into a runaway realization, moving from realization to further realization.<ref>{{cite web|last=Almaas|first=A.H.|title=The Diamond Approach \u2013 Hameed Ali (A. H. Almaas)|url=http://www.ahalmaas.com/|website=ahalmaas.com}}</ref>\n\nThe Ridhwan Foundation is the nonprofit spiritual organization established to support and preserve the integrity of the Diamond Approach teaching. The Ridhwan Foundation is legally recognized as a church and the role of a teacher is equivalent to that of a minister. People are ordained as spiritual teachers of the Ridhwan Foundation, which is the name given to its ministers.\n\n=== Spiritual practice as a phenomenology of being ===\nThe Diamond Approach is described as a \"response to an important need that is being felt in many quarters, a need for a spiritually informed psychology, or conversely, for a psychologically grounded spirituality. This perspective does not separate psychological and spiritual experience, and hence sees no dichotomy between depth psychology and spiritual work... This body of knowledge is not an integration or synthesis of modern depth psychology and traditional spiritual understanding. The inclination to think in terms of integration of the two is due to the prevailing belief in the dichotomy between the fields of psychology and spirituality, a dichotomy in which the Diamond Mind understanding does not participate.\" (Almaas)<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''The Void: Inner Spaciousness and Ego Structure'', Shambhala Publications, Boston MA, 1986.</ref>\n\nThe Diamond Approach, according to its followers, can be called a Phenomenology of Being that offers a precise description of the various aspects and dimensions of Spirit or Being and is also a form of [[Spirituality|spiritual]] psychotherapy which seeks to heal the wounds of the soul by reconnecting it to Spirit.\n\n=== Principal ideas ===\n\n==== Structure of reality ====\nIn the Diamond Approach, reality is seen as consisting of three elements: God/Being/Spirit, Soul/Self and World/Cosmos.\n\n''Being'' is understood as the inner source and true nature of reality, which is the focus of the great spiritual traditions of both East and West, and is known as ''[[Dharmakaya]]'', ''[[Shunyata]]'', ''[[Brahman]]'' or ''[[Tao]]''. Being is understood as consisting of five co-emergent \"boundless dimensions\": Divine Love, Pure Presence, Nonconceptual Awareness, The Logos, and The Absolute.\n\n''Soul'' is understood to be the individual consciousness that connects the world with Being, an idea found in ancient [[Chinese philosophy]]. It is believed in the Diamond Approach that the soul can be experienced as a living presence that contains the thoughts, feelings and sensations usually called our \"self\".\n\n''World'' is understood as the outer manifestation of reality, the multitude of physical forms that all people are familiar with.\n\n==== Essence and the essential aspects ====\nWhile most spiritual paths conceive of Being as universal, the Diamond Approach also pays a great deal of attention to a more individual way of experiencing Being, called Essence. The concept of Essence is similar to the Hindu idea of ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|Atman]]''. While Being is the true nature of all of reality, Essence is the portion of it that forms the true and personal nature of the soul. It is experienced as a substantial fluid Presence which can differentiate into various qualities or aspects, such as compassion, strength, will, joy, peace, love, value, humanness, personalness, identity, and space.<ref>Almaas, A. H. ''Essence'' Weiser Books, Boston MA, 1986.</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm Essence & Spiritual Presence] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080707032123/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/e/essence.htm |date=7 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n==== Theory of holes ====\nAs our soul develops it is faced with a double challenge: it must learn to function in the World, while also remaining connected to Spirit. For various reasons, some innate and others environmental, we slowly become alienated from our Essence through the development of fixed patterns of perception and behaviour known as the personality or ego. Each of these patterns or ego structures disconnects us from a specific Essential Aspect. In other words, it is built around the \"Hole\" of this aspect. By exploring its structure, both cognitively and experientially, one eventually confronts the Hole and by going through it the lost aspect is retrieved.<ref>Ch. 2 \u2013 \"The Theory of Holes.\" Almaas, A. H. ''Diamond Heart Book 1'', Shambhala, 2000.</ref>\n\n=== Methodology ===\nThe Diamond Approach uses methods which its founders learned from Claudio Naranjo. Almaas' scientific background (he studied physics at Berkeley<ref name=bio />) helps explain the emphasis on rigorous (self) inquiry. Several contexts for participation are provided, including regular one-on-one sessions with a trained teacher, seminars and participation in various formats of organized ongoing groups.<ref>[http://www.ridhwan.org/school/involved.html Ridhwan School \u2013 How to get Involved]</ref>\n\n==== Presence ====\nThe practice referred to as \"presence\" is based on two methods, learning to sense one's body (especially one's arms and legs) in an ongoing manner and regularly focusing one's attention on a point in the belly called the \"kath center\" (known in Chinese philosophy as the ''tan tien''). These methods help a person to become more grounded in the body and in physical reality and also, in time, to develop the ability to experience oneself as the presence of Essence.\n\n==== Inquiry ====\nThe Diamond Approach centers on practice of investigation of the self, experience and perception.  \"Inquiry\" answers the question posed by [[Socrates]]: \"How does one set up as the object of one's investigation, that about which one knows nothing?\"{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  One starts by wanting to find out, living a question, while recognizing preconceptions, preconditions and expectations as to the nature of what one may learn and instead attending to one's immediate or present experience. While not explicitly acknowledged as such, inquiry in effect combines (as a descriptive mechanism only, as the inquiry process is beyond mere language) the practice of [[Edmund Husserl]]'s \"transcendental phenomenological reduction, or epoch\u00e9\", with [[Sigmund Freud]]'s psychodynamic exploration. An important feature of inquiry is that a person learns to be aware of both the content of experience (emotions, thoughts, sensations) and the attitudes and reactions towards it. In this way the subject-object dichotomy is transcended and one learns to relate to oneself without having to create inner splits. Open-ended inquiry is both a path to, and the state of, a realized person and in time is understood to be a self-revelation of the mysteries of Being.\n\n=== Motivation ===\nThe main motivation for embarking on the spiritual journey in this approach is love for the Truth. \"Truth\" refers to seeing things as they really are, which ultimately comes down to recognizing Being as the true nature of everything. Love for the truth therefore combines the traditional [[bhakti]] and [[jnana]] perspectives on spirituality.<ref>http://www.ridhwan.org/school/faqs.html \u2013 \"Q: What is the goal of the Diamond Approach?\"</ref><ref>[http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm Truth] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080725054112/http://www.ahalmaas.com/glossary/t/truth.htm |date=25 July 2008 }}</ref>\n\n== Critiques ==\nThe fees associated with the retreats and other methodologies that are part of the structure of the school have been criticized.<ref name=\"dailyCamera\">{{cite news |url=http://www.dailycamera.com/ci_12960184 |title=New path: Ridhwan teaches new way of looking at the world |date= 17 April 2009 | work=[[Daily Camera]]|accessdate=15 October 2016}}</ref> However, the fees are relatively low compared to other spiritual schools and retreats.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Furthermore, the founder and lead teacher, Hameed Ali, regularly points out that the Diamond Approach is only one path to truth and cannot in itself be all-encompassing.  Students are permitted and even encouraged to question the practices of the school and to explore whether the school is a good fit for them personally.\n\nIn addition to the fees associated with the retreats, participants become provisional members of the Ridhwan Foundation (legally a church). After an unspecified designated period of time, they are asked to confirm membership by paying the appropriate membership fees to the foundation. These membership fees are $160/year for students involved in the group teachings and $60/year for provisional members.\n\nThe work of Almaas has received praise from spiritual teachers and explorers such as [[John Welwood]], [[Brant Cortright]], [[Gabor Mat\u00e9]], [[Jack Kornfield]] and [[Ken Wilber]].<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free. Your personality itself is free from its suffering and conflict.\"<ref>''Diamond Heart, Book 2'', pg. 11 \u2013 http://www.ridhwan.org/school/school.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe school rejects \"quick fixes\" and graduation, and the students are engaged in learning and therapy for an indefinite period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34BBA41766BD2A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Treating the Soul for Life: School rejects 'quick fixes' |date= 23 October 1992 | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Elixir of Enlightenment'', 1984, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|978-0-87728-613-4}}\n*''Essence: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1986, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|0-87728-627-2}}\n*''Essence with The Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1998, [[Weiser Books]], {{ISBN|1-57863-044-4}}\n*''Facets of Unity: The Enneagram of Holy Ideas'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-14-4}}\n*''Luminous Night's Journey: An Autobiographical Fragment'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-08-3}}\n*''The Inner Journey Home: Soul's Realization of the Unity of Reality'', 2004, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-1-59030-109-8}}\n*''The Power of Divine Eros''.

''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (372-373)</ref> Wilber, while tentatively supportive of the Diamond Approach, disputes some details. For example, he does not agree that infants have essential experiences, maintaining that the infant exists purely in the physical, material world \u2013 \"instinctual, vital, impulsive, narcissistic, egocentric; living for food, its God is all mouth.\"<ref>Wilber, K. ''Eye of the Spirit'' Shambhala: Boston, 1997 (362\u2013363)</ref> Almaas has responded that Wilber's critique demonstrates a misinterpretation based on Wilber's own linear, four-stage categorization of spiritual development. Almaas' perspective is that infants experience a type of true nature/Spirit, but one that is very distinct from, and less integrated than, the experiences of essentially realized adults.<ref>Appendix D in Almaas, A. H. ''The Inner Journey Home'', Shambhala: Boston, 2004.</ref>\n\n== Ridhwan School ==\nThe Ridhwan School is a loosely-knit affiliation of ongoing spiritual groups founded in 1976 by Almaas. The school is dedicated to the teaching of the Diamond Approach. It is principally based in [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Boulder, Colorado]] with other groups throughout North America and in parts of Europe and Australia.   Almaas is the spiritual head of the school and individual groups are taught by qualified Ridhwan teachers. The name of the school derives from the Arabic word for \"contentment\":\n\n<blockquote>\"Ridhwan is a kind of contentment which arises when you're liberated. Your personality becomes contented when you're free. Your personality itself is free from its suffering and conflict.\"<ref>''Diamond Heart, Book 2'', pg. 11 \u2013 http://www.ridhwan.org/school/school.html</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe school rejects \"quick fixes\" and graduation, and the students are engaged in learning and therapy for an indefinite period.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&p_multi=CSGB&d_place=CSGB&p_theme=newslibrary2&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0F34BBA41766BD2A&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Treating the Soul for Life: School rejects 'quick fixes' |date= 23 October 1992 | work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)]]|accessdate=12 July 2008}}</ref>\n\n== Bibliography ==\n*''The Elixir of Enlightenment'', 1984, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|978-0-87728-613-4}}\n*''Essence: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1986, [[Weiser Books|Red Wheel Weiser]], {{ISBN|0-87728-627-2}}\n*''Essence with The Elixir of Enlightenment: The Diamond Approach to Inner Realization'', 1998, [[Weiser Books]], {{ISBN|1-57863-044-4}}\n*''Facets of Unity: The Enneagram of Holy Ideas'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-14-4}}\n*''Luminous Night's Journey: An Autobiographical Fragment'', 2000, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-0-936713-08-3}}\n*''The Inner Journey Home: Soul's Realization of the Unity of Reality'', 2004, [[Shambhala Publications|Shambhala]], {{ISBN|978-1-59030-109-8}}\n*''The Power of Divine Eros''.

The first report of a smoking Englishman is of a sailor in Bristol in 1556, seen \"emitting smoke from his nostrils\".<ref name=\"L&M\"/> Like tea, coffee and opium, tobacco was just one of many intoxicants that was originally used as a form of medicine.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gilman|Xun|2004|p=38}}</ref> Tobacco was introduced around 1600 by French merchants in what today is modern-day [[Gambia]] and [[Senegal]]. At the same time, caravans from [[Morocco]] brought tobacco to the areas around [[Timbuktu]], and the Portuguese brought the commodity (and the plant) to southern Africa, establishing the popularity of tobacco throughout all of Africa by the 1650s.\n\nSoon after its introduction to the Old World, tobacco came under frequent criticism from state and religious leaders. [[James VI and I]], King of Scotland and England, produced the treatise ''[[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]]'' in 1604, and also introduced excise duty on the product. [[Murad IV]], sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]] 1623\u201340 was among the first to attempt a smoking ban by claiming it was a threat to public morals and health. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] of China issued an edict banning smoking two years before his death and the overthrow of the [[Ming dynasty]]. Later, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] rulers of the [[Qing dynasty]], would proclaim smoking \"a more heinous crime than that even of neglecting archery\". In [[Edo period]] Japan, some of the earliest tobacco plantations were scorned by the [[shogunate]] as being a threat to the military economy by letting valuable farmland go to waste for the use of a recreational drug instead of being used to plant food crops.<ref name=\"Screech-Smoke\">{{Harvnb|Gilman|Xun|2004|pp=92\u201399}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bonsack machine.png|thumb|Bonsack's cigarette rolling machine, as shown on U.S. patent 238,640.]]\n\nReligious leaders have often been prominent among those who considered smoking immoral or outright blasphemous. In 1634, the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] forbade the sale of tobacco, and sentenced men and women who flouted the ban to have their nostrils slit and their backs flayed. Pope [[Urban VIII]] likewise condemned smoking on holy places in a papal bull of 1624. Despite some concerted efforts, restrictions and bans were largely ignored. When [[James I of England]], a staunch anti-smoker and the author of ''[[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]]'', tried to curb the new trend by enforcing a 4000% tax increase on tobacco in 1604 it was unsuccessful, as suggested by the presence of around 7,000 tobacco outlets in London by the early 17th century. From this point on for some centuries, several administrations withdrew from efforts at discouragement and instead turned tobacco trade and cultivation into sometimes lucrative government monopolies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gilman|Xun|2004|pp=15\u201316}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=King James I of England|title=A Counterblaste to Tobacco|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/james/blaste/|accessdate=22 March 2009|date=16 April 2002|origyear=1604|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-17th century most major civilizations had been introduced to tobacco smoking and in many cases had already assimilated it into the native culture, despite some continued attempts upon the parts of rulers to eliminate the practice with penalties or fines. Tobacco, both product and plant, followed the major trade routes to major ports and markets, and then on into the hinterlands.

The genus contains a number of species, however, ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' is the most commonly grown. ''[[Nicotiana rustica]]'' follows as second containing higher concentrations of nicotine. These leaves are harvested and cured to allow for the slow [[oxidation]] and degradation of [[carotenoid]]s in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves which can be attributed to sweet hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavors. Before packaging, the tobacco is often combined with other additives in order to enhance the addictive potency, shift the products [[pH]], or improve the effects of smoke by making it more palatable. In the United States these additives are regulated to [[List of additives in cigarettes|599 substances]].<ref name=\"WHOJeffreyWigand\"/> The product is then processed, packaged, and shipped to consumer markets.\n\n{{multiple image|align=right|direction=vertical|width=180|image1=Nicotiana Tobacco Plants 1909px.jpg|alt1=Field of tobacco organized in rows extending to the horizon.|caption1=Tobacco field in [[Intercourse, Pennsylvania]].|image2=Basma-tobacco-drying.jpg|alt2=Powderly stripps hung vertically, slightly sun bleached.|caption2=[[Tobacco leaves|Basma]] leaves curing in the sun at [[Pomak]] village of [[Xanthi]], Thrace, Greece.|image3=DunhillLightFlake.jpg|alt3=Rectangular strips stacked in an open square box.|caption3=Processed tobacco pressed into flakes for pipe smoking.}}\n\n;Beedi: [[Beedi]]s are thin South Asian cigarettes filled with tobacco flakes and wrapped in a tendu leaf tied with a string at one end.

The quality and variety of tobacco play an important role in kretek production, from which kretek can contain more than 30 types of tobacco.

In 2004 the United States prohibited cigarettes from having a \"characterizing flavor\" of certain ingredients other than tobacco and menthol, thereby removing kretek from being classified as cigarettes.<ref>{{Cite press release|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:SN02461:@@@D&summ2=m&|accessdate=1 August 2007|publisher=Library of Congress|title=A bill to protect the public health by providing the Food and Drug Administration with certain authority to regulate tobacco products. (Summary)|date=20 May 2004}}</ref>\n;Passive smoking: [[Passive smoking]] is the usually involuntary consumption of smoked tobacco. Second-hand smoke (SHS) is the consumption where the burning end is present, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) or [[third-hand smoke]] is the consumption of the smoke that remains after the burning end has been extinguished. Because of its negative implications, this form of consumption has played a central role in the regulation of tobacco products.\n;Pipe smoking: [[Pipe smoking]] is done with a tobacco pipe, typically consisting of a small chamber (the bowl) for the combustion of the tobacco to be smoked and a thin stem (shank) that ends in a mouthpiece (the bit). Shredded pieces of tobacco are placed into the chamber and ignited.\n;Roll-your-own: [[Roll-your-own cigarette|Roll-your-own]] or hand-rolled cigarettes, often called \"rollies\", \"cigi\" or \"Roll-ups\", are very popular particularly in European countries and the UK. These are prepared from loose tobacco, cigarette papers, and filters all bought separately. They are usually much cheaper than ready-made cigarettes and small contraptions can be bought making the process easier.\n;Vaporizer: A [[vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporizer]] is a device used to sublimate the active ingredients of plant material. Rather than burning the herb, which produces potentially irritating, toxic, or [[carcinogen]]ic by-products; a vaporizer heats the material in a partial vacuum so that the active compounds contained in the plant boil off into a vapor. This method is often preferable when medically administrating the smoke substance, as opposed to directly pyrolyzing the plant material.\n\n===Physiology===\n{{See also|Chain smoking}}\n[[File:Blood nicotine graph.jpg|thumb|A graph that shows the efficiency of smoking as a way to absorb nicotine compared to other forms of intake.]]\n\nThe active substances in tobacco, especially cigarettes, are administered by burning the leaves and inhaling the vaporized gas that results. This quickly and effectively delivers substances into the bloodstream by absorption through the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in the lungs. The lungs contain some 300 million alveoli, which amounts to a surface area of over 70&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (about the size of a tennis court). This method is not completely efficient as not all of the smoke will be inhaled, and some amount of the active substances will be lost in the process of combustion, [[pyrolysis]].<ref name=\"GilmanXun2004p318\">{{Harvnb|Gilman|Xun|2004|p=318}}</ref> Pipe and Cigar smoke are not inhaled because of its high [[alkalinity]], which are irritating to the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and lungs.

Writers in particular seem to be known for smoking, for example, [[Cornell University|Cornell]] Professor Richard Klein's book ''Cigarettes are Sublime'' for the analysis, by this professor of French literature, of the role smoking plays in 19th and 20th century letters. The popular author [[Kurt Vonnegut]] addressed his addiction to cigarettes within his novels. British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] was well known for smoking a pipe in public as was [[Winston Churchill]] for his cigars. [[Sherlock Holmes]], the fictional detective created by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] smoked a pipe, cigarettes, and cigars. The [[DC Comics|DC]] [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] comic book character, [[John Constantine]], created by [[Alan Moore]], is synonymous with smoking, so much so that the first storyline by [[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]] creator, [[Garth Ennis]], centered around John Constantine contracting lung cancer.

''Sema'', the [[Anishinaabe]] word for tobacco, is grown for ceremonial use and considered the ultimate sacred plant since its smoke is believed to carry prayers to the spirits. In most major religions, however, tobacco smoking is not specifically prohibited, although it may be discouraged as an immoral habit. Before the health risks of smoking were identified through controlled study, smoking was considered an immoral habit by certain Christian preachers and social reformers. The founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Joseph Smith]], recorded that on 27 February 1833, he received a [[revelation]] which discouraged tobacco use. This \"Word of Wisdom\" was later accepted as a commandment, and faithful Latter-day Saints abstain completely from tobacco.<ref>{{Cite web | author = Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | year = 2009 | title = Obey the Word of Wisdom | url = http://www.e-sheesh.com/obey-the-word-of-wisdom.html | work = Basic Beliefs \u2013 The Commandments | accessdate = 15 October 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150904081039/http://www.e-sheesh.com/obey-the-word-of-wisdom.html | archive-date = 4 September 2015 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Jehovah's Witnesses base their stand against smoking on the Bible's command to \"clean ourselves of every defilement of flesh\" (2 Corinthians 7:1).

Countries that sign on as parties agree to a set of common goals, minimum standards for tobacco control policy, and to cooperate in dealing with cross-border challenges such as cigarette smuggling. Currently the WHO declares that 4&nbsp;billion people will be covered by the treaty, which includes 168 signatories.<ref>[http://www.who.int/tobacco/framework/countrylist/en/ Updated status of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]</ref> Among other steps, signatories are to put together legislation that will eliminate secondhand smoke in indoor workplaces, public transport, indoor public places and, as appropriate, other public places.\n\n===Taxation===\n{{See also|Cigarette taxes in the United States}}\n\nMany governments have introduced [[excise tax]]es on cigarettes in order to reduce the consumption of cigarettes. The World Health Organisation finds that:\n\n:The structure of tobacco excise taxes varies considerably across countries, with lower income countries more likely to rely more on ''ad valorem'' excises and higher income countries more likely to rely more on specific excise taxes, while many countries at all income levels use a mix of specific and ''ad valorem'' excises. \n:Tobacco excise tax systems are quite complex in several countries, where different tax rates are applied based on prices, product characteristics such as presence/absence of a filter or length, packaging, weight, tobacco content, and/or production or sales volume. These complex systems are difficult to administer, create opportunities for tax avoidance, and are less effective from a public health perspective.\n:Globally, cigarette excise taxes account for less than 45 percent of cigarette prices, on average, while all taxes applied to cigarettes account for just over half of half of price. Higher income countries levy higher taxes on tobacco products and these taxes account for a greater share of price, with both the absolute tax and share of price accounted for by tax falling as country incomes fall.<ref>https://www.who.int/tobacco/economics/1globalregionaloverview.pdf?ua=1</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] said that each [[Cigarette pack|pack]] of cigarettes{{how many|date=August 2018}} sold in the United States costs the nation more than $7 in medical care and lost productivity,<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\"/> around $3400 per year per smoker. Another study by a team of health economists finds the combined price paid by their families and society is about $41 per pack of cigarettes.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/November 26, 2004-smoking-costs_x.htm Study: Cigarettes cost families, society $41 per pack]</ref>\n\nSubstantial scientific evidence shows that higher cigarette prices result in lower overall cigarette consumption. Most studies indicate that a 10% increase in price will reduce overall cigarette consumption by 3% to 5%. Youth, minorities, and low-income smokers are two to three times more likely to quit or smoke less than other smokers in response to price increases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4916a1.htm|title=Reducing Tobacco Use|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://tc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/2/86|title=Higher cigarette prices influence cigarette purchase patterns|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=14|issue=2|pages=86\u201392|accessdate=29 February 2016|doi=10.1136/tc.2004.008730|pmid=15791017|pmc=1748009|year=2005|last1=Hyland|first1=A.|last2=Bauer|first2=J.

On 1 September 2007 the minimum age to buy tobacco products in Germany rose from 16 to 18, as well as in the United Kingdom where on 1 October 2007 it rose from 16 to 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobacco18.co.uk/index.html|title=Tobacco Sales Law|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref> Underlying such laws is the belief that people should make an informed decision regarding the risks of tobacco use. These laws have a lax enforcement in some nations and states. In China, Turkey, and many other countries usually a child will have little problem buying tobacco products, because they are often told to go to the store to buy tobacco for their parents.\n\nSeveral countries such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Portugal, [[Singapore]], Italy, [[Indonesia]], India, [[Lithuania]], [[Chile]], Spain, [[Iceland]], United Kingdom, [[Slovenia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Malta]] have legislated against smoking in public places, often including bars and restaurants. Restaurateurs have been permitted in some jurisdictions to build designated smoking areas (or to prohibit smoking). In the United States, many states prohibit smoking in restaurants, and some also prohibit smoking in bars. In provinces of Canada, smoking is illegal in indoor workplaces and public places, including bars and restaurants. As of 31 March 2008 Canada has introduced a smoke-free law ban in all public places, as well as within 10 metres of an entrance to any public place. In Australia, smoke-free laws vary from state to state. Currently, Queensland has completely smoke-free indoor public places (including workplaces, bars, pubs and eateries) as well as patrolled beaches and some outdoor public areas. There are, however, exceptions for designated smoking areas. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], smoking is restricted in railway stations, bus stops and tram stops as these are public locations where [[second-hand smoke]] can affect non-smokers waiting for public transport, and since 1 July 2007 is now extended to all indoor public places. In New Zealand and [[Brazil]], smoking is restricted in enclosed public places including bars, restaurants and pubs. Hong Kong restricted smoking on 1 January 2007 in the workplace, public spaces such as restaurants, karaoke rooms, buildings, and public parks (bars which do not admit minors were exempt until 2009). In [[Romania]] smoking is illegal in trains, metro stations, public institutions (except where designated, usually outside) and public transport.\nIn [[Germany]], additionally to smoking bans in public buildings and transports, an anti-smoking ordinance for bars and restaurants was implemented in late 2007. A study by the University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) demonstrates, that the smoking ban had, if any, only short run impacts on bar and restaurant revenues. In the medium and long run no negative effect was measurable. The results suggest either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, that negative revenue impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers.<ref>Ahlfeldt, G., Maennig, W. (2010), Impact of non-smoking ordinances on hospitality revenues: The case of Germany, in Journal of Economics and Statistics, 230(5), 506\u2013521; preliminary version in: Hamburg Contemporary Discussion Papers N\u00b0 26, http://www.uni-hamburg.de/economicpolicy/hced.html.</ref>\n\n===Ignition safety===\nAn indirect public health problem posed by cigarettes is that of accidental fires, usually linked with consumption of alcohol. Enhanced combustion using nitrates was traditionally used but cigarette manufacturers have been silent on this subject claiming at first that a safe cigarette was technically impossible, then that it could only be achieved by modifying the paper. Roll your own cigarettes contain no additives and are fire safe. Numerous [[fire safe cigarette]] designs have been proposed, some by tobacco companies themselves, which would extinguish a cigarette left unattended for more than a minute or two, thereby reducing the risk of fire. Among American tobacco companies, some have resisted this idea, while others have embraced it.

At the same time, caravans from [[Morocco]] brought tobacco to the areas around [[Timbuktu]], and the Portuguese brought the commodity (and the plant) to southern Africa, establishing the popularity of tobacco throughout all of Africa by the 1650s.\n\nSoon after its introduction to the Old World, tobacco came under frequent criticism from state and religious leaders. [[James VI and I]], King of Scotland and England, produced the treatise ''[[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]]'' in 1604, and also introduced excise duty on the product. [[Murad IV]], sultan of the [[Ottoman Empire]] 1623\u201340 was among the first to attempt a smoking ban by claiming it was a threat to public morals and health. The [[Chongzhen Emperor]] of China issued an edict banning smoking two years before his death and the overthrow of the [[Ming dynasty]]. Later, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] rulers of the [[Qing dynasty]], would proclaim smoking \"a more heinous crime than that even of neglecting archery\". In [[Edo period]] Japan, some of the earliest tobacco plantations were scorned by the [[shogunate]] as being a threat to the military economy by letting valuable farmland go to waste for the use of a recreational drug instead of being used to plant food crops.<ref name=\"Screech-Smoke\">{{Harvnb|Gilman|Xun|2004|pp=92\u201399}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bonsack machine.png|thumb|Bonsack's cigarette rolling machine, as shown on U.S. patent 238,640.]]\n\nReligious leaders have often been prominent among those who considered smoking immoral or outright blasphemous. In 1634, the [[Patriarch of Moscow]] forbade the sale of tobacco, and sentenced men and women who flouted the ban to have their nostrils slit and their backs flayed. Pope [[Urban VIII]] likewise condemned smoking on holy places in a papal bull of 1624. Despite some concerted efforts, restrictions and bans were largely ignored. When [[James I of England]], a staunch anti-smoker and the author of ''[[A Counterblaste to Tobacco]]'', tried to curb the new trend by enforcing a 4000% tax increase on tobacco in 1604 it was unsuccessful, as suggested by the presence of around 7,000 tobacco outlets in London by the early 17th century. From this point on for some centuries, several administrations withdrew from efforts at discouragement and instead turned tobacco trade and cultivation into sometimes lucrative government monopolies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Gilman|Xun|2004|pp=15\u201316}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|author=King James I of England|title=A Counterblaste to Tobacco|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/poltheory/james/blaste/|accessdate=22 March 2009|date=16 April 2002|origyear=1604|publisher=University of Texas at Austin|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\nBy the mid-17th century most major civilizations had been introduced to tobacco smoking and in many cases had already assimilated it into the native culture, despite some continued attempts upon the parts of rulers to eliminate the practice with penalties or fines.

The genus contains a number of species, however, ''[[Nicotiana tabacum]]'' is the most commonly grown. ''[[Nicotiana rustica]]'' follows as second containing higher concentrations of nicotine. These leaves are harvested and cured to allow for the slow [[oxidation]] and degradation of [[carotenoid]]s in tobacco leaf. This produces certain compounds in the tobacco leaves which can be attributed to sweet hay, tea, rose oil, or fruity aromatic flavors. Before packaging, the tobacco is often combined with other additives in order to enhance the addictive potency, shift the products [[pH]], or improve the effects of smoke by making it more palatable.

Second-hand smoke (SHS) is the consumption where the burning end is present, environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) or [[third-hand smoke]] is the consumption of the smoke that remains after the burning end has been extinguished. Because of its negative implications, this form of consumption has played a central role in the regulation of tobacco products.\n;Pipe smoking: [[Pipe smoking]] is done with a tobacco pipe, typically consisting of a small chamber (the bowl) for the combustion of the tobacco to be smoked and a thin stem (shank) that ends in a mouthpiece (the bit). Shredded pieces of tobacco are placed into the chamber and ignited.\n;Roll-your-own: [[Roll-your-own cigarette|Roll-your-own]] or hand-rolled cigarettes, often called \"rollies\", \"cigi\" or \"Roll-ups\", are very popular particularly in European countries and the UK. These are prepared from loose tobacco, cigarette papers, and filters all bought separately. They are usually much cheaper than ready-made cigarettes and small contraptions can be bought making the process easier.\n;Vaporizer: A [[vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporizer]] is a device used to sublimate the active ingredients of plant material. Rather than burning the herb, which produces potentially irritating, toxic, or [[carcinogen]]ic by-products; a vaporizer heats the material in a partial vacuum so that the active compounds contained in the plant boil off into a vapor. This method is often preferable when medically administrating the smoke substance, as opposed to directly pyrolyzing the plant material.\n\n===Physiology===\n{{See also|Chain smoking}}\n[[File:Blood nicotine graph.jpg|thumb|A graph that shows the efficiency of smoking as a way to absorb nicotine compared to other forms of intake.]]\n\nThe active substances in tobacco, especially cigarettes, are administered by burning the leaves and inhaling the vaporized gas that results. This quickly and effectively delivers substances into the bloodstream by absorption through the [[Pulmonary alveolus|alveoli]] in the lungs. The lungs contain some 300 million alveoli, which amounts to a surface area of over 70&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> (about the size of a tennis court). This method is not completely efficient as not all of the smoke will be inhaled, and some amount of the active substances will be lost in the process of combustion, [[pyrolysis]].<ref name=\"GilmanXun2004p318\">{{Harvnb|Gilman|Xun|2004|p=318}}</ref> Pipe and Cigar smoke are not inhaled because of its high [[alkalinity]], which are irritating to the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and lungs.

Writers in particular seem to be known for smoking, for example, [[Cornell University|Cornell]] Professor Richard Klein's book ''Cigarettes are Sublime'' for the analysis, by this professor of French literature, of the role smoking plays in 19th and 20th century letters. The popular author [[Kurt Vonnegut]] addressed his addiction to cigarettes within his novels. British Prime Minister [[Harold Wilson]] was well known for smoking a pipe in public as was [[Winston Churchill]] for his cigars. [[Sherlock Holmes]], the fictional detective created by [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] smoked a pipe, cigarettes, and cigars. The [[DC Comics|DC]] [[Vertigo Comics|Vertigo]] comic book character, [[John Constantine]], created by [[Alan Moore]], is synonymous with smoking, so much so that the first storyline by [[Preacher (comics)|Preacher]] creator, [[Garth Ennis]], centered around John Constantine contracting lung cancer.

''Sema'', the [[Anishinaabe]] word for tobacco, is grown for ceremonial use and considered the ultimate sacred plant since its smoke is believed to carry prayers to the spirits. In most major religions, however, tobacco smoking is not specifically prohibited, although it may be discouraged as an immoral habit. Before the health risks of smoking were identified through controlled study, smoking was considered an immoral habit by certain Christian preachers and social reformers. The founder of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]], [[Joseph Smith]], recorded that on 27 February 1833, he received a [[revelation]] which discouraged tobacco use. This \"Word of Wisdom\" was later accepted as a commandment, and faithful Latter-day Saints abstain completely from tobacco.<ref>{{Cite web | author = Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints | year = 2009 | title = Obey the Word of Wisdom | url = http://www.e-sheesh.com/obey-the-word-of-wisdom.html | work = Basic Beliefs \u2013 The Commandments | accessdate = 15 October 2009 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20150904081039/http://www.e-sheesh.com/obey-the-word-of-wisdom.html | archive-date = 4 September 2015 | url-status = dead | df = dmy-all }}</ref> Jehovah's Witnesses base their stand against smoking on the Bible's command to \"clean ourselves of every defilement of flesh\" (2 Corinthians 7:1).

The FCTC is the world's first public health treaty. Countries that sign on as parties agree to a set of common goals, minimum standards for tobacco control policy, and to cooperate in dealing with cross-border challenges such as cigarette smuggling. Currently the WHO declares that 4&nbsp;billion people will be covered by the treaty, which includes 168 signatories.<ref>[http://www.who.int/tobacco/framework/countrylist/en/ Updated status of the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control]</ref> Among other steps, signatories are to put together legislation that will eliminate secondhand smoke in indoor workplaces, public transport, indoor public places and, as appropriate, other public places.\n\n===Taxation===\n{{See also|Cigarette taxes in the United States}}\n\nMany governments have introduced [[excise tax]]es on cigarettes in order to reduce the consumption of cigarettes. The World Health Organisation finds that:\n\n:The structure of tobacco excise taxes varies considerably across countries, with lower income countries more likely to rely more on ''ad valorem'' excises and higher income countries more likely to rely more on specific excise taxes, while many countries at all income levels use a mix of specific and ''ad valorem'' excises. \n:Tobacco excise tax systems are quite complex in several countries, where different tax rates are applied based on prices, product characteristics such as presence/absence of a filter or length, packaging, weight, tobacco content, and/or production or sales volume. These complex systems are difficult to administer, create opportunities for tax avoidance, and are less effective from a public health perspective.\n:Globally, cigarette excise taxes account for less than 45 percent of cigarette prices, on average, while all taxes applied to cigarettes account for just over half of half of price. Higher income countries levy higher taxes on tobacco products and these taxes account for a greater share of price, with both the absolute tax and share of price accounted for by tax falling as country incomes fall.<ref>https://www.who.int/tobacco/economics/1globalregionaloverview.pdf?ua=1</ref>\n\nIn 2002, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] said that each [[Cigarette pack|pack]] of cigarettes{{how many|date=August 2018}} sold in the United States costs the nation more than $7 in medical care and lost productivity,<ref name=\"query.nytimes.com\"/> around $3400 per year per smoker. Another study by a team of health economists finds the combined price paid by their families and society is about $41 per pack of cigarettes.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/November 26, 2004-smoking-costs_x.htm Study: Cigarettes cost families, society $41 per pack]</ref>\n\nSubstantial scientific evidence shows that higher cigarette prices result in lower overall cigarette consumption. Most studies indicate that a 10% increase in price will reduce overall cigarette consumption by 3% to 5%. Youth, minorities, and low-income smokers are two to three times more likely to quit or smoke less than other smokers in response to price increases.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/rr4916a1.htm|title=Reducing Tobacco Use|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://tc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/2/86|title=Higher cigarette prices influence cigarette purchase patterns|journal=Tobacco Control|volume=14|issue=2|pages=86\u201392|accessdate=29 February 2016|doi=10.1136/tc.2004.008730|pmid=15791017|pmc=1748009|year=2005|last1=Hyland|first1=A.|last2=Bauer|first2=J.

United Kingdom and Ireland have limited the advertisement of tobacco at retailers<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www2.gov.scot/Topics/Health/Services/Smoking/TopicsHealthServicesSmoking|title=Tobacco Display Ban Guidance|last=Scottish Government|first=St Andrew's House|date=2013-01-21|website=www2.gov.scot|language=English|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref> <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.health-ni.gov.uk/publications/guidance-display-and-pricing-tobacco-products-northern-ireland|title=Guidance on the display and pricing of tobacco products in Northern Ireland {{!}} Department of Health|date=2015-08-25|website=Health|language=en|access-date=2019-11-27}}</ref>.

The evidence is as yet unclear as to the impact of such bans. \u00a0\n\nMany countries have a [[smoking age]]. In many countries, including the United States, most European Union member states, New Zealand, Canada, South Africa, Israel, India,<ref name=\":0\" /> Brazil, Chile, Costa Rica and Australia, it is illegal to sell tobacco products to minors and in the Netherlands, Austria, Belgium, Denmark and South Africa it is illegal to sell tobacco products to people under the age of 16. On 1 September 2007 the minimum age to buy tobacco products in Germany rose from 16 to 18, as well as in the United Kingdom where on 1 October 2007 it rose from 16 to 18.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tobacco18.co.uk/index.html|title=Tobacco Sales Law|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref> Underlying such laws is the belief that people should make an informed decision regarding the risks of tobacco use. These laws have a lax enforcement in some nations and states. In China, Turkey, and many other countries usually a child will have little problem buying tobacco products, because they are often told to go to the store to buy tobacco for their parents.\n\nSeveral countries such as [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], the Netherlands, Finland, Norway, Canada, Australia, Sweden, Portugal, [[Singapore]], Italy, [[Indonesia]], India, [[Lithuania]], [[Chile]], Spain, [[Iceland]], United Kingdom, [[Slovenia]], [[Turkey]] and [[Malta]] have legislated against smoking in public places, often including bars and restaurants. Restaurateurs have been permitted in some jurisdictions to build designated smoking areas (or to prohibit smoking). In the United States, many states prohibit smoking in restaurants, and some also prohibit smoking in bars. In provinces of Canada, smoking is illegal in indoor workplaces and public places, including bars and restaurants. As of 31 March 2008 Canada has introduced a smoke-free law ban in all public places, as well as within 10 metres of an entrance to any public place. In Australia, smoke-free laws vary from state to state. Currently, Queensland has completely smoke-free indoor public places (including workplaces, bars, pubs and eateries) as well as patrolled beaches and some outdoor public areas. There are, however, exceptions for designated smoking areas. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], smoking is restricted in railway stations, bus stops and tram stops as these are public locations where [[second-hand smoke]] can affect non-smokers waiting for public transport, and since 1 July 2007 is now extended to all indoor public places. In New Zealand and [[Brazil]], smoking is restricted in enclosed public places including bars, restaurants and pubs. Hong Kong restricted smoking on 1 January 2007 in the workplace, public spaces such as restaurants, karaoke rooms, buildings, and public parks (bars which do not admit minors were exempt until 2009). In [[Romania]] smoking is illegal in trains, metro stations, public institutions (except where designated, usually outside) and public transport.\nIn [[Germany]], additionally to smoking bans in public buildings and transports, an anti-smoking ordinance for bars and restaurants was implemented in late 2007. A study by the University of Hamburg (Ahlfeldt and Maennig 2010) demonstrates, that the smoking ban had, if any, only short run impacts on bar and restaurant revenues. In the medium and long run no negative effect was measurable. The results suggest either, that the consumption in bars and restaurants is not affected by smoking bans in the long run, or, that negative revenue impacts by smokers are compensated by increasing revenues through non-smokers.<ref>Ahlfeldt, G., Maennig, W. (2010), Impact of non-smoking ordinances on hospitality revenues: The case of Germany, in Journal of Economics and Statistics, 230(5), 506\u2013521; preliminary version in: Hamburg Contemporary Discussion Papers N\u00b0 26, http://www.uni-hamburg.de/economicpolicy/hced.html.</ref>\n\n===Ignition safety===\nAn indirect public health problem posed by cigarettes is that of accidental fires, usually linked with consumption of alcohol. Enhanced combustion using nitrates was traditionally used but cigarette manufacturers have been silent on this subject claiming at first that a safe cigarette was technically impossible, then that it could only be achieved by modifying the paper. Roll your own cigarettes contain no additives and are fire safe. Numerous [[fire safe cigarette]] designs have been proposed, some by tobacco companies themselves, which would extinguish a cigarette left unattended for more than a minute or two, thereby reducing the risk of fire. Among American tobacco companies, some have resisted this idea, while others have embraced it. [[RJ Reynolds]] was a leader in making prototypes of these cigarettes in 1983<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/newsReleaseDetails.asp?categoryid=488&itemId=36577&cookie%5Ftest=1|title=NFPA applauds Reynolds American Inc|accessdate=29 February 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130301031633/http://www.nfpa.org/newsReleaseDetails.asp?categoryid=488&itemId=36577&cookie%5Ftest=1|archivedate=1 March 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and will make all of their U.S. market cigarettes to be fire-safe by 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files//FSC/ReynoldsLetter.pdf|title=NFPA|accessdate=29 February 2016|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120013338/http://www.nfpa.org/assets/files//FSC/ReynoldsLetter.pdf|archivedate=20 November 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Philip Morris USA|Phillip Morris]] is not in active support of it.<ref name=\"letter_fire_safe_cigarettes\">{{cite web|url=http://firesafecigarettes.org/itemDetail.asp?categoryID=91&itemID=1370&URL=Letter%20to%20tobacco%20companies|title=Coalition for Fire-Safe Cigarettes|accessdate=29 February 2016}}</ref> [[Lorillard]] (purchased by [[RJ Reynolds]]), the US' 3rd-largest tobacco company, seems to be ambivalent.<ref name=\"letter_fire_safe_cigarettes\"/>\n\n==Gateway drug theory==\n{{Main|Tobacco and other drugs|Gateway drug theory}}\n\nThe relationship between tobacco and other drug use has been well-established, however the nature of this association remains unclear. The two main theories are the [[Gateway drug theory|phenotypic causation]] (gateway) model and the correlated liabilities model. The causation model argues that smoking is a primary influence on future drug use,<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = C. Merrill | first1 = J. | last2 = Kleber | first2 = H.

He is currently (2016) the team's sixth highest goal scorer.<ref name=fl>{{NeilBrownPlayers|player/trevorwhymark}}</ref>\n\n==Ipswich Town==\nWhymark started his football career with [[Anglian Combination]] team [[Diss Town]] whilst working his office job at a Diss builders' merchant and was signed by [[Sir Bobby Robson|Bobby Robson]] in 1969.<ref name=diss>[http://www.dissexpress.co.uk/sport/Football-England-and-Ipswich-star.3584681.jp Diss Express interview, 14/12/07]</ref>\n\nWhymark made his Ipswich League debut in February 1970 against [[Manchester City]]. In the remaining part of the season Whymark made six full and two substitute appearances, scoring his first and only goal in a vital 2\u20130 victory over fellow relegation strugglers Sunderland.\nThe following season Whymark only recorded eight full appearances with two substitute appearances and a single goal (in a 4\u20130 victory of Manchester United). It would appear this was a season cut short by injury as all of these games were played before October 10. It is also worth noting that following an injury to goalkeeper [[David Best (footballer)|David Best]] in a game against [[West Bromwich Albion]] Whymark came off the bench to play in goal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=149, 308|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1971/72 season Whymark was, bar an early substitute appearance, absent from the first team until February 1972. After that he had a run of 13 games, one as substitute where he netted four goals. Whymark had struck up a useful relationship with Leeds signing [[Rod Belfitt]] who had joined the club in November.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=152, 310|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 1972/1973 season Robson gave Whymark a chance to establish himself as Rod Belfitt's striking partner and the partnership scored 10 goals with Whymark contributing three. Surprisingly, given that Belfitt was Ipswich's top scorer, he was exchanged for young Everton striker [[David Johnson (footballer, born 1951)|David Johnson]] but this change suited Whymark who netted another eight league goals that season ending up as joint top scorer with attacking midfielder [[Bryan Hamilton]] on 11 goals. Whymark also scored five goals in Ipswich's successful [[Texaco Cup]] campaign including one in the second-leg of the final against local rivals Norwich City.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=157, 158, 310|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nFinishing fourth in Division 1 in the previous season meant that Ipswich could compete in the [[UEFA Cup]]. After a 1-0 aggregate first round victory against [[Real Madrid]], the undoubted highlight of the campaign was the first leg 4\u20130 victory over Italian team Lazio where Whymark scored all four goals.<ref name=\"diss\"/>\n\nBefore the return match he was presented with a trophy from some AS Roma supporters and this infuriated the volatile Lazio fans ensuring the second-leg in Italy was played in a hostile atmosphere. In a 2007 interview Whymark stated he had left the pitch carrying an iron bar for protection.<ref name=\"diss\"/>\n\nWhymark scored one further UEFA Cup goal against [[FC Twente|Twente Enscehde]].\n\nMeanwhile, in the league Whymark had another good season with 11 goals in 39 games plus a further goal in the League Cup.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=312|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nWhymark was joint top league scorer (with [[Bryan Hamilton]]) in the 1974/75 season with 10 goals from 40 games supplemented by an FA Cup and three League Cup goals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|page=313|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nThe following 1975/76 season Whymark was the 13 league and 2 UEFA cup goals.

In his place [[Paul Mariner]] was signed from [[Plymouth Argyle]] but on his debut against West Bromwich Albion it was Whymark who scored four goals in a 7\u20130 victory (Mariner also scored). This was the first time an Ipswich player had scored four goals in a home game. Whymark scored 14 league goals in 36 appearances during the 1976/77 season including a hat trick against Norwich City resulting in him being the top scorer again. In other competitions Whymark managed a goal in the FA Cup.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=171, 315|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nA serious knee injury limited Whymark to 19 league appearances with nine goals in 1977. This still meant he was Ipswich's second highest scorer behind Mariner and was supplemented by five League Cup goals in three games. In the UEFA Cup Whymark managed six appearances and six goals including his third instance of four goals in a game against [[Landskrona BoIS]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=172, 173, 316|edition=First}}</ref>\nIpswich won the FA Cup in 1978 but Whymark missed the game due to his knee injury and also didn't play in any of the rounds en route to the final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prideofanglia.com/page.php?page=playerAppearanceRecord&fullname=Trevor+Whymark&season=1977-78|title=Games played by Trevor Whymark in 1977-78 |publisher=prideofanglia.com|accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref>\nThe following 1978/79 season saw an injury ridden Whymark limited to eight league appearances with a single goal (against Liverpool).

In a 2007 interview Whymark spoke of his relationship with Bobby Robson:\n\"We didn't have the best of relationships on a personal level but I think he respected me for what I could do and how I did it. And I respected him for what he's achieved and how's it done, so there was a mutual respect in football terms. I never sat down and had a conversation with him about anything other than football.\" <ref name=\"diss\"/>\n\n==Vancouver Whitecaps==\nIn 1979 Whymark moved to play for [[Vancouver Whitecaps]] of the [[North American Soccer League]], and during his two seasons in Canada he scored 25 goals for the Whitecaps in 57 games.

He is currently (2016) the team's sixth highest goal scorer.<ref name=fl>{{NeilBrownPlayers|player/trevorwhymark}}</ref>\n\n==Ipswich Town==\nWhymark started his football career with [[Anglian Combination]] team [[Diss Town]] whilst working his office job at a Diss builders' merchant and was signed by [[Sir Bobby Robson|Bobby Robson]] in 1969.<ref name=diss>[http://www.dissexpress.co.uk/sport/Football-England-and-Ipswich-star.3584681.jp Diss Express interview, 14/12/07]</ref>\n\nWhymark made his Ipswich League debut in February 1970 against [[Manchester City]]. In the remaining part of the season Whymark made six full and two substitute appearances, scoring his first and only goal in a vital 2-0 victory over fellow relegation strugglers Sunderland.\nThe following season Whymark only recorded eight full appearances with two substitute appearances and a single goal (in a 4-0 victory of Manchester United). It would appear this was a season cut short by injury as all of these games were played before October 10. It is also worth noting that following an injury to goalkeeper [[David Best (footballer)|David Best]] in a game against [[West Bromwich Albion]] Whymark came off the bench to play in goal.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=149, 308|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1971/72 season Whymark was, bar an early substitute appearance, absent from the first team until February 1972. After that he had a run of 13 games, one as substitute where he netted four goals. Whymark had struck up a useful relationship with Leeds signing [[Rod Belfitt]] who had joined the club in November.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=152, 310|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of the 1972/1973 season Robson gave Whymark a chance to establish himself as Rod Belfitt's striking partner and the partnership scored 10 goals with Whymark contributing three. Surprisingly, given that Belfitt was Ipswich's top scorer, he was exchanged for young Everton striker [[David Johnson (footballer, born 1951)|David Johnson]] but this change suited Whymark who netted another eight league goals that season ending up as joint top scorer with attacking midfielder [[Bryan Hamilton]] on 11 goals. Whymark also scored five goals in Ipswich's successful [[Texaco Cup]] campaign including one in the second-leg of the final against local rivals Norwich City.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=157, 158, 310|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nFinishing fourth in Division 1 in the previous season meant that Ipswich could compete in the [[UEFA Cup]]. After a 1-0 aggregate first round victory against [[Real Madrid]], the undoubted highlight of the campaign was the first leg 4-0 victory over Italian team Lazio where Whymark scored all four goals.<ref name=\"diss\"/>\n\nBefore the return match he was presented with a trophy from some AS Roma supporters and this infuriated the volatile Lazio fans ensuring the second-leg in Italy was played in a hostile atmosphere. In a 2007 interview Whymark stated he had left the pitch carrying an iron bar for protection.<ref name=\"diss\"/>\n\nWhymark scored one further UEFA Cup goal against [[FC Twente|Twente Enscehde]].\n\nMeanwhile, in the league Whymark had another good season with 11 goals in 39 games plus a further goal in the League Cup.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=312|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nWhymark was joint top league scorer (with [[Bryan Hamilton]]) in the 1974/75 season with 10 goals from 40 games supplemented by an FA Cup and three League Cup goals.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|page=313|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nThe following 1975/76 season Whymark was the 13 league and 2 UEFA cup goals. For the second season in succession Whymark represented Ipswich in 40 (out of 42) league games.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|page=314|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nDuring the close season Whymark's striking partner David Jonson was transferred to Liverpool. In his place [[Paul Mariner]] was signed from [[Plymouth Argyle]] but on his debut against West Bromwich Albion it was Whymark who scored four goals in a 7-0 victory (Mariner also scored). This was the first time an Ipswich player had scored four goals in a home game. Whymark scored 14 league goals in 36 appearances during the 1976/77 season including a hat trick against Norwich City resulting in him being the top scorer again. In other competitions Whymark managed a goal in the FA Cup.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=171, 315|edition=First}}</ref>\n\nA serious knee injury limited Whymark to 19 league appearances with nine goals in 1977. This still meant he was Ipswich's second highest scorer behind Mariner and was supplemented by five League Cup goals in three games. In the UEFA Cup Whymark managed six appearances and six goals including his third instance of four goals in a game against [[Landskrona BoIS]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Eastwood|first1=John|last2=Moyse|first2=Tony|title=The men who made the town|date=1986|publisher=Almeida Books|location=Pentlow,UK|pages=172, 173, 316|edition=First}}</ref>\nIpswich won the FA Cup in 1978 but Whymark missed the game due to his knee injury and also didn't play in any of the rounds en route to the final.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.prideofanglia.com/page.php?page=playerAppearanceRecord&fullname=Trevor+Whymark&season=1977-78|title=Games played by Trevor Whymark in 1977-78 |publisher=prideofanglia.com|accessdate=29 September 2017}}</ref>\nThe following 1978/79 season saw an injury ridden Whymark limited to eight league appearances with a single goal (against Liverpool).

In a 2007 interview Whymark spoke of his relationship with Bobby Robson:\n\"We didn't have the best of relationships on a personal level but I think he respected me for what I could do and how I did it. And I respected him for what he's achieved and how's it done, so there was a mutual respect in football terms.

{"title_page": "Software framework", "text_new": "{{short description|Type of library that helps structure other software}}\n{{Redirect|Framework (computer science)||Framework (disambiguation)}}\nIn [[computer programming]], a '''software framework''' is an [[abstraction (computer science)|abstraction]] in which [[software]] providing generic functionality can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable [[software environment (disambiguation)|software environment]] that provides particular functionality as part of a larger [[software platform]] to facilitate development of [[software application]]s, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and [[application programming interface|application programming interfaces (APIs)]] that bring together all the different [[Software component|components]] to enable development of a [[software project|project]] or [[software system|system]].\n\nFrameworks have key distinguishing features that separate them from normal [[Library (computing)|libraries]]:\n\n* ''[[inversion of control]]'': In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications, the overall program's [[control flow|flow of control]] is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.<ref>{{citation|url= http://www.riehle.org/computer-science/research/dissertation/diss-a4.pdf|first= Dirk|last= Riehle|title= Framework Design: A Role Modeling Approach|publisher= [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]]|year= 2000|postscript= <!--none-->}}</ref>\n* ''[[extensibility]]'': A user can extend the framework \u2013 usually by selective overriding \u2013 or programmers can add specialized user code to provide specific functionality.\n* ''[[open/closed principle|non-modifiable framework code]]'': The framework code, in general, is not supposed to be modified, while accepting user-implemented extensions. In other words, users can extend the framework, but cannot modify its code.\n\n== Rationale ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2011}}\n{{Summarize section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Weasel|section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Essay-like|section|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\nThe designers of software frameworks aim to facilitate software developments by allowing designers and programmers to devote their time to meeting software requirements rather than  dealing with the more standard low-level details of providing a working system, thereby reducing overall development time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Framework |title=Framework |accessdate=15 December 2008 |work= DocForge}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>  For example, a team using a [[web framework]] to develop a banking website can focus on writing code particular to banking rather than the mechanics of request handling and [[state management]].\n\nFrameworks often add to the size of programs, a phenomenon termed \"[[code bloat]]\". Due to customer-demand driven applications needs, both competing and complementary frameworks sometimes end up in a product.  Further, due to the complexity of their APIs, the intended reduction in overall development time may not be achieved due to the need to spend additional time learning to use the framework; this criticism is clearly valid when a special or new framework is first encountered by development staff.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} If such a framework is not used in subsequent job taskings, the time invested in learning the framework can cost more than purpose-written code familiar to the project's staff; many programmers keep copies of useful boilerplate for common needs.\n\nHowever, once a framework is learned, future projects can be faster and easier to complete; the concept of a framework is to make a one-size-fits-all solution set, and with familiarity, code production should logically rise. There are no such claims made about the size of the code eventually bundled with the output product, nor its relative efficiency and conciseness. Using any library solution necessarily pulls in extras and unused extraneous assets unless the software is a compiler-object linker making a tight (small, wholly controlled, and specified) executable module.\n\nThe issue continues, but a decade-plus of industry experience{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} has shown that the most effective frameworks turn out to be those that evolve from re-factoring the common code of the enterprise, instead of using a generic \"one-size-fits-all\" framework developed by third parties for general purposes. An example of that would be how the user interface in such an application package as an office suite grows to have common look, feel, and data-sharing attributes and methods, as the once disparate bundled applications grow unified into a suite which is tighter and smaller; the newer/evolved suite can be a product that shares integral utility libraries and user interfaces.\n\nThis trend in the controversy brings up an important issue about frameworks. Creating a framework that is elegant, versus one that merely solves a problem, is still rather a craft than a science. \"Software [[elegance]]\" implies clarity, conciseness, and little waste (extra or extraneous functionality, much of which is user defined). For those frameworks that generate code, for example, \"elegance\" would imply the creation of code that is clean and comprehensible to a reasonably knowledgeable programmer (and which is therefore readily modifiable), versus one that merely generates correct code. The elegance issue is why relatively few software frameworks have stood the test of time: the best frameworks have been able to evolve gracefully as the underlying technology on which they were built advanced. Even there, having evolved, many such packages will retain legacy capabilities bloating the final software as otherwise replaced methods have been retained in parallel with the newer methods.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nSoftware frameworks typically contain considerable housekeeping and utility code in order to help bootstrap user applications, but generally focus on specific problem domains, such as:\n* Artistic drawing, music composition, and mechanical [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]<ref>{{citation|doi = 10.1145/98188.98197|last1 = Vlissides|first1 = J M|last2 = Linton|first2 = M A|year = 1990|title = Unidraw: a framework for building domain-specific graphical editors|journal = ACM Transactions on Information Systems|volume = 8|issue = 3|pages =237\u2013268|postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last = Johnson|first = R E|year = 1992|title = Documenting frameworks using patterns|publisher = ACM Press|journal = Proceedings of the Conference on Object Oriented Programming Systems Languages and Applications|pages = 63\u201376|postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref>\n* Financial modeling applications<ref>{{citation|last1 = Birrer|first1 = A|first2 = T|last2 = Eggenschwiler|year = 1993|work = Frameworks in the financial engineering domain: an experience report|publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]|title = Proceedings of the European conference on object-oriented programming|pages = 21\u201335}}</ref>\n* Earth system modeling applications<ref>{{citation|last1 = Hill|first1 = C|first2 = C|last2 = DeLuca|first3 = V|last3 = Balaji|first4 = M|last4 = Suarez|first5 = A|last5 = da Silva|title = Architecture of the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)|journal = Computing in Science and Engineering|volume = 6|year = 2004|pages = 18\u201328|postscript = <!--none-->|title-link = ESMF|doi = 10.1109/MCISE.2004.1255817}}</ref>\n* [[Decision support systems]]<ref>{{citation|last = Gachet|first = A|year = 2003|title = Software Frameworks for Developing Decision Support Systems \u2013 A New Component in the Classification of DSS Development Tools|journal = Journal of Decision Systems|volume = 12|issue = 3|pages = 271\u2013281|postscript = <!--none-->|doi = 10.3166/jds.12.271-280}}</ref>\n* Media playback and authoring\n* [[Ajax framework]] / [[JavaScript framework]]\n* [[Web framework]]\n* [[Middleware]]\n* [[Cactus Framework]] - High performance scientific computing.\n* [[Application framework]] - General GUI applications.\n* [[Enterprise Architecture framework]]\n* [[Oracle Application Development Framework]]\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nAccording to Pree,<ref>{{citation|title = Meta Patterns: A Means for Capturing the Essentials of Reusable Object-Oriented Design |author = Pree, W |journal = Proceedings of the 8th European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming |volume = 821 |pages = 150\u2013162 |year = 1994 |publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]|doi = 10.1007/BFb0052181 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.74.7935 |series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn = 978-3-540-58202-1 }}</ref> software frameworks consist of ''frozen spots'' and ''hot spots''.

It provides a standard way to build and deploy applications and is a universal, reusable [[software environment (disambiguation)|software environment]] that provides particular functionality as part of a larger [[software platform]] to facilitate development of [[software application]]s, products and solutions. Software frameworks may include support programs, compilers, code libraries, tool sets, and [[application programming interface|application programming interfaces (APIs)]] that bring together all the different [[Software component|components]] to enable development of a [[software project|project]] or [[software system|system]].\n\nFrameworks have key distinguishing features that separate them from normal [[Library (computing)|libraries]]:\n\n* ''[[inversion of control]]'': In a framework, unlike in libraries or in standard user applications, the overall program's [[control flow|flow of control]] is not dictated by the caller, but by the framework.<ref>{{citation|url= http://www.riehle.org/computer-science/research/dissertation/diss-a4.pdf|first= Dirk|last= Riehle|title= Framework Design: A Role Modeling Approach|publisher= [[ETH Zurich|Swiss Federal Institute of Technology]]|year= 2000|postscript= <!--none-->}}</ref>\n* ''[[extensibility]]'': A user can extend the framework \u2013 usually by selective overriding \u2013 or programmers can add specialized user code to provide specific functionality.\n* ''[[open/closed principle|non-modifiable framework code]]'': The framework code, in general, is not supposed to be modified, while accepting user-implemented extensions. In other words, users can extend the framework, but cannot modify its code.\n\n== Rationale ==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n{{More citations needed|section|date=April 2011}}\n{{Summarize section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Weasel|section|date=April 2020}}\n{{Essay-like|section|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\nThe designers of software frameworks aim to facilitate software developments by allowing designers and programmers to devote their time to meeting software requirements rather than  dealing with the more standard low-level details of providing a working system, thereby reducing overall development time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://docforge.com/wiki/Framework |title=Framework |accessdate=15 December 2008 |work= DocForge}}{{dead link|date=April 2020}}</ref>  For example, a team using a [[web framework]] to develop a banking website can focus on writing code particular to banking rather than the mechanics of request handling and [[state management]].\n\nFrameworks often add to the size of programs, a phenomenon termed \"[[code bloat]]\". Due to customer-demand driven applications needs, both competing and complementary frameworks sometimes end up in a product.  Further, due to the complexity of their APIs, the intended reduction in overall development time may not be achieved due to the need to spend additional time learning to use the framework; this criticism is clearly valid when a special or new framework is first encountered by development staff.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} If such a framework is not used in subsequent job taskings, the time invested in learning the framework can cost more than purpose-written code familiar to the project's staff; many programmers keep copies of useful boilerplate for common needs.\n\nHowever, once a framework is learned, future projects can be faster and easier to complete; the concept of a framework is to make a one-size-fits-all solution set, and with familiarity, code production should logically rise. There are no such claims made about the size of the code eventually bundled with the output product, nor its relative efficiency and conciseness. Using any library solution necessarily pulls in extras and unused extraneous assets unless the software is a compiler-object linker making a tight (small, wholly controlled, and specified) executable module.\n\nThe issue continues, but a decade-plus of industry experience{{citation needed|date=April 2011}} has shown that the most effective frameworks turn out to be those that evolve from re-factoring the common code of the enterprise, instead of using a generic \"one-size-fits-all\" framework developed by third parties for general purposes. An example of that would be how the user interface in such an application package as an office suite grows to have common look, feel, and data-sharing attributes and methods, as the once disparate bundled applications grow unified into a suite which is tighter and smaller; the newer/evolved suite can be a product that shares integral utility libraries and user interfaces.\n\nThis trend in the controversy brings up an important issue about frameworks. Creating a framework that is elegant, versus one that merely solves a problem, is still rather a craft than a science. \"Software [[elegance]]\" implies clarity, conciseness, and little waste (extra or extraneous functionality, much of which is user defined). For those frameworks that generate code, for example, \"elegance\" would imply the creation of code that is clean and comprehensible to a reasonably knowledgeable programmer (and which is therefore readily modifiable), versus one that merely generates correct code. The elegance issue is why relatively few software frameworks have stood the test of time: the best frameworks have been able to evolve gracefully as the underlying technology on which they were built advanced. Even there, having evolved, many such packages will retain legacy capabilities bloating the final software as otherwise replaced methods have been retained in parallel with the newer methods.\n\n== Examples ==\n\nSoftware frameworks typically contain considerable housekeeping and utility code in order to help bootstrap user applications, but generally focus on specific problem domains, such as:\n* Artistic drawing, music composition, and mechanical [[Computer-aided design|CAD]]<ref>{{citation|doi = 10.1145/98188.98197|last1 = Vlissides|first1 = J M|last2 = Linton|first2 = M A|year = 1990|title = Unidraw: a framework for building domain-specific graphical editors|journal = ACM Transactions on Information Systems|volume = 8|issue = 3|pages =237\u2013268|postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref><ref>{{citation|last = Johnson|first = R E|year = 1992|title = Documenting frameworks using patterns|publisher = ACM Press|journal = Proceedings of the Conference on Object Oriented Programming Systems Languages and Applications|pages = 63\u201376|postscript = <!--none-->}}</ref>\n* Financial modeling applications<ref>{{citation|last1 = Birrer|first1 = A|first2 = T|last2 = Eggenschwiler|year = 1993|work = Frameworks in the financial engineering domain: an experience report|publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]|title = Proceedings of the European conference on object-oriented programming|pages = 21\u201335}}</ref>\n* Earth system modeling applications<ref>{{citation|last1 = Hill|first1 = C|first2 = C|last2 = DeLuca|first3 = V|last3 = Balaji|first4 = M|last4 = Suarez|first5 = A|last5 = da Silva|title = Architecture of the Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)|journal = Computing in Science and Engineering|volume = 6|year = 2004|pages = 18\u201328|postscript = <!--none-->|title-link = ESMF|doi = 10.1109/MCISE.2004.1255817}}</ref>\n* [[Decision support systems]]<ref>{{citation|last = Gachet|first = A|year = 2003|title = Software Frameworks for Developing Decision Support Systems \u2013 A New Component in the Classification of DSS Development Tools|journal = Journal of Decision Systems|volume = 12|issue = 3|pages = 271\u2013281|postscript = <!--none-->|doi = 10.3166/jds.12.271-280}}</ref>\n* Media playback and authoring\n* [[Ajax framework]] / [[JavaScript framework]]\n* [[Web framework]]\n* [[Middleware]]\n* [[Cactus Framework]] - High performance scientific computing.\n* [[Application framework]] - General GUI applications.\n* [[Enterprise Architecture framework]]\n* [[Oracle Application Development Framework]]\n\n== Architecture ==\n\nAccording to Pree,<ref>{{citation|title = Meta Patterns: A Means for Capturing the Essentials of Reusable Object-Oriented Design |author = Pree, W |journal = Proceedings of the 8th European Conference on Object-Oriented Programming |volume = 821 |pages = 150\u2013162 |year = 1994 |publisher = [[Springer-Verlag]]|doi = 10.1007/BFb0052181 |citeseerx = 10.1.1.74.7935 |series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science |isbn = 978-3-540-58202-1 }}</ref> software frameworks consist of ''frozen spots'' and ''hot spots''.
