He was succeeded, as national team captain, by his Ak Bars team mate [[Ilya Nikulin]], in 2012.\n\n==Playing career==\nAs a youth, Morozov played in the 1991 [[Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament]] with a [[minor ice hockey]] team from [[Moscow]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.publicationsports.com/ressources/files/439/Joueurs_Pro.pdf|title=Pee-Wee players who have reached NHL or WHA|year=2018|website=Quebec International Pee-Wee Hockey Tournament|access-date=2019-02-01}}</ref>\n\n===Pittsburgh Penguins===\nMorozov was drafted in the first round, 24th overall, by the Pittsburgh Penguins in the [[1995 NHL Entry Draft]].<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.hockey-reference.com/players/m/morozal01.html |title = Aleksey Morozov |publisher = Hockey Reference.com |accessdate= 2010-04-17}}</ref> After being drafted, he remained in [[Russia]] and did not join the Penguins until the [[1997\u201398 NHL season]]. Morozov began his career much like Pittsburgh legend [[Mario Lemieux]], scoring on his first shot on his first shift of his first game as a Penguin. He played seven seasons for the Penguins, totaling 451 games, 84 goals, and 219 points.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nIn his seven-year NHL career, Morozov earned the nickname ''The Devil Killer'' for his notorious success against the [[New Jersey Devils]].<ref name=express>{{cite web|url=http://english.sport-express.ru/stars/14_54/ |title=Russian Sport Stars Morozov Alexi Ice Hockey |publisher=Sports Express.ru |accessdate=2010-04-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719090101/http://english.sport-express.ru/stars/14_54/ |archivedate=2011-07-19 }}</ref> In fact, New Jersey goaltender [[Martin Brodeur]] in an interview before a Penguins/Devils game on Fox Sports Net jokingly stated that he had nightmares of Morozov each night before his club would play the Penguins. Brodeur also stated in an interview with [[ESPN]]'s [[Dan Patrick]] that Morozov is the player that he would not like to see coming in on him on a breakaway adding \" The kid's got probably over 25 percent of his career goals on me. It's unbelievable.\" when asked to explain Morozov's success against him Brodeur added \" I don't know. If you figure it out, please tell me. When he shoots the puck, I never catch it really clean. When he's going to make a pass, I think he's shooting. When he's shooting, I think he's making a pass. The guy's in my kitchen. He's in my head. I can't get rid of him.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://a.espncdn.com/talent/danpatrick/s/2002/0220/1337210.html |title = Outtakes with Martin Brodeur |publisher = ESPN.com |accessdate= 2010-04-17}}</ref> He also won an Olympic Silver Medal on the 1998 Russian Olympic Team during his rookie year with the Penguins. Despite these successes, Morozov never fully developed into the player he had the potential to be as he played a majority of his first few seasons in the NHL on the third and fourth lines due to the tremendous depth of a talent laden Penguins team that included stars such as [[Mario Lemieux]], [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr]], [[Alexei Kovalev]], [[Martin Straka]] and [[Robert Lang (ice hockey)|Robert Lang]] among others.<ref name=express/>\n\nHe finally got his chance on the starting line during the 2002\u201303 season and the KLM line of Kovalev, Lemieux and Morozov led the Penguins to a top three record in the conference the first third of the season before being dismantled by injuries and trades. After bursting onto the scene with 25 points in 27 games, Morozov suffered a fractured wrist by a crushing hit that ended his season<ref name=express/> and Lemieux became bogged down by back problems which forced him to call it a year. Kovalev was later traded at the [[NHL trade deadline]] to the [[New York Rangers]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe next season saw Morozov off to a slow start, mainly due to injury and the lack of talent on a young Penguins team. However, down the stretch of the 2003\u201304 season, Morozov was instrumental to the Penguins late season success, leading the team with five game-winning goals, including two in the final three games of the season as well as netting 20 points in the final 15 games. He would also finish the season leading all Penguins forwards in points.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Ak Bars Kazan===\n[[File:Ak-bars11m.jpg|thumb|Morozov with Ak Bars Kazan in 2011\u201312]]\nDuring the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout]], Morozov went back to Russia to hone his skills and play for the [[Ak Bars Kazan]]<ref name=express/> of the [[Russian Superleague]] (RSL), for whom he has played since. He would see significant ice-time on a talent laden Ak-Bars team that included NHL stars such as [[Vincent Lecavalier]], [[Dany Heatley]], [[Ilya Kovalchuk]], [[Brad Richards]] and [[Nik Antropov]]. Despite these marquee NHL names, it would be Morozov who would go on to lead the club in scoring with 46 points.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====2005\u201306 season====\nWith the NHL's future still up in the air, Morozov signed a one-year contract with Kazan in hopes to build upon his previous season's success. The 2005\u201306 season proved a great one for Morozov, where he finished the regular season leading the league in goals (23) and being second in points (49) after [[Sergei Mozyakin]] (52) while leading Ak Bars to its first championship win in nearly ten years.<ref name=express/> He was instrumental in his team's long playoff run, amassing 26 points (13 goals, 13 assists) in just 13 games en route to Playoff MVP.<ref name=express/> He was also qualified for six other RSL league awards, two of which he won.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAs they built on their chemistry from the 2004\u201305 season that eventually led to dominance during the 2005\u201306 season, the Kazan line of [[Sergei Zinovjev]], [[Danis Zaripov]], and Morozov himself came to be known throughout the world as the ZZM Line. During the 2006 RSL playoff run, the ZZM Line amassed 51 points in just 13 games. Although they would only see one more full season together after 2005\u201306 due to injuries, the ZZM Line has been widely regarded as the best European line produced since the Cold War Era for their championship style of play leading Ak-Bars to one RSL championship, one KHL championship, one European Cup Championship, and Team Russia to two Gold Medal World Championships.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe off-season choice of whether to remain in the RSL or return to the NHL was a very difficult one for Morozov, as he wanted to join his compatriots [[Evgeni Malkin]] and [[Alexander Semin]] in the NHL but he also had a great relationship and close ties with Ak Bars. However, in the end, Morozov chose to sign an undisclosed contract to stay with his Russian club in hopes of winning back-to-back championships.<ref name=express/>\n\n====2006\u201307====\nWhen the regular season ended, Morozov led the league and established new Super League record in points (83)<ref name=express/> as Ak Bars Kazan had a league leading 119 points and well on the way to a second straight championship. He became the first and only player in the history of the RSL to top the eighty points in a season and his 83 points broke the old record of 79 held by [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]]. This is a record that will stand the test of time as in just two more years the RSL would be replaced by a greater league spanning four countries. After quickly dispatching of [[Metallurg Novokuznetsk]] in the opening round in three games, Ak Bars then defeated [[Atlant Moscow Oblast|Khimik Moscow Oblast]] and [[HC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] in four games each to advance to the finals to face [[Metallurg Magnitogorsk]]. In a final decisive game five, Ak Bars would come up short losing the final game by the score of 2\u20131. Despite not matching his stellar numbers of the 2005\u201306 season, Morozov finished the playoffs with a league leading 15 assists in 14 games.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) [[IIHF European Champions Cup|European Championship Cup (ECC)]] in January 2007, Morozov earned the titles of best forward and MVP as he led Ak Bars to the championship<ref name=express/> by defeating the [[SM-liiga]] club [[HPK]] 6\u20130, reaffirming Russian dominance at the tournament.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nShortly after the 2006\u201307 RSL season ended, Morozov was chosen to represent Russia as an Alternate Captain at the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|International Hockey World Championship]] (IHWC). Despite missing two games to a minor knee injury, in just seven games he finished first in goals with eight while finishing second in points as well as capturing the title of best forward at the tournament.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====2007\u201308====\nThe following and final RSL season proved another successful one for Morozov as he continued his dominance of the league by finishing in the tops in scoring and leading Ak Bars to the playoffs once again but would come up one game and one goal short of the finals in another heartbreaking 4\u20133 loss to Salavat Yulaev Ufa. The 2007\u201308 RSL season would be the last in the league's history, as it would be replaced by the newly formed [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) at the start of the 2008\u201309 season. The KHL comprised the 20 current teams from the RSL, as well as [[Avtomobilist Ekaterinburg]] of the [[Vysshaya Liga (ice hockey)|Vysshaya Liga]], [[Barys Astana]] from [[Kazakhstan]], [[HC Dynamo Minsk|Dynamo Minsk]] from [[Belarus]], as well as a team from [[Latvia]] based in [[Riga]] known as [[Dinamo Riga]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDue to his previous year's success with the [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russian national team]] at the 2007 World Championship, Morozov was chosen as [[captain (ice hockey)|Captain]] of the 2008 squad. With Morozov in the lineup the previous year, Russia went undefeated until he suffered a knee injury and the 2007 squad without their alternate captain would finish 1\u20131 and fall short of the Gold once again. However, with Morozov as their captain and in the lineup, Russia would go undefeated once again and capture the Gold by defeating Canada in a thrilling overtime contest 5\u20134. The gold medal score was Russia's first in 15 years and would be Russia's 24th overall, tying Canada for the most gold medals by any county. The 2008 IIHF World Championship also marked 100 years of World Championship hockey.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====2008\u201309====\n[[File:Aleksey Morozov2.jpg|thumb|Morozov with the Russian team in a game versus the Czech Republic]]\nIn 2008, his Russian club [[Ak Bars Kazan]] joined the Kontinetal Hockey League. Although Morozov was limited to only 49 games due to a freak head-on collision with [[Atlant Moscow]] goaltender [[Ray Emery]], he finished second in scoring with 70 points (32 goals and 38 assists). Following the season's end, Ak Bars swept [[Barys Astana]] in the Round of 16 and defeat them in season series 3\u20130. In the quarterfinals they would face the talent-laden [[Avangard Omsk]] and dispatch them in a final decisive game five 3\u20132 in overtime.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nFor the semifinals and finals matches, the playoff series length was increased to seven games for the final four teams in it and in their semifinal match-up, Kazan defeated [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] 4\u20132 and would go on to face [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl]] in the finals, making it the third time in five years that Ak Bars has made it to the finals. Although Ak Bars would get off to a slow start, getting outscored in their first three games by a combined score of 9\u20134, including two shutout losses, they and captain Aleksey Morozov would turn it on when it mattered. Finding themselves down 3\u20132 in the series, Ak Bars would snatch game six away from Lokomotiv in overtime and in the final decisive game seven their captain provided all the offense the team needed as Morozov scored the lone goal in a 1\u20130 victory, making Kazan the first team to ever capture the [[Gagarin Cup]] and first-ever KHL champions.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDue to his incredible success in the KHL as well as his previous success in captaining Russia to a World Championship, Morozov was once again chosen as captain for the 2009 IHWC squad. He would not disappoint, as Russia would go on to steamroll their opponents in the opening rounds of play and would soon find themselves in a rematch of the previous year's championship game against Canada. In yet another exciting contest, Russia would once again capture the Gold by defeating Canada 2\u20131 giving them the most Gold Medals by any country with 25. From 2006 to 2009, Team Russia was a perfect 21\u20130 with Morozov in their lineup in World Championship hockey.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====2009\u201310====\nMorozov was chosen as [[captain (ice hockey)|Captain]] for [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Team Russia]] at the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2010 Winter Olympics]], as well as the flagbearer for the [[Russia at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Russian Olympic Team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvolympics.ca/hockey/news/newsid=38450.html?cid=rss |title=Morozov to carry Russian flag at Opening Ceremony |publisher=CTV Olympics.ca |date=2010-02-11 |author=Jamie Bell |accessdate=2010-04-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313003925/http://www.ctvolympics.ca/hockey/news/newsid%3D38450.html?cid=rss |archivedate=13 March 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite a talented roster, Team Russia would fall to eventual Olympic Gold champion Canada in the opening elimination round. As of 2010, Canada and Russia stand tied with the most gold medals of any ice hockey national team with 25 between Olympic and World Championship tournaments.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDespite the devastating Olympic loss, Morozov did not let it bother him on the ice as he led Ak-Bars to their second straight Gagarin Cup as KHL champions. The 2009\u201310 season was an up and down one for Morozov as he battle injuries down the stretch in the second half of the KHL season where he missed several key playoff games and even had to miss the 2010 World Championships, where Team Russia would lose for the first time in over 3 years without their Captain and have to settle for Silver.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe injury bug would plague Morozov down the stretch of Ak-Bars KHL playoff run as well; however, due in large part to his leadership on and off the ice, Ak-Bars would capture their second consecutive Gagarin Cup as KHL champions. This victory made Ak-Bars the first club in the KHL to not only win the Gagarin Cup but to win the trophy twice and back-to-back.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====2010\u20132013 seasons====\nThe 2010\u201311 season would prove another successful one for Morozov as he was amongst the KHL league leaders in points once more with 56; averaging over a point-per-game for the fourth and final time in his professional career. Although Ak-Bars failed to capture their third straight Gagarin Cup, Morozov had yet another successful playoff season with 5 goals, 9 points in just 9 games.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nMorozov strung together another excellent season during the 2011\u201312 campaign where he scored over 50 points for the sixth and final time in his professional ice hockey career and amassed over 20 goals for the tenth and final time in his professional career. Although Ak-Bars would bow out early in the KHL playoffs, Morozov scored 4 goals, 6 points in just 5 games cementing his place as one of league's best all-time clutch performers.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe 2012\u201313 season was a successful one for Ak-Bars as they enjoyed a long playoff run before falling one win shy of reaching the Gagarin Cup Finals for the first time since 2010 when they lost to [[Traktor Chelyabinsk]] in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Although they wouldn't capture their third Gagarin Cup, the Ak-Bars captain lead the way scoring an impressive 15 points in 18 games in his final season with the club.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===CSKA Moscow===\nIn May 2013, it was announced that Morozov had signed a two-year contract with CSKA Moscow.<ref>{{cite web|title=KHL: Morozov Signs Two-Year Deal with CSKA |url=http://en.rsport.ru/hockey/20130513/662361860.html |website=rsport.ru |accessdate=August 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016185432/http://en.rsport.ru/hockey/20130513/662361860.html |archivedate=October 16, 2014 }}</ref>  He was named captain of the team later that summer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hockey: Radulov Stripped of CSKA Captaincy in Favor of Vet Morozov|url=http://en.ria.ru/sports/20130826/182977283/Hockey-Radulov-Stripped-of-CSKA-Captaincy-in-Favor-of-Vet.html|website=Ria.ru|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 2014, after battling through injuries during the 2013-2014 campaign, Morozov announced that he was retiring from professional ice hockey.<ref>{{cite web|last1=\u0428\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430|first1=\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430|title=rss \u0414\u0432\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u041c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b \u043e \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0445\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430|url=http://www.rsport.ru/hockey/20140824/767167466.html|website=rsport.ru|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> He leaves behind an impressive legacy as one of Russia's most gifted offensive players of all time as well as several Soviet/Russian league records from his years playing in the CIS, RSL, and KHL.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAmong these numerous records and awards are the Russian league record for most points in a season with 83 for his outstanding 2006-07 campaign as well as three championship titles, two of which he earned playoff MVP.

It's unbelievable.\" when asked to explain Morozov's success against him Brodeur added \" I don't know. If you figure it out, please tell me. When he shoots the puck, I never catch it really clean. When he's going to make a pass, I think he's shooting. When he's shooting, I think he's making a pass. The guy's in my kitchen. He's in my head. I can't get rid of him.\"<ref>{{cite web |url= http://a.espncdn.com/talent/danpatrick/s/2002/0220/1337210.html |title = Outtakes with Martin Brodeur |publisher = ESPN.com |accessdate= 2010-04-17}}</ref> He also won an Olympic Silver Medal on the 1998 Russian Olympic Team during his rookie year with the Penguins. Despite these successes, Morozov never fully developed into the player he had the potential to be as he played a majority of his first few seasons in the NHL on the third and fourth lines due to the tremendous depth of a talent laden Penguins team that included stars such as [[Mario Lemieux]], [[Jarom\u00edr J\u00e1gr]], [[Alexei Kovalev]], [[Martin Straka]] and [[Robert Lang (ice hockey)|Robert Lang]] among others.<ref name=express/>\n\nHe finally got his chance on the starting line during the 2002\u201303 season and the KLM line of Kovalev, Lemieux and Morozov led the Penguins to a top three record in the conference the first third of the season before being dismantled by injuries and trades. After bursting onto the scene with 25 points in 27 games, Morozov suffered a fractured wrist by a crushing hit that ended his season<ref name=express/> and Lemieux became bogged down by back problems which forced him to call it a year. Kovalev was later traded at the [[NHL trade deadline]] to the [[New York Rangers]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe next season saw Morozov off to a slow start, mainly due to injury and the lack of talent on a young Penguins team. However, down the stretch of the 2003\u201304 season, Morozov was instrumental to the Penguins late season success, leading the team with five game-winning goals, including two in the final three games of the season as well as netting 20 points in the final 15 games. He would also finish the season leading all Penguins forwards in points.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===Ak Bars Kazan===\n[[File:Ak-bars11m.jpg|thumb|Morozov with Ak Bars Kazan in 2011\u201312]]\nDuring the [[2004\u201305 NHL lockout]], Morozov went back to Russia to hone his skills and play for the [[Ak Bars Kazan]]<ref name=express/> of the [[Russian Superleague]] (RSL), for whom he has played since. He would see significant ice-time on a talent laden Ak-Bars team that included NHL stars such as [[Vincent Lecavalier]], [[Dany Heatley]], [[Ilya Kovalchuk]], [[Brad Richards]] and [[Nik Antropov]]. Despite these marquee NHL names, it would be Morozov who would go on to lead the club in scoring with 46 points.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====2005\u201306 season====\nWith the NHL's future still up in the air, Morozov signed a one-year contract with Kazan in hopes to build upon his previous season's success. The 2005\u201306 season proved a great one for Morozov, where he finished the regular season leading the league in goals (23) and being second in points (49) after [[Sergei Mozyakin]] (52) while leading Ak Bars to its first championship win in nearly ten years.<ref name=express/> He was instrumental in his teams long playoff run, amassing 26 points (13 goals, 13 assists) in just 13 games en route to Playoff MVP.<ref name=express/> He was also qualified for six other RSL league awards, two of which he won.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAs they built on their chemistry from the 2004\u201305 season that eventually led to dominance during the 2005\u201306 season, the Kazan line of [[Sergei Zinovjev]], [[Danis Zaripov]], and Morozov himself came to be known throughout the world as the ZZM Line. During the 2006 RSL playoff run, the ZZM Line amassed 51 points in just 13 games. Although they would only see one more full season together after 2005\u201306 due to injuries, the ZZM Line has been widely regarded as the best European line produced since the Cold War Era for their championship style of play leading Ak-Bars to one RSL championship, one KHL championship, one European Cup Championship, and Team Russia to two Gold Medal World Championships.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe off-season choice of whether to remain in the RSL or return to the NHL was a very difficult one for Morozov, as he wanted to join his compatriots [[Evgeni Malkin]] and [[Alexander Semin]] in the NHL but he also had a great relationship and close ties with Ak Bars. However, in the end, Morozov chose to sign an undisclosed contract to stay with his Russian club in hopes of winning back-to-back championships.<ref name=express/>\n\n====2006\u201307====\nWhen the regular season ended, Morozov led the league and established new Super League record in points (83)<ref name=express/> as Ak Bars Kazan had a league leading 119 points and well on the way to a second straight championship. He became the first and only player in the history of the RSL to top the eighty points in a season and his 83 points broke the old record of 79 held by [[Sergei Makarov (ice hockey)|Sergei Makarov]]. This is a record that will stand the test of time as in just two more years the RSL would be replaced by a greater league spanning four countries. After quickly dispatching of [[Metallurg Novokuznetsk]] in the opening round in three games, Ak Bars then defeated [[Atlant Moscow Oblast|Khimik Moscow Oblast]] and [[HC CSKA Moscow|CSKA Moscow]] in four games each to advance to the finals to face [[Metallurg Magnitogorsk]]. In a final decisive game five, Ak Bars would come up short losing the final game by the score of 2\u20131. Despite not matching his stellar numbers of the 2005\u201306 season, Morozov finished the playoffs with a league leading 15 assists in 14 games.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDuring the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF) [[IIHF European Champions Cup|European Championship Cup (ECC)]] in January 2007, Morozov earned the titles of best forward and MVP as he led Ak Bars to the championship<ref name=express/> by defeating the [[SM-liiga]] club [[HPK]] 6\u20130, reaffirming Russian dominance at the tournament.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nShortly after the 2006\u201307 RSL season ended, Morozov was chosen to represent Russia as an Alternate Captain at the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|International Hockey World Championship]] (IHWC). Despite missing two games to a minor knee injury, in just seven games he finished first in goals with eight while finishing second in points as well as capturing the title of best forward at the tournament.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====2007\u201308====\nThe following and final RSL season proved another successful one for Morozov as he continued his dominance of the league by finishing in the tops in scoring and leading Ak Bars to the playoffs once again but would come up one game and one goal short of the finals in another heartbreaking 4\u20133 loss to Salavat Yulaev Ufa. The 2007\u201308 RSL season would be the last in the league's history, as it would be replaced by the newly formed [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) at the start of the 2008\u201309 season. The KHL comprised the 20 current teams from the RSL, as well as [[Avtomobilist Ekaterinburg]] of the [[Vysshaya Liga (ice hockey)|Vysshaya Liga]], [[Barys Astana]] from [[Kazakhstan]], [[HC Dynamo Minsk|Dynamo Minsk]] from [[Belarus]], as well as a team from [[Latvia]] based in [[Riga]] known as [[Dinamo Riga]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDue to his previous year's success with the [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Russian national team]] at the 2007 World Championship, Morozov was chosen as [[captain (ice hockey)|Captain]] of the 2008 squad. With Morozov in the lineup the previous year, Russia went undefeated until he suffered a knee injury and the 2007 squad without their alternate captain would finish 1\u20131 and fall short of the Gold once again. However, with Morozov as their captain and in the lineup, Russia would go undefeated once again and capture the Gold by defeating Canada in a thrilling overtime contest 5\u20134. The gold medal score was Russia's first in 15 years and would be Russia's 24th overall, tying Canada for the most gold medals by any county. The 2008 IIHF World Championship also marked 100 years of World Championship hockey.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====2008\u201309====\n[[File:Aleksey Morozov2.jpg|thumb|Morozov with the Russian team in a game versus the Czech Republic]]\nIn 2008, his Russian club [[Ak Bars Kazan]] joined the Kontinetal Hockey League. Although Morozov was limited to only 49 games due to a freak head-on collision with [[Atlant Moscow]] goaltender [[Ray Emery]], he finished second in scoring with 70 points (32 goals and 38 assists). Following the season's end, Ak Bars swept [[Barys Astana]] in the Round of 16 and defeat them in season series 3\u20130. In the quarterfinals they would face the talent-laden [[Avangard Omsk]] and dispatch them in a final decisive game five 3\u20132 in overtime.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nFor the semifinals and finals matches, the playoff series length was increased to seven games for the final four teams in it and in their semifinal match-up, Kazan defeated [[HC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] 4\u20132 and would go on to face [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl]] in the finals, making it the third time in five years that Ak Bars has made it to the finals. Although Ak Bars would get off to a slow start, getting outscored in their first three games by a combined score of 9\u20134, including two shutout losses, they and captain Aleksey Morozov would turn it on when it mattered. Finding themselves down 3\u20132 in the series, Ak Bars would snatch game six away from Lokomotiv in overtime and in the final decisive game seven their captain provided all the offense the team needed as Morozov scored the lone goal in a 1\u20130 victory, making Kazan the first team to ever capture the [[Gagarin Cup]] and first-ever KHL champions.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDue to his incredible success in the KHL as well as his previous success in captaining Russia to a World Championship, Morozov was once again chosen as captain for the 2009 IHWC squad. He would not disappoint, as Russia would go on to steamroll their opponents in the opening rounds of play and would soon find themselves in a rematch of the previous year's championship game against Canada. In yet another exciting contest, Russia would once again capture the Gold by defeating Canada 2\u20131 giving them the most Gold Medals by any country with 25. From 2006 to 2009, Team Russia was a perfect 21\u20130 with Morozov in their lineup in World Championship hockey.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====2009\u201310====\nMorozov was chosen as [[captain (ice hockey)|Captain]] for [[Russia men's national ice hockey team|Team Russia]] at the [[Ice hockey at the 2010 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|2010 Winter Olympics]], as well as the flagbearer for the [[Russia at the 2010 Winter Olympics|Russian Olympic Team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctvolympics.ca/hockey/news/newsid=38450.html?cid=rss |title=Morozov to carry Russian flag at Opening Ceremony |publisher=CTV Olympics.ca |date=2010-02-11 |author=Jamie Bell |accessdate=2010-04-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313003925/http://www.ctvolympics.ca/hockey/news/newsid%3D38450.html?cid=rss |archivedate=13 March 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref> Despite a talented roster, Team Russia would fall to eventual Olympic Gold champion Canada in the opening elimination round. As of 2010, Canada and Russia stand tied with the most gold medals of any ice hockey national team with 25 between Olympic and World Championship tournaments.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDespite the devastating Olympic loss, Morozov did not let it bother him on the ice as he led Ak-Bars to their second straight Gagarin Cup as KHL champions. The 2009\u201310 season was an up and down one for Morozov as he battle injuries down the stretch in the second half of the KHL season where he missed several key playoff games and even had to miss the 2010 World Championships, where Team Russia would lose for the first time in over 3 years without their Captain and have to settle for Silver.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe injury bug would plague Morozov down the stretch of Ak-Bars KHL playoff run as well; however, due in large part to his leadership on and off the ice, Ak-Bars would capture their second consecutive Gagarin Cup as KHL champions. This victory made Ak-Bars the first club in the KHL to not only win the Gagarin Cup but to win the trophy twice and back-to-back.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n====2010\u20132013 seasons====\nThe 2010\u201311 season would prove another successful one for Morozov as he was amongst the KHL league leaders in points once more with 56; averaging over a point-per-game for the fourth and final time in his professional career. Although Ak-Bars failed to capture their third straight Gagarin Cup, Morozov had yet another successful playoff season with 5 goals, 9 points in just 9 games.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nMorozov strung together another excellent season during the 2011\u201312 campaign where he scored over 50 points for the sixth and final time in his professional ice hockey career and amassed over 20 goals for the tenth and final time in his professional career. Although Ak-Bars would bow out early in the KHL playoffs, Morozov scored 4 goals, 6 points in just 5 games cementing his place as one of league's best all-time clutch performers.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nThe 2012\u201313 season was a successful one for Ak-Bars as they enjoyed a long playoff run before falling one win shy of reaching the Gagarin Cup Finals for the first time since 2010 when they lost to [[Traktor Chelyabinsk]] in Game 7 of the Eastern Conference Finals. Although they wouldn't capture their third Gagarin Cup, the Ak-Bars captain lead the way scoring an impressive 15 points in 18 games in his final season with the club.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\n===CSKA Moscow===\nIn May 2013, it was announced that Morozov had signed a two-year contract with CSKA Moscow.<ref>{{cite web|title=KHL: Morozov Signs Two-Year Deal with CSKA |url=http://en.rsport.ru/hockey/20130513/662361860.html |website=rsport.ru |accessdate=August 24, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016185432/http://en.rsport.ru/hockey/20130513/662361860.html |archivedate=October 16, 2014 }}</ref>  He was named captain of the team later that summer.<ref>{{cite web|title=Hockey: Radulov Stripped of CSKA Captaincy in Favor of Vet Morozov|url=http://en.ria.ru/sports/20130826/182977283/Hockey-Radulov-Stripped-of-CSKA-Captaincy-in-Favor-of-Vet.html|website=Ria.ru|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn August 24, 2014, after battling through injuries during the 2013-2014 campaign, Morozov announced that he was retiring from professional ice hockey.<ref>{{cite web|last1=\u0428\u0438\u043b\u043e\u0432\u0430|first1=\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0430|title=rss \u0414\u0432\u0443\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0442\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0447\u0435\u043c\u043f\u0438\u043e\u043d \u043c\u0438\u0440\u0430 \u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u0435\u0439 \u041c\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0437\u043e\u0432 \u043e\u0431\u044a\u044f\u0432\u0438\u043b \u043e \u0437\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0438 \u043a\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0435\u0440\u044b \u0445\u043e\u043a\u043a\u0435\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430|url=http://www.rsport.ru/hockey/20140824/767167466.html|website=rsport.ru|accessdate=August 24, 2014}}</ref> He leaves behind an impressive legacy as one of Russia's most gifted offensive players of all time as well as several Soviet/Russian league records from his years playing in the CIS, RSL, and KHL.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nAmong these numerous records and awards are the Russian league record for most points in a season with 83 for his outstanding 2006-07 campaign as well as three championship titles, two of which he earned playoff MVP.

It took place on the same day as several other county borough elections in Wales and [[England]].\n\nThe previous elections to this one were [[1970 Cardiff City Council election|in May 1970]] and the next elections would be [[1972 Cardiff City Council election|in May 1972]]. The 1971 election would be the penultimate all-Cardiff election before the dissolution of the unitary authority and the creation of the new second-tier district authority of [[Cardiff City Council]] in 1974.  \n{{TOC right}}\n\nThe election saw the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] taking a significant number of seats back from the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]].\n\n==Background==\nCardiff County Borough Council had been created in 1889. Cardiff became a city in 1905. Elections to the local authority were held annually, though not all council seats were included in each contest, because each of the three councillors in each ward stood down for election in rotation.<ref>{{cite news|title=All eyes on Whitchutch and Rhiwbina - newcomers hold the key to power |work=South Wales Echo |date= 9 May 1967 |page=6 |quote=For to bring the election procedure into line with that in the city's other wards, whoever tops the poll in the two new wards goes to City Hall for a full three-year term.

In this way the added areas will in future elect one member every year from 1968.}}</ref> The councillors elected in 1971 would serve for less than three years, before the dissolution of the present Council in April 1974. \n\nThe local government elections took place in the context of an [[Edward Heath]]'s new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] UK government (which had been elected only 11 months previously) and rising prices and unemployment. <ref name=\"SWE Tories tumble\">{{cite news|author=Gordon Jackson |title=Labour joy as Tories tumble |work=[[South Wales Echo]] |date= 14 May 1971 |page=1 }}</ref>\n\n==Overview of the result==\n\nNineteen seats in 19 [[electoral wards]] were up for election in May 1971.

A methyl group is added to GAA from the amino acid methionine by the enzyme [[Guanidinoacetate N-methyltransferase|GAMT]], forming non-phosphorylated creatine. This is then released into the blood by the liver where it travels mainly to the muscle cells (95% of the body's creatine is in muscles), and to a lesser extent the brain, heart, and pancreas. Once inside the cells it is transformed into phosphocreatine by the enzyme complex [[creatine kinase]], which makes it able to donate its phosphate group to convert [[adenosine diphosphate]] (ADP) into [[adenosine triphosphate]] (ATP). This process is an important component of all vertebrates' bioenergetic systems. For instance, while the human body only produces 250g of ATP daily, it recycles its entire body weight in ATP each day through creatine phosphate. \n\nCreatine phosphate can be broken down into [[creatinine]], which is then excreted in the urine. A 70-kg man contains around 120g of creatine, with 40% being the unphosphorylated form and 60% as creatine phosphate. Of that amount, 1\u20132% is broken down and excreted each day as creatinine.\n\nPhosphocreatine is used intravenously in hospitals in some parts of the world for cardiovascular problems under the name Neoton, and also used by some professional athletes, as it is not a controlled substance.\n\n==Function==\nPhosphocreatine can anaerobically donate a phosphate group to [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]] to form [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] during the first two to seven seconds following an intense muscular or neuronal effort. {{Citation needed|reason=Timeframe of 2-7s not found in Schlattner's review article.|date=June 2017}} Conversely, excess [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] can be used during a period of low effort to convert [[creatine]] to phosphocreatine.
