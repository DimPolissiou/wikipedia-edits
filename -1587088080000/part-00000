A series of advertisements featuring [[George Plimpton]] were produced that demonstrated the superiority of the Intellivision's graphics and sound to those of the [[Atari 2600]], using side-by-side game comparisons.<ref name=\"Gamasutra\"/>  One of the slogans of the television advertisements stated that Intellivision was \"the closest thing to the real thing\"; one example in an advertisement compared golf games. The other console's games had a blip sound and cruder graphics, while the Intellivision featured a realistic swing sound and striking of the ball, and graphics that suggested a more 3D look. There was also an advertisement comparing the Atari 2600 to it, featuring the slogan \"I didn't know\". In its first year, Mattel sold out its initial 175,000 production run of Intellivision \"Master Components\".<ref name=timeline/> In 1981, over one million Intellivision consoles were sold, five times as many as in 1980.<ref name=\"csmonitor\">{{Cite news |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1982/0524/052434.html |title=Computerized games hit profits jackpot for Mattel company |last=Sklarewitz |first=Norman |date=1982-05-24 |work=Christian Science Monitor |access-date=2019-03-16 |issn=0882-7729}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Sears-Tele-Games-Super-Video-Arcade-Intellivision-Console-FL.jpg|link=File:Sears-Tele-Games-Super-Video-Arcade-Intellivision-Console-FL.jpg|thumb|250px|right|alt=Gray rectangular console with two controllers.

It provides two benefits:  reusable code that can effectively make a 4K cartridge an 8K game, and a [[software framework]] for new programmers to develop games more easily and quickly.  It also allows other programmers to more easily review and continue another's project.  Under the supervision of David Rolfe (APh) and graphics supplied by [[Mattel]] artist Dave James, APh was able to quickly create the Intellivision launch title library using mostly summer students.<ref name=lives_companies>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/people/companies.html Where Are They Now?] intellivisionlives.com</ref>  The drawback is that to be flexible and handle many different types of games the Exec runs less efficiently than a dedicated program.  Intellivision games that leverage the Exec run at a 20&nbsp;Hz [[frame rate]] instead of the 60&nbsp;Hz frame rate for which the Intellivision was designed.  Using the Exec framework is optional, but almost all Intellivision games released by Mattel Electronics are 20&nbsp;Hz.  The limited [[ROM cartridge|ROM]] space also meant there was no room for computer artificial intelligence and many early games required two players.\n\nInitially, all Intellivision games were programmed by an outside firm, APh Technological Consulting,<ref name=\"Gamasutra\"/> with 19 cartridges produced before Christmas 1980. Once the Intellivision project became successful, software development was brought in-house.  Mattel formed its own software development group and began hiring programmers.  The original five members of that Intellivision team were Mike Minkoff, Rick Levine, John Sohl, [[Don Daglow]], and manager Gabriel Baum. Levine and Minkoff, a long-time Mattel Toys veteran, both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team. During 1981 Mattel hired programmers as fast it could.  Early in 1982 Mattel Electronics relocated from Mattel headquarters to an unused industrial building.  Office renovation work happened as new staff moved in. To keep these programmers from being hired away by rival [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]], their identity and work location was kept a closely guarded secret. In public, the programmers were referred to collectively as the [[Blue Sky Rangers]].\n\nMost of the early games were based on traditional real-world concepts such as sports, with an emphasis on realism and depth of play within the technology of the day.  The Intellivision was not marketed as a toy; as such, games such as ''Sea Battle'' and ''B-17 Bomber'' are not made in a pick-up-and-play format which [[arcade game|arcade style]] games are.  Reading the instructions is often a prerequisite to play.  Every cartridge produced by Mattel Electronics included two plastic controller \"overlays\" to help navigate the 12 keypad buttons, although not every game made use of the keypad.  Mattel organized its games into networks: ''Major League Sports, Action, Strategy, Gaming, Children's Learning'' and later ''Space Action'' and ''Arcade''.  The network concept was dropped in 1983, as were the convenient gate-fold style boxes for storing the cartridge, instructions, and overlays.\n\nStarting in 1981 programmers looking for credit and royalties on sales began leaving both APh and Mattel Electronics to create Intellivision cartridges for third-party publishers.  They helped form [[Imagic]] in 1981 and in 1982 others joined [[Activision]] and Atari.  Cheshire Engineering was formed by a few senior APh programmers including David Rolfe (author of the Exec) and Tom Loughry, who had created one of the most popular Intellivision games ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Cloudy Mountain|Advanced Dungeons and Dragons]]'';<ref name=\"loughry\">{{cite web |last1=Goninon |first1=Mark |title=Where are they now? \u2013 Tom Loughry |url=https://www.choicestgames.com/2014/11/where-are-they-now-tom-loughry.html |website=Choicest Games |publisher=Choicest Games |accessdate=26 Nov 2014}}</ref> Cheshire created Intellivision games for Activision.  Third-party developers Activision, Imagic, and Coleco started producing Intellivision cartridges in 1982, and Atari, Parker Brothers, Sega, and Interphase followed in 1983.  The third-party developers, not having legal access to Exec knowledge, often bypassed the Exec framework to create smooth 30&nbsp;Hz and 60&nbsp;Hz Intellivision games such as ''The Dreadnaught Factor''.  Cheaper [[Read-only memory|ROM]] prices also allowed for larger games as 8K, 12K, and then 16K cartridges became common.  The first Mattel Electronics Intellivision game to run at 60&nbsp;Hz was ''Masters of the Universe'' in 1983.<ref>https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-koenig-71a50412/</ref>  Marketing dubbed the term \"Super Graphics\" on the game's packaging and marketing.\n\nMattel Electronics' team of programmers was diverse in experience and talent, which proved to be an advantage.  As competitors often depended on licensing well known [[trademark]]s to sell video games, Mattel focused on original ideas. Don Daglow was a key early programmer at Mattel and became director of Intellivision game development.  Daglow created [[Utopia (video game)|''Utopia'']], a precursor to the [[Construction and management simulation|sim genre]] and, with Eddie Dombrower, the ground breaking sports simulation [[Intellivision World Series Baseball|''World Series Major League Baseball'']]. Daglow was also involved with the popular Intellivision games ''Tron Deadly Discs'' and ''Shark! Shark!''.<ref name=\"gama_dd_art\">{{cite web |last1=Wallis |first1=Alistair |title=Playing Catch Up: Stormfront Studios' Don Daglow |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/102180/Column_Playing_Catch_Up_Stormfront_Studios_Don_Daglow.php |website=Gamasutra |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=19 Oct 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"gama_dd_int\">{{cite web |last1=Sheffield |first1=Brandon |last2=Frank |first2=Frank |title=From Intellivision To Today: Talking To Don Daglow |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112971/From_Intellivision_To_Today_Talking_To_Don_Daglow.php |website=Gamasutra |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=30 Jan 2009}}</ref> After Mattel Electronics closed in 1984, their programmers would go on to make significant contributions to the video game industry.

Bill Fisher, Steve Roney and Mike Breen founded [[Quicksilver Software]] and David Warhol founded [[Realtime Associates]].<ref name=lives_companies/>\n\n===Keyboard Component===\n[[File:Intellivision - trojandan 14871699 - white background.jpg|thumb|Intellivision \u2013 trojandan 14871699 \u2013 white background|The ''Keyboard Component'' code-named the ''Blue Whale'' also known as the ''Intelliputer''<ref name=KC/>]]\nFrom the beginning, Intellivision's packaging and promotional materials, as well as television commercials, promised the addition of a soon-to-be-available accessory called the \"Keyboard Component\".  The Intellivision was designed as a modular home computer.  The ''Master Component'' could be purchased as a stand-alone video game system and the ''Keyboard Component'' could be added, providing the computer keyboard and tape drive.  Not meant to be a hobbyist or business computer, the Intellivision home computer was meant to run pre-programmed software and bring \"data flow\" ([[Videotex]]) into the home.<ref name=papaint_his/>\n\nThe Keyboard Component added an 8-bit [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] processor making the Intellivision a dual processor computer.  It had 16K 10-bit shared RAM that could load and execute both Intellivision [[General Instrument CP1600|CP1610]] and 6502 program code from tape; a large amount as typical cartridges of the day were 4K.  The cassettes have two tracks of digital data and two tracks of analog audio completely controlled by the computer.  Two tracks are read only for the software, and two tracks for user data.  The tape-drive was block addressed with high speed indexing.  A high resolution 40x24 monochrome text display could overlay regular Intellivision graphics.  There was an input for a microphone and two additional expansion ports for peripherals and [[random-access memory|RAM]] expansion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.intellivision.us/index.php?title=Keyboard_Component|title=Keyboard Component \u2013 Intellivision Wiki|website=wiki.intellivision.us}}</ref>  The [[Microsoft BASIC]] programming cartridge used one of these ports.  Expanded memory cartridges could support 1000 8KB pages.  A third pass-through cartridge port was for regular Intellivision cartridges.  It uses the Intellivision's power supply.  A 40-column thermal printer was available, and a telephone [[modem]] was planned along with voice synthesis and voice recognition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionbrasil.com.br/docs/catalogos/1980-81_Mattel-EUA_00073240-B.pdf |title=IntelliVision |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2019-07-23}}</ref>\n\nDavid Rolfe of APh wrote a control program for the Keyboard Component called ''PicSe'' (Picture Sequencer) specifically for the development of multimedia applications. PicSe synchronized the graphics and analog audio while concurrently saving/loading data to/from tape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gooddealgames.com/interviews/int_rolfe.html|title=Good Deal Games \u2013 Classic Videogame Games INTERVIEW \u2013 David Rolfe|website=www.gooddealgames.com}}</ref>  Productivity software for home finances, personal improvement, and [[educational software|self education]] were planned.  Subject experts were consulted and their voices recorded and used in the software.\n\nThree applications using the PicSe system were released on cassette tape: \n*''Conversational French''\n*''Jack Lalanne's Physical Conditioning'' \n*''Spelling Challenge''\n\nFive [[Microsoft BASIC|BASIC]] applications were released on tape:  ''Programs written in BASIC did not have access to Intellivision graphics and were sold at a lower price.''\n*''Family Budgeting''\n*''Geography Challenge''\n*''Crosswords I, II, and III''\n\nWhile the Keyboard Component was an ambitious piece of engineering for its time it was repeatedly delayed as the engineers tried to reduce manufacturing costs.  In August 1979 the Intellivision Keyboard Component, in [[breadboard]] form, was successfully entered into the [[Sears]] Market Research Program.  In December 1979 Mattel had production design working units but decided on a significant internal design change to consolidate circuit boards.  In September 1980 it was test marketed in Fresno, California but without software, except for the BASIC programming cartridge.  In the fall of 1981 design changes were finally implemented and the ''Keyboard Component'' was released at $600<ref name=timeline/> in Seattle and New Orleans only.<ref name=papaint_his/>  Those that complained in writing could buy a Keyboard Component directly from Mattel.  The printer, a rebadged Alphacom Sprinter 40,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papaintellivision.com/hwKeyboard.php|title=Keyboard Component Hardware \u2013 Papa Intellivision|website=papaintellivision.com}}</ref> was only available by mail order.\n\nThe keyboard component's repeated delays became so notorious around Mattel headquarters that comedian [[Jay Leno]], when performing at Mattel's 1981 Christmas party, got his biggest titter of the evening with the line: \"You know what the three big lies are, don't you? 'The check is in the mail,' 'I'll still respect you in the morning,' and 'The keyboard will be out in spring.'\"<ref name=KC>{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/keyboard_tech.html | publisher = Intellivision Lives | title = Keyboard Component}}</ref>\n\nComplaints from consumers who had chosen to buy the Intellivision specifically on the promise of a \"coming soon\" personal-computer upgrade, eventually caught the attention of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), who started investigating Mattel Electronics for fraud and false advertising. In mid-1982 the FTC ordered Mattel to pay a monthly fine (said to be $10,000) until the promised computer upgrade was in full retail distribution.<ref name=KC /> To protect themselves from the ongoing fines, the Keyboard Component was officially canceled in August 1982 and the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) module offered up in its place.  Part of Mattel's settlement with the FTC involved offering to buy back all of the existing Keyboard Components from customers. Mattel provided a full refund but without a receipt paid $550 for the Keyboard Component, $60 for the BASIC cartridge, and $30 for each cassette software.<ref name=dereinte>{{cite web|url=http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/intv/jzintv-1.0-beta3/doc/De_Re_Intellivision/dri_1.txt|title=De Re Intellivision|publisher=}}</ref>  Any customer who opted to keep theirs was required to sign a waiver with the understanding that no more software would be written for the system and absolved Mattel of any future responsibility for technical support.<ref name=lives_hw>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/index.html] intellivisionlives.com</ref> They were also compensated with $1000 worth of Mattel Electronics products.<ref name=dereinte />\n\nWhile approximately 4,000 Keyboard Components were manufactured, it is not clear how many of them actually found their way into the hands of Intellivision customers. Today, very few of them still exist.  Many of the units were dismantled for parts.  Others were used by Mattel Electronics programmers as part of their development system.  A Keyboard Component could be interfaced with an Intellivision development system in place of the hand-built Magus board [[RAM]] cartridge.  Data transfer to the Keyboard Component RAM had to be done serially and was slower compared with the Magus board parallel interface.<ref name=KC/>\n\nThe keyboard component debacle was ranked as No. 11 on ''[[GameSpy]]''{{'}}s \"25 dumbest moments in gaming\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/index14.shtml | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081231052715/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/index14.shtml | archivedate = December 31, 2008 | publisher = GameSpy | title = Dumbest Moments}}</ref>\n\n===Entertainment Computer System (ECS)===\n{{Main article|Entertainment Computer System}}\nIn mid-1981, Mattel's upper management was becoming concerned that the keyboard component division would never be able to produce a sellable product. As a result, Mattel Electronics set up a competing internal engineering team whose stated mission was to produce an inexpensive add-on called the \"Basic Development System\", or BDS, to be sold as an educational device to introduce kids to the concepts of computer programming.\n\nThe rival BDS engineering group, who had to keep the project's real purpose a secret among themselves, fearing that if David Chandler, the head of the keyboard component team, found out about it he would use his influence to end the project, eventually came up with a much less expensive alternative. Originally dubbed the \"Lucky\", from LUCKI: Low User-Cost Keyboard Interface, it lacked many of the sophisticated features envisioned for the original keyboard component. Gone, for example, was the 16K (8MB max) of RAM, the secondary CPU, and high resolution text; instead, the ECS offered a mere 2KB RAM expansion, a built-in BASIC that was marginally functional, plus a much-simplified cassette and printer interface.\n\nUltimately, this fulfilled the original promises of turning the Intellivision into a computer, making it possible to write programs and store them to tape, and interfacing with a printer well enough to allow Mattel to claim that they had delivered the promised computer upgrade and stop the FTC's mounting fines. It even offered, via an additional sound chip ([[General Instrument AY-3-8910|AY-3-8917]]) inside the ECS module and an optional 49-key music synthesizer keyboard, the possibility of turning the Intellivision into a multi-voice synthesizer which could be used to play or learn music.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, the LUCKI, now renamed the Entertainment Computer System (ECS), was presented at the annual sales meeting, officially ending the ill-fated keyboard component project. A new advertising campaign was aired in time for the 1982 Christmas season, and the ECS itself was shown to the public at the January 1983 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in Las Vegas. A few months later, the ECS hit the market, and the FTC agreed to drop the $10K per day fines.\n\nBy the time the ECS made its retail debut as the Intellivision Computer Module, an internal shake-up at the top levels of Mattel Electronics' management had caused the company's focus to shift away from hardware add-ons in favor of software, and the ECS received very little in terms of furthering the marketing push. Further hardware developments, including a planned Program Expander that would have added another 16K of RAM and a more intricate, fully featured Extended-BASIC to the system, were halted.  In the end a half-dozen software titles were released for the ECS; a few more were completed but not released.\n\nThe ECS also offered four player game-play with the optional addition of two extra hand controllers.  Four player games were in development when Mattel Electronics closed in 1984.  ''World Cup Soccer'' was later completed and released in 1985 by Dextel in Europe and then INTV Corporation in North America.  The documentation does not mention it but when the ECS Computer Adapter is used, ''World Cup Soccer'' can be played with one to four players, or two players cooperatively against the computer.\n\n===Intellivoice===\n{{Main article|Intellivoice}}\n[[File:Intellivoice.jpg|link=File:Intellivoice.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Brown rectangular box with a volume knob|The [[Intellivoice]] add-on]]\nIn 1982 Mattel introduced a new peripheral for the Intellivision:  the ''Intellivoice Voice Synthesis Module''.  A [[speech synthesis|speech synthesizer]] which produces speech with compatible cartridges. The Intellivoice was original in two respects: human sounding male and female voices with distinct accents, and the speech-supporting games were designed with speech being an integral part of the game-play.\n\nLike the Intellivision chip-set, the Intellivoice chip-set was developed by [[General Instrument]].  The [[General Instrument SP0256|SP0256-012]] orator [[Integrated circuit|chip]] has 2KB [[Read-only memory|ROM]] inside, and is used to store the speech for numerical digits, some common words, and the phrase \"Mattel Electronics presents\".  Speech can also be processed from the Intellivoice's SP650 buffer chip,  stored and loaded from cartridge memory.  That buffer chip has its own [[Input/output|I/O]] and the Intellivoice has a 30-pin expansion port under a removable top plate.  Mattel Electronics planned to use that connector for wireless hand controllers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/voice_tech.html#systag|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Intellivoice Module|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>\n\nMattel Electronics built a state of the art voice processing lab to produce the phrases used in Intellivoice games.  However, the amount of speech that could be compressed into an 8K or 12K cartridge and still leave room for a game was limited.  Intellivoice cartridges ''Space Spartans'' and ''B-17 Bomber'' did sell about 300,000 copies each, priced a few dollars more than regular Intellivision cartridges.  However, at $79 the Intellivoice did not sell as well as Mattel expected, and Intellivoices were later offered free with the purchase of a Master Component.<ref name=lives_hw/>  In August 1983 the Intellivoice system was quietly phased out.  A children's title called ''Magic Carousel'', and foreign language versions of ''Space Spartans'' were completed but shelved.   Additional games ''Woody Woodpecker'' and ''Space Shuttle'' went unfinished with the voice recordings unused.\n\nThe four titles available for the Intellivoice system, in order of their release, were:\n\n*''[[Space Spartans]]''\n*''[[B-17 Bomber (video game)|B-17 Bomber]]''\n*''[[Bomb Squad (game)|Bomb Squad]]''\n*''[[Tron: Solar Sailer]]''\n\nA fifth title, ''[[Intellivision World Series Baseball|Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball]]'', developed as part of the Entertainment Computer System series, also supports the Intellivoice if both the ECS and Intellivoice are connected concurrently. Unlike the Intellivoice-specific games, however, ''World Series Major League Baseball'' is also playable without the Intellivoice module (but not without the ECS).\n\n===Intellivision II===\n[[File:Intellivision-II-Console-Set.jpg|link=File:Intellivision-II-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=rectangular gaming console with numerical gamepads connected with short, black spirals|The Intellivision II redesign was much smaller and cheaper to manufacture than the original.]]\n\nIn the spring of 1983, Mattel introduced the ''Intellivision II''. It was not the technology upgrade that was expected, but a cheaper, compact replacement to the original. The Intellivision II was designed to be inexpensive to manufacture and service, with updated styling. It also had longer controller cords.<ref name=EGM91>{{cite magazine |title=Intellivision|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=100}}</ref> The Intellivision II was initially released without a pack-in game but was later packaged with BurgerTime in the United States and Lock'N'Chase in Canada.  In 1984 the Digiplay Intellivision II was introduced in Brazil.<ref name=brasil_historia/>  Brazil was the only country outside North America to have the redesigned Intellivision II.\n\nUsing an external AC Adapter (16.2VAC), consolidating some [[Integrated circuit|ICs]], and taking advantage of relaxed [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] [[Electromagnetic radiation|emission]] standards, the Intellivision II has a significantly smaller footprint than the original. The controllers, now detachable, have a different feel, with plastic rather than rubber side buttons and a flat membrane keypad.  Users of the original Intellivision missed the ability to find keypad buttons by the tactile feel of the original controller bubble keypad.\n\nOne functional difference was the addition of a video input to the cartridge port, added specifically to support the System Changer.  The System Changer, also released in 1983 by Mattel, is an Intellivision peripheral that plays [[Atari 2600]] cartridges through the Intellivision.  The Intellivision hand controllers can be used to play Atari 2600 games.  The System Changer also has two controller ports compatible with Atari joysticks.  The original Intellivision requires a hardware modification in order to work with the ''System Changer''; a service provided by Mattel.  Otherwise the Intellivision II was promoted to be compatible with the original.\n\nIt was discovered that a few Coleco Intellivision games did not work on the Intellivision II.  Mattel secretly changed the Intellivision's internal [[Read-only memory|ROM]] program (Exec) in an attempt to lock out 3rd party titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/intelli2_tech.html|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Intellivision II Console|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref>  A few of [[Coleco]]'s early games were affected but the 3rd party developers quickly figured out how to get around it.  Mattel's own ''Electric Company Word Fun'', however, will not run on the Intellivision II due to this change.  In an unrelated issue but also due to Exec changes, Super Pro Football experiences a minor glitch where the quarterback does not appear until after the ball is hiked. There were also some minor changes to the sound chip ([[AY-3-8910|AY-3-8914A/AY-3-8916]]) affecting sound effects in some games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.intellivision.us/index.php?title=PSG|title=PSG \u2013 Intellivision Wiki|website=wiki.intellivision.us}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://atariage.com/forums/topic/228141-lto-flash-intellivision-flash-cartridge-information/page-53#entry3596200|title=LTO Flash! \u2013 Intellivision Flash Cartridge Information \u2013 Page 53 \u2013 Intellivision / Aquarius|publisher=}}</ref>  Programmers at Mattel discovered the audio differences and avoided the problem in future games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intellivisionaries.com/episode-28-space-spartans/|title=Episode 28: Space Spartans|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n===Intellivision IV===\nDave Chandler's group began designing Mattel's next generation console in 1981 codenamed ''Decade'', now referred to as the ''Intellivision IV''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/intelli4_tech.html|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Intellivision IV Console|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>  It was based on the 32-bit [[Motorola 68000|MC68000]] processor and a 16-bit custom designed advanced graphic interface chip.

The ''Intellivision III'' was to be an upgraded but backward compatible system; based on a similar [[General Instrument CP1600|CP1610]] processor and with an improved graphics STIC chip producing double the resolution with more sprites and colors.  The Intellivision III existed in the lab and a new EXEC was written for it but little else.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/intelli3_tech.html|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Intellivision III Console|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>  It was cancelled in mid-1983.<ref name=\"mitchell19830906\">{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gn0hAAAAIBAJ&sjid=tYoFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5584%2C3561802 | title=A summer-CES report | work=Boston Phoenix | date=September 6, 1983 | accessdate=January 10, 2015 | author=Mitchell, Peter W. | page=4}}</ref>  A [[Mattel]] document called ''Target Specification Intellivision III'' has the following.<ref>{{cite web|title=Target Specification Intellivision III|url=http://papaintellivision.com/docIntv3.php|website=Papa Intellivision}}</ref>\n\n*CPU:  CP1610-2 at 3.56 MHz (2x original CPU speed)\n** separate 16-bit data bus and address bus\n** multiplexed data/address mode for backward compatibility with existing cartridges\n*Graphics:  STIC 1B\n** tiled graphics, 20 cards by 24 rows\n*** 2-color 16x8 pixel cards for a resolution of 320x192\n*** 4-color 8x8 pixel cards for a resolution of 160x192\n** 40 x 24 alphanumerics\n** 16 programmable colors\n*** color palette selectable per card\n*** 12-bit [[RGB]] definition for 4096 possible colors \n** 8 sprites per scanline \n*** reusable on different scanlines\n*** 16 pixels wide in 1 color, 8 pixels wide in 3 colors\n*** up-to 255 lines high\n*** overlap detect of individual colors\n** fine pixel horizontal and vertical scrolling (backward compatible)\n** single data bus allows graphics rom/ram storage on cartridges\n** STIC 1 backwards compatible mode\n* RAM:  4K words, 16-bit, [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] (upgradable to 65K words)\n* five channel sound with improved frequency range (backward compatible)\n* integrated Intellivoice\n\n===Competition and market crash===\n{{See also|North American video game crash of 1983}}\n\nAccording to the company's 1982 [[Form 10-K]], Mattel had almost 20% of the domestic video-game market. Mattel Electronics provided 25% of revenue and 50% of [[operating income]] in fiscal 1982.<ref name=csmonitor/> Although the Atari 2600 had more third-party development, ''[[Creative Computing]] Video & Arcade Games'' reported after visiting the summer 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] that \"The momentum is tremendous\". [[Activision]] and [[Imagic]] began releasing games for the Intellivision, as did hardware rival [[Coleco]]. Mattel created \"[[M Network]]\" branded games for Atari's system.<ref name=\"goodman1983spring\">{{Cite magazine |last=Goodman |first=Danny |author-link=Danny Goodman |date=Spring 1983 |title=Home Video Games: Video Games Update |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/vgupdate.php |magazine=Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games |page=32}}</ref> The company's advertisement budget increased to over $20 million for the year.  In its October 1982 stockholders' report [[Mattel]] announced that ''Electronics'' had, so far that year, posted a nearly $100 million profit on nearly $500 million sales; a threefold increase over October 1981.<ref name=Lives>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/retrotopia/lives.shtml \"Intellivision Lives!

Still hiring continued, and optimism that the investment in software and hardware development will payoff.  The ''M Network'' brand expanded to personal computers.  An office in Taiwan was opened to handle [[Apple II series|Apple II]] programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/credits/computers.shtml#comments|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / M Network Computer Games|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>  The original five-person Mattel game development team had grown to 110 people under new vice president Baum, while Daglow led Intellivision development and top engineer Minkoff directed all work on all other platforms.  In February 1983, Mattel Electronics opened an office in the south of France to provide European input to Intellivision games and develop games for the [[ColecoVision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/people/companies.html|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Companies|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref><ref name=\"gamotek.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamotek.fr/collectionneurs/patrick-aubry/|title=Patrick Aubry, Nice Ideas \u2013 GAMOTEK|publisher=}}</ref>  At its peak Mattel Electronics employed 1800 people.<ref name = nyt84/>\n\nAmid the flurry of new hardware and software development, there was trouble for the Intellivision. New game systems (ColecoVision and [[Atari 5200]]) introduced in 1982 took advantage of falling [[RAM]] prices to offer graphics closer to arcade quality.  In 1983 the price of home computers, particularly the [[Commodore 64]], came down drastically to compete with video game system sales.  The market became flooded with hardware and software, and retailers were ill-equipped to cope.  In spring 1983 hiring at Mattel Electronics came to a halt.\n\nAt the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Mattel Electronics had the opportunity to show off all their new products.  The response was underwhelming.  Amidst massive losses, top management was replaced.  On July 12, 1983, Mattel Electronics President Josh Denham was replaced with outsider Mack Morris.  Morris brought in former Mattel Electronics president and marketing director Jeff Rochlis as a consultant and all projects were under review.  The Intellivision III was cancelled and then all new hardware development was stopped when 660 jobs were cut on August 4.<ref name = nyt84/>  The price of the Intellivision II (which launched at $150 earlier that year) was lowered to $69, Mattel Electronics was to be a software company.<ref name=timeline/>  However, by October 1983 ''Electronics''' losses were over $280 million for the year and one third of the programming staff were laid off.<ref name=Lives/><ref name = nyt84 />  In November another third were gone, and on January 20, 1984 the remaining programming staff were laid-off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_daniel_bass.html|title=DP Interviews...|website=www.digitpress.com}}</ref>  The Taiwan and French offices continued a little while longer due to contract and legal obligations.  On February 4, 1984 Mattel sold the Intellivision business for $20 million.  In 1983, 750,000 Intellivision Master Components were sold, more than three million units from 1980 to 1983.<ref name = nyt84>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/04/business/mattel-is-counting-on-its-toys.html|title=MATTEL IS COUNTING ON ITS TOYS|first=Thomas C.|last=Hayes|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|INTV Corporation (1984-1990)|INTV}}INTV Corporation (1984\u20131990)===\n[[File:INTV-System-III-Console.jpg|link=File:INTV-System-III-Console.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=black and silver gaming console, with 2 gamepads that have a numbers and circular dials|INTV Corp produced their own Intellivision, the INTV System III, after buying the rights from Mattel following the market crash.]]\n\nFormer Mattel Electronics Senior Vice President of Marketing, Terrence Valeski, understood that although losses were huge, the demand for video games increased in 1983.<ref name = INTV>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/credits/intv.shtml#comments INTV Corp Releases] intellivisionlives.com</ref>  Valeski found investors and purchased the rights to Intellivision, the games, and inventory from Mattel.<ref name = nyt84 />  A new company, Intellivision Inc, was formed and by the end of 1984 Valeski bought out the other investors and changed the name to INTV Corporation.  They continued to supply the large toy stores and sold games through direct mail order.  At first they sold the existing inventory of games and Intellivision II systems.  When the inventory of games sold out they produced more, but without the Mattel name or unnecessary licenses on the printed materials.  To lower costs, the boxes, instructions, and overlays were produced at lower quality compared to Mattel.\n\nIn France, the Mattel Electronics office found investors and became '''Nice Ideas''' in  April 1984.  They continued to work on Intellivision, Colecovision, and other computer games.  They produced Intellivision ''World Cup Soccer'' and ''Championship Tennis'', both released in 1985 by European publisher Dextel.<ref name=\"gamotek.fr\"/>\n\nIn 1985 INTV Corporation introduced the ''INTV System III'', also branded as the ''Intellivision Super Pro System'', using the same design as the original Intellivision model but in black and silver. That same year INTV Corp introduced two new games that were completed at Mattel but not released: ''Thunder Castle'' and ''World Championship Baseball''. With their early success INTV Corp decided to produce new games and in 1986 introduced ''Super Pro Football'', an update of Mattel ''NFL Football''. INTV Corp continued a relationship that Mattel had with [[Data East]] and produced all new titles such as [[Commando (video game)|''Commando'']] in 1987 and ''Body Slam Wrestling'' in 1988. Also in 1987 INTV Corp released ''[[Dig Dug]]'', purchased from [[Atari]] where the game was completed but not released in 1984. They also got into producing next generation games with the production of [[Monster Truck Rally (video game)|''Monster Truck Rally'']] for [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1991, also released as ''Stadium Mud Buggies'' for Intellivision in 1989.<ref name = INTV/>\n\nLicensing agreements with Nintendo and Sega required INTV Corporation to discontinue the Intellivision in 1990.

The unit never had overheating problems, nor were loose wires or other connections encountered.\" However, Uston rated the controls and control system as \"below average\" and the worst of the consoles he tested (including [[Atari 2600]], [[Magnavox Odyssey\u00b2]], [[Astrovision]], and [[Fairchild Channel F]]).<ref>Uston, Ken.

It provides two benefits:  reusable code that can effectively make a 4K cartridge an 8K game, and a [[software framework]] for new programmers to develop games more easily and quickly.  It also allows other programmers to more easily review and continue another's project.  Under the supervision of David Rolfe (APh) and graphics supplied by [[Mattel]] artist Dave James, APh was able to quickly create the Intellivision launch title library using mostly summer students.<ref name=lives_companies>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/people/companies.html Where Are They Now?] intellivisionlives.com</ref>  The drawback is that to be flexible and handle many different types of games the Exec runs less efficiently than a dedicated program.  Intellivision games that leverage the Exec run at a 20&nbsp;Hz [[frame rate]] instead of the 60&nbsp;Hz frame rate for which the Intellivision was designed.  Using the Exec framework is optional, but almost all Intellivision games released by Mattel Electronics are 20&nbsp;Hz.  The limited [[ROM cartridge|ROM]] space also meant there was no room for computer artificial intelligence and many early games required two players.\n\nInitially, all Intellivision games were programmed by an outside firm, APh Technological Consulting,<ref name=\"Gamasutra\"/> with 19 cartridges produced before Christmas 1980. Once the Intellivision project became successful, software development was brought in-house.  Mattel formed its own software development group and began hiring programmers.  The original five members of that Intellivision team were Mike Minkoff, Rick Levine, John Sohl, [[Don Daglow]], and manager Gabriel Baum. Levine and Minkoff, a long-time Mattel Toys veteran, both came over from the hand-held Mattel games engineering team. During 1981 Mattel hired programmers as fast it could.  Early in 1982 Mattel Electronics relocated from Mattel headquarters to an unused industrial building.  Office renovation work happened as new staff moved in. To keep these programmers from being hired away by rival [[Atari, Inc.|Atari]], their identity and work location was kept a closely guarded secret. In public, the programmers were referred to collectively as the [[Blue Sky Rangers]].\n\nMost of the early games were based on traditional real-world concepts such as sports, with an emphasis on realism and depth of play within the technology of the day.  The Intellivision was not marketed as a toy; as such, games such as ''Sea Battle'' and ''B-17 Bomber'' are not made in a pick-up-and-play format which [[arcade game|arcade style]] games are.  Reading the instructions is often a prerequisite to play.  Every cartridge produced by Mattel Electronics included two plastic controller \"overlays\" to help navigate the 12 keypad buttons, although not every game made use of the keypad.  Mattel organized its games into networks: ''Major League Sports, Action, Strategy, Gaming, Children's Learning'' and later ''Space Action'' and ''Arcade''.  The network concept was dropped in 1983, as were the convenient gate-fold style boxes for storing the cartridge, instructions, and overlays.\n\nStarting in 1981 programmers looking for credit and royalties on sales began leaving both APh and Mattel Electronics to create Intellivision cartridges for third-party publishers.  They helped form [[Imagic]] in 1981 and in 1982 others joined [[Activision]] and Atari.  Cheshire Engineering was formed by a few senior APh programmers including David Rolfe (author of the Exec) and Tom Loughry, who had created one of the most popular Intellivision games ''[[Advanced Dungeons & Dragons: Cloudy Mountain|Advanced Dungeons and Dragons]]'';<ref name=\"loughry\">{{cite web |last1=Goninon |first1=Mark |title=Where are they now? \u2013 Tom Loughry |url=https://www.choicestgames.com/2014/11/where-are-they-now-tom-loughry.html |website=Choicest Games |publisher=Choicest Games |accessdate=26 Nov 2014}}</ref> Cheshire created Intellivision games for Activision.  Third-party developers Activision, Imagic, and Coleco started producing Intellivision cartridges in 1982, and Atari, Parker Brothers, Sega, and Interphase followed in 1983.  The third-party developers, not having legal access to Exec knowledge, often bypassed the Exec framework to create smooth 30&nbsp;Hz and 60&nbsp;Hz Intellivision games such as ''The Dreadnaught Factor''.  Cheaper [[Read-only memory|ROM]] prices also allowed for larger games as 8K, 12K, and then 16K cartridges became common.  The first Mattel Electronics Intellivision game to run at 60&nbsp;Hz was ''Masters of the Universe'' in 1983.<ref>https://www.linkedin.com/in/rick-koenig-71a50412/</ref>  Marketing dubbed the term \"Super Graphics\" on the game's packaging and marketing.\n\nMattel Electronics' team of programmers was diverse in experience and talent, which proved to be an advantage.  As competitors often depended on licensing well known [[trademark]]s to sell video games, Mattel focused on original ideas. Don Daglow was a key early programmer at Mattel and became director of Intellivision game development.  Daglow created [[Utopia (video game)|''Utopia'']], a precursor to the [[Construction and management simulation|sim genre]] and, with Eddie Dombrower, the ground breaking sports simulation [[Intellivision World Series Baseball|''World Series Major League Baseball'']]. Daglow was also involved with the popular Intellivision games ''Tron Deadly Discs'' and ''Shark! Shark!''.<ref name=\"gama_dd_art\">{{cite web |last1=Wallis |first1=Alistair |title=Playing Catch Up: Stormfront Studios' Don Daglow |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/102180/Column_Playing_Catch_Up_Stormfront_Studios_Don_Daglow.php |website=Gamasutra |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=19 Oct 2006}}</ref><ref name=\"gama_dd_int\">{{cite web |last1=Sheffield |first1=Brandon |last2=Frank |first2=Frank |title=From Intellivision To Today: Talking To Don Daglow |url=https://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/112971/From_Intellivision_To_Today_Talking_To_Don_Daglow.php |website=Gamasutra |publisher=Gamasutra |accessdate=30 Jan 2009}}</ref> After Mattel Electronics closed in 1984, their programmers would go on to make significant contributions to the video game industry.

Bill Fisher, Steve Roney and Mike Breen founded [[Quicksilver Software]] and David Warhol founded [[Realtime Associates]].<ref name=lives_companies/>\n\n===Keyboard Component===\n[[File:Intellivision - trojandan 14871699 - white background.jpg|thumb|Intellivision \u2013 trojandan 14871699 \u2013 white background|The ''Keyboard Component'' code-named the ''Blue Whale'' also known as the ''Intelliputer''<ref name=KC/>]]\nFrom the beginning, Intellivision's packaging and promotional materials, as well as television commercials, promised the addition of a soon-to-be-available accessory called the \"Keyboard Component\".  The Intellivision was designed as a modular home computer.  The ''Master Component'' could be purchased as a stand-alone video game system and the ''Keyboard Component'' could be added, providing the computer keyboard and tape drive.  Not meant to be a hobbyist or business computer, the Intellivision home computer was meant to run pre-programmed software and bring \"data flow\" ([[Videotex]]) into the home.<ref name=papaint_his/>\n\nThe Keyboard Component added an 8-bit [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] processor making the Intellivision a dual processor computer.  It had 16K 10-bit shared RAM that could load and execute both Intellivision [[General Instrument CP1600|CP1610]] and 6502 program code from tape; a large amount as typical cartridges of the day were 4K.  The cassettes have two tracks of digital data and two tracks of analog audio completely controlled by the computer.  Two tracks are read only for the software, and two tracks for user data.  The tape-drive was block addressed with high speed indexing.  A high resolution 40x24 monochrome text display could overlay regular Intellivision graphics.  There was an input for a microphone and two additional expansion ports for peripherals and [[random-access memory|RAM]] expansion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wiki.intellivision.us/index.php?title=Keyboard_Component|title=Keyboard Component \u2013 Intellivision Wiki|website=wiki.intellivision.us}}</ref>  The [[Microsoft BASIC]] programming cartridge used one of these ports.  Expanded memory cartridges could support 1000 8KB pages.  A third pass-through cartridge port was for regular Intellivision cartridges.  It uses the Intellivision's power supply.  A 40-column thermal printer was available, and a telephone [[modem]] was planned along with voice synthesis and voice recognition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intellivisionbrasil.com.br/docs/catalogos/1980-81_Mattel-EUA_00073240-B.pdf |title=IntelliVision |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2019-07-23}}</ref>\n\nDavid Rolfe of APh wrote a control program for the Keyboard Component called ''PicSe'' (Picture Sequencer) specifically for the development of multimedia applications. PicSe synchronized the graphics and analog audio while concurrently saving or loading data to tape.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gooddealgames.com/interviews/int_rolfe.html|title=Good Deal Games \u2013 Classic Videogame Games INTERVIEW \u2013 David Rolfe|website=www.gooddealgames.com}}</ref>  Productivity software for home finances, personal improvement, and [[educational software|self education]] were planned.  Subject experts were consulted and their voices recorded and used in the software.\n\nThree applications using the PicSe system were released on cassette tape: \n*''Conversational French''\n*''Jack Lalanne's Physical Conditioning'' \n*''Spelling Challenge''\n\nFive [[Microsoft BASIC|BASIC]] applications were released on tape:  ''Programs written in BASIC did not have access to Intellivision graphics and were sold at a lower price.''\n*''Family Budgeting''\n*''Geography Challenge''\n*''Crosswords I, II, and III''\n\nWhile the Keyboard Component was an ambitious piece of engineering for its time it was repeatedly delayed as the engineers tried to reduce manufacturing costs.  In August 1979 the Intellivision Keyboard Component, in [[breadboard]] form, was successfully entered into the [[Sears]] Market Research Program.  In December 1979 Mattel had production design working units but decided on a significant internal design change to consolidate circuit boards.  In September 1980 it was test marketed in Fresno, California but without software, except for the BASIC programming cartridge.  In the fall of 1981 design changes were finally implemented and the ''Keyboard Component'' was released at $600<ref name=timeline/> in Seattle and New Orleans only.<ref name=papaint_his/>  Those that complained in writing could buy a Keyboard Component directly from Mattel.  The printer, a rebadged Alphacom Sprinter 40,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://papaintellivision.com/hwKeyboard.php|title=Keyboard Component Hardware \u2013 Papa Intellivision|website=papaintellivision.com}}</ref> was only available by mail order.\n\nThe keyboard component's repeated delays became so notorious around Mattel headquarters that comedian [[Jay Leno]], when performing at Mattel's 1981 Christmas party, got his biggest titter of the evening with the line: \"You know what the three big lies are, don't you? 'The check is in the mail,' 'I'll still respect you in the morning,' and 'The keyboard will be out in spring.'\"<ref name=KC>{{cite web | url = https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/keyboard_tech.html | publisher = Intellivision Lives | title = Keyboard Component}}</ref>\n\nComplaints from consumers who had chosen to buy the Intellivision specifically on the promise of a \"coming soon\" personal-computer upgrade, eventually caught the attention of the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), who started investigating Mattel Electronics for fraud and false advertising. In mid-1982 the FTC ordered Mattel to pay a monthly fine (said to be $10,000) until the promised computer upgrade was in full retail distribution.<ref name=KC /> To protect themselves from the ongoing fines, the Keyboard Component was officially canceled in August 1982 and the Entertainment Computer System (ECS) module offered up in its place.  Part of Mattel's settlement with the FTC involved offering to buy back all of the existing Keyboard Components from customers. Mattel provided a full refund but without a receipt paid $550 for the Keyboard Component, $60 for the BASIC cartridge, and $30 for each cassette software.<ref name=dereinte>{{cite web|url=http://spatula-city.org/~im14u2c/intv/jzintv-1.0-beta3/doc/De_Re_Intellivision/dri_1.txt|title=De Re Intellivision|publisher=}}</ref>  Any customer who opted to keep theirs was required to sign a waiver with the understanding that no more software would be written for the system and absolved Mattel of any future responsibility for technical support.<ref name=lives_hw>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/index.html] intellivisionlives.com</ref> They were also compensated with $1000 worth of Mattel Electronics products.<ref name=dereinte />\n\nWhile approximately 4,000 Keyboard Components were manufactured, it is not clear how many of them actually found their way into the hands of Intellivision customers. Today, very few of them still exist.  Many of the units were dismantled for parts.  Others were used by Mattel Electronics programmers as part of their development system.  A Keyboard Component could be interfaced with an Intellivision development system in place of the hand-built Magus board [[RAM]] cartridge.  Data transfer to the Keyboard Component RAM had to be done serially and was slower compared with the Magus board parallel interface.<ref name=KC/>\n\nThe keyboard component debacle was ranked as No. 11 on ''[[GameSpy]]''{{'}}s \"25 dumbest moments in gaming\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/index14.shtml | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081231052715/http://archive.gamespy.com/articles/june03/dumbestmoments/index14.shtml | archivedate = December 31, 2008 | publisher = GameSpy | title = Dumbest Moments}}</ref>\n\n===Entertainment Computer System (ECS)===\n{{Main article|Entertainment Computer System}}\nIn mid-1981, Mattel's upper management was becoming concerned that the keyboard component division would never be able to produce a sellable product. As a result, Mattel Electronics set up a competing internal engineering team whose stated mission was to produce an inexpensive add-on called the \"Basic Development System\", or BDS, to be sold as an educational device to introduce kids to the concepts of computer programming.\n\nThe rival BDS engineering group, who had to keep the project's real purpose a secret among themselves, fearing that if David Chandler, the head of the keyboard component team, found out about it he would use his influence to end the project, eventually came up with a much less expensive alternative. Originally dubbed the \"Lucky\", from LUCKI: Low User-Cost Keyboard Interface, it lacked many of the sophisticated features envisioned for the original keyboard component. Gone, for example, was the 16K (8MB max) of RAM, the secondary CPU, and high resolution text; instead, the ECS offered a mere 2KB RAM expansion, a built-in BASIC that was marginally functional, plus a much-simplified cassette and printer interface.\n\nUltimately, this fulfilled the original promises of turning the Intellivision into a computer, making it possible to write programs and store them to tape, and interfacing with a printer well enough to allow Mattel to claim that they had delivered the promised computer upgrade and stop the FTC's mounting fines. It even offered, via an additional sound chip ([[General Instrument AY-3-8910|AY-3-8917]]) inside the ECS module and an optional 49-key music synthesizer keyboard, the possibility of turning the Intellivision into a multi-voice synthesizer which could be used to play or learn music.\n\nIn the fall of 1982, the LUCKI, now renamed the Entertainment Computer System (ECS), was presented at the annual sales meeting, officially ending the ill-fated keyboard component project. A new advertising campaign was aired in time for the 1982 Christmas season, and the ECS itself was shown to the public at the January 1983 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES) in Las Vegas. A few months later, the ECS hit the market, and the FTC agreed to drop the $10K per day fines.\n\nBy the time the ECS made its retail debut as the Intellivision Computer Module, an internal shake-up at the top levels of Mattel Electronics' management had caused the company's focus to shift away from hardware add-ons in favor of software, and the ECS received very little in terms of furthering the marketing push. Further hardware developments, including a planned Program Expander that would have added another 16K of RAM and a more intricate, fully featured Extended-BASIC to the system, were halted.  In the end a half-dozen software titles were released for the ECS; a few more were completed but not released.\n\nThe ECS also offered four player game-play with the optional addition of two extra hand controllers.  Four player games were in development when Mattel Electronics closed in 1984.  ''World Cup Soccer'' was later completed and released in 1985 by Dextel in Europe and then INTV Corporation in North America.  The documentation does not mention it but when the ECS Computer Adapter is used, ''World Cup Soccer'' can be played with one to four players, or two players cooperatively against the computer.\n\n===Intellivoice===\n{{Main article|Intellivoice}}\n[[File:Intellivoice.jpg|link=File:Intellivoice.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Brown rectangular box with a volume knob|The [[Intellivoice]] add-on]]\nIn 1982 Mattel introduced a new peripheral for the Intellivision:  the ''Intellivoice Voice Synthesis Module''.  A [[speech synthesis|speech synthesizer]] which produces speech with compatible cartridges. The Intellivoice was original in two respects: human sounding male and female voices with distinct accents, and the speech-supporting games were designed with speech being an integral part of the game-play.\n\nLike the Intellivision chip-set, the Intellivoice chip-set was developed by [[General Instrument]].  The [[General Instrument SP0256|SP0256-012]] orator [[Integrated circuit|chip]] has 2KB [[Read-only memory|ROM]] inside, and is used to store the speech for numerical digits, some common words, and the phrase \"Mattel Electronics presents\".  Speech can also be processed from the Intellivoice's SP650 buffer chip,  stored and loaded from cartridge memory.  That buffer chip has its own [[Input/output|I/O]] and the Intellivoice has a 30-pin expansion port under a removable top plate.  Mattel Electronics planned to use that connector for wireless hand controllers.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/voice_tech.html#systag|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Intellivoice Module|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>\n\nMattel Electronics built a state of the art voice processing lab to produce the phrases used in Intellivoice games.  However, the amount of speech that could be compressed into an 8K or 12K cartridge and still leave room for a game was limited.  Intellivoice cartridges ''Space Spartans'' and ''B-17 Bomber'' did sell about 300,000 copies each, priced a few dollars more than regular Intellivision cartridges.  However, at $79 the Intellivoice did not sell as well as Mattel expected, and Intellivoices were later offered free with the purchase of a Master Component.<ref name=lives_hw/>  In August 1983 the Intellivoice system was quietly phased out.  A children's title called ''Magic Carousel'', and foreign language versions of ''Space Spartans'' were completed but shelved.   Additional games ''Woody Woodpecker'' and ''Space Shuttle'' went unfinished with the voice recordings unused.\n\nThe four titles available for the Intellivoice system, in order of their release, were:\n\n*''[[Space Spartans]]''\n*''[[B-17 Bomber (video game)|B-17 Bomber]]''\n*''[[Bomb Squad (game)|Bomb Squad]]''\n*''[[Tron: Solar Sailer]]''\n\nA fifth title, ''[[Intellivision World Series Baseball|Intellivision World Series Major League Baseball]]'', developed as part of the Entertainment Computer System series, also supports the Intellivoice if both the ECS and Intellivoice are connected concurrently. Unlike the Intellivoice-specific games, however, ''World Series Major League Baseball'' is also playable without the Intellivoice module (but not without the ECS).\n\n===Intellivision II===\n[[File:Intellivision-II-Console-Set.jpg|link=File:Intellivision-II-Console-Set.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=rectangular gaming console with numerical gamepads connected with short, black spirals|The Intellivision II redesign was much smaller and cheaper to manufacture than the original.]]\n\nIn the spring of 1983, Mattel introduced the ''Intellivision II''. It was not the technology upgrade that was expected, but a cheaper, compact replacement to the original. The Intellivision II was designed to be inexpensive to manufacture and service, with updated styling. It also had longer controller cords.<ref name=EGM91>{{cite magazine |title=Intellivision|magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=91|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=February 1997|page=100}}</ref> The Intellivision II was initially released without a pack-in game but was later packaged with BurgerTime in the United States and Lock'N'Chase in Canada.  In 1984 the Digiplay Intellivision II was introduced in Brazil.<ref name=brasil_historia/>  Brazil was the only country outside North America to have the redesigned Intellivision II.\n\nUsing an external AC Adapter (16.2VAC), consolidating some [[Integrated circuit|ICs]], and taking advantage of relaxed [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] [[Electromagnetic radiation|emission]] standards, the Intellivision II has a significantly smaller footprint than the original. The controllers, now detachable, have a different feel, with plastic rather than rubber side buttons and a flat membrane keypad.  Users of the original Intellivision missed the ability to find keypad buttons by the tactile feel of the original controller bubble keypad.\n\nOne functional difference was the addition of a video input to the cartridge port, added specifically to support the System Changer.  The System Changer, also released in 1983 by Mattel, is an Intellivision peripheral that plays [[Atari 2600]] cartridges through the Intellivision.  The Intellivision hand controllers can be used to play Atari 2600 games.  The System Changer also has two controller ports compatible with Atari joysticks.  The original Intellivision requires a hardware modification in order to work with the ''System Changer''; a service provided by Mattel.  Otherwise the Intellivision II was promoted to be compatible with the original.\n\nIt was discovered that a few Coleco Intellivision games did not work on the Intellivision II.  Mattel secretly changed the Intellivision's internal [[Read-only memory|ROM]] program (Exec) in an attempt to lock out 3rd party titles.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/hardware/intelli2_tech.html|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Intellivision II Console|publisher=|accessdate=January 1, 2017}}</ref>  A few of [[Coleco]]'s early games were affected but the 3rd party developers quickly figured out how to get around it.  Mattel's own ''Electric Company Word Fun'', however, will not run on the Intellivision II due to this change.  In an unrelated issue but also due to Exec changes, Super Pro Football experiences a minor glitch where the quarterback does not appear until after the ball is hiked.

Mattel Electronics provided 25% of revenue and 50% of [[operating income]] in fiscal 1982.<ref name=csmonitor/> Although the Atari 2600 had more third-party development, ''[[Creative Computing]] Video & Arcade Games'' reported after visiting the summer 1982 [[Consumer Electronics Show]] that \"The momentum is tremendous\". [[Activision]] and [[Imagic]] began releasing games for the Intellivision, as did hardware rival [[Coleco]]. Mattel created \"[[M Network]]\" branded games for Atari's system.<ref name=\"goodman1983spring\">{{Cite magazine |last=Goodman |first=Danny |author-link=Danny Goodman |date=Spring 1983 |title=Home Video Games: Video Games Update |url=http://www.atarimagazines.com/cva/v1n1/vgupdate.php |magazine=Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games |page=32}}</ref> The company's advertisement budget increased to over $20 million for the year.  In its October 1982 stockholders' report [[Mattel]] announced that ''Electronics'' had, so far that year, posted a nearly $100 million profit on nearly $500 million sales; a threefold increase over October 1981.<ref name=Lives>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/retrotopia/lives.shtml \"Intellivision Lives!

Still hiring continued, and optimism that the investment in software and hardware development will payoff.  The ''M Network'' brand expanded to personal computers.  An office in Taiwan was opened to handle [[Apple II series|Apple II]] programming.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/credits/computers.shtml#comments|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / M Network Computer Games|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>  The original five-person Mattel game development team had grown to 110 people under new vice president Baum, while Daglow led Intellivision development and top engineer Minkoff directed all work on all other platforms.  In February 1983, Mattel Electronics opened an office in the south of France to provide European input to Intellivision games and develop games for the [[ColecoVision]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/people/companies.html|title=Intellivision Classic Video Game System / Companies|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref><ref name=\"gamotek.fr\">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamotek.fr/collectionneurs/patrick-aubry/|title=Patrick Aubry, Nice Ideas \u2013 GAMOTEK|publisher=}}</ref>  At its peak Mattel Electronics employed 1800 people.<ref name = nyt84/>\n\nAmid the flurry of new hardware and software development, there was trouble for the Intellivision. New game systems (ColecoVision and [[Atari 5200]]) introduced in 1982 took advantage of falling [[RAM]] prices to offer graphics closer to arcade quality.  In 1983 the price of home computers, particularly the [[Commodore 64]], came down drastically to compete with video game system sales.  The market became flooded with hardware and software, and retailers were ill-equipped to cope.  In spring 1983 hiring at Mattel Electronics came to a halt.\n\nAt the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago, Mattel Electronics had the opportunity to show off all their new products.  The response was underwhelming.  Amidst massive losses, top management was replaced.  On July 12, 1983, Mattel Electronics President Josh Denham was replaced with outsider Mack Morris.  Morris brought in former Mattel Electronics president and marketing director Jeff Rochlis as a consultant and all projects were under review.  The Intellivision III was cancelled and then all new hardware development was stopped when 660 jobs were cut on August 4.<ref name = nyt84/>  The price of the Intellivision II (which launched at $150 earlier that year) was lowered to $69, Mattel Electronics was to be a software company.<ref name=timeline/>  However, by October 1983 ''Electronics''' losses were over $280 million for the year and one third of the programming staff were laid off.<ref name=Lives/><ref name = nyt84 />  In November another third were gone, and on January 20, 1984 the remaining programming staff were laid-off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitpress.com/library/interviews/interview_daniel_bass.html|title=DP Interviews...|website=www.digitpress.com}}</ref>  The Taiwan and French offices continued a little while longer due to contract and legal obligations.  On February 4, 1984 Mattel sold the Intellivision business for $20 million.  In 1983, 750,000 Intellivision Master Components were sold, more than three million units from 1980 to 1983.<ref name = nyt84>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/04/business/mattel-is-counting-on-its-toys.html|title=MATTEL IS COUNTING ON ITS TOYS|first=Thomas C.|last=Hayes|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==={{anchor|INTV Corporation (1984-1990)|INTV}}INTV Corporation (1984\u20131990)===\n[[File:INTV-System-III-Console.jpg|link=File:INTV-System-III-Console.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=black and silver gaming console, with 2 gamepads that have a numbers and circular dials|INTV Corp produced their own Intellivision, the INTV System III, after buying the rights from Mattel following the market crash.]]\n\nFormer Mattel Electronics Senior Vice President of Marketing, Terrence Valeski, understood that although losses were huge, the demand for video games increased in 1983.<ref name = INTV>[https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/bluesky/games/credits/intv.shtml#comments INTV Corp Releases] intellivisionlives.com</ref>  Valeski found investors and purchased the rights to Intellivision, the games, and inventory from Mattel.<ref name = nyt84 />  A new company, Intellivision Inc, was formed and by the end of 1984 Valeski bought out the other investors and changed the name to INTV Corporation.  They continued to supply the large toy stores and sold games through direct mail order.  At first they sold the existing inventory of games and Intellivision II systems.  When the inventory of games sold out they produced more, but without the Mattel name or unnecessary licenses on the printed materials.  To lower costs, the boxes, instructions, and overlays were produced at lower quality compared to Mattel.\n\nIn France, the Mattel Electronics office found investors and became '''Nice Ideas''' in  April 1984.  They continued to work on Intellivision, Colecovision, and other computer games.  They produced Intellivision ''World Cup Soccer'' and ''Championship Tennis'', both released in 1985 by European publisher Dextel.<ref name=\"gamotek.fr\"/>\n\nIn 1985 INTV Corporation introduced the ''INTV System III'', also branded as the ''Intellivision Super Pro System'', using the same design as the original Intellivision model but in black and silver. That same year INTV Corp introduced two new games that were completed at Mattel but not released: ''Thunder Castle'' and ''World Championship Baseball''. With their early success INTV Corp decided to produce new games and in 1986 introduced ''Super Pro Football'', an update of Mattel ''NFL Football''. INTV Corp continued a relationship that Mattel had with [[Data East]] and produced all new titles such as [[Commando (video game)|''Commando'']] in 1987 and ''Body Slam Wrestling'' in 1988. Also in 1987 INTV Corp released ''[[Dig Dug]]'', purchased from [[Atari]] where the game was completed but not released in 1984. They also got into producing next generation games with the production of [[Monster Truck Rally (video game)|''Monster Truck Rally'']] for [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1991, also released as ''Stadium Mud Buggies'' for Intellivision in 1989.<ref name = INTV/>\n\nLicensing agreements with Nintendo and Sega required INTV Corporation to discontinue the Intellivision in 1990. INTV Corporation did publish 21 new Intellivision cartridges bringing the Intellivision library to a total of 124 cartridges plus one compilation cartridge.\n\n===Tutorvision===\n{{See also|List of Intellivision games#Tutorvision}}\nIn 1989 INTV Corp and [[World Book Encyclopedia]] entered into an agreement to manufacture an educational video game system called Tutorvision.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170614/http://www.intellivisionlives.com/media/newsletters/news030715.html|title=Intellivision Classic Videogame System July 2003 News|website=www.intellivisionlives.com}}</ref>  It is a modified Intellivision, the case molded in light beige with gold and blue trim.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zutco.com/Tutorvision.htm|title=The Virtual Pac-Man Museum|website=www.zutco.com}}</ref>  The Exec [[Read-only memory|ROM]] expanded, system RAM increased to 1.75K, and graphics [[Random-access memory|RAM]] increased to 2KB.<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/13ApQEm1Xw_DcCAaXcQvpFot_BvrzSzeUo95EXCf41uc/pub|title=TutorVision / INTV88 Reverse Engineering Notes|website=docs.google.com}}</ref>  That is enough graphics RAM to define unique graphic tiles for the entire screen.\n\nGames were designed by [[World Book Encyclopedia|World Book]], ''J.

Together they have over 100 Intellivision games including never before released ''King of the Mountain, Takeover, Robot Rubble'', ''League of Light'', and others. Intellivision Rocks includes Intellivision games made by [[Activision]] and [[Imagic]].

He is best known for his epic fantasy ''[[The Neverending Story]]''; other famous works include ''[[Momo (novel)|Momo]]'' and ''[[Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver]]''. His works have been translated into more than 40 languages, sold more than 35 million copies,<ref>http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/autordetail-seite/michael-ende-87/</ref> and adapted as motion pictures, stage plays, operas and audio books. Ende is one of the most popular and famous German authors of the 20th century, mostly due to the enormous success of his children's fiction. He was not strictly a children's writer, however, as he wrote books for adults too.\nEnde's writing could be described as a surreal mixture of reality and fantasy.\n\n==Early life==\nEnde was born 12 November 1929 in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[Bavaria]], the only child of the [[surrealism|surrealist]] painter [[Edgar Ende]] and Luise Bartholom\u00e4 Ende, a physiotherapist (Coby).{{huh|date=September 2016}} In 1935, when Michael was six, the Ende family moved to the \"artists' quarter of [[Schwabing]]\" in Munich (Haase).{{huh|date=September 2016}} Growing up in this rich artistic and literary environment influenced Ende's later writing.\n\nIn 1936, his father's work was declared \"degenerate\" and banned by the Nazi party, so Edgar Ende was forced to work in secret.<ref name=biografie>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/michael-ende/biografie/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702212212/http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/michael-ende/biografie/ |archive-date=2016-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The horrors of [[World War II]] heavily influenced Ende's childhood. He was twelve years old when the first air raid took place above Munich. He reflected:\n<blockquote>Our street was consumed by flames. The fire didn't crackle; it roared. The flames were roaring. I remember singing and careering through the blaze like a drunkard. I was in the grip of a kind of euphoria. I still don't truly understand it, but I was almost tempted to cast myself into the fire like a moth into the light. </blockquote>\nHe was horrified by the [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|1943 Hamburg bombing]], which he experienced while visiting his paternal uncle. At the first available opportunity his uncle put him on a train back to Munich. There, Ende attended the Maximillians Gymnasium in Munich until schools were closed as the air raids intensified and pupils were evacuated. Ende returned to [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], where he was billeted in a boarding-house, Haus Kramerhof and later in Haus Roseneck. It was there that his interest in poetry was awakened. As well as writing his own poetry, he began to study poetical movements and styles. A good deal of modern poetry was banned at the time, so he studied the Romantic poet [[Novalis]], whose ''Hymns to the Night'' left a great impression on him.\n\nIn 1944, Edgar Ende's studio at no. 90 Kaulbachstra\u00dfe, Munich went up in flames. Over two hundred and fifty paintings and sketches were destroyed, as well as all his prints and etchings. {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernst Buchner (historian)|de|3=Ernst Buchner (Kunsthistoriker)|lt=Ernst Buchner}}, Director of Public Art for Bavaria, was still in possession of a number of Ende's paintings, and they survived the raids. After the bombing, Luise Ende was relocated to the Munich district of Solln. In 1945, Edgar Ende was taken prisoner by the Americans and released soon after the war.\n\nIn 1945, German youths as young as fourteen were drafted into the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' and sent to war against the advancing Allied armies. Three of Michael Ende's classmates were killed on their first day of action. Ende was also drafted, but he tore up his call-up papers and joined a Bavarian resistance movement founded to sabotage the SS's declared intention to defend Munich until the \"bitter end\". He served as a courier for the group for the remainder of the war.\n\nIn 1946, Michael Ende's grammar school re-opened, and he attended classes for a year, following which the financial support of family friends allowed him to complete his high-school education at a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf School]] in [[Stuttgart]]. This seemingly charitable gesture was motivated by more self-interest: Ende had fallen in love with a girl three years his senior, and her parents funded his two-year stay in Stuttgart to keep the pair apart. It was at this time that he first began to write stories (\"Michael,\" par. 3).{{huh|date=September 2016}} He aspired to be a \"dramatist,\" but wrote mostly short stories and poems (Haase).{{huh|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nDuring his time in Stuttgart, Ende first encountered [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] and [[Dada]]ist writing and began schooling himself in literature. He studied [[Theodor D\u00e4ubler]], [[Yvan Goll]], [[Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler]] and [[Alfred Mombert]], but his real love was the poetry of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Stefan George]] and [[Georg Trakl]]. He also made his first attempts at acting, performing with friends in Stuttgart's America House. He was involved in productions of [[Chekhov]]'s one-act comedy \"The Bear\", in which he played the principal role, and in the German premiere of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s \"[[Orpheus]]\". Ende's first play \"Denn die Stunde dr\u00e4ngt (As Time is Running Out)\" dates to this period. It was dedicated to [[Hiroshima]], and was never performed.\n\nEnde decided that he wanted to be a playwright, but financial considerations ruled out a university degree, so in 1948 he auditioned for the [[Otto Falckenberg School of the Performing Arts]] in Munich and was granted a two-year scholarship (Haase).\nOn leaving drama school, his first job as an actor took him to a provincial theatre company in Schleswig-Holstein. The troupe travelled from town to town by bus, usually performing on makeshift stages, surrounded by beer, smoke and the clatter of skittles from nearby bowling alleys. The acting was a disappointment, he usually had to play old men and malicious schemers, and had barely enough time to memorize his lines. Despite the frustrations and disappointments of his early acting career, Ende came to value his time in the provinces as a valuable learning experience that endowed him with a practical, down-to-earth approach to his work: \"It was a good experience, a healthy experience. Anyone interested in writing should be made to do that sort of thing. It doesn't have to be restricted to acting. It could be any kind of practical activity like cabinet making\u2014learning how to construct a cabinet in which the doors fit properly.\" In Ende's view, practical training had the potential to be more useful than a literary degree.\n\nThanks to the numerous contacts of his girlfriend [[Ingeborg Hoffmann]], Michael Ende was introduced to a variety of cabaret groups. In 1955, {{Interlanguage link multi|Therese Angeloff|de}}, head of {{Interlanguage link multi|Die kleinen Fische|de}} (the 'Little Fish' cabaret), commissioned Ende to write a piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s death. Ende produced a sketch in which a statue of Schiller was interviewed about newsworthy issues, and replied with quotes from Schiller's work. \"There was rapturous applause, and commissions arrived from other cabarets too.\" Michael Ende began to compose sketches, chansons and monologues. He also worked as a film critic during the 1950s.<ref>https://www.inhaltsangabe.de/autoren/ende/</ref>\n\n===Commercial success: writing ''Jim Knopf''===\nIn the late 1950s, Ende wrote his first novel ''Jim Button''.\n{{Quote|I sat down at my desk and wrote: \"The country in which the engine-driver, Luke, lived was called Morrowland. It was a rather small country.\" Once I'd written the two lines, I hadn't a clue how the third line might go. I didn't start out with a concept or a plan\u2014I just left myself drift from one sentence and one thought to the next. That's how I discovered that writing could be an adventure. The story carried on growing, new characters started appearing, and to my astonishment different plotlines began to weave together. The manuscript was getting longer all the time and was already much more than a picture book. I finally wrote the last sentence ten months later, and a great stack of paper had accumulated on the desk.}}\nMichael Ende always said that ideas only came to him when the logic of the story required them. On some occasions he waited a long time for inspiration to arrive.\nAt one point during the writing of ''Jim Button'' the plot reached a dead end. Jim and Luke were stuck among black rocks and their tank engine couldn't go any further. Ende was at a loss to think of a way out of the adventure, but cutting the episode struck him as disingenuous. Three weeks later he was about to shelve the novel when suddenly he had an idea\u2014the steam from the tank engine could freeze and cover the rocks in snow, thus saving his characters from their scrape. \"In my case, writing is primarily a question of patience,\" he once commented.<ref name=birth>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/a-famous-first-line-that-gave-birth-to-a-novel</ref>\n\nAfter nearly a year the five hundred pages of manuscript were complete.\nOver the next eighteen months he sent the manuscript to ten different publishers, but they all responded that it was \"Unsuitable for our list\" or \"Too long for children\". In the end he began to lose hope and toyed with the idea of throwing away the script. He eventually tried it at a small family publishing-house, K. {{Interlanguage link multi|Thienemann Verlag|de}} in Stuttgart. Michael Ende's manuscript was accepted by company director Lotte Weitbrecht who liked the story. Her only stipulation was that the manuscript had to be published as two separate books.\n\nThe first of the ''Jim Button'' novels was published in 1960. About a year later, on the morning of the announcement that his novel, ''Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver'', had won the German Prize for Children's Fiction, Ende was being sued by his landlady for seven months' rent backpayment. With the prize money of five thousand marks, Michael Ende's financial situation improved substantially and his writing career began in earnest. After the awards ceremony, he embarked on his first reading tour, and within a year, the first ''Jim Knopf'' book was also nominated for the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] and received the Berlin Literary Prize for Youth Fiction.\nThe second ''Jim Knopf'' novel, ''Jim Button and the Wild Thirteen'', was published in 1962. Both books were serialized on radio and TV, and the [[Augsburger Puppenkiste]] famously adapted the novels in a version filmed by Hesse's broadcasting corporation. The print-runs sold out so rapidly that K. Thienemanns could barely keep up. Translations into numerous foreign languages soon followed.<ref name=birth/>\n\n===Writing style and themes===\nEnde claimed, \"It is for this child in me, and in all of us, that I tell my stories\", and that \"[my books are] for any child between 80 and 8 years\" (qtd. Senick 95, 97). He often expressed frustration over being perceived as a children's writer exclusively, considering that his purpose was to speak of cultural problems and spiritual wisdom to people of all ages. Especially in Germany, Ende was accused by some critics of [[escapism]].<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/escapism-censured</ref><ref>https://www.welt.de/kultur/article5174581/Michael-Endes-Buecher-waren-Opium-fuer-Kinder.html</ref> He wrote in 1985:\n\n<blockquote>One may enter the literary parlor via just about any door, be it the prison door, the madhouse door, or the brothel door. There is but one door one may not enter it through, which is the nursery door. The critics will never forgive you such. The great [[Rudyard Kipling]] is one to have suffered this. I keep wondering to myself what this peculiar contempt towards anything related to childhood is all about.<ref>\"''Man darf von jeder T\u00fcr aus in den literarischen Salon treten, aus der Gef\u00e4ngnist\u00fcr, aus der Irrenhaust\u00fcr oder aus der Bordellt\u00fcr. Nur aus einer T\u00fcr darf man nicht kommen, aus der Kinderzimmert\u00fcr. Das vergibt einem die Kritik nicht. Das bekam schon der gro\u00dfe Rudyard Kipling zu sp\u00fcren.

The reader is often invited to take a more interactive role in the story, and the worlds in his books often mirror our reality, using fantasy to bring light to the problems of an increasingly technological modern society. His writings were influenced by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and his [[anthroposophy]].<ref>Peter Boccarius, ''Michael Ende: Der Anfang der Geschichte'', M\u00fcnchen: Nymphenburger, 1990. {{ISBN|3-485-00622-X}}.

A theme of his work was the loss of fantasy and magic in the modern world.<ref>http://www.rossipotti.de/inhalt/literaturlexikon/autoren/ende_michael.html</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nMichael Ende had been fascinated by Japan since his childhood. He loved [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s Japanese legends and ghost stories, and in 1959 he wrote a play inspired by Hearn's material. ''Die P\u00e4onienlaterne'' (The Peony Lantern) was written for radio, but never broadcast. Ende was primarily interested in Japan because of its radical otherness. The Japanese language and script were so different from Ende's native German that it seemed they were grounded in a different kind of consciousness\u2014an alternative way of seeing the world. He was particularly intrigued by the way in which everyday circumstances were shaped into intricate rituals, such as the tea ceremony. There was, he realized, a sharp contrast between the traditions of ancient Japan and its industry-oriented modern-day society.\n\nEnde won a devoted following in Japan, and by 1993 over two million copies of ''Momo'' and ''The Neverending Story'' had been sold in Japan. \n\nIn 1986 Michael Ende was invited to attend the annual congress of the JBBY (Japanese Committee for International Children's Literature) in Tokyo. He gave a lecture on \"Eternal Child-likeness\"\u2014the first detailed explanation of his artistic vision.\n1989 marked the opening of the exhibition ''Michael and Edgar Ende'' in Tokyo. The exhibition was subsequently shown in Otsu, Miyazaki, Nagasaki, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuyama. At the invitation of ''Shimbun'', a Japanese newspaper, Michael Ende attended the opening and spent two months touring Japan. It was his third trip accompanied by the Japanese-born Mariko Sato, whom he married in September 1989. The following year an archive devoted to Michael Ende was established at Kurohime Dowakan, a museum in the Japanese city of Shinano-machi. Ende donated letters and other personal items to the collection. On 23 October 1992 Michael Ende made his final trip to Japan. In the course of their three-week visit Michael Ende and Mariko Sato-Ende visited the Dowakan museum, joined Ende's Japanese publishers, Iwanami, in celebrating the millionth sale of Momo, and travelled to Kanazawa and Hamamatsu and a number of other cities that were new to Ende.<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/mariko-sato-and-japan</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn New Year's Eve 1952, Michael Ende met the actress [[Ingeborg Hoffmann]] during a party with friends. According to Ende, he was standing at an ivy-covered counter serving as barman, when Hoffmann strode towards him, looking \"flame-haired, fiery and chic\". She declaimed: \"Leaning up against the ivy-covered wall / Of this old terrace\"; \"[[Eduard M\u00f6rike|M\u00f6rike]]\", Ende said instantly, recognizing the quote. Hoffmann, eight years his senior, made a big impression on Ende. She in turn was intrigued by his literary cultivation and artistic inclinations.<ref name=\"ingeborg-hoffmann\">http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/ingeborg-hoffmann</ref> They began a relationship that led to their marriage in 1964 in Rome, Italy, and ended with Ingeborg Hoffmann's sudden and unexpected death in 1985 from a [[pulmonary embolism]]; she was 63 years old.\n\nHoffmann influenced Ende profoundly. In addition to assisting with getting his first major manuscript published, Hoffmann worked with him on his others, reading them and discussing them with him. Hoffman also influenced Ende's life in other ways. She encouraged Ende to join the Humanistic Union, an organization committed to furthering humanist values. Together they campaigned for human rights, protested against rearmament, and worked towards [[peace]]. Thanks to Ingeborg Hoffmann's numerous contacts, Michael Ende was introduced to a variety of cabaret groups. In 1955, Therese Angeloff, head of Die kleinen Fische (the 'Little Fish' cabaret), commissioned Ende to write a piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Friedrich Schiller's death. Ende produced a sketch in which a statue of Schiller was interviewed about newsworthy issues, and replied with quotes from Schiller's work. \"There was rapturous applause, and commissions arrived from other cabarets too.\" Michael Ende began to compose sketches, chansons and monologues.<ref name=\"ingeborg-hoffmann\"/>\n\nFor fourteen years, Ende and Hoffmann, who greatly admired [[Culture of Italy|Italian culture]], lived just outside Rome in [[Genzano di Roma|Genzano]], Italy, in a house they called Casa Liocorno (\"The Unicorn\"). It was there that Ende wrote most of the novel ''Momo''. Following the death of his wife, Ende sold the home in Genzano and returned to Munich. \n\nHe married a second time in 1989, the Japanese woman Mariko Sato, and they remained married until his death.<ref name=biografie/> He first met Mariko Sato in 1976. Sato had moved from Japan to Germany in 1974 and was working for the [[International Youth Library]] in [[Munich]]. After their meeting at the Bologna Children's Book Fair, Sato translated some of Ende's books into Japanese<ref>https://www.planet-schule.de/wissenspool/autoren-erzaehlen/inhalt/hintergrund/michael-ende.html</ref> and helped answer some of his questions about Japanese culture. From 1977 to 1980 Michael Ende and Mariko Sato worked together to produce a German translation of ten fairy tales by Japanese writer Kenji Miyazawa. The German text was never published, but the working partnership turned into a friendship. Mariko Sato accompanied him on a number of trips to Japan. The first trip took place in 1977 and included visits to Tokyo and Kyoto. For the first time Ende was able to experience Kabuki and Noh theatre, and was greatly impressed by traditional Japanese drama. Michael Ende had no children.\n\n==Death==\nIn June 1994, Ende was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Over the next few months he underwent various treatments, but the disease progressed. He ultimately succumbed to the disease in Filderstadt, Germany, on 28 August 1995.<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/illness-and-death</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\nMichael Ende's works include:\n(Note \u2013 original titles are listed in German, followed by the English translation of the title in captions.

He is best known for his epic fantasy ''[[The Neverending Story]]''; other famous works include ''[[Momo (novel)|Momo]]'' and ''[[Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver]]''. His works have been translated into more than 40 languages, sold more than 35 million copies,<ref>http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/autordetail-seite/michael-ende-87/</ref> and adapted as motion pictures, stage plays, operas and audio books. Ende is one of the most popular and famous German authors of the 20th century, mostly due to the enormous success of his children's fiction. He was not strictly a children's writer, however, as he wrote books for adults too.\nEnde's writing could be described as a surreal mixture of reality and fantasy.\n\n==Early life==\nEnde was born 12 November 1929 in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[Bavaria]], the only child of the [[surrealism|surrealist]] painter [[Edgar Ende]] and Luise Bartholom\u00e4 Ende, a physiotherapist (Coby).{{huh|date=September 2016}} In 1935, when Michael was six, the Ende family moved to the \"artists' quarter of [[Schwabing]]\" in Munich (Haase).{{huh|date=September 2016}} Growing up in this rich artistic and literary environment influenced Ende's later writing.\n\nIn 1936, his father's work was declared \"degenerate\" and banned by the Nazi party, so Edgar Ende was forced to work in secret.<ref name=biografie>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/michael-ende/biografie/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702212212/http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/michael-ende/biografie/ |archive-date=2016-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The horrors of [[World War II]] heavily influenced Ende's childhood. He was twelve years old when the first air raid took place above Munich. He reflected:\n<blockquote>Our street was consumed by flames. The fire didn't crackle; it roared. The flames were roaring. I remember singing and careering through the blaze like a drunkard. I was in the grip of a kind of euphoria. I still don't truly understand it, but I was almost tempted to cast myself into the fire like a moth into the light. </blockquote>\nHe was horrified by the [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|1943 Hamburg bombing]], which he experienced while visiting his paternal uncle. At the first available opportunity his uncle put him on a train back to Munich. There, Ende attended the Maximillians Gymnasium in Munich until schools were closed as the air raids intensified and pupils were evacuated. Ende returned to [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], where he was billeted in a boarding-house, Haus Kramerhof and later in Haus Roseneck. It was there that his interest in poetry was awakened. As well as writing his own poetry, he began to study poetical movements and styles. A good deal of modern poetry was banned at the time, so he studied the Romantic poet [[Novalis]], whose ''Hymns to the Night'' left a great impression on him.\n\nIn 1944, Edgar Ende's studio at no. 90 Kaulbachstra\u00dfe, Munich went up in flames. Over two hundred and fifty paintings and sketches were destroyed, as well as all his prints and etchings. {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernst Buchner (historian)|de|3=Ernst Buchner (Kunsthistoriker)|lt=Ernst Buchner}}, Director of Public Art for Bavaria, was still in possession of a number of Ende's paintings, and they survived the raids. After the bombing, Luise Ende was relocated to the Munich district of Solln. In 1945 Edgar Ende was taken prisoner by the Americans and released soon after the war.\n\nIn 1945, German youths as young as fourteen were drafted into the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' and sent to war against the advancing Allied armies. Three of Michael Ende's classmates were killed on their first day of action. Ende was also drafted, but he tore up his call-up papers and joined a Bavarian resistance movement founded to sabotage the SS's declared intention to defend Munich until the \"bitter end\". He served as a courier for the group for the remainder of the war.\n\nIn 1946, Michael Ende's grammar school re-opened, and he attended classes for a year, following which the financial support of family friends allowed him to complete his high-school education at a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf School]] in [[Stuttgart]]. This seemingly charitable gesture was motivated by more self-interest: Ende had fallen in love with a girl three years his senior, and her parents funded his two-year stay in Stuttgart to keep the pair apart. It was at this time that he first began to write stories (\"Michael,\" par. 3).{{huh|date=September 2016}} He aspired to be a \"dramatist,\" but wrote mostly short stories and poems (Haase).{{huh|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nDuring his time in Stuttgart, Ende first encountered [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] and [[Dada]]ist writing and began schooling himself in literature. He studied [[Theodor D\u00e4ubler]], [[Yvan Goll]], [[Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler]] and [[Alfred Mombert]], but his real love was the poetry of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Stefan George]] and [[Georg Trakl]]. He also made his first attempts at acting, performing with friends in Stuttgart's America House. He was involved in productions of [[Chekhov]]'s one-act comedy \"The Bear\", in which he played the principal role, and in the German premiere of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s \"[[Orpheus]]\". Ende's first play \"Denn die Stunde dr\u00e4ngt (As Time is Running Out)\" dates to this period. It was dedicated to [[Hiroshima]], and was never performed.\n\nEnde decided that he wanted to be a playwright, but financial considerations ruled out a university degree, so in 1948 he auditioned for the [[Otto Falckenberg School of the Performing Arts]] in Munich and was granted a two-year scholarship (Haase).\nOn leaving drama school, his first job as an actor took him to a provincial theatre company in Schleswig-Holstein. The troupe travelled from town to town by bus, usually performing on makeshift stages, surrounded by beer, smoke and the clatter of skittles from nearby bowling alleys. The acting was a disappointment, he usually had to play old men and malicious schemers, and had barely enough time to memorize his lines. Despite the frustrations and disappointments of his early acting career, Ende came to value his time in the provinces as a valuable learning experience that endowed him with a practical, down-to-earth approach to his work: \"It was a good experience, a healthy experience. Anyone interested in writing should be made to do that sort of thing. It doesn't have to be restricted to acting. It could be any kind of practical activity like cabinet making\u2014learning how to construct a cabinet in which the doors fit properly.\" In Ende's view, practical training had the potential to be more useful than a literary degree.\n\nThanks to the numerous contacts of his girlfriend [[Ingeborg Hoffmann]], Michael Ende was introduced to a variety of cabaret groups. In 1955, {{Interlanguage link multi|Therese Angeloff|de}}, head of {{Interlanguage link multi|Die kleinen Fische|de}} (the 'Little Fish' cabaret), commissioned Ende to write a piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s death. Ende produced a sketch in which a statue of Schiller was interviewed about newsworthy issues, and replied with quotes from Schiller's work. \"There was rapturous applause, and commissions arrived from other cabarets too.\" Michael Ende began to compose sketches, chansons and monologues. He also worked as a film critic during the 1950s.<ref>https://www.inhaltsangabe.de/autoren/ende/</ref>\n\n===Commercial success: writing ''Jim Knopf''===\nIn the late 1950s, Ende wrote his first novel ''Jim Button''.\n{{Quote|I sat down at my desk and wrote: \"The country in which the engine-driver, Luke, lived was called Morrowland. It was a rather small country.\" Once I'd written the two lines, I hadn't a clue how the third line might go. I didn't start out with a concept or a plan\u2014I just left myself drift from one sentence and one thought to the next. That's how I discovered that writing could be an adventure. The story carried on growing, new characters started appearing, and to my astonishment different plotlines began to weave together. The manuscript was getting longer all the time and was already much more than a picture book. I finally wrote the last sentence ten months later, and a great stack of paper had accumulated on the desk.}}\nMichael Ende always said that ideas only came to him when the logic of the story required them. On some occasions he waited a long time for inspiration to arrive.\nAt one point during the writing of ''Jim Button'' the plot reached a dead end. Jim and Luke were stuck among black rocks and their tank engine couldn't go any further. Ende was at a loss to think of a way out of the adventure, but cutting the episode struck him as disingenuous. Three weeks later he was about to shelve the novel when suddenly he had an idea\u2014the steam from the tank engine could freeze and cover the rocks in snow, thus saving his characters from their scrape. \"In my case, writing is primarily a question of patience,\" he once commented.<ref name=birth>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/a-famous-first-line-that-gave-birth-to-a-novel</ref>\n\nAfter nearly a year the five hundred pages of manuscript were complete.\nOver the next eighteen months he sent the manuscript to ten different publishers, but they all responded that it was \"Unsuitable for our list\" or \"Too long for children\". In the end he began to lose hope and toyed with the idea of throwing away the script. He eventually tried it at a small family publishing-house, K. {{Interlanguage link multi|Thienemann Verlag|de}} in Stuttgart. Michael Ende's manuscript was accepted by company director Lotte Weitbrecht who liked the story. Her only stipulation was that the manuscript had to be published as two separate books.\n\nThe first of the ''Jim Button'' novels was published in 1960. About a year later, on the morning of the announcement that his novel, ''Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver'', had won the German Prize for Children's Fiction, Ende was being sued by his landlady for seven months' rent backpayment. With the prize money of five thousand marks, Michael Ende's financial situation improved substantially and his writing career began in earnest. After the awards ceremony, he embarked on his first reading tour, and within a year, the first ''Jim Knopf'' book was also nominated for the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] and received the Berlin Literary Prize for Youth Fiction.\nThe second ''Jim Knopf'' novel, ''Jim Button and the Wild Thirteen'', was published in 1962. Both books were serialized on radio and TV, and the [[Augsburger Puppenkiste]] famously adapted the novels in a version filmed by Hesse's broadcasting corporation. The print-runs sold out so rapidly that K. Thienemanns could barely keep up. Translations into numerous foreign languages soon followed.<ref name=birth/>\n\n===Writing style and themes===\nEnde claimed, \"It is for this child in me, and in all of us, that I tell my stories\", and that \"[my books are] for any child between 80 and 8 years\" (qtd. Senick 95, 97). He often expressed frustration over being perceived as a children's writer exclusively, considering that his purpose was to speak of cultural problems and spiritual wisdom to people of all ages. Especially in Germany, Ende was accused by some critics of [[escapism]].<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/escapism-censured</ref><ref>https://www.welt.de/kultur/article5174581/Michael-Endes-Buecher-waren-Opium-fuer-Kinder.html</ref> He wrote in 1985:\n\n<blockquote>One may enter the literary parlor via just about any door, be it the prison door, the madhouse door, or the brothel door. There is but one door one may not enter it through, which is the nursery door. The critics will never forgive you such. The great [[Rudyard Kipling]] is one to have suffered this. I keep wondering to myself what this peculiar contempt towards anything related to childhood is all about.<ref>\"''Man darf von jeder T\u00fcr aus in den literarischen Salon treten, aus der Gef\u00e4ngnist\u00fcr, aus der Irrenhaust\u00fcr oder aus der Bordellt\u00fcr. Nur aus einer T\u00fcr darf man nicht kommen, aus der Kinderzimmert\u00fcr. Das vergibt einem die Kritik nicht. Das bekam schon der gro\u00dfe Rudyard Kipling zu sp\u00fcren. Ich frage mich immer, womit das eigentlich zu tun hat, woher diese eigent\u00fcmliche Verachtung alles dessen herr\u00fchrt, was mit dem Kind zu tun hat.''{{-\"}} [http://www.thienemann.de/me/galerie.htm Page on Michael Ende] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119045820/http://www.thienemann.de/me/galerie.htm |date=2009-11-19 }} by Thienemann, the publishing house that published most of Ende's works.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEnde's writing could be described as a surreal mixture of reality and [[fantasy]]. The reader is often invited to take a more interactive role in the story, and the worlds in his books often mirror our reality, using fantasy to bring light to the problems of an increasingly technological modern society. His writings were influenced by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and his [[anthroposophy]].<ref>Peter Boccarius, ''Michael Ende: Der Anfang der Geschichte'', M\u00fcnchen: Nymphenburger, 1990. {{ISBN|3-485-00622-X}}. German.</ref><ref>[http://www.michaelende.com/bio.php?id=10&lang=de Michael Ende biographical notes], \"Michael Ende und die magischen Weltbilder\" (German). \"...es sei nicht nur die Steinersche Anthroposophie gewesen, die Michael Endes Weltsicht gepr\u00e4gt habe.\" (\"...it was not only Steiner's anthroposophy that defined Michael Ende's world view.\") Accessed 2008-09-08</ref> Ende was also known as a proponent of economic reform, and claimed to have had the concept of aging money, or [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]], in mind when writing ''Momo''. A theme of his work was the loss of fantasy and magic in the modern world.<ref>http://www.rossipotti.de/inhalt/literaturlexikon/autoren/ende_michael.html</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nMichael Ende had been fascinated by Japan since his childhood. He loved [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s Japanese legends and ghost stories, and in 1959 he wrote a play inspired by Hearn's material. ''Die P\u00e4onienlaterne'' (The Peony Lantern) was written for radio, but never broadcast. Ende was primarily interested in Japan because of its radical otherness. The Japanese language and script were so different from Ende's native German that it seemed they were grounded in a different kind of consciousness\u2014an alternative way of seeing the world. He was particularly intrigued by the way in which everyday circumstances were shaped into intricate rituals, such as the tea ceremony. There was, he realized, a sharp contrast between the traditions of ancient Japan and its industry-oriented modern-day society.\n\nEnde won a devoted following in Japan, and by 1993 over two million copies of ''Momo'' and ''The Neverending Story'' had been sold in Japan. \n\nIn 1986 Michael Ende was invited to attend the annual congress of the JBBY (Japanese Committee for International Children's Literature) in Tokyo. He gave a lecture on \"Eternal Child-likeness\"\u2014the first detailed explanation of his artistic vision.\n1989 marked the opening of the exhibition ''Michael and Edgar Ende'' in Tokyo. The exhibition was subsequently shown in Otsu, Miyazaki, Nagasaki, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuyama. At the invitation of ''Shimbun'', a Japanese newspaper, Michael Ende attended the opening and spent two months touring Japan. It was his third trip accompanied by the Japanese-born Mariko Sato, whom he married in September 1989. The following year an archive devoted to Michael Ende was established at Kurohime Dowakan, a museum in the Japanese city of Shinano-machi. Ende donated letters and other personal items to the collection. On 23 October 1992 Michael Ende made his final trip to Japan. In the course of their three-week visit Michael Ende and Mariko Sato-Ende visited the Dowakan museum, joined Ende's Japanese publishers, Iwanami, in celebrating the millionth sale of Momo, and travelled to Kanazawa and Hamamatsu and a number of other cities that were new to Ende.<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/mariko-sato-and-japan</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn New Year's Eve 1952, Michael Ende met the actress [[Ingeborg Hoffmann]] during a party with friends. According to Ende, he was standing at an ivy-covered counter serving as barman, when Hoffmann strode towards him, looking \"flame-haired, fiery and chic\". She declaimed: \"Leaning up against the ivy-covered wall / Of this old terrace\"; \"[[Eduard M\u00f6rike|M\u00f6rike]]\", Ende said instantly, recognizing the quote. Hoffmann, eight years his senior, made a big impression on Ende. She in turn was intrigued by his literary cultivation and artistic inclinations.<ref name=\"ingeborg-hoffmann\">http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/ingeborg-hoffmann</ref> They began a relationship that led to their marriage in 1964 in Rome, Italy, and ended with Ingeborg Hoffmann's sudden and unexpected death in 1985 from a [[pulmonary embolism]]; she was 63 years old.\n\nHoffmann influenced Ende profoundly. In addition to assisting with getting his first major manuscript published, Hoffmann worked with him on his others, reading them and discussing them with him. Hoffman also influenced Ende's life in other ways. She encouraged Ende to join the Humanistic Union, an organization committed to furthering humanist values. Together they campaigned for human rights, protested against rearmament, and worked towards [[peace]]. Thanks to Ingeborg Hoffmann's numerous contacts, Michael Ende was introduced to a variety of cabaret groups. In 1955, Therese Angeloff, head of Die kleinen Fische (the 'Little Fish' cabaret), commissioned Ende to write a piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Friedrich Schiller's death. Ende produced a sketch in which a statue of Schiller was interviewed about newsworthy issues, and replied with quotes from Schiller's work. \"There was rapturous applause, and commissions arrived from other cabarets too.\" Michael Ende began to compose sketches, chansons and monologues.<ref name=\"ingeborg-hoffmann\"/>\n\nFor fourteen years, Ende and Hoffmann, who greatly admired [[Culture of Italy|Italian culture]], lived just outside Rome in [[Genzano di Roma|Genzano]], Italy, in a house they called Casa Liocorno (\"The Unicorn\"). It was there that Ende wrote most of the novel ''Momo''. Following the death of his wife, Ende sold the home in Genzano and returned to Munich. \n\nHe married a second time in 1989, the Japanese woman Mariko Sato, and they remained married until his death.<ref name=biografie/> He first met Mariko Sato in 1976. Sato had moved from Japan to Germany in 1974 and was working for the [[International Youth Library]] in [[Munich]]. After their meeting at the Bologna Children's Book Fair, Sato translated some of Ende's books into Japanese<ref>https://www.planet-schule.de/wissenspool/autoren-erzaehlen/inhalt/hintergrund/michael-ende.html</ref> and helped answer some of his questions about Japanese culture. From 1977 to 1980 Michael Ende and Mariko Sato worked together to produce a German translation of ten fairy tales by Japanese writer Kenji Miyazawa. The German text was never published, but the working partnership turned into a friendship. Mariko Sato accompanied him on a number of trips to Japan. The first trip took place in 1977 and included visits to Tokyo and Kyoto. For the first time Ende was able to experience Kabuki and Noh theatre, and was greatly impressed by traditional Japanese drama. Michael Ende had no children.\n\n==Death==\nIn June 1994, Ende was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Over the next few months he underwent various treatments, but the disease progressed. He ultimately succumbed to the disease in Filderstadt, Germany, on 28 August 1995.<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/illness-and-death</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\nMichael Ende's works include:\n(Note \u2013 original titles are listed in German, followed by the English translation of the title in captions.

It is coordinated by the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), a [[nonprofit organization]] formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 [[graduated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the [[time value of money]] and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.\n\nDrawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/13/how-powerball-manipulated-the-odds-to-make-a-1-5-billion-jackpot-happen |title=How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5864 billion jackpot |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Each play costs $2 or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n===Powerball begins===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n===2009: Florida became host to drawings===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010, it joined [[Mega Millions]] (along with New York) years earlier, when ''The Big Game'' added ''Mega Millions'' to its name.\n\n===2010 cross-sell expansion===\nIn March 2009, it was reported that [[New Jersey]], already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in October 2010.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]]/[[Masury, Ohio]] border sold both Mega Millions (via the [[Ohio Lottery]]) and Powerball ([[Pennsylvania]]) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |title=Penn Ohio Lottery & Deli in Sharon, PA 16146 |publisher=Local.post-gazette.com |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203254/http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Illinois]] joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n===2012 format change===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.)

Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n===Prizes and odds===\n\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |title=Powerball - How To Play |publisher=Powerball.com |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115222858/http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |archive-date=January 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\n\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n===Secondary prizes===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n==Notable wins==\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.

It is coordinated by the [[Multi-State Lottery Association]] (MUSL), a [[nonprofit organization]] formed by an agreement with US lotteries. Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 [[graduated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the [[time value of money]] and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.\n\nHowever, there were new changes to the game! Starting Sunday April 5 when the drawing occurs on Wednesday April 8, if anyone wins this jackpot, then this Powerball's annuity minimum advertised jackpot is $20 million (annuity). This annuity is paid in 30 [[gradated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. Since there was a Powerball Jackpot winner that matched all 5 numbers 48, 54, 39, 2, 37 and the Powerball Number 5 in New Jersey on Wednesday April 8, 2020, then this game had to reset to $20 million dollars!\n\nDrawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]. Since October 7, 2015, the game has used a 5/69 (white balls) + 1/26 (Powerballs) matrix from which winning numbers are chosen, resulting in odds of 1 in 292,201,338 of winning a jackpot per play.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/01/13/how-powerball-manipulated-the-odds-to-make-a-1-5-billion-jackpot-happen |title=How Powerball manipulated the odds to create a $1.5864 billion jackpot |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 13, 2016}}</ref> Each play costs $2 or $3 with the ''Power Play'' option.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n===Powerball begins===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n===2009: Florida became host to drawings===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010, it joined [[Mega Millions]] (along with New York) years earlier, when ''The Big Game'' added ''Mega Millions'' to its name.\n\n===2010 cross-sell expansion===\nIn March 2009, it was reported that [[New Jersey]], already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in October 2010.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]]/[[Masury, Ohio]] border sold both Mega Millions (via the [[Ohio Lottery]]) and Powerball ([[Pennsylvania]]) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |title=Penn Ohio Lottery & Deli in Sharon, PA 16146 |publisher=Local.post-gazette.com |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203254/http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Illinois]] joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n===2012 format change===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during [[Hurricane Michael]], a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-ran-million-powerball-drawing-out-town</ref>\n\nThe double matrices and probabilities in the game's history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Starting date\n!Pick 5 White Balls from Field of\n!Pick 1 Red Ball from Field of\n!Jackpot chance\n!''Power Play'' multiplier\n|-\n|April 22, 1992\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:54,979,154\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|November 5, 1997\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|March 7, 2001\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1x-5x\n|-\n|October 9, 2002\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:120,526,769\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|August 28, 2005\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:146,107,961\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 7, 2009\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:195,249,054\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 15, 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|-\n|January 19, 2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|October 7, 2015 <ref name=\"cnbc2015\">[https://nddb.coop/ccnddb/1024 Odds are, you won't like this Powerball story]{{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:292,201,338\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x; 10x\u2021\n|}\n\n\u2020''Power Play'' was introduced in 2001.<br />\n\u202110\u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million.<ref name=LotteryWorld2015/>\n\nWhile Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.\n\n===Power Play===\nFor an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n===Prizes and odds===\n\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\n\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n===Secondary prizes===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n==Notable wins==\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.

He previously played for the [[Oakland Athletics]], [[Toronto Blue Jays]], [[Cleveland Indians]], and [[Atlanta Braves]]. He was initially drafted by the [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[2007 Major League Baseball Draft|2007 MLB draft]] after playing [[college baseball]] at [[Auburn University]]. Donaldson made his MLB debut with the Athletics in 2010 as a catcher, progressing with the team, switching positions to third base, and eventually becoming an All-Star in the [[2014 MLB season]].\n\nAfter being traded to the Blue Jays, Donaldson was voted the [[American League]]'s [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] for the [[2015 Major League Baseball season|2015 MLB season]] and was named as a starter to the [[2015 MLB All-Star Game]], earning the most fan votes obtained by a player in the process. Donaldson also won the [[Silver Slugger Award]] and led the American League in RBIs (runs batted in) and runs scored. He was traded to the Indians in August 2018, and then signed as a free agent with the Braves in November 2018. After a very successful year with the Braves in 2019, Donaldson agreed to a 4-year deal with the Minnesota Twins on January 14, 2020.\n\n==Amateur career==\n===High school===\nBorn in [[Pensacola, Florida]], Donaldson attended [[Pace High School (Florida)|Pace High School]] in [[Pace, Florida]] for his sophomore year and played varsity baseball, before his mother, Lisa, moved him to [[Faith Academy (Mobile, Alabama)|Faith Academy]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]] to reunite him with his friend, [[P.

In his sophomore season, Donaldson hit .276 and led the team with ten home runs; he also threw out 15 of 38 base stealers and had seven pickoffs. In the summer of 2006, Donaldson played for the [[Harwich Mariners]] of the [[Cape Cod Baseball League]] where he was an All-Star and hit .302.

These numbers included cartoon studio production numbers, [[Vitaphone]] release numbers, [[List of Warner Bros. cartoons with Blue Ribbon reissues|Blue Ribbon]] re-release numbers, and [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] certificate numbers. Not all of these number types were listed in the title cards of every cartoon and the numbering schemes were sometimes inconsistent. For example, until 1943 cartoons listed Vitaphone release numbers but not cartoon studio production numbers. These release numbers, in turn, increased to 9999 but then restarted at 1. Complicating matters was the Warner Bros. Blue Ribbon re-release program, in which some cartoons were re-released in theaters with new title cards that often removed original production credits and substituted production or release numbers with new re-release numbers. In many cases, the Blue Ribbon releases are the only available prints of a cartoon, making it challenging to discern these cartoons' correct original production information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/fieldguide.html |title=Field Guide To Titles And Credits |last=Mackey |first=Dave |date=2013-03-26 |access-date=2016-08-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326071004/http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/fieldguide.html |archivedate=2013-03-26 }}</ref>\n\n'''In the list below, Blue Ribbon re-release numbers are noted with \"BR\" and Vitaphone release numbers are noted with \"VP\".'''\n\n==1950==\nStarting this year, all cartoons are in Technicolor.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5px;\" | #\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Animator\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 200px;\" | Characters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Identification Numbers\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Identification Numbers (BR)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" | Release date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 400px;\" | Availability\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | {{blue ribbon}} reissue?\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" | Reissue release date\n!Notes\n|-\n|578\n|''[[Home Tweet Home]]''\n|[[Merrie Melodies|MM]]\n|[[Friz Freleng|I.

These numbers included cartoon studio production numbers, [[Vitaphone]] release numbers, [[List of Warner Bros. cartoons with Blue Ribbon reissues|Blue Ribbon]] re-release numbers, and [[Motion Picture Association of America|MPAA]] certificate numbers. Not all of these types of numbers were listed in the title cards of every cartoon and the numbering schemes were sometimes inconsistent. For example, until 1943 cartoons listed Vitaphone release numbers but not cartoon studio production numbers. These release numbers, in turn, increased to 9999 but then restarted at 1. Complicating matters was the Warner Bros. Blue Ribbon re-release program, in which some cartoons were re-released in theaters with new title cards that often removed original production credits and substituted production or release numbers with new re-release numbers. In many cases, the Blue Ribbon releases are the only available prints of a cartoon, making it challenging to discern these cartoons' correct original production information.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/fieldguide.html |title=Field Guide To Titles And Credits |last=Mackey |first=Dave |date=2013-03-26 |access-date=2016-08-17 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130326071004/http://www.davemackey.com/animation/wb/fieldguide.html |archivedate=2013-03-26 }}</ref>\n\n'''In the list below, Blue Ribbon re-release numbers are noted with \"BR\" and Vitaphone release numbers are noted with \"VP\".'''\n\n==1950==\nStarting this year, all cartoons are in Technicolor.\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 5px;\" | #\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 150px;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | Series\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Director\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Animator\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 200px;\" | Characters\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Identification Numbers\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 100px;\" | Identification Numbers (BR)\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" | Release date\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 400px;\" | Availability\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 50px;\" | {{blue ribbon}} reissue?\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"width: 125px;\" | Reissue release date\n!Notes\n|-\n|578\n|''[[Home Tweet Home]]''\n|[[Merrie Melodies|MM]]\n|[[Friz Freleng|I.

In the [[United States Congress]], the [[Vice President of the United States]] is the ''[[ex officio]]'' President of the [[United States Senate]].  In [[Massachusetts]], however, the President of the Senate is elected from and by the Senators. The President, therefore, typically comes from the majority party, and the President is then the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of that party.\n\nThe most recent President of the [[Massachusetts Senate]] was [[Harriette Chandler]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who served as acting President following Stan Rosenberg's decision in December 2017 to temporarily step down from his post while the Senate conducted investigations into allegations of sexual assault made against his husband, Bryon Hefner. Chandler moved from acting President to President of the Senate in February 2018.  She relinquished that post on 26 July 2018, and was succeeded by [[Karen Spilka]].

In the [[United States Congress]], the [[Vice President of the United States]] is the ''[[ex officio]]'' President of the [[United States Senate]].  In [[Massachusetts]], however, the President of the Senate is elected from and by the Senators. The President, therefore, typically comes from the majority party, and the President is then the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of that party.\n\nThe most recent President of the [[Massachusetts Senate]] was [[Harriette Chandler]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] who served as acting President following Stan Rosenberg's decision in December 2017 to temporarily step down from his post while the Senate conducted investigations into allegations of sexual assault made against his husband, Bryon Hefner. Chandler moved from acting President to President of the Senate in February 2018.  She relinquished that post on 26 July 2018, and was succeeded by [[Karen Spilka]].

A four-time winner of the Armstrong 500, the race that became the prestigious [[Bathurst 1000]] and a four-time [[Australian Touring Car Championship|Australian Touring Car Champion]], Jane was well known for his chain of [[Tire|tyre]] retailers, [[Bob Jane T-Marts]]. Jane was inducted into the [[V8 Supercars Hall of Fame]] in 2000.\n\n==Early life==\nBob Jane grew up in [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], an inner-city suburb of [[Melbourne]]. His passion for racing began in the early 1950s as a champion bicycle rider, holding many state records before turning to four wheels. In the later 1950s, he started Bob Jane Autoland, a company that distributed parts for [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and [[Alfa Romeo]]. Through this venture, a love of cars and motor sport blossomed and he first entered competitive racing in Australia in 1956; by 1960, he was racing with some of Australia's top sedan drivers.\n\n==Racing career==\nIn 1961, Jane and co-driver [[Harry Firth]] won the [[Bathurst 1000|Armstrong 500]] at [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit|Phillip Island]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], driving a [[Mercedes-Benz W111|Mercedes-Benz 220SE]]. Jane and Firth won the race again the following year, the last before the event moved to [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mount Panorama]] at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[New South Wales]], retaining the Armstrong 500 name.<ref name=\"firth\">{{cite news |last1=Fogarty |first1=Mark |title=Harry Firth paved the way for modern race teams |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/motorsport/harry-firth-paved-the-way-for-modern-race-teams-20140429-zr1ew.html |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=29 April 2014 |language=en}}</ref> Jane, driving for the [[Ford Works Team (Australia)|Ford works team]], won a further two Armstrong 500s at the new venue, the first with Firth in 1963 and the second in 1964 with George Reynolds as co-driver.<ref name=\"foxsports\">{{cite news |title=Bathurst 1000 history: Armstrong 500, Shannons Goodwood Revival |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/how-far-bathurst-1000-has-come-since-days-of-mini-coopers-vauxhalls-and-brocky/news-story/15e08eb26fd1de90dab9862fd984a447 |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=Fox Sports |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref name=\"reynolds\">{{cite news |title=Vale: George Reynolds |url=https://rallysportmag.com/vale-george-reynolds/ |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=RallySport Magazine |date=14 March 2012}}</ref> Despite the change of venue, Jane is officially credited with winning Australia's most famous endurance race four times in a row, something no other driver, not even nine-time race winner [[Peter Brock]], has ever done.\n\nJane won the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] (now known as the [[V8 Supercars Championship]]) in [[1962 Australian Touring Car Championship|1962]], [[1963 Australian Touring Car Championship|1963]], [[1971 Australian Touring Car Championship|1971]] and [[1972 Australian Touring Car Championship|1972]]. His 1971 ATCC win was in a [[Camaro ZL-1|Chevrolet Camaro ZL-1]] with a 427 cubic inch engine. Jane was forced by a rule change to replace the 427 engine with a 350 cubic inch engine for the 1972 championship but the Camaro still managed to beat the opposition, which included [[Allan Moffat]]'s [[Ford Boss 302 Mustang]], [[Ian Geoghegan|Ian \"Pete\" Geoghegan]]'s [[Ford XY Falcon GTHO Phase III|Super Falcon]], and [[Norm Beechey]]'s [[Holden Monaro#HT|Holden HT Monaro GTS350]]. Of the 38 races he started in the ATCC, he finished on the podium 21 times.\n\nJane also won the [[1963 Australian GT Championship]] at the wheel of a [[Jaguar E-type]], and the Marlboro Sports Sedan Series, in both 1974 and 1975, at his own [[Calder Park Raceway]] driving a [[Holden Monaro#HQ|Holden Monaro GTS 350]] (at times he also drove his [[Repco#Repco-Holden Formula 5000 engine|Repco V8]] powered [[Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1]] which was mostly driven by [[John Harvey (racing driver)|John Harvey]]).\n\nJane retired from competitive motor racing at the end of 1981 due to [[sciatica]]. At the time of his retirement he had been driving a 6.0 litre [[Chevrolet Monza]] in the [[Australian Sports Sedan Championship]]. After giving up driving, Jane asked touring car star Peter Brock to drive the Monza in the re-formed [[Australian GT Championship]]. Brock raced the car in 1982 and 1983 before Jane sold the car in early 1984 to Re-Car owner Allan Browne.\n\n==Bob Jane T-Marts==\nIn 1965, Jane opened the first Bob Jane T-Marts store in Melbourne. The company remains an independent, family-owned business to this day; Bob's son, Rodney Jane, is the current CEO. In 2011, 81-year-old Jane resigned as chairman of T-Marts citing difficulties in the relationship with his son Rodney.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carsguide.com.au/news-and-reviews/car-news/bob_jane_resigns|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120730175821/http://www.carsguide.com.au/news-and-reviews/car-news/bob_jane_resigns|url-status=dead|title=Bob Jane resigns - carsguide.com.au|date=30 July 2012|archivedate=30 July 2012|website=Archive.today|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Bob Jane T-Marts held the [[naming rights]] sponsorship for the [[Bathurst 1000]], the race Jane dominated early in his career. The company also held the naming rights to the former [[Bob Jane Stadium]], home of [[South Melbourne FC]].\n\nBob Jane T-Marts is the only major tyre retailer in Australia who do not sell retread tyres. Jane's personal reason for this is that his second eldest daughter Georgina had died in a car accident in 1991 due to a retreaded tyre blowing out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/bob-janes-hard-road/story-e6frf7kx-1111112715266|title=Bob Jane's Hard Road|website=Heraldsun.com.au|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nHaving lost control of Bob Jane T-Marts, Jane attempted to create a new tyre business using his name. It was blocked by son Rodney in court which also ruled Jane pay legal costs. In May 2015, his Diggers Rest farm was seized by the state sheriff in order to settle the outstanding costs.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150523022625/http://velocityemag.com/bob-janes-farm-seized-in-legal-wrangle-with-son/]</ref>\n\n==Contributions to Australian motorsport==\n\n===Australian Grand Prix===\nFrom 1980 to 1984, the [[Australian Grand Prix]] was held at his Calder Park Raceway in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, Jane taking over the promoting and staging of the Grand Prix in the hope of Calder Park being granted a round of the [[Formula One World Championship]] (an ambitious plan at best as Calder was a 1.6&nbsp;km long circuit which the faster cars lapped in less than 40 seconds). The [[1980 Australian Grand Prix|1980 Grand Prix]] was open to [[Formula 5000]], [[Formula Pacific]] and [[Formula One]] cars and was won by Australia's [[1980 Formula One season|1980 Formula One World Champion]] [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] driving his World Championship winning [[Williams FW07B]]-[[Cosworth DFV|Ford]]. Second home was fellow F1 driver [[Bruno Giacomelli]] driving his [[Alfa Romeo 179]], with [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] F1 driver [[Didier Pironi]] finishing 3rd, driving an [[Elfin MR8]] [[Formula 5000]] for leading Australian team [[Elfin Sports Cars|Ansett Team Elfin]].\n\nFrom 1981 until 1984 the races were run under [[Formula Atlantic|Formula Mondial]] regulations and Jane succeeded in attracting many of the best Formula One drivers of the era. Each race from 1981-1984 was won by those driving the popular [[Ralt|Ralt RT4]]-[[Cosworth#The BDA series|Ford]].\n\nThe [[1981 Australian Grand Prix]] was won by future F1 driver [[Roberto Moreno]] from [[Brazil]]. Finishing second, also in an RT4 was [[1981 Formula One season|1981 World Champion]] [[Nelson Piquet]] (Brazil) with Australian [[Geoff Brabham]] finishing 3rd in his RT4. Alan Jones and Ligier's [[Jacques Laffite]] also participated in the race, though both failed to finish. The 1981 race was the first time since [[1968 Australian Grand Prix|1968]] that the AGP had two or more, current or past World Champions, on the starting grid. On that occasion, [[Jim Clark]] (1st), [[Graham Hill]] (3rd), [[Denny Hulme]] (9th), and Australia's own triple World Champion [[Jack Brabham]] (DNF) participated as the race was part of the popular off-season [[1968 Tasman Series|Tasman Series]].\n\nFor the [[1982 Australian Grand Prix]], Jane again attracted F1 drivers in Piquet, Laffite, the then retired Jones, plus future Formula One World Champion [[Alain Prost]]. [[Frenchman]] Prost won the 100 lap race from Laffite and 1981 winner Roberto Moreno. When Prost later won his second AGP in [[Adelaide]] in [[1986 Australian Grand Prix|1986]] to win his second of four Formula One World Championships, he became the only driver to ever win the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non-championship formats.\n\nThe [[1983 Australian Grand Prix|1983 race]], while only attracting one current F1 driver in Jacques Laffite, as well as Alan Jones, who had made an abortive F1 comeback earlier in the year, did attract 24 entries (mostly the Ford powered RT4), including former winner Moreno, Geoff Brabham and future F1 driver [[Allen Berg]]. Moreno won his second AGP from local drivers [[John Smith (racing driver)|John Smith]] and Laffite. Geoff Brabham finished 4th with Jones in 5th and [[Charlie O'Brien (racing driver)|Charlie O'Brien]]. Reigning [[Australian Drivers' Championship|Australian Drivers' Champion]] [[Alfredo Costanzo]] led the race early in his [[Tiga Race Cars|Tiga FA81]] before suffering a differential failure on lap 25. Moreno would later claim that had 'Alfie' not retired then he would likely have won as he didn't believe he would have caught the Australian. The 1983 race was the last time the Grand Prix was included as a round of the Australian Drivers' Championship.\n\nDuring 1984 it was announced that from 1985, the Australian Grand Prix would be held on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Streets of Adelaide]] and would be the 16th and final round of the [[1985 Formula One season]], giving the Grand Prix \"World Championship\" status for the first time in its history. Despite this, Jane was still able to successfully attract current Formula One drivers to participate in the [[1984 Australian Grand Prix]]. Headlining the 'imports' was three time (including [[1984 Formula One season|1984]]) World Champion [[Niki Lauda]], and [[1982 Formula One season|1982]] World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]]. Joining them were 1984 Ligier drivers [[Andrea de Cesaris]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Hesnault]] and 1981 and 1983 AGP winner Roberto Moreno to face off against local stars Costanzo and [[1984 Australian Drivers' Championship|1984 Gold Star]] champion [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]. Moreno would win his 3rd AGP in 4 years from Rosberg, who fought back from a bad start and a collision another car, with de Cesaris putting in the drive of the race to finish 3rd after starting early from the pit lane and being almost half a lap down when he took the green flag.\n\n===NASCAR===\nJane is credited with bringing [[stock car racing]] to Australia. Long resistant to oval racing (seeing it as dull and monotonous when compared to circuit racing, although speedway ([[Dirt track racing]]), held on smaller \u00bc or \u2153 mile oval tracks, has been popular in Australia since the 1920s), Australian motorsport fans finally had their own [[NASCAR]]-style high banked [[superspeedway]] when Jane spent [[Australian dollar|A$]]54 million building the [[Calder Park Thunderdome|Thunderdome]] on the grounds of Calder Park Raceway. The 1.801&nbsp;km (1.119&nbsp;mi) Thunderdome, with 24\u00b0 banking in the turns, was built as a tri-oval with Jane modelling the track on the famous [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]].\n\nOpened on 3 August 1987, the Thunderdome played host to the first ever [[NASCAR]] event held outside North America on 28 February 1988 with the [[1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500|Goodyear NASCAR 500]]. Several prominent drivers from the [[United States]] came to Australia for this race including [[Alabama Gang]] members [[Bobby Allison]] and [[Neil Bonnett]], along with [[Kyle Petty]], [[Michael Waltrip]], [[Dave Marcis]], and others from the [[Winston West Series]]. Bonnett, who had won the [[Winston Cup|Winston Cup's]] [[1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series#Pontiac Excitement 400|Pontiac Excitement 400]] at the [[Richmond International Raceway]] the previous weekend, and Allison, who had won the [[1988 Daytona 500]] just one week prior to that, dominated the race, swapping the lead several times on a hot summer afternoon in which cabin temperatures were reported to reach over 57\u00b0 Celsius (135\u00b0 Fahrenheit). Bonnett won the 280 lap race from Allison with Dave Marcis finishing 3rd.\n\nThe race was marred by an early multi-car crash in turns 3 and 4 involving 8 cars including the [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] of local touring car champion [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]], and the [[Oldsmobile 88#1986\u20131991|Oldsmobile]] of [[Allan Grice]] who, after running out of brakes, couldn't slow down coming off the back straight and ran into the wreck at speed. Grice, whose car was a [[write-off]], suffered a broken collarbone and was taken to hospital for x-rays.\n\nJane also owned the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] which features the only other paved NASCAR type oval in Australia with its half mile Speedway Super Bowl, which, unlike the Thunderdome, is a permanent part of the road circuit.\n\nIn 1992, Jane and Sydney based speedway promoter and [[ATN|Channel 7]] television commentator Mike Raymond also announced plans to turn the old half mile [[harness racing]] track that surrounded the [[Sydney Speedway|Parramatta Speedway]] in [[Sydney]] into a paved oval for NASCAR and the Australian [[Australian Stock Car Auto Racing|AUSCAR]] category, giving Australia a third paved oval speedway. Unfortunately however the project never got past the planning stage.\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 23 February 2007, Jane was granted a 12-month intervention order against his estranged wife, Laree Jane (born 1967). At the time, she was 39 and they had been married for 20 years. He accused her of threatening to shoot him and threatening him with a kitchen knife.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/bob-jane-wins-order-against-wife-20070224-gdpjcg.html|title=Bob Jane wins order against wife|date=23 February 2007|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref> In a Victorian County Court, on 22 January 2009, a jury found Laree Jane not guilty of five charges, including assault, related to the domestic dispute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2472148.htm|title=Bob Jane's ex-wife found not guilty|date=22 January 2009|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nJane met Laree when he performed Grand Marshal duties for the [[1986 James Hardie 1000]] at Bathurst.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nJane declared [[bankruptcy]] on 8 July 2016.<ref name=\"smartco-bankrupt\">{{cite web |last1=Carmody|first1=Broede |title=Tyre king Bob Jane declares bankruptcy, says he has just $15 in the bank - SmartCompany |url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/finance/71960-tyre-king-bob-jane-declares-bankruptcy-says-he-has-just-15-in-the-bank/ |website=Smartcompany.com.au |accessdate=27 July 2016 |date=18 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 September 2018, Jane died from prostate cancer, 21 years after his diagnosis.

was an [[Australia]]n [[race car]] driver and prominent entrepreneur and business tycoon.  A four-time winner of the Armstrong 500, the race that became the prestigious [[Bathurst 1000]] and a four-time [[Australian Touring Car Championship|Australian Touring Car Champion]], Jane was well known for his chain of [[Tire|tyre]] retailers, [[Bob Jane T-Marts]]. Jane was inducted into the [[V8 Supercars Hall of Fame]] in 2000.\n\n==Early life==\nBob Jane grew up in [[Brunswick, Victoria|Brunswick]], an inner-city suburb of [[Melbourne]]. His passion for racing began in the early 1950s as a champion bicycle rider, holding many state records before turning to four wheels. In the later 1950s, he started Bob Jane Autoland, a company that distributed parts for [[Jaguar (car)|Jaguar]] and [[Alfa Romeo]]. Through this venture, a love of cars and motor sport blossomed and he first entered competitive racing in Australia in 1956; by 1960, he was racing with some of Australia's top sedan drivers.\n\n==Racing career==\nIn 1961, Jane and co-driver [[Harry Firth]] won the [[Bathurst 1000|Armstrong 500]] at [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit|Phillip Island]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], driving a [[Mercedes-Benz W111|Mercedes-Benz 220SE]]. Jane and Firth won the race again the following year, the last before the event moved to [[Mount Panorama Circuit|Mount Panorama]] at [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]], [[New South Wales]], retaining the Armstrong 500 name.<ref name=\"firth\">{{cite news |last1=Fogarty |first1=Mark |title=Harry Firth paved the way for modern race teams |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/motorsport/harry-firth-paved-the-way-for-modern-race-teams-20140429-zr1ew.html |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=29 April 2014 |language=en}}</ref> Jane, driving for the [[Ford Works Team (Australia)|Ford works team]], won a further two Armstrong 500s at the new venue, the first with Firth in 1963 and the second in 1964 with George Reynolds as co-driver.<ref name=\"foxsports\">{{cite news |title=Bathurst 1000 history: Armstrong 500, Shannons Goodwood Revival |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/motorsport/how-far-bathurst-1000-has-come-since-days-of-mini-coopers-vauxhalls-and-brocky/news-story/15e08eb26fd1de90dab9862fd984a447 |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=Fox Sports |language=en-AU}}</ref><ref name=\"reynolds\">{{cite news |title=Vale: George Reynolds |url=https://rallysportmag.com/vale-george-reynolds/ |accessdate=29 September 2018 |work=RallySport Magazine |date=14 March 2012}}</ref> Despite the change of venue, Jane is officially credited with winning Australia's most famous endurance race four times in a row, something no other driver, not even nine-time race winner [[Peter Brock]], has ever done.\n\nJane won the [[Australian Touring Car Championship]] (now known as the [[V8 Supercars Championship]]) in [[1962 Australian Touring Car Championship|1962]], [[1963 Australian Touring Car Championship|1963]], [[1971 Australian Touring Car Championship|1971]] and [[1972 Australian Touring Car Championship|1972]]. His 1971 ATCC win was in a [[Camaro ZL-1|Chevrolet Camaro ZL-1]] with a 427 cubic inch engine. Jane was forced by a rule change to replace the 427 engine with a 350 cubic inch engine for the 1972 championship but the Camaro still managed to beat the opposition, which included [[Allan Moffat]]'s [[Ford Boss 302 Mustang]], [[Ian Geoghegan|Ian \"Pete\" Geoghegan]]'s [[Ford XY Falcon GTHO Phase III|Super Falcon]], and [[Norm Beechey]]'s [[Holden Monaro#HT|Holden HT Monaro GTS350]]. Of the 38 races he started in the ATCC, he finished on the podium 21 times.\n\nJane also won the [[1963 Australian GT Championship]] at the wheel of a [[Jaguar E-type]], and the Marlboro Sports Sedan Series, in both 1974 and 1975, at his own [[Calder Park Raceway]] driving a [[Holden Monaro#HQ|Holden Monaro GTS 350]] (at times he also drove his [[Repco#Repco-Holden Formula 5000 engine|Repco V8]] powered [[Holden LJ Torana GTR XU-1]] which was mostly driven by [[John Harvey (racing driver)|John Harvey]]).\n\nJane retired from competitive motor racing at the end of 1981 due to [[sciatica]]. At the time of his retirement he had been driving a 6.0 litre [[Chevrolet Monza]] in the [[Australian Sports Sedan Championship]]. After giving up driving, Jane asked touring car star Peter Brock to drive the Monza in the re-formed [[Australian GT Championship]]. Brock raced the car in 1982 and 1983 before Jane sold the car in early 1984 to Re-Car owner Allan Browne.\n\n==Bob Jane T-Marts==\nIn 1965, Jane opened the first Bob Jane T-Marts store in Melbourne. The company remains an independent, family-owned business to this day; Bob's son, Rodney Jane, is the current CEO. In 2011, 81-year-old Jane resigned as chairman of T-Marts citing difficulties in the relationship with his son Rodney.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carsguide.com.au/news-and-reviews/car-news/bob_jane_resigns|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120730175821/http://www.carsguide.com.au/news-and-reviews/car-news/bob_jane_resigns|url-status=dead|title=Bob Jane resigns - carsguide.com.au|date=30 July 2012|archivedate=30 July 2012|website=Archive.today|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Bob Jane T-Marts held the [[naming rights]] sponsorship for the [[Bathurst 1000]], the race Jane dominated early in his career. The company also held the naming rights to the former [[Bob Jane Stadium]], home of [[South Melbourne FC]].\n\nBob Jane T-Marts is the only major tyre retailer in Australia who do not sell retread tyres. Jane's personal reason for this is that his second eldest daughter Georgina had died in a car accident in 1991 due to a retreaded tyre blowing out.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/bob-janes-hard-road/story-e6frf7kx-1111112715266|title=Bob Jane's Hard Road|website=Heraldsun.com.au|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nHaving lost control of Bob Jane T-Marts, Jane attempted to create a new tyre business using his name. It was blocked by son Rodney in court which also ruled Jane pay legal costs. In May 2015, his Diggers Rest farm was seized by the state sheriff in order to settle the outstanding costs.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20150523022625/http://velocityemag.com/bob-janes-farm-seized-in-legal-wrangle-with-son/]</ref>\n\n==Contributions to Australian motorsport==\n\n===Australian Grand Prix===\nFrom 1980 to 1984, the [[Australian Grand Prix]] was held at his Calder Park Raceway in the outer suburbs of Melbourne, Jane taking over the promoting and staging of the Grand Prix in the hope of Calder Park being granted a round of the [[Formula One World Championship]] (an ambitious plan at best as Calder was a 1.6&nbsp;km long circuit which the faster cars lapped in less than 40 seconds). The [[1980 Australian Grand Prix|1980 Grand Prix]] was open to [[Formula 5000]], [[Formula Pacific]] and [[Formula One]] cars and was won by Australia's [[1980 Formula One season|1980 Formula One World Champion]] [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] driving his World Championship winning [[Williams FW07B]]-[[Cosworth DFV|Ford]]. Second home was fellow F1 driver [[Bruno Giacomelli]] driving his [[Alfa Romeo 179]], with [[Equipe Ligier|Ligier]] F1 driver [[Didier Pironi]] finishing 3rd, driving an [[Elfin MR8]] [[Formula 5000]] for leading Australian team [[Elfin Sports Cars|Ansett Team Elfin]].\n\nFrom 1981 until 1984 the races were run under [[Formula Atlantic|Formula Mondial]] regulations and Jane succeeded in attracting many of the best Formula One drivers of the era. Each race from 1981-1984 was won by those driving the popular [[Ralt|Ralt RT4]]-[[Cosworth#The BDA series|Ford]].\n\nThe [[1981 Australian Grand Prix]] was won by future F1 driver [[Roberto Moreno]] from [[Brazil]]. Finishing second, also in an RT4 was [[1981 Formula One season|1981 World Champion]] [[Nelson Piquet]] (Brazil) with Australian [[Geoff Brabham]] finishing 3rd in his RT4. Alan Jones and Ligier's [[Jacques Laffite]] also participated in the race, though both failed to finish. The 1981 race was the first time since [[1968 Australian Grand Prix|1968]] that the AGP had two or more, current or past World Champions, on the starting grid. On that occasion, [[Jim Clark]] (1st), [[Graham Hill]] (3rd), [[Denny Hulme]] (9th), and Australia's own triple World Champion [[Jack Brabham]] (DNF) participated as the race was part of the popular off-season [[1968 Tasman Series|Tasman Series]].\n\nFor the [[1982 Australian Grand Prix]], Jane again attracted F1 drivers in Piquet, Laffite, the then retired Jones, plus future Formula One World Champion [[Alain Prost]]. [[Frenchman]] Prost won the 100 lap race from Laffite and 1981 winner Roberto Moreno. When Prost later won his second AGP in [[Adelaide]] in [[1986 Australian Grand Prix|1986]] to win his second of four Formula One World Championships, he became the only driver to ever win the Australian Grand Prix in both World Championship and non-championship formats.\n\nThe [[1983 Australian Grand Prix|1983 race]], while only attracting one current F1 driver in Jacques Laffite, as well as Alan Jones, who had made an abortive F1 comeback earlier in the year, did attract 24 entries (mostly the Ford powered RT4), including former winner Moreno, Geoff Brabham and future F1 driver [[Allen Berg]]. Moreno won his second AGP from local drivers [[John Smith (racing driver)|John Smith]] and Laffite. Geoff Brabham finished 4th with Jones in 5th and [[Charlie O'Brien (racing driver)|Charlie O'Brien]]. Reigning [[Australian Drivers' Championship|Australian Drivers' Champion]] [[Alfredo Costanzo]] led the race early in his [[Tiga Race Cars|Tiga FA81]] before suffering a differential failure on lap 25. Moreno would later claim that had 'Alfie' not retired then he would likely have won as he didn't believe he would have caught the Australian. The 1983 race was the last time the Grand Prix was included as a round of the Australian Drivers' Championship.\n\nDuring 1984 it was announced that from 1985, the Australian Grand Prix would be held on the [[Adelaide Street Circuit|Streets of Adelaide]] and would be the 16th and final round of the [[1985 Formula One season]], giving the Grand Prix \"World Championship\" status for the first time in its history. Despite this, Jane was still able to successfully attract current Formula One drivers to participate in the [[1984 Australian Grand Prix]]. Headlining the 'imports' was three time (including [[1984 Formula One season|1984]]) World Champion [[Niki Lauda]], and [[1982 Formula One season|1982]] World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]]. Joining them were 1984 Ligier drivers [[Andrea de Cesaris]] and [[Fran\u00e7ois Hesnault]] and 1981 and 1983 AGP winner Roberto Moreno to face off against local stars Costanzo and [[1984 Australian Drivers' Championship|1984 Gold Star]] champion [[John Bowe (racing driver)|John Bowe]]. Moreno would win his 3rd AGP in 4 years from Rosberg, who fought back from a bad start and a collision another car, with de Cesaris putting in the drive of the race to finish 3rd after starting early from the pit lane and being almost half a lap down when he took the green flag.\n\n===NASCAR===\nJane is credited with bringing [[stock car racing]] to Australia. Long resistant to oval racing (seeing it as dull and monotonous when compared to circuit racing, although speedway ([[Dirt track racing]]), held on smaller \u00bc or \u2153 mile oval tracks, has been popular in Australia since the 1920s), Australian motorsport fans finally had their own [[NASCAR]]-style high banked [[superspeedway]] when Jane spent [[Australian dollar|A$]]54 million building the [[Calder Park Thunderdome|Thunderdome]] on the grounds of Calder Park Raceway. The 1.801&nbsp;km (1.119&nbsp;mi) Thunderdome, with 24\u00b0 banking in the turns, was built as a tri-oval with Jane modelling the track on the famous [[Charlotte Motor Speedway]].\n\nOpened on 3 August 1987, the Thunderdome played host to the first ever [[NASCAR]] event held outside North America on 28 February 1988 with the [[1988 Goodyear NASCAR 500|Goodyear NASCAR 500]]. Several prominent drivers from the [[United States]] came to Australia for this race including [[Alabama Gang]] members [[Bobby Allison]] and [[Neil Bonnett]], along with [[Kyle Petty]], [[Michael Waltrip]], [[Dave Marcis]], and others from the [[Winston West Series]]. Bonnett, who had won the [[Winston Cup|Winston Cup's]] [[1988 NASCAR Winston Cup Series#Pontiac Excitement 400|Pontiac Excitement 400]] at the [[Richmond International Raceway]] the previous weekend, and Allison, who had won the [[1988 Daytona 500]] just one week prior to that, dominated the race, swapping the lead several times on a hot summer afternoon in which cabin temperatures were reported to reach over 57\u00b0 Celsius (135\u00b0 Fahrenheit). Bonnett won the 280 lap race from Allison with Dave Marcis finishing 3rd.\n\nThe race was marred by an early multi-car crash in turns 3 and 4 involving 8 cars including the [[Ford Thunderbird (ninth generation)|Ford Thunderbird]] of local touring car champion [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]], and the [[Oldsmobile 88#1986\u20131991|Oldsmobile]] of [[Allan Grice]] who, after running out of brakes, couldn't slow down coming off the back straight and ran into the wreck at speed. Grice, whose car was a [[write-off]], suffered a broken collarbone and was taken to hospital for x-rays.\n\nJane also owned the [[Adelaide International Raceway]] which features the only other paved NASCAR type oval in Australia with its half mile Speedway Super Bowl, which, unlike the Thunderdome, is a permanent part of the road circuit.\n\nIn 1992, Jane and Sydney based speedway promoter and [[ATN|Channel 7]] television commentator Mike Raymond also announced plans to turn the old half mile [[harness racing]] track that surrounded the [[Sydney Speedway|Parramatta Speedway]] in [[Sydney]] into a paved oval for NASCAR and the Australian [[Australian Stock Car Auto Racing|AUSCAR]] category, giving Australia a third paved oval speedway. Unfortunately however the project never got past the planning stage.\n\n==Personal life==\nOn 23 February 2007, Jane was granted a 12-month intervention order against his estranged wife, Laree Jane (born 1967). At the time, she was 39 and they had been married for 20 years. He accused her of threatening to shoot him and threatening him with a kitchen knife.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/bob-jane-wins-order-against-wife-20070224-gdpjcg.html|title=Bob Jane wins order against wife|date=23 February 2007|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref> In a Victorian County Court, on 22 January 2009, a jury found Laree Jane not guilty of five charges, including assault, related to the domestic dispute.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/01/22/2472148.htm|title=Bob Jane's ex-wife found not guilty|date=22 January 2009|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=29 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nJane met Laree when he performed Grand Marshal duties for the [[1986 James Hardie 1000]] at Bathurst.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\nJane declared [[bankruptcy]] on 8 July 2016.<ref name=\"smartco-bankrupt\">{{cite web |last1=Carmody|first1=Broede |title=Tyre king Bob Jane declares bankruptcy, says he has just $15 in the bank - SmartCompany |url=http://www.smartcompany.com.au/finance/71960-tyre-king-bob-jane-declares-bankruptcy-says-he-has-just-15-in-the-bank/ |website=Smartcompany.com.au |accessdate=27 July 2016 |date=18 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nOn 28 September 2018, Jane died from prostate cancer, 21 years after his diagnosis.

He is best known for his epic fantasy ''[[The Neverending Story]]''; other famous works include ''[[Momo (novel)|Momo]]'' and ''[[Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver]]''. His works have been translated into more than 40 languages, sold more than 35 million copies,<ref>http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/autordetail-seite/michael-ende-87/</ref> and adapted as motion pictures, stage plays, operas and audio books. Ende is one of the most popular and famous German authors of the 20th century, mostly due to the enormous success of his children's fiction. He was not strictly a children's writer, however, as he wrote books for adults too.\nEnde's writing could be described as a surreal mixture of reality and fantasy.\n\n==Early life==\nEnde was born 12 November 1929 in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[Bavaria]], the only child of the [[surrealism|surrealist]] painter [[Edgar Ende]] and Luise Bartholom\u00e4 Ende, a physiotherapist (Coby).{{huh|date=September 2016}} In 1935, when Michael was six, the Ende family moved to the \"artists' quarter of [[Schwabing]]\" in Munich (Haase).{{huh|date=September 2016}} Growing up in this rich artistic and literary environment influenced Ende's later writing.\n\nIn 1936, his father's work was declared \"degenerate\" and banned by the Nazi party, so Edgar Ende was forced to work in secret.<ref name=biografie>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/michael-ende/biografie/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702212212/http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/michael-ende/biografie/ |archive-date=2016-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The horrors of [[World War II]] heavily influenced Ende's childhood. He was twelve years old when the first air raid took place above Munich. He reflected:\n<blockquote>Our street was consumed by flames. The fire didn't crackle; it roared. The flames were roaring. I remember singing and careering through the blaze like a drunkard. I was in the grip of a kind of euphoria. I still don't truly understand it, but I was almost tempted to cast myself into the fire like a moth into the light. </blockquote>\nHe was horrified by the [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|1943 Hamburg bombing]], which he experienced while visiting his paternal uncle. At the first available opportunity his uncle put him on a train back to Munich. There, Ende attended the Maximillians Gymnasium in Munich until schools were closed as the air raids intensified and pupils were evacuated. Ende returned to [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], where he was billeted in a boarding-house, Haus Kramerhof and later in Haus Roseneck. It was there that his interest in poetry was awakened. As well as writing his own poetry, he began to study poetical movements and styles. A good deal of modern poetry was banned at the time, so he studied the Romantic poet [[Novalis]], whose ''Hymns to the Night'' left a great impression on him.\n\nIn 1944, Edgar Ende's studio at no. 90 Kaulbachstra\u00dfe, Munich went up in flames. Over two hundred and fifty paintings and sketches were destroyed, as well as all his prints and etchings. {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernst Buchner (historian)|de|3=Ernst Buchner (Kunsthistoriker)|lt=Ernst Buchner}}, Director of Public Art for Bavaria, was still in possession of a number of Ende's paintings, and they survived the raids. After the bombing, Luise Ende was relocated to the Munich district of Solln. In 1945, Edgar Ende was taken prisoner by the Americans and released soon after the war.\n\nIn 1945, German youths as young as fourteen were drafted into the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' and sent to war against the advancing Allied armies. Three of Michael Ende's classmates were killed on their first day of action. Ende was also drafted, but he tore up his call-up papers and joined a Bavarian resistance movement founded to sabotage the SS's declared intention to defend Munich until the \"bitter end\". He served as a courier for the group for the remainder of the war.\n\nIn 1946, Michael Ende's grammar school re-opened, and he attended classes for a year, following which the financial support of family friends allowed him to complete his high-school education at a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf School]] in [[Stuttgart]]. This seemingly charitable gesture was motivated by more self-interest: Ende had fallen in love with a girl three years his senior, and her parents funded his two-year stay in Stuttgart to keep the pair apart. It was at this time that he first began to write stories (\"Michael,\" par. 3).{{huh|date=September 2016}} He aspired to be a \"dramatist,\" but wrote mostly short stories and poems (Haase).{{huh|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nDuring his time in Stuttgart, Ende first encountered [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] and [[Dada]]ist writing and began schooling himself in literature. He studied [[Theodor D\u00e4ubler]], [[Yvan Goll]], [[Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler]] and [[Alfred Mombert]], but his real love was the poetry of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Stefan George]] and [[Georg Trakl]]. He also made his first attempts at acting, performing with friends in Stuttgart's America House. He was involved in productions of [[Chekhov]]'s one-act comedy \"The Bear\", in which he played the principal role, and in the German premiere of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s \"[[Orpheus]]\". Ende's first play \"Denn die Stunde dr\u00e4ngt (As Time is Running Out)\" dates to this period. It was dedicated to [[Hiroshima]], and was never performed.\n\nEnde decided that he wanted to be a playwright, but financial considerations ruled out a university degree, so in 1948 he auditioned for the [[Otto Falckenberg School of the Performing Arts]] in Munich and was granted a two-year scholarship (Haase).\nOn leaving drama school, his first job as an actor took him to a provincial theatre company in Schleswig-Holstein. The troupe travelled from town to town by bus, usually performing on makeshift stages, surrounded by beer, smoke and the clatter of skittles from nearby bowling alleys. The acting was a disappointment, he usually had to play old men and malicious schemers, and had barely enough time to memorize his lines. Despite the frustrations and disappointments of his early acting career, Ende came to value his time in the provinces as a valuable learning experience that endowed him with a practical, down-to-earth approach to his work: \"It was a good experience, a healthy experience. Anyone interested in writing should be made to do that sort of thing. It doesn't have to be restricted to acting. It could be any kind of practical activity like cabinet making\u2014learning how to construct a cabinet in which the doors fit properly.\" In Ende's view, practical training had the potential to be more useful than a literary degree.\n\nThanks to the numerous contacts of his girlfriend [[Ingeborg Hoffmann]], Michael Ende was introduced to a variety of cabaret groups. In 1955, {{Interlanguage link multi|Therese Angeloff|de}}, head of {{Interlanguage link multi|Die kleinen Fische|de}} (the 'Little Fish' cabaret), commissioned Ende to write a piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s death. Ende produced a sketch in which a statue of Schiller was interviewed about newsworthy issues, and replied with quotes from Schiller's work. \"There was rapturous applause, and commissions arrived from other cabarets too.\" Michael Ende began to compose sketches, chansons and monologues. He also worked as a film critic during the 1950s.<ref>https://www.inhaltsangabe.de/autoren/ende/</ref>\n\n===Commercial success: writing ''Jim Knopf''===\nIn the late 1950s, Ende wrote his first novel ''Jim Button''.\n{{Quote|I sat down at my desk and wrote: \"The country in which the engine-driver, Luke, lived was called Morrowland. It was a rather small country.\" Once I'd written the two lines, I hadn't a clue how the third line might go. I didn't start out with a concept or a plan\u2014I just left myself drift from one sentence and one thought to the next. That's how I discovered that writing could be an adventure. The story carried on growing, new characters started appearing, and to my astonishment different plotlines began to weave together. The manuscript was getting longer all the time and was already much more than a picture book. I finally wrote the last sentence ten months later, and a great stack of paper had accumulated on the desk.}}\nMichael Ende always said that ideas only came to him when the logic of the story required them. On some occasions he waited a long time for inspiration to arrive.\nAt one point during the writing of ''Jim Button'' the plot reached a dead end. Jim and Luke were stuck among black rocks and their tank engine couldn't go any further. Ende was at a loss to think of a way out of the adventure, but cutting the episode struck him as disingenuous. Three weeks later he was about to shelve the novel when suddenly he had an idea\u2014the steam from the tank engine could freeze and cover the rocks in snow, thus saving his characters from their scrape. \"In my case, writing is primarily a question of patience,\" he once commented.<ref name=birth>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/a-famous-first-line-that-gave-birth-to-a-novel</ref>\n\nAfter nearly a year the five hundred pages of manuscript were complete.\nOver the next eighteen months he sent the manuscript to ten different publishers, but they all responded that it was \"Unsuitable for our list\" or \"Too long for children\". In the end he began to lose hope and toyed with the idea of throwing away the script. He eventually tried it at a small family publishing-house, K. {{Interlanguage link multi|Thienemann Verlag|de}} in Stuttgart. Michael Ende's manuscript was accepted by company director Lotte Weitbrecht who liked the story. Her only stipulation was that the manuscript had to be published as two separate books.\n\nThe first of the ''Jim Button'' novels was published in 1960. About a year later, on the morning of the announcement that his novel, ''Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver'', had won the German Prize for Children's Fiction, Ende was being sued by his landlady for seven months' rent backpayment. With the prize money of five thousand marks, Michael Ende's financial situation improved substantially and his writing career began in earnest. After the awards ceremony, he embarked on his first reading tour, and within a year, the first ''Jim Knopf'' book was also nominated for the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] and received the Berlin Literary Prize for Youth Fiction.\nThe second ''Jim Knopf'' novel, ''Jim Button and the Wild Thirteen'', was published in 1962. Both books were serialized on radio and TV, and the [[Augsburger Puppenkiste]] famously adapted the novels in a version filmed by Hesse's broadcasting corporation. The print-runs sold out so rapidly that K. Thienemanns could barely keep up. Translations into numerous foreign languages soon followed.<ref name=birth/>\n\n===Writing style and themes===\nEnde claimed, \"It is for this child in me, and in all of us, that I tell my stories\", and that \"[my books are] for any child between 80 and 8 years\" (qtd. Senick 95, 97). He often expressed frustration over being perceived as a children's writer exclusively, considering that his purpose was to speak of cultural problems and spiritual wisdom to people of all ages. Especially in Germany, Ende was accused by some critics of [[escapism]].<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/escapism-censured</ref><ref>https://www.welt.de/kultur/article5174581/Michael-Endes-Buecher-waren-Opium-fuer-Kinder.html</ref> He wrote in 1985:\n\n<blockquote>One may enter the literary parlor via just about any door, be it the prison door, the madhouse door, or the brothel door. There is but one door one may not enter it through, which is the nursery door. The critics will never forgive you such. The great [[Rudyard Kipling]] is one to have suffered this. I keep wondering to myself what this peculiar contempt towards anything related to childhood is all about.<ref>\"''Man darf von jeder T\u00fcr aus in den literarischen Salon treten, aus der Gef\u00e4ngnist\u00fcr, aus der Irrenhaust\u00fcr oder aus der Bordellt\u00fcr. Nur aus einer T\u00fcr darf man nicht kommen, aus der Kinderzimmert\u00fcr. Das vergibt einem die Kritik nicht. Das bekam schon der gro\u00dfe Rudyard Kipling zu sp\u00fcren. Ich frage mich immer, womit das eigentlich zu tun hat, woher diese eigent\u00fcmliche Verachtung alles dessen herr\u00fchrt, was mit dem Kind zu tun hat.''{{-\"}} [http://www.thienemann.de/me/galerie.htm Page on Michael Ende] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119045820/http://www.thienemann.de/me/galerie.htm |date=2009-11-19 }} by Thienemann, the publishing house that published most of Ende's works.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEnde's writing could be described as a surreal mixture of reality and [[fantasy]]. The reader is often invited to take a more interactive role in the story, and the worlds in his books often mirror our reality, using fantasy to bring light to the problems of an increasingly technological modern society. His writings were influenced by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and his [[anthroposophy]].<ref>Peter Boccarius, ''Michael Ende: Der Anfang der Geschichte'', M\u00fcnchen: Nymphenburger, 1990. {{ISBN|3-485-00622-X}}. German.</ref><ref>[http://www.michaelende.com/bio.php?id=10&lang=de Michael Ende biographical notes], \"Michael Ende und die magischen Weltbilder\" (German). \"...es sei nicht nur die Steinersche Anthroposophie gewesen, die Michael Endes Weltsicht gepr\u00e4gt habe.\" (\"...it was not only Steiner's anthroposophy that defined Michael Ende's world view.\") Accessed 2008-09-08</ref> Ende was also known as a proponent of economic reform, and claimed to have had the concept of aging money, or [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]], in mind when writing ''Momo''. A theme of his work was the loss of fantasy and magic in the modern world.<ref>http://www.rossipotti.de/inhalt/literaturlexikon/autoren/ende_michael.html</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nMichael Ende had been fascinated by Japan since his childhood. He loved [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s Japanese legends and ghost stories, and in 1959 he wrote a play inspired by Hearn's material. ''Die P\u00e4onienlaterne'' (The Peony Lantern) was written for radio, but never broadcast. Ende was primarily interested in Japan because of its radical otherness. The Japanese language and script were so different from Ende's native German that it seemed they were grounded in a different kind of consciousness\u2014an alternative way of seeing the world. He was particularly intrigued by the way in which everyday circumstances were shaped into intricate rituals, such as the tea ceremony. There was, he realized, a sharp contrast between the traditions of ancient Japan and its industry-oriented modern-day society.\n\nEnde won a devoted following in Japan, and by 1993 over two million copies of ''Momo'' and ''The Neverending Story'' had been sold in Japan. \n\nIn 1986 Michael Ende was invited to attend the annual congress of the JBBY (Japanese Committee for International Children's Literature) in Tokyo. He gave a lecture on \"Eternal Child-likeness\"\u2014the first detailed explanation of his artistic vision.\n1989 marked the opening of the exhibition ''Michael and Edgar Ende'' in Tokyo. The exhibition was subsequently shown in Otsu, Miyazaki, Nagasaki, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuyama. At the invitation of ''Shimbun'', a Japanese newspaper, Michael Ende attended the opening and spent two months touring Japan. It was his third trip accompanied by the Japanese-born Mariko Sato, whom he married in September 1989. The following year an archive devoted to Michael Ende was established at Kurohime Dowakan, a museum in the Japanese city of Shinano-machi. Ende donated letters and other personal items to the collection. On 23 October 1992 Michael Ende made his final trip to Japan. In the course of their three-week visit Michael Ende and Mariko Sato-Ende visited the Dowakan museum, joined Ende's Japanese publishers, Iwanami, in celebrating the millionth sale of Momo, and travelled to Kanazawa and Hamamatsu and a number of other cities that were new to Ende.<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/mariko-sato-and-japan</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn New Year's Eve 1952, Michael Ende met the actress [[Ingeborg Hoffmann]] during a party with friends. According to Ende, he was standing at an ivy-covered counter serving as barman, when Hoffmann strode towards him, looking \"flame-haired, fiery and chic\". She declaimed: \"Leaning up against the ivy-covered wall / Of this old terrace\"; \"[[Eduard M\u00f6rike|M\u00f6rike]]\", Ende said instantly, recognizing the quote. Hoffmann, eight years his senior, made a big impression on Ende. She in turn was intrigued by his literary cultivation and artistic inclinations.<ref name=\"ingeborg-hoffmann\">http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/ingeborg-hoffmann</ref> They began a relationship that led to their marriage in 1964 in Rome, Italy, and ended with Ingeborg Hoffmann's sudden and unexpected death in 1985 from a [[pulmonary embolism]]; she was 63 years old.\n\nHoffmann influenced Ende profoundly. In addition to assisting with getting his first major manuscript published, Hoffmann worked with him on his others, reading them and discussing them with him. Hoffman also influenced Ende's life in other ways. She encouraged Ende to join the Humanistic Union, an organization committed to furthering humanist values. Together they campaigned for human rights, protested against rearmament, and worked towards [[peace]]. Thanks to Ingeborg Hoffmann's numerous contacts, Michael Ende was introduced to a variety of cabaret groups. In 1955, Therese Angeloff, head of Die kleinen Fische (the 'Little Fish' cabaret), commissioned Ende to write a piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Friedrich Schiller's death. Ende produced a sketch in which a statue of Schiller was interviewed about newsworthy issues, and replied with quotes from Schiller's work. \"There was rapturous applause, and commissions arrived from other cabarets too.\" Michael Ende began to compose sketches, chansons and monologues.<ref name=\"ingeborg-hoffmann\"/>\n\nFor fourteen years, Ende and Hoffmann, who greatly admired [[Culture of Italy|Italian culture]], lived just outside Rome in [[Genzano di Roma|Genzano]], Italy, in a house they called Casa Liocorno (\"The Unicorn\"). It was there that Ende wrote most of the novel ''Momo''. Following the death of his wife, Ende sold the home in Genzano and returned to Munich. \n\nHe married a second time in 1989, the Japanese woman Mariko Sato, and they remained married until his death.<ref name=biografie/> He first met Mariko Sato in 1976. Sato had moved from Japan to Germany in 1974 and was working for the [[International Youth Library]] in [[Munich]]. After their meeting at the Bologna Children's Book Fair, Sato translated some of Ende's books into Japanese<ref>https://www.planet-schule.de/wissenspool/autoren-erzaehlen/inhalt/hintergrund/michael-ende.html</ref> and helped answer some of his questions about Japanese culture. From 1977 to 1980 Michael Ende and Mariko Sato worked together to produce a German translation of ten fairy tales by Japanese writer Kenji Miyazawa. The German text was never published, but the working partnership turned into a friendship. Mariko Sato accompanied him on a number of trips to Japan. The first trip took place in 1977 and included visits to Tokyo and Kyoto. For the first time Ende was able to experience Kabuki and Noh theatre, and was greatly impressed by traditional Japanese drama. Michael Ende had no children.\n\n==Death==\nIn June 1994, Ende was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Over the next few months he underwent various treatments, but the disease progressed. He ultimately succumbed to the disease in Filderstadt, Germany, on 28 August 1995.<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/illness-and-death</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\nMichael Ende's works include:\n(Note \u2013 original titles are listed in German, followed by the English translation of the title in parentheses.

He is best known for his epic fantasy ''[[The Neverending Story]]''; other famous works include ''[[Momo (novel)|Momo]]'' and ''[[Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver]]''. His works have been translated into more than 40 languages, sold more than 35 million copies,<ref>http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/autordetail-seite/michael-ende-87/</ref> and adapted as motion pictures, stage plays, operas and audio books. Ende is one of the most popular and famous German authors of the 20th century, mostly due to the enormous success of his children's fiction. He was not strictly a children's writer, however, as he wrote books for adults too.\nEnde's writing could be described as a surreal mixture of reality and fantasy.\n\n==Early life==\nEnde was born 12 November 1929 in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], [[Bavaria]], the only child of the [[surrealism|surrealist]] painter [[Edgar Ende]] and Luise Bartholom\u00e4 Ende, a physiotherapist (Coby).{{huh|date=September 2016}} In 1935, when Michael was six, the Ende family moved to the \"artists' quarter of [[Schwabing]]\" in Munich (Haase).{{huh|date=September 2016}} Growing up in this rich artistic and literary environment influenced Ende's later writing.\n\nIn 1936, his father's work was declared \"degenerate\" and banned by the Nazi party, so Edgar Ende was forced to work in secret.<ref name=biografie>{{Cite web |url=http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/michael-ende/biografie/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-09-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160702212212/http://www.thienemann-esslinger.de/thienemann/autoren-illustratoren/michael-ende/biografie/ |archive-date=2016-07-02 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The horrors of [[World War II]] heavily influenced Ende's childhood. He was twelve years old when the first air raid took place above Munich. He reflected:\n<blockquote>Our street was consumed by flames. The fire didn't crackle; it roared. The flames were roaring. I remember singing and careering through the blaze like a drunkard. I was in the grip of a kind of euphoria. I still don't truly understand it, but I was almost tempted to cast myself into the fire like a moth into the light. </blockquote>\nHe was horrified by the [[Bombing of Hamburg in World War II|1943 Hamburg bombing]], which he experienced while visiting his paternal uncle. At the first available opportunity his uncle put him on a train back to Munich. There, Ende attended the Maximillians Gymnasium in Munich until schools were closed as the air raids intensified and pupils were evacuated. Ende returned to [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]], where he was billeted in a boarding-house, Haus Kramerhof and later in Haus Roseneck. It was there that his interest in poetry was awakened. As well as writing his own poetry, he began to study poetical movements and styles. A good deal of modern poetry was banned at the time, so he studied the Romantic poet [[Novalis]], whose ''Hymns to the Night'' left a great impression on him.\n\nIn 1944, Edgar Ende's studio at no. 90 Kaulbachstra\u00dfe, Munich went up in flames. Over two hundred and fifty paintings and sketches were destroyed, as well as all his prints and etchings. {{Interlanguage link multi|Ernst Buchner (historian)|de|3=Ernst Buchner (Kunsthistoriker)|lt=Ernst Buchner}}, Director of Public Art for Bavaria, was still in possession of a number of Ende's paintings, and they survived the raids. After the bombing, Luise Ende was relocated to the Munich district of Solln. In 1945, Edgar Ende was taken prisoner by the Americans and released soon after the war.\n\nIn 1945, German youths as young as fourteen were drafted into the ''[[Volkssturm]]'' and sent to war against the advancing Allied armies. Three of Michael Ende's classmates were killed on their first day of action. Ende was also drafted, but he tore up his call-up papers and joined a Bavarian resistance movement founded to sabotage the SS's declared intention to defend Munich until the \"bitter end\". He served as a courier for the group for the remainder of the war.\n\nIn 1946, Michael Ende's grammar school re-opened, and he attended classes for a year, following which the financial support of family friends allowed him to complete his high-school education at a [[Waldorf education|Waldorf School]] in [[Stuttgart]]. This seemingly charitable gesture was motivated by more self-interest: Ende had fallen in love with a girl three years his senior, and her parents funded his two-year stay in Stuttgart to keep the pair apart. It was at this time that he first began to write stories (\"Michael,\" par. 3).{{huh|date=September 2016}} He aspired to be a \"dramatist,\" but wrote mostly short stories and poems (Haase).{{huh|date=September 2016}}\n\n==Career==\n\n===Early career===\nDuring his time in Stuttgart, Ende first encountered [[Expressionism|Expressionist]] and [[Dada]]ist writing and began schooling himself in literature. He studied [[Theodor D\u00e4ubler]], [[Yvan Goll]], [[Else Lasker-Sch\u00fcler]] and [[Alfred Mombert]], but his real love was the poetry of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]], [[Stefan George]] and [[Georg Trakl]]. He also made his first attempts at acting, performing with friends in Stuttgart's America House. He was involved in productions of [[Chekhov]]'s one-act comedy \"The Bear\", in which he played the principal role, and in the German premiere of [[Jean Cocteau]]'s \"[[Orpheus]]\". Ende's first play \"Denn die Stunde dr\u00e4ngt (As Time is Running Out)\" dates to this period. It was dedicated to [[Hiroshima]], and was never performed.\n\nEnde decided that he wanted to be a playwright, but financial considerations ruled out a university degree, so in 1948 he auditioned for the [[Otto Falckenberg School of the Performing Arts]] in Munich and was granted a two-year scholarship (Haase).\nOn leaving drama school, his first job as an actor took him to a provincial theatre company in Schleswig-Holstein. The troupe travelled from town to town by bus, usually performing on makeshift stages, surrounded by beer, smoke and the clatter of skittles from nearby bowling alleys. The acting was a disappointment, he usually had to play old men and malicious schemers, and had barely enough time to memorize his lines. Despite the frustrations and disappointments of his early acting career, Ende came to value his time in the provinces as a valuable learning experience that endowed him with a practical, down-to-earth approach to his work: \"It was a good experience, a healthy experience. Anyone interested in writing should be made to do that sort of thing. It doesn't have to be restricted to acting. It could be any kind of practical activity like cabinet making\u2014learning how to construct a cabinet in which the doors fit properly.\" In Ende's view, practical training had the potential to be more useful than a literary degree.\n\nThanks to the numerous contacts of his girlfriend [[Ingeborg Hoffmann]], Michael Ende was introduced to a variety of cabaret groups. In 1955, {{Interlanguage link multi|Therese Angeloff|de}}, head of {{Interlanguage link multi|Die kleinen Fische|de}} (the 'Little Fish' cabaret), commissioned Ende to write a piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s death. Ende produced a sketch in which a statue of Schiller was interviewed about newsworthy issues, and replied with quotes from Schiller's work. \"There was rapturous applause, and commissions arrived from other cabarets too.\" Michael Ende began to compose sketches, chansons and monologues. He also worked as a film critic during the 1950s.<ref>https://www.inhaltsangabe.de/autoren/ende/</ref>\n\n===Commercial success: writing ''Jim Knopf''===\nIn the late 1950s, Ende wrote his first novel ''Jim Button''.\n{{Quote|I sat down at my desk and wrote: \"The country in which the engine-driver, Luke, lived was called Morrowland. It was a rather small country.\" Once I'd written the two lines, I hadn't a clue how the third line might go. I didn't start out with a concept or a plan\u2014I just left myself drift from one sentence and one thought to the next. That's how I discovered that writing could be an adventure. The story carried on growing, new characters started appearing, and to my astonishment different plotlines began to weave together. The manuscript was getting longer all the time and was already much more than a picture book. I finally wrote the last sentence ten months later, and a great stack of paper had accumulated on the desk.}}\nMichael Ende always said that ideas only came to him when the logic of the story required them. On some occasions he waited a long time for inspiration to arrive.\nAt one point during the writing of ''Jim Button'' the plot reached a dead end. Jim and Luke were stuck among black rocks and their tank engine couldn't go any further. Ende was at a loss to think of a way out of the adventure, but cutting the episode struck him as disingenuous. Three weeks later he was about to shelve the novel when suddenly he had an idea\u2014the steam from the tank engine could freeze and cover the rocks in snow, thus saving his characters from their scrape. \"In my case, writing is primarily a question of patience,\" he once commented.<ref name=birth>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/a-famous-first-line-that-gave-birth-to-a-novel</ref>\n\nAfter nearly a year the five hundred pages of manuscript were complete.\nOver the next eighteen months he sent the manuscript to ten different publishers, but they all responded that it was \"Unsuitable for our list\" or \"Too long for children\". In the end he began to lose hope and toyed with the idea of throwing away the script. He eventually tried it at a small family publishing-house, K. {{Interlanguage link multi|Thienemann Verlag|de}} in Stuttgart. Michael Ende's manuscript was accepted by company director Lotte Weitbrecht who liked the story. Her only stipulation was that the manuscript had to be published as two separate books.\n\nThe first of the ''Jim Button'' novels was published in 1960. About a year later, on the morning of the announcement that his novel, ''Jim Button and Luke the Engine Driver'', had won the German Prize for Children's Fiction, Ende was being sued by his landlady for seven months' rent backpayment. With the prize money of five thousand marks, Michael Ende's financial situation improved substantially and his writing career began in earnest. After the awards ceremony, he embarked on his first reading tour, and within a year, the first ''Jim Knopf'' book was also nominated for the [[Hans Christian Andersen Award]] and received the Berlin Literary Prize for Youth Fiction.\nThe second ''Jim Knopf'' novel, ''Jim Button and the Wild Thirteen'', was published in 1962. Both books were serialized on radio and TV, and the [[Augsburger Puppenkiste]] famously adapted the novels in a version filmed by Hesse's broadcasting corporation. The print-runs sold out so rapidly that K. Thienemanns could barely keep up. Translations into numerous foreign languages soon followed.<ref name=birth/>\n\n===Writing style and themes===\nEnde claimed, \"It is for this child in me, and in all of us, that I tell my stories\", and that \"[my books are] for any child between 80 and 8 years\" (qtd. Senick 95, 97). He often expressed frustration over being perceived as a children's writer exclusively, considering that his purpose was to speak of cultural problems and spiritual wisdom to people of all ages. Especially in Germany, Ende was accused by some critics of [[escapism]].<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/escapism-censured</ref><ref>https://www.welt.de/kultur/article5174581/Michael-Endes-Buecher-waren-Opium-fuer-Kinder.html</ref> He wrote in 1985:\n\n<blockquote>One may enter the literary parlor via just about any door, be it the prison door, the madhouse door, or the brothel door. There is but one door one may not enter it through, which is the nursery door. The critics will never forgive you such. The great [[Rudyard Kipling]] is one to have suffered this. I keep wondering to myself what this peculiar contempt towards anything related to childhood is all about.<ref>\"''Man darf von jeder T\u00fcr aus in den literarischen Salon treten, aus der Gef\u00e4ngnist\u00fcr, aus der Irrenhaust\u00fcr oder aus der Bordellt\u00fcr. Nur aus einer T\u00fcr darf man nicht kommen, aus der Kinderzimmert\u00fcr. Das vergibt einem die Kritik nicht. Das bekam schon der gro\u00dfe Rudyard Kipling zu sp\u00fcren. Ich frage mich immer, womit das eigentlich zu tun hat, woher diese eigent\u00fcmliche Verachtung alles dessen herr\u00fchrt, was mit dem Kind zu tun hat.''{{-\"}} [http://www.thienemann.de/me/galerie.htm Page on Michael Ende] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119045820/http://www.thienemann.de/me/galerie.htm |date=2009-11-19 }} by Thienemann, the publishing house that published most of Ende's works.</ref></blockquote>\n\nEnde's writing could be described as a surreal mixture of reality and [[fantasy]]. The reader is often invited to take a more interactive role in the story, and the worlds in his books often mirror our reality, using fantasy to bring light to the problems of an increasingly technological modern society. His writings were influenced by [[Rudolf Steiner]] and his [[anthroposophy]].<ref>Peter Boccarius, ''Michael Ende: Der Anfang der Geschichte'', M\u00fcnchen: Nymphenburger, 1990. {{ISBN|3-485-00622-X}}. German.</ref><ref>[http://www.michaelende.com/bio.php?id=10&lang=de Michael Ende biographical notes], \"Michael Ende und die magischen Weltbilder\" (German). \"...es sei nicht nur die Steinersche Anthroposophie gewesen, die Michael Endes Weltsicht gepr\u00e4gt habe.\" (\"...it was not only Steiner's anthroposophy that defined Michael Ende's world view.\") Accessed 2008-09-08</ref> Ende was also known as a proponent of economic reform, and claimed to have had the concept of aging money, or [[Demurrage (currency)|demurrage]], in mind when writing ''Momo''. A theme of his work was the loss of fantasy and magic in the modern world.<ref>http://www.rossipotti.de/inhalt/literaturlexikon/autoren/ende_michael.html</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nMichael Ende had been fascinated by Japan since his childhood. He loved [[Lafcadio Hearn]]'s Japanese legends and ghost stories, and in 1959 he wrote a play inspired by Hearn's material. ''Die P\u00e4onienlaterne'' (The Peony Lantern) was written for radio, but never broadcast. Ende was primarily interested in Japan because of its radical otherness. The Japanese language and script were so different from Ende's native German that it seemed they were grounded in a different kind of consciousness\u2014an alternative way of seeing the world. He was particularly intrigued by the way in which everyday circumstances were shaped into intricate rituals, such as the tea ceremony. There was, he realized, a sharp contrast between the traditions of ancient Japan and its industry-oriented modern-day society.\n\nEnde won a devoted following in Japan, and by 1993 over two million copies of ''Momo'' and ''The Neverending Story'' had been sold in Japan. \n\nIn 1986 Michael Ende was invited to attend the annual congress of the JBBY (Japanese Committee for International Children's Literature) in Tokyo. He gave a lecture on \"Eternal Child-likeness\"\u2014the first detailed explanation of his artistic vision.\n1989 marked the opening of the exhibition ''Michael and Edgar Ende'' in Tokyo. The exhibition was subsequently shown in Otsu, Miyazaki, Nagasaki, Osaka, Nagoya and Fukuyama. At the invitation of ''Shimbun'', a Japanese newspaper, Michael Ende attended the opening and spent two months touring Japan. It was his third trip accompanied by the Japanese-born Mariko Sato, whom he married in September 1989. The following year an archive devoted to Michael Ende was established at Kurohime Dowakan, a museum in the Japanese city of Shinano-machi. Ende donated letters and other personal items to the collection. On 23 October 1992 Michael Ende made his final trip to Japan. In the course of their three-week visit Michael Ende and Mariko Sato-Ende visited the Dowakan museum, joined Ende's Japanese publishers, Iwanami, in celebrating the millionth sale of Momo, and travelled to Kanazawa and Hamamatsu and a number of other cities that were new to Ende.<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/mariko-sato-and-japan</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nOn New Year's Eve 1952, Michael Ende met the actress [[Ingeborg Hoffmann]] during a party with friends. According to Ende, he was standing at an ivy-covered counter serving as barman, when Hoffmann strode towards him, looking \"flame-haired, fiery and chic\". She declaimed: \"Leaning up against the ivy-covered wall / Of this old terrace\"; \"[[Eduard M\u00f6rike|M\u00f6rike]]\", Ende said instantly, recognizing the quote. Hoffmann, eight years his senior, made a big impression on Ende. She in turn was intrigued by his literary cultivation and artistic inclinations.<ref name=\"ingeborg-hoffmann\">http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/ingeborg-hoffmann</ref> They began a relationship that led to their marriage in 1964 in Rome, Italy, and ended with Ingeborg Hoffmann's sudden and unexpected death in 1985 from a [[pulmonary embolism]]; she was 63 years old.\n\nHoffmann influenced Ende profoundly. In addition to assisting with getting his first major manuscript published, Hoffmann worked with him on his others, reading them and discussing them with him. Hoffman also influenced Ende's life in other ways. She encouraged Ende to join the Humanistic Union, an organization committed to furthering humanist values. Together they campaigned for human rights, protested against rearmament, and worked towards [[peace]]. Thanks to Ingeborg Hoffmann's numerous contacts, Michael Ende was introduced to a variety of cabaret groups. In 1955, Therese Angeloff, head of Die kleinen Fische (the 'Little Fish' cabaret), commissioned Ende to write a piece in commemoration of the 150th anniversary of Friedrich Schiller's death. Ende produced a sketch in which a statue of Schiller was interviewed about newsworthy issues, and replied with quotes from Schiller's work. \"There was rapturous applause, and commissions arrived from other cabarets too.\" Michael Ende began to compose sketches, chansons and monologues.<ref name=\"ingeborg-hoffmann\"/>\n\nFor fourteen years, Ende and Hoffmann, who greatly admired [[Culture of Italy|Italian culture]], lived just outside Rome in [[Genzano di Roma|Genzano]], Italy, in a house they called Casa Liocorno (\"The Unicorn\"). It was there that Ende wrote most of the novel ''Momo''. Following the death of his wife, Ende sold the home in Genzano and returned to Munich. \n\nHe married a second time in 1989, the Japanese woman Mariko Sato, and they remained married until his death.<ref name=biografie/> He first met Mariko Sato in 1976. Sato had moved from Japan to Germany in 1974 and was working for the [[International Youth Library]] in [[Munich]]. After their meeting at the Bologna Children's Book Fair, Sato translated some of Ende's books into Japanese<ref>https://www.planet-schule.de/wissenspool/autoren-erzaehlen/inhalt/hintergrund/michael-ende.html</ref> and helped answer some of his questions about Japanese culture. From 1977 to 1980 Michael Ende and Mariko Sato worked together to produce a German translation of ten fairy tales by Japanese writer Kenji Miyazawa. The German text was never published, but the working partnership turned into a friendship. Mariko Sato accompanied him on a number of trips to Japan. The first trip took place in 1977 and included visits to Tokyo and Kyoto. For the first time Ende was able to experience Kabuki and Noh theatre, and was greatly impressed by traditional Japanese drama. Michael Ende had no children.\n\n==Death==\nIn June 1994, Ende was diagnosed with stomach cancer. Over the next few months he underwent various treatments, but the disease progressed. He ultimately succumbed to the disease in Filderstadt, Germany, on 28 August 1995.<ref>http://www.michaelende.de/en/author/biography/illness-and-death</ref>\n\n==Selected works==\nMichael Ende's works include:\n(Note \u2013 original titles are listed in German, followed by the English translation of the title in captions.
