The [[ancient Greeks]] considered the centre of the world to be in Delphi, marked by the stone monument known as [[Omphalos of Delphi|the omphalos]] (navel).\n\nIt occupies a site on the south-western slope of [[Mount Parnassus]], overlooking the coastal plain to the south and the valley of [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]]. It is now an extensive archaeological site with [[Delphi (modern town)|a small modern town of the same name]] nearby. It is recognised by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] in having had a great influence in the ancient world, as evidenced by the various monuments built there by most of the important ancient Greek city-states, demonstrating their fundamental [[Hellenic civilisation|Hellenic]] unity.\n\n==Origins and location==\n[[File:Map greek sanctuaries-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Delphi among the main Greek sanctuaries]]\nDelphi is located in upper central Greece, on multiple plateaux along the slope of [[Mount Parnassus]], and includes the Sanctuary of [[Apollo]] (the god of light, knowledge and harmony), the site of the ancient [[Oracle]]. This semicircular spur is known as [[Phaedriades]], and overlooks the Pleistos Valley.\n\nIn myths dating to [[Classical Greece|the classical period of Ancient Greece]] (510\u2013323 BC), Zeus determined the site of Delphi when he sought to find the centre of his \"Grandmother Earth\" ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]). He sent two eagles flying from the eastern and western extremities, and the path of the eagles crossed over Delphi where the [[omphalos]], or navel of Gaia was found.<ref>Graves, Robert (1993), \"The Greek Myths: Complete Edition\" (Penguin, Harmondsworth)</ref><ref name=\"Harissis 2019\">Harissis 2019</ref>\n\nEarlier myths <ref>Pausanias 10.12.1</ref><ref name=\"Harissis 2019\"/> include traditions that [[Pythia]], or the Delphic oracle, already was the site of an important oracle in the pre-classical Greek world (as early as 1400&nbsp;BC) and, rededicated from about 800&nbsp;BC, when it served as the major site during classical times for the worship of the god [[Apollo]]. Apollo was said to have slain [[Python (mythology)|Python]], a \"drako\" a serpent or a dragon who lived there and protected the [[Omphalos|navel]] of the [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]].<ref>Konstaninou, Ioanna \"Delphi: the Oracle and its Role in the Political and Social Life of the Ancient Greeks\" (Hannibal Publishing House, Athens)</ref> \"Python\" (derived from the verb \u03c0\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9 (''pyth\u014d''),<ref>\n[[LSJ]] s.v.

Pottery and bronze as well as tripod dedications continue in a steady stream, in contrast to [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Neither the range of objects nor the presence of prestigious dedications proves that Delphi was a focus of attention for a wide range of worshippers, but the large quantity of valuable goods, found in no other mainland sanctuary, encourages that view.\n\n[[Apollo]]'s sacred precinct in Delphi was a panhellenic [[sanctuary]], where every four years, starting in 586&nbsp;BC{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}} athletes from all over the Greek world competed in the [[Pythian Games]], one of the four [[Panhellenic Games]], precursors of the [[Modern Olympics]]. The victors at Delphi were presented with a laurel crown (''stephanos'') which was ceremonially cut from a tree by a boy who re-enacted the slaying of the Python.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}} (These competitions are also called stephantic games, after the crown.) Delphi was set apart from the other games sites because it hosted the mousikos agon, musical competitions.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=95}}\n\nThese Pythian Games rank second among the four stephanitic games chronologically and in importance.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}} These games, though, were different from the games at Olympia in that they were not of such vast importance to the city of Delphi as the games at Olympia were to the area surrounding Olympia. Delphi would have been a renowned city regardless of whether it hosted these games; it had other attractions that led to it being labeled the \"omphalos\" (navel) of the earth, in other words, the centre of the world.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}}{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=97}}\n\nIn the inner ''hestia'' ([[hearth]]) of the Temple of Apollo, an [[eternal flame]] burned. After the [[battle of Plataea]], the Greek cities extinguished their fires and brought new fire from the hearth of Greece, at Delphi; in the [[foundation story|foundation stories]] of several Greek colonies, the founding colonists were first dedicated at Delphi.<ref>Burkert 1985, pp. 61, 84.</ref>\n\n==Religious significance==\n[[File:Delphi Temple of Apollo.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the ancient temple of Apollo at Delphi, overlooking the valley of Phocis.]]\n\nThe name ''Delphi'' comes from the same root as \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cd\u03c2 ''delphys'', \"womb\" and may indicate archaic veneration of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] at the site.{{efn|Such was its prestige that most Hellenes after 500&nbsp;BCE placed its foundation in the earliest days of the world: before Apollo took possession, they said, Ge (Earth) (''Gaia'') and her daughter Themis had spoken oracles at Pytho. Such has been the strength of the tradition that many historians and others have accepted as historical fact the ancient statement that Ge and Themis spoke oracles before it became Apollo's establishment, yet nothing but the myth supports this statement. In the earliest account known of the Delphic oracle's beginnings, the story found in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (281\u2013374), there was no [[oracle]] before Apollo came and killed the great she-dragon, Pytho's only inhabitant.

That such conceptions attached to Gaia is shown by the records of her cults at Delphi, Athens, and Aegae. A recently discovered inscription speaks of a temple of Ge at Delphi. ...

Obverse: Short [[Sacrificial tripod|tripod]]. Reverse: Pellet within circle ([[omphalos]] or [[Patera|phiale]]).]]\n\nDelphi is perhaps best known for its oracle, the [[Pythia]], the [[sibyl]] or priestess at the sanctuary dedicated to Apollo. According to [[Aeschylus]] in the prologue of the ''[[Oresteia#The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', the oracle had origins in prehistoric times and the worship of [[Gaea (mythology)|Gaea]], a view echoed by H.W. Parke.{{efn|The foundation of Delphi and its oracle took place before the times of recorded history. It would be foolish to look for a clear statement of origin from any ancient authority, but one might hope for a plain account of the primitive traditions. Actually this is not what we find. The foundation of the oracle is described by three early writers: the author of the ''Homeric Hymn to Apollo'', [[Aeschylus]] in the prologue to the ''Eumenides'', and [[Euripides]] in a chorus in the ''Iphigeneia in Tauris''. All three versions, instead of being simple and traditional, are already selective and tendentious. They disagree with each other basically, but have been superficially combined in the conventional version of late classical times.\" Parke goes on to say, \"This version [Euripides] evidently reproduces in a sophisticated form the primitive tradition which Aeschylus for his own purposes had been at pains to contradict: the belief that Apollo came to Delphi as an invader and appropriated for himself a previously existing oracle of [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]]. The slaying of the serpent is the act of conquest which secures his possession; not as in the ''Homeric Hymn'', a merely secondary work of improvement on the site. Another difference is also noticeable. The ''Homeric Hymn'', as we saw, implied that the method of prophecy used there was similar to that of [[Dodona]]: both Aeschylus and Euripides, writing in the fifth century, attribute to primeval times the same methods as used at Delphi in their own day. So much is implied by their allusions to tripods and prophetic seats. ... [continuing on p.&nbsp;6] ... Another very archaic feature at Delphi also confirms the ancient associations of the place with the Earth goddess. This was the Omphalos, an egg-shaped stone which was situated in the innermost sanctuary of the temple in historic times. Classical legend asserted that it marked the 'navel' (Omphalos) or center of the Earth and explained that this spot was determined by [[Zeus]] who had released two eagles to fly from opposite sides of the earth and that they had met exactly over this place\". On p.7 he writes further, \"So Delphi was originally devoted to the worship of the Earth goddess whom the Greeks called Ge, or Gaia. [[Themis]], who is associated with her in tradition as her daughter and partner or successor, is really another manifestation of the same deity: an identity which Aeschylus himself recognized in another context. The worship of these two, as one or distinguished, was displaced by the introduction of Apollo. His origin has been the subject of much learned controversy: it is sufficient for our purpose to take him as the ''Homeric Hymn'' represents him \u2013 a northern intruder \u2013 and his arrival must have occurred in the dark interval between Mycenaean and Hellenic times. His conflict with Ge for the possession of the cult site was represented under the legend of his slaying the serpent.<ref>Herbert William Parke, ''The Delphic Oracle'', v. 1, p. 3.</ref>}}\n\nOne tale of the sanctuary's discovery states that a goatherd, who grazed his flocks on Parnassus, one day observed his goats playing with great agility upon nearing a chasm in the rock; the goatherd noticing this held his head over the chasm causing the fumes to go to his brain; throwing him into a strange trance.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog |title=Lives of the Necromancers |year=1876 |page=[https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog/page/n169 11] |author=William Godwin |publisher=London, F.

Alone in an enclosed inner sanctum (Ancient Greek ''adyton'' - \"do not enter\") she sat on a tripod seat over an opening in the earth (the \"chasm\"). According to legend, when Apollo slew Python its body fell into this fissure and fumes arose from its decomposing body. Intoxicated by the vapours, the sibyl would fall into a trance, allowing Apollo to possess her spirit. In this state she prophesied.

Few cities would undertake such an expedition without consulting the oracle. Thus at a moment when the growth of population might have led to congestion within the city, to random emigration, or to conflicts for arable land in the more densely populated regions, Delphi, willy-nilly, faced the problem and conducted a program of organized dispersal.<ref>[[Lewis Mumford]], ''[[The City in History]]''.

The town started to gain pan-Hellenic relevance as both a shrine and an oracle in the 7th century BC. Initially under the control of [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocaean]] settlers based in nearby [[Kirra, Phocis|Kirra]] (currently [[Itea, Phocis|Itea]]), Delphi was reclaimed by the [[Athens|Athenians]] during the [[First Sacred War]] (597\u2013585 BC). The conflict resulted in the consolidation of the [[Amphictyonic League#The Delphic Amphictyony|Amphictyonic League]], which had both a military and a religious function revolving around the protection of the [[Delphi#Temple of Apollo|Temple of Apollo]]. This shrine was destroyed by fire in 548 BC and then fell under the control of the [[Alcmaeonidae|Alcmaeonids]] banned from Athens. In 449\u2013448 BC, the [[Second Sacred War]] (fought in the wider context of the [[First Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Peloponnesian League]] led by [[Sparta]] and the [[Delian League|Delian-Attic League]] led by Athens) resulted in the [[Phocis|Phocians]] gaining control of Delphi and the management of the [[Pythian Games]].\n\nIn 356 BC the Phocians under Philomelos captured and sacked Delphi, leading to the [[Third Sacred War]] (356\u2013346 BC), which ended with the defeat of the former and the [[rise of Macedon]] under the reign of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. This led to the [[Rise of Macedon#Fourth Sacred War|Fourth Sacred War]] (339 BC), which culminated in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] (338 BC) and the establishment of Macedonian rule over Greece.\nIn Delphi, Macedonian rule was superseded by the [[Aetolians]] in 279 BC, when a [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic invasion]] was repelled, and by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] in 191 BC. The site was sacked by [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in 86 BC, during the [[Mithridatic Wars]], and by [[Nero]] in 66 AD. Although subsequent Roman emperors of the [[Flavian dynasty]] contributed towards to the restoration of the site, it gradually lost importance. In the course of the 3rd century [[mystery cults]] became more popular than the traditional [[Greek pantheon]]. Christianity, which started as yet one more mystery cult, soon gained ground, and this eventually resulted in the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]]. The anti-pagan legislation of the Flavian dynasty deprived ancient sanctuaries of their assets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} The emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] attempted to reverse this religious climate, yet his \"pagan revival\" was particularly short-lived.

It seems that one of the first buildings of the early modern era was the monastery of the [[Dormition of Mary]] or of [[Panagia]] (the Mother of God) built above the ancient [[gymnasium at Delphi]]. It must have been towards the end of the 15th or in the 16th century that a settlement started forming there, which eventually ended up forming the village of [[Kastri, Phocis|Kastri]].\n\n[[Ottoman Delphi]] gradually began to be investigated. The first Westerner to describe the remains in Delphi was [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli]] (Cyriacus of Ancona), a 15th-century merchant turned diplomat and antiquarian. He visited Delphi in March 1436 and remained there for six days. He recorded all the visible archaeological remains based on [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] for identification. He described the stadium and the theatre at that date as well as some free standing pieces of sculpture. He also recorded several inscriptions, most of which are now lost. His identifications however were not always correct: for example he described a round building he saw as the [[temple of Apollo (Delphi)|temple of Apollo]] while this was simply the base of the Argives' ex-voto. A severe earthquake in 1500 caused much damage.\n\nIn 1766 an English expedition funded by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] included the Oxford epigraphist [[Richard Chandler]], the architect [[Nicholas Revett]], and the painter [[William Pars]]. Their studies were published in 1769 under the title ''Ionian Antiquities'',<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Ionian Antiquities, London 1769</ref> followed by a collection of inscriptions,<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Inscriptiones antiquae, pleraeque nondum editae, in Asia Minore et Graecia, praesertim Athensis, collectae, Oxford, 1774</ref> and two travel books, one about Asia Minor (1775),<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Travels in Asia Minor, Oxford, 1775.</ref> and one about Greece (1776).<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Travels in Greece, Oxford, 1776.</ref> Apart from the antiquities, they also related some vivid descriptions of daily life in Kastri, such as the crude behaviour of the Turco-Albanians who guarded the mountain passes.\n\nIn 1805 [[Edward Dodwell]] visited Delphi, accompanied by the painter Simone Pomardi.<ref>''A classical and topographical tour through Greece'', London 1819</ref> [[Lord Byron]] visited in 1809, accompanied by his friend [[John Cam Hobhouse]]:\n\nYet there I've wandered by the vaulted rill;<br>\nYes! Sighed o'er Delphi's long deserted shrine, <br>\nwhere, save that feeble fountain, all is still.\n\nHe carved his name on the same column in the gymnasium as [[George Hamilton-Gordon, 4th Earl of Aberdeen|Lord Aberdeen]], later Prime Minister, who had visited a few years before. Proper excavation did not start until the late 19th century (see \"Excavations\" section) after the village had moved.\n\n==Buildings and structures==\n[[File:Santuario de Apolo Pitio.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Site plan of the Sanctuary of Apollo, Delphi.]]\n\nOccupation of the site at Delphi can be traced back to the [[Neolithic]] period with extensive occupation and use beginning in the Mycenaean period (1600\u20131100 BC). Most of the ruins that survive today date from the most intense period of activity at the site in the 6th century BC.<ref name=\"a\">[http://www.ancient-greece.org/archaeology/delphi-archaeology.html Delphi Archaeological Site], Ancient-Greece.org</ref>\n\n===Temple of Apollo===\n{{main|Temple of Apollo (Delphi)}}\nThe ruins of the [[Temple of Delphi]] visible today date from the 4th century&nbsp;BC, and are of a [[peripteral]] [[Doric order|Doric]] building. It was erected by [[Spintharus of Corinth|Spintharus]], Xenodoros, and Agathon on the remains of an earlier temple, dated to the 6th century&nbsp;BC which itself was erected on the site of a 7th-century&nbsp;BC construction attributed to the architects Trophonios and Agamedes.<ref name=\"Sakoulas\">{{cite web|last1=Sakoulas|first1=Thomas|title=Temple of Apollo at Delphi|url=http://ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-temple-of-apollo.html|website=Ancient-Greece.org|accessdate=28 November 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Amphictyonic Council===\nThe [[Amphictyonic League|Amphictyonic Council]] was a council of representatives from six Greek tribes that controlled Delphi and also the quadrennial Pythian Games. They met biannually and came from Thessaly and central Greece. Over time, the town of Delphi gained more control of itself and the council lost much of its influence.\n\n===Treasuries===\n[[File:Treasury of Athens at Delphi.jpg|thumb|upright|The reconstructed Treasury of Athens, built to commemorate their victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]].]]\nFrom the entrance of the site, continuing up the slope almost to the temple itself, are a large number of [[votive deposit|votive]] statues, and numerous so-called treasuries. These were built by many of the Greek city states to commemorate victories and to thank the oracle for her advice which was thought to have contributed to those victories. These buildings held the rich offerings made to Apollo; these were frequently a \"tithe\" or tenth of the spoils of a battle. The most impressive is the now-restored [[Athenian Treasury]], built to commemorate their victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe [[Siphnian Treasury]] was dedicated by the city of [[Siphnos]] whose citizens gave a tithe of the yield from their silver mines until the mines came to an abrupt end when the sea flooded the workings.\n\nOne of the largest of the treasuries was that of Argos. Built in the late Doric period, the Argives took great pride in establishing their place amongst the other city states. Completed in 380 BC, the treasury draws inspiration mostly from the Temple of Hera located in the Argolis, the acropolis of the city. However, recent analysis of the Archaic elements of the treasury suggest that its founding preceded this.\n\nOther identifiable treasuries are those of the [[Sicyonian Treasury|Sikyonians]], the [[Boeotian Treasury|Boeotians]] and the [[Theban Treasury (Delphi)|Thebans]].\n\n===Altar of the Chians===\nLocated in front of the Temple of Apollo, the main altar of the sanctuary was paid for and built by the people of [[Chios]]. It is dated to the 5th century BC by the inscription on its [[cornice]]. Made entirely of black marble, except for the base and cornice, the altar would have made a striking impression. It was restored in 1920.<ref name=\"ministry\">[http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21110a/e211ja01.html Delphi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050401090258/http://www.culture.gr/2/21/211/21110a/e211ja01.html |date=2005-04-01 }}, Hellenic Ministry of Culture.</ref>\n\n===Stoa of the Athenians===\n{{main|Stoa of the Athenians}}\n[[File:Delphi-2.jpg|thumb|upright|View of the Athenian Treasury; the Stoa of the Athenians on the right.]]\n\nThe [[stoa]] leads off north-east from the main sanctuary. It was built in the [[Ionic order]] and consists of seven fluted columns, unusually carved from single pieces of stone (most columns were constructed from a series of discs joined together). The inscription on the [[stylobate]] indicates that it was built by the Athenians after their naval victory over the Persians in 478&nbsp;BC, to house their war trophies. The stoa was attached to the existing Polygonal Wall.<ref>[http://www.coastal.edu/ashes2art/delphi2/sanctuary/stoa_of_athenians.html Stoa of the Athenians] at ''Ashes2Art''.</ref>\n\n===Sibyl rock===\nThe [[Sibyl rock]] is a pulpit-like outcrop of rock between the Athenian Treasury and the [[Stoa of the Athenians]] upon the sacred way which leads up to the [[Temple of Apollo (Delphi)|temple of Apollo]] in the archaeological area of Delphi. It is claimed to be where an ancient Sibyl pre-dating the Pythia of Apollo sat to deliver her prophecies.\n\n===Theatre===\n[[File:Delphi amphitheater from above dsc06297.jpg|thumb|left|The theatre at Delphi (as viewed near the top seats)]]\nThe ancient [[theatre]] at Delphi was built further up the hill from the Temple of Apollo giving spectators a view of the entire sanctuary and the valley below.<ref>Bommelaer, J.-F., Laroche, D., Guide de Delphes: Le site, Paris 1991, pp. 207-212</ref> It was originally built in the 4th&nbsp;century&nbsp;BC but was remodeled on several occasions, particularly in 160/159 B.C. at the expenses of king Eumenes II of Pergamon and in 67 A.D. on the occasion of emperor Nero's visit.<ref name=\"b\">[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-theater.html Delphi Theater] at Ancient-Greece.org.</ref>\nThe koilon (cavea) leans against the natural slope of the mountain whereas its eastern part overrides a little torrent which led the water of the fountain Cassotis right underneath the temple of Apollo. The orchestra was initially a full circle with a diameter measuring 7 meters. The rectangular scene building ended up in two arched openings, of which the foundations are preserved today. Access to the theatre was possible through the parodoi, i.e. the side corridors. On the support walls of the parodoi are engraved large numbers of [[Manumission inscriptions at Delphi|manumission inscriptions]] recording fictitious sales of the slaves to the god.\nThe koilon was divided horizontally in two zones via a corridor called diazoma. The lower zone had 27 rows of seats and the upper one only 8. Six radially arranged stairs divided the lower part of the koilon in seven tiers. The theatre could accommodate about 4,500 spectators.<ref>Bommelaer, J.-F. \u00abDas Theater\u00bb, in Maas, M. (ed), Delphi. Orakel am Nabel der Welt,Karlsruhe 1996, pp.95-105</ref>\n\nOn the occasion of Nero's visit to Greece in 67 A.D. various alterations took place. The orchestra was paved and delimited by a parapet made of stone. The proscenium was replaced by a low pedestal, the pulpitum; its fa\u00e7ade was decorated with scenes from Hercules' myth in relief. Further repairs and transformations took place in the 2nd century A.D. Pausanias mentions that these were carried out under the auspices of Herod Atticus.\nIn antiquity, the theatre was used for the vocal and musical contests which formed part of the programme of the Pythian Games in the late Hellenistic and Roman period.<ref>Mulliez, D., \u201c\u039f\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03b1\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2. \u039f\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ce\u03bd\u201d, in \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1, \u03a1.

The poet [[Pindar]] celebrated the Alcmaeonid's temple in ''Pythian'' 7.8-9 and he also provided details of the third building (''Paean'' 8. 65-75). Other details are given by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (10.5.9-13) and the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (294 ff.). The first temple was said to have been constructed out of olive branches from [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]]. The second was made by bees out of wax and wings but was miraculously carried off by a powerful wind and deposited among the [[Hyperboreans]]. The third, as described by Pindar, was created by the gods [[Hephaestus]] and [[Athena]], but its architectural details included [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]-like figures or 'Enchantresses', whose baneful songs eventually provoked the Olympian gods to bury the temple in the earth (according to Pausanias, it was destroyed by earthquake and fire). In Pindar's words, addressed to the [[Muses]]:\n\n::::Muses, what was its fashion, shown\n::::By the skill in all arts\n::::Of the hands of Hephaestus and Athena?\n::::Of bronze the walls, and of bronze\n::::Stood the pillars beneath,\n::::But of gold were six Enchantresses\n::::Who sang above the eagle.\n::::But the sons of [[Cronus]]\n::::Opened the earth with a thunderbolt\n::::And hid the holiest of all things made.\n::::\n::::Away from their children\n::::And wives, when they hung\n::::Their lives on the honey-hearted words.<ref>Pindar, ''Paean'' 8.65-75, translated by C.M.

The museum houses an impressive collection associated with ancient Delphi, including the earliest known notation of a melody, the famous [[Charioteer of Delphi]], [[Kleobis and Biton]], golden treasures discovered beneath the Sacred Way, the [[Sphinx of Naxos]], and fragments of reliefs from the Siphnian Treasury. Immediately adjacent to the exit (and overlooked by most tour guides) is the inscription that mentions the Roman proconsul [[Gallio]].\n\nEntries to the museum and to the main complex are separate and chargeable, and a reduced rate ticket gets entry to both. There is a small cafe, and a post office by the museum.\n\n==Excavations==\n{{main|Excavations at Delphi}}\nThe site had been occupied by the village of [[Kastri, Phocis|Kastri]] since medieval times. Before a systematic excavation of the site could be undertaken, the village had to be relocated but the residents resisted. The opportunity to relocate the village occurred when it was substantially damaged by an earthquake, with villagers offered a completely new village in exchange for the old site.<!-- <\u2190 Told by state licenced guide during a tour--> In 1893 the [[French School at Athens|French Archaeological School]] removed vast quantities of soil from numerous landslides to reveal both the major buildings and structures of the sanctuary of Apollo and of Athena Pronoia along with thousands of objects, inscriptions and sculptures.<ref name=\"ministry\"/>\n\nThe site is now an archaeological one, and a very popular tourist destination. It is easily accessible from Athens as a day trip, and is often combined with the [[winter sports]] facilities available on Mount Parnassus, as well as the beaches and summer sports facilities of the nearby coast of [[Phocis]].\n\nThe site is also protected as a site of extraordinary natural beauty, and the views from it are also [[protected view|protected]]: no industrial artefacts are to be seen from Delphi other than roads and traditional architecture residences (for example high voltage power lines and the like are routed so as to be invisible from the area of the sanctuary).\n\n===5th-century Delphi===\nDuring the Great Excavation were discovered architectural members from a 5th-century Christian [[basilica]], when Delphi was a bishopric. Other important Late Roman buildings are the Eastern Baths, the house with the peristyle, the [[Roman Agora (Delphi)|Roman Agora]], the large cistern usw. At the outskirts of the city there were located late Roman cemeteries.\n\nTo the southeast of the precinct of Apollo lay the so-called Southeastern Mansion, a building with a 65-meter-long fa\u00e7ade, spread over four levels, with four triclinia and private baths. Large storage jars kept the provisions, whereas other pottery vessels and luxury items were discovered in the rooms. Among the finds stands out a tiny leopard made of mother of pearl, possibly of Sassanian origin, on display in the ground floor gallery of the [[Delphi Archaeological Museum]]. The mansion dates to the beginning of the 5th century and functioned as a private house until 580, later however it was transformed into a potters' workshop.<ref>Petrides, P., 1997, \u00abDelphes dans l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9 tardive : premi\u00e8re approche topographique et c\u00e9ramologique\u00bb, BCH 121, 681-695</ref> It is only then, in the beginning of the 6th century, that the city seems to decline: its size is reduced and its trade contacts seem to be drastically diminished.

The houses were rather spacious and two large cisterns provided running water to them.<ref>Petrides, P., 2005, \u00abUn exemple d\u2019architecture civile en Gr\u00e8ce : les maisons protobyzantines de Delphes (IVe\u2013VIIe s.)\u00bb, M\u00e9langes Jean-Pierre Sodini, Travaux et M\u00e9moires 15, Paris, pp.193-204.</ref>\n\n==Depiction in art==\n[[File:Claude Lorrain 027.jpg|thumb|''View of Delphi with Sacrificial Procession'' by [[Claude Lorrain]]]]\nFrom the 16th century onward, West Europe developed an interest in Delphi. In the mid-15th century Strabo was first translated in Latin. The earliest depictions of Delphi were totally imaginary, created by the German N. Gerbel, who published in 1545 a text based on the map of Greece by N. Sofianos. The ancient sanctuary was depicted as a fortified city.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe first travelers with archaeological interests, apart from the precursor Cyriacus of Ancona, were the British [[George Wheler (clergyman and scholar)|George Wheler]] and the French [[Jacob Spon]], who visited Greece in a joint expedition in 1675\u20131676. They published their impressions separately. In Wheler's \"Journey into Greece\", published in 1682, a sketch of the region of Dephi appeared, where the settlement of Kastri and some ruins were depicted. The illustrations in Spon's publication \"Voyage d'Italie, de Dalmatie, de Gr\u00e8ce et du Levant, 1678\" are considered original and groundbreaking.\n\nTravelers continued to visit Delphi throughout the 19th century and published their books which contained diaries, sketches, views of the site as well as pictures of coins. The illustrations often reflected the spirit of romanticism, as evident by the works of Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, where, apart from the landscapes (''La Gr\u00e8ce. Vues pittoresques et topographiques'', Paris 1834) are depicted also human types (''Costumes et usages des peuples de la Gr\u00e8ce moderne dessin\u00e9s sur les lieux'', Paris 1828). The philhellene painter W. Williams has comprised the landscape of Delphi in his themes (1829). Influential personalities such as F.Ch.-H.-L. Pouqueville, W.M. Leake, Chr. Wordsworth and Lord Byron are amongst the most important visitors of Delphi.\n\n[[File:'Delphi' by Edward Lear, watercolor, 12 by 19 cm..jpg|thumb|left|''Delphi'' by [[Edward Lear]] features the [[Phaedriades]].]]\nAfter the foundation of the modern Greek state, the press became also interested in these travelers. Thus \"Ephemeris\" writes (17 March 1889):\nIn the ''Revues des Deux Mondes'' [[Paul Lefaivre]] published his memoirs from an excursion to Delphi. The French author relates in a charming style his adventures on the road, praising particularly the ability of an old woman to put back in place the dislocated arm of one of his foreign traveling companions, who had fallen off the horse. \"In [[Arachova]] the Greek type is preserved intact. The men are rather athletes than farmers, built for running and wrestling, particularly elegant and slender under their mountain gear.\" Only briefly does he refer to the antiquities of Delphi, but he refers to a pelasgian wall 80&nbsp;meters long, \"on which innumerable inscriptions are carved, decrees, conventions, manumissions.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nGradually the first travelling guides appeared. The revolutionary \"pocket\" books invented by [[Karl Baedeker]], accompanied by maps useful for visiting archaeological sites such as Delphi (1894) and the informed plans, the guides became practical and popular. The photographic lens revolutionized the way of depicting the landscape and the antiquities, particularly from 1893 onwards, when the systematic excavations of the French Archaeological School started. However, artists such as Vera Willoughby, continued to be inspired by the landscape.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nDelphic themes inspired several graphic artists. Besides the landscape, [[Pythia]]/Sibylla become an illustration subject even on Tarot cards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/tarot-of-delphi/ |title=Tarot of Delphi |website=www.aeclectic.net |accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> A famous example constitutes Michelangelo's Delphic Sibyl (1509),<ref>{{cite media |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Michelangelo_-_Delphic_Sibyl.jpg |title=Delphic Sibyl |author=Michelangelo |year=1509 |medium=painting |website=Wikimedia Commons}}</ref><ref>{{cite media |title=The Priestess of Delphi |author=John Collier |year=1891 |medium=painting}}</ref><ref>{{cite media |title=Consulting the Oracle |author=John William Waterhouse |year=1882 |medium=painting |url=http://www.jwwaterhouse.com/view.cfm?recordid=75 |website=JWWaterhouse.com}}</ref> the 19th-century German engraving Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, as well as the recent ink on paper drawing \"The Oracle of Delphi\" (2013) by M.

Examples of such works are displayed in the \"Sculpture park of the European Cultural Center of Delphi\" and in exhibitions taking place at the Archaeological Museum of Delphi.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==In literature==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nDelphi inspired literature as well. In 1814 W. Haygarth, friend of Lord Byron, refers to Delphi in his work \"Greece, a Poem\". In 1888 [[Charles Marie Ren\u00e9 Leconte de Lisle]] published his lyric drama L\u2019Apollonide, accompanied by music by [[Franz Servais]]. More recent French authors used Delphi as a source of inspiration such as [[Yves Bonnefoy]] (Delphes du second jour) or Jean Sullivan (nickname of [[Joseph Lemarchand]]) in L'Obsession de Delphes (1967), but also [[Rob MacGregor]]'s [[Indiana Jones and the Peril at Delphi]] (1991).\n\nThe presence of Delphi in Greek literature is very intense. Poets such as [[Kostis Palamas]] (The Delphic Hymn, 1894), [[Kostas Karyotakis]] (Delphic festival, 1927), [[Nikephoros Vrettakos]] (return from Delphi, 1957), [[Yannis Ritsos]] (Delphi, 1961\u201362) and [[Kiki Dimoula]] (Gas omphalos and Appropriate terrain 1988), to mention only the most renowned ones. [[Angelos Sikelianos]] wrote The Dedication (of the Delphic speech) (1927), the Delphic Hymn (1927) and the tragedy Sibylla (1940), whereas in the context of the Delphic idea and the Delphic festivals he published an essay titled \"The Delphic union\" (1930). The nobelist [[George Seferis]] wrote an essay under the title \"Delphi\", in the book \"Dokimes\".{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe importance of Delphi for the Greeks is significant. The site has been recorded on the collective memory and have been expressed through tradition. [[Nikolaos Politis]], the famous Greek ethnographer, in his Studies on the life and language of the Greek people - part A, offers two examples from Delphi:\n:a) the priest of Apollo (176)\nWhen Christ was born a priest of Apollo was sacrificing below the monastery of Panayia, on the road of Livadeia, on a site called Logari. Suddenly he abandoned the sacrifice and says to the people: \"in this moment was born the son of God, who will be very powerful, like Apollo, but then Apollo will beat him\". He didn't have time to finish his speech and a thunder came down and burnt him, opening the rock nearby into two. [p.&nbsp;99]{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n:b)The Mylords (108)\nThe Mylords are not Christians, because nobody ever saw them cross themselves. They originate from the old pagan inhabitants of Delphi who kept their property in castle called Adelphi, named after the two brother princes who built it. When Christ and his mother came to the site, and all people around converted to Christianity they thought that they should better leave; thus the Mylords left for the West and took all their belongings with them. The Mylords come here now and worship these stones.

The [[ancient Greeks]] considered the centre of the world to be in Delphi, marked by the stone monument known as [[Omphalos of Delphi|the omphalos]] (navel).\n\nIt occupies a site on the south-western slope of [[Mount Parnassus]], overlooking the coastal plain to the south and the valley of [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocis]]. It is now an extensive archaeological site with [[Delphi (modern town)|a small modern town of the same name]] nearby. It is recognised by [[UNESCO]] as a [[World Heritage Site]] in having had a great influence in the ancient world, as evidenced by the various monuments built there by most of the important ancient Greek city-states, demonstrating their fundamental [[Hellenic civilisation|Hellenic]] unity.\n\n==Origins and location==\n[[File:Map greek sanctuaries-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.75|Delphi among the main Greek sanctuaries]]\nDelphi is located in upper central Greece, on multiple plateaux along the slope of [[Mount Parnassus]], and includes the Sanctuary of [[Apollo]] (the god of light, knowledge and harmony), the site of the ancient [[Oracle]]. This semicircular spur is known as [[Phaedriades]], and overlooks the Pleistos Valley.\n\nIn myths dating to [[Classical Greece|the classical period of Ancient Greece]] (510\u2013323 BC), Zeus determined the site of Delphi when he sought to find the centre of his \"Grandmother Earth\" ([[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]]). He sent two eagles flying from the eastern and western extremities, and the path of the eagles crossed over Delphi where the [[omphalos]], or navel of Gaia was found.<ref>Graves, Robert (1993), \"The Greek Myths: Complete Edition\" (Penguin, Harmondsworth)</ref><ref name=\"Harissis 2019\">Harissis 2019</ref>\n\nEarlier myths <ref>Pausanias 10.12.1</ref><ref name=\"Harissis 2019\"/> include traditions that [[Pythia]], or the Delphic oracle, already was the site of an important oracle in the pre-classical Greek world (as early as 1400&nbsp;BC) and, rededicated from about 800&nbsp;BC, when it served as the major site during classical times for the worship of the god [[Apollo]]. Apollo was said to have slain [[Python (mythology)|Python]], a \"drako\" a serpent or a dragon who lived there and protected the [[Omphalos|navel]] of the [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]].<ref>Konstaninou, Ioanna \"Delphi: the Oracle and its Role in the Political and Social Life of the Ancient Greeks\" (Hannibal Publishing House, Athens)</ref> \"Python\" (derived from the verb \u03c0\u03cd\u03b8\u03c9 (''pyth\u014d''),<ref>\n[[LSJ] s.v.

Pottery and bronze as well as tripod dedications continue in a steady stream, in contrast to [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]]. Neither the range of objects nor the presence of prestigious dedications proves that Delphi was a focus of attention for a wide range of worshippers, but the large quantity of valuable goods, found in no other mainland sanctuary, encourages that view.\n\n[[Apollo]]'s sacred precinct in Delphi was a panhellenic [[sanctuary]], where every four years, starting in 586&nbsp;BC{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}} athletes from all over the Greek world competed in the [[Pythian Games]], one of the four [[Panhellenic Games]], precursors of the [[Modern Olympics]]. The victors at Delphi were presented with a laurel crown (''stephanos'') which was ceremonially cut from a tree by a boy who re-enacted the slaying of the Python.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}} (These competitions are also called stephantic games, after the crown.) Delphi was set apart from the other games sites because it hosted the mousikos agon, musical competitions.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=95}}\n\nThese Pythian Games rank second among the four stephanitic games chronologically and in importance.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}} These games, though, were different from the games at Olympia in that they were not of such vast importance to the city of Delphi as the games at Olympia were to the area surrounding Olympia. Delphi would have been a renowned city regardless of whether it hosted these games; it had other attractions that led to it being labeled the \"omphalos\" (navel) of the earth, in other words, the centre of the world.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=96}}{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=97}}\n\nIn the inner ''hestia'' ([[hearth]]) of the Temple of Apollo, an [[eternal flame]] burned. After the [[battle of Plataea]], the Greek cities extinguished their fires and brought new fire from the hearth of Greece, at Delphi; in the [[foundation story|foundation stories]] of several Greek colonies, the founding colonists were first dedicated at Delphi.<ref>Burkert 1985, pp. 61, 84.</ref>\n\n==Religious significance==\n[[File:Delphi Temple of Apollo.jpg|thumb|Ruins of the ancient temple of Apollo at Delphi, overlooking the valley of Phocis.]]\n\nThe name ''Delphi'' comes from the same root as \u03b4\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03cd\u03c2 ''delphys'', \"womb\" and may indicate archaic veneration of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] at the site.{{efn|Such was its prestige that most Hellenes after 500&nbsp;BCE placed its foundation in the earliest days of the world: before Apollo took possession, they said, Ge (Earth) (''Gaia'') and her daughter Themis had spoken oracles at Pytho. Such has been the strength of the tradition that many historians and others have accepted as historical fact the ancient statement that Ge and Themis spoke oracles before it became Apollo's establishment, yet nothing but the myth supports this statement. In the earliest account known of the Delphic oracle's beginnings, the story found in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (281\u2013374), there was no [[oracle]] before Apollo came and killed the great she-dragon, Pytho's only inhabitant. This was apparently the Delphic myth of the sixth century.<ref>Fontenrose, Joseph (1978). ''The Delphic Oracle: Its Responses and Operations, with a Catalogue of Responses'', pp. 3\u20134.</ref>}}{{efn|The earth is the abode of the dead, therefore the earth-deity has power over the ghostly world: the shapes of [[dream]]s, which often foreshadowed the future, were supposed to ascend from the world below, therefore the earth-deity might acquire an oracular function, especially through the process of incubation, in which the consultant slept in a holy shrine with his ear upon the ground. That such conceptions attached to Gaia is shown by the records of her cults at Delphi, Athens, and Aegae. A recently discovered inscription speaks of a temple of Ge at Delphi. ... As regards Gaia, we also can accept it. It is confirmed by certain features in the latter Delphic divination, and also by the story of the Python.<ref>Farnell, Lewis Richard, ''The Cults of the Greek States'', v. III, pp. 8\u201310, onwards.</ref>}} Apollo is connected with the site by his [[epithet]] \u0394\u03b5\u03bb\u03c6\u03af\u03bd\u03b9\u03bf\u03c2 ''Delphinios'', \"the Delphinian\".

The [[Homer]]ic name of the oracle is ''Pytho'' (\u03a0\u03c5\u03b8\u03ce).<ref>[[Odyssey]], VIII, 80</ref> Another legend held that Apollo walked to Delphi from the north and stopped at [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]], a city in [[Thessaly]], to pick laurel (also known as [[Bay laurel|bay tree]]) which he considered to be a sacred plant. In commemoration of this legend, the winners at the Pythian Games received a wreath of laurel picked in the temple.\n\nDelphi became the site of a major temple to [[Apollo|Phoebus Apollo]], as well as the Pythian Games and the prehistoric oracle.

To atone the murder of Gaia's son, Apollo was forced to fly and spend eight years in menial service before he could return forgiven.

Obverse: Short [[Sacrificial tripod|tripod]]. Reverse: Pellet within circle ([[omphalos]] or [[Patera|phiale]]).]]\n\nDelphi is perhaps best known for its oracle, the [[Pythia]], the [[sibyl]] or priestess at the sanctuary dedicated to Apollo. According to [[Aeschylus]] in the prologue of the ''[[Oresteia#The Eumenides|Eumenides]]'', the oracle had origins in prehistoric times and the worship of [[Gaea (mythology)|Gaea]], a view echoed by H.W. Parke.{{efn|The foundation of Delphi and its oracle took place before the times of recorded history. It would be foolish to look for a clear statement of origin from any ancient authority, but one might hope for a plain account of the primitive traditions. Actually this is not what we find. The foundation of the oracle is described by three early writers: the author of the ''Homeric Hymn to Apollo'', [[Aeschylus]] in the prologue to the ''Eumenides'', and [[Euripides]] in a chorus in the ''Iphigeneia in Tauris''. All three versions, instead of being simple and traditional, are already selective and tendentious. They disagree with each other basically, but have been superficially combined in the conventional version of late classical times.\" Parke goes on to say, \"This version [Euripides] evidently reproduces in a sophisticated form the primitive tradition which Aeschylus for his own purposes had been at pains to contradict: the belief that Apollo came to Delphi as an invader and appropriated for himself a previously existing oracle of [[Gaia (mythology)|Earth]]. The slaying of the serpent is the act of conquest which secures his possession; not as in the ''Homeric Hymn'', a merely secondary work of improvement on the site. Another difference is also noticeable. The ''Homeric Hymn'', as we saw, implied that the method of prophecy used there was similar to that of [[Dodona]]: both Aeschylus and Euripides, writing in the fifth century, attribute to primeval times the same methods as used at Delphi in their own day. So much is implied by their allusions to tripods and prophetic seats. ... [continuing on p.&nbsp;6] ... Another very archaic feature at Delphi also confirms the ancient associations of the place with the Earth goddess. This was the Omphalos, an egg-shaped stone which was situated in the innermost sanctuary of the temple in historic times. Classical legend asserted that it marked the 'navel' (Omphalos) or center of the Earth and explained that this spot was determined by [[Zeus]] who had released two eagles to fly from opposite sides of the earth and that they had met exactly over this place\". On p.7 he writes further, \"So Delphi was originally devoted to the worship of the Earth goddess whom the Greeks called Ge, or Gaia. [[Themis]], who is associated with her in tradition as her daughter and partner or successor, is really another manifestation of the same deity: an identity which Aeschylus himself recognized in another context. The worship of these two, as one or distinguished, was displaced by the introduction of Apollo. His origin has been the subject of much learned controversy: it is sufficient for our purpose to take him as the ''Homeric Hymn'' represents him \u2013 a northern intruder \u2013 and his arrival must have occurred in the dark interval between Mycenaean and Hellenic times. His conflict with Ge for the possession of the cult site was represented under the legend of his slaying the serpent.<ref>Herbert William Parke, ''The Delphic Oracle'', v. 1, p. 3.</ref>}}\n\nOne tale of the sanctuary's discovery states that a goatherd, who grazed his flocks on Parnassus, one day observed his goats playing with great agility upon nearing a chasm in the rock; the goatherd noticing this held his head over the chasm causing the fumes to go to his brain; throwing him into a strange trance.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog |title=Lives of the Necromancers |year=1876 |page=[https://archive.org/details/livesnecromance04godwgoog/page/n169 11] |author=William Godwin |publisher=London, F.

Alone in an enclosed inner sanctum (Ancient Greek ''adyton'' - \"do not enter\") she sat on a tripod seat over an opening in the earth (the \"chasm\"). According to legend, when Apollo slew Python its body fell into this fissure and fumes arose from its decomposing body. Intoxicated by the vapours, the sibyl would fall into a trance, allowing Apollo to possess her spirit. In this state she prophesied.

Few cities would undertake such an expedition without consulting the oracle. Thus at a moment when the growth of population might have led to congestion within the city, to random emigration, or to conflicts for arable land in the more densely populated regions, Delphi, willy-nilly, faced the problem and conducted a program of organized dispersal.<ref>[[Lewis Mumford]], ''[[The City in History]]''.

The town started to gain pan-Hellenic relevance as both a shrine and an oracle in the 7th century BC. Initially under the control of [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocaean]] settlers based in nearby [[Kirra, Phocis|Kirra]] (currently [[Itea, Phocis|Itea]]), Delphi was reclaimed by the [[Athens|Athenians]] during the [[First Sacred War]] (597\u2013585 BC). The conflict resulted in the consolidation of the [[Amphictyonic League#The Delphic Amphictyony|Amphictyonic League]], which had both a military and a religious function revolving around the protection of the [[Delphi#Temple of Apollo|Temple of Apollo]]. This shrine was destroyed by fire in 548 BC and then fell under the control of the [[Alcmaeonidae|Alcmaeonids]] banned from Athens. In 449\u2013448 BC, the [[Second Sacred War]] (fought in the wider context of the [[First Peloponnesian War]] between the [[Peloponnesian League]] led by [[Sparta]] and the [[Delian League|Delian-Attic League]] led by Athens) resulted in the [[Phocis|Phocians]] gaining control of Delphi and the management of the [[Pythian Games]].\n\nIn 356 BC the Phocians under Philomelos captured and sacked Delphi, leading to the [[Third Sacred War]] (356\u2013346 BC), which ended with the defeat of the former and the [[rise of Macedon]] under the reign of [[Philip II of Macedon|Philip II]]. This led to the [[Rise of Macedon#Fourth Sacred War|Fourth Sacred War]] (339 BC), which culminated in the [[Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC)|Battle of Chaeronea]] (338 BC) and the establishment of Macedonian rule over Greece.\nIn Delphi, Macedonian rule was superseded by the [[Aetolians]] in 279 BC, when a [[Gallic invasion of the Balkans|Gallic invasion]] was repelled, and by the [[Roman Republic|Romans]] in 191 BC. The site was sacked by [[Sulla|Lucius Cornelius Sulla]] in 86 BC, during the [[Mithridatic Wars]], and by [[Nero]] in 66 AD. Although subsequent Roman emperors of the [[Flavian dynasty]] contributed towards to the restoration of the site, it gradually lost importance. In the course of the 3rd century [[mystery cults]] became more popular than the traditional [[Greek pantheon]]. Christianity, which started as yet one more mystery cult, soon gained ground, and this eventually resulted in the [[persecution of pagans in the late Roman Empire]]. The anti-pagan legislation of the Flavian dynasty deprived ancient sanctuaries of their assets.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} The emperor [[Julian (emperor)|Julian]] attempted to reverse this religious climate, yet his \"pagan revival\" was particularly short-lived. When the doctor [[Oreibasius]] visited the oracle of Delphi, in order to question the fate of paganism,he received a pessimistic answer:\n\n{{lang|grc|\u0395\u1f34\u03c0\u03b1\u03c4\u03b5 \u03c4\u1ff7 \u03b2\u03b1\u03c3\u03b9\u03bb\u03b5\u1fd6, \u03c7\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u03ad\u03c3\u03b5 \u03b4\u03b1\u03af\u03b4\u03b1\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 \u03b1\u1f50\u03bb\u03ac,\n\n\u03bf\u1f50\u03ba\u03ad\u03c4\u03b9 \u03a6\u03bf\u1fd6\u03b2\u03bf\u03c2 \u1f14\u03c7\u03b5\u03b9 \u03ba\u03b1\u03bb\u03cd\u03b2\u03b7\u03bd, \u03bf\u1f50 \u03bc\u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b9\u03b4\u03b1 \u03b4\u03ac\u03c6\u03bd\u03b7\u03bd,\n\n\u03bf\u1f50 \u03c0\u03b1\u03b3\u1f70\u03bd \u03bb\u03b1\u03bb\u03ad\u03bf\u03c5\u03c3\u03b1\u03bd, \u1f00\u03c0\u03ad\u03c3\u03b2\u03b5\u03c4\u03bf \u03ba\u03b1\u1f76 \u03bb\u03ac\u03bb\u03bf\u03bd \u1f55\u03b4\u03c9\u03c1.}}\n\n[Tell the king that the flute has fallen to the ground.

Delphi itself remained almost uninhabited for centuries. It seems that one of the first buildings of the early modern era was the monastery of the [[Dormition of Mary]] or of [[Panagia]] (the Mother of God) built above the ancient [[gymnasium at Delphi]]. It must have been towards the end of the 15th or in the 16th century that a settlement started forming there, which eventually ended up forming the village of [[Kastri, Phocis|Kastri]].\n\n[[Ottoman Delphi]] gradually began to be investigated. The first Westerner to describe the remains in Delphi was [[Ciriaco de' Pizzicolli]] (Cyriacus of Ancona), a 15th-century merchant turned diplomat and antiquarian. He visited Delphi in March 1436 and remained there for six days. He recorded all the visible archaeological remains based on [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] for identification. He described the stadium and the theatre at that date as well as some free standing pieces of sculpture. He also recorded several inscriptions, most of which are now lost. His identifications however were not always correct: for example he described a round building he saw as the [[temple of Apollo (Delphi)|temple of Apollo]] while this was simply the base of the Argives' ex-voto. A severe earthquake in 1500 caused much damage.\n\nIn 1766 an English expedition funded by the [[Society of Dilettanti]] included the Oxford epigraphist [[Richard Chandler]], the architect [[Nicholas Revett]], and the painter [[William Pars]]. Their studies were published in 1769 under the title ''Ionian Antiquities'',<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Ionian Antiquities, London 1769</ref> followed by a collection of inscriptions,<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Inscriptiones antiquae, pleraeque nondum editae, in Asia Minore et Graecia, praesertim Athensis, collectae, Oxford, 1774</ref> and two travel books, one about Asia Minor (1775),<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Travels in Asia Minor, Oxford, 1775.</ref> and one about Greece (1776).<ref>Chandler, R, Revett, N., Pars, W., Travels in Greece, Oxford, 1776.</ref> Apart from the antiquities, they also related some vivid descriptions of daily life in Kastri, such as the crude behaviour of the Turco-Albanians who guarded the mountain passes.\n\nIn 1805 [[Edward Dodwell]] visited Delphi, accompanied by the painter Simone Pomardi.<ref>''A classical and topographical tour through Greece'', London 1819</ref> [[Lord Byron]] visited in 1809, accompanied by his friend [[John Cam Hobhouse]]:\n\nYet there I've wandered by the vaulted rill;<br>\nYes!

These were built by many of the Greek city states to commemorate victories and to thank the oracle for her advice which was thought to have contributed to those victories. These buildings held the rich offerings made to Apollo; these were frequently a \"tithe\" or tenth of the spoils of a battle. The most impressive is the now-restored [[Athenian Treasury]], built to commemorate their victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490&nbsp;BC.\n\nThe [[Siphnian Treasury]] was dedicated by the city of [[Siphnos]] whose citizens gave a tithe of the yield from their silver mines until the mines came to an abrupt end when the sea flooded the workings.\n\nOne of the largest of the treasuries was that of Argos. Built in the late Doric period, the Argives took great pride in establishing their place amongst the other city states. Completed in 380 BC, the treasury draws inspiration mostly from the Temple of Hera located in the Argolis, the acropolis of the city. However, recent analysis of the Archaic elements of the treasury suggest that its founding preceded this.\n\nOther identifiable treasuries are those of the [[Sicyonian Treasury|Sikyonians]], the [[Boeotian Treasury|Boeotians]] and the [[Theban Treasury (Delphi)|Thebans]].\n\n===Altar of the Chians===\nLocated in front of the Temple of Apollo, the main altar of the sanctuary was paid for and built by the people of [[Chios]].

The orchestra was initially a full circle with a diameter measuring 7 meters. The rectangular scene building ended up in two arched openings, of which the foundations are preserved today. Access to the theatre was possible through the parodoi, i.e. the side corridors. On the support walls of the parodoi are engraved large numbers of [[Manumission inscriptions at Delphi|manumission inscriptions]] recording fictitious sales of the slaves to the god.\nThe koilon was divided horizontally in two zones via a corridor called diazoma. The lower zone had 27 rows of seats and the upper one only 8. Six radially arranged stairs divided the lower part of the koilon in seven tiers. The theatre could accommodate about 4,500 spectators.<ref>Bommelaer, J.-F. \u00abDas Theater\u00bb, in Maas, M. (ed), Delphi. Orakel am Nabel der Welt,Karlsruhe 1996, pp.95-105</ref>\n\nOn the occasion of Nero's visit to Greece in 67 A.D. various alterations took place. The orchestra was paved and delimited by a parapet made of stone. The proscenium was replaced by a low pedestal, the pulpitum; its fa\u00e7ade was decorated with scenes from Hercules' myth in relief. Further repairs and transformations took place in the 2nd century A.D. Pausanias mentions that these were carried out under the auspices of Herod Atticus.\nIn antiquity, the theatre was used for the vocal and musical contests which formed part of the programme of the Pythian Games in the late Hellenistic and Roman period.<ref>Mulliez, D., \u201c\u039f\u03b9 \u03c0\u03c5\u03b8\u03b9\u03ba\u03bf\u03af \u03b1\u03b3\u03ce\u03bd\u03b5\u03c2. \u039f\u03b9 \u03bc\u03b1\u03c1\u03c4\u03c5\u03c1\u03af\u03b5\u03c2 \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u03b5\u03c0\u03b9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03ce\u03bd\u201d, in \u039a\u03bf\u03bb\u03ce\u03bd\u03b9\u03b1, \u03a1.

It was originally built in the 5th century&nbsp;BC but was altered in later centuries. The last major remodelling took place in the 2nd century&nbsp;AD under the patronage of [[Herodes Atticus]] when the stone seating was built and (arched) entrance. It could seat 6500 spectators and the track was 177&nbsp;metres long and 25.5&nbsp;metres wide.<ref name=\"d\">[http://www.ancient-greece.org/architecture/delphi-stadium.html Delphi Stadium] at Ancient-Greece.org.</ref>\n\n===Hippodrome===\nIt was at the Pythian games that prominent political leaders, such as [[Cleisthenes of Sicyon|Cleisthenes]], tyrant of [[Sikyon]], and [[Hiero I of Syracuse|Hieron]], tyrant of [[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]], competed with their chariots.

Its name is taken from the [[polygon]]al masonry of which it is constructed. At a later date, from 200&nbsp;BC onwards, the stones were inscribed with the [[manumission]] contracts of slaves who were consecrated to Apollo. Approximately a thousand manumissions are recorded on the wall.<ref>[http://www.coastal.edu/ashes2art/delphi2/sanctuary/manumission_wall.html Manumission Wall] at ''Ashes2Art''; [http://www.attalus.org/docs/other/inscr_24.html Manumission of female slaves at Delphi] at ''attalus.org''.</ref>\n\n===Castalian spring===\n{{Main|Castalian Spring}}\nThe sacred spring of Delphi lies in the ravine of the Phaedriades. The preserved remains of two monumental fountains that received the water from the spring date to the [[Archaic period in Greece|Archaic]] period and the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], with the latter cut into the rock.\n\n===Athletic statues===\nDelphi is famous for its many preserved athletic statues. It is known that Olympia originally housed far more of these statues, but time brought ruin to many of them, leaving Delphi as the main site of athletic statues.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=98}} [[Kleobis and Biton]], two brothers renowned for their strength, are modeled in two of the earliest known athletic statues at Delphi. The statues commemorate their feat of pulling their mother's cart several miles to the Sanctuary of Hera in the absence of oxen. The neighbors were most impressed and their mother asked Hera to grant them the greatest gift. When they entered Hera's temple, they fell into a slumber and never woke, dying at the height of their admiration, the perfect gift.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=98}}\n\nThe [[Charioteer of Delphi]] is another ancient relic that has withstood the centuries. It is one of the best known statues from antiquity. The charioteer has lost many features, including his chariot and his left arm, but he stands as a tribute to athletic art of antiquity.{{sfn|Miller|2004|p=98}}\n[[Image:AurigaDelfi.jpg|thumb|upright|The ''Charioteer of Delphi'', 478 or 474 BC, Delphi Museum.]]\n\n==Architectural traditions==\nAncient tradition accounted for four temples that successively occupied the site before the 548/7&nbsp;BC fire, following which the Alcmaeonids built a fifth. The poet [[Pindar]] celebrated the Alcmaeonid's temple in ''Pythian'' 7.8-9 and he also provided details of the third building (''Paean'' 8. 65-75). Other details are given by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (10.5.9-13) and the Homeric Hymn to Apollo (294 ff.). The first temple was said to have been constructed out of olive branches from [[Vale of Tempe|Tempe]]. The second was made by bees out of wax and wings but was miraculously carried off by a powerful wind and deposited among the [[Hyperboreans]]. The third, as described by Pindar, was created by the gods [[Hephaestus]] and [[Athena]], but its architectural details included [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]-like figures or 'Enchantresses', whose baneful songs eventually provoked the Olympian gods to bury the temple in the earth (according to Pausanias, it was destroyed by earthquake and fire). In Pindar's words, addressed to the [[Muses]]:\n\n::::Muses, what was its fashion, shown\n::::By the skill in all arts\n::::Of the hands of Hephaestus and Athena?\n::::Of bronze the walls, and of bronze\n::::Stood the pillars beneath,\n::::But of gold were six Enchantresses\n::::Who sang above the eagle.\n::::But the sons of [[Cronus]]\n::::Opened the earth with a thunderbolt\n::::And hid the holiest of all things made.\n::::\n::::Away from their children\n::::And wives, when they hung\n::::Their lives on the honey-hearted words.<ref>Pindar, ''Paean'' 8.65-75, translated by C.M.

The museum houses an impressive collection associated with ancient Delphi, including the earliest known notation of a melody, the famous [[Charioteer of Delphi]], [[Kleobis and Biton]], golden treasures discovered beneath the Sacred Way, the [[Sphinx of Naxos]], and fragments of reliefs from the Siphnian Treasury. Immediately adjacent to the exit (and overlooked by most tour guides) is the inscription that mentions the Roman proconsul [[Gallio]].\n\nEntries to the museum and to the main complex are separate and chargeable, and a reduced rate ticket gets entry to both. There is a small cafe, and a post office by the museum.\n\n==Excavations==\n{{main|Excavations at Delphi}}\nThe site had been occupied by the village of [[Kastri, Phocis|Kastri]] since medieval times. Before a systematic excavation of the site could be undertaken, the village had to be relocated but the residents resisted. The opportunity to relocate the village occurred when it was substantially damaged by an earthquake, with villagers offered a completely new village in exchange for the old site.<!-- <\u2190 Told by state licenced guide during a tour--> In 1893 the [[French School at Athens|French Archaeological School]] removed vast quantities of soil from numerous landslides to reveal both the major buildings and structures of the sanctuary of Apollo and of Athena Pronoia along with thousands of objects, inscriptions and sculptures.<ref name=\"ministry\"/>\n\nThe site is now an archaeological one, and a very popular tourist destination. It is easily accessible from Athens as a day trip, and is often combined with the [[winter sports]] facilities available on Mount Parnassus, as well as the beaches and summer sports facilities of the nearby coast of [[Phocis]].\n\nThe site is also protected as a site of extraordinary natural beauty, and the views from it are also [[protected view|protected]]: no industrial artefacts are to be seen from Delphi other than roads and traditional architecture residences (for example high voltage power lines and the like are routed so as to be invisible from the area of the sanctuary).\n\n===5th-century Delphi===\nDuring the Great Excavation were discovered architectural members from a 5th-century Christian [[basilica]], when Delphi was a bishopric. Other important Late Roman buildings are the Eastern Baths, the house with the peristyle, the [[Roman Agora (Delphi)|Roman Agora]], the large cistern usw. At the outskirts of the city there were located late Roman cemeteries.\n\nTo the southeast of the precinct of Apollo lay the so-called Southeastern Mansion, a building with a 65-meter-long fa\u00e7ade, spread over four levels, with four triclinia and private baths. Large storage jars kept the provisions, whereas other pottery vessels and luxury items were discovered in the rooms. Among the finds stands out a tiny leopard made of mother of pearl, possibly of Sassanian origin, on display in the ground floor gallery of the [[Delphi Archaeological Museum]]. The mansion dates to the beginning of the 5th century and functioned as a private house until 580, later however it was transformed into a potters' workshop.<ref>Petrides, P., 1997, \u00abDelphes dans l\u2019Antiquit\u00e9 tardive : premi\u00e8re approche topographique et c\u00e9ramologique\u00bb, BCH 121, 681-695</ref> It is only then, in the beginning of the 6th century, that the city seems to decline: its size is reduced and its trade contacts seem to be drastically diminished.

The houses were rather spacious and two large cisterns provided running water to them.<ref>Petrides, P., 2005, \u00abUn exemple d\u2019architecture civile en Gr\u00e8ce : les maisons protobyzantines de Delphes (IVe\u2013VIIe s.)\u00bb, M\u00e9langes Jean-Pierre Sodini, Travaux et M\u00e9moires 15, Paris, pp.193-204.</ref>\n\n==Depiction in art==\n[[File:Claude Lorrain 027.jpg|thumb|''View of Delphi with Sacrificial Procession'' by [[Claude Lorrain]]]]\nFrom the 16th century onward, West Europe developed an interest in Delphi. In the mid-15th century Strabo was first translated in Latin. The earliest depictions of Delphi were totally imaginary, created by the German N. Gerbel, who published in 1545 a text based on the map of Greece by N. Sofianos. The ancient sanctuary was depicted as a fortified city.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe first travelers with archaeological interests, apart from the precursor Cyriacus of Ancona, were the British [[George Wheler (clergyman and scholar)|George Wheler]] and the French [[Jacob Spon]], who visited Greece in a joint expedition in 1675\u20131676. They published their impressions separately. In Wheler's \"Journey into Greece\", published in 1682, a sketch of the region of Dephi appeared, where the settlement of Kastri and some ruins were depicted. The illustrations in Spon's publication \"Voyage d'Italie, de Dalmatie, de Gr\u00e8ce et du Levant, 1678\" are considered original and groundbreaking.\n\nTravelers continued to visit Delphi throughout the 19th century and published their books which contained diaries, sketches, views of the site as well as pictures of coins. The illustrations often reflected the spirit of romanticism, as evident by the works of Otto Magnus von Stackelberg, where, apart from the landscapes (''La Gr\u00e8ce. Vues pittoresques et topographiques'', Paris 1834) are depicted also human types (''Costumes et usages des peuples de la Gr\u00e8ce moderne dessin\u00e9s sur les lieux'', Paris 1828). The philhellene painter W. Williams has comprised the landscape of Delphi in his themes (1829). Influential personalities such as F.Ch.-H.-L. Pouqueville, W.M. Leake, Chr. Wordsworth and Lord Byron are amongst the most important visitors of Delphi.\n\n[[File:'Delphi' by Edward Lear, watercolor, 12 by 19 cm..jpg|thumb|left|''Delphi'' by [[Edward Lear]] features the [[Phaedriades]].]]\nAfter the foundation of the modern Greek state, the press became also interested in these travelers. Thus \"Ephemeris\" writes (17 March 1889):\nIn the ''Revues des Deux Mondes'' [[Paul Lefaivre]] published his memoirs from an excursion to Delphi. The French author relates in a charming style his adventures on the road, praising particularly the ability of an old woman to put back in place the dislocated arm of one of his foreign traveling companions, who had fallen off the horse. \"In [[Arachova]] the Greek type is preserved intact. The men are rather athletes than farmers, built for running and wrestling, particularly elegant and slender under their mountain gear.\" Only briefly does he refer to the antiquities of Delphi, but he refers to a pelasgian wall 80&nbsp;meters long, \"on which innumerable inscriptions are carved, decrees, conventions, manumissions.\"{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nGradually the first travelling guides appeared. The revolutionary \"pocket\" books invented by [[Karl Baedeker]], accompanied by maps useful for visiting archaeological sites such as Delphi (1894) and the informed plans, the guides became practical and popular. The photographic lens revolutionized the way of depicting the landscape and the antiquities, particularly from 1893 onwards, when the systematic excavations of the French Archaeological School started. However, artists such as Vera Willoughby, continued to be inspired by the landscape.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nDelphic themes inspired several graphic artists. Besides the landscape, [[Pythia]]/Sibylla become an illustration subject even on Tarot cards.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.aeclectic.net/tarot/cards/tarot-of-delphi/ |title=Tarot of Delphi |website=www.aeclectic.net |accessdate=14 April 2018}}</ref> A famous example constitutes Michelangelo's Delphic Sibyl (1509),<ref>{{cite media |url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Michelangelo_-_Delphic_Sibyl.jpg |title=Delphic Sibyl |author=Michelangelo |year=1509 |medium=painting |website=Wikimedia Commons}}</ref><ref>{{cite media |title=The Priestess of Delphi |author=John Collier |year=1891 |medium=painting}}</ref><ref>{{cite media |title=Consulting the Oracle |author=John William Waterhouse |year=1882 |medium=painting |url=http://www.jwwaterhouse.com/view.cfm?recordid=75 |website=JWWaterhouse.com}}</ref> the 19th-century German engraving Oracle of Apollo at Delphi, as well as the recent ink on paper drawing \"The Oracle of Delphi\" (2013) by M.

Examples of such works are displayed in the \"Sculpture park of the European Cultural Center of Delphi\" and in exhibitions taking place at the Archaeological Museum of Delphi.{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\n==In literature==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nDelphi inspired literature as well. In 1814 W. Haygarth, friend of Lord Byron, refers to Delphi in his work \"Greece, a Poem\". In 1888 [[Charles Marie Ren\u00e9 Leconte de Lisle]] published his lyric drama L\u2019Apollonide, accompanied by music by [[Franz Servais]]. More recent French authors used Delphi as a source of inspiration such as [[Yves Bonnefoy]] (Delphes du second jour) or Jean Sullivan (nickname of [[Joseph Lemarchand]]) in L'Obsession de Delphes (1967), but also [[Rob MacGregor]]'s [[Indiana Jones and the Peril at Delphi]] (1991).\n\nThe presence of Delphi in Greek literature is very intense. Poets such as [[Kostis Palamas]] (The Delphic Hymn, 1894), [[Kostas Karyotakis]] (Delphic festival, 1927), [[Nikephoros Vrettakos]] (return from Delphi, 1957), [[Yannis Ritsos]] (Delphi, 1961\u201362) and [[Kiki Dimoula]] (Gas omphalos and Appropriate terrain 1988), to mention only the most renowned ones. [[Angelos Sikelianos]] wrote The Dedication (of the Delphic speech) (1927), the Delphic Hymn (1927) and the tragedy Sibylla (1940), whereas in the context of the Delphic idea and the Delphic festivals he published an essay titled \"The Delphic union\" (1930). The nobelist [[George Seferis]] wrote an essay under the title \"Delphi\", in the book \"Dokimes\".{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n\nThe importance of Delphi for the Greeks is significant. The site has been recorded on the collective memory and have been expressed through tradition. [[Nikolaos Politis]], the famous Greek ethnographer, in his Studies on the life and language of the Greek people - part A, offers two examples from Delphi:\n:a) the priest of Apollo (176)\nWhen Christ was born a priest of Apollo was sacrificing below the monastery of Panayia, on the road of Livadeia, on a site called Logari. Suddenly he abandoned the sacrifice and says to the people: \"in this moment was born the son of God, who will be very powerful, like Apollo, but then Apollo will beat him\". He didn't have time to finish his speech and a thunder came down and burnt him, opening the rock nearby into two. [p.&nbsp;99]{{citation needed|date=December 2019}}\n:b)The Mylords (108)\nThe Mylords are not Christians, because nobody ever saw them cross themselves. They originate from the old pagan inhabitants of Delphi who kept their property in castle called Adelphi, named after the two brother princes who built it. When Christ and his mother came to the site, and all people around converted to Christianity they thought that they should better leave; thus the Mylords left for the West and took all their belongings with them. The Mylords come here now and worship these stones.

He served as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS), the Army's professional head, from 1963 until 1966, and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), forerunner of the role of Australia's [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]], from 1966 until 1970. His eight-year tenure as senior officer of first the Army and then the Australian military spanned almost the entire period of the nation's [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|involvement in the Vietnam War]].\n\nBorn in [[Sydney]], Wilton entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1927. Owing to lack of opportunity in the Australian military at the time, he took a commission in the [[British Army]] following his graduation in 1930. He spent most of the remainder of the decade with the [[Royal Artillery]] in [[British Raj|India]]. Wilton returned to Australia on the eve of World War&nbsp;II and was commissioned into the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. He saw action with the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th&nbsp;Division]] in [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Syria]] and the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] in [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]], earning a [[mention in despatches]] in the former campaign and the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in the latter.  Finishing the war a temporary [[colonel]], he was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1947. Wilton was posted to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1953 to take command of the [[28th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|28th&nbsp;Commonwealth Brigade]], leading it in its [[Battle of the Samichon River|final action of the war]] in July. He was raised to [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] and awarded the US [[Legion of Merit]] for his performance in Korea.\n\nWilton was promoted to [[major general]] in 1957 and became Commandant of Duntroon. He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1962 and made CGS the following January, with the rank of [[lieutenant general]]. As CGS he oversaw a reorganisation of the Army's [[Division (military)|divisional]] structure, the reintroduction of conscription, and deployments during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia\u2013Malaysia ''Konfrontasi'']] and the Vietnam War. Knighted in 1964, he handed over the position of CGS in May 1966 and was appointed CCOSC. In this role he had overall responsibility for Australia's forces in Vietnam, and worked to achieve an integrated defence organisation, including a [[Australian Defence Force Academy|tri-services academy]], a [[Joint Intelligence Organisation (Australia)|joint intelligence group]], and the amalgamation of separate [[Department of the Army (Australia)|government departments for the Army]], [[Department of the Navy (Australia)|Navy]] and [[Department of Air (Australia)|Air Force]]. Wilton was promoted to [[general]] in September 1968, and retired from the military in November 1970.

In what the [[The Official History of Australia's Involvement in Southeast Asian Conflicts 1948\u20131975|official history of Australia in the Vietnam War]] described as a \"pragmatic and far-sighted approach\", Wilton expressed his hope that such an arrangement would give the Air Force a closer understanding of land/air cooperation, and avoid \"increasing differences of views about strategic and tactical concepts with the Australian Armed Forces\".<ref>Coulthard-Clark, ''The RAAF in Vietnam'', pp. 79\u201381, 83</ref> Following the Federal government's decision in March 1966 to despatch a [[1st Australian Task Force|task force of two battalions]] to Vietnam, Wilton negotiated with US and South Vietnamese commanders a self-contained area of operations for the Australians, in [[Ph\u01b0\u1edbc Tuy Province|Phuoc Tuy Province]], where they could function with a reasonable degree of independence.<ref name=ADB/><ref name=\"Commanders 327\">McNeill, \"General Sir John Wilton\", p. 327</ref> He also approved [[Nui Dat]], in the centre of the province forward of the major population areas, as the task force's main base, despite its distance from support units in [[V\u0169ng T\u00e0u|Vung Tau]] and the extra effort required to defend it.<ref>McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', pp. 197\u2013200</ref> Wilton rejected a mobile role for the Australians that would have placed them under the control of a US division because, he believed, \"their operations became a bit of a meat grinder\" with \"tremendous casualties\".<ref>McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', pp. 200\u2013201</ref> On 19&nbsp;May 1966, he took over from Air Chief Marshal [[Frederick Scherger|Sir Frederick Scherger]] as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), a position foreshadowing that of the modern [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]].<ref name=\"Commanders 328\">McNeill, \"General Sir John Wilton\", p. 328</ref><ref name=\"CDF\">{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.gov.au/CDF/PreviousChiefs.asp |title=Chief of the Defence Force|publisher= [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]|accessdate=28 April 2015}}</ref> He was succeeded as CGS by Lieutenant General Daly.<ref name=\"Commanders 328\"/> According to the official history, the timing of the CCOSC handover was \"especially significant\" as it \"coincided with the change in Vietnam from an Army force which was responsible to the Chief of the General Staff to a combined force responsive to the Chairman, Chiefs of Staff Committee. Wilton, therefore, carried through his responsibilities concerning the Vietnam commitment to his new appointment.\"<ref>McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', p. 205</ref>\n\n===Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee===\n\n====Vietnam====\nWilton accepted the [[domino theory]] and never wavered in his commitment to Vietnam, but as early as mid-1967 he doubted that the war could be won unless the US was prepared to go all out and invade the [[North Vietnam|North]].<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. XV, XIX, 279</ref><ref name=Offensive>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 286\u2013287</ref> Cautious about expanding Australia's involvement, he advocated deploying a [[Centurion tank]] squadron rather than a third infantry battalion when calls came to increase the strength of the task force in Vietnam, but in the end the Federal government announced both commitments in October 1967.<ref>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 246\u2013249</ref> Wilton also advised the government to reject any requests from the US command in Vietnam to rotate the Australian task force out of Phuoc Tuy and display its capabilities in a wider operational arena, reasoning that it was more important for the troops to remain in the countryside they knew and continue to build relations with the local people.<ref name=Offensive/> He nevertheless strongly backed the Australian task force commander, Brigadier [[Ronald Lawrence Hughes|Ronald Hughes]], when the latter was criticised at home for conducting \"American style operations\" outside the immediate vicinity of Phuoc Tuy, such as the set-piece battles of [[Battle of Coral\u2013Balmoral|Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral]] in mid-1968.<ref>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 402, 410</ref> Conflict continued to simmer between the Army and the RAAF regarding air support, and Wilton oversaw discussions between Daly and Murdoch that secured a separate Army air organisation, leading to the formation of the [[Australian Army Aviation|Australian Army Aviation Corps]] in July 1968.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 301\u2013303</ref> On 22&nbsp;August, the Federal government announced that Wilton would be promoted to [[General (Australia)|general]], effective 1&nbsp;September, in recognition of his \"outstanding contribution to the Commonwealth in his present appointment\".<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 289, 407</ref> He was the first Australian officer to attain the rank since Blamey, twenty-seven years before.<ref name=\"Strategic Command XIV\">Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p.

Wilton, Daly and other senior officers argued that the \"balanced\" nature of the Australian task force would be damaged by a piecemeal withdrawal and that the only valid form of reduction would be \"one out, all out\"; the government chose a phased withdrawal, pulling out one battalion in October 1970 and the other two in October and December 1971.<ref>Edwards, ''A Nation at War'', pp. 202\u2013204</ref><ref>Ekins; McNeill, ''Fighting to the Finish'', pp. xxxv\u2013xxxvi</ref>  The divisive nature of the war caused conflict within Wilton's own family; all his children actively opposed it, and in September 1969 his son Robert publicly burnt his draft deferment notice outside [[Parliament House, Canberra]], having earlier called upon students at the [[Australian National University]] not to register for national service. ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' ran an article on the Parliament House incident, complete with a photograph of Robert burning his notice. As Australia's senior soldier, Wilton refused to comment on the situation; Robert reported that he and his father respected one another's viewpoints, and relations within the family remained amicable.<ref>Edwards, ''A Nation at War'', pp. 212\u2013213</ref><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. XX</ref>\n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of Australia's conduct of the Vietnam War had been the employment of a barrier minefield around Phuoc Tuy from 1967 to 1969. Wilton maintained that the minefield was already under construction when he first learned of it, and that he considered the decision within the purview of the commander on the ground, Brigadier [[Stuart Clarence Graham|Stuart Graham]]. When confronted with the increasing casualties among Australian troops from mines evidently lifted from the area by the Viet Cong, he pointed out that the South Vietnamese, who had been expected to patrol the minefield, were not playing their part. Wilton further believed that the barrier minefield was an innovative solution to the problems facing the task force and that the commander's decision to implement it was \"better than sitting on his backside and not trying anything\". He rejected suggestions by critics that the minefield was \"the biggest blunder\" Australia made in Vietnam, declaring that this was \"like being wise after the event\".<ref>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 127\u2013129</ref><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 328\u2013330</ref>\n\n====Joint defence aspirations====\n[[File:Lt Gen John Wilton (AWM VN-66-0105-03).JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.30| Lieutenant General Wilton as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, with Group Captain [[Peter Raw]] (left) and Major General [[Kenneth MacKay (general)|Kenneth MacKay]] (centre) at Vung Tau Airfield, South Vietnam, in 1966|alt=Informal portrait of three men in military uniforms]]\nWilton's position as CCOSC had no statutory authority over the heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, nor a direct line of command to Australian Forces Vietnam.

While nothing came of this at the time,<ref name=\"Andrews 184\"/> Wilton was consulted by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] prior to its reorganisation of the Defence Department, which it commenced soon after defeating the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] in the December 1972 Federal election.<ref>Andrews, ''The Department of Defence'', pp. 196\u2013197</ref> The following year, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]; by 1984, the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of the Defence Force, directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.<ref>Horner, \"The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements\", pp. 24\u201327</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nWilton was succeeded as CCOSC by Admiral [[Victor Smith|Sir Victor Smith]] on 23&nbsp;November 1970, and retired from the military.<ref name=ADB/><ref name=\"CDF\"/> He subsequently worked on the [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Kerr Committee]] that reviewed pay and conditions in the armed forces, visiting several overseas bases including Nui Dat and Vung Tau.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 361\u2013362</ref> Wilton finished his career as a diplomat, serving as Australia's [[Consul (representative)|Consul-General]] in New York from September 1973 to November 1975.<ref name=ADB/><ref>Moore, ''Duntroon'', p. 433</ref> In 1979 he became one of the first sponsors of the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, which advocated for a treaty between the Federal government and [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] representatives.

He served as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the General Staff]] (CGS), the Army's professional head, from 1963 until 1966, and as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee (CCOSC), forerunner of the role of Australia's [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]], from 1966 until 1970. His eight-year tenure as senior officer of first the Army and then the Australian military spanned almost the entire period of the nation's [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|involvement in the Vietnam War]].\n\nBorn in [[Sydney]], Wilton entered the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]], in 1927. Owing to lack of opportunity in the Australian military at the time, he took a commission in the [[British Army]] following his graduation in 1930. He spent most of the remainder of the decade with the [[Royal Artillery]] in [[British Raj|India]]. Wilton returned to Australia on the eve of World War&nbsp;II and was commissioned into the [[Royal Australian Artillery]]. He saw action with the [[7th Division (Australia)|7th&nbsp;Division]] in [[Syria-Lebanon Campaign|Syria]] and the [[3rd Division (Australia)|3rd Division]] in [[New Guinea Campaign|New Guinea]], earning a [[mention in despatches]] in the former campaign and the [[Distinguished Service Order]] in the latter.  Finishing the war a temporary [[colonel]], he was appointed an [[Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] in 1947. Wilton was posted to [[Korean War|Korea]] in 1953 to take command of the [[28th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|28th&nbsp;Commonwealth Brigade]], leading it in its [[Battle of the Samichon River|final action of the war]] in July. He was raised to [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire]] and awarded the US [[Legion of Merit]] for his performance in Korea.\n\nWilton was promoted to [[major general]] in 1957 and became Commandant of Duntroon. He was appointed a [[Companion of the Order of the Bath]] in 1962 and made CGS the following January, with the rank of [[lieutenant general]]. As CGS he oversaw a reorganisation of the Army's [[Division (military)|divisional]] structure, the reintroduction of conscription, and deployments during the [[Indonesia\u2013Malaysia confrontation|Indonesia\u2013Malaysia ''Konfrontasi'']] and the Vietnam War. Knighted in 1964, he handed over the position of CGS in May 1966 and was appointed CCOSC. In this role he had overall responsibility for Australia's forces in Vietnam, and worked to achieve an integrated defence organisation, including a [[Australian Defence Force Academy|tri-services academy]], a [[Joint Intelligence Organisation (Australia)|joint intelligence group]], and the amalgamation of separate [[Department of the Army (Australia)|government departments for the Army]], [[Department of the Navy (Australia)|Navy]] and [[Department of Air (Australia)|Air Force]].

Wilton, therefore, carried through his responsibilities concerning the Vietnam commitment to his new appointment.\"<ref>McNeill, ''To Long Tan'', p. 205</ref>\n\n===Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee===\n\n====Vietnam====\nWilton accepted the [[domino theory]] and never wavered in his commitment to Vietnam, but as early as mid-1967 he doubted that the war could be won unless the US was prepared to go all out and invade the [[North Vietnam|North]].<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. XV, XIX, 279</ref><ref name=Offensive>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 286\u2013287</ref> Cautious about expanding Australia's involvement, he advocated deploying a [[Centurion tank]] squadron rather than a third infantry battalion when calls came to increase the strength of the task force in Vietnam, but in the end the Federal government announced both commitments in October 1967.<ref>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 246\u2013249</ref> Wilton also advised the government to reject any requests from the US command in Vietnam to rotate the Australian task force out of Phuoc Tuy and display its capabilities in a wider operational arena, reasoning that it was more important for the troops to remain in the countryside they knew and continue to build relations with the local people.<ref name=Offensive/> He nevertheless strongly backed the Australian task force commander, Brigadier [[Ronald Lawrence Hughes|Ronald Hughes]], when the latter was criticised at home for conducting \"American style operations\" outside the immediate vicinity of Phuoc Tuy, such as the set-piece battles of [[Battle of Coral\u2013Balmoral|Fire Support Bases Coral and Balmoral]] in mid-1968.<ref>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 402, 410</ref> Conflict continued to simmer between the Army and the RAAF regarding air support, and Wilton oversaw discussions between Daly and Murdoch that secured a separate Army air organisation, leading to the formation of the [[Australian Army Aviation|Australian Army Aviation Corps]] in July 1968.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 301\u2013303</ref> On 22&nbsp;August, the Federal government announced that Wilton would be promoted to [[General (Australia)|general]], effective 1&nbsp;September, in recognition of his \"outstanding contribution to the Commonwealth in his present appointment\".<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 289, 407</ref> He was the first Australian officer to attain the rank since Blamey, twenty-seven years before.<ref name=\"Strategic Command XIV\">Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p.

Wilton, Daly and other senior officers argued that the \"balanced\" nature of the Australian task force would be damaged by a piecemeal withdrawal and that the only valid form of reduction would be \"one out, all out\"; the government chose a phased withdrawal, pulling out one battalion in October 1970 and the other two in October and December 1971.<ref>Edwards, ''A Nation at War'', pp. 202\u2013204</ref><ref>Ekins; McNeill, ''Fighting to the Finish'', pp. xxxv\u2013xxxvi</ref>  The divisive nature of the war caused conflict within Wilton's own family; all his children actively opposed it, and in September 1969 his son Robert publicly burnt his draft deferment notice outside [[Parliament House, Canberra]], having earlier called upon students at the [[Australian National University]] not to register for national service. ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' ran an article on the Parliament House incident, complete with a photograph of Robert burning his notice. As Australia's senior soldier, Wilton refused to comment on the situation; Robert reported that he and his father respected one another's viewpoints, and relations within the family remained amicable.<ref>Edwards, ''A Nation at War'', pp. 212\u2013213</ref><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', p. XX</ref>\n\nOne of the most controversial aspects of Australia's conduct of the Vietnam War had been the employment of a barrier minefield around Phuoc Tuy from 1967 to 1969. Wilton maintained that the minefield was already under construction when he first learned of it, and that he considered the decision within the purview of the commander on the ground, Brigadier [[Stuart Clarence Graham|Stuart Graham]]. When confronted with the increasing casualties among Australian troops from mines evidently lifted from the area by the Viet Cong, he pointed out that the South Vietnamese, who had been expected to patrol the minefield, were not playing their part. Wilton further believed that the barrier minefield was an innovative solution to the problems facing the task force and that the commander's decision to implement it was \"better than sitting on his backside and not trying anything\". He rejected suggestions by critics that the minefield was \"the biggest blunder\" Australia made in Vietnam, declaring that this was \"like being wise after the event\".<ref>McNeill; Ekins, ''On the Offensive'', pp. 127\u2013129</ref><ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 328\u2013330</ref>\n\n====Joint defence aspirations====\n[[File:Lt Gen John Wilton (AWM VN-66-0105-03).JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.30| Lieutenant General Wilton as Chairman of the Chiefs of Staff Committee, with Group Captain [[Peter Raw]] (left) and Major General [[Kenneth MacKay (general)|Kenneth MacKay]] (centre) at Vung Tau Airfield, South Vietnam, in 1966|alt=Informal portrait of three men in military uniforms]]\nWilton's position as CCOSC had no statutory authority over the heads of the Army, Navy and Air Force, nor a direct line of command to Australian Forces Vietnam.

While nothing came of this at the time,<ref name=\"Andrews 184\"/> Wilton was consulted by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] prior to its reorganisation of the Defence Department, which it commenced soon after defeating the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberals]] in the December 1972 Federal election.<ref>Andrews, ''The Department of Defence'', pp. 196\u2013197</ref> The following year, the single-service ministries were abolished in favour of an all-encompassing [[Department of Defence (Australia)|Department of Defence]]; by 1984, the CCOSC position had evolved to become the Chief of the Defence Force, directly commanding all three armed services through their respective chiefs.<ref>Horner, \"The Evolution of Australian Higher Command Arrangements\", pp. 24\u201327</ref>\n\n==Later life==\nWilton was succeeded as CCOSC by Admiral [[Victor Smith|Sir Victor Smith]] on 23&nbsp;November 1970, and retired from the military.<ref name=ADB/><ref name=\"CDF\"/> He subsequently worked on the [[John Kerr (governor-general)|Kerr Committee]] that reviewed pay and conditions in the armed forces, visiting several overseas bases including Nui Dat and Vung Tau.<ref>Horner, ''Strategic Command'', pp. 361\u2013362</ref> Wilton finished his career as a diplomat, serving as Australia's [[Consul (representative)|Consul-General]] in New York from September 1973 to November 1975.<ref name=ADB/><ref>Moore, ''Duntroon'', p. 433</ref> In 1979 he became one of the first sponsors of the Aboriginal Treaty Committee, which advocated for a treaty between the Federal government and [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] representatives.

Adults measure {{convert|7-12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total and are usually dark grey to blue on the back and sides, with an orange belly and throat. Males are more conspicuously coloured than the drab females, especially during breeding season.\n\nThe alpine newt occurs at high altitude as well as in the lowlands. Living mainly in forested land habitats for most of the year, the adults migrate to puddles, ponds, lakes or similar water bodies for breeding. Males court females with a ritualised [[courtship display|display]] and deposit a [[spermatophore]]. After fertilisation, females usually fold their eggs into leaves of water plants. The [[larva]]e grow up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} before [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into terrestrial [[eft]]s. [[Paedomorphic]] adults, which keep their [[gills]] and stay aquatic, are common. Larvae and adults feed mainly on diverse [[invertebrates]] and fall themselves prey to [[dragonfly]] larvae, large [[beetles]], fish, snakes, birds or mammals.\n\n[[Populations]] of the alpine newt have started to diverge around 20 [[million years ago]]. At least four [[subspecies]] are distinguished, and some argue there are several distinct, [[cryptic species|cryptic]] species. Although still relatively common and classified at [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], alpine newt populations are decreasing and have locally gone extinct. The main threats are [[habitat destruction]], [[water pollution|pollution]] and the introduction of fish such as [[trout]] into breeding sites.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Nomenclature===\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768 by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]], as ''Triton alpestris'' from the [[\u00d6tscher]] mountain in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin).{{r|Laurenti1768}} He used that name for a female and described the male (''Triton salamandroides'') and the larva (''Proteus tritonius'') as different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in the genus ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. After this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages based on genetic evidence,{{r|TitusLarson1995|WeisrockPapenfuss2006|SteinfartzVicario2007}} the alpine newt was split off by [[Mario Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds]] and colleagues as the [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, the name ''Ichthyosaura'' was already introduced in 1801 by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] for \"''Proteus tritonius''\", the larva of the alpine newt.{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} It therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}} \"Ichthyosaura\", Greek for \"fish lizard\", refers to a [[nymph]]-like creature in [[classical mythology]].{{r|Schmidtler2009}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n\nFour [[subspecies]] (see table below) were recognised for the alpine newt by [[Zbyn\u011bk Ro\u010dek]] and colleagues (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} followed by later authors,{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} while a number of previously described subspecies were not retained. The four subspecies correspond only in part to the five major lineages identified within the species (see section ''Evolution'' below): The western [[population]]s of the [[nominate subspecies]] ''I. a. alpestris'', together with the [[Cantabrian Mountains|Cantabrian]] ''I. a. cyreni'' and the [[Apennines|Apennine]] ''I. a. apuana'' form one group, while the eastern populations of ''I. a. alpestris'' are genetically closer to the Greek ''I. a. veluchiensis''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Differences in body shape and colour between the subspecies are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}}\n\nSeveral authors argued that the ancient lineages of the alpine newt might represent [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} [[Jean Raffa\u00eblli]] therefore distinguished four species in 2018,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this was considered premature by [[Darrel Frost]] in 2020.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n! colspan=2; style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Subspecies{{r|1=Rocek2003|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=214|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=16-36}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Raffa\u00eblli (2018) classification{{r|Raffaelli2018}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" |  Distribution \n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| rowspan=2 | ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|(Laurenti, 1768)}}<br>\u2013 Alpine newt || western populations || retained as ''I. alpestris alpestris'' || Northwestern France to northern Carpathians in Romania, southern Denmark in to Alps and France just north of the Mediterranean\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| eastern populations || ''I. reiseri'' (species), with subspecies ''reiseri'', ''carpathica'' and ''montenegrina'' || [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece to Bulgaria and southern Carpathians in Romania\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|(Gray, 1850)}}<br>\u2013 Apennine alpine newt || ''I. apuana'' (species), with subspecies ''apuana'' and ''inexpectata'' (Calabria) || Extreme southeastern France, Apennines to [[Lazio]] in central Italy, isolated populations in [[Calabria]]\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|(Mertens & Muller, 1940)}}<br>\u2013 Cantabrian alpine newt || retained || Spain: Cantabrian mountains and [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] (introduced)\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|(Wolterstorff, 1935)}}<br>\u2013 Greek alpine newt || ''I. veluchiensis'' (species) || Greece: mainland and northern [[Peloponnese]]\n\n|}\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt populations have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular clock]] estimate by [[Ernesto Recuero]] and colleagues.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Known fossil remains are much more recent: they were found in the [[Pliocene]] of Slovakia{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=38}} and the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be the [[sister species]] of the alpine newt.{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses showed that alpine newts split into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which in part correspond to described subspecies (see section ''Distribution and subspecies'' above).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These ancient genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the Miocene or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages probably took place. Populations from [[Vlasina Lake]] in Serbia have [[mitochondrial DNA]] that is distinct from all other populations and may represent a [[ghost lineage]] inherited from a now extinct ancestor population.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of retreat into [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]], expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|ChiocchioBisconti2017}}\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Bergmolchwerbung_2.jpg|thumb|right|Dorsal view of a male (bright blue, left) courting a female (mottled grey, right) in a shallow pond]]\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_aplestris_ventral_view_chrischan.jpeg|thumb|right|Throat and belly are orange and usually unspotted.]]\n\nThe alpine newt is a medium-sized, stocky newt species. It reaches {{convert|7\u201312|cm|in|abbr=on}} length in total, with females roughly {{convert|1\u20132|cm|in|abbr=on}} longer than males. The tail is compressed sideways and half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low (up to 2.5 mm), smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=10-13}}\n\nThe characteristic dark grey to bright blue colour of the back and sides, mainly in males, is strongest during breeding season. This base colour may vary to greenish and is more drab and mottled in females. The belly and throat are orange and only occasionally (especially in the subspecies ''I. a. apuana'') have dark spots. Males have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Juvenile [[eft]]s, just after [[metamorphosis]], resemble adult terrestrial females, but sometimes have a red or yellow line on the back. Very rarely, [[leucistic]] individuals have been observed.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=12-36}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u201311 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|3\u20135|cm|in|abbr=on}} just before metamorphosis. They initially have only two small filaments (balancers), between the eyes and [[gills]] on each side of the head, which later disappear when the fore- and then the hindlegs develop.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=97-104}} The larvae are light brown to yellow and initially have dark longitudinal stripes, which later dissove into a dark pigmentation that is stronger towards the tail. The tail is pointed and sometimes ends in a short filament. Alpine newt larvae are more robust and have wider heads than those of the [[smooth newt]] and [[palmate newt]].{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=13-14}}\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe. It is relatively common over a large, more or less continuous range from northwestern France to the [[Carpathians]] in Romania, and from southern Denmark in the north to the [[Alps]] and France just north of the Mediterranean in the south, but absent from the [[Pannonian basin]]. Isolated areas of distribution in Spain, Italy and Greece correspond to distinct subspecies (see section ''Taxonomy: Subspecies'' above).{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=39-46|3=RecueroBuckley2014|4=Raffaelli2018}} Alpine newts have been deliberately [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various places in continental Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\nThe alpine newt can occur at high elevation and has been found up to {{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] in the Alps. However, it does occur in the lowlands down to sea level. Towards the south of its range, most populations are found above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=51-59}}\n\n==Habitats==\n\nForests, including both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests (pure [[Picea abies|spruce]] plantations are avoided), are the main land habitat. Less common are forest edges, [[brownfield land]], or gardens. Populations can be found above [[tree line]] in the high mountains, where they prefer south-exposed slopes. The newts use logs, stones, leaf litter, [[burrow]]s, [[construction waste]] or similar structures as hiding places.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=54-59}}\n\nAquatic breeding sites close to adequate land habitat are critical. While small, cool water bodies in forested areas are preferred, alpine newts tolerate a wide range of permanent or [[vernal pool|non-permanent]], natural or human-made water bodies. These can range from shallow puddles over small ponds to larger, fish-free lakes or reservoirs and quiet parts of streams. Damming by [[Eurasian beaver|beavers]] creates suitable breeding sites. Overall, the alpine newt is tolerant regarding chemical parameters such as [[pH]], [[water hardness]] and [[eutrophication]]. Other European newts such as the [[Northern crested newt|crested]], smooth, palmate or [[Carpathian newt]] often use the same breeding sites, but are less common at higher elevation.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=47-54}}\n\n==Lifecycle and behaviour==\n\nAlpine newts are usually [[semiaquatic]], spending most of the year (9\u201310 months) on land and only returning to the water for breeding. The efts are probably terrestrial until they reach [[sexual maturity]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=54}} This happens after around three years in males, and four to five years in females. Alpine newts can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n===Terrestrial phase===\n\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile [[eft]] hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nOn land, alpine newts are mainly nocturnal, hiding most of the day and moving and feeding during the night or in the [[twighlight]]. [[Hibernation]] also usually takes place in terrestrial hiding places. They have been observed to climb up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high vertical walls of basement ducts, where they hibernated, on wet nights. {{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=105-107}} Migration to breeding sites occurs on sufficiently warm (above 5 \u00b0C) and humid nights and may be delayed or interrupted for several weeks in unfavourable conditions. The newts can also leave the water again in case of a sudden cold snap.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=89-90}}\n\nAlpine newts tend to stay close to their breeding sites and only a small proportion, mainly juvenile efts, [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to new habitats. A dispersal distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been observed, but such large distances are uncommon. Over short distances, the newts use mainly their smell for [[animal navigation|navigation]], while over long distances, orientation by the night sky, and potentially through [[magnetoreception]] are more important.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=122-128}} \n\n===Aquatic phase and breeding===\n\nThe aquatic phase starts at snow melt, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=87-90}} Some southern populations in Greece and Italy appear to stay aquatic most of the year and hibernate under water.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=104-105}} In the Apennine subspecies, ''I. a. apuana'', two rounds of breeding and egg-laying in autumn and spring have been observed .{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv|thumb|right|Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Males perform a [[courtship display]]. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while, then fans his tail to stimulate the female and wave [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with displays of rivals.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}} Experiments suggest that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females, while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}} In a breeding season, a male can produce more than 48 spermatophores, and offspring from one female usually have several fathers.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=83-86}}\n\n[[File:Triturus_alpestris_ovum.jpg|thumb|right|Egg with larvae just before hatching, note the longitudinal stripes]]\n\n[[File:MesotritonAlpestrisLarva1.JPG|thumb|right|Larva with fore- and hindlegs developed]]\n\nFemales wrap their eggs in leaves of water plants for protection, preferring leaves closer to the surface where temperatures are higher. Where no plants are available, they may also use leaf litter, dead wood or stones for egg deposition.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=94-104}} They can lay 70\u2013390 eggs in a season, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (2.5\u20133 mm including the jelly capsule). Incubation time is longer under cold conditions, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}} The larvae are [[benthic]], staying in general close to the bottom of the water body.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=98}} Metamorphosis occurs after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}}\n\n===Paedomorphy===\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_alpestris_apuanus05.jpg|thumb|right|Paedomorphic adult of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n\n[[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults do not metamorphose and instead retain their [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is more common in the alpine newt than in other European newts. It is almost exclusively found in the southern part of the range (but not in the Cantabrian subspecies, ''I. a. cyreni''). Paedomorphic adults are more pale in colour than metamorphic ones. Only part of a population is usually paedomorphic, and metamorphosis can follow if the pool dries out. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts sometimes prefer different prey, but they do interbreed. Overall, paedomorphy appears to be a facultative strategy under particular conditions which are not fully understood.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=60-65}}\n\n===Diet, predators and parasites===\n\nAlpine newts are diet generalists, taking mainly different [[invertebrates]] as prey. Larvae and adults living in the water eat for example various [[plankton]], larvae of insects such as [[chironomids]], crustaceans such as [[ostracods]] or [[amphipods]], and terrestrial insects falling on the surface. Amphibian eggs and larvae, including of the same species, are also eaten. Prey on land includes various insects, worms, spiders and [[isopods]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=68-72}}\n\n[[Predator]]s taking adult alpine newts are snakes such as the [[grass snake]], fish such as [[trout]], birds such as [[heron]]s or [[duck]]s, and mammals such as [[hedgehogs]], [[marten]]s or [[shrew]]s. Under water, large diving beetles (''[[Dytiscus]]'') can prey on newts, while small efts on land may be predated by ground beetles (''[[Carabus]]''). For eggs and larvae, diving beetles, fish, [[dragonfly]] larvae, and other newts are the main enemies.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=73-77}}\n\nThreatened adult newts often take on a defensive position, where they expose the [[aposematism|warning colour]] of their belly by bending backwards or raising their tail and secrete a milky substance. They also sometimes produce sounds, whose function is however unknown.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}}\n\nParasites include [[parasitic worm]]s, [[leeches]], the ciliate ''[[Balantidium elongatum]]'', and potentially [[Lucilia bufonivora|toadflies]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=77}} A [[ranavirus]] transmitted to alpine newts from [[midwife toad]]s in Spain caused bleeding and [[necrosis]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=142}} The [[chytridiomycosis]]-causing fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has been found in wild populations,<ref name=\"ZampigliaCanestrelli2013\"/> and the emerging ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|B. salamandrivorans]]'' was lethal for alpine newts in laboratory experiments.<ref name=\"MartelBlooi2014\"/>\n\n==Captivity==\n\nSeveral subspecies of the alpine newt have been bred in captivity, including a population from [[Proko\u0161ko Lake]] in Bosnia that is now probably extinct in the wild. Efts often return to the water after only one year. Captive individuals have reached an age of 15-20 years.{{r|1=Raffaelli2014|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=217}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt was classified as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] in 2009. The population trend however is \"Decreasing\", and the different geographic lineages, which may represent [[evolutionary significant units]], have not been evaluated separately.{{r|iucn}} Several populations in the Balkans, some of which have been described as subspecies of their own, are highly threatened or have even gone extinct.{{r|1=Raffaelli2018|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=133-134}}\n\nThreats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats. [[European beaver|Beavers]], previously widespread in Europe, were probably important in maintaining breeding sites. Introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]] such as trout, and potentially [[crayfish]] is a significant threat that can eradicate populations from a breeding site. In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades. Lack of adequate, undisturbed land habitat (see section ''Habitats'' above) and [[wildlife corridor|dispersal corridors]] around and between breeding sites, is another problem.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=130-144}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by chytridiomycosis,{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, eradication was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3\u20134 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite web | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ChiocchioBisconti2017\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chiocchio | first1 = A. | last2 = Bisconti | first2 = R. | last3 = Zampiglia | first3 = M. |last4 = Nascetti | first4 = G. | last5 = Canestrelli | first5 = D. | title = Quaternary history, population genetic structure and diversity of the cold-adapted Alpine newt ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' in peninsular Italy | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 2017 | pages = 2955 | issn = 2045-2322 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-03116-x| pmid = 28592856 | pmc = 5462806 | bibcode = 2017NatSR...7.2955C }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ Cite document |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

to [[continental Europe]] and introduced to [[Great Britain]] and [[New Zealand]]. Adults measure {{convert|7-12|cm|in|abbr=on}} in total and are usually dark grey to blue on the back and sides, with an orange belly and throat. Males are more conspicuously coloured than the drab females, especially during breeding season.\n\nThe alpine newt occurs at high altitude as well as in the lowlands. Living mainly in forested land habitats for most of the year, the adults migrate to puddles, ponds, lakes or similar water bodies for breeding. Males court females with a ritualised [[courtship display|display]] and deposit a [[spermatophore]]. After fertilisation, females usually fold their eggs into leaves of water plants. The [[larva]]e grow up to {{convert|5|cm|in|abbr=on}} before [[metamorphosis|metamorphosing]] into terrestrial [[eft]]s. [[Paedomorphic]] adults, which keep their [[gills]] and stay aquatic, are common. Larvae and adults feed mainly on diverse [[invertebrates]] and fall themselves prey to [[dragonfly]] larvae, large [[beetles]], fish, snakes, birds or mammals.\n\n[[Populations]] of the alpine newt have started to diverge around 20 [[million years ago]]. At least four [[subspecies]] are distinguished, and some argue there are several distinct, [[cryptic species|cryptic]] species. Although still relatively common and classified at [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]], alpine newt populations are decreasing and have locally gone extinct. The main threats are [[habitat destruction]], [[water pollution|pollution]] and the introduction of fish such as [[trout]] into breeding sites.\n\n==Taxonomy==\n\n===Nomenclature===\n\nThe alpine newt was first described in 1768 by Austrian zoologist [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]], as ''Triton alpestris'' from the [[\u00d6tscher]] mountain in the Austrian Alps (''alpestris'' meaning \"alpine\" in Latin).{{r|Laurenti1768}} He used that name for a female and described the male (''Triton salamandroides'') and the larva (''Proteus tritonius'') as different species.{{r|Schmidtler2007}} Later, the alpine newt was placed in the genus ''[[Triturus]]'' along with most other European newts. After this genus was found to contain several unrelated lineages based on genetic evidence,{{r|TitusLarson1995|WeisrockPapenfuss2006|SteinfartzVicario2007}} the alpine newt was split off by [[Mario Garc\u00eda-Par\u00eds]] and colleagues as the [[monotypic]] genus ''Mesotriton'' in 2004,{{r|Garcia-Paris2004}} which had been erected as a [[subgenus]] by [[Istv\u00e1n J\u00f3zsef Bolkay]] in 1928.{{r|Bolkay1928}} However, the name ''Ichthyosaura'' was already introduced in 1801 by [[Sonnini de Manoncourt]] and [[Latreille]] for \"''Proteus tritonius''\", the larva of the alpine newt.{{r|SonniniLatreille1802|p=310}} It therefore has priority over ''Mesotriton'' and is the [[valid name (zoology)|valid]] genus name.{{r|1=Schmidtler2009|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=9-10}} \"Ichthyosaura\", Greek for \"fish lizard\", refers to a [[nymph]]-like creature in [[classical mythology]].{{r|Schmidtler2009}}\n\n===Subspecies===\n\nFour [[subspecies]] (see table below) were recognised for the alpine newt by [[Zbyn\u011bk Ro\u010dek]] and colleagues (2003),{{r|Rocek2003}} followed by later authors,{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}} while a number of previously described subspecies were not retained. The four subspecies correspond only in part to the five major lineages identified within the species (see section ''Evolution'' below): The western [[population]]s of the [[nominate subspecies]] ''I. a. alpestris'', together with the [[Cantabrian Mountains|Cantabrian]] ''I. a. cyreni'' and the [[Apennines|Apennine]] ''I. a. apuana'' form one group, while the eastern populations of ''I. a. alpestris'' are genetically closer to the Greek ''I. a. veluchiensis''.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Differences in body shape and colour between the subspecies are not consistent.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=16-36}}\n\nSeveral authors argued that the ancient lineages of the alpine newt might represent [[cryptic species]].{{r|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} [[Jean Raffa\u00eblli]] therefore distinguished four species in 2018,{{r|Raffaelli2018}} but this was considered premature by [[Darrel Frost]] in 2020.{{r|Frost2020}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n! colspan=2; style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Subspecies{{r|1=Rocek2003|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=214|3=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p3=16-36}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" | Raffa\u00eblli (2018) classification{{r|Raffaelli2018}} !! style=\"background: rgb(235,235,210)\" |  Distribution \n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| rowspan=2 | ''I. a. alpestris'' {{small|(Laurenti, 1768)}}<br>\u2013 Alpine newt || western populations || retained as ''I. alpestris alpestris'' || Northwestern France to northern Carpathians in Romania, southern Denmark in to Alps and France just north of the Mediterranean\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| eastern populations || ''I. reiseri'' (species), with subspecies ''reiseri'', ''carpathica'' and ''montenegrina'' || [[Balkan peninsula]] north of Greece to Bulgaria and southern Carpathians in Romania\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. apuana'' {{small|(Gray, 1850)}}<br>\u2013 Apennine alpine newt || ''I. apuana'' (species), with subspecies ''apuana'' and ''inexpectata'' (Calabria) || Extreme southeastern France, Apennines to [[Lazio]] in central Italy, isolated populations in [[Calabria]]\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. cyreni'' {{small|(Mertens & Muller, 1940)}}<br>\u2013 Cantabrian alpine newt || retained || Spain: Cantabrian mountains and [[Sierra de Guadarrama]] (introduced)\n\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%\" |\n| colspan=2 | ''I. a. veluchiensis'' {{small|(Wolterstorff, 1935)}}<br>\u2013 Greek alpine newt || ''I. veluchiensis'' (species) || Greece: mainland and northern [[Peloponnese]]\n\n|}\n\n==Evolution==\n\nAlpine newt populations have separated since the [[Early Miocene]], around 20 [[million years ago]], according to a [[molecular clock]] estimate by [[Ernesto Recuero]] and colleagues.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} Known fossil remains are much more recent: they were found in the [[Pliocene]] of Slovakia{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=38}} and the [[Pleistocene]] of Northern Italy.{{r|VillaBlain2018}} An older, [[Miocene]] fossil from Germany, ''[[Ichthyosaura randeckensis]]'', may be the [[sister species]] of the alpine newt.{{r|Schoch2013}}\n\nMolecular phylogenetic analyses showed that alpine newts split into a western and an eastern group. Each of these again contains two major [[Lineage (evolution)|lineages]], which in part correspond to described subspecies (see section ''Distribution and subspecies'' above).{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|SotiropoulosEleftherakos2007}} These ancient genetic differences suggest that the alpine newt may be a [[species complex|complex]] of several distinct species.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|Frost2020|Raffaelli2018}} Higher temperatures during the Miocene or sea level oscillations may have separated early populations, leading to [[allopatric speciation]]. However, [[genetic admixture|admixture]] and [[introgression]] between lineages probably took place. Populations from [[Vlasina Lake]] in Serbia have [[mitochondrial DNA]] that is distinct from all other populations and may represent a [[ghost lineage]] inherited from a now extinct ancestor population.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014}} The [[Quaternary glaciation]] probably led to cycles of retreat into [[Refugium (population biology)|refugia]], expansion and range shifts.{{r|RecueroBuckley2014|ChiocchioBisconti2017}}\n\n==Description==\n\n[[File:Bergmolchwerbung_2.jpg|thumb|right|Dorsal view of a male (bright blue, left) courting a female (mottled grey, right) in a shallow pond]]\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_aplestris_ventral_view_chrischan.jpeg|thumb|right|Throat and belly are orange and usually unspotted.]]\n\nThe alpine newt is a medium-sized, stocky newt species. It reaches {{convert|7\u201312|cm|in|abbr=on}} length in total, with females roughly {{convert|1\u20132|cm|in|abbr=on}} longer than males. The tail is compressed sideways and half as long or slightly shorter than the rest of the body. During life in water, both sexes develop a tail [[fin]], and males a low (up to 2.5 mm), smooth-edged crest on the back. The [[cloaca]] of males swells during breeding season. The skin is smooth during and granular outside breeding season, and velvety during the land phase.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=10-13}}\n\nThe characteristic dark grey to bright blue colour of the back and sides, mainly in males, is strongest during breeding season. This base colour may vary to greenish and is more drab and mottled in females. The belly and throat are orange and only occasionally (especially in the subspecies ''I. a. apuana'') have dark spots. Males have a white band with black spots and a light blue flash running along the flanks, from the cheeks to the tail. Their crest, during breeding season, is white with regular dark spots. Juvenile [[eft]]s, just after [[metamorphosis]], resemble adult terrestrial females, but sometimes have a red or yellow line on the back. Very rarely, [[leucistic]] individuals have been observed.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=213|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=12-36}}\n\n[[Larvae]] are 7\u201311 mm long after hatching and grow to {{convert|3\u20135|cm|in|abbr=on}} just before metamorphosis. They initially have only two small filaments (balancers), between the eyes and [[gills]] on each side of the head, which later disappear when the fore- and then the hindlegs develop.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=97-104}} The larvae are light brown to yellow and initially have dark longitudinal stripes, which later dissove into a dark pigmentation that is stronger towards the tail. The tail is pointed and sometimes ends in a short filament. Alpine newt larvae are more robust and have wider heads than those of the [[smooth newt]] and [[palmate newt]].{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=13-14}}\n\n==Distribution==\n\nThe alpine newt is native to continental Europe. It is relatively common over a large, more or less continuous range from northwestern France to the [[Carpathians]] in Romania, and from southern Denmark in the north to the [[Alps]] and France just north of the Mediterranean in the south, but absent from the [[Pannonian basin]]. Isolated areas of distribution in Spain, Italy and Greece correspond to distinct subspecies (see section ''Taxonomy: Subspecies'' above).{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=214\u2013215|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=39-46|3=RecueroBuckley2014|4=Raffaelli2018}} Alpine newts have been deliberately [[Introduced species|introduced]] to various places in continental Europe, including within the boundaries of cities such as [[Bremen]] and [[Berlin]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=39-46}} More distant introductions have occurred to [[Great Britain]], mainly England but also Scotland,{{r|BondNHSN}} and New Zealand.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\nThe alpine newt can occur at high elevation and has been found up to {{convert|2370|m|ft|abbr=on}} [[above sea level]] in the Alps. However, it does occur in the lowlands down to sea level. Towards the south of its range, most populations are found above {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=51-59}}\n\n==Habitats==\n\nForests, including both [[deciduous forest|deciduous]] and [[coniferous]] forests (pure [[Picea abies|spruce]] plantations are avoided), are the main land habitat. Less common are forest edges, [[brownfield land]], or gardens. Populations can be found above [[tree line]] in the high mountains, where they prefer south-exposed slopes. The newts use logs, stones, leaf litter, [[burrow]]s, [[construction waste]] or similar structures as hiding places.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=54-59}}\n\nAquatic breeding sites close to adequate land habitat are critical. While small, cool water bodies in forested areas are preferred, alpine newts tolerate a wide range of permanent or [[vernal pool|non-permanent]], natural or human-made water bodies. These can range from shallow puddles over small ponds to larger, fish-free lakes or reservoirs and quiet parts of streams. Damming by [[Eurasian beaver|beavers]] creates suitable breeding sites. Overall, the alpine newt is tolerant regarding chemical parameters such as [[pH]], [[water hardness]] and [[eutrophication]]. Other European newts such as the [[Northern crested newt|crested]], smooth, palmate or [[Carpathian newt]] often use the same breeding sites, but are less common at higher elevation.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=47-54}}\n\n==Lifecycle and behaviour==\n\nAlpine newts are usually [[semiaquatic]], spending most of the year (9\u201310 months) on land and only returning to the water for breeding. The efts are probably terrestrial until they reach [[sexual maturity]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=54}} This happens after around three years in males, and four to five years in females. Alpine newts can reach an age of ten years in lowland. At higher altitude, maturity is reached only after 9-11 years, and the newts can grow up to 30 years old.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}}\n\n===Terrestrial phase===\n\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg | thumb | right | Juvenile [[eft]] hibernating in dead wood]]\n\nOn land, alpine newts are mainly nocturnal, hiding most of the day and moving and feeding during the night or in the [[twighlight]]. [[Hibernation]] also usually takes place in terrestrial hiding places. They have been observed to climb up to {{convert|2|m|ft}} high vertical walls of basement ducts, where they hibernated, on wet nights. {{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=105-107}} Migration to breeding sites occurs on sufficiently warm (above 5 \u00b0C) and humid nights and may be delayed or interrupted for several weeks in unfavourable conditions. The newts can also leave the water again in case of a sudden cold snap.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=89-90}}\n\nAlpine newts tend to stay close to their breeding sites and only a small proportion, mainly juvenile efts, [[Biological dispersal|disperse]] to new habitats. A dispersal distance of {{convert|4|km|mi|abbr=on}} has been observed, but such large distances are uncommon. Over short distances, the newts use mainly their smell for [[animal navigation|navigation]], while over long distances, orientation by the night sky, and potentially through [[magnetoreception]] are more important.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=122-128}} \n\n===Aquatic phase and breeding===\n\nThe aquatic phase starts at snow melt, from February in the lowlands to June at higher altitudes, while egg-laying follows a few months later and can continue until August.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=87-90}} Some southern populations in Greece and Italy appear to stay aquatic most of the year and hibernate under water.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=104-105}} In the Apennine subspecies, ''I. a. apuana'', two rounds of breeding and egg-laying in autumn and spring have been observed .{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=96}}\n\n[[File:Love-Is-Blind-Indiscriminate-Female-Mating-Responses-to-Male-Courtship-Pheromones-in-Newts-pone.0056538.s001.ogv|thumb|right|Stages of [[courtship display]], filmed in captivity{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}}]]\n\nBreeding behaviour occurs mainly in the morning and at dawn. Males perform a [[courtship display]]. The male first places himself in front of the female, remains static for a while, then fans his tail to stimulate the female and wave [[pheromones]] towards her. After leaning in and touching her snout, he creeps away, followed by the female. When she touches the base of his tail with her snout, he releases a sperm packet ([[spermatophore]]) and blocks the female's path so she picks it up with her cloaca. Several rounds of spermatophore deposition may follow. Males frequently interfere with displays of rivals.{{r|Sparreboom2014|p=215}} Experiments suggest that it is mainly male pheromones that trigger mating behaviour in females, while colour and other visual cues are less relevant.{{r|Wicker-ThomasTreer2013}} In a breeding season, a male can produce more than 48 spermatophores, and offspring from one female usually have several fathers.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=83-86}}\n\n[[File:Triturus_alpestris_ovum.jpg|thumb|right|Egg with larvae just before hatching, note the longitudinal stripes]]\n\n[[File:MesotritonAlpestrisLarva1.JPG|thumb|right|Larva with fore- and hindlegs developed]]\n\nFemales wrap their eggs in leaves of water plants for protection, preferring leaves closer to the surface where temperatures are higher. Where no plants are available, they may also use leaf litter, dead wood or stones for egg deposition.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=94-104}} They can lay 70\u2013390 eggs in a season, which are light grey-brown and 1.5\u20131.7 mm in diameter (2.5\u20133 mm including the jelly capsule). Incubation time is longer under cold conditions, but larvae typically hatch after two to four weeks.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}} The larvae are [[benthic]], staying in general close to the bottom of the water body.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=98}} Metamorphosis occurs after around three months, again depending on temperature, but some larvae overwinter and metamorphose only in the next year.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216}}\n\n===Paedomorphy===\n\n[[File:Mesotriton_alpestris_apuanus05.jpg|thumb|right|Paedomorphic adult of subspecies ''I. a. apuana'']]\n\n[[Paedomorphy]] (or neoteny), where adults do not metamorphose and instead retain their [[gill]]s and stay aquatic, is more common in the alpine newt than in other European newts. It is almost exclusively found in the southern part of the range (but not in the Cantabrian subspecies, ''I. a. cyreni''). Paedomorphic adults are more pale in colour than metamorphic ones. Only part of a population is usually paedomorphic, and metamorphosis can follow if the pool dries out. Paedomorphic and metamorphic newts sometimes prefer different prey, but they do interbreed. Overall, paedomorphy appears to be a facultative strategy under particular conditions which are not fully understood.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=60-65}}\n\n===Diet, predators and parasites===\n\nAlpine newts are diet generalists, taking mainly different [[invertebrates]] as prey. Larvae and adults living in the water eat for example various [[plankton]], larvae of insects such as [[chironomids]], crustaceans such as [[ostracods]] or [[amphipods]], and terrestrial insects falling on the surface. Amphibian eggs and larvae, including the same species, are also eaten. Prey on land includes various insects, worms, spiders or [[isopods]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=68-72}}\n\n[[Predator]]s taking adult alpine newts are snakes such as the [[grass snake]], fish such as [[trout]], birds such as [[heron]]s or [[duck]]s, and mammals such as [[hedgehogs]], [[marten]]s or [[shrew]]s. Under water, large diving beetles (''[[Dytiscus]]'') can prey on newts, while small efts on land may be predated by ground beetles (''[[Carabus]]''). For eggs and larvae, diving beetles, fish, [[dragonfly]] larvae, and other newts are the main enemies.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=73-77}}\n\nThreatened adult newts often take on a defensive position, where they expose the [[aposematism|warning colour]] of their belly by bending backwards or raising their tail and secrete a milky substance. They also sometimes produce sounds, whose function is however unknown.{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=74-75}}\n\nParasites include [[parasitic worm]]s, [[leeches]], the ciliate ''[[Balantidium elongatum]]'', and potentially [[Lucilia bufonivora|toadflies]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=77}} A [[ranavirus]] transmitted to alpine newts from [[midwife toad]]s in Spain caused bleeding and [[necrosis]].{{r|ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p=142}} The [[chytridiomycosis]]-causing fungus ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'' has been found in wild populations,<ref name=\"ZampigliaCanestrelli2013\"/> and the emerging ''[[Batrachochytrium salamandrivorans|B. salamandrivorans]]'' was lethal for alpine newts in laboratory experiments.<ref name=\"MartelBlooi2014\"/>\n\n==Captivity==\n\nSeveral subspecies of the alpine newt have been bred in captivity, including a population from [[Proko\u0161ko Lake]] in Bosnia that is now probably extinct in the wild. Efts often return to the water after only one year. Captive individuals have reached an age of 15-20 years.{{r|1=Raffaelli2014|2=Sparreboom2014|p2=217}}\n\n==Threats and conservation==\n\nBecause of its overall large range and populations that are not severely fragmented, the alpine newt was classified as [[Least Concern]] on the [[IUCN Red List]] in 2009. The population trend however is \"Decreasing\", and the different geographic lineages, which may represent [[evolutionary significant units]], have not been evaluated separately.{{r|iucn}} Several populations in the Balkans, some of which have been described as subspecies of their own, are highly threatened or have even gone extinct.{{r|1=Raffaelli2018|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=133-134}}\n\nThreats are similar to those affecting other newts and include mainly [[habitat destruction|destruction]] and [[water pollution|pollution]] of aquatic habitats. [[European beaver|Beavers]], previously widespread in Europe, were probably important in maintaining breeding sites. Introduction of fish, especially [[salmonids]] such as trout, and potentially [[crayfish]] is a significant threat that can eradicate populations from a breeding site. In the [[Montenegro|Montenegrin]] [[karst]] region, populations have declined as ponds created for cattle and human use were abandoned over the last decades. Lack of adequate, undisturbed land habitat (see section ''Habitats'' above) and [[wildlife corridor|dispersal corridors]] around and between breeding sites, is another problem.{{r|1=Sparreboom2014|p1=216|2=ThiesmeierSchulte2010|p2=130-144}}\n\nIntroduced alpine newts may themselves pose a threat to native amphibians if they carry disease. At least one introduced population in the United Kingdom was affected by chytridiomycosis,{{r|iucn}} and for the exotic subspecies ''I. a. apuana'' in New Zealand, eradication was recommended.{{r|Bell2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist | 30em | refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bell2016\">{{cite journal | last=Bell | first=B.D. | title = A review of potential alpine newt (''Ichthyosaura alpestris'') impacts on native frogs in New Zealand | journal = Journal of the Royal Society of New Zealand | volume = 46 | issue=3\u20134 | year = 2016 | pages = 214\u2013231 | issn=0303-6758 | doi = 10.1080/03036758.2016.1216455}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bolkay1928\">{{cite journal | last1 = Bolkay | first1 = J. | title = Die Sch\u00e4del der Salamandrinen, mit besonderer R\u00fccksicht auf ihre systematische Bedeutung | journal = Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Anatomie und Entwicklungsgeschichte | volume = 86 | issue = 3\u20134 | year = 1928 | pages = 259\u2013319 | issn = 0340-2061 |doi = 10.1007/BF02117989 | language = German}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"BondNHSN\">{{cite web | last1 = Bond | first1 = I. | title = Alpine Newt | year = 2020 | publisher = Natural History Society of Northumbria | url = https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ | accessdate = 5 April 2020 | archiveurl = | archive-date = 22 September 2019 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20190922004603/https://www.nhsn.ncl.ac.uk/interests/reptiles-amphibians/alpine-newt/ }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"ChiocchioBisconti2017\">{{cite journal | last1 = Chiocchio | first1 = A. | last2 = Bisconti | first2 = R. | last3 = Zampiglia | first3 = M. |last4 = Nascetti | first4 = G. | last5 = Canestrelli | first5 = D. | title = Quaternary history, population genetic structure and diversity of the cold-adapted Alpine newt ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' in peninsular Italy | journal = Scientific Reports | volume = 7 | issue = 1 | year = 2017 | pages = 2955 | issn = 2045-2322 | doi = 10.1038/s41598-017-03116-x| pmid = 28592856 | pmc = 5462806 | bibcode = 2017NatSR...7.2955C }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Frost2020\">{{ Cite document |last=Frost |first=D.R. | year = 2020 | title = ''Ichthyosaura alpestris'' (Laurenti, 1768).

Malta had the second-highest [[voter turnout]] in the world (and the highest for nations without [[mandatory voting]]), based on election turnout in national [[lower house]] elections from 1960 to 1995.<ref>Mark N. Franklin. \"Electoral Participation.\" in ''Controversies in Voting Behavior''</ref> The [[unicameral]] Parliament is made up of the [[President of Malta]] and the [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] ({{lang-mt|Kamra tad-Deputati}}). The President of Malta, a largely ceremonial position, is appointed for a five-year term by a resolution of the House of Representatives carried by a simple majority.  Members of the House of Representatives are elected by direct universal suffrage through [[single transferable vote]] every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the president either on advice of the [[Prime Minister of Malta|prime minister]] or through the adoption of a motion of no confidence carried within the House of Representatives and not overturned within three days. In either of these cases, the president may alternatively choose to invite another Member of Parliament who invariably should command the majority of the House of Representatives to form an alternative government for the remainder of the legislature.\n\nThe House of Representatives is nominally made up of 65 members of parliament whereby 5 members of parliament are elected from each of the thirteen electoral districts. However, where a party wins an absolute majority of votes, but does not have a majority of seats, that party is given additional seats to ensure a parliamentary majority. The 80th article of the [[Constitution of Malta]] provides that the president appoint as prime minister \"... the member of the House of Representatives who, in his judgment, is best able to command the support of a majority of the members of that House\".<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\nMaltese politics is a [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Laburista}}), a centre-left [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Nazzjonalista}}), a centre-right [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] party. The Labour Party has been the governing party since 2013, and is currently led by Prime Minister [[Robert Abela]], who has been in office since 13 January 2020. The Nationalist Party, with [[Adrian Delia]] as its leader, is currently in opposition. Two parliamentary seats are held by [[independent politician]]s who were formerly with the [[Democratic Party (Malta)|Democratic Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Demokratiku}}), a centre-left [[social liberalism|social liberal]] party which had contested under the Nationalist-led [[Forza Nazzjonali]] electoral alliance in 2017.

Councillors are elected every four years through the [[single transferable vote]]. People who are eligible to vote in the election of the Maltese [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] as well as resident [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the EU]] are eligible to vote. Due to system reforms, no elections were held before 2012. Since then, elections have been held every two years for an alternating half of the councils.\n\nLocal councils are responsible for the general upkeep and embellishment of the locality (including repairs to non-arterial roads), allocation of local wardens and refuse collection; they also carry out general administrative duties for the central government such as collection of government rents and funds and answer government-related public inquiries.

It has been a place of pilgrimage since the medieval period.\n\nThe Acts of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] record that in 451 AD a certain Acacius was Bishop of Malta (''Melitenus Episcopus''). It is also known that in 501 AD, a certain Constantinus, ''Episcopus Melitenensis'', was present at the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]]. In 588 AD, [[Pope Gregory I]] deposed Tucillus, ''Miletinae civitatis episcopus'' and the clergy and people of Malta elected his successor Trajan in 599 AD.

Since 1808 all bishops of Malta have been Maltese. As a result of the [[History of Malta#Kingdom of Sicily|Norman]] and Spanish periods, and the rule of the Knights, Malta became the devout Catholic nation that it is today. It is worth noting that the Office of the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisitor of Malta]] had a very long tenure on the island following its establishment in 1530: the last Inquisitor departed from the Islands in 1798, after the Knights capitulated to the forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. During the period of the [[Republic of Venice]], several Maltese families emigrated to [[Corfu]].

Held in St John's Co-Cathedral, Valletta.]]\n\nThe arrival in Malta of [[Caravaggio]], who painted at least seven works during his 15-month stay on these islands, further revolutionised local art. Two of Caravaggio's most notable works, ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist]]'' and ''[[Saint Jerome Writing (Valletta)|Saint Jerome Writing]]'', are on display in the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratory]] of the Conventual Church of St. John. His legacy is evident in the works of local artists Giulio Cassarino (1582\u20131637) and [[Stefano Erardi]] (1630\u20131716). However, the [[Baroque]] movement that followed was destined to have the most enduring impact on Maltese art and architecture. The glorious vault paintings of the celebrated Calabrese artist, [[Mattia Preti]] transformed the severe, Mannerist interior of the Conventual Church St. John into a Baroque masterpiece. Preti spent the last 40 years of his life in Malta, where he created many of his finest works, now on display in the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Valletta]]. During this period, local sculptor [[Melchiorre Caf\u00e0|Melchior Gaf\u00e0]] (1639\u20131667) emerged as one of the top Baroque sculptors of the Roman School.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:'Still Life of Pomegranates, Peaches, Apples and other Fruit' by Francesco Noletti.jpg|thumb|Francesco Noletti's 'Still Life of Pomegranates, Peaches and other Fruits'.]]\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, [[Naples|Neapolitan]] and [[Rococo]] influences emerged in the works of the Italian painters [[Luca Giordano]] (1632\u20131705) and [[Francesco Solimena]] (1657\u20131747), and these developments can be seen in the work of their Maltese contemporaries such as [[Gio Nicola Buhagiar]] (1698\u20131752) and [[Francesco Zahra]] (1710\u20131773). The Rococo movement was greatly enhanced by the relocation to Malta of [[Antoine de Favray]] (1706\u20131798), who assumed the position of court painter to Grand Master Pinto in 1744.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-03-26/news/antoine-favray-and-his-works-205443/|title=Antoine Favray And his works - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2020-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619120019/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-03-26/news/antoine-favray-and-his-works-205443|archive-date=19 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Neo-classicism]] made some inroads among local Maltese artists in the late-18th century, but this trend was reversed in the early 19th century, as the local Church authorities&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps in an effort to strengthen Catholic resolve against the perceived threat of Protestantism during the early days of British rule in Malta&nbsp;\u2013 favoured and avidly promoted the religious themes embraced by the [[Nazarene movement]] of artists.

During the reconstruction period that followed the Second World War, the emergence of the \"Modern Art Group\", whose members included Josef Kalleya (1898\u20131998), George Preca (1909\u20131984), Anton Inglott (1915\u20131945), [[Emvin Cremona]] (1919\u20131987), [[Frank Portelli]] (1922\u20132004), [[Antoine Camilleri (artist)|Antoine Camilleri]] (1922\u20132005), [[Gabriel Caruana]] (1929-2018) and [[Esprit Barthet]] (1919\u20131999) greatly enhanced the local art scene. This group of forward-looking artists came together forming an influential pressure group known as the Modern Art Group. Together they forced the Maltese public to take seriously modern aesthetics and succeeded in playing a leading role in the renewal of Maltese art. Most of Malta's modern artists have in fact studied in Art institutions in England, or on the continent, leading to the explosive development of a wide spectrum of views and to a diversity of artistic expression that has remained characteristic of contemporary Maltese art.

This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures.

Pregnant women are encouraged to satisfy their [[food craving|cravings]] for specific foods, out of fear that their unborn child will bear a representational birth mark (Maltese: ''xewqa'', literally \"desire\" or \"craving\"). Maltese and Sicilian women also share certain traditions that are believed to predict the sex of an unborn child, such as the cycle of the moon on the anticipated date of birth, whether the baby is carried \"high\" or \"low\" during pregnancy, and the movement of a wedding ring, dangled on a string above the abdomen (sideways denoting a girl, back and forth denoting a boy).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nTraditionally, Maltese newborns were baptised as promptly as possible, should the child die in infancy without receiving this vital Sacrament; and partly because according to Maltese (and Sicilian) folklore an unbaptised child is not yet a Christian, but \"still a Turk\". Traditional Maltese delicacies served at a baptismal feast include ''biskuttini tal-mag\u0127mudija'' (almond macaroons covered in white or pink icing), ''it-torta tal-marmorata'' (a spicy, heart-shaped tart of chocolate-flavoured almond paste), and a liqueur known as ''ro\u017colin'', made with rose petals, violets and almonds.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nOn a child's first birthday, in a tradition that still survives today, Maltese parents would organise a game known as ''il-qu\u010b\u010bija'', where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child. These may include a hard-boiled egg, a Bible, [[crucifix]] or [[rosary beads]], a book, and so on.

The Maltese word for this custom is ''il-\u0121ilwa''. This custom along with many others has long since disappeared from the islands, in the face of modern practices.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nNew wives would wear the [[g\u0127onnella]], a traditional item of Maltese clothing. However, it is no longer worn in modern Malta. Today's couples are married in churches or chapels in the village or town of their choice. The nuptials are usually followed by a lavish and joyous wedding reception, often including several hundred guests. Occasionally, couples will try to incorporate elements of the traditional Maltese wedding in their celebration. A resurgent interest in the traditional wedding was evident in May 2007, when thousands of Maltese and tourists attended a traditional Maltese wedding in the style of the 16th century, in the village of [[\u017burrieq]]. This included ''il-\u0121ilwa'', which led the bride and groom to a wedding ceremony that took place on the [[parvis]] of St. Andrew's Chapel. The reception that followed featured folklore music (''[[g\u0127ana]]'') and dancing.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:The statue of St. George issuing from the Basilica on the third Sunday of July.jpg|thumb|The statue of St. George at the ''festa'' of [[Victoria, Gozo]]]]\n\nLocal festivals, similar to those in Southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta and Gozo, celebrating weddings, [[Baptism|christenings]] and, most prominently, [[saints]]' days, honouring the patron saint of the local parish. On saints' days, in the morning, the ''festa'' reaches its apex with a [[Mass (liturgy)|High Mass]] featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint. In the evening, then, a [[statue]] of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in respectful prayer. The atmosphere of religious devotion is preceded by several days of celebration and revelry: band marches, [[fireworks]], and late-night parties.\n\n[[Maltese Carnival|Carnival]] (Maltese: ''il-karnival ta' Malta'') has had an important place on the cultural calendar after [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Piero de Ponte]] introduced it to the islands in 1535. It is held during the week leading up to [[Ash Wednesday]], and typically includes masked balls, fancy dress and grotesque mask competitions, lavish late-night parties, a colourful, ticker-tape parade of allegorical [[float (parade)|floats]] presided over by King Carnival (Maltese: ''ir-Re tal-Karnival''), marching bands and costumed revellers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pressreader.com/malta/the-malta-independent-on-sunday/20170312/282226600527054|title=The Malta Independent on Sunday|last=|first=|date=12 March 2017|website=www.pressreader.com|access-date=2019-12-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191219090605/https://www.pressreader.com/malta/the-malta-independent-on-sunday/20170312/282226600527054|archive-date=19 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Malta - ZebbugM - Good Friday 225 ies.jpg|thumb|[[Holy Week procession]] in \u017bebbu\u0121]]\n[[Holy Week in Malta|Holy Week]] (Maltese: ''il-\u0120img\u0127a Mqaddsa'') starts on [[Palm Sunday]] (''\u0126add il-Palm'') and ends on [[Easter Sunday]] (''\u0126add il-G\u0127id'').

Officially, it is a national festival dedicated to the feast of [[Saint]]s [[St. Peter|Peter]] and [[Saul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]. Its roots can be traced back to the pagan [[Roman Republic|Roman]] feast of ''Luminaria'' (literally, \"the illumination\"), when torches and bonfires lit up the early summer night of 29 June.<ref>''Malta Recent Economic and Political Developments Yearbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments'' {{ISBN|978-1-433-06350-3}} p. 41</ref>\n\nA national feast since the rule of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights]], Mnarja is a traditional Maltese festival of food, religion and music. The festivities still commence today with the reading of the ''\"bandu\"'', an official governmental announcement, which has been read on this day in Malta since the 16th century. Originally, Mnarja was celebrated outside St. Paul's Grotto, in the north of Malta. However, by 1613 the focus of the festivities had shifted to the Cathedral of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], in [[Mdina]], and featured torchlight processions, the firing of 100 petards, horseraces, and races for men, boys and slaves. Modern Mnarja festivals take place in and around the woodlands of [[Buskett]], just outside the town of [[Rabat Malta|Rabat]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIt is said that under the Knights, this was the one day in the year when the Maltese were allowed to hunt and eat [[hare|wild rabbit]], which was otherwise reserved for the hunting pleasures of the Knights. The close connection between Mnarja and [[rabbit stew]] (Maltese: ''\"fenkata\"'') remains strong today.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/23890/1/FENKATA.PDF|title=Fenkata: An emblem of Maltese peasant resistance?|last=Cassar|first=Carmel|date=1994|publisher=Ministry for Youth and the Arts|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=18 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218193705/https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/23890/1/FENKATA.PDF|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1854 British governor [[William Reid (British Army officer)|William Reid]] launched an agricultural show at Buskett which is still being held today.

Malta had the second-highest [[voter turnout]] in the world (and the highest for nations without [[mandatory voting]]), based on election turnout in national [[lower house]] elections from 1960 to 1995.<ref>Mark N. Franklin. \"Electoral Participation.\" in ''Controversies in Voting Behavior''</ref> The [[unicameral]] Parliament is made up of the [[President of Malta]] and the [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] ({{lang-mt|Kamra tad-Deputati}}). The President of Malta, a largely ceremonial position, is appointed for a five-year term by a resolution of the House of Representatives carried by a simple majority.  Members of the House of Representatives are elected by direct universal suffrage through [[single transferable vote]] every five years, unless the House is dissolved earlier by the president either on advice of the [[Prime Minister of Malta|prime minister]] or through the adoption of a motion of no confidence carried within the House of Representatives and not overturned within three days. In either of these cases, the president may alternatively choose to invite another Member of Parliament who invariably should command the majority of the House of Representatives to form an alternative government for the remainder of the legislature.\n\nThe House of Representatives is nominally made up of 65 members of parliament whereby 5 members of parliament are elected from each of the thirteen electoral districts. However, where a party wins an absolute majority of votes, but does not have a majority of seats, that party is given additional seats to ensure a parliamentary majority. The 80th article of the [[Constitution of Malta]] provides that the president appoint as prime minister \"... the member of the House of Representatives who, in his judgment, is best able to command the support of a majority of the members of that House\".<ref name=\"constitution\"/>\n\nMaltese politics is a [[two-party system]] dominated by the [[Labour Party (Malta)|Labour Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Laburista}}), a centre-left [[social democracy|social democratic]] party, and the [[Nationalist Party (Malta)|Nationalist Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Nazzjonalista}}), a centre-right [[Christian democracy|Christian democratic]] party. The Labour Party has been the governing party since 2013, and is currently led by Prime Minister [[Robert Abela]], who has been in office since 13 January 2020. The Nationalist Party, with [[Adrian Delia]] as its leader, is currently in opposition. Two parliamentary seats are held by [[independent politician]]s who were formerly with the [[Democratic Party (Malta)|Democratic Party]] ({{lang-mt|Partit Demokratiku}}), a centre-left [[social liberalism|social liberal]] party which had contested under the Nationalist-led [[Forza Nazzjonali]] electoral alliance in 2017.

Councillors are elected every four years through the [[single transferable vote]]. People who are eligible to vote in the election of the Maltese [[House of Representatives of Malta|House of Representatives]] as well as resident [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the EU]] are eligible to vote. Due to system reforms, no elections were held before 2012. Since then, elections have been held every two years for an alternating half of the councils.\n\nLocal councils are responsible for the general upkeep and embellishment of the locality (including repairs to non-arterial roads), allocation of local wardens and refuse collection; they also carry out general administrative duties for the central government such as collection of government rents and funds and answer government-related public inquiries.

It has been a place of pilgrimage since the medieval period.\n\nThe Acts of the [[Council of Chalcedon]] record that in 451 AD a certain Acacius was Bishop of Malta (''Melitenus Episcopus''). It is also known that in 501 AD, a certain Constantinus, ''Episcopus Melitenensis'', was present at the [[Second Council of Constantinople|Fifth Ecumenical Council]]. In 588 AD, [[Pope Gregory I]] deposed Tucillus, ''Miletinae civitatis episcopus'' and the clergy and people of Malta elected his successor Trajan in 599 AD.

Since 1808 all bishops of Malta have been Maltese. As a result of the [[History of Malta#Kingdom of Sicily|Norman]] and Spanish periods, and the rule of the Knights, Malta became the devout Catholic nation that it is today. It is worth noting that the Office of the [[Roman Inquisition|Inquisitor of Malta]] had a very long tenure on the island following its establishment in 1530: the last Inquisitor departed from the Islands in 1798, after the Knights capitulated to the forces of [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. During the period of the [[Republic of Venice]], several Maltese families emigrated to [[Corfu]].

Held in St John's Co-Cathedral, Valletta.]]\n\nThe arrival in Malta of [[Caravaggio]], who painted at least seven works during his 15-month stay on these islands, further revolutionised local art. Two of Caravaggio's most notable works, ''[[The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist (Caravaggio)|The Beheading of Saint John the Baptist]]'' and ''[[Saint Jerome Writing (Valletta)|Saint Jerome Writing]]'', are on display in the [[Oratory (worship)|Oratory]] of the Conventual Church of St. John. His legacy is evident in the works of local artists Giulio Cassarino (1582\u20131637) and [[Stefano Erardi]] (1630\u20131716). However, the [[Baroque]] movement that followed was destined to have the most enduring impact on Maltese art and architecture. The glorious vault paintings of the celebrated Calabrese artist, [[Mattia Preti]] transformed the severe, Mannerist interior of the Conventual Church St. John into a Baroque masterpiece. Preti spent the last 40 years of his life in Malta, where he created many of his finest works, now on display in the Museum of Fine Arts in [[Valletta]]. During this period, local sculptor [[Melchiorre Caf\u00e0|Melchior Gaf\u00e0]] (1639\u20131667) emerged as one of the top Baroque sculptors of the Roman School.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n[[File:'Still Life of Pomegranates, Peaches, Apples and other Fruit' by Francesco Noletti.jpg|thumb|Francesco Noletti's 'Still Life of Pomegranates, Peaches and other Fruits'.]]\n\nDuring the 17th and 18th century, [[Naples|Neapolitan]] and [[Rococo]] influences emerged in the works of the Italian painters [[Luca Giordano]] (1632\u20131705) and [[Francesco Solimena]] (1657\u20131747), and these developments can be seen in the work of their Maltese contemporaries such as [[Gio Nicola Buhagiar]] (1698\u20131752) and [[Francesco Zahra]] (1710\u20131773). The Rococo movement was greatly enhanced by the relocation to Malta of [[Antoine de Favray]] (1706\u20131798), who assumed the position of court painter to Grand Master Pinto in 1744.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-03-26/news/antoine-favray-and-his-works-205443/|title=Antoine Favray And his works - The Malta Independent|website=www.independent.com.mt|access-date=2020-01-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190619120019/http://www.independent.com.mt/articles/2008-03-26/news/antoine-favray-and-his-works-205443|archive-date=19 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n[[Neo-classicism]] made some inroads among local Maltese artists in the late-18th century, but this trend was reversed in the early 19th century, as the local Church authorities&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps in an effort to strengthen Catholic resolve against the perceived threat of Protestantism during the early days of British rule in Malta&nbsp;\u2013 favoured and avidly promoted the religious themes embraced by the [[Nazarene movement]] of artists.

During the reconstruction period that followed the Second World War, the emergence of the \"Modern Art Group\", whose members included Josef Kalleya (1898\u20131998), George Preca (1909\u20131984), Anton Inglott (1915\u20131945), [[Emvin Cremona]] (1919\u20131987), [[Frank Portelli]] (1922\u20132004), [[Antoine Camilleri (artist)|Antoine Camilleri]] (1922\u20132005), [[Gabriel Caruana]] (1929-2018) and [[Esprit Barthet]] (1919\u20131999) greatly enhanced the local art scene. This group of forward-looking artists came together forming an influential pressure group known as the Modern Art Group. Together they forced the Maltese public to take seriously modern aesthetics and succeeded in playing a leading role in the renewal of Maltese art. Most of Malta's modern artists have in fact studied in Art institutions in England, or on the continent, leading to the explosive development of a wide spectrum of views and to a diversity of artistic expression that has remained characteristic of contemporary Maltese art.

This is a belief that Malta shares with many other Mediterranean cultures.

Pregnant women are encouraged to satisfy their [[food craving|cravings]] for specific foods, out of fear that their unborn child will bear a representational birth mark (Maltese: ''xewqa'', literally \"desire\" or \"craving\"). Maltese and Sicilian women also share certain traditions that are believed to predict the sex of an unborn child, such as the cycle of the moon on the anticipated date of birth, whether the baby is carried \"high\" or \"low\" during pregnancy, and the movement of a wedding ring, dangled on a string above the abdomen (sideways denoting a girl, back and forth denoting a boy).{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nTraditionally, Maltese newborns were baptised as promptly as possible, should the child die in infancy without receiving this vital Sacrament; and partly because according to Maltese (and Sicilian) folklore an unbaptised child is not yet a Christian, but \"still a Turk\". Traditional Maltese delicacies served at a baptismal feast include ''biskuttini tal-mag\u0127mudija'' (almond macaroons covered in white or pink icing), ''it-torta tal-marmorata'' (a spicy, heart-shaped tart of chocolate-flavoured almond paste), and a liqueur known as ''ro\u017colin'', made with rose petals, violets and almonds.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nOn a child's first birthday, in a tradition that still survives today, Maltese parents would organise a game known as ''il-qu\u010b\u010bija'', where a variety of symbolic objects would be randomly placed around the seated child. These may include a hard-boiled egg, a Bible, [[crucifix]] or [[rosary beads]], a book, and so on.

The Maltese word for this custom is ''il-\u0121ilwa''. This custom along with many others has long since disappeared from the islands, in the face of modern practices.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nNew wives would wear the [[g\u0127onnella]], a traditional item of Maltese clothing. However, it is no longer worn in modern Malta. Today's couples are married in churches or chapels in the village or town of their choice. The nuptials are usually followed by a lavish and joyous wedding reception, often including several hundred guests. Occasionally, couples will try to incorporate elements of the traditional Maltese wedding in their celebration. A resurgent interest in the traditional wedding was evident in May 2007, when thousands of Maltese and tourists attended a traditional Maltese wedding in the style of the 16th century, in the village of [[\u017burrieq]]. This included ''il-\u0121ilwa'', which led the bride and groom to a wedding ceremony that took place on the [[parvis]] of St. Andrew's Chapel. The reception that followed featured folklore music (''[[g\u0127ana]]'') and dancing.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Festivals===\n[[File:The statue of St. George issuing from the Basilica on the third Sunday of July.jpg|thumb|The statue of St. George at the ''festa'' of [[Victoria, Gozo]]]]\n\nLocal festivals, similar to those in Southern Italy, are commonplace in Malta and Gozo, celebrating weddings, [[Baptism|christenings]] and, most prominently, [[saints]]' days, honouring the patron saint of the local parish. On saints' days, in the morning, the ''festa'' reaches its apex with a [[Mass (liturgy)|High Mass]] featuring a sermon on the life and achievements of the patron saint. In the evening, then, a [[statue]] of the religious patron is taken around the local streets in solemn procession, with the faithful following in respectful prayer. The atmosphere of religious devotion is preceded by several days of celebration and revelry: band marches, [[fireworks]], and late-night parties.\n\n[[Maltese Carnival|Carnival]] (Maltese: ''il-karnival ta' Malta'') has had an important place on the cultural calendar after [[Grand Master (order)|Grand Master]] [[Piero de Ponte]] introduced it to the islands in 1535.

Officially, it is a national festival dedicated to the feast of [[Saint]]s [[St. Peter|Peter]] and [[Saul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]. Its roots can be traced back to the pagan [[Roman Republic|Roman]] feast of ''Luminaria'' (literally, \"the illumination\"), when torches and bonfires lit up the early summer night of 29 June.<ref>''Malta Recent Economic and Political Developments Yearbook Volume 1 Strategic Information and Developments'' {{ISBN|978-1-433-06350-3}} p. 41</ref>\n\nA national feast since the rule of the [[Knights Hospitaller|Knights]], Mnarja is a traditional Maltese festival of food, religion and music. The festivities still commence today with the reading of the ''\"bandu\"'', an official governmental announcement, which has been read on this day in Malta since the 16th century. Originally, Mnarja was celebrated outside St. Paul's Grotto, in the north of Malta. However, by 1613 the focus of the festivities had shifted to the Cathedral of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], in [[Mdina]], and featured torchlight processions, the firing of 100 petards, horseraces, and races for men, boys and slaves. Modern Mnarja festivals take place in and around the woodlands of [[Buskett]], just outside the town of [[Rabat Malta|Rabat]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\nIt is said that under the Knights, this was the one day in the year when the Maltese were allowed to hunt and eat [[hare|wild rabbit]], which was otherwise reserved for the hunting pleasures of the Knights. The close connection between Mnarja and [[rabbit stew]] (Maltese: ''\"fenkata\"'') remains strong today.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/23890/1/FENKATA.PDF|title=Fenkata: An emblem of Maltese peasant resistance?|last=Cassar|first=Carmel|date=1994|publisher=Ministry for Youth and the Arts|isbn=|location=|pages=|access-date=18 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218193705/https://www.um.edu.mt/library/oar/bitstream/123456789/23890/1/FENKATA.PDF|archive-date=18 December 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn 1854 British governor [[William Reid (British Army officer)|William Reid]] launched an agricultural show at Buskett which is still being held today.

The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\n\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\n\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\n\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\n\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\n\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\n\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\n\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\n\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\n\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\n\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs fought for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n=== Current Senior Clubs ===\n\n==== First Grade Clubs ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n!

surrounding [[New South Wales]] towns [[Queanbeyan]], [[Goulburn, New South Wales|Goulburn]] and [[Yass, New South Wales|Yass]]. The competition is run under the auspices of the [[New South Wales Country Rugby League|Country Rugby League]] and players are eligible for selection in the [[Canberra]] Division of the CRL Tier 1 Divisional Championships. The Canberra district competition has an under 19s, reserve and first grade competitions.\n\n==History==\nAfter the establishment of Rugby League in Sydney in 1909, the game slowly made its way south, reaching the Canberra District in the late 1910s. During those years and into the 1920s and 30s Challenge Cup football was the most popular form of competition, with a cup being donated as a prize for a game between 2 teams. The winning team would then have to defend the cup against all challengers. The most notable Challenge Cups in the Canberra region at the time were the Massey and Carr Cups which began in 1930 and 1933 respectively.\n\nThe first organised round robin competition was run in 1928 by Federal Capital Territory and District Rugby League. The winners of inaugural competition were the Acton Rovers and the next four years saw four different winners. The competition ran through until 1937 when interest in League began to dwindle.\n\nThe Group 8 Premiership began in 1932 and was strong enough to continue while interest in the game waned. Teams from Canberra, Yass, Queanbeyan and Goulburn competed for the title of premiers up until 1941, when all League competitions in the region were suspended due to the war. Competition resumed in 1946, with the Massey and Carr Cups only lasting the one season before being retired, while the Group 8 Premiership continued on strongly and was duly supported by ACT District Rugby League who ran a second division competition.\n\nSome of the teams to compete during this period included Captains Flat, Crookwell, Braidwood, Goulburn Workers, Goulburn United, Queanbeyan and Yass in the Group 8 Competition while in the ACTDRL Second Division competition there were teams such as Ainslie, Causeway, Eastlake, Hall, R.A.A.F, R.M.C, South City and West City.\n\nIt was through the Second Division competition that the Molonglo Shield was established, first being played for in 1964 with Harman/NAVY taking out the inaugural title over the Canberra Rovers.\n\nIn 1967 Group 8 joined with part of Group 9 to form Group 8/9 or Zone 2. This was due to a CRL boundaries dispute in the Riverina, and saw Harden, Young and Wyangala Dam join the district competition. The Zone 2 format lasted until 1970 when CRL returned the boundaries in the Riverina to their original positions and Group 8 was restored.\n\nIn 1974 CRL officially recognised the Molonglo Shield as its own competition and gave it a Group number, Group 19. It was at this point in time that both Group 8 and Group 19 were strong enough to run first and second division competitions. The first division clubs ran firsts, reserves and Under 18's while the second division sides ran just one team.\n\nGroup 8 First Division consisted mainly of the teams which play Canberra Raiders Cup today, with the addition of Crookwell and Goulburn United. Group 8 Second Division was primarily for towns from around the Goulburn District including Taralga, Marulan, Bigga and Argyle. Braidwood also fielded a side in the competition.\n\nGroup 19 First Division comprised teams from around Canberra including Kambah, South Woden, Belconnen United and North Canberra. Batemans Bay also competed in Group 19 until 1977. Second Division was much like George Tooke Shield is today, with teams from Harman, Bungendore, Weston Creek and Captains Flat all competing for the title.\n\nIn 1980 Group 19 changed its name to ACTRL while in 1981 Group 8 changed to CDRL. In 1982 CDRL was granted entry into the NSWRL as the Canberra Raiders so the ACTRL took over the running of senior league in the district, combining the two groups to form 3 new competitions. The premier division still played for the Molonglo Shield, while the second division competition was split into North and South according to location within the District. In 1986 the two second division competitions were merged to form the Canberra Cup, which ran through until 1998.\n\nIn the meantime, a move by regional towns saw the establishment of the George Tooke Shield in 1995, which was aimed at clubs that wished to field firsts and under 18s but were not competitive enough for Molonglo Shield. In its first year 5 teams competed: East Canberra, Braidwood, Yass, Crookwell and Goulburn Exchange. While the Under 18s side of the competition only lasted 2 years, the George Tooke Shield has continued to expand, 9 clubs now competing for the title.\n\nIn 1998, after 35 years, the Molonglo Shield was retired and the Canberra Raiders Cup became the prize the first grade clubs fought for over a season. It is still that way today and the Shield still has its place in the game, awarded to the First Grade Minor Premiers.\n\n==Clubs==\n\n=== Current Senior Clubs ===\n\n==== First Grade Clubs ====\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; width:100%\"\n!

The highest point in the territory is Mont Ross on Kerguelen Island at {{convert|1850|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There are very few airstrips on the islands, only existing on islands with weather stations, and the {{convert|1232|km|abbr=on}} of coastline have no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorages.\n[[File:Kerguelen VolcanDuDiable.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kerguelen Islands]] \u2013 The Volcan du Diable]]\n\nThe islands in the Indian Ocean are supplied by the special ship ''[[Marion Dufresne (1995)|Marion Dufresne]]'' sailing out of [[Le Port, R\u00e9union|Le Port]] in [[R\u00e9union Island]]. Terre Ad\u00e9lie is supplied by ''[[L'Astrolabe (2016 icebreaker)|L'Astrolabe]]'' sailing out of [[Hobart]] in [[Tasmania]].\n\nHowever, the territory has a [[merchant marine]] fleet totaling (in 1999) 2,892,911 [[Gross Register Tonnage|GRT]]/{{DWT|5,165,713|metric|disp=long}}, including seven bulk carriers, five cargo ships, ten chemical tankers, nine container ships, six liquefied gas carriers, 24 petroleum tankers, one refrigerated cargo ship, and ten roll-on-roll-off ([[RORO]]) carriers. This fleet is maintained as a subset of the French register that allows French-owned ships to operate under more liberal taxation and manning regulations than permissible under the main French register. This register, however, is to vanish,{{when|date=December 2014}} replaced by the International French Register (''Registre International Fran\u00e7ais'', RIF).\n\n== Flora and fauna ==\n{{See also|List of mammals of French Southern Territories}}\n\n{{Designation list\n| designation1            = WHS\n| designation1_offname    = French Austral Lands and Seas\n| designation1_date       = [[List of World Heritage Sites by year of inscription#2019 (43rd session)|2019]] <small>(43rd [[World Heritage Committee|session]])</small>\n| designation1_type       = \n| designation1_criteria   = {{UNESCO WHS type|(vii), (ix), (x)}}(vii), (ix), (x)\n| Year                    = 2019\n| area                    = 67,296,900 ha\n| buffer_zone             = \n| designation1_number     = [https://whc.unesco.org/en/list/1603/ 1603]\n| designation1_free1name  = State Party\n| designation1_free1value = {{flag|France}}\n| designation1_free2name  = Region\n| designation1_free2value = [[List of World Heritage Sites in Western Europe|Western Europe]]\n| designation2            = Ramsar\n| designation2_offname    = R\u00e9serve Naturelle Nationale des Terres Australes Francaises\n| designation2_date       = 15 September 2008\n| designation2_number     = 1837<ref>{{Cite web|title=R\u00e9serve Naturelle Nationale des Terres Australes Francaises|website=[[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] Sites Information Service|url=https://rsis.ramsar.org/ris/1837|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>}}\n\n== Economy ==\nThe territory's natural resources are limited to fish and crustaceans. Economic activity is limited to servicing [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[geophysics|geophysical]] research stations and French and other fishing fleets.\n\nThe main fish resources are [[Patagonian toothfish]] and [[spiny lobster]]. Both are poached by foreign fleets; because of this, the [[French Navy]], and occasionally other services, patrol the zone and arrest poaching vessels. Such arrests can result in heavy fines and/or the seizure of the ship.\n\nFrance previously sold licenses to foreign fisheries to fish the Patagonian toothfish; because of overfishing, it is now restricted to a small number of fisheries from R\u00e9union Island.\n\nThe territory takes in revenues of about [[euro|\u20ac]]16 million a year.\n\n== Codes ==\nThe French Southern Territories (i.e. the TAAF excluding Ad\u00e9lie Land) have been given the following [[country code|country codes]]: FS ([[List of FIPS country codes|FIPS]]) and [[ISO 3166-2:TF|TF]] ([[ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]]).\n\n== See

The highest point in the territory is Mont Ross on Kerguelen Island at {{convert|1850|m|ft|abbr=on}}. There are very few airstrips on the islands, only existing on islands with weather stations, and the {{convert|1232|km|abbr=on}} of coastline have no ports or harbors, only offshore anchorages.\n[[File:Kerguelen VolcanDuDiable.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kerguelen Islands]] \u2013 The Volcan du Diable]]\n\nThe islands in the Indian Ocean are supplied by the special ship ''[[Marion Dufresne (1995)|Marion Dufresne]]'' sailing out of [[Le Port, R\u00e9union|Le Port]] in [[R\u00e9union Island]].

Economic activity is limited to servicing [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[geophysics|geophysical]] research stations and French and other fishing fleets.\n\nThe main fish resources are [[Patagonian toothfish]] and [[spiny lobster]]. Both are poached by foreign fleets; because of this, the [[French Navy]], and occasionally other services, patrol the zone and arrest poaching vessels.
