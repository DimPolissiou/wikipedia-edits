It stars [[Julia Roberts]], Crystal, [[John Cusack]] and [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]], with [[Hank Azaria]], [[Stanley Tucci]], [[Seth Green]], [[Alan Arkin]] and [[Christopher Walken]] in smaller roles.\n\n==Plot==\nFilm publicist Lee Phillips is tasked with promoting \u201cTime Over Time\u201d, an upcoming movie featuring husband-and-wife stars Gwen Harrison and Eddie Thomas. His job is complicated by the film's eccentric director Hal Weidmann, who refuses to show anyone the film until its premiere at a [[Movie junket|press junket]]. Worse, Gwen and Eddie, once \"America's Sweethearts\", are going through an ugly split. Gwen's affair with co-star Hector Gorgonzolas, who she now lives with, drives Eddie to an emotional breakdown; Eddie's actions lead Gwen to file a restraining order against him, and he moves to a New Age retreat. Lee decides his best chance to promote the film is to convince the press the couple have reunited.\n\nLee enlists the help of Gwen's sister and personal assistant, Kiki, and they persuade Gwen that her tarnished career and public image will benefit if she attends the junket, where she will also be able to serve Eddie divorce papers. Lee bribes Eddie's spiritual guide to convince Eddie he is well enough to attend.\n\nAt the junket, while Eddie and Gwen are at each other's throats, Lee plants stories to convince the press the couple are reconciling. Gwen encourages Kiki to be her go-between with Eddie; as they spend time together, Kiki and Eddie begin to develop feelings for each other. Hector believes the fake stories that Eddie is trying to win back Gwen, and a public confrontation ends with Eddie knocked unconscious. Kiki tends to Eddie, and they have passionate sex. In the morning, Kiki is furious when Eddie drops everything to talk to Gwen and refuses to admit to being in any other relationship. Regretful, Eddie confesses to Lee that he is in love with Kiki and believes he has lost his only chance with her. Feeling remorse for his role in the drama, Lee encourages Eddie to tell Kiki and end his marriage to Gwen. Weidmann arrives by helicopter with the finished film.\n\nThe screening begins, and the press, cast, and crew discover that Weidmann abandoned the script and made a \"reality movie\" instead. The footage, mostly shot with hidden cameras and without the actors' knowledge, shows Gwen as self-centered, conniving and manipulative, while Eddie is a decent man and becomes paranoid as he suspects his wife is having an affair. Gwen is portrayed as the main antagonist with Hector as her lackey. Kiki is presented as an overweight assistant and Eddie's love interest. The cast and crew \u2014 particularly Gwen and the studio's owner, Dave Kingman \u2014 are offended and confront Weidmann. Enraged, Gwen confronts Weidmann for embarrassing her during filming. He announced that he did this as part of his plans to ruin her career after an incident she caused on set when she talked negatively about his previous work. Gwen announces she will sue Weidmann for embarrassing her and invading her privacy, along with Kingman Studios for having not prevented this. Only Eddie is pleased with Weidmann's film, and they agree to work together again. Hector calls out Gwen for demeaning him in the film. Leaf, Weidmann's daughter, comes to Hector's defense and reveals they also had an affair.\n\nHumiliated, Gwen tries to salvage the situation by announcing she is reconciling with Eddie. He asserts he is finally through with her, and declares his love for Kiki, who reciprocates and stands up to Gwen for the first time. She reveals Gwen's dirty secrets and mistreatment of Eddie and herself. Kiki tells Gwen she is tired of putting Gwen's career over her own personal life and is fired. After the junket, Gwen admits to the press that she and Eddie are through, blaming her behavior on medication, tries to claim that she loves Hector and that the things she said in the film were false. However, no one believes a word she says and notices their relationship is disintegrating. Hector embarrasses Gwen in front of the press by telling her off that they're over. As Kiki and Eddie prepare to leave together, Lee tells them that the press\u2019 positive response has forced the studio to release the film. After they leave, Lee is jumped on by Gwen's dog.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Julia Roberts]] as Kathleen \"Kiki\" Harrison\n* [[Billy Crystal]] as Lee Phillips\n* [[Catherine Zeta-Jones]] as Gwen Harrison\n* [[John Cusack]] as Eddie Thomas\n* [[Hank Azaria]] as Hector Gorgonzolas\n* [[Stanley Tucci]] as Dave Kingman\n* [[Christopher Walken]] as Hal Weidmann\n* [[Alan Arkin]] as Wellness guide\n* [[Seth Green]] as Danny Wax\n* Scot Zeller as Davis\n* [[Larry King]] as himself\n* [[Steve Pink]] as Limo driver\n* [[Rainn Wilson]] as Dave O'Hanlon\n* [[Eric Balfour]] as Security guard\n* [[Marty Belafsky]] as Security guard\n* [[Keri Lynn Pratt]] as Leaf Weidmann\n* [[Maria Canals]] as Adinah\n* [[Byron Allen]] as Himself\n* [[Max Charles]] as Security Guard\n{{div col end}}\n\nJulia Roberts' niece, [[Emma Roberts]], makes an uncredited appearance as the young girl in the purple T-shirt.\n\n==Release==\n===Box office===\n''America's Sweethearts'' opened on July 20, 2001 and earned $30,181,877 in its opening weekend, ranking second behind ''[[Jurassic Park III]]'' ($50,771,645).<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2001&wknd=29&p=.htm | title=Weekend Box Office Results for July 20-22, 2001 | work=[[Box Office Mojo]] | publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]] | date=July 23, 2001 | accessdate=July 13, 2015}}</ref> By the end of its run, the film had grossed $93,607,673 in the domestic box office and $44,583,755 overseas for a worldwide total of $138,191,428.

It was directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Johanna Harwood]], based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|similarly named 1957 novel]]. In the film, Bond is sent to assist in the defection of Soviet [[consulate]] clerk [[Tatiana Romanova]] in [[Turkey]], where [[SPECTRE]] plans to avenge Bond's killing of [[Julius No|Dr. No]].\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', [[United Artists]] greenlit a sequel and doubled the budget available for the producers. In addition to filming on location in Turkey, the action scenes were shot at [[Pinewood Studios]], [[Buckinghamshire]], and in [[Scotland]]. Production ran over budget and schedule, and was rushed to finish by its scheduled October 1963 release date.\n\n''From Russia with Love'' was a critical and commercial success. It took in more than $78 million in worldwide box-office receipts, far more than its $2 million budget and more than its predecessor ''Dr. No'', thereby becoming a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] in 1960s cinema.\n\nThis film also marked the debut of [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], a role he would play for 36 years (and seventeen films) until ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' in 1999.\n\n== Plot ==\nSeeking revenge against [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] Agent 007 [[James Bond]] for the death of their agent [[Julius No|Dr. No]] in [[Jamaica]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 1962 film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.}} international criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]] begins training agents to kill him. Irish assassin Donald \"Red\" Grant proves himself by quickly killing a fake Bond with a [[garrote]] concealed in his wristwatch during training.\n\nSPECTRE's chief planner, [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czech]] chess [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] Kronsteen (Number 5), devises a plan to play British and Soviet intelligence against each other to procure a Lektor [[cryptography]] device from the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and lure Bond to his assassination. SPECTRE's chief executive [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|(Number 1)]] puts [[Rosa Klebb]] (Number 3), a former [[SMERSH]] (Soviet counter-intelligence) colonel, in charge of the mission. Klebb chooses Grant to protect Bond until he acquires the Lektor, then eliminate 007 and steal the machine for SPECTRE (to be eventually sold back to its legitimate owner). Klebb also recruits [[Tatiana Romanova]], a cipher clerk at the Soviet consulate in [[Istanbul]], who believes Klebb is still working for SMERSH.\n\nIn [[London]], [[M (James Bond)|M]] informs Bond that Romanova has contacted \"Station T\" in Turkey, offering to defect with a top-secret Lektor on the condition that Bond handle her case personally. M decides the chance of obtaining a Lektor is worth the risk, and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] gives Bond an [[Briefcase|attach\u00e9 case]] with concealed throwing knife, gold sovereigns, a [[tear gas]] booby trap, and an [[ArmaLite AR-7]] sniper rifle.\n\nIn Istanbul, Bond meets station head [[List of James Bond allies#Film allies|Ali Kerim Bey]], tailed by [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] agents working for Russia, who are, in turn, tailed by Grant; he kills one agent and dumps their car outside the Soviet Consulate. The Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a [[limpet mine]], but he is away from his desk with his mistress. He and Bond spy on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope in the aqueducts beneath Istanbul, and learn that Soviet agent Krilencu is responsible for the bombing. Kerim and Bond lay low at a rural [[Romani people|gypsy]] settlement, where Krilencu attacks them with a band of Bulgarians; Bond is saved by a sniper shot from Grant. Bond and Kerim track down Krilencu, and Kerim kills him with Bond's rifle.\n\nBond finds Romanova in his hotel suite and they have sex, neither aware SPECTRE is filming them. Romanova brings the consulate floor plans to the Ayasofya M\u00fczesi, formally the [[Hagia Sophia]], and Grant kills the other Bulgarian to ensure Bond receives them. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim steal the Lektor and escape with Romanova aboard the ''[[Orient Express]]''. Kerim and Bond subdue a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them. Grant kills Kerim and Benz, preventing Bond from rendezvousing with one of Kerim's men.\n\nAt the [[Belgrade]] station, Bond passes word of Kerim Bey's death to his son, and asks for an agent from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Station Y]] to meet him at [[Zagreb]]. Grant kills Nash, sent from Station Y, and poses as the agent. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond, taunting him that Romanova believed she was working for Mother Russia, and reveals his plan to leave the compromising film of Bond and Romanova with a blackmail letter, staging their deaths as a murder-suicide to scandalise the British intelligence community. Bond tricks Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attach\u00e9 case and stabs him with the concealed knife before strangling him with his own garrote, and flees with Romanova in Grant's getaway truck.\n\nNumber 1 confronts Klebb and Kronsteen for their failure. Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny's poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe, while Klebb is given one last chance to acquire the Lektor, which they have arranged to sell back to the Russians.\n\nFollowing Grant's escape route, Bond destroys a SPECTRE helicopter, and he and Romanova steal Grant's boat on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. Pursued by Morzeny's squadron of SPECTRE powerboats, Bond detonates his own powerboat's fuel drums with a [[flare gun]], engulfing the pursuers in a sea of flames.\n\nHe and Romanova reach a hotel in [[Venice]], where they are attacked by Klebb, disguised as a maid. She tries to kick Bond with a poisoned switchblade shoe, but Romanova shoots her. Their mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova depart on a romantic boat ride, and Bond throws Grant's blackmail film into the canal.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent 007.\n* [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz]] as [[List of James Bond allies#Film-specific allies|Ali Kerim Bey]], head of MI6 Station T in Istanbul.\n* [[Lotte Lenya]] as [[Rosa Klebb|Rosa Klebb (SPECTRE No. 3)]], a former [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] colonel-turned-SPECTRE operative.\n* [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Donald \"Red\" Grant, a cunning SPECTRE assassin and one of the principal Bond enemies.\n* [[Daniela Bianchi]] as [[Tatiana Romanova]], a Soviet Consulate clerk and Bond's love interest.

It follows the storyline of the book and film, albeit adding in new scenes, making it more action-oriented. One of the most significant changes to the story is the replacement of the organisation [[SPECTRE]] to OCTOPUS because the name SPECTRE constituted a long-running [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|legal dispute]] over the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' between United Artists/MGM and writer [[Kevin McClory]]. Most of the cast from the film returned in likeness. Connery not only allowed his 1960s likeness as Bond to be used, but the actor, in his 70s, also recorded the character's dialogue, marking a return to the role 22 years after he last played Bond in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. Featuring a [[virtual camera system|third-person]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[deathmatch]] mode, the game depicts several elements of later Bond films, such as the [[Aston Martin DB5]] from ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964) and the rocket belt from ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/james-bond-007-from-russia-with-love/654415p1.html|title=Interview with David Carson|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=29 September 2005|access-date=8 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/fromrussiawithlove/review.html|title=From Russia With Love Review|last=Navarro|first=Alex|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1 November 2005|access-date=8 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324041325/http://www.gamespot.com/from-russia-with-love/reviews/from-russia-with-love-review-6137026/|archivedate=24 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe game was penned by [[Bruce Feirstein]], who had previously worked on the film scripts for ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', and the 2004 video game, ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|Everything or Nothing]]''.

It was directed by [[Terence Young (director)|Terence Young]], produced by [[Albert R. Broccoli]] and [[Harry Saltzman]], and written by [[Richard Maibaum]] and [[Johanna Harwood]], based on [[Ian Fleming]]'s [[From Russia, with Love (novel)|similarly named 1957 novel]]. In the film, Bond is sent to assist in the defection of Soviet [[consulate]] clerk [[Tatiana Romanova]] in [[Turkey]], where [[SPECTRE]] plans to avenge Bond's killing of [[Julius No|Dr. No]].\n\nFollowing the success of ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', [[United Artists]] greenlit a sequel and doubled the budget available for the producers. In addition to filming on location in Turkey, the action scenes were shot at [[Pinewood Studios]], [[Buckinghamshire]], and in [[Scotland]]. Production ran over budget and schedule, and was rushed to finish by its scheduled October 1963 release date.\n\n''From Russia with Love'' was a critical and commercial success. It took in more than $78 million in worldwide box-office receipts, far more than its $2 million budget and more than its predecessor ''Dr. No'', thereby becoming a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] in 1960s cinema.\n\nThis film also marked the debut of [[Desmond Llewelyn]] as [[Q (James Bond)|Q]], a role he would play for 36 years (and seventeen films) until ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'' in 1999.\n\n== Plot ==\nSeeking revenge against [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] Agent 007 [[James Bond]] for the death of their agent [[Julius No|Dr. No]] in [[Jamaica]],{{refn|name=Timeline|group=N|As depicted in the 1962 film ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''.}} international criminal organisation [[SPECTRE]] begins training agents to kill him. Irish assassin Donald \"Red\" Grant proves himself by quickly killing a fake Bond with a [[garrote]] concealed in his wristwatch during training.\n\nSPECTRE's chief planner, [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czech]] chess [[Grandmaster (chess)|grandmaster]] Kronsteen (Number 5), devises a plan to play British and Soviet intelligence against each other to procure a Lektor [[cryptography]] device from the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]] and lure Bond to his assassination. SPECTRE's chief executive [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld|(Number 1)]] puts [[Rosa Klebb]] (Number 3), a former [[SMERSH]] (Soviet counter-intelligence) colonel, in charge of the mission. Klebb chooses Grant to protect Bond until he acquires the Lektor, then eliminate 007 and steal the machine for SPECTRE (to be eventually sold back to its legitimate owner). Klebb also recruits [[Tatiana Romanova]], a cipher clerk at the Soviet consulate in [[Istanbul]], who believes Klebb is still working for SMERSH.\n\nIn [[London]], [[M (James Bond)|M]] informs Bond that Romanova has contacted \"Station T\" in Turkey, offering to defect with a top-secret Lektor on the condition that Bond handle her case personally. M decides the chance of obtaining a Lektor is worth the risk, and [[Q (James Bond)|Q]] gives Bond an [[Briefcase|attach\u00e9 case]] with concealed throwing knife, gold sovereigns, a [[tear gas]] booby trap, and an [[ArmaLite AR-7]] sniper rifle.\n\nIn Istanbul, Bond meets station head [[List of James Bond allies#Film allies|Ali Kerim Bey]], tailed by [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgarian]] agents working for Russia, who are, in turn, tailed by Grant; he kills one agent and dumps their car outside the Soviet Consulate. The Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a [[limpet mine]], but he is away from his desk with his mistress. He and Bond spy on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope in the aqueducts beneath Istanbul, and learn that Soviet agent Krilencu is responsible for the bombing. Kerim and Bond lay low at a rural [[Romani people|gypsy]] settlement, where Krilencu attacks them with a band of Bulgarians; Bond is saved by a sniper shot from Grant. Bond and Kerim track down Krilencu, and Kerim kills him with Bond's rifle.\n\nBond finds Romanova in his hotel suite and they have sex, neither aware SPECTRE is filming them. Romanova brings the consulate floor plans to the Ayasofya M\u00fczesi, formally the [[Hagia Sophia]], and Grant kills the other Bulgarian to ensure Bond receives them. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim steal the Lektor and escape with Romanova aboard the ''[[Orient Express]]''. Kerim and Bond subdue a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them. Grant kills Kerim and Benz, preventing Bond from rendezvousing with one of Kerim's men.\n\nAt the [[Belgrade]] station, Bond passes word of Kerim Bey's death to his son, and asks for an agent from [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Station Y]] to meet him at [[Zagreb]]. Grant kills Nash, sent from Station Y, and poses as the agent. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond, taunting him that Romanova believed she was working for Mother Russia, and reveals his plan to leave the compromising film of Bond and Romanova with a blackmail letter, staging their deaths as a murder-suicide to scandalise the British intelligence community. Bond tricks Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attach\u00e9 case and stabs him with the concealed knife before strangling him with his own garrote, and flees with Romanova in Grant's getaway truck.\n\nNumber 1 confronts Klebb and Kronsteen for their failure. Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny's poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe, while Klebb is given one last chance to acquire the Lektor, which they have arranged to sell back to the Russians.\n\nFollowing Grant's escape route, Bond destroys a SPECTRE helicopter, and he and Romanova steal Grant's boat on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast. Pursued by Morzeny's squadron of SPECTRE powerboats, Bond detonates his own powerboat's fuel drums with a [[flare gun]], engulfing the pursuers in a sea of flames.\n\nHe and Romanova reach a hotel in [[Venice]], where they are attacked by Klebb, disguised as a maid. She tries to kick Bond with a poisoned switchblade shoe, but Romanova shoots her. Their mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova depart on a romantic boat ride, and Bond throws Grant's blackmail film into the canal.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sean Connery]] as [[Portrayal of James Bond in film|James Bond]], [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] agent 007.\n* [[Pedro Armend\u00e1riz]] as [[List of James Bond allies#Film-specific allies|Ali Kerim Bey]], head of MI6 Station T in Istanbul.\n* [[Lotte Lenya]] as [[Rosa Klebb|Rosa Klebb (SPECTRE No. 3)]], a former [[SMERSH (James Bond)|SMERSH]] colonel-turned-SPECTRE operative.\n* [[Robert Shaw (actor)|Robert Shaw]] as Donald \"Red\" Grant, a cunning SPECTRE assassin and one of the principal Bond enemies.\n* [[Daniela Bianchi]] as [[Tatiana Romanova]], a Soviet Consulate clerk and Bond's love interest.

It follows the storyline of the book and film, albeit adding in new scenes, making it more action-oriented. One of the most significant changes to the story is the replacement of the organisation [[SPECTRE]] to OCTOPUS because the name SPECTRE constituted a long-running [[Thunderball (novel)#Controversy|legal dispute]] over the film rights to ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' between United Artists/MGM and writer [[Kevin McClory]]. Most of the cast from the film returned in likeness. Connery not only allowed his 1960s likeness as Bond to be used, but the actor, in his 70s, also recorded the character's dialogue, marking a return to the role 22 years after he last played Bond in ''[[Never Say Never Again]]''. Featuring a [[virtual camera system|third-person]] [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] [[deathmatch]] mode, the game depicts several elements of later Bond films, such as the [[Aston Martin DB5]] from ''[[Goldfinger (film)|Goldfinger]]'' (1964) and the rocket belt from ''[[Thunderball (film)|Thunderball]]'' (1965).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://cube.gamespy.com/gamecube/james-bond-007-from-russia-with-love/654415p1.html|title=Interview with David Carson|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|date=29 September 2005|access-date=8 January 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/xbox/action/fromrussiawithlove/review.html|title=From Russia With Love Review|last=Navarro|first=Alex|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=1 November 2005|access-date=8 February 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130324041325/http://www.gamespot.com/from-russia-with-love/reviews/from-russia-with-love-review-6137026/|archivedate=24 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe game was penned by [[Bruce Feirstein]], who had previously worked on the film scripts for ''[[GoldenEye]]'', ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]'', ''[[The World Is Not Enough]]'', and the 2004 video game, ''[[James Bond 007: Everything or Nothing|Everything or Nothing]]''.

{"title_page": "Mahlo cardinal", "text_new": "'''Mahlo''' is virgin loser.\n\n== Minimal condition sufficient for a Mahlo cardinal ==\n\n* If \u03ba is a limit ''ordinal'' and the set of regular ordinals less than \u03ba is stationary in \u03ba, then \u03ba is weakly Mahlo.\n\nThe main difficulty in proving this is to show that \u03ba is regular.  We will suppose that it is not regular and construct a [[club set]] which gives us a \u03bc such that:  \n:\u03bc = cf(\u03bc) < cf(\u03ba) < \u03bc < \u03ba which is a contradiction.\nIf \u03ba were not regular, then cf(\u03ba) < \u03ba.  We could choose a strictly increasing and continuous cf(\u03ba)-sequence which begins with cf(\u03ba)+1 and has \u03ba as its limit.  The limits of that sequence would be club in \u03ba.  So there must be a regular \u03bc among those limits.  So \u03bc is a limit of an initial subsequence of the cf(\u03ba)-sequence.  Thus its cofinality is less than the cofinality of \u03ba and greater than it at the same time; which is a contradiction.  Thus the assumption that \u03ba is not regular must be false, i.e. \u03ba is regular.\n\nNo stationary set can exist below <math>\\aleph_0</math> with the required property because {2,3,4,...} is club in \u03c9 but contains no regular ordinals; so \u03ba is uncountable.  And it is a regular limit of regular cardinals; so it is weakly inaccessible.  Then one uses the set of uncountable limit cardinals below \u03ba as a club set to show that the stationary set may be assumed to consist of weak inaccessibles.\n\n*If \u03ba is weakly Mahlo and also a strong limit, then \u03ba is Mahlo.\n\n\u03ba is weakly inaccessible and a strong limit, so it is strongly inaccessible.\n\nWe show that the set of uncountable strong limit cardinals below \u03ba is club in \u03ba.  Let \u03bc<sub>0</sub> be the larger of the threshold and \u03c9<sub>1</sub>.  For each finite n, let \u03bc<sub>n+1</sub> = 2<sup>\u03bc<sub>n</sub></sup> which is less than \u03ba because it is a strong limit cardinal.  Then their limit is a strong limit cardinal and is less than \u03ba by its regularity.  The limits of uncountable strong limit cardinals are also uncountable strong limit cardinals.  So the set of them is club in \u03ba.  Intersect that club set with the stationary set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than \u03ba to get a stationary set of strongly inaccessible cardinals less than \u03ba.\n\n== Example: showing that Mahlo cardinals \u03ba are \u03ba-inaccessible (hyper-inaccessible)==\n\nThe term \"hyper-inaccessible\" is ambiguous. In this section, a cardinal \u03ba is called hyper-inaccessible if it is \u03ba-inaccessible (as opposed to the more common meaning of 1-inaccessible).\n\nSuppose \u03ba is Mahlo.  We proceed by transfinite induction on \u03b1 to show that \u03ba is \u03b1-inaccessible for any \u03b1 \u2264 \u03ba.  Since \u03ba is Mahlo, \u03ba is inaccessible; and thus 0-inaccessible, which is the same thing.\n\nIf \u03ba is \u03b1-inaccessible, then there are \u03b2-inaccessibles (for \u03b2 < \u03b1) arbitrarily close to \u03ba.  Consider the set of simultaneous limits of such \u03b2-inaccessibles larger than some threshold but less than \u03ba.  It is unbounded in \u03ba (imagine rotating through \u03b2-inaccessibles for \u03b2 < \u03b1 \u03c9-times choosing a larger cardinal each time, then take the limit which is less than \u03ba by regularity (this is what fails if \u03b1 \u2265 \u03ba)).  It is closed, so it is club in \u03ba.  So, by \u03ba's Mahlo-ness, it contains an inaccessible.  That inaccessible is actually an \u03b1-inaccessible.  So \u03ba is \u03b1+1-inaccessible.\n\nIf \u03bb \u2264 \u03ba is a limit ordinal and \u03ba is \u03b1-inaccessible for all \u03b1 < \u03bb, then every \u03b2 < \u03bb is also less than \u03b1 for some \u03b1 < \u03bb.  So this case is trivial.  In particular, \u03ba is \u03ba-inaccessible and thus [[inaccessible cardinal|hyper-inaccessible]].\n\nTo show that \u03ba is a limit of hyper-inaccessibles and thus 1-hyper-inaccessible, we need to show that the diagonal set of cardinals \u03bc < \u03ba which are \u03b1-inaccessible for every \u03b1 < \u03bc is club in \u03ba.

Then \u03bc has the required property (being a simultaneous limit of \u03b1-inaccessibles for all \u03b1 < \u03bc) and is less than \u03ba by regularity.

However the condition  \"\u03ba is strongly inaccessible\" is sometimes replaced by other conditions, such as \"\u03ba is regular\" or \"\u03ba is weakly inaccessible\" or \"\u03ba is Mahlo\".  We can define \"hyper-Mahlo\", \"\u03b1-hyper-Mahlo\", \"hyper-hyper-Mahlo\", \"weakly \u03b1-Mahlo\", \"weakly hyper-Mahlo\", \"weakly \u03b1-hyper-Mahlo\", and so on, by analogy with the definitions for inaccessibles, so for example a cardinal \u03ba is called hyper-Mahlo if it is \u03ba-Mahlo.\n\nA cardinal \u03ba is '''greatly Mahlo''' or '''\u03ba<sup>+</sup>-Mahlo''' if and only if it is inaccessible and there is a normal (i.e. nontrivial and closed under [[diagonal intersection]]s) \u03ba-complete filter on the power set of \u03ba that is closed under the Mahlo operation, which maps the set of ordinals ''S'' to {\u03b1<math>\\in</math>''S'': \u03b1 has uncountable cofinality and S\u2229\u03b1 is stationary in \u03b1}\n\nThe properties of being inaccessible, Mahlo, weakly Mahlo, \u03b1-Mahlo, greatly Mahlo, etc. are preserved if we replace the universe by an [[inner model]].\n\nEvery [[reflecting cardinal]] has strictly more consistency strength than a greatly Mahlo, but inaccessible reflecting cardinals aren't in general Mahlo -- see https://mathoverflow.net/q/212597\n\n==The Mahlo operation==\n\nIf ''X'' is a class of ordinals, them we can form a new class of ordinals ''M''(''X'') consisting of the ordinals \u03b1 of uncountable cofinality such that \u03b1\u2229''X'' is stationary in \u03b1. This operation ''M'' is called the '''Mahlo operation'''. It can be used to define Mahlo cardinals: for example, if ''X'' is the class of regular cardinals, then ''M''(''X'') is the class of weakly Mahlo cardinals. The condition that \u03b1 has uncountable cofinality ensures that the closed unbounded subsets of \u03b1 are closed under intersection and so form a filter; in practice the elements of ''X'' often already have uncountable cofinality in which case this condition is redundant. Some authors add the condition that \u03b1 is in ''X'', which in practice usually makes little difference as it is often automatically satisfied.\n\nFor a fixed regular uncountable cardinal \u03ba, the Mahlo operation induces an operation on the Boolean algebra of all subsets of \u03ba modulo the non-stationary ideal.\n\nThe Mahlo operation can be iterated transfinitely as follows:\n*''M''<sup>0</sup>(''X'') = ''X''\n*''M''<sup>\u03b1+1</sup>(''X'') = ''M''(''M''<sup>\u03b1</sup>(''X''))\n*If \u03b1 is a limit ordinal then ''M''<sup>\u03b1</sup>(''X'') is the intersection of ''M''<sup>\u03b2</sup>(''X'') for \u03b2<\u03b1\n\nThese iterated Mahlo operations produce the classes of \u03b1-Mahlo cardinals starting with the class of strongly inaccessible cardinals.\n\nIt is also possible to diagonalize this process by defining\n*''M''<sup>\u0394</sup>(''X'') is the set of ordinals \u03b1 that are in ''M''<sup>\u03b2</sup>(''X'') for \u03b2<\u03b1.\nAnd of course this diagonalization process can be iterated too.

Mahlo cardinals were first described by {{harvs|txt|authorlink= Paul Mahlo|first=Paul|last=Mahlo|year1=1911|year2=1912|year3=1913}}.  As with all large cardinals,  none of these varieties of Mahlo cardinals can be proved to exist by [[ZFC]] (assuming ZFC is consistent).\n\nA [[cardinal number]] <math>\\kappa</math> is called ''strongly Mahlo'' if <math>\\kappa</math> is [[inaccessible cardinal|strongly inaccessible]] and the [[Set (mathematics)|set]] <math>U = \\{\\lambda<\\kappa \\mid \\lambda\\text{ is strongly inaccessible}\\}</math> is [[stationary set#Classical notion|stationary]] in \u03ba.\n\nA cardinal <math>\\kappa</math> is called ''weakly Mahlo'' if  <math>\\kappa</math> is weakly inaccessible and the set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than <math>\\kappa</math> is stationary in <math>\\kappa</math>.\n\nThe term \"Mahlo cardinal\" now usually means \"strongly Mahlo cardinal\", though the cardinals originally considered by Mahlo were weakly Mahlo cardinals.\n\n== Minimal condition sufficient for a Mahlo cardinal ==\n\n* If \u03ba is a limit ''ordinal'' and the set of regular ordinals less than \u03ba is stationary in \u03ba, then \u03ba is weakly Mahlo.\n\nThe main difficulty in proving this is to show that \u03ba is regular.  We will suppose that it is not regular and construct a [[club set]] which gives us a \u03bc such that:  \n:\u03bc = cf(\u03bc) < cf(\u03ba) < \u03bc < \u03ba which is a contradiction.\nIf \u03ba were not regular, then cf(\u03ba) < \u03ba.  We could choose a strictly increasing and continuous cf(\u03ba)-sequence which begins with cf(\u03ba)+1 and has \u03ba as its limit.  The limits of that sequence would be club in \u03ba.  So there must be a regular \u03bc among those limits.  So \u03bc is a limit of an initial subsequence of the cf(\u03ba)-sequence.  Thus its cofinality is less than the cofinality of \u03ba and greater than it at the same time; which is a contradiction.  Thus the assumption that \u03ba is not regular must be false, i.e. \u03ba is regular.\n\nNo stationary set can exist below <math>\\aleph_0</math> with the required property because {2,3,4,...} is club in \u03c9 but contains no regular ordinals; so \u03ba is uncountable.  And it is a regular limit of regular cardinals; so it is weakly inaccessible.  Then one uses the set of uncountable limit cardinals below \u03ba as a club set to show that the stationary set may be assumed to consist of weak inaccessibles.\n\n*If \u03ba is weakly Mahlo and also a strong limit, then \u03ba is Mahlo.\n\n\u03ba is weakly inaccessible and a strong limit, so it is strongly inaccessible.\n\nWe show that the set of uncountable strong limit cardinals below \u03ba is club in \u03ba.  Let \u03bc<sub>0</sub> be the larger of the threshold and \u03c9<sub>1</sub>.  For each finite n, let \u03bc<sub>n+1</sub> = 2<sup>\u03bc<sub>n</sub></sup> which is less than \u03ba because it is a strong limit cardinal.  Then their limit is a strong limit cardinal and is less than \u03ba by its regularity.  The limits of uncountable strong limit cardinals are also uncountable strong limit cardinals.  So the set of them is club in \u03ba.  Intersect that club set with the stationary set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than \u03ba to get a stationary set of strongly inaccessible cardinals less than \u03ba.\n\n== Example: showing that Mahlo cardinals \u03ba are \u03ba-inaccessible (hyper-inaccessible)==\n\nThe term \"hyper-inaccessible\" is ambiguous. In this section, a cardinal \u03ba is called hyper-inaccessible if it is \u03ba-inaccessible (as opposed to the more common meaning of 1-inaccessible).\n\nSuppose \u03ba is Mahlo.  We proceed by transfinite induction on \u03b1 to show that \u03ba is \u03b1-inaccessible for any \u03b1 \u2264 \u03ba.  Since \u03ba is Mahlo, \u03ba is inaccessible; and thus 0-inaccessible, which is the same thing.\n\nIf \u03ba is \u03b1-inaccessible, then there are \u03b2-inaccessibles (for \u03b2 < \u03b1) arbitrarily close to \u03ba.  Consider the set of simultaneous limits of such \u03b2-inaccessibles larger than some threshold but less than \u03ba.  It is unbounded in \u03ba (imagine rotating through \u03b2-inaccessibles for \u03b2 < \u03b1 \u03c9-times choosing a larger cardinal each time, then take the limit which is less than \u03ba by regularity (this is what fails if \u03b1 \u2265 \u03ba)).  It is closed, so it is club in \u03ba.  So, by \u03ba's Mahlo-ness, it contains an inaccessible.  That inaccessible is actually an \u03b1-inaccessible.  So \u03ba is \u03b1+1-inaccessible.\n\nIf \u03bb \u2264 \u03ba is a limit ordinal and \u03ba is \u03b1-inaccessible for all \u03b1 < \u03bb, then every \u03b2 < \u03bb is also less than \u03b1 for some \u03b1 < \u03bb.  So this case is trivial.  In particular, \u03ba is \u03ba-inaccessible and thus [[inaccessible cardinal|hyper-inaccessible]].\n\nTo show that \u03ba is a limit of hyper-inaccessibles and thus 1-hyper-inaccessible, we need to show that the diagonal set of cardinals \u03bc < \u03ba which are \u03b1-inaccessible for every \u03b1 < \u03bc is club in \u03ba.  Choose a 0-inaccessible above the threshold, call it \u03b1<sub>0</sub>.  Then pick an \u03b1<sub>0</sub>-inaccessible, call it \u03b1<sub>1</sub>.  Keep repeating this and taking limits at limits until you reach a fixed point, call it \u03bc.  Then \u03bc has the required property (being a simultaneous limit of \u03b1-inaccessibles for all \u03b1 < \u03bc) and is less than \u03ba by regularity.  Limits of such cardinals also have the property, so the set of them is club in \u03ba.  By Mahlo-ness of \u03ba, there is an inaccessible in this set and it is hyper-inaccessible.  So \u03ba is 1-hyper-inaccessible.  We can intersect this same club set with the stationary set less than \u03ba to get a stationary set of hyper-inaccessibles less than \u03ba.\n\nThe rest of the proof that \u03ba is \u03b1-hyper-inaccessible mimics the proof that it is \u03b1-inaccessible.  So \u03ba is hyper-hyper-inaccessible, etc..\n\n== \u03b1-Mahlo, hyper-Mahlo and greatly Mahlo cardinals ==\n\nThe term \u03b1-Mahlo is ambiguous and different authors give inequivalent definitions.

Roz's son Tom and Lil's son Ian, who are both 18, are also best friends, and the four of them spend all their time together.\n\nRoz's husband Harold is offered a job in Sydney, and goes there to make arrangements, even though Roz does not want to move. That night, Ian kisses Roz, and although she is hesitant the two of them end up having sex. Tom witnesses Roz coming out of Ian's room. Confused and frustrated, Tom tries to seduce Lil, who pushes him away, and tells her what he witnessed. That night, he stays at her house again, and they have sex.\n\nRoz goes to Lil's work and they discuss what happened with their sons. They agree that they both crossed the line, and that it should never happen again. They get together with both of the boys and tell them that these things need to end. Ian still has feelings for Roz, and eventually, they renew the relationship; they then learn that Lil and Tom never stopped sleeping together. Both Roz and Lil admit that they're happy, and they agree to keep going. When Harold returns, Roz tells him that neither she nor Tom can move with him to Sydney.\n\nTwo years later, Roz and Harold are divorced, and Roz and Lil have continued their secret affairs. Ian now works with his mother for a successful yacht-building company, and Tom is studying theater. Harold invites Tom to Sydney to direct one of their plays and Tom accepts, staying with Harold and his new family. While in Sydney, he meets Mary, who is auditioning for the lead role. The two begin a relationship, and Lil reluctantly accepts that he has moved on. Roz and Ian are still together, although Roz knows that he will not be attracted to her for much longer. Finally, the mothers agree to end their affairs with the boys. Ian is upset, and storms out.\n\nSome time later, Tom marries Mary. Ian meets a girl at the wedding, Hannah, and decides to have sex with her to get back at Roz. That night, he comes to Roz' door and begs to be let in, but Roz turns him down, crying quietly in her room. Ian goes surfing but suffers a broken leg in the process. He refuses to see Roz, but Hannah comes to visit him and nurses him through his physical therapy. They begin a relationship, but when Ian and Tom meet up for lunch, Ian mentions that it is going nowhere, and that he'll have to break it off. One day, Hannah shows up at Ian's work and tells him that she is pregnant.\n\nYears pass, and now Ian and Tom are both married, and they both have daughters, Shirley and Alice. Mary and Hannah, Tom and Ian's wives respectively, are ignorant of the affairs. They all spend a day together at the beach, and while most are in the water, Ian and Roz share a quiet moment. That night, they all eat dinner together, during which Tom gets drunk and takes a walk to clear his head. Ian follows him and sees him having sex with Lil. Enraged, he tells Mary the truth. The wives are horrified, and leave with the children.\n\nWhen Tom returns later, he finds Roz sitting alone in her room, and she tells Tom that she doesn't think that Mary, Hannah, or their granddaughters will ever return. Lil tearfully insists that she and Tom tried to stop, but could not keep away from each other. Roz has no words for Lil.\n\nTime passes, and Ian goes for a swim in the ocean until he comes to a free-floating dock in the water, the same dock where he first began his flirtation with Roz, and Roz and Lil used to swim to as girls. He climbs on board and sees that Tom, Lil, and Roz are there. After telling them good morning, he lies down beside Roz.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Naomi Watts]] as Lil\n* [[Robin Wright]] as Roz\n* [[Ben Mendelsohn]] as Harold\n* [[Xavier Samuel]] as Ian\n* [[James Frecheville]] as Tom\n* [[Jessica Tovey]] as Mary\n* [[Sophie Lowe]] as Hannah\n* [[Gary Sweet]] as Saul\n\n==Reception==\n===Critical response===\nThe film has received mostly negative reviews.

Roz's son Tom and Lil's son Ian, who are both 18, are also best friends, and the four of them spend all their time together.\n\nRoz\u2019s husband Harold is offered a job in Sydney, and goes there to make arrangements, even though Roz does not want to move. That night, Ian kisses Roz, and although she is hesitant the two of them end up having sex. Tom witnesses Roz coming out of Ian's room. Confused and frustrated, Tom tries to seduce Lil, who pushes him away, and tells her what he witnessed. That night, he stays at her house again, and they have sex.\n\nRoz goes to Lil's work and they discuss what happened with their sons. They agree that they both crossed the line, and that it should never happen again. They get together with both of the boys and tell them that these things need to end. Ian still has feelings for Roz, and eventually, they renew the relationship; they then learn that Lil and Tom never stopped sleeping together. Both Roz and Lil admit that they're happy, and they agree to keep going. When Harold returns, Roz tells him that neither she nor Tom can move with him to Sydney.\n\nTwo years later, Roz and Harold are divorced, and Roz and Lil have continued their secret affairs. Ian now works with his mother for a successful yacht-building company, and Tom is studying theater. Harold invites Tom to Sydney to direct one of their plays and Tom accepts, staying with Harold and his new family. While in Sydney, he meets Mary, who is auditioning for the lead role. The two begin a relationship, and Lil reluctantly accepts that he has moved on. Roz and Ian are still together, although Roz knows that he will not be attracted to her for much longer. Finally, the mothers agree to end their affairs with the boys. Ian is upset, and storms out.\n\nSome time later, Tom marries Mary. Ian meets a girl at the wedding, Hannah, and decides to have sex with her to get back at Roz. That night, he comes to Roz' door and begs to be let in, but Roz turns him down, crying quietly in her room. Ian goes surfing but suffers a broken leg in the process. He refuses to see Roz, but Hannah comes to visit him and nurses him through his physical therapy. They begin a relationship, but when Ian and Tom meet up for lunch, Ian mentions that it is going nowhere, and that he'll have to break it off. One day, Hannah shows up at Ian's work and tells him that she is pregnant.\n\nYears pass, and now Ian and Tom are both married, and they both have daughters, Shirley and Alice. Mary and Hannah, Tom and Ian's wives respectively, are ignorant of the affairs. They all spend a day together at the beach, and while most are in the water, Ian and Roz share a quiet moment.
