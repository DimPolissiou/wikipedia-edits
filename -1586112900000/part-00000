He became a first-team regular for the [[Premier League]] side, totalling 200 appearances across all competitions. He was loaned to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 2013 and released in 2015, after which he joined [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]].\nDespite being born in France, Assou-Ekotto represented [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] at international level, participating in two [[FIFA World Cup]] tournaments.\n\n==Club career==\n===Lens===\nAt the age of ten, Assou-Ekotto followed his brother in signing for [[RC Lens|Lens]], before making his [[Ligue 1]] debut on 28 March 2004 against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], which Lens won the match 1\u20130. He played in 66 matches in Ligue 1 for Lens. He then played in seven of eight [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] matches as Lens fell to [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] in the round of 32. After breaking into the first-team with three appearances in [[2003\u201304 Ligue 1|2003\u201304]], Assou-Ekotto caught the eye with 29 starts in 2004\u201305. At the start of the 2005\u201306 season, he played in all of Lens' matches in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], as they won that tournament and secured a place in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|that season]]'s UEFA Cup. In the [[2005\u201306 Ligue 1|2005\u201306 season]], he was an almost ever-present for Lens in the league missing just four of 38 league matches as his team finished fourth and again qualified for the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]]. Assou-Ekotto's outstanding performances throughout the season led to him being praised as one of the best left-backs in the country.\n\n===Tottenham Hotspur===\nIn the summer of 2006, Assou-Ekotto moved to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for an undisclosed fee, though estimated to be in the region of \u00a33.5&nbsp;million by the media. Manager [[Martin Jol]] and club sporting director [[Damien Comolli]] described him as one of the brightest prospects in French football at that time. Assou-Ekotto was expected to provide competition with South Korean [[Lee Young-pyo]] at the [[Defender (association football)#Full back|left-back]] position, but his performances in pre-season secured him a place in the starting line-up ahead of Lee. Assou-Ekotto made his full debut in a 2\u20130 defeat at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C|Bolton Wanderers]] on the opening day of the [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League]] season and looked to have unseated Lee until he picked up a knee injury in December. He then appeared to have lost his place to Lee and played just two matches throughout the entire [[2007\u201308 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2007\u201308 season]].\n\nWhen he first arrived in England, Assou-Ekotto spoke little [[English language|English]] and he initially struggled at Tottenham. Assou-Ekotto has since argued that his injury changed his attitude to football because he realised that it could have ended his career:\n<blockquote>When your surgeon tells you maybe you won't play football anymore many things are different in your mind. Before, when you're injured, your money comes into your account every month and everything is cool. But when they speak to you about the end of your career at 22 or 23\u2026 it's why maybe I changed. I'm safe now but this gave me a lesson. That's why I changed many things in my mind and in my life.<ref name=Mann>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/9402117.stm |title=Tottenham defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto keeps it real |first=Leon |last=Mann |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Assou-Ekotto, Song et Gallas.jpg|thumb|left|Assou-Ekotto exchanging shirts with compatriot [[Alex Song]] after a [[North London derby]] in March 2012]]\nAt the start of the [[2008\u201309 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2008\u201309 season]], Tottenham made its worst ever start to a campaign since 1912, losing six and drawing two of their opening eight [[2008\u201309 Premier League|Premier League]] matches.

He became a first-team regular for the [[Premier League]] side, totalling 200 appearances across all competitions. He was loaned to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 2013 and released in 2015, after which he joined [[AS Saint-\u00c9tienne|Saint-\u00c9tienne]].\nDespite being born in France, Assou-Ekotto represented [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] at international level, participating in two [[FIFA World Cup]] tournaments.\n\n==Club career==\n===Lens===\nAt the age of ten, Assou-Ekotto followed his brother in signing for [[RC Lens|Lens]], before making his [[Ligue 1]] debut on 28 March 2004 against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], which Lens won the match 1\u20130. He played in 66 matches in Ligue 1 for Lens. He then played in seven of eight [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] matches as Lens fell to [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] in the round of 32. After breaking into the first-team with three appearances in [[2003\u201304 Ligue 1|2003\u201304]], Assou-Ekotto caught the eye with 29 starts in 2004\u201305. At the start of the 2005\u201306 season, he played in all of Lens' matches in the [[UEFA Intertoto Cup]], as they won that tournament and secured a place in [[2005\u201306 UEFA Cup|that season]]'s UEFA Cup. In the [[2005\u201306 Ligue 1|2005\u201306 season]], he was an almost ever-present for Lens in the league missing just four of 38 league matches as his team finished fourth and again qualified for the [[2006\u201307 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]]. Assou-Ekotto's outstanding performances throughout the season led to him being praised as one of the best left-backs in the country.\n\n===Tottenham Hotspur===\nIn the summer of 2006, Assou-Ekotto moved to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for an undisclosed fee, though estimated to be in the region of \u00a33.5&nbsp;million by the media. Manager [[Martin Jol]] and club sporting director [[Damien Comolli]] described him as one of the brightest prospects in French football at that time. Assou-Ekotto was expected to provide competition with South Korean [[Lee Young-pyo]] at the [[Defender (association football)#Full back|left-back]] position, but his performances in pre-season secured him a place in the starting line-up ahead of Lee. Assou-Ekotto made his full debut in a 2\u20130 defeat at [[Bolton Wanderers F.C|Bolton Wanderers]] on the opening day of the [[2006\u201307 FA Premier League]] season and looked to have unseated Lee until he picked up a knee injury in December. He then appeared to have lost his place to Lee and played just two matches throughout the entire [[2007\u201308 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2007\u201308 season]].\n\nWhen he first arrived in England, Assou-Ekotto spoke little [[English language|English]] and he initially struggled at Tottenham. Assou-Ekotto has since argued that his injury changed his attitude to football because he realised that it could have ended his career:\n<blockquote>When your surgeon tells you maybe you won't play football anymore many things are different in your mind. Before, when you're injured, your money comes into your account every month and everything is cool. But when they speak to you about the end of your career at 22 or 23\u2026 it's why maybe I changed. I'm safe now but this gave me a lesson. That's why I changed many things in my mind and in my life.<ref name=Mann>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/t/tottenham_hotspur/9402117.stm |title=Tottenham defender Benoit Assou-Ekotto keeps it real |first=Leon |last=Mann |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=26 February 2011}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n[[File:Assou-Ekotto, Song et Gallas.jpg|thumb|left|Assou-Ekotto exchanging shirts with compatriot [[Alex Song]] after a [[North London derby]] in March 2012]]\nAt the start of the [[2008\u201309 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2008\u201309 season]], Tottenham made its worst ever start to a campaign since 1912, losing six and drawing two of their opening eight [[2008\u201309 Premier League|Premier League]] matches.

He was, alongside [[Cadmus]] and [[Bellerophon]], the greatest [[Greek hero]] and slayer of monsters before the days of [[Heracles]].<ref>[[Karl Kerenyi|Kerenyi, Karl]], 1959. ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (London: Thames and Hudson) p. 75.</ref> He beheaded the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]] for [[Polydectes]] and saved [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. He was the son of [Poseidon] and the mortal [[Sally Jackson]], as well as the half-brother and great-Uncle of Heracles.\n\n==Etymology==\nBecause of the obscurity of the name \"Perseus\" and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus' native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. In that regard [[Robert Graves]] has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''p\u00e9rthein'', \"to waste, ravage, sack, destroy\") some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to [[Carl Darling Buck]] (''Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin''), the ''\u2013eus'' suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the [[aorist]] stem, ''pers-''. ''Pers-eus'' therefore is a \"sacker of cities\", that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.\n\nThe further origin of ''perth-'' is more obscure. J. B. Hofmann lists the possible root as ''*bher-'', from which Latin ''ferio'', \"strike\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=J. B. |title=Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Griechischen|language=de |location=Munich |publisher=R. Oldenbourg |year=1950 |isbn= }}</ref> This corresponds to [[Julius Pokorny]]\u2019s ''*bher-''(3), \"scrape, cut.\" Ordinarily ''*bh-'' descends to Greek as ''ph-''. This difficulty can be overcome by presuming a dissimilation from the ''\u2013th\u2013'' in ''p\u00e9rthein'', which the Greeks would have preferred from a putative ''*ph\u00e9rthein''. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the ''perse-'' in [[Persephone]], goddess of death. [[John Chadwick]] in the second edition of ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek'' speculates about the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] goddess  ''pe-re-*82'', attested on the [[Pylos|PY]] Tn&nbsp;316 tablet ([[Linear B]]: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc1f\ud800\udc29\ud800\udc5a}}) and tentatively reconstructed as ''*Preswa''.\n\nA Greek folk etymology connected \"Perseus\" to the name of the [[Persian people]], whom they called the ''P\u00e9rsai'' (from [[Old Persian]] ''P\u0101rsa'' \"Persia, a Persian\"). The native name of this people, however, has always had an ''-a-'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Herodotus]]<ref>Herodotus, vii.61.</ref> recounts this story, devising a foreign son, [[Perses_(son_of_Andromeda_and_Perseus)|Perses]], from whom the Persians took the name. Apparently also the Persians<ref>Herodotus vii.150.</ref> knew the story, as [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] tried to use it to bribe the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n===Origin at Argos===\n\nPerseus was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Dana\u00eb]], the daughter of [[Acrisius]], King of [[Argos]]. Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consulted the [[Delphi|oracle at Delphi]], who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son. In order to keep Dana\u00eb childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a bronze chamber, open to the sky, in the courtyard of his palace:<ref>\"Even thus endured Dana\u00eb in her beauty to change the light of day for brass-bound walls; and in that chamber, secret as the grave, she was held close\" ([[Sophocles]], ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''). In post-Renaissance paintings the setting is often a locked tower.</ref> This [[mytheme]] is also connected to [[Ares]], [[Oenopion]], [[Eurystheus]], and others. Zeus came to her in the form of a shower of gold, and impregnated her.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trzaskoma|first=Stephen|title=Anthology of classical myth: primary sources in translation|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis, IN|year=2004|isbn=978-0-87220-721-9|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Soon after, their child was born; Perseus\u2014\"Perseus Eurymedon,<ref>''Eurymedon'': \"far-ruling\"</ref> for his mother gave him this name as well\" (Apollonius of Rhodes, ''[[Argonautica]]'' IV).\n\nFearful for his future, but unwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods by killing the offspring of Zeus and his daughter, Acrisius cast the two into the sea in a wooden chest.<ref>For the familiar motif of the [[Exposed Child]] in the account of [[Moses]] especially, see {{cite journal|last=Childs|first=Brevard S.|authorlink=Brevard S.

Perseus believed Polydectes was less than honourable, and protected his mother from him; then Polydectes plotted to send Perseus away in disgrace. He held a large banquet where each guest was expected to bring a gift.<ref group=\"note\">Such a banquet, to which each guest brings a gift, was an ''eranos''. The name of ''Polydectes'', \"receiver of many\", characterizes his role as intended host but is also a [[euphemism]] for the Lord of the Underworld, as in the [[Homeric Hymn]] to Demeter 9, 17.</ref> Polydectes requested that the guests bring horses, under the pretense that he was collecting contributions for the hand of [[Hippodamia]], daughter of Oinomaos. Perseus had no horse to give, so he asked Polydectes to name the gift; he would not refuse it.

By viewing Medusa's reflection in his polished shield, he safely approached and cut off her head.

The other two Gorgons pursued Perseus,<ref>Pseudo-Apollodorus, ''[[Bibliotheke]]'' 2.  37\u201339.</ref> but, wearing his helm of darkness, he escaped.

On returning to Seriphos and discovering that his mother had to take refuge from the violent advances of Polydectes, Perseus killed him with Medusa's head, and made his brother Dictys, consort of Dana\u00eb, king.\n\n===Oracle fulfilled===\n\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - Perseus.jpeg|thumb|''The Doom Fulfilled'', 1888, [[Southampton City Art Gallery]], part of a series of paintings revolving around Perseus, created by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]]|left]]\n\nPerseus then returned his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a [[votive gift]] to [[Athena]], who set it on [[Zeus]]' shield (which she carried), as the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'' (see also: [[Aegis]]). The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.2 2.16.2]</ref> he did not return to Argos, but went instead to [[Larissa]], where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the [[Quoits|quoit]] and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.\n\n[[File:If looks could kill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Burne-Jones]]: ''The Baleful Head'', 1885, [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]].<br><small>This part of the series plays with the theme of the reflected gaze, as Perseus has Andromeda look at the Gorgon's head, but only as reflected in the well.</small>]]\n\nIn the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'',<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4].</ref> the inevitable occurred by another route: Perseus did return to Argos, but when Acrisius learned of his grandson's approach, mindful of the oracle he went into voluntary exile in [[Pelasgians|Pelasgiotis]] ([[Thessaly]]). There Teutamides, king of [[Larissa]], was holding [[funeral games]] for his father. Competing in the discus throw, Perseus' throw veered - and struck Acrisius, killing him instantly. In a third tradition,<ref>[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], 5.177</ref> Acrisius had been driven into exile by his brother [[Proetus]]. Perseus turned the brother into stone with the Gorgon's head and restored Acrisius to the throne. Then, accused by Acrisius of lying about having slain Medusa, Perseus proves himself by showing Acrisius the Gorgon's head, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nHaving killed Acrisius, Perseus, who was next in line for the throne, gave the kingdom to [[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]] (\"great mourning\"), son of [[Proetus]], and took over Megapenthes' kingdom of [[Tiryns]]. The story is related in Pausanias,<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.3 2.16.3]</ref> who gives as motivation for the swap that Perseus was ashamed to have become king of Argos by inflicting death. In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification. The exchange might well have proved a creative solution to a difficult problem.\n\n===King of Mycenae===\n\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Liberazione di Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Andromeda liberata da Perseo'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]] (c. 1515) \u2013 [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nThe two main sources regarding the legendary life of Perseus\u2014for he was an authentic historical figure to the Greeks\u2014 are Pausanias and the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''. Pausanias<ref>2.15.4, 2.16.3\u20136, 2.18.1</ref> asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae. He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand side of the road from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called ''Persea''. Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring that filled the citadel's underground cistern. He states also that [[Atreus]] stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why [[Heinrich Schliemann]] named the largest [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] tomb the [[Treasury of Atreus]].\n\nApart from these more historical references, the only accounts of him are from folk-etymology: Perseus dropped his cap or found a mushroom (both named ''myces'') at Mycenae, or perhaps the place was named after the lady Mycene, daughter of [[Inachus]], mentioned in a now-fragmentary poem, the ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]''.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''Megalai Ehoiai'' fr. 246.</ref> For whatever reasons, perhaps as outposts, Perseus ''fortified'' Mycenae according to Apollodorus<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4], ''pros-teichisas'', \"walling in\"</ref> along with [[Midea, Greece|Midea]], an action that implies that they both previously existed. It is unlikely, however, that Apollodorus knew who walled in Mycenae; he was only conjecturing. Perseus took up official residence in Mycenae with Andromeda where he had a long, successful reign as king.\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=[[King of Argos]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Acrisius]]\n|\n after=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Tiryns]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Mycenae]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=''none''<br>(founder)\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n==Descendants==\n{{Main|Perseides}}\n\nPerseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]], and two daughters, [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]] and [[Autochthe]]. Perses was left in [[Aethiopia]] and was believed to have been an ancestor of the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. The other descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] got the kingdom. However, the Perseids included the great hero, [[Heracles]], stepson of [[Amphitryon]], son of [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]]. The Heraclides, or descendants of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.\n\nA statement by the Athenian orator, [[Isocrates]]<ref>4.07</ref> helps to date Perseus approximately. He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the legendary succession: Perseus, [[Electryon]], [[Alcmene|Alcmena]], and [[Heracles]], who was a contemporary of [[Eurystheus]]. [[Atreus]] was one generation later, a total of five generations.<!--original research:Taking 1223 as the start of Atreus' reign and assuming an average generation of 25 years brings the date for the start of Perseus' reign to about 1373, which is approximately consistent with the archaeology.\n\nIt would have been Perseus after all who had the Cyclopean wall built ca. 1350. The Egyptian embassy of about 1380 might have been for the purpose of cementing diplomatic relations with the new dynasties in power. It is logical to assume that the first act of the Pelopids when they obtained the throne of Mycenae would be to strengthen the defenses, adding the extension to the north and the secret cistern about 1220.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"10\" |DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA BEFORE THE TIME OF HERACLES TO THE AFTERMATH OF THE TROJAN WAR\n|- href=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\"\n| resource=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\" height width |''Children''\n|[[Perses (son of Perseus)|Perses]]\n| href=\"Southampton City Art Gallery\" |Alcaeus\n| href=\"Pre-Raphaelite\" |[[Sthenelus]]\n| href=\"Edward Burne-Jones\" |[[Heleus]]\n| Mestor\n| href=\"Hippodamia\" |[[Electryon]]\n| href=\"Gorgon\" |[[Cynurus]]\n|[[Gorgophone]]\n| href=\"Ovid\" |[[Autochthe]]\n|-\n|''Grandchildren''\n|''[[Achaemenid]] [[Persians]]''\n|[[Amphitryon]], [[Anaxo (daughter of Alcaeus)|Anaxo]], [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]]\n|[[Eurystheus]], [[Alcyone]], Medusa\n| \u2013\n|Hippothoe\n|[[Alcmene]], Stratobates, Anactor, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, [[Amphimachus of Mycenae|Amphimachus]], Lysinomus, Archelaus, Chirimachus, [[Licymnius]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Aphareus of Messenia|Aphareus]], [[Leucippus of Messenia|Leucippus]], [[Tyndareus]], [[Icarius of Sparta|Icarius]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Third Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|Melas, [[Argius]], [[Oeonus]]\n|[[Admete]], [[Perimedes]], [[Alexander]], Iphimedon, [[Eurybius]], [[Mentor]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Taphius]]\n|[[Heracles]], [[Iphicles]], [[Oeonus]], [[Melas (mythology)|Melas]], [[Argius]],\n| \u2013\n|[[Idas]], [[Lynceus of Messenia|Lynceus]], [[Peisus]]; [[Hilaeira]]; [[Castor and Pollux]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Clytemnestra]], [[Timandra (mythology)|Timandra]], [[Phoebe of Messenia|Phoebe]], Philonoe; [[Penelope]], Perileos, Thoas, Iphthime, Aletes, Imeusimus, Damasippus\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fourth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Iolaus]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Pterelaus (son of Taphius)|Pterelaus]]\n|[[Heracles#Children|Heraclides]], [[Iolaus]]\n|\n|[[Mnesileos]]; [[Anogon]]; [[Cleopatra Alcyone]]; [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]], [[Orestes]], [[Chrysothemis]], Laodice,<ref group=\"note\">Laodice may be the daughter of Agamemnon mentioned by Homer, who is generally equated with [[Electra]].</ref> [[Aletes (son of Aegisthus)|Aletes]], [[Erigone (daughter of Aegisthus)|Erigone]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]; [[Ladocus]]; [[Telemachus]], [[Poliporthes]], [[Acusilaus]], [[Italus]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fifth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Chromius]], Tyrannus, Antiochus, Mestor, Chersidamas, Eueres, Comaetho\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n|\n|Medon, Strophius; [[Tisamenus (son of Orestes)|Tisamenus]], [[Penthilus]]; Persepolis, [[Latinus]], [[Poliporthes]]\n| \u2013\n|}\n\n==On Pegasus==\nThe replacement of [[Bellerophon]] as the tamer and rider of [[Pegasus]] by the more familiar [[culture hero]] Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the [[Renaissance]].

He was, alongside [[Cadmus]] and [[Bellerophon]], the greatest [[Greek hero]] and slayer of monsters before the days of [[Heracles]].<ref>[[Karl Kerenyi|Kerenyi, Karl]], 1959. ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' (London: Thames and Hudson) p. 75.</ref> He beheaded the [[Gorgon]] [[Medusa]] for [[Polydectes]] and saved [[Andromeda (mythology)|Andromeda]] from the sea monster [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]]. He was the son of [[Zeus]] and the mortal [[Dana\u00eb]], as well as the half-brother and great-grandfather of Heracles.\n\n==Etymology==\nBecause of the obscurity of the name \"Perseus\" and the legendary character of its bearer, most etymologists presume that it might be pre-Greek; however, the name of Perseus' native city was Greek and so were the names of his wife and relatives. There is some idea that it descended into Greek from the [[Proto-Indo-European language]]. In that regard [[Robert Graves]] has proposed the only Greek derivation available. Perseus might be from the Greek verb \u03c0\u03ad\u03c1\u03b8\u03b5\u03b9\u03bd (''p\u00e9rthein'', \"to waste, ravage, sack, destroy\") some form of which appears in Homeric epithets. According to [[Carl Darling Buck]] (''Comparative Grammar of Greek and Latin''), the ''\u2013eus'' suffix is typically used to form an agent noun, in this case from the [[aorist]] stem, ''pers-''. ''Pers-eus'' therefore is a \"sacker of cities\", that is, a soldier by occupation, a fitting name for the first Mycenaean warrior.\n\nThe further origin of ''perth-'' is more obscure. J. B. Hofmann lists the possible root as ''*bher-'', from which Latin ''ferio'', \"strike\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Hofmann |first=J. B. |title=Etymologisches W\u00f6rterbuch des Griechischen|language=de |location=Munich |publisher=R. Oldenbourg |year=1950 |isbn= }}</ref> This corresponds to [[Julius Pokorny]]\u2019s ''*bher-''(3), \"scrape, cut.\" Ordinarily ''*bh-'' descends to Greek as ''ph-''. This difficulty can be overcome by presuming a dissimilation from the ''\u2013th\u2013'' in ''p\u00e9rthein'', which the Greeks would have preferred from a putative ''*ph\u00e9rthein''. Graves carries the meaning still further, to the ''perse-'' in [[Persephone]], goddess of death. [[John Chadwick]] in the second edition of ''Documents in Mycenaean Greek'' speculates about the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] goddess  ''pe-re-*82'', attested on the [[Pylos|PY]] Tn&nbsp;316 tablet ([[Linear B]]: {{lang|gmy|\ud800\udc1f\ud800\udc29\ud800\udc5a}}) and tentatively reconstructed as ''*Preswa''.\n\nA Greek folk etymology connected \"Perseus\" to the name of the [[Persian people]], whom they called the ''P\u00e9rsai'' (from [[Old Persian]] ''P\u0101rsa'' \"Persia, a Persian\"). The native name of this people, however, has always had an ''-a-'' in [[Persian language|Persian]]. [[Herodotus]]<ref>Herodotus, vii.61.</ref> recounts this story, devising a foreign son, [[Perses_(son_of_Andromeda_and_Perseus)|Perses]], from whom the Persians took the name. Apparently also the Persians<ref>Herodotus vii.150.</ref> knew the story, as [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] tried to use it to bribe the Argives during his invasion of Greece, but ultimately failed to do so.\n\n== Mythology ==\n\n===Origin at Argos===\n\nPerseus was the son of [[Zeus]] and [[Dana\u00eb]], the daughter of [[Acrisius]], King of [[Argos]]. Disappointed by his lack of luck in having a son, Acrisius consulted the [[Delphi|oracle at Delphi]], who warned him that he would one day be killed by his daughter's son. In order to keep Dana\u00eb childless, Acrisius imprisoned her in a bronze chamber, open to the sky, in the courtyard of his palace:<ref>\"Even thus endured Dana\u00eb in her beauty to change the light of day for brass-bound walls; and in that chamber, secret as the grave, she was held close\" ([[Sophocles]], ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]''). In post-Renaissance paintings the setting is often a locked tower.</ref> This [[mytheme]] is also connected to [[Ares]], [[Oenopion]], [[Eurystheus]], and others. Zeus came to her in the form of a shower of gold, and impregnated her.<ref>{{cite book|last=Trzaskoma|first=Stephen|title=Anthology of classical myth: primary sources in translation|publisher=Hackett|location=Indianapolis, IN|year=2004|isbn=978-0-87220-721-9|display-authors=etal}}</ref> Soon after, their child was born; Perseus\u2014\"Perseus Eurymedon,<ref>''Eurymedon'': \"far-ruling\"</ref> for his mother gave him this name as well\" (Apollonius of Rhodes, ''[[Argonautica]]'' IV).\n\nFearful for his future, but unwilling to provoke the wrath of the gods by killing the offspring of Zeus and his daughter, Acrisius cast the two into the sea in a wooden chest.<ref>For the familiar motif of the [[Exposed Child]] in the account of [[Moses]] especially, see {{cite journal|last=Childs|first=Brevard S.|authorlink=Brevard S.

According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].</ref> After her death she was placed by Athena among the constellations in the northern sky, near Perseus and Cassiopeia.<ref group=\"note\">''[[Catasterismi]]''.</ref> [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times [[Pierre Corneille]]) made the episode of Perseus and Andromeda the subject of tragedies, and its incidents were represented in many ancient works of art.\n\nAs Perseus was flying in his return above the sands of [[Libya (mythology)|Libya]], according to [[Apollonius of Rhodes]],<ref>''[[Argonautica]]'', IV.</ref> the falling drops of Medusa's blood created a race of toxic serpents, one of whom was to kill the Argonaut [[Mopsus]]. On returning to Seriphos and discovering that his mother had to take refuge from the violent advances of Polydectes, Perseus killed him with Medusa's head, and made his brother Dictys, consort of Dana\u00eb, king.\n\n===Oracle fulfilled===\n\n[[File:Edward Burne-Jones - Perseus.jpeg|thumb|''The Doom Fulfilled'', 1888, [[Southampton City Art Gallery]], part of a series of paintings revolving around Perseus, created by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]]|left]]\n\nPerseus then returned his magical loans and gave Medusa's head as a [[votive gift]] to [[Athena]], who set it on [[Zeus]]' shield (which she carried), as the ''[[Gorgoneion]]'' (see also: [[Aegis]]). The fulfillment of the oracle was told several ways, each incorporating the mythic theme of exile. In [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.2 2.16.2]</ref> he did not return to Argos, but went instead to [[Larissa]], where athletic games were being held. He had just invented the [[Quoits|quoit]] and was making a public display of them when Acrisius, who happened to be visiting, stepped into the trajectory of the quoit and was killed: thus the oracle was fulfilled. This is an unusual variant on the story of such a prophecy, as Acrisius' actions did not, in this variant, cause his death.\n\n[[File:If looks could kill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Edward Burne-Jones]]: ''The Baleful Head'', 1885, [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]].<br><small>This part of the series plays with the theme of the reflected gaze, as Perseus has Andromeda look at the Gorgon's head, but only as reflected in the well.</small>]]\n\nIn the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'',<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4].</ref> the inevitable occurred by another route: Perseus did return to Argos, but when Acrisius learned of his grandson's approach, mindful of the oracle he went into voluntary exile in [[Pelasgians|Pelasgiotis]] ([[Thessaly]]). There Teutamides, king of [[Larissa]], was holding [[funeral games]] for his father. Competing in the discus throw, Perseus' throw veered - and struck Acrisius, killing him instantly. In a third tradition,<ref>[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]], 5.177</ref> Acrisius had been driven into exile by his brother [[Proetus]]. Perseus turned the brother into stone with the Gorgon's head and restored Acrisius to the throne. Then, accused by Acrisius of lying about having slain Medusa, Perseus proves himself by showing Acrisius the Gorgon's head, thus fulfilling the prophecy.\n\nHaving killed Acrisius, Perseus, who was next in line for the throne, gave the kingdom to [[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]] (\"great mourning\"), son of [[Proetus]], and took over Megapenthes' kingdom of [[Tiryns]]. The story is related in Pausanias,<ref>Pausanias, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+2.16.3 2.16.3]</ref> who gives as motivation for the swap that Perseus was ashamed to have become king of Argos by inflicting death. In any case, early Greek literature reiterates that manslaughter, even involuntary, requires the exile of the slaughterer, expiation and ritual purification. The exchange might well have proved a creative solution to a difficult problem.\n\n===King of Mycenae===\n\n[[File:Piero di Cosimo - Liberazione di Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|left|300px|''Andromeda liberata da Perseo'' by [[Piero di Cosimo]] (c. 1515) \u2013 [[Uffizi]]]]\n\nThe two main sources regarding the legendary life of Perseus\u2014for he was an authentic historical figure to the Greeks\u2014 are Pausanias and the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]''. Pausanias<ref>2.15.4, 2.16.3\u20136, 2.18.1</ref> asserts that the Greeks believed Perseus founded Mycenae. He mentions the shrine to Perseus that stood on the left-hand side of the road from Mycenae to Argos, and also a sacred fountain at Mycenae called ''Persea''. Located outside the walls, this was perhaps the spring that filled the citadel's underground cistern. He states also that [[Atreus]] stored his treasures in an underground chamber there, which is why [[Heinrich Schliemann]] named the largest [[Beehive tomb|tholos]] tomb the [[Treasury of Atreus]].\n\nApart from these more historical references, the only accounts of him are from folk-etymology: Perseus dropped his cap or found a mushroom (both named ''myces'') at Mycenae, or perhaps the place was named after the lady Mycene, daughter of [[Inachus]], mentioned in a now-fragmentary poem, the ''[[Megalai Ehoiai]]''.<ref>[[Hesiod]], ''Megalai Ehoiai'' fr. 246.</ref> For whatever reasons, perhaps as outposts, Perseus ''fortified'' Mycenae according to Apollodorus<ref>[http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0548.tlg001.perseus-eng1:2.4.4 2.4.4], ''pros-teichisas'', \"walling in\"</ref> along with [[Midea, Greece|Midea]], an action that implies that they both previously existed. It is unlikely, however, that Apollodorus knew who walled in Mycenae; he was only conjecturing. Perseus took up official residence in Mycenae with Andromeda where he had a long, successful reign as king.\n\n{{S-start}}\n{{s-reg}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=[[King of Argos]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Acrisius]]\n|\n after=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Tiryns]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=[[Megapenthes of Argos|Megapenthes]]\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{succession box\n|\n title=King of [[Mycenae]]\n|\n years=\n|\n before=''none''<br>(founder)\n|\nafter= [[Electryon]]\n}}\n{{S-end}}\n\n==Descendants==\n{{Main|Perseides}}\n\nPerseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]], and two daughters, [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]] and [[Autochthe]]. Perses was left in [[Aethiopia]] and was believed to have been an ancestor of the [[Persian Empire|Persians]]. The other descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] got the kingdom. However, the Perseids included the great hero, [[Heracles]], stepson of [[Amphitryon]], son of [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]]. The Heraclides, or descendants of Heracles, successfully contested the rule of the Atreids.\n\nA statement by the Athenian orator, [[Isocrates]]<ref>4.07</ref> helps to date Perseus approximately. He said that Heracles was four generations later than Perseus, which corresponds to the legendary succession: Perseus, [[Electryon]], [[Alcmene|Alcmena]], and [[Heracles]], who was a contemporary of [[Eurystheus]]. [[Atreus]] was one generation later, a total of five generations.<!--original research:Taking 1223 as the start of Atreus' reign and assuming an average generation of 25 years brings the date for the start of Perseus' reign to about 1373, which is approximately consistent with the archaeology.\n\nIt would have been Perseus after all who had the Cyclopean wall built ca. 1350. The Egyptian embassy of about 1380 might have been for the purpose of cementing diplomatic relations with the new dynasties in power. It is logical to assume that the first act of the Pelopids when they obtained the throne of Mycenae would be to strengthen the defenses, adding the extension to the north and the secret cistern about 1220.-->\n{| class=\"wikitable mw-collapsible\"\n! colspan=\"10\" |DESCENDANTS OF PERSEUS AND ANDROMEDA BEFORE THE TIME OF HERACLES TO THE AFTERMATH OF THE TROJAN WAR\n|- href=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\"\n| resource=\"File:Edward Burne-Jones \u2013 Perseus.jpeg\" height width |''Children''\n|[[Perses (son of Perseus)|Perses]]\n| href=\"Southampton City Art Gallery\" |Alcaeus\n| href=\"Pre-Raphaelite\" |[[Sthenelus]]\n| href=\"Edward Burne-Jones\" |[[Heleus]]\n| Mestor\n| href=\"Hippodamia\" |[[Electryon]]\n| href=\"Gorgon\" |[[Cynurus]]\n|[[Gorgophone]]\n| href=\"Ovid\" |[[Autochthe]]\n|-\n|''Grandchildren''\n|''[[Achaemenid]] [[Persians]]''\n|[[Amphitryon]], [[Anaxo (daughter of Alcaeus)|Anaxo]], [[Perimede (mythology)|Perimede]]\n|[[Eurystheus]], [[Alcyone]], Medusa\n| \u2013\n|Hippothoe\n|[[Alcmene]], Stratobates, Anactor, Gorgophonus, Phylonomus, Celaeneus, [[Amphimachus of Mycenae|Amphimachus]], Lysinomus, Archelaus, Chirimachus, [[Licymnius]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Aphareus of Messenia|Aphareus]], [[Leucippus of Messenia|Leucippus]], [[Tyndareus]], [[Icarius of Sparta|Icarius]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Third Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|Melas, [[Argius]], [[Oeonus]]\n|[[Admete]], [[Perimedes]], [[Alexander]], Iphimedon, [[Eurybius]], [[Mentor]]\n| \u2013\n|[[Taphius]]\n|[[Heracles]], [[Iphicles]], [[Oeonus]], [[Melas (mythology)|Melas]], [[Argius]],\n| \u2013\n|[[Idas]], [[Lynceus of Messenia|Lynceus]], [[Peisus]]; [[Hilaeira]]; [[Castor and Pollux]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]], [[Clytemnestra]], [[Timandra (mythology)|Timandra]], [[Phoebe of Messenia|Phoebe]], Philonoe; [[Penelope]], Perileos, Thoas, Iphthime, Aletes, Imeusimus, Damasippus\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fourth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Iolaus]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Pterelaus (son of Taphius)|Pterelaus]]\n|[[Heracles#Children|Heraclides]], [[Iolaus]]\n|\n|[[Mnesileos]]; [[Anogon]]; [[Cleopatra Alcyone]]; [[Iphigenia]], [[Electra]], [[Orestes]], [[Chrysothemis]], Laodice,<ref group=\"note\">Laodice may be the daughter of Agamemnon mentioned by Homer, who is generally equated with [[Electra]].</ref> [[Aletes (son of Aegisthus)|Aletes]], [[Erigone (daughter of Aegisthus)|Erigone]], [[Helen of Troy|Helen]]; [[Ladocus]]; [[Telemachus]], [[Poliporthes]], [[Acusilaus]], [[Italus]]\n| \u2013\n|-\n|''Fifth Generation Descendant''\n| \u2013\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n| \u2013\n| \u2013\n|[[Chromius]], Tyrannus, Antiochus, Mestor, Chersidamas, Eueres, Comaetho\n|[[Leipephilene]]\n|\n|Medon, Strophius; [[Tisamenus (son of Orestes)|Tisamenus]], [[Penthilus]]; Persepolis, [[Latinus]], [[Poliporthes]]\n| \u2013\n|}\n\n==On Pegasus==\nThe replacement of [[Bellerophon]] as the tamer and rider of [[Pegasus]] by the more familiar [[culture hero]] Perseus was not simply an error of painters and poets of the [[Renaissance]].

Kosovo's modern history can be traced to the Ottoman [[Sanjak of Prizren]], of which parts were organised into [[Kosovo Vilayet]] in 1877. In antiquity, [[Dardania (Balkans)|Dardania]] covered the area, which formed part of the larger Roman province of [[Moesia]] in the 1st century AD. In the Middle Ages, the region became part of the [[Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian medieval states]]. It was then conquered by the Ottoman Empire an exact 70 years after the Battle of Kosovo. In 1913 the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] was [[Treaty of London (1913)|incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbia]], which in 1918 formed [[Yugoslavia]].

Dardania's capital was [[Naissus]], previously a Celts settlement.<ref name=\"Naissos\"/> The Roman province of Dardania included eastern parts of modern Kosovo, while its western part belonged to the newly formed Roman province of Prevalitana with its capital Doclea.

Most Balkan cities were sacked by Attila, and recovered only partially if at all.

Numerous churches and monasteries were constructed after the [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianization]] in 864. It remained within the borders of [[Bulgaria]] for 150 years until 1018, when the country was overrun by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] after half-century bitter struggle. According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' of the 10th century Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII]], the Serbian-populated lands lay to the north-west of [[Kosovo]] and the region was Bulgarian.\n\nDuring the [[Bulgarian uprising against the Byzantine Empire (1040-1041)|Uprising of Peter Delyan (1040\u20131041)]], [[Kosovo]] was briefly liberated and during the [[Uprising of Georgi Voiteh]] in 1072, [[Constantine Bodin|Peter III]] was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria in [[Prizren]] from where the Bulgarian army marched to [[Skopje]].\n\nIn the beginning of the 13th century, Kosovo was reincorporated in the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|restored Bulgarian Empire]] but the Bulgarian control faded after the death of Emperor [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] (1218\u20131241).\n\n===Byzantine Period===\nWhen Kosovo was overrun by the Byzantines, the control was subsequently reasserted by Emperor [[Basil II]]. Serbia at that time was not a united state: a number of Serbian principalities lay to the north and west of Kosovo, of which [[Ra\u0161ka (state)|Ra\u0161ka]] and [[Duklja]] were the strongest. In the 1180s, the Serbian ruler [[Stefan Nemanja]] seized control of Duklja and parts of Kosovo. His successor, [[Stefan Prvoven\u010dani]] took control of the rest of Kosovo by 1216, creating a state incorporating most of the area which is now Serbia and [[Montenegro]].\n\n===Serbian Period===\n{{Further|Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian Empire}}\n[[Image:Serbia boundaries CIA.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''\"Kosovo: History of a Balkan Hot Spot\"'']]\n[[File:Car Du\u0161an, Manastir Lesnovo, XIV vek, Makedonija.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Stefan Du\u0161an]] assigned the city of [[Prizren]] as the capital of the [[Serbian Empire]].]]\n\nKosovo was absorbed into the [[Serbia]]n state of Rascia in the late 12th and early 13th centuries,<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'', p.44</ref> and was part of the [[Serbian Empire]] from 1346 to 1371. In 1389, in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] occurred, which ended in a stalemate (both rulers, [[Murad I]] and [[Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107]], were killed).\n\nDuring the rule of the [[Nemanji\u0107]] dynasty (c. 1160\u20131355), many [[Serbian Orthodox]] churches and monasteries were built throughout Serbian territory. From the mid-13th century to the end of the century, the Nemanji\u0107 rulers had their main residences in Kosovo.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of the Balkans'', p.50</ref> Large estates were given to the monasteries in Western Kosovo ([[Metohija]]). The most prominent churches in Kosovo \u2013 the [[Patriarchate]] at [[Pe\u0107]], the church at [[Gra\u010danica, Kosovo|Gra\u010danica]] and the monastery at [[Visoki De\u010dani]] near [[De\u010dani]] \u2013 were all founded during this period.  Kosovo was economically important, as the modern Kosovo capital [[Pri\u0161tina]] was a major trading centre on routes leading to ports on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Also, mining was an important industry in [[Novo Brdo]] and [[Janjevo]] which had its communities of \u00e9migr\u00e9 [[Saxons|Saxon]] miners and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] merchants. In 1450 the mines of Novo Brdo were producing about 6,000&nbsp;kg of silver per year.\n\nThe ethnic composition of Kosovo's population during this period included Serbs, Albanians, and [[Vlachs]] along with a token number of [[Greeks]], [[Croats]], [[Armenians]], Saxons, and [[Bulgarians]], according to Serbian monastic charters or ''chrysobulls''. A majority of the names given in the charters are overwhelmingly Slavic rather than Albanian. This has been interpreted as evidence of an overwhelming Serbian majority. This claim seems to be supported by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] cadastral tax-census ([[defter]]) of 1455 which took into account religion and language and found an overwhelming [[Kosovo population data-points|Serb majority]].

The timing fell perfectly within the Ottoman expansion. The Ottoman Empire took the opportunity of this vacuum to expand its power, just as the Nemanji\u0107s had exploited periods of Byzantine weakness or division in their major expansions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n====Battle of Kosovo====\n\n====First Battle of Kosovo====\n{{See also|Battle of Kosovo}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Kosovo, Adam Stefanovi\u0107, 1870.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389 determined the future of central Balkans and marked the beginning of disintegration of the [[Serbian Empire]]]]\n\nThe [[Battle of Kosovo|First Battle of Kosovo]] occurred on the field of [[Kosovo Polje]] on June 28, 1389, when the ruling ''[[Knez (title)|knez]]'' (prince) of Serbia, [[Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107]], marshalled a coalition of Christian soldiers, made up of Serbs, but in small numbers also of [[Bosnians]], [[Albanians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Magyars]]  and a troop of Saxon mercenaries. [[Sultan]] [[Murad I]] also gathered a coalition of soldiers and volunteers from neighbouring countries in [[Anatolia]] and [[Rumelia]]. Exact numbers are difficult to come by, but most reliable historical accounts suggest that the Christian army was heavily outnumbered by the Ottomans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The combined numbers of the two armies are believed to be less than 100,000.\n\nThe Serbian army was defeated and Lazar was slain, although Murad I was killed, according to tradition by [[Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107]], or Kobili\u0107 as he was always called until the 18th century; he has been variously described as a Serb, an Albanian, and a Hungarian.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp.68\u201374</ref> Although the battle has been mythologised as a great Serbian defeat, at the time opinion was divided as to whether it was a Serbian defeat, a stalemate or possibly even a Serbian victory. Serbian principalities continued their existence, usually as vassals of the Ottomans, and maintained sporadic control of Kosovo, until the final extinction of the Despotate of Serbia in 1459, following which Serbia became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The fortress of Novo Brdo, important at the time due to its rich silver mines, came under siege for forty days by the Ottomans during that year, capitulating and becoming occupied by the Ottomans on June 1, 1455.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp. 81\u201392.</ref>\n\n====Second Battle of Kosovo====\n{{See also|Battle of Kosovo (1448)}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]] was fought over two days in October 1448, between a Hungarian force led by [[John Hunyadi]] and an Ottoman army led by [[Murad II]]. Significantly larger than the first battle, with both armies numbering twice that of the first battle,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} the ending was the same, and the Hungarian army was defeated in the battle and pushed from the field. Although the loss of the battle was a setback for those resisting the Ottoman invasion of Europe at that time, it was not a 'crushing blow to the cause'. Hunyadi was able to maintain Hungarian resistance to the Ottomans during his lifetime.\n\n====Significance====\nThe overall significance of these battles (within their medieval context) remains disputed,<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp 55\u201380</ref> although the First Battle of Kosovo has become, for Serbians since their independence at least, a national symbol for heroism and an admirable 'fight against all odds', and may therefore have assumed a significance that it lacked . It seems unlikely that single battles could seriously have affected the rise of Ottoman power. In the First Battle of Kosovo, Sultan Murat I was the first Ottoman ruler to lose his life in combat; his successor Sultan Bayazid I went on to expand Ottoman territories significantly despite defeats in Wallachia, in his siege of Constantinople, and his crushing defeat in the battle of Ankara, in which he was captured and which resulted in a civil war for the succession. Despite these defeats, Ottoman power continued to expand.\n\nThe Second Battle of Kosovo might have had more significance<ref>Noel Malcolm ''A Short History of Kosovo'', pp. 87\u201391</ref>  in that there were two powers simultaneously resisting the Ottomans (the Hungarians under Hunyadi and the Albanians under Skanderbeg), with Skanderbeg only narrowly missed joining Hunyadi for the battle. While the resistance of the Byzantines, Serbians, Hungarians, Albanians and Wallachians should have given the Austrians (and Italians) more time to prepare for an Ottoman threat against them, it is by no means clear that they believed the threat to be serious or consciously prepared for it.\n\n===Ottoman Period===\n{{Main|History of Ottoman Kosovo}}\n{{See also|Vilayet of Kosovo}}\n{{See also|History of Ottoman Albania}}\n\n{{Main|20th century history of Kosovo}}\n[[Image:Kosovo02.png|thumb|[[Vilayet of Kosovo]], 1875\u20131878.]]\n[[Image:Vilayet of Kosovo (1881\u20131913) map.png|thumb|[[Vilayet of Kosovo]], 1881\u20131912.]]\n[[File:Ernst-Ravenstein-Balkans-Ethnic-Map-1880.jpg|thumb|Ethnographic map of the Balkans in the end of the 19th century.]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam]] with them and later also created the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. Ottoman rule lasted for about 500 years, in which time the Ottomans were the absolute power in the region. Many Slavs converted to Islam and served under Ottomans. Kosovo was taken temporarily by the Austrian forces during the War of 1683\u20131699 with help of Serbs but were defeated and retreated shortly thereafter. In 1690, the [[Serbian Patriarch of Pe\u0107]] [[Arsenije III]], who had previously escaped a certain death, fled to Austria as did 30\u201340,000 people (according to the Patriarch).<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'', p. 161</ref> He was probably referring only to Serbs; numbers of Albanians also fled. Due to the oppression from the Ottomans, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo area continued throughout the 18th century. Most Albanians eventually adopted [[Islam]], while most Serbs did not.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'', pp.104\u2013138</ref>\n\nIn 1766, the Ottomans abolished the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107]] and the position of [[Christians]] in Kosovo was greatly reduced.\n\n==Modern==\nThe territory of today's province was for centuries ruled by the Ottoman Empire. During this period several administrative districts known as [[sanjak]]s (\"banners\" or districts) each ruled by a ''sanjakbey'' (roughly equivalent to \"district lord\") have included parts of the territory as parts of their territories. Despite the imposition of [[Muslim]] rule, large numbers of [[Christians]] continued to live and sometimes even prosper under the Ottomans. A process of [[Islamisation]] began shortly after the beginning of Ottoman rule but it took a considerable amount of time \u2013 at least a century \u2013 and was concentrated at first on the towns. A large part of the reason for the conversion was probably economic and social, as Muslims had considerably more rights and privileges than Christian subjects. Christian religious life nonetheless continued, while churches were largely left alone by the Ottomans, but both the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] churches and their congregations suffered from high levels of taxation.\n\nFrom the 17th century, there is evidence of an increasing proportion of Albanian-speakers in Kosovo, spreading from the West. Some of this seems to have been the result of migration from the mountains of modern Albania into lands which could support higher populations, and that the putative migrants brought Islam with them. Catholic Albanians who found it convenient to be officially Muslim (whatever their origins) were not allowed by the Vatican to continue Catholic rites in private, and therefore became increasingly Islamised.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''Short History of Kosovo'', pp. 114\u2013138</ref>\n\nIn 1689 Kosovo was greatly disrupted in the course of the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683\u20131699), in one of the pivotal events. In October 1689, a small [[Habsburg Monarcy|Habsburg]] force under [[Margrave]] [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Ludwig of Baden]] breached the Ottoman Empire and reached as far as Kosovo, following their earlier capture of [[Belgrade]]. Many Serbs and Albanians pledged their loyalty to the [[Austrians]], some joining Ludwig's army. This was by no means a universal reaction; many other Albanians fought alongside the Ottomans to resist the Austrian advance. A massive Ottoman counter-attack the following summer drove the Austrians back to their fortress at [[Ni\u0161]], then back to Belgrade, then finally back across the [[Danube]] into Austria.\n\nIn 1878, one of the four [[vilayet]]s with Albanian inhabitants that formed the [[League of Prizren]] was [[Vilayet of Kosovo]]. The League's purpose was to resist both Ottoman rule and incursions by the newly emerging Balkan nations.\n\n[[file: Ethnic map of Balkans - german 1882.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Balkans \u2013 Heinrich Kiepert 1882.]]\n\nIn 1910, an Albanian insurrection, which was possibly aided surreptitiously by the [[Young Turks]] to put pressure on the [[Ottoman Porte|Sublime Porte]], broke out in [[Pristina]] and soon spread to the entire vilayet of Kosovo, lasting for three months. The Sultan visited Kosovo in June 1911 during peace settlement talks covering all Albanian-inhabited areas.\n\n===Albanian National Movement===\n{{Main|Albanian National Revival|Expulsion of the Albanians 1877-1878}}\nThe Albanian national movement was inspired by various factors. Besides the National Renaissance that had been promoted by Albanian activists, political reasons were a contributing factor. In the 1870s the Ottoman Empire experienced a tremendous contraction in territory and defeats in wars against the Slavic monarchies of Europe. During and after the [[Serbian\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Serbian\u2013Ottoman War]] of 1876\u201378, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the [[Armed forces of the Principality of Serbia|Serb army]] from the [[Sanjak of Ni\u0161|Sanjak of Ni\u0219]] and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet.<ref>Pllana, Emin (1985). \"Les raisons de la mani\u00e8re de l'exode des refugies albanais du territoire du sandjak de Nish a Kosove (1878\u20131878) [The reasons for the manner of the exodus of Albanian refugees from the territory of the Sanjak of Ni\u0161 to Kosovo (1878\u20131878)] \".

During its three years of existence the League sought the creation of an [[Albanian vilayet]] within the Ottoman Empire, raised an army and fought a defensive war. In 1881 a provisional government was formed to administer Albania under the presidency of [[Ymer Prizreni]], assisted by prominent ministers such as [[Abdyl Frash\u00ebri]] and [[Sulejman Vokshi]].

A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins.<ref>Malcolm, Noel ''Kosovo: A Short History'', p.312</ref> Most sources put the numbers of Serbs killed during WWII in Kosovo at anywhere from 10,000-40,000, with 250,000 forcibly expelled.  \"We should endeavor to ensure that the Serb population of Kosovo should be removed as soon as possible ...

Both Albanian and Yugoslav communists signed the agreement, according to which Kosovo would have the right to democratically decide whether it wants to remain in Albania or become part of Serbia.

When a Serbian farmer, [[Djordje Martinovi\u0107|\u0110or\u0111e Martinovi\u0107]], turned up at a Kosovo hospital with a bottle in his [[rectum]] after being assaulted in his field by masked men, 216 prominent Serbian intellectuals signed a petition declaring that \"the case of \u0110or\u0111e Martinovi\u0107 has come to symbolize the predicament of all Serbs in Kosovo.\"\n\nPerhaps the most politically explosive complaint levelled by the Kosovo Serbs was that they were being neglected by the Communist authorities in Belgrade.<ref name=\"nyt19870627\">New York Times 1987-06-27, \"Belgrade Battles Kosovo Serbs\"</ref> In August 1987, [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], then a rising politician, visited Kosovo. He appealed to Serb nationalism to further his career{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}. Having drawn huge crowds to a rally commemorating the Battle of Kosovo, he pledged to Kosovo Serbs that \"No one should dare to beat you\", and became an instant hero of Kosovo's Serbs. By the end of the year Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was in control of the Serbian government.\n\nThrough 1988 and 1989, dominant forces in Serbian politics engaged in a series of moves that became known as the [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]. The leading politicians of Kosovo and the northern province of [[Vojvodina]] were sacked and replaced, and the level of autonomy of the provinces started to be unilaterally reduced by the Serbian federal authority. In protest, the Kosovo Albanians engaged in mass demonstrations, and Trep\u010da miners [[1989 Kosovo miners' strike|began a hunger strike]].\n\nThe new constitution significantly reduced the provinces' rights, permitting the government of Serbia to exert direct control over many previously autonomous areas of governance. In particular, the constitutional changes handed control of the police, the court system, the economy, the education system and language policies to the Serbian government.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}}\nIt was strongly opposed by many of Serbia's national minorities, who saw it as a means of imposing ethnically based centralised rule on the provinces.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,970851,00.html Yugoslavia The Old Demons Arise], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', August 06, 1990</ref>\n\nThe Albanian representatives in provincial government largely opposed the constitutional changes and abstained from ratification in the Kosovo assembly.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}} In March 1989, preceding a final push for ratification, the Yugoslav police rounded up around 240 prominent Kosovo Albanians, apparently selected based on their anti-ratification sentiment, and detained them with complete disregard for [[due process]].{{sfn|Anderson|1990|pp=27\u201329}} When the assembly met to discuss the proposals, tanks and armoured cars surrounded the meeting place.{{sfn|Judah|2008|p=56}} Though the final vote failed to reach the required two-thirds majority threshold, it was declared as having passed.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}}\n\n===Kosovo War===\n{{Kosovo War}}\nAfter the constitutional changes, the parliaments of all Yugoslavian republics and provinces, which until then had MPs only from the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]], were dissolved and multi-party elections were held for them. Kosovo Albanians refused to participate in the elections and held their own, unsanctioned elections instead. As election laws required  turnout higher than 50%, the parliament of Kosovo could not be established.\n\nThe new constitution abolished the individual provinces' official media, integrating them within the official media of Serbia while still retaining some programs in the [[Albanian language]]. The Albanian-language media in Kosovo was suppressed. Funding was withdrawn from state-owned media, including that in the Albanian language in Kosovo. The constitution made creating privately owned media possible, however their functioning was very difficult because of high rents and restricting laws. State-owned Albanian language television or radio was also banned from broadcasting from Kosovo.<ref>[https://www.hrw.org/worldreport/Helsinki-12.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041027223050/http://www.hrw.org/worldreport/Helsinki-12.htm |date=October 27, 2004 }}</ref>  However, privately owned Albanian media outlets appeared; of these, probably the most famous is \"Koha Ditore\", which was allowed to operate until late 1998 when it was closed after it published a calendar which was claimed to be a glorification of ethnic Albanian separatists.\n\nThe constitution also transferred control over state-owned companies to the Serbian government (at the time, most of the companies were state-owned). In September 1990, up to 12,000 Albanian workers were fired from their positions in government and the media, as were teachers, doctors, and workers in government-controlled industries,<ref>{{cite web|author=Wolfgang Plarre |url=http://www.bndlg.de/~wplarre/back337.htm |title=ON THE RECORD: //Civil Society in Kosovo// \u2013 Volume 9, Issue 1 \u2013 August 30, 1999 \u2013 THE BIRTH AND REBIRTH OF CIVIL SOCIETY IN KOSOVO \u2013 PART ONE: REPRESSION AND RESISTANCE |publisher=Bndlg.de |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>  provoking a [[general strike]] and mass unrest.

The curriculum was basically the same as Serbian and that of all other nationalities in Serbia except that it had education on and in Albanian language. Education in Albanian was withdrawn in 1992 and re-established in 1994.<ref>[http://www.osce.org/kosovo/documents/reports/hr/part1/ch1.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041010143329/http://www.osce.org/kosovo/documents/reports/hr/part1/ch1.htm |date=October 10, 2004 }}</ref> At the Pristina University, which was seen as a centre of Kosovo Albanian cultural identity, education in the Albanian language was abolished and Albanian teachers were also sacked en masse.

Following mass rioting and unrest from Albanians as well as outbreaks of inter-communal violence,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} in February 1990, a state of emergency was declared, and the presence of the Yugoslav Army and police was significantly increased to quell the unrest.\n\nUnsanctioned elections were held in 1992, which overwhelmingly elected [[Ibrahim Rugova]] as \"president\" of a self-declared Republic of Kosovo; however these elections were not recognised by Serbian nor any foreign government. In 1995, thousands of Serb refugees from [[Croatia]] settled in Kosovo, which further worsened relations between the two communities.\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 220\n | image1    = Memorial - Vushtrri.jpg\n | caption1  = Memorial to Albanian victims in [[Vu\u010ditrn]]\n | image2    = Monument to Serbs Killed in Kosovo since 1990s - Mitrovica (Serb Side) - Kosovo.jpg\n | caption2  = Monument to Serbian victims in [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]]\n}}\n\nAlbanian opposition to sovereignty of Yugoslavia and especially Serbia had surfaced in rioting (1968 and March 1981) in the capital [[Pristina]]. Ibrahim Rugova initially advocated non-violent resistance, but later opposition took the form of separatist agitation by opposition political groups and armed action from 1996 by the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA; Alb. ''Ushtria \u00c7lirimtare e Kosov\u00ebs'' or ''U\u00c7K'').\n\nThe KLA launched a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] and [[terrorism|terror campaign]], characterised by regular bomb and gun attacks on Yugoslav security forces, state officials and civilians known to openly support the national government, this included Albanians who were non-sympathizers with KLA motives. In March 1998, Yugoslav army units joined Serbian police to fight the separatists, using military force. In the months that followed, thousands of Albanian civilians were killed and more than 10,000 fled their homes; most of these people were Albanian. Many Albanian families were forced to flee their homes at gunpoint, as a result of fighting between national security and KLA forces leading to expulsions by the security forces including associated paramilitary militias. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) estimated that 460,000 people had been displaced from March 1998 to the start of the NATO bombing campaign in March 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/news/opendoc.htm?tbl=NEWS&page=home&id=3ae6b80dc |title=Kosovo Crisis Update |publisher=UNHCR |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\nThere was violence against non-Albanians as well: UNHCR reported (March 1999) that over 90 mixed villages in Kosovo \"have now been emptied of Serb inhabitants\" and other Serbs continue leaving, either to be displaced in other parts of Kosovo or fleeing into central Serbia. The [[Yugoslav Red Cross]] estimated there were more than 130,000 non-Albanian displaced in need of assistance in Kosovo, most of whom were Serb.<ref>[http://www.refugees.org/news/crisis/kosovo_u0399.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210223223/http://www.refugees.org/news/crisis/kosovo_u0399.htm |date=December 10, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kukes Refugee Camp.jpg|thumb|left|Refugee camp near [[Kuk\u00ebs]], [[Albania]] (1999)]]\nFollowing the breakdown of negotiations between Serbian and Albanian representatives, under [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) auspices, NATO intervened on March 24, 1999 without United Nations authority. NATO launched a campaign of heavy bombing against Yugoslav military targets and then moved to wide range bombings (like bridges in Novi Sad). A full-scale war broke out as KLA continued to attack Serbian forces and Serbian/Yugoslav forces continued to fight KLA amidst a massive displacement of the population of Kosovo, which most human rights groups and international organisations regarded as an act of [[ethnic cleansing]] perpetrated by the government forces. A number of senior Yugoslav government officials and military officers, including President Milo\u0161evi\u0107, were subsequently indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ([[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]]) for [[war crime]]s. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 died in detention before a verdict was rendered.\n\nThe [[United Nations]] estimated that during the Kosovo War, nearly 40,000 Albanians fled or were expelled from Kosovo between March 1998 and the end of April 1999. Most of the refugees went to Albania, the [[Republic of Macedonia]], or [[Montenegro]]. Government security forces confiscated and destroyed the documents and licence plates of many fleeing Albanians in what was widely regarded as an attempt to erase the identities of the refugees, the term \"[[identity cleansing]]\" being coined to denote this action. This made it difficult to distinguish with certainty the identity of returning refugees after the war. Serbian sources claim that many Albanians from Macedonia and Albania \u2013 perhaps as many as 300,000, by some estimates \u2013 have since migrated to Kosovo in the guise of refugees. The entire issue is moot, however, due to the survival of birth and death records.\n\n===Post Kosovo War===\n{{Further|United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|Constitutional status of Kosovo|Kosovo status process|2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Republic of Kosovo}}\n\nThe war ended on June 10, 1999 with the Serbian and Yugoslav governments signing the [[Kumanovo Agreement]] which agreed to transfer governance of the province to the United Nations. A NATO-led Kosovo Force ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) entered the province following the [[Kosovo War]], tasked with providing security to the UN Mission in Kosovo ([[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]). Before and during the handover of power, an estimated 100,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians, mostly Serbs, fled the province for fear of reprisals. In the case of the non-Albanians, the Roma in particular were regarded by many Albanians as having assisted the Serbs during the war. Many left along with the withdrawing Serbian security forces, expressing fears that they would be targeted by returning Albanian refugees and KLA fighters who blamed them for wartime acts of violence. Thousands more were driven out by intimidation, attacks and a wave of crime after the war as KFOR struggled to restore order in the province.\n\nLarge numbers of refugees from Kosovo still live in temporary camps and shelters in Serbia proper. In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro reported hosting 277,000 internally displaced people (the vast majority being Serbs and Roma from Kosovo), which included 201,641 persons displaced from Kosovo into Serbia proper, 29,451 displaced from Kosovo into Montenegro, and about 46,000 displaced within Kosovo itself, including 16,000 returning refugees unable to inhabit their original homes.<ref>[http://www.refugees.org/world/countryrpt/europe/yugoslavia.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029061224/http://www.refugees.org/world/countryrpt/europe/yugoslavia.htm |date=October 29, 2004 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&id=414ad5b57&page=statistics ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613013001/http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&id=414ad5b57&page=statistics |date=June 13, 2011 }}</ref>\nSome sources put the figure far lower; the European Stability Initiative estimates the number of displaced people as being only 65,000, with another 40,000 Serbs remaining in Kosovo, though this would leave a significant proportion of the pre-1999 ethnic Serb population unaccounted-for.

Kosovo's modern history can be traced to the Ottoman [[Sanjak of Prizren]], of which parts were organised into [[Kosovo Vilayet]] in 1877. In antiquity, [[Dardania (Balkans)|Dardania]] covered the area, which formed part of the larger Roman province of [[Moesia]] in the 1st century AD. In the Middle Ages, the region became part of the [[Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Byzantine Empire]] and the [[Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian medieval states]]. It was then conquered by the Ottoman Empire an exact 70 years after the Battle of Kosovo. In 1913 the [[Kosovo Vilayet]] was [[Treaty of London (1913)|incorporated into the Kingdom of Serbia]], which in 1918 formed [[Yugoslavia]]. Kosovo gained autonomy in 1963 under [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s direction, an autonomy which was significantly extended by Yugoslavia's 1974 Constitution, but lost its autonomous institutions in 1990.

The region of Illyria was  conquered by Rome in 168 BC, and made into the Roman province of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] in 59 BC. The Kosovo region probably became part of [[Moesia Superior]] in AD 87, although archaeological evidence suggests that it may have been divided between [[Dalmatia]] and Moesia.<ref name=\"Jankovic\"/>\n\n[[Image:Map of ancient Dardania and environs (English).svg|thumb|left|Dardania and its environs in pre-Roman times.]]\n\nAfter 284 [[Diocletian]] further divided Upper Moesia into the smaller provinces of Dardania, Moesia Prima, Dacia Ripensis, and Dacia Mediterranea. Dardania's capital was [[Naissus]], previously a Celts settlement.<ref name=\"Naissos\"/> The Roman province of Dardania included eastern parts of modern Kosovo, while its western part belonged to the newly formed Roman province of Prevalitana with its capital Doclea. The Romans colonised the region and founded several cities.\n\n[[Image:Ancient balkans 4thcentury.png|thumb|Roman province of Dardania in the 4th century AD.]]\n\nThe [[Hun]]nic invasions of 441 and 447-49 were the first barbarian invasions which were able to take Eastern Roman fortified centers and cities. Most Balkan cities were sacked by Attila, and recovered only partially if at all. While there is no direct written evidence of Hunnic invasion of Kosovo, its economic hinterland will anyway have been affected for centuries.<ref>Peter Heather, ''The Fall of the Roman Empire'', 2005, pp. 325\u2013350</ref>[[Justinian I]], who assumed the throne of the [[Byzantine Empire]] in 527, oversaw a period of Byzantine expansion into former Roman territories, and re-absorbed the area of Kosovo into the empire.\n\n[[Slavic migrations]] to the Balkans took place between the 6th to 7th centuries.\n\n==Middle Ages==\n{{Main|History of Medieval Kosovo}}\n\n===Bulgarian Period===\n[[Image:Bulgaria Simeon I (893-927).svg|thumb|right|200px|[[Kosovo]] in the 10th century.]]\n{{Main|First Bulgarian Empire|Second Bulgarian Empire}}\n\nThe region of Kosovo was incorporated into the [[Bulgarian Empire]] during the reign of [[Khan (title)|Khan]] [[Presian of Bulgaria|Presian]] (836\u2013852). Numerous churches and monasteries were constructed after the [[Christianization of Bulgaria|Christianization]] in 864. It remained within the borders of [[Bulgaria]] for 150 years until 1018, when the country was overrun by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantines]] after half-century bitter struggle. According to ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'' of the 10th century Byzantine Emperor [[Constantine VII]], the Serbian-populated lands lay to the north-west of [[Kosovo]] and the region was Bulgarian.\n\nDuring the [[Bulgarian uprising against the Byzantine Empire (1040-1041)|Uprising of Peter Delyan (1040\u20131041)]], [[Kosovo]] was briefly liberated and during the [[Uprising of Georgi Voiteh]] in 1072, [[Constantine Bodin|Peter III]] was proclaimed Emperor of Bulgaria in [[Prizren]] from where the Bulgarian army marched to [[Skopje]].\n\nIn the beginning of the 13th century, Kosovo was reincorporated in the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|restored Bulgarian Empire]] but the Bulgarian control faded after the death of Emperor [[Ivan Asen II of Bulgaria|Ivan Asen II]] (1218\u20131241).\n\n===Byzantine Period===\nWhen Kosovo was overrun by the Byzantines, the control was subsequently reasserted by Emperor [[Basil II]]. Serbia at that time was not a united state: a number of Serbian principalities lay to the north and west of Kosovo, of which [[Ra\u0161ka (state)|Ra\u0161ka]] and [[Duklja]] were the strongest. In the 1180s, the Serbian ruler [[Stefan Nemanja]] seized control of Duklja and parts of Kosovo. His successor, [[Stefan Prvoven\u010dani]] took control of the rest of Kosovo by 1216, creating a state incorporating most of the area which is now Serbia and [[Montenegro]].\n\n===Serbian Period===\n{{Further|Serbia in the Middle Ages|Serbian Empire}}\n[[Image:Serbia boundaries CIA.jpg|thumb|left|190px|''\"Kosovo: History of a Balkan Hot Spot\"'']]\n[[File:Car Du\u0161an, Manastir Lesnovo, XIV vek, Makedonija.jpg|thumb|190px|[[Stefan Du\u0161an]] assigned the city of [[Prizren]] as the capital of the [[Serbian Empire]].]]\n\nKosovo was absorbed into the [[Serbia]]n state of Rascia in the late 12th and early 13th centuries,<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'', p.44</ref> and was part of the [[Serbian Empire]] from 1346 to 1371. In 1389, in the [[Battle of Kosovo]] occurred, which ended in a stalemate (both rulers, [[Murad I]] and [[Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107]], were killed).\n\nDuring the rule of the [[Nemanji\u0107]] dynasty (c. 1160\u20131355), many [[Serbian Orthodox]] churches and monasteries were built throughout Serbian territory. From the mid-13th century to the end of the century, the Nemanji\u0107 rulers had their main residences in Kosovo.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of the Balkans'', p.50</ref> Large estates were given to the monasteries in Western Kosovo ([[Metohija]]). The most prominent churches in Kosovo \u2013 the [[Patriarchate]] at [[Pe\u0107]], the church at [[Gra\u010danica, Kosovo|Gra\u010danica]] and the monastery at [[Visoki De\u010dani]] near [[De\u010dani]] \u2013 were all founded during this period.  Kosovo was economically important, as the modern Kosovo capital [[Pri\u0161tina]] was a major trading centre on routes leading to ports on the [[Adriatic Sea]]. Also, mining was an important industry in [[Novo Brdo]] and [[Janjevo]] which had its communities of \u00e9migr\u00e9 [[Saxons|Saxon]] miners and [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusan]] merchants. In 1450 the mines of Novo Brdo were producing about 6,000&nbsp;kg of silver per year.\n\nThe ethnic composition of Kosovo's population during this period included Serbs, Albanians, and [[Vlachs]] along with a token number of [[Greeks]], [[Croats]], [[Armenians]], Saxons, and [[Bulgarians]], according to Serbian monastic charters or ''chrysobulls''. A majority of the names given in the charters are overwhelmingly Slavic rather than Albanian. This has been interpreted as evidence of an overwhelming Serbian majority. This claim seems to be supported by the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] cadastral tax-census ([[defter]]) of 1455 which took into account religion and language and found an overwhelming [[Kosovo population data-points|Serb majority]]. But, since there are many examples of both Slavic and Albanian names occurring within the same family, name evidence must be treated with caution;<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' p.56</ref> giving children \"foreign\" names can occur through inter-marriage, through imitation of a socially superior class from a different ethnic group, or simply through fashion.\n\nEthnic identity in the [[Middle Ages]] was somewhat fluid throughout Europe, and most people at that time do not appear to have defined themselves rigidly by ethnicity. Serbian-speakers were the major linguistic group in this period.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Milica Grkovi\u0107|year=2004|title=De\u010danski hrisovulja ili rasko\u0161ni svitak|trans-title=De\u010dani chrysobull...|journal=Zbornik Matice Srpske Za Knji\u017eevnost I Jezik|volume=52|issue=3|pp=623\u2013626|url=http://scindeks-clanci.nb.rs/data/pdf/0543-1220/2004/0543-12200403623R.pdf|access-date=26 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826204755/http://scindeks-clanci.nb.rs/data/pdf/0543-1220/2004/0543-12200403623R.pdf|archive-date=26 August 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Pavle Ivi\u0107 and Milica Grkovi\u0107|year=1976|title=De\u010danske hrisovulje|publisher=Institute of Linguistics (Novi Sad)|ol=3892638M}}</ref><ref>{{citation|author=Olgica Brankovi\u0107|year=1972|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/98035320/Oblast-Brankovica-Opsirni-Katastarski-Popis-Iz-1455-Godine|title=Oblast Brankovi\u0107a: op\u0161irni katastarski popiz iz 1455|publisher=Oriental Institute in Sarajevo}}</ref>\n\nIn 1355, the Serbian state fell apart on the death of [[Tsar]] [[Stefan Du\u0161an]] and dissolved into squabbling fiefdoms. The timing fell perfectly within the Ottoman expansion. The Ottoman Empire took the opportunity of this vacuum to expand its power, just as the Nemanji\u0107s had exploited periods of Byzantine weakness or division in their major expansions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2013}}\n\n====Battle of Kosovo====\n\n====First Battle of Kosovo====\n{{See also|Battle of Kosovo}}\n\n[[File:Battle of Kosovo, Adam Stefanovi\u0107, 1870.jpg|thumb|right|190px|[[Battle of Kosovo]] in 1389 determined the future of central Balkans and marked the beginning of disintegration of the [[Serbian Empire]]]]\n\nThe [[Battle of Kosovo|First Battle of Kosovo]] occurred on the field of [[Kosovo Polje]] on June 28, 1389, when the ruling ''[[Knez (title)|knez]]'' (prince) of Serbia, [[Lazar Hrebeljanovi\u0107]], marshalled a coalition of Christian soldiers, made up of Serbs, but in small numbers also of [[Bosnians]], [[Albanians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Magyars]]  and a troop of Saxon mercenaries. [[Sultan]] [[Murad I]] also gathered a coalition of soldiers and volunteers from neighbouring countries in [[Anatolia]] and [[Rumelia]]. Exact numbers are difficult to come by, but most reliable historical accounts suggest that the Christian army was heavily outnumbered by the Ottomans.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} The combined numbers of the two armies are believed to be less than 100,000.\n\nThe Serbian army was defeated and Lazar was slain, although Murad I was killed, according to tradition by [[Milo\u0161 Obili\u0107]], or Kobili\u0107 as he was always called until the 18th century; he has been variously described as a Serb, an Albanian, and a Hungarian.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp.68\u201374</ref> Although the battle has been mythologised as a great Serbian defeat, at the time opinion was divided as to whether it was a Serbian defeat, a stalemate or possibly even a Serbian victory. Serbian principalities continued their existence, usually as vassals of the Ottomans, and maintained sporadic control of Kosovo, until the final extinction of the Despotate of Serbia in 1459, following which Serbia became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The fortress of Novo Brdo, important at the time due to its rich silver mines, came under siege for forty days by the Ottomans during that year, capitulating and becoming occupied by the Ottomans on June 1, 1455.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp. 81\u201392.</ref>\n\n====Second Battle of Kosovo====\n{{See also|Battle of Kosovo (1448)}}\n\nThe [[Battle of Kosovo (1448)|Second Battle of Kosovo]] was fought over two days in October 1448, between a Hungarian force led by [[John Hunyadi]] and an Ottoman army led by [[Murad II]]. Significantly larger than the first battle, with both armies numbering twice that of the first battle,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} the ending was the same, and the Hungarian army was defeated in the battle and pushed from the field. Although the loss of the battle was a setback for those resisting the Ottoman invasion of Europe at that time, it was not a 'crushing blow to the cause'. Hunyadi was able to maintain Hungarian resistance to the Ottomans during his lifetime.\n\n====Significance====\nThe overall significance of these battles (within their medieval context) remains disputed,<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'' pp 55\u201380</ref> although the First Battle of Kosovo has become, for Serbians since their independence at least, a national symbol for heroism and an admirable 'fight against all odds', and may therefore have assumed a significance that it lacked . It seems unlikely that single battles could seriously have affected the rise of Ottoman power. In the First Battle of Kosovo, Sultan Murat I was the first Ottoman ruler to lose his life in combat; his successor Sultan Bayazid I went on to expand Ottoman territories significantly despite defeats in Wallachia, in his siege of Constantinople, and his crushing defeat in the battle of Ankara, in which he was captured and which resulted in a civil war for the succession. Despite these defeats, Ottoman power continued to expand.\n\nThe Second Battle of Kosovo might have had more significance<ref>Noel Malcolm ''A Short History of Kosovo'', pp. 87\u201391</ref>  in that there were two powers simultaneously resisting the Ottomans (the Hungarians under Hunyadi and the Albanians under Skanderbeg), with Skanderbeg only narrowly missed joining Hunyadi for the battle. While the resistance of the Byzantines, Serbians, Hungarians, Albanians and Wallachians should have given the Austrians (and Italians) more time to prepare for an Ottoman threat against them, it is by no means clear that they believed the threat to be serious or consciously prepared for it.\n\n===Ottoman Period===\n{{Main|History of Ottoman Kosovo}}\n{{See also|Vilayet of Kosovo}}\n{{See also|History of Ottoman Albania}}\n\n{{Main|20th century history of Kosovo}}\n[[Image:Kosovo02.png|thumb|[[Vilayet of Kosovo]], 1875\u20131878.]]\n[[Image:Vilayet of Kosovo (1881\u20131913) map.png|thumb|[[Vilayet of Kosovo]], 1881\u20131912.]]\n[[File:Ernst-Ravenstein-Balkans-Ethnic-Map-1880.jpg|thumb|Ethnographic map of the Balkans in the end of the 19th century.]]\nThe [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] brought [[Islam]] with them and later also created the [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] as one of the Ottoman territorial entities. Ottoman rule lasted for about 500 years, in which time the Ottomans were the absolute power in the region. Many Slavs converted to Islam and served under Ottomans. Kosovo was taken temporarily by the Austrian forces during the War of 1683\u20131699 with help of Serbs but were defeated and retreated shortly thereafter. In 1690, the [[Serbian Patriarch of Pe\u0107]] [[Arsenije III]], who had previously escaped a certain death, fled to Austria as did 30\u201340,000 people (according to the Patriarch).<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'', p. 161</ref> He was probably referring only to Serbs; numbers of Albanians also fled. Due to the oppression from the Ottomans, other migrations of Orthodox people from the Kosovo area continued throughout the 18th century. Most Albanians eventually adopted [[Islam]], while most Serbs did not.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''A Short History of Kosovo'', pp.104\u2013138</ref>\n\nIn 1766, the Ottomans abolished the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Pe\u0107]] and the position of [[Christians]] in Kosovo was greatly reduced.\n\n==Modern==\nThe territory of today's province was for centuries ruled by the Ottoman Empire. During this period several administrative districts known as [[sanjak]]s (\"banners\" or districts) each ruled by a ''sanjakbey'' (roughly equivalent to \"district lord\") have included parts of the territory as parts of their territories. Despite the imposition of [[Muslim]] rule, large numbers of [[Christians]] continued to live and sometimes even prosper under the Ottomans. A process of [[Islamisation]] began shortly after the beginning of Ottoman rule but it took a considerable amount of time \u2013 at least a century \u2013 and was concentrated at first on the towns. A large part of the reason for the conversion was probably economic and social, as Muslims had considerably more rights and privileges than Christian subjects. Christian religious life nonetheless continued, while churches were largely left alone by the Ottomans, but both the [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] and [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] churches and their congregations suffered from high levels of taxation.\n\nFrom the 17th century, there is evidence of an increasing proportion of Albanian-speakers in Kosovo, spreading from the West. Some of this seems to have been the result of migration from the mountains of modern Albania into lands which could support higher populations, and that the putative migrants brought Islam with them. Catholic Albanians who found it convenient to be officially Muslim (whatever their origins) were not allowed by the Vatican to continue Catholic rites in private, and therefore became increasingly Islamised.<ref>Noel Malcolm, ''Short History of Kosovo'', pp. 114\u2013138</ref>\n\nIn 1689 Kosovo was greatly disrupted in the course of the [[Great Turkish War]] (1683\u20131699), in one of the pivotal events. In October 1689, a small [[Habsburg Monarcy|Habsburg]] force under [[Margrave]] [[Louis William, Margrave of Baden-Baden|Ludwig of Baden]] breached the Ottoman Empire and reached as far as Kosovo, following their earlier capture of [[Belgrade]]. Many Serbs and Albanians pledged their loyalty to the [[Austrians]], some joining Ludwig's army. This was by no means a universal reaction; many other Albanians fought alongside the Ottomans to resist the Austrian advance. A massive Ottoman counter-attack the following summer drove the Austrians back to their fortress at [[Ni\u0161]], then back to Belgrade, then finally back across the [[Danube]] into Austria.\n\nIn 1878, one of the four [[vilayet]]s with Albanian inhabitants that formed the [[League of Prizren]] was [[Vilayet of Kosovo]]. The League's purpose was to resist both Ottoman rule and incursions by the newly emerging Balkan nations.\n\n[[file: Ethnic map of Balkans - german 1882.jpg|thumb|Ethnic map of Balkans \u2013 Heinrich Kiepert 1882.]]\n\nIn 1910, an Albanian insurrection, which was possibly aided surreptitiously by the [[Young Turks]] to put pressure on the [[Ottoman Porte|Sublime Porte]], broke out in [[Pristina]] and soon spread to the entire vilayet of Kosovo, lasting for three months. The Sultan visited Kosovo in June 1911 during peace settlement talks covering all Albanian-inhabited areas.\n\n===Albanian National Movement===\n{{Main|Albanian National Revival|Expulsion of the Albanians 1877-1878}}\nThe Albanian national movement was inspired by various factors. Besides the National Renaissance that had been promoted by Albanian activists, political reasons were a contributing factor. In the 1870s the Ottoman Empire experienced a tremendous contraction in territory and defeats in wars against the Slavic monarchies of Europe. During and after the [[Serbian\u2013Ottoman War (1876\u201378)|Serbian\u2013Ottoman War]] of 1876\u201378, between 30,000 and 70,000 Muslims, mostly Albanians, were expelled by the [[Armed forces of the Principality of Serbia|Serb army]] from the [[Sanjak of Ni\u0161|Sanjak of Ni\u0219]] and fled to the Kosovo Vilayet.<ref>Pllana, Emin (1985). \"Les raisons de la mani\u00e8re de l'exode des refugies albanais du territoire du sandjak de Nish a Kosove (1878\u20131878) [The reasons for the manner of the exodus of Albanian refugees from the territory of the Sanjak of Ni\u0161 to Kosovo (1878\u20131878)] \".

During its three years of existence the League sought the creation of an [[Albanian vilayet]] within the Ottoman Empire, raised an army and fought a defensive war. In 1881 a provisional government was formed to administer Albania under the presidency of [[Ymer Prizreni]], assisted by prominent ministers such as [[Abdyl Frash\u00ebri]] and [[Sulejman Vokshi]]. Nevertheless, military intervention from the Balkan states, the Great Powers as well as Turkey divided the Albanian troops in three fronts, which brought about the end of the League.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>Hysni Myzyri, \"Kreu VIII: Lidhja Shqiptare e Prizrenit (1878\u20131881),\" ''Historia e popullit shqiptar: p\u00ebr shkollat e mesme'' (Libri Shkollor: Prishtin\u00eb, 2002) 149\u2013172.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://historia.shqiperia.com/rilindja/kreu_5.php|title=LIDHJA SHQIPTARE E PRIZRENIT - (1878 - 1881)|website=historia.shqiperia.com}}</ref>\n\nKosovo was yet home to other Albanian organisations, the most important being the [[League of Peja]], named after the city in which it was founded in 1899.

Considering this, an unsuccessful uprising was organised by Albanian highlanders in Kosovo in February 1909. The adversity escalated after the takeover of the Turkish government by an oligarchic group later that year. In April 1910, armies led by [[Idriz Seferi]] and Isa Boletini rebelled against the Turkish troops, but were finally forced to withdraw after having caused many casualties amongst the enemy.<ref>Hysni Myzyri, \"Kryengritjet shqiptare t\u00eb viteve 1909\u20131911,\" ''Historia e popullit shqiptar: p\u00ebr shkollat e mesme'' (Libri Shkollor: Prishtin\u00eb, 2002) 195\u2013198.</ref>\n\nA further Albanian rebellion in 1912 was the pretext for Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, and Bulgaria beginning the [[First Balkan War]] against the Ottoman Empire. Most of Kosovo was incorporated into the [[History of Serbia|Kingdom of Serbia]], while the region of [[Metohija]] ({{lang-sq|Dukagjini Valley}}) was taken by the [[History of Montenegro|Kingdom of Montenegro]]. Kosovo was split into four counties: three being a part of the entity of Serbia (Zve\u010dan, Kosovo and southern Metohija); one of Montenegro (Northern Metohija).\n\n===Interbellum Period===\n[[Image:Map of Kosovo during WW II.png|thumb|left|Kosovo in 1941]]\n{{Main|Colonisation of Kosovo}}\nThe 1918\u20131929 period of the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenians witnessed a rise of the Serbian population in the region and a [[The Forced Deportation of Albanians in the Years 1912\u20131941|decline]] in the non-Serbian.\n\nIn 1929, Kosovo was split between the [[Zeta Banovina]] in the west with the capital in [[Cetinje]], [[Vardar Banovina]] in the southeast with the capital in [[Skopje]] and the [[Morava Banovina]] in the northeast with the capital in [[Ni\u0161]].\n\nAfter the Axis [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] in 1941, most of Kosovo was assigned to Italian-controlled Albania, with the rest being controlled by Germany and Bulgaria. A three-dimensional conflict ensued, involving inter-ethnic, ideological, and international affiliations, with the first being most important. Nonetheless, these conflicts were relatively low-level compared with other areas of Yugoslavia during the war years, with one Serb historian estimating that 3,000 Albanians and 4,000 Serbs and Montenegrins were killed, and two others estimating war dead at 12,000 Albanians and 10,000 Serbs and Montenegrins.<ref>Malcolm, Noel ''Kosovo: A Short History'', p.312</ref> Most sources put the numbers of Serbs killed during WWII in Kosovo at anywhere from 10,000-40,000, with 250,000 forcibly expelled.  \"We should endeavor to ensure that the Serb population of Kosovo should be removed as soon as possible ... All indigenous Serbs who have been living here for centuries should be termed colonialists and as such, via the Albanian and Italian governments, should be sent to concentration camps in Albania.

Both Albanian and Yugoslav communists signed the agreement, according to which Kosovo would have the right to democratically decide whether it wants to remain in Albania or become part of Serbia. This was seen as the marxist solution for Kosovo. The agreement was not respected by Yugoslavia, since Tito knew that Serbia would not accept it.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.albanianhistory.net/1944_Resolution-of-Bujan/index.html |title=The Resolution of Bujan |website=Albanian History |publisher=Robert Elsie |accessdate=27 July 2019 }}</ref> Some Albanians, especially in the region in and around Drenica in central Kosovo revolted against the Yugoslav communists for not respecting the agreement. In response, the Yugoslavs called the rebels Nazi and Fascist collaborators and responded with violence. The Albanian Kosovar military leader [[Shaban Polluzha]], who first fought with Yugoslav partisans but then refused to collaborate further, was attacked and killed.

The Communist government did not permit the return of all of the refugees.\n\nWith the passing of the 1974 Yugoslavia constitution, Kosovo gained virtual self-government. The province's government has applied Albanian curriculum to Kosovo's schools: surplus and obsolete textbooks from [[Enver Hoxha]]'s Albania were obtained and put into use.\n\nThroughout the 1980s tensions between the Albanian and Serb communities in the province escalated.<ref name=\"reuters19860527\">Reuters 1986-05-27, \"Kosovo Province Revives Yugoslavia's Ethnic Nightmare\"</ref><ref name=\"csm19860728\">Christian Science Monitor 1986-07-28, \"Tensions among ethnic groups in Yugoslavia begin to boil over\"</ref> The Albanian community favoured greater autonomy for Kosovo, whilst Serbs favoured closer ties with the rest of Serbia. There was little appetite for unification with Albania itself, which was ruled by a [[Stalinist]] government and had considerably worse living standards than Kosovo. Beginning in March 1981, Kosovar Albanian students organised [[1981 protests in Kosovo|protests seeking that Kosovo become a republic within Yugoslavia]].

By the end of the year Milo\u0161evi\u0107 was in control of the Serbian government.\n\nThrough 1988 and 1989, dominant forces in Serbian politics engaged in a series of moves that became known as the [[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]. The leading politicians of Kosovo and the northern province of [[Vojvodina]] were sacked and replaced, and the level of autonomy of the provinces started to be unilaterally reduced by the Serbian federal authority. In protest, the Kosovo Albanians engaged in mass demonstrations, and Trep\u010da miners [[1989 Kosovo miners' strike|began a hunger strike]].\n\nThe new constitution significantly reduced the provinces' rights, permitting the government of Serbia to exert direct control over many previously autonomous areas of governance. In particular, the constitutional changes handed control of the police, the court system, the economy, the education system and language policies to the Serbian government.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}}\nIt was strongly opposed by many of Serbia's national minorities, who saw it as a means of imposing ethnically based centralised rule on the provinces.<ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,970851,00.html Yugoslavia The Old Demons Arise], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', August 06, 1990</ref>\n\nThe Albanian representatives in provincial government largely opposed the constitutional changes and abstained from ratification in the Kosovo assembly.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}} In March 1989, preceding a final push for ratification, the Yugoslav police rounded up around 240 prominent Kosovo Albanians, apparently selected based on their anti-ratification sentiment, and detained them with complete disregard for [[due process]].{{sfn|Anderson|1990|pp=27\u201329}} When the assembly met to discuss the proposals, tanks and armoured cars surrounded the meeting place.{{sfn|Judah|2008|p=56}} Though the final vote failed to reach the required two-thirds majority threshold, it was declared as having passed.{{sfn|Krieger|2001|p=522}}\n\n===Kosovo War===\n{{Kosovo War}}\nAfter the constitutional changes, the parliaments of all Yugoslavian republics and provinces, which until then had MPs only from the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]], were dissolved and multi-party elections were held for them.

As election laws required  turnout higher than 50%, the parliament of Kosovo could not be established.\n\nThe new constitution abolished the individual provinces' official media, integrating them within the official media of Serbia while still retaining some programs in the [[Albanian language]]. The Albanian-language media in Kosovo was suppressed. Funding was withdrawn from state-owned media, including that in the Albanian language in Kosovo. The constitution made creating privately owned media possible, however their functioning was very difficult because of high rents and restricting laws.

Following mass rioting and unrest from Albanians as well as outbreaks of inter-communal violence,{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} in February 1990, a state of emergency was declared, and the presence of the Yugoslav Army and police was significantly increased to quell the unrest.\n\nUnsanctioned elections were held in 1992, which overwhelmingly elected [[Ibrahim Rugova]] as \"president\" of a self-declared Republic of Kosovo; however these elections were not recognised by Serbian nor any foreign government. In 1995, thousands of Serb refugees from [[Croatia]] settled in Kosovo, which further worsened relations between the two communities.\n{{Multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width     = 220\n | image1    = Memorial - Vushtrri.jpg\n | caption1  = Memorial to Albanian victims in [[Vu\u010ditrn]]\n | image2    = Monument to Serbs Killed in Kosovo since 1990s - Mitrovica (Serb Side) - Kosovo.jpg\n | caption2  = Monument to Serbian victims in [[Mitrovica, Kosovo|Mitrovica]]\n}}\n\nAlbanian opposition to sovereignty of Yugoslavia and especially Serbia had surfaced in rioting (1968 and March 1981) in the capital [[Pristina]]. Ibrahim Rugova initially advocated non-violent resistance, but later opposition took the form of separatist agitation by opposition political groups and armed action from 1996 by the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] (KLA; Alb. ''Ushtria \u00c7lirimtare e Kosov\u00ebs'' or ''U\u00c7K'').\n\nThe KLA launched a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] and [[terrorism|terror campaign]], characterised by regular bomb and gun attacks on Yugoslav security forces, state officials and civilians known to openly support the national government, this included Albanians who were non-sympathizers with KLA motives. In March 1998, Yugoslav army units joined Serbian police to fight the separatists, using military force. In the months that followed, thousands of Albanian civilians were killed and more than 10,000 fled their homes; most of these people were Albanian. Many Albanian families were forced to flee their homes at gunpoint, as a result of fighting between national security and KLA forces leading to expulsions by the security forces including associated paramilitary militias. The [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR) estimated that 460,000 people had been displaced from March 1998 to the start of the NATO bombing campaign in March 1999.<ref>{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/news/opendoc.htm?tbl=NEWS&page=home&id=3ae6b80dc |title=Kosovo Crisis Update |publisher=UNHCR |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>\n\nThere was violence against non-Albanians as well: UNHCR reported (March 1999) that over 90 mixed villages in Kosovo \"have now been emptied of Serb inhabitants\" and other Serbs continue leaving, either to be displaced in other parts of Kosovo or fleeing into central Serbia. The [[Yugoslav Red Cross]] estimated there were more than 130,000 non-Albanian displaced in need of assistance in Kosovo, most of whom were Serb.<ref>[http://www.refugees.org/news/crisis/kosovo_u0399.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041210223223/http://www.refugees.org/news/crisis/kosovo_u0399.htm |date=December 10, 2004 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:Kukes Refugee Camp.jpg|thumb|left|Refugee camp near [[Kuk\u00ebs]], [[Albania]] (1999)]]\nFollowing the breakdown of negotiations between Serbian and Albanian representatives, under [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) auspices, NATO intervened on March 24, 1999 without United Nations authority. NATO launched a campaign of heavy bombing against Yugoslav military targets and then moved to wide range bombings (like bridges in Novi Sad). A full-scale war broke out as KLA continued to attack Serbian forces and Serbian/Yugoslav forces continued to fight KLA amidst a massive displacement of the population of Kosovo, which most human rights groups and international organisations regarded as an act of [[ethnic cleansing]] perpetrated by the government forces. A number of senior Yugoslav government officials and military officers, including President Milo\u0161evi\u0107, were subsequently indicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia ([[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]]) for [[war crime]]s. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 died in detention before a verdict was rendered.\n\nThe [[United Nations]] estimated that during the Kosovo War, nearly 40,000 Albanians fled or were expelled from Kosovo between March 1998 and the end of April 1999. Most of the refugees went to Albania, the [[Republic of Macedonia]], or [[Montenegro]]. Government security forces confiscated and destroyed the documents and licence plates of many fleeing Albanians in what was widely regarded as an attempt to erase the identities of the refugees, the term \"[[identity cleansing]]\" being coined to denote this action. This made it difficult to distinguish with certainty the identity of returning refugees after the war. Serbian sources claim that many Albanians from Macedonia and Albania \u2013 perhaps as many as 300,000, by some estimates \u2013 have since migrated to Kosovo in the guise of refugees. The entire issue is moot, however, due to the survival of birth and death records.\n\n===Post Kosovo War===\n{{Further|United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|Constitutional status of Kosovo|Kosovo status process|2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Republic of Kosovo}}\n\nThe war ended on June 10, 1999 with the Serbian and Yugoslav governments signing the [[Kumanovo Agreement]] which agreed to transfer governance of the province to the United Nations. A NATO-led Kosovo Force ([[Kosovo Force|KFOR]]) entered the province following the [[Kosovo War]], tasked with providing security to the UN Mission in Kosovo ([[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]]). Before and during the handover of power, an estimated 100,000 Serbs and other non-Albanians, mostly Serbs, fled the province for fear of reprisals. In the case of the non-Albanians, the Roma in particular were regarded by many Albanians as having assisted the Serbs during the war. Many left along with the withdrawing Serbian security forces, expressing fears that they would be targeted by returning Albanian refugees and KLA fighters who blamed them for wartime acts of violence. Thousands more were driven out by intimidation, attacks and a wave of crime after the war as KFOR struggled to restore order in the province.\n\nLarge numbers of refugees from Kosovo still live in temporary camps and shelters in Serbia proper. In 2002, Serbia and Montenegro reported hosting 277,000 internally displaced people (the vast majority being Serbs and Roma from Kosovo), which included 201,641 persons displaced from Kosovo into Serbia proper, 29,451 displaced from Kosovo into Montenegro, and about 46,000 displaced within Kosovo itself, including 16,000 returning refugees unable to inhabit their original homes.<ref>[http://www.refugees.org/world/countryrpt/europe/yugoslavia.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041029061224/http://www.refugees.org/world/countryrpt/europe/yugoslavia.htm |date=October 29, 2004 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&id=414ad5b57&page=statistics ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613013001/http://www.unhcr.ch/cgi-bin/texis/vtx/statistics/opendoc.pdf?tbl=STATISTICS&id=414ad5b57&page=statistics |date=June 13, 2011 }}</ref>\nSome sources put the figure far lower; the European Stability Initiative estimates the number of displaced people as being only 65,000, with another 40,000 Serbs remaining in Kosovo, though this would leave a significant proportion of the pre-1999 ethnic Serb population unaccounted-for.
