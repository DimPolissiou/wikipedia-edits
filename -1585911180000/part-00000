Spoken as a [[first language]] by around two million people, it serves as the official language of [[North Macedonia]]. Most speakers can be found in the country and [[Macedonian diaspora|its diaspora]], with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Macedonian is also a recognized [[minority language]] in parts of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]] and spoken by emigrant communities predominantly in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\nMacedonian developed out of the western [[dialect]]s of the East South Slavic [[dialect continuum]], whose earliest recorded form is \"[[Old Church Slavonic]]\". During much of its history, this dialect continuum was called \"Bulgarian\" although in the 19th century the western dialects came to be known separately as \"Macedonian\". [[Standard Macedonian]] was codified in 1945 and has developed [[Macedonian literature#Modern literature|modern literature]] since.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Harvnb|Thornburg|Fuller|2006|page=213}}</ref> As it is part of a dialect continuum with other [[South Slavic language]]s, Macedonian has a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]]. \n\nLinguists distinguish 29 [[dialects of Macedonian]], with linguistic differences separating Western and Eastern groups of dialects. Some features of [[Macedonian grammar]] are the use of a dynamic [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] that falls on the ante-penultimate syllable, three suffixed [[deixis|deictic articles]] that indicate noun position in reference to the speaker and several simple and complex verb tenses. [[Macedonian orthography]] is phonemic with a correspondence of one [[grapheme]] per [[phoneme]]. It is written using an adapted 31-letter version of the [[Cyrillic script]] with several original letters. Macedonian [[syntax]] is of the [[subject-object-verb]] (SOV) type and has flexible [[word order]].\n\nMacedonian vocabulary has been historically influenced by [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Somewhat less prominent vocabulary influences also came from neighboring and [[prestige (linguistics)|prestige languages]]. Since Macedonian and Bulgarian are mutually intelligible, share many common linguistic features and are socio-historically related, some [[political views on the Macedonian language|linguists are divided in their views]] of the two as separate languages or as a single [[pluricentric language]].\n\n==Classification and related languages==\n[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|left|alt=Language-tree graph|Classification of Macedonian within the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the Indo-European language family]]\nThe modern Macedonian language belongs to the [[East South Slavic languages|eastern group]] of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] branch of [[Slavic languages]] in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, together with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and the extinct [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Some authors also classify the [[Torlakian dialects]] in this group.

[[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'.

The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory). This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109-110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels. [[Disyllabic]] words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable: ''\u0434\u00e9\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8d\u025bt\u025b]}}: child), ''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8majka]}}): mother) and ''\u0442\u00e1\u0442\u043a\u043e'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8tatk\u0254]}}: father). [[Trisyllabic]] and [[polysyllabic]] words are stressed on the third-to-last syllable: ''\u043f\u043b\u00e1\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8p\u026banina]}}: mountain) ''\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u045d\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430'' ({{IPA|[p\u026ba\u02c8ninata]}}: the mountain) ''\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u00e1\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[p\u026bani\u02c8narit\u025b]}}: the mountaineers).<ref name=\"usikova109\" /> There are several exceptions to the rule and they include: [[Participle|verbal adverbs]] (i.e. words suffixed with ''-\u045c\u0438''): e.g. ''\u0432\u0438\u043a\u00e1\u0458\u045c\u0438'' ({{IPA|[vi\u02c8kajci]}}: shouting), ''\u043e\u0434\u00e9\u0458\u045c\u0438'' ({{IPA|[\u0254\u02c8d\u025bjci]}}: walking); adverbs of time: ''\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u00e1\u0432\u0430'' ({{IPA|[godi\u02c8nava]}}: this year), ''\u043b\u0435\u0442\u00f3\u0432\u043e'' ({{IPA|[le\u02c8tovo]}}: this summer); foreign [[loanword]]s: e.g. ''\u043a\u043b\u0438\u0448\u00e9'' ({{IPA|[kli\u02c8\u0283\u025b]}}:clich\u00e9), ''\u0433\u0435\u043d\u00e9\u0437\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u0261\u025b\u02c8n\u025bza]}} genesis), ''\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u00fd\u0440\u0430'' ({{IPA|[lit\u025bra\u02c8tura]}}: literature), ''\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u00e1\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440'' ({{IPA|[al\u025bk\u02c8sandar]}}, [[Alexander]]).\n\nLinking occurs when two or more words are pronounced with the same stress. Linking is a common feature of the Macedonian language. This linguistic phenomenon is called ''\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442'' and is denoted with a (\u035c ) sign. Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable. The rule applies when using [[clitics]] (either enclitics or proclitics) such as the negating particle ''\u043d\u0435'' with verbs (''\u0442\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he did not come) and with short pronoun forms. The future particle ''\u045c\u0435'' can also be used in-between and falls under the same rules (''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u043c\u0443  \u035c  \u0458\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435'', did not give it to him; ''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u045c\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he will not come).<ref name=\"matura\" /> Other uses include the [[imperative form]] accompanied by short pronoun forms (''\u0434\u00e1\u0458  \u035c  \u043c\u0438'': give me), the expression of possessives (''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430  \u035c  \u043c\u0438''), prepositions followed by a noun (''\u0437\u00e1\u0434  \u035c  \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430''), question words followed by verbs (''\u043a\u043e\u0433\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'') and some compound nouns (''\u0441\u0443\u0432\u00f3  \u035c  \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0458\u0435'' - raisins, ''\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u00f3  \u035c  \u043c\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e'' - yoghurt) among others.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Macedonian grammar}}\n\nMacedonian grammar is markedly [[Analytic language|analytic]] in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic [[case system]]. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]]. Macedonian distinguishes at least 12 major [[part of speech|word classes]], five of which are modifiable and include nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numbers and verbs and seven of which are invariant and include [[adverb]]s, prepositions, [[conjunction]]s, [[interjection]]s, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and [[Linguistic modality|modal words]].<ref name=\"opsta\" /> \n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{Harvnb|Bogdanoska|2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills). Irregular plural forms also exist in the language: ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 - \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'' (child - children).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Definiteness====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+The definite articles\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" |\n!colspan=\"3\" | Singular\n!colspan=\"3\" | Plural\n|-\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n|-\n!Unspecified\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0442''''' \n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0442\u0430''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' \n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0442\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0442\u0435''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0442\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Proximate\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0432'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0432o'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''\n|  ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Distal\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u043d'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u043do'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n|}\n\nA characteristic feature of the nominal system is the indication of [[definiteness]]. As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives accompany nouns and serve to provide additional information about their referents. Macedonian adjectives [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify and are thus are thus inflected for gender, number and definiteness and  ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432'' changes to ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'', a beautiful woman) when used to describe a feminine noun, ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e'' when used to describe a neuter noun (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', a beautiful childd) and ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438'' when used to form the plural (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'').<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nAdjectives can be analytically inflected for degree of [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] with the prefix ''\u043f\u043e-'' marking the [[comparative]] and the prefix ''\u043d\u0430\u0458-'' marking the [[superlative]].

Case relations are marked in pronouns. Personal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

These pronouns are inflected for gender and number and other word forms can be derived from them (''\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0458'' - nobody, ''\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - something, ''\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0458'' - everybody's). There are three groups of demonstrative pronouns that can indicate proximate (''\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0458'' - this one (mas.)), distal (''\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0430'' - the one there (fem.)) and unspecific (''\u0442\u043e\u0430'' - that one (neut.)) objects.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative]] and [[conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax and prepositions===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) [[word order]] which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS) form as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''

Spoken as a [[first language]] by around two million people, it serves as the official language of [[North Macedonia]]. Most speakers can be found in the country and [[Macedonian diaspora|its diaspora]], with a smaller number of speakers throughout the transnational [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]]. Macedonian is also a recognized [[minority language]] in parts of [[Albania]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Romania]], and [[Serbia]] and spoken by emigrant communities predominantly in [[Australia]], [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].\n\nMacedonian developed out of the western [[dialect]]s of the East South Slavic [[dialect continuum]], whose earliest recorded form is \"[[Old Church Slavonic]]\". During much of its history, this dialect continuum was called \"Bulgarian\" although in the 19th century the western dialects came to be known separately as \"Macedonian\". [[Standard Macedonian]] was codified in 1945 and has developed [[Macedonian literature#Modern literature|modern literature]] since.<ref name=\"Gilbert\">{{Harvnb|Thornburg|Fuller|2006|page=213}}</ref> As it is part of a dialect continuum with other [[South Slavic language]]s, Macedonian has a high degree of [[mutual intelligibility]] with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Serbo-Croatian]]. \n\nLinguists distinguish 29 [[dialects of Macedonian]], with linguistic differences separating Western and Eastern groups of dialects. Some features of [[Macedonian grammar]] are the use of a dynamic [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]] that falls on the ante-penultimate syllable, three suffixed [[deixis|deictic articles]] that indicate noun position in reference to the speaker and several simple and complex verb tenses. [[Macedonian orthography]] is phonemic with a correspondence of one [[grapheme]] per [[phoneme]]. It is written using an adapted 31-letter version of the [[Cyrillic script]] with several original letters. Macedonian [[syntax]] is of the [[subject-object-verb]] (SOV) type and has flexible [[word order]].\n\nMacedonian vocabulary has been historically influenced by [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. Somewhat less prominent vocabulary influences also came from neighboring and [[prestige (linguistics)|prestige languages]]. Since Macedonian and Bulgarian are mutually intelligible, share many common linguistic features and are socio-historically related, some [[political views on the Macedonian language|linguists are divided in their views]] of the two as separate languages or as a single [[pluricentric language]].\n\n==Classification and related languages==\n[[File:Slavic languages tree.svg|thumb|left|alt=Language-tree graph|Classification of Macedonian within the [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]] branch of the Indo-European language family]]\nThe modern Macedonian language belongs to the [[East South Slavic languages|eastern group]] of the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]] branch of [[Slavic languages]] in the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language family, together with [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and the extinct [[Old Church Slavonic]]. Some authors also classify the [[Torlakian dialects]] in this group.

[[Vowel length]] is not phonemic. Vowels in stressed open syllables in disyllablic words with stress on the penultimate can be realized as long, e.g. {{angbr|\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0441}} {{IPA-mk|\u02c8v\u025b\u02d0l\u025bs||Mk-Veles.ogg}} '[[Veles (city)|Veles]]'.

The latter realization is avoided by some speakers who strive for a clear, formal pronunciation.\n\n===Stress===\nThe [[Stress (linguistics)|word stress]] in Macedonian is {{linktext|antepenultimate}} and dynamic (expiratory). This means that it falls on the third from last [[syllable]] in words with three or more syllables, and on the first or only syllable in other words. This is sometimes disregarded when the word has entered the language more recently or from a foreign source.<ref name=\"usikova109\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=109-110}}</ref> To note which syllable of the word should be accented, Macedonian uses an apostrophe over its vowels. [[Disyllabic]] words are stressed on the second-to-last syllable: ''\u0434\u00e9\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8d\u025bt\u025b]}}: child), ''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8majka]}}): mother) and ''\u0442\u00e1\u0442\u043a\u043e'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8tatk\u0254]}}: father). [[Trisyllabic]] and [[polysyllabic]] words are stressed on the third-to-last syllable: ''\u043f\u043b\u00e1\u043d\u0438\u043d\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u02c8p\u026banina]}}: mountain) ''\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u045d\u043d\u0430\u0442\u0430'' ({{IPA|[p\u026ba\u02c8ninata]}}: the mountain) ''\u043f\u043b\u0430\u043d\u0438\u043d\u00e1\u0440\u0438\u0442\u0435'' ({{IPA|[p\u026bani\u02c8narit\u025b]}}: the mountaineers).<ref name=\"usikova109\" /> There are several exceptions to the rule and they include: [[Participle|verbal adverbs]] (i.e. words suffixed with ''-\u045c\u0438''): e.g. ''\u0432\u0438\u043a\u00e1\u0458\u045c\u0438'' ({{IPA|[vi\u02c8kajci]}}: shouting), ''\u043e\u0434\u00e9\u0458\u045c\u0438'' ({{IPA|[\u0254\u02c8d\u025bjci]}}: walking); adverbs of time: ''\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043d\u00e1\u0432\u0430'' ({{IPA|[godi\u02c8nava]}}: this year), ''\u043b\u0435\u0442\u00f3\u0432\u043e'' ({{IPA|[le\u02c8tovo]}}: this summer); foreign [[loanword]]s: e.g. ''\u043a\u043b\u0438\u0448\u00e9'' ({{IPA|[kli\u02c8\u0283\u025b]}}:clich\u00e9), ''\u0433\u0435\u043d\u00e9\u0437\u0430'' ({{IPA|[\u0261\u025b\u02c8n\u025bza]}} genesis), ''\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0430\u0442\u00fd\u0440\u0430'' ({{IPA|[lit\u025bra\u02c8tura]}}: literature), ''\u0410\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441\u00e1\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440'' ({{IPA|[al\u025bk\u02c8sandar]}}, [[Alexander]]).\n\nLinking occurs when two or more words are pronounced with the same stress. Linking is a common feature of the Macedonian language. This linguistic phenomenon is called ''\u0430\u043a\u0446\u0435\u043d\u0442\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0446\u0435\u043b\u043e\u0441\u0442'' and is denoted with a (\u035c ) sign. Several words are taken as a single unit and thus follow the rules of the stress falling on the antepenultimate syllable. The rule applies when using [[clitics]] (either enclitics or proclitics) such as the negating particle ''\u043d\u0435'' with verbs (''\u0442\u043e\u0458 \u043d\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he did not come) and with short pronoun forms. The future particle ''\u045c\u0435'' can also be used in-between and falls under the same rules (''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u043c\u0443  \u035c  \u0458\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u0430\u0434\u0435'', did not give it to him; ''\u043d\u0435  \u035c  \u045c\u00e9  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'', he will not come).<ref name=\"matura\" /> Other uses include the [[imperative form]] accompanied by short pronoun forms (''\u0434\u00e1\u0458  \u035c  \u043c\u0438'': give me), the expression of possessives (''\u043c\u00e1\u0458\u043a\u0430  \u035c  \u043c\u0438''), prepositions followed by a noun (''\u0437\u00e1\u0434  \u035c  \u0432\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0430''), question words followed by verbs (''\u043a\u043e\u0433\u00e1  \u035c  \u0434\u043e\u0458\u0434\u0435'') and some compound nouns (''\u0441\u0443\u0432\u00f3  \u035c  \u0433\u0440\u043e\u0437\u0458\u0435'' - raisins, ''\u043a\u0438\u0441\u0435\u043b\u00f3  \u035c  \u043c\u043b\u0435\u043a\u043e'' - yoghurt) among others.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n==Grammar==\n{{Main|Macedonian grammar}}\n\nMacedonian grammar is markedly [[Analytic language|analytic]] in comparison with other Slavic languages, having lost the common Slavic [[case system]]. The Macedonian language shows some special and, in some cases, unique characteristics due to its central position in the Balkans. Literary Macedonian is the only South Slavic literary language that has three forms of the definite article, based on the degree of proximity to the speaker, and a perfect tense formed by means of an [[auxiliary verb]] \"to have\", followed by a [[past tense|past]] [[participle]] in the [[Neuter gender|neuter]], also known as the [[verbal adjective]]. Macedonian distinguishes at least 12 major [[part of speech|word classes]], five of which are modifiable and include nouns, adjectives, pronouns, numbers and verbs and seven of which are invariant and include [[adverb]]s, prepositions, [[conjunction]]s, [[interjection]]s, [[Grammatical particle|particles]] and [[Linguistic modality|modal words]].<ref name=\"opsta\" /> \n\n===Nouns===\nMacedonian [[noun]]s (''\u0438\u043c\u0435\u043d\u043a\u0438'') belong to one of three [[Grammatical gender|genders]] (masculine, feminine, and neuter) and are [[Inflection|inflected]] for [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural), and marginally for [[grammatical case|case]]. The gender opposition is not distinctively marked in the plural.<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=40}}</ref> Masculine nouns usually end in a consonant or a vowel (''-a'', ''-o''  or ''-e'') and neuter nouns end in a vowel (''-o'' or ''-e''). Virtually all feminine nouns end in the same consonant, ''-a''.<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe [[vocative]] of nouns is the only remaining case in the Macedonian language and is used to address a person directly. The vocative case always ends with a vowel, which can be either an -\u0443 (''\u0458\u0443\u043d\u0430\u043a\u0443'': hero vocative) or an -e (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u0447\u0435'': man vocative) to the root of masculine nouns. For feminine nouns, the most common final vowel ending in the vocative is -o (''\u0434\u0443\u0448\u043e'', sweetheart vocative; ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u043e'', wife vocative). The final suffix -e can be used in the following cases: three or polysyllabic words with the ending ''-\u0438\u0446\u0430'' (''\u043c\u0430\u0458\u0447\u0438\u0446\u0435'', mother vocative), female given names that end with ''-\u043a\u0430'': ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0430'' becomes ''\u0420\u0430\u0442\u043a\u0435'' and ''-\u0458\u0430'': ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430'' becomes ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0435'' or ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u043e''. There is no vocative case in neuter nouns. The role of the vocative is only facultative and there is a general tendency of vocative loss in the language since its use is considered impolite and dialectal.<ref name=\"periods23\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|page=23}}</ref> The vocative can also be expressed by changing the tone.<ref name=\"matura\">{{Harvnb|Bogdanoska|2008}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Minova Gjurkova|first=Liljana|title=\u0421\u0438\u043d\u0442\u0430\u043a\u0441\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u043e\u0442 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0434\u0430\u0440\u0434\u0435\u043d \u0458\u0430\u0437\u0438\u043a|trans-title=Syntax of the standard Macedonian language|language=mk|year=1994}}</ref>\n\nThere are three different types of plural: regular, counted and [[collective noun|collective]]. The first plural type is most common and used to indicate regular plurality of nouns: ''\u043c\u0430\u0436 - \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'' (a man - men), ''\u043c\u0430\u0441\u0430 - \u043c\u0430\u0441\u0438'' (a table - table), ''\u0441\u0435\u043b\u043e - \u0441\u0435\u043b\u0430'' (a village - villages). There are various suffixes that are used and they differ per noun gender. Counted plural is used when a number or a [[quantifier]] precedes the noun; suffixes to express this type of plurality do not correspond with the regular plurality suffixes: ''\u0434\u0432\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0432\u0430'' (two pencils), ''\u0442\u0440\u0438 \u043b\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0430'' (three leaves), ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u043e\u043b\u043a\u0443 \u0447\u0430\u0441\u0430'' (several hours). The collective plural is used for nouns that can be viewed as a single unit: ''\u043b\u0438\u0441\u0458\u0435'' (a pile of leaves), ''\u0440\u0438\u0434\u0458\u0435'' (a unit of hills). Irregular plural forms also exist in the language: ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435 - \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'' (child - children).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Definiteness====\n{|class=\"wikitable floatright\"\n|-\n|+The definite articles\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" |\n!colspan=\"3\" | Singular\n!colspan=\"3\" | Plural\n|-\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n!Masculine\n!Feminine\n!Neuter\n|-\n!Unspecified\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0442''''' \n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0442\u0430''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' \n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0442\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0442\u0435''''' \n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0442\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Proximate\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u0432'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0432o'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u0432\u0435'''''\n|  ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u0432\u0430'''''\n|-\n!Distal\n| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436'''\u043e\u043d'''''\n| ''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u043do'''''\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| ''\u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''/''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438'''\u043d\u0435'''''\n| ''\u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'''\u043d\u0430'''''\n|}\n\nA characteristic feature of the nominal system is the indication of [[definiteness]]. As with other Slavic languages, there is no [[indefinite article]] in Macedonian. The [[definite article]] in Macedonian is postpositive, i.e. it is added as a suffix to nouns. An individual feature of the Macedonian language is the use of three [[definite article]]s, inflected for gender and related to the position of the object, which can be unspecified, proximate or distal.\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0432, -\u0432\u0430, -\u0432\u043e, -\u0432\u0435'' are used for objects located close to the speaker (''\u0447\u043e\u0432\u0435\u043a'''\u043e\u0432''''': - this person here)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u043d, -\u043d\u0430, -\u043d\u043e, -\u043d\u0435'' are used for objects located further away from the speaker that can still be perceived (''\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'''\u043d\u0430''''': - that woman there)\n*Definite articles ''-\u043e\u0442, -\u0442\u0430, -\u0442\u043e, -\u0442\u0435'' are most commonly used as general indicators of definiteness regardless of the referred object's position (''\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''': the child). Additionally, these suffixes can be used to indicate objects referred to by the speaker that are in the proximity of the listener, e.g. ''\u0434\u0430\u0458 \u043c\u0438 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0448\u0442\u043e \u0435 \u0434\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0431\u0435'' - give me the book next to you.<ref name=\"opsta\" />\n\n[[Proper nouns]] are per definition definite and are not usually used together with an article, although exceptions exist in the spoken and literary language such as ''\u0421\u043e\u0432\u0447\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''', ''\u041d\u0430\u0434\u0435'''\u0442\u043e''''' to demonstrate feelings of [[endearment]] to a person.\n\n===Adjectives===\nAdjectives accompany nouns and serve to provide additional information about their referents. Macedonian adjectives [[Agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify and are thus are thus inflected for gender, number and definiteness and  ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432'' changes to ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430'' (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0430 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0430'', a beautiful woman) when used to describe a feminine noun, ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e'' when used to describe a neuter noun (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u043e \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', a beautiful childd) and ''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438'' when used to form the plural (''\u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u043c\u0430\u0436\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0436\u0435\u043d\u0438, \u0443\u0431\u0430\u0432\u0438 \u0434\u0435\u0446\u0430'').<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nAdjectives can be analytically inflected for degree of [[Comparison (grammar)|comparison]] with the prefix ''\u043f\u043e-'' marking the [[comparative]] and the prefix ''\u043d\u0430\u0458-'' marking the [[superlative]].

Case relations are marked in pronouns. Personal pronouns in Macedonian appear in three genders and both in singular and plural. They can also appear either as [[accusative|direct]] or [[dative|indirect object]] in long or short forms. Depending on whether a definite direct or indirect object is used, a [[clitic pronoun]] will refer to the object with the verb: ''\u0408\u0430\u0441 \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u0443 \u0458\u0430 \u0434\u0430\u0434\u043e\u0432 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u0430 \u043c\u043e\u043c\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"I did not give the book to the boy\").<ref name=\"periods437\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|Garry|2001|page=437}}</ref> The direct object is a remnant of the accusative case and the indirect of the dative. Reflexive pronouns also have forms for both direct and indirect objects: ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0435'', ''\u0441\u0435\u0431\u0435 \u0441\u0438''.

These pronouns are inflected for gender and number and other word forms can be derived from them (''\u043d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u0458'' - nobody, ''\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0442\u043e'' - something, ''\u0441\u0435\u0447\u0438\u0458'' - everybody's). There are three groups of demonstrative pronouns that can indicate proximate (''\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0458'' - this one (mas.)), distal (''\u043e\u043d\u0430\u0430'' - the one there (fem.)) and unspecific (''\u0442\u043e\u0430'' - that one (neut.)) objects.

Macedonian verbs are conventionally divided into three main conjugations according to the [[thematic vowel]] used in the [[citation form]] (i.e. {{Smallcaps|{{lc:[[Grammatical person|3p]]-[[Present tense|pres]]-[[Grammatical number|sg]]}}}}).<ref name=\"opsta\">{{Harvnb|Bojkovska|2008|page=?}}</ref> These groups are: ''a''-group, ''e''-group and ''\u0438''-group. Furthermore, the ''\u0438''-subgroup is divided into three more subgroups: \u0430-, \u0435- and \u0438-subgroups. The verb ''\u0441\u0443\u043c'' (to be) is the only exception to the rule as it ends with a consonant. \n\nThe perfect tense can be formed using both to be (''\u0441\u0443\u043c'') and to have (''\u0438\u043c\u0430''). The first form conjugates the verb to be per person and uses a past active participle: ''\u0441\u0443\u043c \u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043b \u043c\u043d\u043e\u0433\u0443 \u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'' (\"I have seen a lot of things\"). The latter form makes use of a clitic that agrees in number and gender with the object of the sentence and the passive participle of the verb in its uninflected form (''\u0433\u043e \u0438\u043c\u0430\u043c \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u043e \u0444\u0438\u043b\u043c\u043e\u0442'', \"I have seen that movie\").<ref name=\"u107\" /><ref name=\"periods33\" /> Another past form, the aorist is used to describe actions that have finished at a given moment in the past: ''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0432'' (\"I walked\"), ''\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043a\u0430\u0430'' (\"they jumped\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nFuture forms of verbs are conjugated using the particle ''\u045c\u0435'' followed by the verb conjugated in the present tense, ''\u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will go). To express negation in the future, the construction can either be formed by adding the negation particle at the beginning ''\u043d\u0435 \u045c\u0435 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'' (I will not go) or using the construction ''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430'' (''\u043d\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u0434\u0430 \u043e\u0434\u0430\u043c'') with no difference in meaning. Another tense is the future-in-the-past tense which is formed using the clitic ''\u045c\u0435'' and a past tense of the verb conjugated for person, ''\u0442\u0430\u0430 \u045c\u0435 \u0437\u0430\u043c\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0448\u0435'' (\"she would have left\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n====Aspect, transitiveness, mood====\nSimilar to other Slavic languages, Macedonian verbs have a [[grammatical aspect]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u0432\u0438\u0434'') that is a [[Grammatical aspect in Slavic languages|typical feature of Slavic languages]]. Verbs can be divided into [[imperfective aspect|imperfective]] (''\u043d\u0435\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') and [[perfective aspect|perfective]] (''\u0441\u0432\u0440\u0448\u0435\u043d\u0438'') indicating actions whose time duration is unknown or occur repetitively or those that show an action that is finished in one moment. The former group of verbs can be subdivided into verbs which take place without interruption (e.g. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 \u0441\u043f\u0438\u0435 \u0446\u0435\u043b \u0434\u0435\u043d'', \"He sleeps all day long) or those that signify repeated actions (e.g. ''\u0408\u0430 \u0431\u0430\u0440\u0430\u0448\u0435 \u043a\u043d\u0438\u0433\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043d\u043e \u043d\u0435 \u043c\u043e\u0436\u0435\u0448\u0435 \u0434\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043d\u0430\u0458\u0434\u0435'', \"He was looking for the book but he could not find it\"). Perfective verbs are usually formed by adding prefixes to the stem of the verb, depending on which, they can express actions that took place in one moment (''\u0447\u0443\u043a\u043d\u0430'', \"knocked\"), actions that have just begun (''\u0437\u0430\u043f\u0435\u0430'', \"start to sing\"), actions that have ended (''\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430'', \"read\") or partial actions that last for short periods of time (''\u043f\u043e\u0440\u0430\u0431\u043e\u0442\u0438'', \"worked\").<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\nThe contrast between transitive and intransitive verbs can be expressed analytically or syntactically and virtually all verbs denoting actions performed by living beings can become transitive if a short personal pronoun is added: ''\u0422\u043ej \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430'' (\"He laid down\") vs. ''\u0422\u043ej \u0433\u043e \u043b\u0435\u0433\u043d\u0430 \u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435\u0442\u043e'' (\"He laid the child down\"). Additionally, verbs which are expressed with the reflexive pronoun ''\u0441\u0435'' can become transitive by using any of the contracted pronoun forms for the direct object: ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u0441\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - He is laughing, vs. ''\u0422\u043e\u0458 '''\u043c\u0435''' \u0441\u043c\u0435\u0435'' - \"He is making me laugh\"). Some verbs such as sleep or die do not traditionally have the property of being transitive.<ref name=\"u117/>\n\nMacedonian verbs have three [[grammatical moods]] (''\u0433\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u043b\u0441\u043a\u0438 \u043d\u0430\u0447\u0438\u043d''): [[indicative]], [[imperative]] and [[conditional]]. The imperative mood can express both a wish or an order to finish a certain action. The imperative only has forms for the second person and is formed using the suffixes ''-\u0458'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458''; sing) or ''-\u0438'' (''\u043e\u0434\u0438'', walk) for singular and ''-\u0458\u0442\u0435'' (''\u043f\u0435\u0458\u0442\u0435'', sing) or ''-\u0435\u0442\u0435'' for plural (''\u043e\u0434\u0435\u0442\u0435'', walk). The first and third subject forms in singular and plural express indirect orders and are conjugated using ''\u0434\u0430'' or ''\u043d\u0435\u043a\u0430'' and the verb in present tense (''\u0434\u0430 \u0436\u0438\u0432\u0435\u0435\u043c\u0435 \u0434\u043e\u043b\u0433\u043e'', may we live long). In addition to its primary functions, the imperative is used to indicate actions in the past, eternal truths as is the case in sayings and a condition. The Macedonian conditional is conjugated in the same way for all three persons using the particle ''\u0431\u0438'' and the verbal l-form,  ''\u0431\u0438 \u0447\u0438\u0442\u0430\u043b'' (I/you/he would read).<ref name=\"matura\" />\n\n===Syntax and prepositions===\nMacedonian syntax has a [[subject-verb-object]] (SVO) [[word order]] which is nevertheless flexible and can be [[tropicalization|tropicalized]].<ref name=\"gramatika\" /> For instance, the sentence ''\u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430 \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d'' (Marija loves Ivan) can become of the [[object\u2013verb\u2013subject]] (OVS) form as well, ''\u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d \u0433\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u0440\u0438\u0458\u0430''.<ref name=\"u116\">{{Harvnb|Usikova|2005|page=116}}</ref> Tropicalization can also be achieved using a combination of word order and intonation; as an example all of the following sentences give a different point of emphasis:\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the object)\n*''\u041c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u0458\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the subject)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on both the subject and the verb)\n*''\u0408\u0430 \u043a\u0430\u0441\u0430 \u043c\u0430\u0447\u043a\u0430\u0442\u0430 \u043a\u0443\u0447\u0435\u0442\u043e.'' \u2013 The dog bites the cat (the focus is on the verb and the object)<ref name=\"Friedman50\">{{Harvnb|Friedman|2001|p=50}}</ref>\n\nMacedonian is a [[null-subject language]] which means that the subject pronoun can be omitted, for instance ''\u0428\u0442\u043e \u0441\u0430\u043a\u0430\u0448 (\u0442\u0438)?''

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition.

With Asimov's collaboration, in about 1977, [[Harlan Ellison]] wrote a screenplay of ''I, Robot'' that Asimov hoped would lead to \"the first really adult, complex, worthwhile [[science fiction film]] ever made\". The screenplay has never been filmed and was eventually published in book form in 1994.

Chemists, he noted, will read the word \"unionized\" as ''un''-''ion-ized'' (pronounced \"un-EYE-en-ized\"), meaning \"(a chemical species) being in an electrically neutral state, as opposed to being an ion\", while non-chemists will read the word as ''union-ized'' (pronounced \"YOU-nien-ized\"), meaning \"(a worker or organization) belonging to or possessing a trade union\".\n\n=== Coined terms ===\nAsimov coined the term \"[[robotics]]\" in his 1941 story \"[[Liar!

While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1942 printing of his short story \"[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Gold |publisher=Voyager <!-- was Eos --> |date=1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=0-00-648202-3 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Counting the Eons |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |date=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented ... the word|title-link=Counting the Eons }}</ref>\n\nIn the same story, Asimov also coined the term \"positronic\" (the counterpart to \"electronic\" for [[positron]]s).<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/positronic Oxford Dictionary website] entry for \"positronic\"</ref>\n\nAsimov coined the term \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" in his [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. Asimov said later that he should have called it psychosociology. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942\u20131944) which would later be collected as the 1951 [[fix-up]] novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4\u20138 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}</ref> Somewhat later, the term \"[[psychohistory]]\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\n=== Other writings ===\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970),{{efn|Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (1980), pp. 464\u2013465: \"Of all the books I have ever worked on, I think ''Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare'' gave me the most pleasure, day in, day out.

Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112</ref>\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book|title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/asimovlaughsagai00isaa }}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by \"J\") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by \"M\"), Asimov published ''[[The Sensuous Dirty Old Man]]'' under the byline \"Dr. 'A{{'\"}}<ref>''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569</ref> (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972).

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A\u2013D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter).

I'll write as I please and let the critics do the analyzing.|Asimov, 1973{{r|asimov1973}}}}\n\n=== Characteristics ===\nAsimov was his own secretary, typist, [[index (publishing)|index]]er, [[proofreader]], and [[literary agent]].{{r|nichols19690803}} He wrote a typed first draft composed at the keyboard at 90 words per minute; he imagined an ending first, then a beginning, then \"let everything in-between work itself out as I come to it\". (Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

During his childhood, his father and mother observed [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] traditions, though not as stringently as they had in Petrovichi; they did not, however, force their beliefs upon young Isaac. Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I. Asimov: A Memoir |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=Bantam |location=New York |isbn=0-553-56997-X |pages=11\u201314}}</ref> When he was 13, he chose not to have a [[bar mitzvah]].<ref>''In Memory Yet Green'', p. 121</ref> As his books ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' and ''Asimov Laughs Again'' record, Asimov was willing to tell jokes involving God, [[Satan]], the [[Garden of Eden]], [[Jerusalem]], and other religious topics, expressing the viewpoint that a good joke can do more to provoke thought than hours of philosophical discussion.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\"/><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\"/>\n\nFor a brief while, his father worked in the local synagogue to enjoy the familiar surroundings and, as Isaac put it, \"shine as a learned scholar\"<ref>Asimov, Isaac. ''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920\u20131954''. Doubleday, 1979.</ref> versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref>\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,\n\n{{quote|I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have. Somehow it was better to say one was a humanist or an agnostic. I finally decided that I'm a creature of emotion as well as of reason. Emotionally I am an atheist.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

Then too, it is impossible to write science fiction and really ignore religion.<ref>{{cite book |first=Isaac |last=Asimov |title=Gold: The Final Science Fiction Collection |year=1995 |pages=297\u2013302}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Politics ===\nAsimov became a staunch supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] during the [[New Deal]], and thereafter remained a political [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]. He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign. Asimov was dismayed over the pardon extended to Nixon by [[Gerald Ford|his successor]]: \"I was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal. To my way of thinking, the ordeal was necessary to make certain it would never happen again.\"<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Doubleday, 1980) chapter 39</ref>\n\nAfter Asimov's name appeared in the mid-1960s on a list of people the [[Communist Party USA]] \"considered amenable\" to its goals, the [[FBI]] investigated him. Because of his academic background, the bureau briefly considered Asimov as a possible candidate for known Soviet spy ROBPROF, but found nothing suspicious in his life or background.<ref name=\"skelding20131107\">{{cite web |url=https://www.muckrock.com/news/archives/2013/nov/07/isaac-asimov-fbi-file-ROBPROF/ |title=\"Inimical to the best interests of the United States.\" Isaac Asimov's FBI File |last=Skelding |first=Conor |website=MuckRock |date=November 7, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThough from a Jewish family, Asimov appeared to hold an equivocal attitude towards [[Israel]]. In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

Actually, I feel that no human group deserves a \"homeland\" in the usual sense of the word. ... I am not a Zionist, then, because I don't believe in nations, and Zionism merely sets up one more nation to trouble the world.}}}}\n\n=== Social issues ===\nAsimov believed that \"''science'' fiction ... serve[s] the good of humanity\".{{r|asimov196708}} He considered himself a feminist even before [[women's liberation]] became a widespread movement; he argued that the issue of [[women's rights]] was closely connected to that of population control.<ref name=\"YIA\" /> Furthermore, he believed that [[homosexuality]] must be considered a \"moral right\" on population grounds, as must all consenting adult sexual activity that does not lead to reproduction.<ref name=\"YIA\" /> He issued many appeals for [[population control]], reflecting a perspective articulated by people from [[Thomas Malthus]] through [[Paul R. Ehrlich]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part I |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov1.pdf |work=transcript page 6, 10/17/1988 show |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn a 1988 interview by [[Bill Moyers]], Asimov proposed [[computer-aided learning]], where people would use computers to find information on subjects in which they were interested.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bill Moyer's World of Ideas, Part II |url=https://www.pbs.org/moyers/faithandreason/print/pdfs/woi%20asimov2.pdf |work=transcript page 3, 10/17/1988 show |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref> He thought this would make learning more interesting, since people would have the freedom to choose what to learn, and would help spread knowledge around the world.

In a letter reprinted in ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'',<ref name=\"YIA\">Asimov, Isaac (1996). ''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing. You have to set up, you have to set up times for each person, you have to bang at the door, aren't you through yet, and so on. And in the same way, democracy cannot survive overpopulation. Human dignity cannot survive it. Convenience and decency cannot survive it.

R. R. Tolkien]], using ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' as a plot point in a [[Black Widowers]] story.<ref name=\"asimov1976\">{{Cite book|title=More Tales of the Black Widowers |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1976 |isbn=0-385-11176-2 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/moretalesofblack00asim/page/62 62\u201376] |chapter=Nothing Like Murder |chapter-url=https://archive.org/stream/moretalesofblack00asim#page/62/mode/2up |url=https://archive.org/details/moretalesofblack00asim/page/62 }}</ref> (Tolkien said that he enjoyed Asimov's science fiction.<ref>{{ME-ref|Letters|No. 294}}</ref>) He acknowledged other writers as superior to himself in talent, saying of [[Harlan Ellison]], \"He is (in my opinion) one of the best writers in the world, far more skilled at the art than I am.\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' p. 246</ref> Asimov disapproved of the [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]]'s growing influence, however, stating in 1967 \"I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model. In my opinion, her mysteries are the best ever written, far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories, and [[Hercule Poirot]] is the best detective fiction has seen. Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 379</ref> He enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, but considered [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to be \"a slapdash and sloppy writer.\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 391</ref>\n\nAsimov also enjoyed humorous stories, particularly those of [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref>Asimov (1979) ''In Memory Yet Green'' p. 90</ref>\n\nIn non-fiction writing, Asimov particularly admired the writing style of [[Martin Gardner]], and tried to emulate it in his own science books. On meeting Gardner for the first time in 1965, Asimov told him this, to which Gardner answered that he had based his own style on Asimov's.<ref>Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1980) p. 369</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n[[Paul Krugman]], holder of a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]], has stated Asimov's concept of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] inspired him to become an economist.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/who-are-you-calling-dense/ |title=The Conscience of a Liberal, 'Who Are You Calling Dense?' |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |last=Krugman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman |work=The New York Times |date=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nJohn Jenkins, who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov's written output, once observed, \"It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/NonAsimov/White.html |title=Review of an Asimov biography, 'The Unauthorized Life' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> Along with such figures as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Karl Popper]], Asimov left his mark as one of the most distinguished [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinarians]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|title=Ten Cheers for Interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=http://drnissani.net/mnissani/pagepub/10CHEERS.HTM|journal=Social Science Journal |date=1997 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=201\u2013216 |doi=10.1016/s0362-3319(97)90051-3}}</ref> \"Few individuals\", writes [[Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering|James L.

His early career, dominated by science fiction, began with short stories in 1939 and novels in 1950. This lasted until about 1958, all but ending after publication of ''[[The Naked Sun]]'' (1957). He began publishing nonfiction as co-author of a college-level textbook called ''Biochemistry and Human Metabolism''. Following the brief orbit of the first man-made satellite [[Sputnik I]] by the USSR in 1957, his production of nonfiction, particularly [[popular science]] books, greatly increased, with a consequent drop in his science fiction output. Over the next quarter century, he wrote only four science fiction novels, while writing over 120 nonfiction books. Starting in 1982, the second half of his science fiction career began with the publication of ''[[Foundation's Edge]]''. From then until his death, Asimov published several more sequels and prequels to his existing novels, tying them together in a way he had not originally anticipated, making a unified series. There are, however, many inconsistencies in this unification, especially in his earlier stories.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Prelude to Foundation |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1988 |pages=xiii\u2013xv |nopp=true }}</ref> [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and [[Houghton Mifflin]] published about 60% of his work as of 1969, Asimov stating that \"both represent a father image\".{{r|nichols19690803}}\n\nAsimov believed his most enduring contributions would be his \"[[Three Laws of Robotics]]\" and the [[Foundation Series|''Foundation'' series]].<ref>''Yours, Isaac Asimov,'' p.&nbsp;329</ref> Furthermore, the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' credits his science fiction for introducing into the English language the words \"[[robotics]]\", \"[[positronic brain|positronic]]\" (an entirely fictional technology), and \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" (which is also used for a [[Psychohistory|different study]] on historical motivations). Asimov coined the term \"robotics\" without suspecting that it might be an original word; at the time, he believed it was simply the natural analogue of words such as [[mechanics]] and [[hydraulics]], but for [[robot]]s. Unlike his word \"psychohistory\", the word \"robotics\" continues in mainstream technical use with Asimov's original definition. ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' featured [[android (robot)|androids]] with \"[[positronic brain]]s\" and the first-season episode \"[[Datalore]]\" called the positronic brain \"Asimov's dream\".<ref>{{cite web |last=Seiler |first=Edward |last2=Hatcher |first2=Richard |url=http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#series12 |title=Is Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation an Asimovian robot? |publisher=Isaac Asimov Home Page |date=2014 |accessdate=August 3, 2016}}</ref>\n\n=== Science fiction ===\n{{quote|No matter how various the subject matter I write on, I was a science-fiction writer first and it is as a science-fiction writer that I want to be identified.|Asimov, 1980<ref>{{Cite book |title=In Joy Still Felt|last= Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Avon |year=1980 |location= New York|pages= 286-287}}</ref>}}\n\n[[File:GXY5101 0000fc.jpg|thumb|right|The first installment of Asimov's ''Tyrann'' was the cover story in the fourth issue of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' in 1951.

In May 1937 he first thought of writing professionally, and began writing his first science fiction story, \"Cosmic Corkscrew\" (now lost), that year. On May 17, 1938, puzzled by a change in the schedule of ''[[Astounding Science Fiction]]'', Asimov visited its publisher [[Street & Smith Publications]]. Inspired by the visit, he finished the story on June 19, 1938 and personally submitted it to ''Astounding'' editor [[John W. Campbell]] two days later. Campbell met with Asimov for more than an hour and promised to read the story himself. Two days later he received a rejection letter explaining why in detail.{{r|earlyyears1_9}} This was the first of what became almost weekly meetings with the editor while Asimov lived in New York, until moving to Boston in 1949;{{r|earlyyears560_564}} Campbell had a strong formative influence on Asimov and became a personal friend.<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location=[[Oxford, England]] |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 12\u201313, 20] |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn/page/12 }}</ref>\n\nBy the end of the month Asimov completed a second story, \"[[The Callistan Menace|Stowaway]]\".

The band and their impostors would likely be played by McCartney's group [[Wings (band)|Wings]], then at the height of their career.

While acknowledging the Oxford Dictionary reference, he incorrectly states that the word was first printed about one-third of the way down the first column of page 100, ''[[Analog Science Fiction and Fact|Astounding Science Fiction]]'', March 1942 printing of his short story \"[[Runaround (story)|Runaround]]\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Gold |publisher=Voyager <!-- was Eos --> |date=1996 <!-- was 2003 --> |origyear=1995 |location=London |isbn=0-00-648202-3 |pages=224\u2013225 |chapter=The Robot Chronicles}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |title=Counting the Eons |chapter=4 The Word I Invented |publisher=Doubleday |date=1983 |quote=Robotics has become a sufficiently well developed technology to warrant articles and books on its history and I have watched this in amazement, and in some disbelief, because I invented ... the word|title-link=Counting the Eons }}</ref>\n\nIn the same story, Asimov also coined the term \"positronic\" (the counterpart to \"electronic\" for [[positron]]s).<ref>[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/positronic Oxford Dictionary website] entry for \"positronic\"</ref>\n\nAsimov coined the term \"[[psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]]\" in his [[Foundation series|''Foundation'']] stories to name a fictional branch of science which combines [[history]], [[sociology]], and [[mathematical statistics]] to make general predictions about the future behavior of very large groups of people, such as the [[Galactic Empire (Asimov)|Galactic Empire]]. Asimov said later that he should have called it psychosociology. It was first introduced in the five short stories (1942\u20131944) which would later be collected as the 1951 [[fix-up]] novel ''[[Foundation (Isaac Asimov novel)|Foundation]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Psychohistory |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction |volume=12 |issue=7 |pages=4\u20138 |publisher=Davis Publications |date=July 1988 |issn=0162-2188}}</ref> Somewhat later, the term \"[[psychohistory]]\" was applied by others to research of the effects of psychology on history.\n\n=== Other writings ===\nIn addition to his interest in science, Asimov was interested in history. Starting in the 1960s, he wrote 14 popular history books, including ''The Greeks: A Great Adventure'' (1965),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Greeks: A Great Adventure |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1965 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Republic'' (1966),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Republic |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1966 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Roman Empire'' (1967),<ref>{{cite book |title=The Roman Empire |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Egyptians'' (1967)<ref>{{cite book |title=The Egyptians |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1967 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> ''The Near East: 10,000 Years of History'' (1968),\n<ref>{{cite book |title=The Near East: 10,000 Years of History |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1968 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=Boston}}</ref> and ''[[Asimov's Chronology of the World]]'' (1991).<ref>{{cite book |title=Asimov's Chronology of the World |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1991 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nHe published ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'' in two volumes\u2014covering the [[Old Testament]] in 1967 and the [[New Testament]] in 1969\u2014and then combined them into one 1,300-page volume in 1981. Complete with maps and tables, the guide goes through the books of the Bible in order, explaining the history of each one and the political influences that affected it, as well as biographical information about the important characters. His interest in literature manifested itself in several annotations of literary works, including ''[[Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare]]'' (1970),{{efn|Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (1980), pp. 464\u2013465: \"Of all the books I have ever worked on, I think ''Asimov's Guide to Shakespeare'' gave me the most pleasure, day in, day out. For months and months I lived and thought Shakespeare, and I don't see how there can be any greater pleasure in the world\u2014any pleasure, that is, that one can indulge in for as much as ten hours without pause, day after day indefinitely.\"}} ''Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost'' (1974), and ''The Annotated Gulliver's Travels'' (1980).<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' chapter 112</ref>\n\nAsimov was also a noted mystery author and a frequent contributor to ''Ellery Queen's Mystery Magazine''. He began by writing science fiction mysteries such as his Wendell Urth stories, but soon moved on to writing \"pure\" mysteries. He published two full-length mystery novels, and wrote 66 stories about the [[Black Widowers]], a group of men who met monthly for dinner, conversation, and a puzzle. He got the idea for the Widowers from his own association in a stag group called the Trap Door Spiders and all of the main characters (with the exception of the waiter, Henry, who he admitted resembled Wodehouse's Jeeves) were modeled after his closest friends.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Puzzles of the Black Widowers |publisher=Bantam Books |date=1991 |pages=xiii |nopp=true }}</ref>\n\nToward the end of his life, Asimov published a series of collections of [[limerick (poetry)|limericks]], mostly written by himself, starting with ''[[Lecherous Limericks]]'', which appeared in 1975. ''Limericks: Too Gross'', whose title displays Asimov's love of [[pun]]s, contains 144 limericks by Asimov and an equal number by [[John Ciardi]]. He even created a slim volume of [[Sherlock Holmes|Sherlockian]] limericks. Asimov featured [[Yiddish]] humor in ''[[Azazel (Asimov)|Azazel, The Two Centimeter Demon]]''. The two main characters, both Jewish, talk over dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, about anecdotes of \"George\" and his friend Azazel. Asimov's ''[[Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor|Treasury of Humor]]'' is both a working joke book and a treatise propounding his views on [[Theory of humor|humor theory]]. According to Asimov, the most essential element of humor is an abrupt change in point of view, one that suddenly shifts focus from the important to the trivial, or from the sublime to the ridiculous.<ref name=\"Asimov 1971\">{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov's Treasury of Humor |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1971 |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |location=New York |isbn=0-395-12665-7}}</ref><ref name=\"Asimov 1992\">{{cite book|title=Asimov Laughs Again |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1992 |publisher=HarperCollins |location=London |isbn=0-06-016826-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/asimovlaughsagai00isaa }}</ref>\n\nParticularly in his later years, Asimov to some extent cultivated an image of himself as an amiable lecher. In 1971, as a response to the popularity of sexual guidebooks such as ''[[The Sensuous Woman]]'' (by \"J\") and ''[[The Sensuous Man]]'' (by \"M\"), Asimov published ''[[The Sensuous Dirty Old Man]]'' under the byline \"Dr. 'A{{'\"}}<ref>''In Joy Still Felt'' p. 569</ref> (although his full name was printed on the paperback edition, first published 1972). However, by 2016, some of Asimov's behavior towards women was described as [[sexual harassment]] and cited as an example of historically problematic behavior by men in science fiction communities.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://io9.gizmodo.com/dont-look-away-fighting-sexual-harassment-in-the-scifi-1785704207|title=Don't Look Away: Fighting Sexual Harassment in the Scifi/Fantasy Community|last=Hines|first=Jim C.|date=August 29, 2016|work=io9|access-date=December 18, 2017|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAsimov published [[Autobiographies of Isaac Asimov|three volumes of autobiography]].

The epilogue was written by his widow [[Janet Asimov]] after his death.

In it they offer advice on how to maintain a positive attitude and stay productive when dealing with discouragement, distractions, rejection, and thick-headed editors. The book includes many quotations, essays, anecdotes, and husband-wife dialogues about the ups and downs of being an author.<ref>{{cite book|title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |last=Asimov |first=Janet |authorlink=Janet Asimov |last2=Asimov |first2=Isaac |date=1987 |publisher=Walker & Co. |location=New York |isbn=0-8027-0945-1 |url=https://archive.org/details/howtoenjoywritin00asim_0 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book362.html |title=How to Enjoy Writing: A Book of Aid and Comfort |publisher=John H.

Asimov wrote a critical essay on ''Star Trek''{{'}}s scientific accuracy for ''[[TV Guide]]'' magazine. Roddenberry retorted respectfully with a personal letter explaining the limitations of accuracy when writing a weekly series. Asimov corrected himself with a follow-up essay to ''TV Guide'' claiming that despite its inaccuracies, ''Star Trek'' was a fresh and intellectually challenging [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] show. The two remained friends to the point where Asimov even served as an advisor on a number of ''Star Trek'' projects.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/06/getting-star-trek-on-air-was-impossible.html |title=Letters of Note: Getting Star Trek on the air was impossible |publisher=}}</ref>\n\n{{anchor|Calendar}}\nIn 1973, Asimov published a proposal for [[calendar reform]], called the World Season Calendar. It divides the year into four seasons (named A\u2013D) of 13 weeks (91 days) each. This allows days to be named, e.g., \"D-73\" instead of December 1 (due to December 1 being the 73rd day of the 4th quarter). An extra 'year day' is added for a total of 365 days.<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |authorlink=Isaac Asimov |chapter=The Week Excuse |title=The Tragedy of the Moon |pages=48\u201358 |publisher=Doubleday and Co |date=1973 |isbn=0-440-18999-3|title-link=The Tragedy of the Moon }}</ref>\n\n=== Awards and recognition ===\nAsimov won more than a dozen annual awards for particular works of science fiction and a half dozen lifetime awards.<ref name=SFAwards>[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html#179 \"Asimov, Isaac\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016200502/http://locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit5.html |date=October 16, 2012 }}.

(Asimov only used an [[outline (list)|outline]] once, later describing it as \"like trying to play the piano from inside a straitjacket\".) After correcting the draft by hand, he retyped the document as the final copy and only made one revision with minor editor-requested changes; a [[word processor]] did not save him much time, Asimov said, because 95% of the first draft was unchanged.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\"/><ref name=\"fallows198207\">{{Cite magazine |last=Fallows |first=James |date=July 1982 |title=Living With a Computer |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1982/07/living-with-a-computer/306063/ |magazine=The Atlantic |language=en-US |access-date=March 17, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAfter disliking making multiple revisions of \"[[Black Friar of the Flame]]\", Asimov refused to make major, second, or non-editorial revisions (\"like chewing used gum\"), stating that \"too large a revision, or too many revisions, indicate that the piece of writing is a failure. In the time it would take to salvage such a failure, I could write a new piece altogether and have infinitely more fun in the process\". He submitted \"failures\" to another editor.{{r|asimov1973}}<ref name=\"earlyyears142_145\">{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/earlyasimovorele00asim#page/142/mode/2up |title=The Early Asimov; or, Eleven Years of Trying |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |publisher=Doubleday |year=1972 |location=Garden City, NY |pages=142\u2013145}}</ref>\n\nOne of the most common impressions of Asimov's fiction work is that his writing style is extremely unornamented. In 1980, science fiction scholar [[James Gunn (author)|James Gunn]], professor [[emeritus]] of [[English studies|English]] at the [[University of Kansas]] wrote of ''I, Robot'':\n\n{{quote|Except for two stories\u2014\"[[Liar! (short story)|Liar!]]\" and \"[[Evidence (Asimov)|Evidence]]\"\u2014they are not stories in which character plays a significant part. Virtually all plot develops in conversation with little if any action. Nor is there a great deal of local color or description of any kind. The dialogue is, at best, functional and the style is, at best, transparent. ... . The robot stories and, as a matter of fact, almost all Asimov fiction\u2014play themselves on a relatively bare stage.<ref name=\"IASFM-Gunn\">{{cite magazine |last=Gunn |first=James | author-link = James Gunn (author) |title=On Variations on a Robot |magazine=Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine |date=July 1980 |pages=56\u201381 }}</ref>}}\n\nAsimov addressed such criticism at the beginning of ''[[Nemesis (Isaac Asimov novel)|Nemesis]]'':\n\n{{quote|I made up my mind long ago to follow one cardinal rule in all my writing\u2014to be 'clear'. I have given up all thought of writing poetically or symbolically or experimentally, or in any of the other modes that might (if I were good enough) get me a Pulitzer prize. I would write merely clearly and in this way establish a warm relationship between myself and my readers, and the professional critics\u2014Well, they can do whatever they wish.<ref name=\"Nemesis-Authour's note\">{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=Nemesis |date=October 1989 }}</ref>}}\n\nGunn cited examples of a more complex style, such as the climax of \"Liar!\". Sharply drawn characters occur at key junctures of his storylines: [[Susan Calvin]] in \"Liar!\" and \"Evidence\", [[Arkady Darell]] in ''Second Foundation'', Elijah Baley in ''[[The Caves of Steel]]'', and [[Hari Seldon]] in the ''Foundation'' prequels.\n\nOther than books by Gunn and Patrouch, a relative dearth of \"literary\" criticism exists on Asimov (particularly when compared to the sheer volume of his output). Cowart and Wymer's ''[[Dictionary of Literary Biography]]'' (1981) gives a possible reason:\n\n{{quote|His words do not easily lend themselves to traditional [[literary criticism]] because he has the habit of centering his fiction on plot and clearly stating to his reader, in rather direct terms, what is happening in his stories and why it is happening. In fact, most of the dialogue in an Asimov story, and particularly in the Foundation trilogy, is devoted to such exposition. Stories that clearly state what they mean in unambiguous language are the most difficult for a scholar to deal with because there is little to be interpreted.<ref>{{cite book |title=Dictionary of Literary Biography: Volume 8: Twentieth-Century American Science Fiction Writers |last=Cowart |first=David |last2=Wymer |first2=Thomas L. |date=1981 |publisher=Gale Research |location=Detroit |pages=15\u201329}}</ref>}}\n\nGunn's and Patrouch's respective studies of Asimov both state that a clear, direct prose style is still a style. Gunn's 1982 book comments in detail on each of Asimov's novels. He does not praise all of Asimov's fiction (nor does Patrouch), but calls some passages in ''The Caves of Steel'' \"reminiscent of [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]\". When discussing how that novel depicts night falling over futuristic New York City, Gunn says that Asimov's prose \"need not be ashamed anywhere in literary society\".<ref>{{cite book |title=Isaac Asimov: The Foundations of Science Fiction |last=Gunn |first=James |authorlink=James Gunn (author) |date=1982 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-503059-1 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isaacasimovfound00gunn }}</ref>\n\nAlthough he prided himself on his unornamented prose style (for which he credited [[Clifford D. Simak]] as an early influence{{r|earlyyears79_82}}<ref>''Beyond the Golden Age'' pp. 222\u2013223</ref>), and said in 1973 that his style had not changed,{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov also enjoyed giving his longer stories complicated [[narrative structure]]s, often by arranging chapters in non[[Chronology|chronological]] ways. Some readers have been put off by this, complaining that the [[Nonlinear (arts)|nonlinearity]] is not worth the trouble and adversely affects the clarity of the story. For example, the first third of ''The Gods Themselves'' begins with Chapter 6, then backtracks to fill in earlier material.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/Books/Book121.html |title=Review of ''The Gods Themselves'' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> (John Campbell advised Asimov to begin his stories as late in the plot as possible. This advice helped Asimov create \"[[Reason (Asimov)|Reason]]\", one of the early ''Robot'' stories). Patrouch found that the interwoven and nested flashbacks of ''[[The Currents of Space]]'' did serious harm to that novel, to such an extent that only a \"dyed-in-the-[[kyrt]]<ref>Asimov, Isaac (1952), [http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/a/isaac-asimov/currents-of-space.htm ''The Currents of Space''], explanation of \"kyrt\"</ref> Asimov fan\" could enjoy it. In his later novel ''Nemesis'' one group of characters lives in the \"present\" and another group starts in the \"past\", beginning 15 years earlier and gradually moving toward the time period of the first group.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n=== Limitations ===\n==== Sexuality ====\nAsimov attributed the lack of romance and sex in his fiction to the \"early imprinting\" from starting his writing career when he had never been on a date and \"didn't know anything about girls\".{{r|earlyyears25_28}} He was sometimes criticized for the general absence of sex (and of [[extraterrestrial life]]) in his science fiction. He claimed he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' to respond to these criticisms,<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Joy Still Felt |date=1980 |page=567}}</ref> which often came from [[New Wave science fiction]] (and often British) writers. The second part (of three) of the novel is set on an alien world with three sexes, and the sexual behavior of these creatures is extensively depicted.\n\n==== Alien life ====\nAsimov once explained that his reluctance to write about aliens came from an incident early in his career when ''Astounding''{{'}}s editor John Campbell rejected one of his science fiction stories because the alien characters were portrayed as superior to the humans. The nature of the rejection led him to believe that Campbell may have based his bias towards humans in stories on a real-world racial bias. Unwilling to write only weak alien races, and concerned that a confrontation would jeopardize his and Campbell's friendship, he decided he would not write about aliens at all.<ref name=\"Early Asimov\" /> Nevertheless, in response to these criticisms, he wrote ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'', which contains aliens and alien sex. The book won the [[Nebula Award for Best Novel]] in 1972,<ref name=\"WWE\" /> and the [[Hugo Award for Best Novel]] in 1973.<ref name=\"WWE\" /> Asimov said that of all his writings, he was most proud of the middle section of ''The Gods Themselves'', the part that deals with those themes.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=250}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Hugo Award]]-winning novelette \"[[Gold (Asimov short story)|Gold]]\", Asimov describes an author, clearly based on himself, who has one of his books (''The Gods Themselves'') adapted into a \"compu-drama\", essentially [[photo-realistic]] [[computer animation]]. The director criticizes the fictionalized Asimov (\"Gregory Laborian\") for having an extremely nonvisual style, making it difficult to adapt his work, and the author explains that he relies on ideas and dialogue rather than description to get his points across.<ref>{{cite book|title=Gold |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1995 |publisher=HarperPrism |location=New York |isbn=0-06-105206-X |pages=[https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 109\u2013138] |url=https://archive.org/details/goldfinalscience00asim/page/109 }}</ref>\n\n==== Portrayal of women ====\nAsimov was criticized for a lack of strong female characters in his early work. In his autobiographical writings, such as ''[[Gold (Asimov)|Gold]]'' (\"Women and Science Fiction\"), he acknowledges this and responds by pointing to inexperience. His later novels, written with more female characters but in essentially the same prose style as his early science-fiction stories, brought this matter to a wider audience. For example, the August 25, 1985 ''Washington Post''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s \"Book World\" section reports of ''Robots and Empire'' as follows:\n\n{{quote|In 1940, Asimov's humans were stripped-down masculine portraits of Americans from 1940, and they still are. His robots were tin cans with speedlines like an old [[Studebaker]], and still are; the ''Robot'' tales depended on an increasingly unworkable distinction between movable and unmovable [[artificial intelligence]]s, and still do. In the Asimov universe, because it was conceived a long time ago, and because its author abhors confusion, there are no computers whose impact is worth noting, no social complexities, no [[genetic engineering]], aliens, [[arcologies]], [[multiverses]], [[Clone (genetics)|clones]], sin or sex; his heroes (in this case [[R. Daneel Olivaw]], whom we first met as the robot protagonist of ''The Caves of Steel'' and its sequels), feel no pressure of information, raw or cooked, as the simplest of us do today; they suffer no deformation from the winds of the Asimov future, because it is so deeply and strikingly orderly.}}\n\nHowever, some of his robot stories, including the earliest ones, featured the character [[Susan Calvin]], a forceful and intelligent woman who regularly out-performed her male colleagues.<ref>Asimov (1983) ''The Complete Robot'', Grafton Books, p. 327</ref>\n\n== Views ==\n{{quote|There is a perennial question among readers as to whether the views contained in a story reflect the views of the author.

Thus, he grew up without strong religious influences, coming to believe that the ''[[Torah]]'' represented [[Jewish mythology|Hebrew mythology]] in the same way that the ''[[Iliad]]'' recorded [[Greek mythology]].<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

''In Memory Yet Green: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1920\u20131954''. Doubleday, 1979.</ref> versed in the sacred writings. This scholarship was a seed for his later authorship and publication of ''[[Asimov's Guide to the Bible]]'', an analysis of the historic foundations for both the Old and New Testaments. For many years, Asimov called himself an [[atheism|atheist]]; however, he considered the term somewhat inadequate, as it described what he did not believe rather than what he did. Eventually, he described himself as a \"[[Humanism|humanist]]\" and considered that term more practical. He did, however, continue to identify himself as a nonobservant Jew, as stated in his introduction to [[Jack Dann]]'s anthology of Jewish science fiction, ''[[Wandering Stars]]'': \"I attend no services and follow no ritual and have never undergone that curious puberty rite, the [[bar mitzvah]]. It doesn't matter. I am Jewish.\"<ref>\"I make no secret of the fact that I am a non-observant Jew\", Asimov, Isaac. ''Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine'', Volume 15, Issues 10\u201313. p. 8. Davis Publishing, 1991.</ref>\n\nWhen asked in an interview in 1982 if he was an atheist, Asimov replied,\n\n{{quote|I am an atheist, out and out. It took me a long time to say it. I've been an atheist for years and years, but somehow I felt it was intellectually unrespectable to say one was an atheist, because it assumed knowledge that one didn't have.

Asimov rejected the idea that a human belief or action could merit infinite punishment. If an afterlife existed, he claimed, the longest and most severe punishment would be reserved for those who \"slandered God by inventing Hell\".<ref>{{cite book |title=I.

He was a vocal opponent of the [[Vietnam War]] in the 1960s and in a television interview during the early 1970s he publicly endorsed [[George McGovern]].<ref>Asimov, I. ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1981) p. 503</ref> He was unhappy about what he considered an \"irrationalist\" viewpoint taken by many radical political activists from the late 1960s and onwards. In his second volume of autobiography, ''In Joy Still Felt'', Asimov recalled meeting the counterculture figure [[Abbie Hoffman]]. Asimov's impression was that the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s' counterculture]] heroes had ridden an emotional wave which, in the end, left them stranded in a \"no-man's land of the spirit\" from which he wondered if they would ever return.<ref name=\"joy\">{{cite book|title=In Joy Still Felt: The Autobiography of Isaac Asimov, 1954\u20131978 |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |date=1980 |publisher=Doubleday |location=Garden City, NY|isbn=0-385-15544-1 |page=[https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 574] |url=https://archive.org/details/injoystillfelt00isaa/page/574 }}</ref>\n\nAsimov vehemently opposed [[Richard Nixon]], considering him \"a crook and a liar\". He closely followed [[Watergate]], and was pleased when the president was forced to resign. Asimov was dismayed over the pardon extended to Nixon by [[Gerald Ford|his successor]]: \"I was not impressed by the argument that it has spared the nation an ordeal.

In his first autobiography, he indicates his support for the safety of Israel, though insisting that he was not a [[Zionist]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=In Memory Yet Green |quote=<!--None-->}}</ref> In his third autobiography, Asimov stated his opposition to the creation of a Jewish state, on the grounds that he was opposed to the concept of nation-states in general, and supported the notion of a single humanity. Asimov especially worried about the safety of Israel given that it had been created among hostile neighbors, and said that Jews had merely created for themselves another \"Jewish ghetto\".{{efn|{{cite journal |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |title=I, Asimov: A Memoir |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |date=1994 |page=380 |quote=When Israel was founded in 1948 and all my Jewish friends were jubilant, I was the skeleton at the feast.

''Yours, Isaac Asimov'', edited by Stanley Asimov. {{ISBN|0-385-47624-8}}.</ref> he states that although he would prefer living in \"no danger whatsoever\" than near a nuclear reactor, he would still prefer a home near a nuclear power plant than in a slum on [[Love Canal]] or near \"a [[Union Carbide]] plant producing [[methyl isocyanate]]\", the latter being a reference to the [[Bhopal disaster]].<ref name=\"YIA\"/>\n\nIn the closing years of his life, Asimov blamed the deterioration of the quality of life that he perceived in New York City on the shrinking tax base caused by the [[white flight|middle-class flight]] to the suburbs, though he continued to support high taxes on the middle class to pay for social programs. His last nonfiction book, ''[[Our Angry Earth]]'' (1991, co-written with his long-time friend, science fiction author [[Frederik Pohl]]), deals with elements of the environmental crisis such as [[human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[oil dependence]], [[war]], [[global warming]], and the destruction of the [[ozone layer]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Our Angry Earth |last=Asimov |first=Isaac |last2=Pohl |first2=Frederik |date=1991 |publisher=Tor |location=New York |isbn=0-312-85252-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/ourangryearth0000asim }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last=Chow |first=Dan |date=December 1991 |title=Review: Our Angry Earth |magazine=Locus |location=Oakland |publisher=Locus Publications}}</ref> In response to being presented by [[Bill Moyers]] with the question \"What do you see happening to the idea of dignity to human species if this population growth continues at its present rate?\", Asimov responded:\n\n{{quote|It's going to destroy it all ... if you have 20 people in the apartment and two bathrooms, no matter how much every person believes in freedom of the bathroom, there is no such thing.

Asimov: A Memoir'' p. 246</ref> Asimov disapproved of the [[New Wave science fiction|New Wave]]'s growing influence, however, stating in 1967 \"I want science fiction. I think science fiction isn't really science fiction if it lacks science. And I think the better and truer the science, the better and truer the science fiction\".{{r|asimov196708}}\n\nThe feelings of friendship and respect between Asimov and [[Arthur C. Clarke]] were demonstrated by the so-called \"Clarke-Asimov Treaty of [[Park Avenue]]\", negotiated as they shared a cab in New York. This stated that Asimov was required to insist that Clarke was the best science fiction writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself), while Clarke was required to insist that Asimov was the best science writer in the world (reserving second-best for himself). Thus, the dedication in Clarke's book ''Report on Planet Three'' (1972) reads: \"In accordance with the terms of the Clarke-Asimov treaty, the second-best science writer dedicates this book to the second-best science-fiction writer.\"\n\nAsimov became a fan of mystery stories at the same time as science fiction. He preferred to read the former to latter because \"I read every [science fiction] story keenly aware that it might be worse than mine, in which case I had no patience with it, or that it might be better, in which case I felt miserable\".{{r|asimov1973}} Asimov wrote \"I make no secret of the fact that in my mysteries I use [[Agatha Christie]] as my model. In my opinion, her mysteries are the best ever written, far better than the Sherlock Holmes stories, and [[Hercule Poirot]] is the best detective fiction has seen. Why should I not use as my model what I consider the best?\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 379</ref> He enjoyed Sherlock Holmes, but considered [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] to be \"a slapdash and sloppy writer.\"<ref>''I. Asimov: A Memoir'' (1995, Bantam Books), p. 391</ref>\n\nAsimov also enjoyed humorous stories, particularly those of [[P. G. Wodehouse]].<ref>Asimov (1979) ''In Memory Yet Green'' p. 90</ref>\n\nIn non-fiction writing, Asimov particularly admired the writing style of [[Martin Gardner]], and tried to emulate it in his own science books. On meeting Gardner for the first time in 1965, Asimov told him this, to which Gardner answered that he had based his own style on Asimov's.<ref>Asimov, ''In Joy Still Felt'' (Avon, 1980) p. 369</ref>\n\n== Influence ==\n[[Paul Krugman]], holder of a [[Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences|Nobel Prize in Economics]], has stated Asimov's concept of [[Psychohistory (fictional)|psychohistory]] inspired him to become an economist.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://krugman.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/30/who-are-you-calling-dense/ |title=The Conscience of a Liberal, 'Who Are You Calling Dense?' |accessdate=November 18, 2010 |last=Krugman |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Krugman |work=The New York Times |date=August 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\nJohn Jenkins, who has reviewed the vast majority of Asimov's written output, once observed, \"It has been pointed out that most science fiction writers since the 1950s have been affected by Asimov, either modeling their style on his or deliberately avoiding anything like his style.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.asimovreviews.net/NonAsimov/White.html |title=Review of an Asimov biography, 'The Unauthorized Life' |accessdate=September 4, 2012 |last=Jenkins |first=John}}</ref> Along with such figures as [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Karl Popper]], Asimov left his mark as one of the most distinguished [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinarians]] of the 20th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nissani|first=M.|title=Ten Cheers for Interdisciplinarity: The Case for Interdisciplinary Knowledge and Research|url=http://drnissani.net/mnissani/pagepub/10CHEERS.HTM|journal=Social Science Journal |date=1997 |volume=34 |issue=2 |pages=201\u2013216 |doi=10.1016/s0362-3319(97)90051-3}}</ref> \"Few individuals\", writes [[Philosophy: An Introduction to the Art of Wondering|James L.

She was the second of a quartet of ships over 20,000 tons, dubbed [[Big Four (White Star Line)|The Big Four]], and was the largest vessel in the world at the time of her launch.<ref name=\"Roberts1901\">* {{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Chalmers |authorlink=  |date=August 1901 |title=The Biggest Ship |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=II |issue= |pages=1176\u20131179 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IF6tNZnhO7wC&pg=PA1176|accessdate=2009-07-09 |quote= }}</ref>{{not in source|date=September 2019}} After her maiden voyage in 1903, she was in service until 1932.\n\n==History==\n===Construction===\n''Cedric'' was laid down in 1902 at the shipyard of [[Harland and Wolff]], [[Belfast]]. She was the second of [[White Star Line|White Star]]'s series known as the \"[[Big Four (White Star Line)|Big Four]]\", the other three being {{RMS|Celtic|1901|6}}, {{RMS|Baltic|1903|2}} and {{RMS|Adriatic|1906|2}}. ''Celtic'' was the first ship to exceed [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] {{SS|Great Eastern||6}} in overall tonnage, which was quite an accomplishment, considering Brunel's giant ship held the size record for almost 40 years. Except for the ''Adriatic'' all of these in turn, when built, would be the largest ship in the world for a short time. RMS ''Cedric'' was a 21,035-gross register ton ship, {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|75|ft|3.6|in|m|abbr=on}} abeam, with two funnels, four masts, two propellers and a service speed of {{convert|16|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|abbr=on}}. There was accommodation for 365 first-, 160 second- and 2352 third-class passengers, and a crew of about 350. She was launched in Belfast on 21 August 1902, in a private ceremony which included several guests, amongst others [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie|William Pirrie]], the chairman of Harland and Wolff and [[Bruce Ismay]], chairman of White Star Line.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Launch of the Cedric|day_of_week=Friday |date=22 August 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36853| }}</ref> RMS ''Cedric'' commenced her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York on 11 February 1903. This was the only route on which she was ever used, although ''Cedric'' was also sometimes used for winter cruises to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].\n\n===Trans-Atlantic service===\n[[File:RMS Cedric ship log 21 October 1903.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A transcribed copy of the ship's log dated 21 October 1903]]\nFor the next 11 years the ship plied the [[Atlantic]] crossing without any major incident. When the {{RMS|Titanic||6}} sank in April 1912, ''Cedric'' was in [[New York City]] and the ship's departure was delayed until the {{RMS|Carpathia||6}} arrived with survivors, including crew members not required for the court of inquiry, who wished to travel back to [[Liverpool]]. However, ''Cedric'' had to sail without any of ''Titanic''{{'}}s survivors or crew due to their mandated appearances for testimony at the U.S. inquiry. Her last voyage on the Liverpool-New York service started on 21 October 1914, after which she was requisitioned for war service, and she was then converted to an armed merchant cruiser. ''Cedric'' was decommissioned in 1916, and then she was converted into a troopship for operation initially to [[Egypt]] and then to the U.S. In April 1917, her operation came under the auspices of the Liner Requisition Scheme. On 1 July 1917 Cedric collided with and sank the French schooner Yvonne-Odette with 24 crew drowned from the schooner. On 29 January 1918, ''Cedric'' collided with and sank the [[Canadian Pacific]] ship ''Montreal'' off Morecambe Bay. ''Montreal'' was taken in tow, but she sank the next day {{convert|14|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the Mersey Bar [[Lightvessel|lightship]]. ''Cedric'' was returned to her owner in September 1919 and refitted by [[Harland & Wolff]]. She was refitted to accommodate 347 first-, 250 second- and 1000 third-class passengers. She resumed Liverpool\u2013New York voyages. On 30 September 1923, ''Cedric'' collided with the {{RMS|Scythia||6}} of the [[Cunard Line]] in [[Queenstown, Ireland|Queenstown]] ([[Cobh]]) [[harbour]] during dense [[fog]].

She was the second of a quartet of ships over 20,000 tons, dubbed [[Big Four (White Star Line)|The Big Four]], and was the largest vessel in the world at the time of her launch.<ref name=\"Roberts1901\">* {{cite journal |last=Roberts |first=Chalmers |authorlink=  |date=August 1901 |title=The Biggest Ship |journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]] |volume=II |issue= |pages=1176\u20131179 |id= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=IF6tNZnhO7wC&pg=PA1176|accessdate=2009-07-09 |quote= }}</ref>{{not in source|date=September 2019}} After her maiden voyage in 1903, she was in service until 1932.\n\n==History==\n===Construction===\n''Cedric'' was laid down in 1902 at the shipyard of [[Harland and Wolff]], [[Belfast]]. She was the second of [[White Star Line|White Star]]'s series known as the \"[[Big Four (White Star Line)|Big Four]]\", the other three being {{RMS|Celtic|1901|6}}, {{RMS|Baltic|1903|2}} and {{RMS|Adriatic|1906|2}}. ''Celtic'' was the first ship to exceed [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Brunel's]] {{SS|Great Eastern||6}} in overall tonnage, which was quite an accomplishment, considering Brunel's giant ship held the size record for almost 40 years. Except for the ''Adriatic'' all of these in turn, when built, would be the largest ship in the world for a short time. RMS ''Cedric'' was a 21,035-gross register ton ship, {{convert|700|ft|m|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|75|ft|3.6|in|m|abbr=on}} abeam, with two funnels, four masts, two propellers and a service speed of {{convert|16|kn|mph km/h|lk=in|abbr=on}}. There was accommodation for 365 first-, 160 second- and 2352 third-class passengers, and a crew of about 350. She was launched in Belfast on 21 August 1902, in a private ceremony which included several guests, amongst others [[William Pirrie, 1st Viscount Pirrie|William Pirrie]], the chairman of Harland and Wolff and [[Bruce Ismay]], chairman of White Star Line.<ref>{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=Launch of the Cedric|day_of_week=Friday |date=22 August 1902 |page_number=5 |issue=36853| }}</ref> RMS ''Cedric'' commenced her maiden voyage from Liverpool to New York on 11 February 1903. This was the only route on which she was ever used, although ''Cedric'' was also sometimes used for winter cruises to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]].\n\n===Trans-Atlantic service===\n[[File:RMS Cedric ship log 21 October 1903.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A transcribed copy of the ship's log dated 21 October 1903]]\nFor the next 11 years the ship plied the [[Atlantic]] crossing without any major incident. When the {{RMS|Titanic||6}} sank in April 1912, ''Cedric'' was in [[New York City]] and the ship's departure was delayed until the {{RMS|Carpathia||6}} arrived with survivors, including crew members not required for the court of inquiry, who wished to travel back to [[Liverpool]]. However, ''Cedric'' had to sail without any of ''Titanic''{{'}}s survivors or crew due to their mandated appearances for testimony at the U.S. inquiry. Her last voyage on the Liverpool-New York service started on 21 October 1914, after which she was requisitioned for war service, and she was then converted to an armed merchant cruiser. ''Cedric'' was decommissioned in 1916, and then she was converted into a troopship for operation initially to [[Egypt]] and then to the U.S. In April 1917, her operation came under the auspices of the Liner Requisition Scheme. On 1 July 1917 Cedric collided with and sank the French schooner Yvonne-Odette with 24 crew drowned from the schooner. On 29 January 1918, ''Cedric'' collided with and sank the [[Canadian Pacific]] ship ''Montreal'' off Morecambe Bay. ''Montreal'' was taken in tow, but she sank the next day {{convert|14|mi|nmi km|lk=on|abbr=on}} from the Mersey Bar [[Lightvessel|lightship]]. ''Cedric'' was returned to her owner in September 1919 and refitted by [[Harland & Wolff]]. She was refitted to accommodate 347 first-, 250 second- and 1000 third-class passengers. She resumed Liverpool\u2013New York voyages. On 30 September 1923, ''Cedric'' collided with the {{RMS|Scythia||6}} of the [[Cunard Line]] in [[Queenstown, Ireland|Queenstown]] ([[Cobh]]) [[harbour]] during dense [[fog]]. Neither vessel was seriously damaged. On 23 October 1926, she was again altered to cabin, tourist and third class.

His assistant gardener was [[Georg Scholl]] from [[Weilbach, Germany|Weilbach]]. The visit lasted from May 1786 to February 1787 during which he was often accompanied by the Scotsman [[Francis Masson]] in the Cape [[Swartland]] and semi-desert [[Karoo]], collecting live plants, bulbs, seeds, birds, insects and more. From the beginning of 1787 he traveled to the foothills of the [[Cape of Good Hope]] and from April 1787 to several islands, including Ile-de-France ([[Mauritius]]) and Bourbon ([[R\u00e9union]]). George Scholl remained there until 1798 and did not return to Vienna until 1799 while Boos left Cape Town in August 1788 with more than three hundred cases of plants for the [[herbarium]] of the Imperial Court Natural History Cabinet (now the [[Vienna Natural History Museum]]). Among the plants were several replicates of the Cape Lily (''[[Veltheimia capensis]]''), whose bulbs were propagated, their descendants now on display in the \"Desert House (Sundial House)\" in the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Zoo. A ''[[Fockea capensis]]'' (family [[Euphorbiaceae]])  was also collected from this expedition: it is the oldest cultivated in a pot of [[succulents]] in the world. Boos also brought twelve living mammals and around 250 birds. Many of the species were subsequently described by Jacquin with illustrations.After finishing his work with M\u00e4rten and his men in North America Boos was sent to South Africa, the Mascarenes and Madagascar. He travelled from the Cape to Isle de France, and from there to Trieste carrying the natural history collections on the ''Pepita''. In the course of future work for Schonbrunn he left in Trinidad pepper, vegetables and other plants from Malabar and SE Asia.\n\nBoos was evidently the leader as he was well educated, spoke several languages and was a botanist as well as a gardener, whereas Scholl was a working gardener with little scientific knowledge. Joseph II\u2019s intention was for them to make collections of tropical plants from Isle de France, but bad weather forced their ship to shelter at the Cape of Good Hope delaying their departure. Many South African plants were collected, on one occasion together with the Scottish gardener-botanist [[Francis Masson]] from Kew Gardens in London. Boos eventually travelled on to Mauritius leaving Scholl behind to continue collecting, returning to the Cape in 1788 for a few months before leaving for Vienna in July 1788 with a large collection of specimens and living plants. Scholl remained at the Cape for twelve years unable to get passage on a ship that was prepared to transport his plant collections. At the Cape Scholl was assisted by Colonel [[Robert Jacob Gordon]] who gave him protection, assisted him with his field excursions and allowed him to grow his plants in his garden, often referred to in the literature as \u2018the Gordon\u2019s Garden\u2019. Many plants were established in this garden and Scholl collected their seed. Scholl sent several shipments of dried bulbs and seeds to Vienna, four of these being recorded in the Cape Archives in the period 1790 to 1792.<ref name=\"Erica\">[http://www.krca.co.za/extinct_erica_verticillata See - History of [[Erica verticillata]]]</ref>\n\nPlants were shipped to the Austrian Consul in Holland who then forwarded them upriver and overland to Vienna. Scholl eventually returned to Vienna in 1799 with his large collection of living plants and seed from [[Erica]] species. Present-day botanist Dr Kiehn and staff at the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Botanical Gardens believe that the ericas now growing at the Belvedere Palace Garden date back over 200 years to the Boos and Scholl collections as there is no evidence of any other collections being grown. Both the Belvedere Palace and Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace Gardens were damaged by bombing at the end of the Second World War but though most of the glasshouse plants were destroyed at the end of the war many survived because they were purposely propagated for other gardens and glasshouses.<ref name=\"Erica\"/>\n\nAfter Boos left the Isle de France and Pamplemousses, the garden's Director [[Jean-Nicolas C\u00e9r\u00e9]] hosted, from July 1788 to March 1789, Joseph Martin an '\u00e9l\u00e8ve-gardener' under he charge of  [[Andr\u00e9 Thouin]] Head Gardener of the [[Jardin du Roi]]. He was to send spice and other plants to acclimatize in [[Paris]], [[Cayenne]] and [[Antilles]] gardens. But he also managed to botanize on Madagascar and the Cape. With the successful conclusion of his journey Martin was appointed Director of the acclimatisation garden at Cayenne.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ly-Tio-Fane|1996|p=}}</ref>\n\n==Association with Nicolas Baudin==\nWhen Boos travelled from the Cape to Isle de France, and from there to Trieste carrying the natural history collections it was on the ship ''Pepita'' commanded by [[Nicolas Baudin]], at that time a merchant mariner. Baudin was interested in the collections which included many specimens from the [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden|Pamplemousses Botanical Garden]] on the Isle de France (Mauritius). From Boos Baudin learned much about the transport of live plants and animals and the storage of natural history specimens, knowledge that he would later use in the scientific exploration of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] (Australia), and elsewhere, for Napoleon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Horner|1987|p=25}}</ref> The arrival of the ''Pepita'', under its formal name, ''Josepha'',was reported in the press: <blockquote>Vienna, 21 July.

Boudin, coming from the East Indies has anchored in the harbour there with various animals and plants for the Emperor's menagerie at Schoenbrunn, for his gardens and for his Natural History Cabinet.

In 1810 he was admitted to the Imperial Council to eventually retire in 1827. Boos\u2019s successor as Director of the Courtyard Gardens and Menagerie at Sch\u00f6nbrunn was Bredemeyer who, in 1793 was appointed Head Gardener, a post he held from 1827 until his death in 1839. Apart from his many plant and animal introductions Boos also prepared a plan of the courtyard gardens of Sch\u00f6nbrunn in 1780 shortly after they had been completed. Together with his son [[Joseph Boos]], also a keen gardener and botanist at Sch\u00f6nbrunn he published, in 1816, a catalogue of the cultivated and wild plants grown during his time at Sch\u00f6nbrunn (''Sch\u00f6nbrunn's flora'', the cultivated plants of the Royal Dutch botanical courtyard garden at Sch\u00f6nbrunn (published by Geistinger, Vienna and Trieste).<ref name=bm/>  The later D\u00fcsseldorf garden artist [[Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe]]  while training as a gardener studied with Franz Boos in Vienna. Boos was a childhood friend of Peter Joseph Elder a senior gardener since 1788 in Br\u00fchl (Rhineland) and Head of the Botanical Garden of the University of Bonn and gave his son Peter Joseph (who later became famous landscape gardener) a job at Sch\u00f6nbrunn.

George Scholl remained there until 1798 and did not return to Vienna until 1799 while Boos left Cape Town in August 1788 with more than three hundred cases of plants for the [[herbarium]] of the Imperial Court Natural History Cabinet (now the [[Vienna Natural History Museum]]). Among the plants were several replicates of the Cape Lily (''[[Veltheimia capensis]]''), whose bulbs were propagated, their descendants now on display in the \"Desert House (Sundial House)\" in the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Zoo. A ''[[Fockea capensis]]'' (family [[Euphorbiaceae]])  was also collected from this expedition: it is the oldest cultivated in a pot of [[succulents]] in the world. Boos also brought twelve living mammals and around 250 birds. Many of the species were subsequently described by Jacquin with illustrations.After finishing his work with M\u00e4rten and his men in North America Boos was sent to South Africa, the Mascarenes and Madagascar. He travelled from the Cape to Isle de France, and from there to Trieste carrying the natural history collections on the ''Pepita''. In the course of future work for Schonbrunn he left in Trinidad pepper, vegetables and other plants from Malabar and SE Asia.\n\nBoos was evidently the leader as he was well educated, spoke several languages and was a botanist as well as a gardener, whereas Scholl was a working gardener with little scientific knowledge. Joseph II\u2019s intention was for them to make collections of tropical plants from Isle de France, but bad weather forced their ship to shelter at the Cape of Good Hope delaying their departure. Many South African plants were collected, on one occasion together with the Scottish gardener-botanist [[Francis Masson]] from Kew Gardens in London. Boos eventually travelled on to Mauritius leaving Scholl behind to continue collecting, returning to the Cape in 1788 for a few months before leaving for Vienna in July 1788 with a large collection of specimens and living plants. Scholl remained at the Cape for twelve years unable to get passage on a ship that was prepared to transport his plant collections. At the Cape Scholl was assisted by Colonel [[Robert Jacob Gordon]] who gave him protection, assisted him with his field excursions and allowed him to grow his plants in his garden, often referred to in the literature as \u2018the Gordon\u2019s Garden\u2019. Many plants were established in this garden and Scholl collected their seed. Scholl sent several shipments of dried bulbs and seeds to Vienna, four of these being recorded in the Cape Archives in the period 1790 to 1792.<ref name=\"Erica\">[http://www.krca.co.za/extinct_erica_verticillata See - History of [[Erica verticillata]]]</ref>\n\nPlants were shipped to the Austrian Consul in Holland who then forwarded them upriver and overland to Vienna. Scholl eventually returned to Vienna in 1799 with his large collection of living plants and seed from [[Erica]] species. Present-day botanist Dr Kiehn and staff at the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Botanical Gardens believe that the ericas now growing at the Belvedere Palace Garden date back over 200 years to the Boos and Scholl collections as there is no evidence of any other collections being grown. Both the Belvedere Palace and Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace Gardens were damaged by bombing at the end of the Second World War but though most of the glasshouse plants were destroyed at the end of the war many survived because they were purposely propagated for other gardens and glasshouses.<ref name=\"Erica\"/>\n\nAfter Boos left the Isle de France and Pamplemousses, the garden's Director [[Jean-Nicolas C\u00e9r\u00e9]] hosted, from July 1788 to March 1789, Joseph Martin an '\u00e9l\u00e8ve-gardener' under he charge of  [[Andr\u00e9 Thouin]] Head Gardener of the [[Jardin du Roi]]. He was to send spice and other plants to acclimatize in [[Paris]], [[Cayenne]] and [[Antilles]] gardens. But he also managed to botanize on Madagascar and the Cape. With the successful conclusion of his journey Martin was appointed Director of the acclimatisation garden at Cayenne.<ref>{{Harvnb|Ly-Tio-Fane|1996|p=}}</ref>\n\n==Association with Nicolas Baudin==\nWhen Boos travelled from the Cape to Isle de France, and from there to Trieste carrying the natural history collections it was on the ship ''Pepita'' commanded by [[Nicolas Baudin]], at that time a merchant mariner. Baudin was interested in the collections which included many specimens from the [[Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam Botanical Garden|Pamplemousses Botanical Garden]] on the Isle de France (Mauritius). From Boos Baudin learned much about the transport of live plants and animals and the storage of natural history specimens, knowledge that he would later use in the scientific exploration of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] (Australia), and elsewhere, for Napoleon.<ref>{{Harvnb|Horner|1987|p=25}}</ref> The arrival of the ''Pepita'', under its formal name, ''Josepha'',was reported in the press: <blockquote>Vienna, 21 July. According to letters from Trieste, the French freighter Josepha, Cap. Boudin, coming from the East Indies has anchored in the harbour there with various animals and plants for the Emperor's menagerie at Schoenbrunn, for his gardens and for his Natural History Cabinet. These animals and plants have been collected by order of His Majesty with the greatest care by Mr. Boos, Imperial Court Gardener, which he has sought out in the Isles of France and Bourbon, in Madagascar and at the Cape of Good Hope.<ref>''Gazette van Gend,'' 3 Julii, ''Gazeta de Madrid,'' 22 Julio, ''Wekelijks Nieuws uit Loven,'' 24 Augusti, ''Gazeta de Lisboa,'' 2 Setembro 1788.</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Plant collections==\nBoos collected in Europe, Austria, South Africa, Madagascar, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and the West Indies his collections probably in the British Museum of Natural Historia and Vienna.<ref name=bm/>\n\n''[[Haemanthus amarylloides]]'' [[Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin|Jacq.]] is an endemic South African [[bulb|bulbous plant]] first described in 1804 by [[Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin]] from specimens sent to the [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] gardens by Boos and Scholl.In 1799 a cycad was collected by Georg Scholl on the Cape, this being returned to Vienna where, in 1801, it was described and illustrated as ''[[Zamia cycadifolia]]'' by botanist Jaquin.<ref>{{Harvnb|Whitelock|2003|p=188}}</ref>\n\n==Other achievements and honours==\nOn his return from Africa Boos replaced Jacquin as Director of the Sch\u00f6nbrunn parks and gardens.<ref name=bm/> After the death of [[Richard van der Schot]], and because of his achievements, in 1790 Emperor Leopold II appointed Boos Director of the Sch\u00f6nbrunn Menagerie and the so-called \"Dutch Palace Garden\", then in 1807 Director of all the Courtyards. In 1810 he was admitted to the Imperial Council to eventually retire in 1827. Boos\u2019s successor as Director of the Courtyard Gardens and Menagerie at Sch\u00f6nbrunn was Bredemeyer who, in 1793 was appointed Head Gardener, a post he held from 1827 until his death in 1839. Apart from his many plant and animal introductions Boos also prepared a plan of the courtyard gardens of Sch\u00f6nbrunn in 1780 shortly after they had been completed. Together with his son [[Joseph Boos]], also a keen gardener and botanist at Sch\u00f6nbrunn he published, in 1816, a catalogue of the cultivated and wild plants grown during his time at Sch\u00f6nbrunn (''Sch\u00f6nbrunn's flora'', the cultivated plants of the Royal Dutch botanical courtyard garden at Sch\u00f6nbrunn (published by Geistinger, Vienna and Trieste).<ref name=bm/>  The later D\u00fcsseldorf garden artist [[Maximilian Friedrich Weyhe]]  while training as a gardener studied with Franz Boos in Vienna. Boos was a childhood friend of Peter Joseph Elder a senior gardener since 1788 in Br\u00fchl (Rhineland) and Head of the Botanical Garden of the University of Bonn and gave his son Peter Joseph (who later became famous landscape gardener) a job at Sch\u00f6nbrunn. In 1905 Franz Boos Lane in [[Hietzing]], Vienna, was named after him.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of gardener-botanist explorers of the Enlightenment]]\n* [[European and American voyages of scientific exploration]]\n* [http://www.botanicus.org/title/b11927926 ''Plantarum Rariorum Horti Caesarei Schoenbrunnensis'' (4 volumes, 1797\u20131804)] Nicolas Jaquin's catalogue of plants held in the collections at the [[Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace]] of [[Emperor Joseph II]] in Vienna between 1797 and 1804.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* \u201eFranz Boos, Director der k.k.

She made a memorable impression in a brief uncredited part, as a frustrated mother unable to find the toy that Kris Kringle has promised her son. Her third role, in writer-director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]]'s ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'' (1949), left a mark, although Ritter was again uncredited. Mankiewicz kept Ritter in mind, and cast her as Birdie in ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950), which earned her an Oscar nomination. A second nomination followed for her work in [[Mitchell Leisen]]'s' ensemble [[screwball comedy]] ''[[The Mating Season (film)|The Mating Season]]'' (1951) starring [[Gene Tierney]] and [[John Lund (actor)|John Lund]]. She enjoyed steady film work for the next dozen years.\n\nShe appeared in many of the episodic drama TV series of the 1950s, such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', and ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]''. Other film roles were as [[James Stewart]]'s nurse in ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954) and as [[Doris Day]]'s maid in ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959). Although best known for comedy roles, she played the occasional dramatic role, most notably in ''[[With a Song in My Heart (film)|With a Song in My Heart]]'' (1952), ''[[Pickup on South Street]]'' (1953), ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953), ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), and ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz]]''  (1962), for which she received her final Oscar nomination.\n\nHer last work was an appearance on ''[[The Jerry Lewis Show]]'' on January 23, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewindmillsofyourmind.com/jerry-lewis-show |title=Appearance on ''Jerry Lewis Show'' |publisher=Thewindmillsofyourmind.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nRitter died of a heart attack in New York City in 1969.\n\n==Work==\n=== Film ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

She made a memorable impression in a brief uncredited part, as a frustrated mother unable to find the toy that Kris Kringle has promised her son. Her third role, in writer-director [[Joseph L. Mankiewicz]]'s ''[[A Letter to Three Wives]]'' (1949), left a mark, although Ritter was again uncredited. Mankiewicz kept Ritter in mind, and cast her as Birdie in ''[[All About Eve]]'' (1950), which earned her an Oscar nomination. A second nomination followed for her work in [[Mitchell Leisen]]'s' ensemble [[screwball comedy]] ''[[The Mating Season (film)|The Mating Season]]'' (1951) starring [[Gene Tierney]] and [[John Lund (actor)|John Lund]]. She enjoyed steady film work for the next dozen years.\n\nShe appeared in many of the episodic drama TV series of the 1950s, such as ''[[Alfred Hitchcock Presents]]'', ''[[General Electric Theater]]'', and ''[[The United States Steel Hour]]''. Other film roles were as [[James Stewart]]'s nurse in ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954) and as [[Doris Day]]'s maid in ''[[Pillow Talk (film)|Pillow Talk]]'' (1959). Although best known for comedy roles, she played the occasional dramatic role, most notably in ''[[With a Song in My Heart (film)|With a Song in My Heart]]'' (1952), ''[[Pickup on South Street]]'' (1953), ''[[Titanic (1953 film)|Titanic]]'' (1953), ''[[The Misfits (1961 film)|The Misfits]]'' (1961), and ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz]]''  (1962), for which she received her final Oscar nomination.\n\nHer last work was an appearance on ''[[The Jerry Lewis Show]]'' on January 23, 1968.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thewindmillsofyourmind.com/jerry-lewis-show |title=Appearance on ''Jerry Lewis Show'' |publisher=Thewindmillsofyourmind.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-04}}</ref>\n\n==Death==\nRitter died of a heart attack in New York City in 1969.\n\n==Work==\n=== Film ===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!

As a child, she suffered from chronic [[rheumatic fever]] and, between the ages of five and twelve, was forced to spend six months of each year in bed or in hospitals, which she said fostered her introspective side. She attended the Banff School of Fine Arts as a teenager and studied acting at the [[University of Victoria]] in [[British Columbia]].\n\n==Career==\nAfter roles in such Canadian features as ''Outrageous!'' (1977), ''[[Starship Invasions]]'' (1977), ''Who Has Seen the Wind'' (1977) and ''High Ballin{{'}}'' (1978), Shaver won a Canadian Film Award as Best Lead Actress opposite [[Tom Berenger]] (for her performance as \"Ann MacDonald\") in ''[[In Praise of Older Women (1978 film)|In Praise of Older Women]]'' (1978).\n\nShaver was one of the stars of director [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s final film, 1983's ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]''.

Another prominent film performance during that time came in 1986 as the love interest of [[Paul Newman]] in his Oscar-winning portrayal of \"Fast\" Eddie Felson in Scorsese's ''[[The Color of Money]]'', a sequel to 1961's ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]''.\n[[File:Helen Shaver star on Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Shaver's star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]]]]\nIn 1980, Shaver starred with [[Beau Bridges]] in the short-lived NBC TV series ''[[United States (TV series)|United States]]'' developed by [[Larry Gelbart]].

In 1990, she guest-starred as the murderer in ''[[Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo]]'', and later that year co-starred on the short-lived series ''[[WIOU (TV series)|WIOU]]'', playing a television journalist (as she also did on ''Jessica Novak''). From 1996-1999, Shaver co-starred on the TV series ''[[Poltergeist: The Legacy]]'',  playing Dr. Rachel Corrigan, a widowed psychiatrist with an eight-year-old daughter who is helped by the Legacy in the pilot episode; her performance earned a [[Saturn Award]] nomination. In 2000, she won a [[Genie Award]] for her portrayal of a drug-addicted [[prostitute]] in the independent feature ''[[We All Fall Down (2000 film)|We All Fall Down]]''.\n\nShaver made her feature-length directorial debut in 1999 with ''[[Summer's End (film)|Summer's End]]'', which won an [[Emmy]] and earned her a directorial nomination.

She has received [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Saturn Award]] nominations, among other honours.\n\n==Early life==\nShaver was born and raised, with five sisters, in [[St. Thomas, Ontario]], Canada, a small city located near [[London, Ontario]]. As a child, she suffered from chronic [[rheumatic fever]] and, between the ages of five and twelve, was forced to spend six months of each year in bed or in hospitals, which she said fostered her introspective side. She attended the Banff School of Fine Arts as a teenager and studied acting at the [[University of Victoria]] in [[British Columbia]].\n\n==Career==\nAfter roles in such Canadian features as ''Outrageous!'' (1977), ''[[Starship Invasions]]'' (1977), ''Who Has Seen the Wind'' (1977) and ''High Ballin{{'}}'' (1978), Shaver won a Canadian Film Award as Best Lead Actress opposite [[Tom Berenger]] (for her performance as \"Ann MacDonald\") in ''[[In Praise of Older Women (1978 film)|In Praise of Older Women]]'' (1978).\n\nShaver was one of the stars of director [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s final film, 1983's ''[[The Osterman Weekend (film)|The Osterman Weekend]]''. In 1985, Shaver starred in ''[[Desert Hearts]]'' as a 1950s university professor who falls in love with another woman.<ref name=NYT>{{cite web|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Desert Hearts (1985) FILM: 'DESERT HEARTS,' ABOUT WOMEN IN LOVE|authorlink=Vincent Canby|first=Vincent|last=Canby|date=April 4, 1986|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9A0DE5D9133FF937A35757C0A960948260}}</ref> Her performance, with co-star [[Patricia Charbonneau]], drew critical praise and Shaver won the Bronze Leopard Award at the [[Locarno International Film Festival]]. Another prominent film performance during that time came in 1986 as the love interest of [[Paul Newman]] in his Oscar-winning portrayal of \"Fast\" Eddie Felson in Scorsese's ''[[The Color of Money]]'', a sequel to 1961's ''[[The Hustler (film)|The Hustler]]''.\n[[File:Helen Shaver star on Walk of Fame.jpg|thumb|right|Helen Shaver's star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]]]]\nIn 1980, Shaver starred with [[Beau Bridges]] in the short-lived NBC TV series ''[[United States (TV series)|United States]]'' developed by [[Larry Gelbart]]. A year later she starred in the short-lived drama series ''[[Jessica Novak]]''. She subsequently appeared on such television shows as ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'' and ''[[T. J. Hooker]]''. In 1990, she guest-starred as the murderer in ''[[Rest in Peace, Mrs. Columbo]]'', and later that year co-starred on the short-lived series ''[[WIOU (TV series)|WIOU]]'', playing a television journalist (as she also did on ''Jessica Novak''). From 1996-1999, Shaver co-starred on the TV series ''[[Poltergeist: The Legacy]]'',  playing Dr. Rachel Corrigan, a widowed psychiatrist with an eight-year-old daughter who is helped by the Legacy in the pilot episode; her performance earned a [[Saturn Award]] nomination. In 2000, she won a [[Genie Award]] for her portrayal of a drug-addicted [[prostitute]] in the independent feature ''[[We All Fall Down (2000 film)|We All Fall Down]]''.\n\nShaver made her feature-length directorial debut in 1999 with ''[[Summer's End (film)|Summer's End]]'', which won an [[Emmy]] and earned her a directorial nomination.  Shaver has also directed a number of television shows and cable movies, including ''[[The Outer Limits (1995 TV series)|The Outer Limits]]'', ''[[Judging Amy]]'', ''[[Joan of Arcadia]]'', ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]'', ''[[The OC]]'', ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', ''[[The L Word]]'', ''[[Jericho (2006 TV series)|Jericho]]'', ''[[Journeyman (TV series)|Journeyman]]'', ''[[Private Practice (TV series)|Private Practice]]'', ''[[The Unit]]'', ''[[Crusoe (TV series)|Crusoe]]'', ''[[Orphan Black]]'' [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vikings_(2013_TV_series)]], ''[[13 Reasons Why]]'', and ''[[Westworld (TV series)|Westworld]]''. In 2003 she won a [[18th Gemini Awards#Best Direction in a Dramatic Series|Gemini award]] for Best Direction in a Dramatic Series for the ''[[Just Cause (TV series)|Just Cause]]'' television series episode \"Death's Details\".\n\nIn  2004, Shaver was inducted into [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].<ref>[http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductee/helen-shaver Canada Walk of Fame induction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081214185946/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/inductee/helen-shaver |date=2008-12-14 }}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nShaver dated screenwriter Stephen C.
