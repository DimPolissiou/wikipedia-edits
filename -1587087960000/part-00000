He has also won the prestigious [[Bathurst 1000]] touring car endurance race twice, in [[1989 Bathurst 1000|1989]] and [[1994 Bathurst 1000|1994]]. Both wins were as co-driver with longtime friend and teammate [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] driving for iconic Ford team [[Dick Johnson Racing]].\n\n==Racing Cars==\nBowe began racing at the age of sixteen in Formula Vee [[Elfin Sports Cars|Elfin]] 500 in 1971, winning the Tasmanian state title on debut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnbowe.com.au/jbs-story |title=John Bowe \u2013 Australian Motorsport Champion |publisher=John Bowe Racing |accessdate=16 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026143432/http://www.johnbowe.com.au/jbs-story |archive-date=26 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The following year, he also won the Tasmanian Formula Ford title.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wilsonsecurityracing.com.au/driver_john_bowe.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119064854/http://www.wilsonsecurityracing.com.au/driver_john_bowe.php |archive-date=19 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from domestic Formula Ford racing Bowe moved into the Australian Drivers Championship in the late 1970s, racing [[Elfin Sports Cars|Elfin]] [[Formula 5000]]s for the most prestigious team of the era, the factory Ansett Team Elfin run by Elfin Sports Cars founder and chief designer [[Garrie Cooper]]. The pinnacle of his Formula 5000 career was finishing runner up in the [[1979 Australian Grand Prix]] driving one of Cooper's [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet]] V8 powered Elfin MR8s. In the same year he also came second in the [[Australian Formula 2]] Championship.\n\nBowe would finish third in the [[1980 Australian Drivers' Championship]] driving the MR8, and would finish fourth in the [[1980 Australian Formula 2 Championship|Formula 2]] title. He would finish fourth in [[1981 Australian Drivers' Championship|1981]] driving the [[Elfin Sports Cars|Elfin MR9]], the only [[Ground effect (cars)|Ground effects]] F5000 ever built. He also dropped to ninth place in the [[1981 Australian Formula 2 Championship|Formula 2 championship]] driving an Elfin Two-25 [[Volkswagen]].\n\nAfter playing second fiddle to [[Alfredo Costanzo]] for several seasons, Bowe broke through for his first Australian Drivers' Championship in [[1984 Australian Drivers' Championship|1984]], backing it up the [[1985 Australian Drivers' Championship|following year]] with his second title in his [[Cosworth#The BDA series|Ford]] powered [[Ralt RT4]] for Chris Leach. The 1984 and 1985 championships were run under [[Formula Mondial]] regulations.\n\nBowe qualified on the front row for the [[1984 Australian Grand Prix]] at [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder Park]] in [[Melbourne]] and led the race for the first 18 laps before a loose spark plug lead caused the [[Inline 4|4 cyl]] Ford engine to misfire and he was passed by defending race winner [[Roberto Moreno]] of [[Brazil]] who went on to win the race. Bowe finally stopped on lap 33 and rejoined in 13th place. He would fight his way back to 6th place by the end of the race (2 laps down), setting the 3rd fastest race lap behind Moreno's Ralt and the similar car of [[Formula One]] driver [[Andrea de Cesaris]].\n\nBowe's last open wheeler race was in the Formula Mondial support race at the [[1986 Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Adelaide]]. Driving a Ralt RT4 in the race (for the first time in 12 months), Bowe equalled the category lap record for the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] set one year earlier by American driver [[Ross Cheever]], the younger brother of [[Formula One]] driver [[Eddie Cheever]]. Bowe's time of 1:33.20 for the 3.780&nbsp;km (2.362&nbsp;mi) track compared to the fastest Formula One race lap of the circuit that year of 1:20.78 set by [[Nelson Piquet]] driving a {{Convert|1000|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} turbocharged [[Williams FW11|Williams]]-[[Honda F1|Honda]].\n\n==Sports Cars==\nJohn Bowe drove the Bryan Thompson\u2013owned [[Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class|Mercedes-Benz 450 SLC]]-[[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet]] twin-turbo in Sports Sedan and GT events during the early 1980s when Thompson was in retirement, which stopped when Thompson came out of retirement in 1983. The Mercedes with its 4.2-litre Chevrolet engine put out a reported {{Convert|1100|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, but was somewhat unreliable due to the use of smaller turbo's.\n\nIn 1985 while still contesting the Australian drivers' Championship, Bowe was approached by [[Adelaide]]-based photographer and Sports Car racer Bernie Van Elsen to race his new car for the [[Australian Sports Car Championship]] (ASCC). The car, built by K&A Engineering in Adelaide and called a [[Veskanda C1]], was initially powered by an F5000 sourced 5.0-litre Chevrolet [[V8 engine|V8]], though this was changed to a 5.8-litre (350 cui) Chevrolet V8 in 1986 when [[Confederation of Australian Motorsport|CAMS]] increased the engine capacity limit for [[Group A Sports Cars]] from 5000 cc to 6000 cc. The Veskanda is generally regarded as the fastest Sports Car ever designed and built in Australia. In Bowe's talented hands the Veskanda Chev easily won the [[1986 Australian Sports Car Championship]], with the Bowe setting outright lap records (often faster than the [[Open wheel car|open wheelers]]) at circuits around the country. Two of these records will stand forever as the tracks are now closed: [[Amaroo Park]] in [[Sydney]] (set in 1987, track closed in 1998), and the [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway]] (set in 1986, track closed in late 1987).\n\nBowe and the Veskanda finished second in the three round [[1987 Australian Sports Car Championship|1987 ASCC]] after engine reliability troubles saw him retire from the first race at a very wet [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder Park]] in [[Melbourne]]. He then easily won the final two rounds at Amaroo and [[Sandown Raceway|Sandown Park]] to finish nineteen points behind Andy Roberts in his self-designed Roberts SR3. Following the season the car was parked as Bowe was moving full-time into Touring Car Racing in 1988.\n\nVan Elsen entered the Veskanda in the [[1988 360km of Sandown Park|Sandown 360]] which was a round of that year's [[1988 World Sportscar Championship season|1988 World Sports-Prototype Championship]]. Bowe teamed with his Touring Car team owner and teammate [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] in the Veskanda (the 5.8 litre V8 was replaced for the meeting by a 6.0 litre Chevrolet V8). After qualifying a credible 8th with a time of 1:35.510 (compared to [[Jean Louis Schlesser]]'s pole time of 1:28.620 in his [[Sauber C9]]), the pair completed 87 laps, six less than the winning Sauber C9 of Schlesser and [[Jochen Mass]]. Unlike the [[1984 1000 km of Sandown Park|1984]] [[World Sportscar Championship]] race when Australian sports cars, GT and sports sedans had been permitted to compete in a special class by the [[FIA]], Australian cars were not eligible for the 1988 event. However, although the Veskanda had been built to comply with CAMS Group A rules, it had also been built to the FIA's [[Group C]] sports car rules and was thus free to enter and race.\n\nUltimately the Bowe / Johnson Veskanda, the only Australian car in the 18 car field, was disqualified for using more fuel than the rules allowed.\n\n==Touring Cars==\nBowe's two [[Australian Drivers' Championship|CAMS Gold Stars]] in 1984 and 1985 saw him finally get the attention of the Australian [[Touring Car Racing|touring car]] establishment. In mid-1985 he was contacted by New Zealander Mark Petch to join the [[Mark Petch Motorsport]] [[Volvo 200 Series#240 in motorsport|Volvo 240 Turbo]] team during the [[1985 Australian Endurance Championship]]. Bowe co-drove with the teams lead driver [[Robbie Francevic]] at the [[1985 Castrol 500|Sandown 500]] and the [[1985 James Hardie 1000|Bathurst 1000]]. They were a DNF at Sandown after the differential in the Volvo locked solid underneath Bowe at the entrance to the pits on lap 60 (the car had to be pushed into the pits with the rear end supported by a [[Jack (device)|trolley jack]]). At Bathurst the turbocharged Volvo was considered the only car capable of matching the speed of the three [[Jaguar V12 engine#5.3 Litre|V12]] [[Jaguar XJS]]' run by [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]]. The Volvo qualified fifth fastest after Hardie's Heroes (set by Francevic), and after running second and third in the early laps, was destined to spend time in the pits having the alternator replaced, losing many laps. The car failed to finish after running out of fuel on lap 122. Despite it being only the second time he had driven the Volvo, and not having previously driven at the [[Mount Panorama Circuit]], Bowe proved to be as quick in the car at Bathurst as Francevic until late in the final qualifying session when the team put on a set of qualifying tyres and Francevic set the third fastest time.\n\nPrior to 1985, Bowe had never driven the Bathurst circuit and before practice started enlisted the services star driver [[Allan Grice]] to show him how to drive the track. Grice was only too happy to show the Bathurst rookie the fast way around the daunting circuit, something Bowe continues to be grateful for.\n\nDuring the [[1986 Australian Touring Car Championship]] the new factory-supported [[Volvo Dealer Team]] replaced the Mark Petch Motorsport outfit and expanded to a second car and Bowe joined Francevic in the team full-time at round four. Bowe proved he could match it with the likes of Francevic, [[Peter Brock]], [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]], [[George Fury]] and [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] by qualifying on pole and easily leading the 5th round of the championship at [[Wanneroo Raceway|Wanneroo]] in [[Perth]] until the new Volvo's engine went off song and forced him to retire.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22ckiXuyMjk 1986 ATCC Barbagello Round 5]</ref> Francevic went on to win the championship, with Bowe taking eighth place in the series including a pair of third places at Calder Park and also at [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] in Sydney. Also in 1986, Bowe raced the Veskanda-Chevrolet Sports car owned by Bernie van Elsen and used it to dominate the [[Australian Sports Car Championship]], along the way setting outright lap records at various tracks around the country.\n\nBowe became the lead driver of the Volvo team after Francevic was fired from the team shortly by team boss John Sheppard after his refusal to drive a newly built car at the [[1986 Castrol 500]] (he was also fired for comments made to the media on race morning which Francevic claimed was aimed at the race officials, but Sheppard took as criticising the team). Once again though, the Volvo proved fragile and unable to effectively threaten for the [[1986 Australian Endurance Championship|1986 endurance races]], though Bowe was able to qualify the Volvo in fifth place for the [[1986 James Hardie 1000]]. The team closed at the end of the season leaving Bowe without a drive for the 1987 season.\n\nHe was picked up by the [[Gibson Motor Sport|Peter Jackson Nissan Racing]] team for the 1987 endurance season, mainly as a co-driver with young sensation [[Glenn Seton]]. The pair finished fourth at Bathurst in the [[Nissan Skyline#RS|Nissan Skyline RS DR30]], and were later promoted to second after the disqualification of the [[Eggenberger Motorsport|Texaco Eggenberger Ford team]]. Although the Nissan's won a number of touring car races in Australia during 1986 and 1987, Bowe would later claim both privately and publicly that the turbocharged [[Inline-four engine|4 cyl]] DR30 Skyline (which had no aerodynamic aids making it very unstable at high speed) was the worst touring car he ever raced, thoughts that were echoed by regular Nissan drivers Seton and [[George Fury]].\n\nBowe's first major touring car win came in the [[1987 Yokohama/Bob Jane T-Marts 300]] at the [[Calder Park Raceway]]. The race was run on the rarely used combined circuit which incorporated both the 1986 redeveloped road course and the newly completed [[NASCAR]]-style \"Thunderdome\" oval. Bowe and [[Sydney]] driver Terry Shiel won the race, the first on the combined course, driving the Peter Jackson team's spare Nissan Skyline RS DR30 from the [[Holden VL Commodore|Holden VL Commodore SS Group A]] of Bowe's former open wheel rival [[Larry Perkins]], and the Commodore's owner [[Bill O'Brien (racing driver)|Bill O'Brien]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL1auARPaDA 1987 Calder Park 300 Highlights]</ref> As of 2016 this is believed to be the only touring car victory for a [[Japan]]ese car on the high-banked Thunderdome.\n\nFor [[1988 Australian Touring Car season|1988]], [[Dick Johnson Racing]] hired Bowe, replacing [[Gregg Hansford]] as the teams number two driver in their [[Ford Sierra RS500]]'s. Team manager [[Neal Lowe]] had completely re-engineered the cars after an embarrassing 1987 endurance season and the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] backed cars proved to be the class of the field. Bowe won his third race for the team, his first ever ATCC race win, at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]] and would go on to win again at [[Amaroo Park]], finishing second in the [[1988 Australian Touring Car Championship|1988 ATCC]] behind team boss [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]]. The pair salvaged a runner up position at Bathurst in the team's third entry (Bowe's ATCC Sierra) after their two primary cars failed early in the race. After Johnson and Bowe's Sierra's failed, they moved into the No. 18 car which had at that stage been driven by one of Bowe's former open wheel rivals John Smith (another open wheel rival, Alfredo Costanzo, was to be Smith's co-driver but didn't get to drive at Bathurst after Dick and John swapped cars).\n\nAfter the 1988 ATCC, DJR took one Dick's championship winning Sierra to the [[Silverstone Circuit]] to contest the [[RAC Tourist Trophy]]. DJR proved they had the fastest Group A Sierra's in the world when Dick Johnson easily won the pole by just under half a second against the best [[European Touring Car Championship|European]] and [[British Touring Car Championship|British]] opposition. Johnson and Bowe led the race early on and were pulling away from the Eggenberger and [[Andy Rouse]] Sierra's, with Johnson setting the circuits Group A lap record, until the water pump in the car failed and had to be replaced. Rouse would go on to win the race, with the DJR Sierra eventually finishing 21st\n\nThe [[1989 Australian Touring Car season|1989 ATCC]] would prove to be more of the same for Bowe, again finishing runner up to Johnson after taking victories at Amaroo Park and [[Barbagallo Raceway|Wanneroo]]. The [[1989 Tooheys 1000]] at Bathurst was a triumph for Bowe and Johnson, seeing off all challengers on their way to victory, including the Eggenberger built and engineered [[Allan Moffat Racing|Allan Moffat]] Sierra's driven by European aces [[Klaus Niedzwiedz]] and [[Frank Biela]], as well as [[Peter Brock]]'s Rouse built Sierra (with Rouse himself co-driving) which Brock had put on pole position. With the Shell Sierra limping due to failing turbo boost, Bowe drove the car over the finish line at Bathurst, saying to [[ATN|Channel 7]] commentator Mike Raymond \"Fancy doing that\" over [[racecam]] as he did so.\n\nOver the next three seasons his 1987 team Nissan, now running the formidable [[4WD]], twin-turbo [[Nissan Skyline R32|Nissan GT-R]], surged to the fore-front of Australian Touring Car racing and Bowe's only win would come at the [[Sandown International Raceway|Sandown]] round of the [[1992 Australian Touring Car Championship]]. Bowe would then go on to finish second with Johnson in the now ageing Sierra at the crash shortened [[1992 Tooheys 1000]].\n\n==V8Supercar==\n{{Infobox V8 Supercar record\n| Car number    = \n| Team          = \n| Races         = 225\n| Championships = 1 ([[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|1995]])\n| Wins          = 15\n| Podiums       = 51\n| Race Wins     = 33\n| Poles         = \n}}\nDJR fortunes reversed in 1993 with the advent of the V8 based regulations that in 1997 would become known as V8 Supercar. The team's new Ford [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] V8s returned to the front with Bowe winning the first round under the new regulations at [[Amaroo Park]]. Bowe would narrowly miss out on second place in the championship. For the 1994 season DJR was initially off the pace until the [[1994 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] where in a race of mixed fortunes Bowe and Johnson won, taking the team's first Sandown 500 win after over 15 years of disappointment. Four weeks later in one of the most dramatic [[1994 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst 1000]]s of all time Bowe and Johnson held off a pursuing pack of five Holdens late in the race to win, with Bowe memorably fighting for the lead with teenage debutante [[Craig Lowndes]] in the final laps.\n\nThe team continued their good form into 1995 where not even the destruction of tyre suppliers Dunlop factory in the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe earthquake]] could stop Bowe from winning the [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship]], taking victories at [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]], a [[Mount Panorama ATCC sprint round|sprint round held at Bathurst]] for the first time since [[1972 Australian Touring Car Championship|1972]], Winton and under terrific pressure from Glenn Seton and [[Peter Brock]], the championship finale at Oran Park. The team went on to win back-to-back [[1995 Sandown 500|Sandown 500s]] but didn't finish at [[1995 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst]] after an accident with Glenn Seton while leading stopped their run on lap 110.\n\nBowe continued to race for DJR for the next three seasons, taking a second sprint victory at Bathurst in 1996, [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside]] in 1997 and Winton in 1998, the last of his 15 Touring Car round victories. Bowe also finished runner up in the [[1996 Australian Touring Car Championship]] and [[1996 AMP Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] to his young rival from two years prior, Craig Lowndes.\n\nBowe moved on to [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] backed West Australian team [[PAE Motorsport]] seeking a new challenge but before the season was out the team had been sold to Queensland car dealer [[Briggs Motor Sport|John Briggs]]. Despite some early promise he was fired from the team after Bathurst in 2001 with just a single race win at [[Queensland Raceway]] in 1999 to show for his efforts.\n\nFrom 2002\u20132006 Bowe and new team-mate [[Brad Jones (racing driver)|Brad Jones]] had mixed fortunes. As with Briggs Motorsport early promise faded as the team struggled to find the resources to regularly threaten the front running teams. Always a threat at Bathurst, Bowe and Jones finished third in [[2004 Bob Jane T-Marts 1000|2004]] and won the second race in the 2005 [[Australian Grand Prix]] non-championship event.\n\n==Retirement==\nAnnouncing his retirement, Bowe raced a final season in 2007 for [[Paul Cruickshank Racing]]. In March 2007 Bowe broke the record for most championship races starts when he started in round 2 at Barbagallo, his 213th start. His race was marred with two spins. His prospects for a glorious final season appear limited as PCR was a single car team and under funded compared to the front running teams. In 2008 Bowe returned to Sports car racing in a [[Lamborghini Gallardo]] in the [[Australian GT Championship]], before securing a full-time drive in 2009 with the [[Touring Car Masters]] series for historic touring cars, driving a [[Chevrolet Camaro]]. 2010 saw John Bowe returning to the Touring Car Masters category driving \"Sally\", his [[Ford Mustang (first generation)#1969\u20131970|1969 Ford Mustang]] (powered by a [[Ford Windsor engine#351W|Ford 351 Windsor]] [[V8 engine]]), with sponsorship from [[WesTrac]] and Wilson Security. Bowe also runs the number 18 on his Mustang, the same number he used when driving for Dick Johnson Racing.\n\nBowe's name has been lent to the John Bowe Trophy, awarded to the winner of the [[Formula 3]] [[Tasmanian Super Prix]].\n\nDriving a [[Ferrari 458 GT3]] for [[Maranello Motorsport]] alongside Craig Lowndes, Peter Edwards, and former [[Formula One]] driver [[Mika Salo]], Bowe was the winner of the [[2014 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour|2014 Bathurst 12 Hour]] on 9 February. It was his third success in the race after winning at [[Eastern Creek Raceway|Eastern Creek]] in [[1995 Eastern Creek 12 Hour|1995]] and at Bathurst in [[2010 Armor All Bathurst 12 Hour|2010]].\n\n==Career results==\n[[File:1969 Ford Mustang of John Bowe (Adelaide 2011).JPG|thumb|The 1969 Ford Mustang of John Bowe \u2013 2011 Touring Car Masters]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

He has also won the prestigious [[Bathurst 1000]] touring car endurance race twice, in [[1989 Bathurst 1000|1989]] and [[1994 Bathurst 1000|1994]]. Both wins were as co-driver with longtime friend and teammate [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] driving for iconic Ford team [[Dick Johnson Racing]].\n\n==Racing Cars==\nBowe began racing at the age of sixteen in Formula Vee [[Elfin Sports Cars|Elfin]] 500 in 1971, winning the Tasmanian state title on debut.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.johnbowe.com.au/jbs-story |title=John Bowe \u2013 Australian Motorsport Champion |publisher=John Bowe Racing |accessdate=16 April 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171026143432/http://www.johnbowe.com.au/jbs-story |archive-date=26 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The following year, he also won the Tasmanian Formula Ford title.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.wilsonsecurityracing.com.au/driver_john_bowe.php |title=Archived copy |access-date=18 January 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119064854/http://www.wilsonsecurityracing.com.au/driver_john_bowe.php |archive-date=19 November 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nAfter graduating from domestic Formula Ford racing Bowe moved into the Australian Drivers Championship in the late 1970s, racing [[Elfin Sports Cars|Elfin]] [[Formula 5000]]s for the most prestigious team of the era, the factory Ansett Team Elfin run by Elfin Sports Cars founder and chief designer [[Garrie Cooper]]. The pinnacle of his Formula 5000 career was finishing runner up in the [[1979 Australian Grand Prix]] driving one of Cooper's [[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet]] V8 powered Elfin MR8s. In the same year he also came second in the [[Australian Formula 2]] Championship.\n\nBowe would finish third in the [[1980 Australian Drivers' Championship]] driving the MR8, and would finish fourth in the [[1980 Australian Formula 2 Championship|Formula 2]] title. He would finish fourth in [[1981 Australian Drivers' Championship|1981]] driving the [[Elfin Sports Cars|Elfin MR9]], the only [[Ground effect (cars)|Ground effects]] F5000 ever built. He also dropped to ninth place in the [[1981 Australian Formula 2 Championship|Formula 2 championship]] driving an Elfin Two-25 [[Volkswagen]].\n\nAfter playing second fiddle to [[Alfredo Costanzo]] for several seasons, Bowe broke through for his first Australian Drivers' Championship in [[1984 Australian Drivers' Championship|1984]], backing it up the [[1985 Australian Drivers' Championship|following year]] with his second title in his [[Cosworth#The BDA series|Ford]] powered [[Ralt RT4]] for Chris Leach. The 1984 and 1985 championships were run under [[Formula Mondial]] regulations.\n\nBowe qualified on the front row for the [[1984 Australian Grand Prix]] at [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder Park]] in [[Melbourne]] and led the race for the first 18 laps before a loose spark plug lead caused the [[Inline 4|4 cyl]] Ford engine to misfire and he was passed by defending race winner [[Roberto Moreno]] of [[Brazil]] who went on to win the race. Bowe finally stopped on lap 33 and rejoined in 13th place. He would fight his way back to 6th place by the end of the race (2 laps down), setting the 3rd fastest race lap behind Moreno's Ralt and the similar car of [[Formula One]] driver [[Andrea de Cesaris]].\n\nBowe's last open wheeler race was in the Formula Mondial support race at the [[1986 Australian Grand Prix]] in [[Adelaide]]. Driving a Ralt RT4 in the race (for the first time in 12 months), Bowe equalled the category lap record for the [[Adelaide Street Circuit]] set one year earlier by American driver [[Ross Cheever]], the younger brother of [[Formula One]] driver [[Eddie Cheever]]. Bowe's time of 1:33.20 for the 3.780&nbsp;km (2.362&nbsp;mi) track compared to the fastest Formula One race lap of the circuit that year of 1:20.78 set by [[Nelson Piquet]] driving a {{Convert|1000|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}} turbocharged [[Williams FW11|Williams]]-[[Honda F1|Honda]].\n\n==Sports Cars==\nJohn Bowe drove the Bryan Thompson\u2013owned [[Mercedes-Benz SLC-Class|Mercedes-Benz 450 SLC]]-[[Chevrolet small-block engine|Chevrolet]] twin-turbo in Sports Sedan and GT events during the early 1980s when Thompson was in retirement, which stopped when Thompson came out of retirement in 1983. The Mercedes with its 4.2-litre Chevrolet engine put out a reported {{Convert|1100|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, but was somewhat unreliable due to the use of smaller turbo's.\n\nIn 1985 while still contesting the Australian drivers' Championship, Bowe was approached by [[Adelaide]]-based photographer and Sports Car racer Bernie Van Elsen to race his new car for the [[Australian Sports Car Championship]] (ASCC). The car, built by K&A Engineering in Adelaide and called a [[Veskanda C1]], was initially powered by an F5000 sourced 5.0-litre Chevrolet [[V8 engine|V8]], though this was changed to a 5.8-litre (350 cui) Chevrolet V8 in 1986 when [[Confederation of Australian Motorsport|CAMS]] increased the engine capacity limit for [[Group A Sports Cars]] from 5000 cc to 6000 cc. The Veskanda is generally regarded as the fastest Sports Car ever designed and built in Australia. In Bowe's talented hands the Veskanda Chev easily won the [[1986 Australian Sports Car Championship]], with the Bowe setting outright lap records (often faster than the [[Open wheel car|open wheelers]]) at circuits around the country. Two of these records will stand forever as the tracks are now closed: [[Amaroo Park]] in [[Sydney]] (set in 1987, track closed in 1998), and the [[Surfers Paradise International Raceway]] (set in 1986, track closed in late 1987).\n\nBowe and the Veskanda finished second in the three round [[1987 Australian Sports Car Championship|1987 ASCC]] after engine reliability troubles saw him retire from the first race at a very wet [[Calder Park Raceway|Calder Park]] in [[Melbourne]]. He then easily won the final two rounds at Amaroo and [[Sandown Raceway|Sandown Park]] to finish nineteen points behind Andy Roberts in his self-designed Roberts SR3. Following the season the car was parked as Bowe was moving full-time into Touring Car Racing in 1988.\n\nVan Elsen entered the Veskanda in the [[1988 360km of Sandown Park|Sandown 360]] which was a round of that year's [[1988 World Sportscar Championship season|1988 World Sports-Prototype Championship]]. Bowe teamed with his Touring Car team owner and teammate [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]] in the Veskanda (the 5.8 litre V8 was replaced for the meeting by a 6.0 litre Chevrolet V8). After qualifying a credible 8th with a time of 1:35.510 (compared to [[Jean Louis Schlesser]]'s pole time of 1:28.620 in his [[Sauber C9]]), the pair completed 87 laps, six less than the winning Sauber C9 of Schlesser and [[Jochen Mass]]. Unlike the [[1984 1000 km of Sandown Park|1984]] [[World Sportscar Championship]] race when Australian sports cars, GT and sports sedans had been permitted to compete in a special class by the [[FIA]], Australian cars were not eligible for the 1988 event. However, although the Veskanda had been built to comply with CAMS Group A rules, it had also been built to the FIA's [[Group C]] sports car rules and was thus free to enter and race.\n\nUltimately the Bowe / Johnson Veskanda, the only Australian car in the 18 car field, was disqualified for using more fuel than the rules allowed.\n\n==Touring Cars==\nBowe's two [[Australian Drivers' Championship|CAMS Gold Stars]] in 1984 and 1985 saw him finally get the attention of the Australian [[Touring Car Racing|touring car]] establishment. In mid-1985 he was contacted by New Zealander Mark Petch to join the [[Mark Petch Motorsport]] [[Volvo 200 Series#240 in motorsport|Volvo 240 Turbo]] team during the [[1985 Australian Endurance Championship]]. Bowe co-drove with the teams lead driver [[Robbie Francevic]] at the [[1985 Castrol 500|Sandown 500]] and the [[1985 James Hardie 1000|Bathurst 1000]]. They were a DNF at Sandown after the differential in the Volvo locked solid underneath Bowe at the entrance to the pits on lap 60 (the car had to be pushed into the pits with the rear end supported by a [[Jack (device)|trolley jack]]). At Bathurst the turbocharged Volvo was considered the only car capable of matching the speed of the three [[Jaguar V12 engine#5.3 Litre|V12]] [[Jaguar XJS]]' run by [[Tom Walkinshaw Racing]]. The Volvo qualified fifth fastest after Hardie's Heroes (set by Francevic), and after running second and third in the early laps, was destined to spend time in the pits having the alternator replaced, losing many laps. The car failed to finish after running out of fuel on lap 122. Despite it being only the second time he had driven the Volvo, and not having previously driven at the [[Mount Panorama Circuit]], Bowe proved to be as quick in the car at Bathurst as Francevic until late in the final qualifying session when the team put on a set of qualifying tyres and Francevic set the third fastest time.\n\nPrior to 1985, Bowe had never driven the Bathurst circuit and before practice started enlisted the services star driver [[Allan Grice]] to show him how to drive the track. Grice was only too happy to show the Bathurst rookie the fast way around the daunting circuit, something Bowe continues to be grateful for.\n\nDuring the [[1986 Australian Touring Car Championship]] the new factory-supported [[Volvo Dealer Team]] replaced the Mark Petch Motorsport outfit and expanded to a second car and Bowe joined Francevic in the team full-time at round four. Bowe proved he could match it with the likes of Francevic, [[Peter Brock]], [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]], [[George Fury]] and [[Jim Richards (racing driver)|Jim Richards]] by qualifying on pole and easily leading the 5th round of the championship at [[Wanneroo Raceway|Wanneroo]] in [[Perth]] until the new Volvo's engine went off song and forced him to retire.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22ckiXuyMjk 1986 ATCC Barbagello Round 5]</ref> Francevic went on to win the championship, with Bowe taking eighth place in the series including a pair of third places at Calder Park and also at [[Oran Park Raceway|Oran Park]] in Sydney. Also in 1986, Bowe raced the Veskanda-Chevrolet Sports car owned by Bernie van Elsen and used it to dominate the [[Australian Sports Car Championship]], along the way setting outright lap records at various tracks around the country.\n\nBowe became the lead driver of the Volvo team after Francevic was fired from the team shortly by team boss John Sheppard after his refusal to drive a newly built car at the [[1986 Castrol 500]] (he was also fired for comments made to the media on race morning which Francevic claimed was aimed at the race officials, but Sheppard took as criticising the team). Once again though, the Volvo proved fragile and unable to effectively threaten for the [[1986 Australian Endurance Championship|1986 endurance races]], though Bowe was able to qualify the Volvo in fifth place for the [[1986 James Hardie 1000]]. The team closed at the end of the season leaving Bowe without a drive for the 1987 season.\n\nHe was picked up by the [[Gibson Motor Sport|Peter Jackson Nissan Racing]] team for the 1987 endurance season, mainly as a co-driver with young sensation [[Glenn Seton]]. The pair finished fourth at Bathurst in the [[Nissan Skyline#RS|Nissan Skyline RS DR30]], and were later promoted to second after the disqualification of the [[Eggenberger Motorsport|Texaco Eggenberger Ford team]]. Although the Nissan's won a number of touring car races in Australia during 1986 and 1987, Bowe would later claim both privately and publicly that the turbocharged [[Inline-four engine|4 cyl]] DR30 Skyline (which had no aerodynamic aids making it very unstable at high speed) was the worst touring car he ever raced, thoughts that were echoed by regular Nissan drivers Seton and [[George Fury]].\n\nBowe's first major touring car win came in the [[1987 Yokohama/Bob Jane T-Marts 300]] at the [[Calder Park Raceway]]. The race was run on the rarely used combined circuit which incorporated both the 1986 redeveloped road course and the newly completed [[NASCAR]]-style \"Thunderdome\" oval. Bowe and [[Sydney]] driver Terry Shiel won the race, the first on the combined course, driving the Peter Jackson team's spare Nissan Skyline RS DR30 from the [[Holden VL Commodore|Holden VL Commodore SS Group A]] of Bowe's former open wheel rival [[Larry Perkins]], and the Commodore's owner [[Bill O'Brien (racing driver)|Bill O'Brien]].<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OL1auARPaDA 1987 Calder Park 300 Highlights]</ref> As of 2016 this is believed to be the only touring car victory for a [[Japan]]ese car on the high-banked Thunderdome.\n\nFor [[1988 Australian Touring Car season|1988]], [[Dick Johnson Racing]] hired Bowe, replacing [[Gregg Hansford]] as the teams number two driver in their [[Ford Sierra RS500]]'s. Team manager [[Neal Lowe]] had completely re-engineered the cars after an embarrassing 1987 endurance season and the [[Royal Dutch Shell|Shell]] backed cars proved to be the class of the field. Bowe won his third race for the team, his first ever ATCC race win, at [[Winton Motor Raceway|Winton]] and would go on to win again at [[Amaroo Park]], finishing second in the [[1988 Australian Touring Car Championship|1988 ATCC]] behind team boss [[Dick Johnson (racing driver)|Dick Johnson]]. The pair salvaged a runner up position at Bathurst in the team's third entry (Bowe's ATCC Sierra) after their two primary cars failed early in the race. After Johnson and Bowe's Sierra's failed, they moved into the No. 18 car which had at that stage been driven by one of Bowe's former open wheel rivals John Smith (another open wheel rival, Alfredo Costanzo, was to be Smith's co-driver but didn't get to drive at Bathurst after Dick and John swapped cars).\n\nAfter the 1988 ATCC, DJR took one Dick's championship winning Sierra to the [[Silverstone Circuit]] to contest the [[RAC Tourist Trophy]]. DJR proved they had the fastest Group A Sierra's in the world when Dick Johnson easily won the pole by just under half a second against the best [[European Touring Car Championship|European]] and [[British Touring Car Championship|British]] opposition. Johnson and Bowe led the race early on and were pulling away from the Eggenberger and [[Andy Rouse]] Sierra's, with Johnson setting the circuits Group A lap record, until the water pump in the car failed and had to be replaced. Rouse would go on to win the race, with the DJR Sierra eventually finishing 21st\n\nThe [[1989 Australian Touring Car season|1989 ATCC]] would prove to be more of the same for Bowe, again finishing runner up to Johnson after taking victories at Amaroo Park and [[Barbagallo Raceway|Wanneroo]]. The [[1989 Tooheys 1000]] at Bathurst was a triumph for Bowe and Johnson, seeing off all challengers on their way to victory, including the Eggenberger built and engineered [[Allan Moffat Racing|Allan Moffat]] Sierra's driven by European aces [[Klaus Niedzwiedz]] and [[Frank Biela]], as well as [[Peter Brock]]'s Rouse built Sierra (with Rouse himself co-driving) which Brock had put on pole position. With the Shell Sierra limping due to failing turbo boost, Bowe drove the car over the finish line at Bathurst, saying to [[ATN|Channel 7]] commentator Mike Raymond \"Fancy doing that\" over [[racecam]] as he did so.\n\nOver the next three seasons his 1987 team Nissan, now running the formidable [[4WD]], twin-turbo [[Nissan Skyline R32|Nissan GT-R]], surged to the fore-front of Australian Touring Car racing and Bowe's only win would come at the [[Sandown International Raceway|Sandown]] round of the [[1992 Australian Touring Car Championship]]. Bowe would then go on to finish second with Johnson in the now ageing Sierra at the crash shortened [[1992 Tooheys 1000]].\n\n==V8Supercar==\n{{Infobox V8 Supercar record\n| Car number    = \n| Team          = \n| Races         = 225\n| Championships = 1 ([[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship|1995]])\n| Wins          = 15\n| Podiums       = 51\n| Race Wins     = 33\n| Poles         = \n}}\nDJR fortunes reversed in 1993 with the advent of the V8 based regulations that in 1997 would become known as V8 Supercar. The team's new Ford [[Ford Falcon (Australia)|Falcon]] V8s returned to the front with Bowe winning the first round under the new regulations at [[Amaroo Park]]. Bowe would narrowly miss out on second place in the championship. For the 1994 season DJR was initially off the pace until the [[1994 Sandown 500|Sandown 500]] where in a race of mixed fortunes Bowe and Johnson won, taking the team's first Sandown 500 win after over 15 years of disappointment. Four weeks later in one of the most dramatic [[1994 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst 1000]]s of all time Bowe and Johnson held off a pursuing pack of five Holdens late in the race to win, with Bowe memorably fighting for the lead with teenage debutante [[Craig Lowndes]] in the final laps.\n\nThe team continued their good form into 1995 where not even the destruction of tyre suppliers Dunlop factory in the [[Great Hanshin earthquake|Kobe earthquake]] could stop Bowe from winning the [[1995 Australian Touring Car Championship]], taking victories at [[Symmons Plains Raceway|Symmons Plains]], a [[Mount Panorama ATCC sprint round|sprint round held at Bathurst]] for the first time since [[1972 Australian Touring Car Championship|1972]], Winton and under terrific pressure from Glenn Seton and [[Peter Brock]], the championship finale at Oran Park. The team went on to win back-to-back [[1995 Sandown 500|Sandown 500s]] but didn't finish at [[1995 Tooheys 1000|Bathurst]] after an accident with Glenn Seton while leading stopped their run on lap 110.\n\nBowe continued to race for DJR for the next three seasons, taking a second sprint victory at Bathurst in 1996, [[Lakeside International Raceway|Lakeside]] in 1997 and Winton in 1998, the last of his 15 Touring Car round victories. Bowe also finished runner up in the [[1996 Australian Touring Car Championship]] and [[1996 AMP Bathurst 1000|Bathurst 1000]] to his young rival from two years prior, Craig Lowndes.\n\nBowe moved on to [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] backed West Australian team [[PAE Motorsport]] seeking a new challenge but before the season was out the team had been sold to Queensland car dealer [[Briggs Motor Sport|John Briggs]]. Despite some early promise he was fired from the team after Bathurst in 2001 with just a single race win at [[Queensland Raceway]] in 1999 to show for his efforts.\n\nFrom 2002\u20132006 Bowe and new team-mate [[Brad Jones (racing driver)|Brad Jones]] had mixed fortunes. As with Briggs Motorsport early promise faded as the team struggled to find the resources to regularly threaten the front running teams. Always a threat at Bathurst, Bowe and Jones finished third in [[2004 Bob Jane T-Marts 1000|2004]] and won the second race in the 2005 [[Australian Grand Prix]] non-championship event.\n\n==Retirement==\nAnnouncing his retirement, Bowe raced a final season in 2007 for [[Paul Cruickshank Racing]]. In March 2007 Bowe broke the record for most championship races starts when he started in round 2 at Barbagallo, his 213th start. His race was marred with two spins. His prospects for a glorious final season appear limited as PCR was a single car team and under funded compared to the front running teams. In 2008 Bowe returned to Sports car racing in a [[Lamborghini Gallardo]] in the [[Australian GT Championship]], before securing a full-time drive in 2009 with the [[Touring Car Masters]] series for historic touring cars, driving a [[Chevrolet Camaro]]. 2010 saw John Bowe returning to the Touring Car Masters category driving \"Sally\", his [[Ford Mustang (first generation)#1969\u20131970|1969 Ford Mustang]] (powered by a [[Ford Windsor engine#351W|Ford 351 Windsor]] [[V8 engine]]), with sponsorship from [[WesTrac]] and Wilson Security. Bowe also runs the number 18 on his Mustang, the same number he used when driving for Dick Johnson Racing.\n\nBowe's name has been lent to the John Bowe Trophy, awarded to the winner of the [[Formula 3]] [[Tasmanian Super Prix]].\n\nDriving a [[Ferrari 458 GT3]] for [[Maranello Motorsport]] alongside Craig Lowndes, Peter Edwards, and former [[Formula One]] driver [[Mika Salo]], Bowe was the winner of the [[2014 Liqui Moly Bathurst 12 Hour|2014 Bathurst 12 Hour]] on 9 February. It was his third success in the race after winning at [[Eastern Creek Raceway|Eastern Creek]] in [[1995 Eastern Creek 12 Hour|1995]] and at Bathurst in [[2010 Armor All Bathurst 12 Hour|2010]].\n\n==Career results==\n[[File:1969 Ford Mustang of John Bowe (Adelaide 2011).JPG|thumb|The 1969 Ford Mustang of John Bowe \u2013 2011 Touring Car Masters]]\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

The victory, however, was not without its share of controversy. Despite not winning a single round overall (though he did win an individual race), or scoring a pole position in any individual race, Kelly entered the final round of the series at [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit|Phillip Island]] seven points ahead of his nearest competitor, [[Craig Lowndes]], (who had won four rounds) due to consistent high points finishes in all twelve of the previous 2006 rounds.\n\nComing into the third and final race of the round, Lowndes had managed to pull back the deficit to be even on points with Kelly, meaning that the driver out of the two who finished first would clinch the championship.  Two laps into the final race, Kelly collided with Lowndes, who then slid into [[Todd Kelly]].  Damage to Lowndes car resulted in him finishing 29th, whereas Rick Kelly finished 18th and was awarded the series title despite not having won a single round.<ref>McKay, Peter (11 December 2006) [http://www.smh.com.au/news/motorsport/kelly-emerges-in-dramatic-finale/2006/12/10/1165685555093.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 Kelly emerges in dramatic finale]</ref><ref>Stanford, James (11 December 2006); [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/motor-racing/stewards-reject-lowndes-appeal/story-e6frfgb6-1111112665685 Stewards reject Lowndes' appeal]; [[The Herald Sun]]</ref>\n\n==Charitable work==\nKelly has joined other publicly known figures in support of the \"Oscar's Law\" campaign, a protest against the factory farming of [[Pet|companion animals]].

The victory, however, was not without its share of controversy. Despite not winning a single round overall (though he did win an individual race), or scoring a pole position in any individual race, Kelly entered the final round of the series at [[Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit|Phillip Island]] seven points ahead of his nearest competitor, [[Craig Lowndes]], (who had won four rounds) due to consistent high points finishes in all twelve of the previous 2006 rounds.\n\nComing into the third and final race of the round, Lowndes had managed to pull back the deficit to be even on points with Kelly, meaning that the driver out of the two who finished first would clinch the championship.  Two laps into the final race, Kelly collided with Lowndes, who then slid into [[Todd Kelly]].  Damage to Lowndes car resulted in him finishing 29th, whereas Rick Kelly finished 18th and was awarded the series title despite not having won a single round.<ref>McKay, Peter (11 December 2006) [http://www.smh.com.au/news/motorsport/kelly-emerges-in-dramatic-finale/2006/12/10/1165685555093.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 Kelly emerges in dramatic finale]</ref><ref>Stanford, James (11 December 2006); [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/motor-racing/stewards-reject-lowndes-appeal/story-e6frfgb6-1111112665685 Stewards reject Lowndes' appeal]; [[The Herald Sun]]</ref>\n\n==Charitable work==\nKelly has joined other publicly known figures in support of the \"Oscar's Law\" campaign, a protest against the factory farming of [[Pet|companion animals]].

Based on a questionnaire sent to ozone therapists, the study concluded that of 5,579,238 ozone applications (treating 384,775 patients) only 27 complications arose that could conceivably be due to \"ozone per se\" (including 1 death and 1 [[amaurosis]]). Thus the side-effect rate attributable to ozone was calculated at 0.0005%. This conclusion was disputed on several grounds: the survey could not be taken as representative, given that 77% of contacted therapists chose not to respond, with unknown motives; the criteria for reporting of incidents was unclear, as was the criteria for determining the subset of these that were attributable to ozone; and the incidence rate should more appropriately be calculated per patient, rather than per treatment, yielding a more worrying incident rate of 0.1\u20130.2%. It was further pointed out that the risks of conventional medicines are weighed against their proven efficacy, so it is unreasonable to accept comparable risks in unproven treatments.<ref name=\"OzonTherapieArbeitsausschusses\">{{cite book |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=2001-03-30 |title=Ozon-Therapie, Ozon-Eigenbluttherapie, Sauerstoff-OzonEigenbluttherapie, Oxyontherapie, Hyperbare Ozontherapie: Zusammenfassender Bericht des Arbeitsausschusses \"\u00c4rztliche Behandlung\" des Bundesausschusses der \u00c4rzte und Krankenkassen |trans-title=Ozone therapy, Autologous ozone blood therapy, Oxygen-ozone autologous blood therapy, Oxyon therapy, Hyperbaric ozone therapy: Summary report of the \"Medical Treatment\" Working Committee of the Federal Committee of Doctors and Health Insurance Companies |url=https://www.g-ba.de/downloads/40-268-248/HTA-Ozon-Therapie.pdf |language=German |location=K\u00f6ln |publisher=Gesch\u00e4ftsf\u00fchrung des Arbeitsausschusses \"\u00c4rztliche Behandlung\" des Bundesausschusses der \u00c4rzte und Krankenkassen}} pp 17-18.</ref><ref name=\"EisenmengerZurOzontherapie\">Eisenmenger W.

Based on a questionnaire sent to ozone therapists, the study concluded that of 5,579,238 ozone applications (treating 384,775 patients) only 27 complications arose that could conceivably be due to \"ozone per se\" (including 1 death and 1 [[amaurosis]]). Thus the side-effect rate attributable to ozone was calculated at 0.0005%. This conclusion was disputed on several grounds: the survey could not be taken as representative, given that 77% of contacted therapists chose not to respond, with unknown motives; the criteria for reporting of incidents was unclear, as was the criteria for determining the subset of these that were attributable to ozone; and the incidence rate should more appropriately be calculated per patient, rather than per treatment, yielding a more worrying incident rate of 0.1\u20130.2%. It was further pointed out that the risks of conventional medicines are weighed against their proven efficacy, so it is unreasonable to accept comparable risks in unproven treatments.<ref name=\"OzonTherapieArbeitsausschusses\">https://www.g-ba.de/downloads/40-268-248/HTA-Ozon-Therapie.pdf pp 17-18.</ref><ref name=\"EisenmengerZurOzontherapie\">Eisenmenger W.

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n===Powerball begins===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n===2009: Florida became host to drawings===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion.

Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in October 2010.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]]/[[Masury, Ohio]] border sold both Mega Millions (via the [[Ohio Lottery]]) and Powerball ([[Pennsylvania]]) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |title=Penn Ohio Lottery & Deli in Sharon, PA 16146 |publisher=Local.post-gazette.com |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203254/http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Illinois]] joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n===2012 format change===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during [[Hurricane Michael]], a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-ran-million-powerball-drawing-out-town</ref>\n\nThe double matrices and probabilities in the game's history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Starting date\n!Pick 5 White Balls from Field of\n!Pick 1 Red Ball from Field of\n!Jackpot chance\n!''Power Play'' multiplier\n|-\n|April 22, 1992\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:54,979,154\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|November 5, 1997\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|March 7, 2001\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1x-5x\n|-\n|October 9, 2002\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:120,526,769\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|August 28, 2005\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:146,107,961\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 7, 2009\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:195,249,054\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 15, 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|-\n|January 19, 2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|October 7, 2015 <ref name=\"cnbc2015\">[https://nddb.coop/ccnddb/1024 Odds are, you won't like this Powerball story]{{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:292,201,338\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x; 10x\u2021\n|}\n\n\u2020''Power Play'' was introduced in 2001.<br />\n\u202110\u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million.<ref name=LotteryWorld2015/>\n\nWhile Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.\n\n===Power Play===\nFor an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n===Prizes and odds===\n\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |title=Powerball - How To Play |publisher=Powerball.com |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115222858/http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |archive-date=January 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\n\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n===Secondary prizes===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n==Notable wins==\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.

Powerball's minimum advertised jackpot is $40 million (annuity); Powerball's annuity is paid in 30 [[graduated payments|graduated installments]] or winners may choose a lump sum payment instead. One lump sum payment will be less than the total of the 30 annual payments because of the [[time value of money]] and also because one check for a much larger sum will be taxed at a greater rate than 30 checks each at a much lower sum will be taxed.\n\nDrawings for Powerball are held every Wednesday and Saturday evening at 10:59 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]].

The game, and name, were changed to Powerball on April 19, 1992; its first drawing was held April 22.\n\n===Powerball begins===\nWhen it was launched in 1992 Powerball became the first game to use two drums. Using two drums to draw numbers from offers more manipulation by simultaneously allowing high jackpot odds, numerous prize levels and low overall odds of winning (as explained later, a ticket can win by matching only one number). The two-drum concept was suggested by Steve Caputo of the Oregon Lottery. The two-drum concept has since been used by ''The Big Game'' (now [[Mega Millions]]) in the US, [[Powerball (Australia)|Australia's Powerball]], [[National Lottery (United Kingdom)|Thunderball]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[Eurojackpot]] and [[EuroMillions]].{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}\n\nThrough 2008, Powerball drawings usually were held at Screenscape Studios in [[West Des Moines, Iowa]]. The drawings' host was longtime Iowa radio personality Mike Pace, who had hosted MUSL drawings since Lotto America began in 1988. In 1996, Powerball went \"on the road\" for the first time, holding five remote drawings at the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] in Atlanta. A few weeks later, Georgia became the only jurisdiction to leave Powerball (Maine, which joined MUSL in 1990, left when Powerball began). In August 1996, Georgia joined the then-new ''The Big Game'', then the other major U.S. lottery group. It planned to sell tickets for ''both'' games for the rest of 1996; but within days Georgia was removed from MUSL, not to return until the 2010 cross-sell expansion.\n\nOn November 2, 1997, the [[Annuity (American)|annuity]] was changed from 20 to 25 yearly payments; the cash option was added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |title=History |publisher=Powerball |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180201013549/http://powerball.com/pb_history.asp |archive-date=2018-02-01 |url-status=dead}}</ref> The annuity comprises 30 graduated payments, increasing 5% annually.\n\nIn 1998, [[Florida Lottery|Florida]] was given permission by its government to participate in a multi-state game. It was set to offer Powerball; but in early 1999, new governor [[Jeb Bush]] prevented Florida from joining since he believed Powerball would hurt the existing Florida Lottery games. In 2008, Governor [[Charlie Crist]] finally allowed Florida to join MUSL, on Jan 4, 2009.\n\nOn March 7, 2001, an optional multiplier (called ''Power Play'') was added, allowing players to multiply non-jackpot winnings by up to five by paying an extra $1 per game. A wheel was introduced to select the ''Power Play'' multiplier for each drawing (the next year, the ''1x'' was removed from the ''Power Play'' wheel.)\n\n===2009: Florida became host to drawings===\nWith the start of Powerball sales in Florida on January 4, 2009 (with its first drawing on January 7), the matrices changed to 5/59 + 1/39 (adding four white ball numbers and dropping three red balls). This changed the jackpot probability from 1:146 million to 1:195 million; the overall probability became 1:35.\n\nBased on statistical projections, the average jackpot win increased from $95 million to $141 million. Over 3.5 million additional prizes were expected to be won yearly due to the change in probability. The starting jackpot increased to $20 million, with minimum rollovers of $5 million. The jackpot contribution increased from 30.3% to 32.5% of total sales. The Power Play option was modified; second prize, usually $200,000, was given an automatic 5x multiplier, making the 5+0 prize $1 million cash. The bonus second prize if the jackpot exceeded its previous record by $25 million, triggered only twice, was eliminated with the 2012 format change.\n\nThe conditions for Florida joining Powerball included a move of the live drawings from Iowa to [[Universal Studios Florida|Universal Studios]] in [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]].{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} The three hosts rotating announcing duties from Universal Studios were Tracy Wiu, Elizabeth Hart and Scott Adams (MUSL headquarters remained in Iowa, where its other draws are held). The wheel that was used to determine the Power Play multiplier was retired when the drawings moved to Florida; a [[Random number generation|random number generator]] (RNG) was used until the 2012 format change.\n\n[[Arkansas Scholarship Lottery|Arkansas]] became the 33rd MUSL member on October 31, 2009,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://arkansasmatters.com/content/news/Lottery_Fulltext?cid=258812 |accessdate=2016-02-09 |df=mdy-all }}{{dead link|date=July 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> the last to join before the 2010 cross-sell expansion. The Ohio Lottery added Powerball on April 16, 2010, it joined [[Mega Millions]] (along with New York) years earlier, when ''The Big Game'' added ''Mega Millions'' to its name.\n\n===2010 cross-sell expansion===\nIn March 2009, it was reported that [[New Jersey]], already a Mega Millions member, sought permission to join Powerball. Shortly after, discussions were revealed about allowing each US lottery to offer both games. On October 13, the Mega Millions consortium and MUSL reached an agreement in principle to cross-sell Mega Millions and Powerball.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |title=Mega Millions Official Home |publisher=Megamillions.com |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=April 14, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714070121/http://megamillions.com/mcenter/pressrelease.asp?newsID=D0CC83C2-97D5-4E0F-9FD4-E6945DCB0B98 |archivedate=July 14, 2011 |df=mdy }}</ref> In November, MUSL signed an agreement to start streaming Powerball drawings online.<ref>[http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 \"Powerball Lottery Drawings to Be Available Live on the Internet\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304101103/http://www.transworldnews.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=137273 |date=March 4, 2016 }}, TransWorldNews, November 9, 2009.

The U.S. Virgin Islands joined Mega Millions in October 2010.\n\nBefore the agreement, the only places that sold both Mega Millions and Powerball tickets were retailers straddling a border; one retailer on the [[Sharon, Pennsylvania]]/[[Masury, Ohio]] border sold both Mega Millions (via the [[Ohio Lottery]]) and Powerball ([[Pennsylvania]]) before the agreement and continued to be the only retailer to sell tickets for both lotteries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |title=Penn Ohio Lottery & Deli in Sharon, PA 16146 |publisher=Local.post-gazette.com |accessdate=September 4, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029203254/http://local.post-gazette.com/penn+ohio+lottery+and+deli.9.118177023p.home.html |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[Illinois]] joining Powerball on the expansion date, it became the second multi-jurisdictional lottery game (after Mega Millions, which Illinois already participated in) whose drawings were carried nationally. Both games' drawings were simulcast via [[Chicago]] cable [[superstation]] [[WGN-TV]] through its national [[WGN America]] feed. WGN-TV aired Illinois Lottery drawings nationally from 1992 to 2015 after acquiring broadcast rights from Chicago's Fox [[owned-and-operated station]] [[WFLD]] in 1988, which took the rights from WGN-TV in 1987. Powerball drawings were aired on WGN-TV and WGN America on Wednesday and Saturday immediately following the station's 9:00 p.m. ([[Central Time Zone|Central Time]]) newscast with the Mega Millions drawings being aired Tue and Fri evenings after the newscast. WGN served as a default carrier of Mega Millions or Powerball where no local television station carries either multi-jurisdictional lottery's drawings.\n\nOn March 13, 2010, New Jersey became the first previous Mega Millions-only member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Powerball ticket. It was worth over $211 million in annuity payments; it was sold in [[Morris Plains, New Jersey|Morris Plains]]. On May 28, 2010, North Carolina became the first previous MUSL member (just before the cross-selling expansion) to produce a jackpot-winning Mega Millions ticket; that jackpot was $12 million (annuity).\n\nOn June 2, 2010, Ohio won a Powerball jackpot; it became the first lottery selling ''either'' Mega Millions ''or'' Powerball (when 2010 began) to provide a jackpot-winning ticket for its newer game. The ticket was worth a $261 million annuity; it was sold in [[Sunbury, Ohio|Sunbury]]. Ohio's second Powerball jackpot-winning ticket, sold for the June 23, 2010 drawing, was part of another first; since Montana also provided a jackpot winner for that drawing, it was the first time a jackpot was shared through lotteries which sold competing games before the cross-selling expansion, as Montana sold only Powerball before the expansion date.\n\n===2012 format change===\nOn January 15, 2012, the price of each basic Powerball play doubled to $2, while PowerPlay games became $3; the minimum jackpot doubled to $40 million.<ref name=\"worldlottery\">{{cite web|url=http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|title=Powerball Lottery Changes for 2012|author=Lotto, Lucy|date=June 30, 2011|publisher=WorldLottery.net|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130823062810/http://www.worldlottery.net/news/powerball-lottery-changes-2012.asp|archivedate=August 23, 2013|url-status=dead|accessdate=September 4, 2013|quote=The first and biggest change to the Powerball Lottery is the introduction of the $40 million base jackpot.

In each game, players select five numbers from a set of 69 white balls and one number from 26 red Powerballs; the red ball number can be the same as one of the white balls. The drawing order of the five white balls is irrelevant; all tickets show the white ball numbers in ascending order. Players cannot use the drawn Powerball to match two of their white numbers, or vice versa. Players can select their own numbers, or have the terminal [[Pseudorandomness|pseudorandomly]] select the numbers (called \"quick pick\", \"easy pick\", etc.).\n\nIn each drawing, winning numbers are selected using two ball machines: one containing the white balls and the other containing the red Powerballs. Five white balls are drawn from the first machine and the red ball from the second machine. Games matching at least three white balls or the red Powerball win.\n\nTwo identical machines are used for each drawing, randomly selected from four sets. The model of machine used is the Halogen, manufactured by Smartplay International of [[Edgewater Park, New Jersey]]. There are eight ball sets (four of each color); one set of each color is randomly selected before a drawing. The balls are mixed by a turntable at the bottom of the machine that propels the balls around the chamber. When the machine selects a ball, the turntable slows to catch it, sends it up the shaft, and then down the rail to the display. (The Florida Lottery is considering switching to a [[random number generator]] in 2019 for its in-state drawings; it is unknown whether Powerball would be affected.) If the onsite location is unavailable, as was the case during [[Hurricane Michael]], a backup machine is located at MUSL headquarters in Iowa.<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2018/10/10/hurricane-michael-ran-million-powerball-drawing-out-town</ref>\n\nThe double matrices and probabilities in the game's history:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Starting date\n!Pick 5 White Balls from Field of\n!Pick 1 Red Ball from Field of\n!Jackpot chance\n!''Power Play'' multiplier\n|-\n|April 22, 1992\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|45\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:54,979,154\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|November 5, 1997\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\u2020\n|-\n|March 7, 2001\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|49\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:80,089,127\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1x-5x\n|-\n|October 9, 2002\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|53\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:120,526,769\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|August 28, 2005\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|55\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|42\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:146,107,961\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 7, 2009\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|39\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:195,249,054\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|January 15, 2012\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|None\n|-\n|January 19, 2014\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|59\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|35\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:175,223,510\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x\n|-\n|October 7, 2015 <ref name=\"cnbc2015\">[https://nddb.coop/ccnddb/1024 Odds are, you won't like this Powerball story]{{Retrieved | accessdate=2015-07-09}}</ref>\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|69\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|26\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|1:292,201,338\n| style=\"text-align:center;\"|2x-5x; 10x\u2021\n|}\n\n\u2020''Power Play'' was introduced in 2001.<br />\n\u202110\u00d7 available if jackpot is under $150 million.<ref name=LotteryWorld2015/>\n\nWhile Mega Millions and Powerball each have similar jackpot odds despite having a different double matrix (Mega Millions is 5/75&nbsp;+&nbsp;1/15), since Powerball is $2 per play, it now takes $584,402,676 (not counting Power Play side bets) on average to produce a jackpot-winning ticket.\n\n===Power Play===\nFor an additional $1 per game, a player may activate the Power Play option. Activating it multiplies lower-tier winnings (base prize $50,000 or less) by up to 5, or 10 when the jackpot is under $150 million. Power Play is drawn separately from the 6 numbers. The 5+0 prize is automatically doubled to $2 million if Power Play is activated.\n\nThe dilemma for players is whether to maximize the chance at the jackpot or increase lower-tier winnings. If a player selects a fixed amount of money to spend on tickets at a certain time, the player will give up one guess of the winning set of numbers every two times this player activates Power Play in respect of one of the purchased tickets.\n\nPower Play, when it began in 2001, was drawn with a special wheel. In 2006 and 2007, MUSL replaced one of the 5\u00d7 spaces on the Power Play wheel with a 10\u00d7. During each month-long promotion, MUSL guaranteed that there would be at least one drawing with a 10\u00d7 multiplier. The promotion returned in 2008; the ball landed in the 10\u00d7 space twice. After being absent in 2009, the 10\u00d7 multiplier returned in May 2010 (after the Power Play drawing was changed to RNG.) The promotion was extended for the only time, as the 10\u00d7 multiplier was not drawn until June 12, 2010. The second prize 5\u00d7 guarantee continued; the 10\u00d7 applied to all non-jackpot prizes, as in previous promotions.\n\nPower Play's success has led to similar multipliers in other games, most notably ''Megaplier'', available through all [[Mega Millions]] members except California. The 2012 Powerball changes resulted in all eight lower-tier levels having \"fixed\" Power Play prizes.<ref name=\"Changes Coming to Powerball\">{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |title=Changes Coming to Powerball... |publisher=Multi-State Lottery Association |accessdate=January 22, 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123094841/http://www.powerball.com/pb_message.asp |archivedate=January 23, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 2014, PowerPlay was modified; it used 30 balls with the following distribution:\n*2x (15)\n*3x (9)\n*4x/5x: 3 each\n\nOn October 4, 2015, PowerPlay changed again, using 42 or 43\u2020 balls as follows:\n*2x (24)\n*3x (13)\n*4x (3)\n*5x (2)\n*10x (1)\u2020\n\n\u2020 10x available when jackpot is under $150 million.\n\n===Prizes and odds===\n\nPayouts as of October 7, 2015:<ref>{{cite web |title=NEW YORK STATE GAMING COMMISSION AMENDMENT OF SECTIONS 5004.9, 5007.2, 5007.13, 5007.15, 5007.16, 5009.2 and 5010.2 OF NEW YORK CODES, RULES AND REGULATIONS TITLE 9, SUBTITLE T, CHAPTER III, SUBCHAPTER A |url=http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |website=New York State Gaming Commission |publisher=New York State Gaming Commission |accessdate=2015-08-02 |page=4 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150824015916/http://www.gaming.ny.gov/pdf/Proposed%20rulemaking%20for%20Powerball%20Amendments%20and%20Amendments%20to%20Other%20Draw%20Game%20Regulations.pdf |archivedate=August 24, 2015 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellspacing=3\n|-\n!Matches\n!Prize{{efn|name=cal|California's prize amounts are always parimutuel because its [[California Penal Code|state penal code]] distinguishes between a \"lottery\" which cannot be broken and a \"banked game\" whose [[Breaking the bank|bank theoretically could be broken]].

Each annuity payment is 5% higher than in the previous year to adjust for inflation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |title=Powerball - How To Play |publisher=Powerball.com |accessdate=January 12, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160115222858/http://www.powerball.com/powerball/pb_howtoplay.asp |archive-date=January 15, 2016 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe advertised estimated jackpot represents the total payments that would be paid to jackpot winner(s) should they accept the annuity option. This estimate is based on the funds accumulated in the jackpot pool rolled over from prior drawings, expected sales for the next drawing, and market interest rates for the securities that would be used to fund the annuity.<ref name=\"powerball.com\" /> The estimated jackpot usually is 32.5% of the (non-''Power Play'') revenue of each base ($1) play, submitted by game members to accumulate into a prize pool to fund the jackpot. If the jackpot is not won in a particular drawing, the prize pool carries over to the next drawing, accumulating until there is a jackpot winner. This prize pool is the cash that is paid to a jackpot winner if they choose cash. If the winner chooses the annuity, current market rates are used to calculate the graduated payment schedule and the initial installment is paid. The remaining funds in the prize pool are invested to generate the income required to fund the remaining installments. If there are multiple jackpot winners for a drawing, the jackpot prize pool is divided equally for all such plays.\n\nMUSL and its members accept all investment risk and are contractually obligated and liable to the winner to make all scheduled payments to annuity winners. If a jackpot ticket is not claimed, the funds in the prize pool are returned to members in proportion to the amount they contributed to the prize pool. The members have different rules regulating how unclaimed funds are used.<ref name=\"powerball.com\"/>\n\nWhen the Powerball jackpot is won, the next jackpot is guaranteed to be $40 million (annuity). If a jackpot is not won, the minimum rollover is $10 million. The cash in the jackpot pool is guaranteed to be the current value of the annuity. If revenue from ticket sales falls below expectations, game members must contribute additional funds to the jackpot pool to cover the shortage; the most likely scenario where this can occur is if the jackpot is won in consecutive drawings.\n\nBecause of the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]] and resulting drop in ticket sales plus the falling interest rates on which annuity prizes were based, Powerball administrators reduced the minimum starting jackpot to $20 million, and the minimum increase to $2 million when the previous jackpot is not won.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leggate |first1=Jim |title=Powerball cuts jackpot amounts amid coronavirus sales drop |url=https://www.foxbusiness.com/money/powerball-cuts-jackpot-amounts-amid-coronavirus-sales-drop |accessdate=13 April 2020 |publisher=Fox Business |date=2 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n=== Claiming prizes ===\n\nA winning ticket must be claimed in the jurisdiction in which it was purchased, regardless of residence. The minimum age to play Powerball is 18, except in Nebraska (19), and Arizona, Iowa, Louisiana and Mississippi (21).\n\nGenerally, Powerball players do not have to choose cash or annuity unless they win a jackpot (then they usually have 60 days to choose). Exceptions include [[Florida]] and [[Missouri]]; the 60-day \"[[clock]]\" starts with the drawing, so a [[Progressive jackpot|jackpot]] winner who wishes to take the cash option needs to make immediate plans to claim their prize. [[New Jersey]] and [[Texas]] require the cash/annuity choice to be made when ''playing''; in New Jersey, an annuity ticket can be changed to cash after winning, while in Texas, the choice is binding. (When the cash option was introduced in 1997, all Powerball players had to make the choice when playing. This regulation was phased out by 1999.) All Powerball prizes must be claimed within a period ranging from 90 days to a year, depending on where the ticket was bought.\n\nPowerball winnings in [[California]] are subject to [[Income tax in the United States#Federal income tax rates for individuals|Federal income tax]] only. There is no state income tax in [[Florida]], [[South Dakota]], [[Texas]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] and [[Wyoming]], and only on interest and dividends in [[Tennessee]] and [[New Hampshire]]. Winnings from tickets purchased outside of one's home state may be subject to the income tax laws of ''both'' states (with possible credit based on the two jurisdictions.)\n\n===Secondary prizes===\nUnlike the jackpot pool, other prizes are the responsibility and liability of each participating lottery. All revenue for Powerball ticket sales not used for jackpots is retained by each member; none of this revenue is shared with other lotteries. Members are liable only for the payment of secondary prizes sold there.\n\nSince the secondary prizes are defined in fixed amounts (except in California), if the liability for a given prize level exceed the funds in the prize pool for that level the amount of the prize may be reduced and the prize pool be distributed on a parimutuel basis and result in a prize lower than the fixed amounts given in the prize tables.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://floridalottery.com/powerball |title=Powerball |publisher=Floridalottery.com |date=January 18, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2016}}</ref> Because the secondary prize pools are calculated independently, it is possible lower-tier prizes will differ among the game members.\n\n==Notable wins==\n{{Main article|Lottery jackpot records#United States}}\nBecause the quoted jackpot amount is an annuity of 30 graduated annual payments, its cash value relative to the annuity fluctuates. The actual ratio depends on projected interest rates and other factors. MUSL starts with the cash value, built from a percentage of sales, and then calculates the advertised jackpot amount from that value, based on the average costs of the three best securities bids.<ref>[http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp \"Why Has the Cash Jackpot Gone Down?\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150806042548/http://www.powerball.com/pb_contact.asp |date=August 6, 2015 }} Powerball Frequently Asked Questions.</ref>\n\nOn March 27, 2019, a single ticket purchased in [[Wisconsin]] was the only winner of a $768.4 million ($477 million cash) Powerball jackpot, the third largest in U.S. lottery history.

He is left-footed and played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], and was also capable of playing at [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]].\n\nDistin began his career playing for French amateur sides in the [[Championnat de France amateur|CFA]], and worked his way up to professional sides [[FC Gueugnon|Gueugnon]] and subsequently [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. He moved to England in 2001, first joining [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on a loan move from PSG, before signing a permanent contract with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], where he spent five seasons. He then spent two years at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] where he won the [[FA Cup]], before joining [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2009. In six seasons at [[Goodison Park]], he made 210 appearances across all competitions, leaving in 2015 for [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]].\n\nAfter one season with Bournemouth, Distin was released when his contract expired in June 2016. He played sixteen consecutive seasons in the [[Premier League]], with over 450 appearances in England's top flight \u2013 the [[List of Premier League players|most of any foreign outfield player]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Players Index|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/players/index.html?paramSearchType=BY_STAT|publisher=Premier League|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Bagnolet]], Distin started his career at French non-league side [[US Jou\u00e9-l\u00e8s-Tours|Jou\u00e9-l\u00e8s-Tours]] before moving to [[Tours FC|Tours]] a year later, where he played 26 times and scored three goals. He then transferred to [[FC Gueugnon|Gueugnon]] of [[Ligue 2]], signing his first professional contract. With Gueugnon he won the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] in 2000. His performances for Gueugnon prompted [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] to sign him, though his time at PSG was short-lived and after a year, Distin went on loan to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] where he made 35 appearances in all competitions.\n\n===Manchester City===\nFollowing the loan spell, Newcastle wanted to sign Distin permanently but he instead opted to sign for Manchester City where he could play in his preferred position of [[defender (football)|central defence]], rather than left-back at Newcastle. The transfer fee was \u00a34&nbsp;million, setting a club record for a defender.

Everton went on to lose the game 2\u20131, and Distin took to Twitter to apologise to the Everton fans.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/sylvaind15tin/status/19117312880057548|title=Twitter post|date=14 April 2012|accessdate=14 April 2012}}</ref> However, he was named Everton's players' player of the year at the end of season awards ceremony,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2012/05/10/distin-wins-players-player |author=Andy Lewis |title=Distin Wins Players' Player |publisher=Everton F.C. |access-date=25 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514014306/http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/2012/05/10/distin-wins-players-player |archive-date=14 May 2012 |url-status=dead |df=dmy }}</ref> and then agreed a one-year contract extension to stay at the club for the [[2012\u201313 Everton F.C. season|2012\u201313 season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18206772 |title=Everton defender Sylvain Distin signs one-year contract |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=25 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525141916/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18206772 |archive-date=25 May 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref>\nOn 24 January 2013, Distin signed a new one-year contract with Everton, keeping him at the club until the summer of 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21179602 |title=Sylvain Distin: Everton defender signs one-year contract |department=BBC Sport |date=24 January 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017185004/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/21179602 |archive-date=17 October 2013 |url-status=live |df=dmy }}</ref> On 23 February, he made his 400th Premier League appearance against [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] at [[Carrow Road]].

He is left-footed and played as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], and was also capable of playing at [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]].\n\nDistin began his career playing for French amateur sides in the [[Championnat de France amateur|CFA]], and worked his way up to professional sides [[FC Gueugnon|Gueugnon]] and subsequently [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. He moved to England in 2001, first joining [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] on a loan move from PSG, before signing a permanent contract with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], where he spent five seasons. He then spent two years at [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] where he won the [[FA Cup]], before joining [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in 2009. In six seasons at [[Goodison Park]], he made 210 appearances across all competitions, leaving in 2015 for [[A.F.C. Bournemouth|AFC Bournemouth]].\n\nAfter one season with Bournemouth, Distin was released when his contract expired in June 2016. He played sixteen consecutive seasons in the [[Premier League]], with over 450 appearances in England's top flight \u2013 the [[List of Premier League players|most of any foreign outfield player]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Players Index|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/players/index.html?paramSearchType=BY_STAT|publisher=Premier League|accessdate=7 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Club career==\n\n===Early career===\nBorn in [[Bagnolet]], Distin started his career at French non-league side [[US Jou\u00e9-l\u00e8s-Tours|Jou\u00e9-l\u00e8s-Tours]] before moving to [[Tours FC|Tours]] a year later, where he played 26 times and scored three goals. He then transferred to [[FC Gueugnon|Gueugnon]] of [[Ligue 2]], signing his first professional contract. With Gueugnon he won the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] in 2000. His performances for Gueugnon prompted [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] to sign him, though his time at PSG was short-lived and after a year, Distin went on loan to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] where he made 35 appearances in all competitions.\n\n===Manchester City===\nFollowing the loan spell, Newcastle wanted to sign Distin permanently but he instead opted to sign for Manchester City where he could play in his preferred position of [[defender (football)|central defence]], rather than left-back at Newcastle.

The follow-up to his most commercially successful album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983), it was written and recorded in mid-1984 at [[Le Studio]] in [[Morin-Heights]], Quebec, Canada following the conclusion of the [[Serious Moonlight Tour]]. Much of the album's sound is the same as its predecessor's, due to Bowie's effort to retain the new audience that he had recently acquired. \n\nThe album was produced by Bowie, Derek Bramble and [[Hugh Padgham]]. Much of Bowie's creative process was the exact same as ''Let's Dance''. Like its predecessor, Bowie played no instruments on ''Tonight'', instead offering little creative input to the musicians during the sessions. He also recorded multiple demos of the tracks beforehand, something collaborator [[Carlos Alomar]] recalled that he rarely did previously. Three songs, including the [[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|title track]], were covers of [[Iggy Pop]] songs, who was present during most of the sessions and co-writer on multiple tracks. The title track features singer [[Tina Turner]].\n\nSupported by the singles \"[[Loving the Alien]]\", \"[[Blue Jean]]\" and the title track, ''Tonight'' was a commercial success, reaching number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It was eventually certified [[Platinum record|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]] and [[Gold disc|gold]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry|British Phonographic Industry (BPI)]]. However, it received mostly poor reviews from music critics, with most noting its lack of creativity. Bowie would express dissatisfaction with it in later years, calling it not one of his stronger efforts. Bowie did not tour in support for the album, and only performed \"Loving the Alien\" and \"Blue Jean\" on subsequent tours. The album was re-mastered in 2018 and included in the box set ''[[Loving the Alien (1983\u20131988)]]''.\n\n==Production==\nDavid Bowie worked on ''Tonight'' after completing his [[Serious Moonlight Tour]] in support of his previous album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]''.<ref name=RSMag84 /> He did not have much luck writing while on tour, so he described the process of recording the album ''Tonight'' this way:\n{{quote|It was rushed. The ''process'' wasn't rushed; we actually took our time recording the thing; ''Let's Dance'' was done in three weeks, ''Tonight'' took five weeks or something, which for me is a really long time. I like to work fast in the studio. There wasn't much of my writing on it 'cause I can't write on tour and I hadn't assembled anything to put out. But I thought it a kind of violent effort at a kind of ''[[Pin Ups]]''.<ref name=MMReview>{{citation |last=Isler |first=Scott |title=David Bowie Opens Up - A Little |journal=Musician |issue=106 |date=August 1987 |pages=60\u201373}}</ref>}}\n\nBowie purposefully sought to keep the sound of the band he had used on the previous album and tour, feeling that the new fans he had accumulated would expect to hear the same thing on the new album that they'd heard before, hence the inclusion of the \"Borneo Horns\" players on the album.<ref name=MM74>{{citation |last=Fricke |first=David |title=David Bowie Interview |journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |issue=74 |date=December 1984 |pages=46\u201356}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen |title=Tonight |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tonight-mw0000189205 |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=24 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nLike ''Let's Dance'', but unlike most previous Bowie albums, Bowie played no instruments on the record, and in fact he delegated almost all responsibility for the music played to his musicians, only occasionally offering critical input.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nBowie brought in Derek Bramble and [[Hugh Padgham]] to produce the record, the former receiving the nod from Bowie due to some of the demos he'd recently produced for English female singer [[Jaki Graham]]. As with ''Let's Dance'', Bowie prepared for the album by recording some demos beforehand, this time showing up with 8 of the 9 songs that would appear on the album. This surprised collaborator [[Carlos Alomar]], who said \"it was the first time in the eleven years that I've been with the damn man that he's brought in anything.\"<ref name=MM74 />\n\n[[Iggy Pop]] spent a good deal of time in the studio with Bowie and the band while the album was being recorded, stating \"I worked extensively on that album. There's a lot more work there than is reflected in just the simple co-writing credit for two songs and some of the old stuff.\" When asked why Bowie included so much Pop-written material on the album, Pop could only guess. \"I think he just wanted the songs heard more,\"<ref name=MM74 /> a sentiment Bowie would mirror when covering Pop's \"[[Bang Bang (Iggy Pop song)|Bang Bang]]\" on his next album, ''[[Never Let Me Down]]''.<ref name=AmsterdamPress>Amsterdam Glass Spider Press Conference, 30 March 1987</ref>\n\n===Track production===\nSome of the demo tracks were not yet named, but they were numbered, called simply \"1,\" \"2\" and \"3.\" \"1\" would turn into the \"irreligious\" album track \"[[Loving the Alien]]\". Bowie described \"Loving the Alien\" as a very personal bit of writing that he did not feel fit in with the rest of the album because it is such a dark song amidst lighter fare. He said, \"\"Alien\" came about because of my feeling that so much history is wrong - as is being rediscovered all the time - and that we base so much on the wrong knowledge that we've gleaned.\"<ref name=RSMag84 /> Bowie cut the demo for the song in [[Montreux]], Switzerland, with a guitarist and a drummer he had drafted from a local Swiss band.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nDemo songs \"2\" and \"3\" were not finished for the album, much to Padgham's regret. He said:\n\n{{quote|They were really just jams. David had some riffs on a tape, in his head, and the band would jam on them and we'd make a bit of a song out of it. But they were quite raunchy songs. At one point, David asked me what my least favourite song out of the eleven or twelve we had was, and I said 'Blue Jean.' I thought it was a bit lightweight. I would have rather had \"2\" in its place. I couldn't tell you why he didn't put them on the album. But I would have loved to have finished them.<ref name=MM74 />}}\n\nThree songs were covers of older Iggy Pop songs: \"Don't Look Down\", \"[[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]\" and \"Neighborhood Threat\", the latter of which stands out as a track Bowie wished he had not done, with him later calling it \"disastrous\". \"That's one I wish I'd never touched, or at least touched it differently. It went totally wrong. It sounded so tight and compromised, and it was such a gas doing it. It was the wrong band to do it with -- wonderful band, but it wasn't quite right for that song.\"<ref name=MMReview />\n\n\"Tumble and Twirl\", co-written with Pop, recounts the pair's exploits while vacationing in the Indonesian islands [[Bali]] and [[Java]] after Bowie's previous tour had ended.<ref name=RSMag84 /><ref name=MM74 />\n\n\"Don't Look Down\", which was one of Bowie's returns to a [[reggae]]-style track (after ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'''s \"[[Yassassin]]\"), perplexed Bowie: \"I tried it every which way. I tried it [[jazz-rock]], I tried it as a [[March (music)|march]], and then I just hit on an old [[ska]]-sounding beat, and it picked up life. Taking energy away from the musical side reinforced the lyrics and gave them their own energy. I think working with Derek Bramble helped because he played propper reggae bass lines.\"\n\nFor \"[[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]\", the title track and the other reggae-style track on the album, Bowie eliminated Pop's original spoken word introduction, calling it an \"idiosyncratic thing\" of Pop's that \"seemed not part of my vocabulary. ... I guess [removing the spoken introduction] changed the whole sentiment around. It still has that same barren feeling, but it's out of that specific area that I'm not at home in.\"<ref name=RSMag84 /> Pop approved of Bowie's changes. For the vocals to the song, Bowie and [[Tina Turner]] sang face-to-face, although Bowie went back and re-recorded the first verse after deciding to sing his part in a higher octave.<ref name=MM74 />\n\n\"Dancing with the Big Boys\", which Bowie also co-wrote with Pop, was written and recorded in eight hours as they egged each other on. In what was described as an \"exhilarating rush\", Bowie and Pop \"went in [to the studio] with a few bottles of beer and would virtually bellow out anything that came into their heads,\" said Padgham. \"And I just recorded it all.\" The song is about the \"little guy\" being crushed by \"oppressive corporate structures.\" The lyrics were taken from a backlog of unused lyrics; the line \"this dot marks your location\" was a reference to a \"lengthy irritating stay\" at a New York Hotel (Bowie had been looking at the hotel room's fire escape map), and \"Your family is a football team\" was a reference to the immigrant families working in New York; \"the whole family [has] to work together for survival.\"<ref name=MM74 /> The track elicited this from Bowie:\n{{quote|There's a particular sound I'm after that I haven't really got yet; I'll either crack it on the next album or retire from it. I think I got quite close to it on \"Dancing with the Big Boys.\" ... I got very ''musical'' over the last couple of years - trying to write musically and develop things the way people used to write in the Fifties. I stayed away from experimentation. Now, I think I should be a bit more adventurous. And in \"Big Boys,\" Iggy and I broke away from all that for one track, and it came nearer to the sound I was looking for than anything else.<ref name=RSMag84 />}}\n\n==Singles and videos==\nThree singles were released from the album: \"[[Tonight (David Bowie song)|Tonight]]\", \"[[Blue Jean (song)|Blue Jean]]\" and \"[[Loving the Alien]]\". \"Blue Jean\" in turn spawned several videos, including an \"elaborate\" 20-minute-long collaboration with [[Julien Temple]] which was described as more of a \"minifilm\" than a video, and represented Bowie's interest in making actual movies.<ref name=RSMag84 />\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r714078|pure_url=yes}}</ref>\n| rev2      = [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]\n| rev2score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) }}</ref>\n| rev3      = [[MusicHound]]\n| rev3Score = 1/5<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel (eds)|title=MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=1999|isbn=1-57859-061-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151 151]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151}}</ref>\n| rev4      = ''[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev4Score = 4.3/10<ref>{{cite web|last=O\u2019Leary|first=Chris|title=David Bowie: Loving the Alien|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-bowie-loving-the-alien-1983-1988/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=20 October 2018|accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n| rev5      = [[Robert Christgau]]\n| rev5Score = {{Rating-Christgau|C}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=david+bowie |title=CG: david bowie |publisher=Robert Christgau |accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>\n| rev6      = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev6Score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |title=David Bowie: Album Guide |publisher=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530073307/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |archivedate=30 May 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>\n}}\nDespite some positive reviews of the album,<ref name=MM74Review>\"Learning to love the Alien: Bowie haunts a calculated, kaleidoscopic seance\" by Timothy White, Musician magazine, December 1984, pages 98-99</ref> other reviewers criticised it for lacking creativity.<ref name=RSMag84 /> Padgham, who co-produced the album, also said that it was less innovative than other Bowie albums.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nAn article for ''[[Melody Maker]]'' later dismissed ''Tonight'' as \"rotten\".<ref name=MM90>\"Bowie: Boys Keep Swinging,\" Melody Maker magazine, 24 March 1990, pp 24-26</ref> [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called it \"one of the weakest albums Bowie ever recorded\" and wrote that \"none of the material equals the songs on ''Let's Dance''\", although he made an exception for \"Blue Jean\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' described ''Tonight'' as \"an expensive quickie padded with lame covers\".<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nathan Brackett|editor2=Christian Hoard|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/99 99]|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0743201698|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/99}}</ref> [[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated in a retrospective of Bowie's career in 2016: \"''Let\u2019s Dance''... had its moments ...

released on 29 September 1984 by [[EMI America Records]]. The follow-up to his most commercially successful album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]'' (1983), it was written and recorded in mid-1984 at [[Le Studio]] in [[Morin-Heights]], Quebec, Canada following the conclusion of the [[Serious Moonlight Tour]]. Much of the album's sound is the same as its predecessor's, due to Bowie's effort to retain the new audience that he had recently acquired. \n\nThe album was produced by Bowie, Derek Bramble and [[Hugh Padgham]]. Much of Bowie's creative process was the exact same as ''Let's Dance''. Like its predecessor, Bowie played no instruments on ''Tonight'', instead offering little creative input to the musicians during the sessions. He also recorded multiple demos of the tracks beforehand, something collaborator [[Carlos Alomar]] recalled that he rarely did previously. Three songs, including the [[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|title track]], were covers of [[Iggy Pop]] songs, who was present during most of the sessions and co-writer on multiple tracks. The title track features singer [[Tina Turner]].\n\nSupported by the singles \"[[Loving the Alien]]\", \"[[Blue Jean]]\" and the title track, ''Tonight'' was a commercial success, reaching number one on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. It was eventually certified [[Platinum record|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA)]] and [[Gold disc|gold]] by the [[British Phonographic Industry|British Phonographic Industry (BPI)]]. However, it received mostly poor reviews from music critics, with most noting its lack of creativity. Bowie would later express dissatisfaction with it, calling it not one of his stronger efforts. Bowie did not tour in support for the album, and only performed \"Loving the Alien\" and \"Blue Jean\" on subsequent tours. The album was re-mastered in 2018 and included in the box set ''[[Loving the Alien (1983\u20131988)]]''.\n\n==Production==\nDavid Bowie worked on ''Tonight'' after completing his [[Serious Moonlight Tour]] in support of his previous album ''[[Let's Dance (David Bowie album)|Let's Dance]]''.<ref name=RSMag84 /> He did not have much luck writing while on tour, so he described the process of recording the album ''Tonight'' this way:\n{{quote|It was rushed. The ''process'' wasn't rushed; we actually took our time recording the thing; ''Let's Dance'' was done in three weeks, ''Tonight'' took five weeks or something, which for me is a really long time. I like to work fast in the studio. There wasn't much of my writing on it 'cause I can't write on tour and I hadn't assembled anything to put out. But I thought it a kind of violent effort at a kind of ''[[Pin Ups]]''.<ref name=MMReview>{{citation |last=Isler |first=Scott |title=David Bowie Opens Up - A Little |journal=Musician |issue=106 |date=August 1987 |pages=60\u201373}}</ref>}}\n\nBowie purposefully sought to keep the sound of the band he had used on the previous album and tour, feeling that the new fans he had accumulated would expect to hear the same thing on the new album that they'd heard before, hence the inclusion of the \"Borneo Horns\" players on the album.<ref name=MM74>{{citation |last=Fricke |first=David |title=David Bowie Interview |journal=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician]] |issue=74 |date=December 1984 |pages=46\u201356}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Erlewine |first=Stephen |title=Tonight |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/tonight-mw0000189205 |publisher=AllMusic |accessdate=24 June 2013}}</ref>\n\nLike ''Let's Dance'', but unlike most previous Bowie albums, Bowie played no instruments on the record, and in fact he delegated almost all responsibility for the music played to his musicians, only occasionally offering critical input.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nBowie brought in Derek Bramble and [[Hugh Padgham]] to produce the record, the former receiving the nod from Bowie due to some of the demos he'd recently produced for English female singer [[Jaki Graham]]. As with ''Let's Dance'', Bowie prepared for the album by recording some demos beforehand, this time showing up with 8 of the 9 songs that would appear on the album. This surprised collaborator [[Carlos Alomar]], who said \"it was the first time in the eleven years that I've been with the damn man that he's brought in anything.\"<ref name=MM74 />\n\n[[Iggy Pop]] spent a good deal of time in the studio with Bowie and the band while the album was being recorded, stating \"I worked extensively on that album. There's a lot more work there than is reflected in just the simple co-writing credit for two songs and some of the old stuff.\" When asked why Bowie included so much Pop-written material on the album, Pop could only guess. \"I think he just wanted the songs heard more,\"<ref name=MM74 /> a sentiment Bowie would mirror when covering Pop's \"[[Bang Bang (Iggy Pop song)|Bang Bang]]\" on his next album, ''[[Never Let Me Down]]''.<ref name=AmsterdamPress>Amsterdam Glass Spider Press Conference, 30 March 1987</ref>\n\n===Track production===\nSome of the demo tracks were not yet named, but they were numbered, called simply \"1,\" \"2\" and \"3.\" \"1\" would turn into the \"irreligious\" album track \"[[Loving the Alien]]\". Bowie described \"Loving the Alien\" as a very personal bit of writing that he did not feel fit in with the rest of the album because it is such a dark song amidst lighter fare. He said, \"\"Alien\" came about because of my feeling that so much history is wrong - as is being rediscovered all the time - and that we base so much on the wrong knowledge that we've gleaned.\"<ref name=RSMag84 /> Bowie cut the demo for the song in [[Montreux]], Switzerland, with a guitarist and a drummer he had drafted from a local Swiss band.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nDemo songs \"2\" and \"3\" were not finished for the album, much to Padgham's regret. He said:\n\n{{quote|They were really just jams. David had some riffs on a tape, in his head, and the band would jam on them and we'd make a bit of a song out of it. But they were quite raunchy songs. At one point, David asked me what my least favourite song out of the eleven or twelve we had was, and I said 'Blue Jean.' I thought it was a bit lightweight. I would have rather had \"2\" in its place. I couldn't tell you why he didn't put them on the album. But I would have loved to have finished them.<ref name=MM74 />}}\n\nThree songs were covers of older Iggy Pop songs: \"Don't Look Down\", \"[[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]\" and \"Neighborhood Threat\", the latter of which stands out as a track Bowie wished he had not done, with him later calling it \"disastrous\". \"That's one I wish I'd never touched, or at least touched it differently. It went totally wrong. It sounded so tight and compromised, and it was such a gas doing it. It was the wrong band to do it with -- wonderful band, but it wasn't quite right for that song.\"<ref name=MMReview />\n\n\"Tumble and Twirl\", co-written with Pop, recounts the pair's exploits while vacationing in the Indonesian islands [[Bali]] and [[Java]] after Bowie's previous tour had ended.<ref name=RSMag84 /><ref name=MM74 />\n\n\"Don't Look Down\", which was one of Bowie's returns to a [[reggae]]-style track (after ''[[Lodger (album)|Lodger]]'''s \"[[Yassassin]]\"), perplexed Bowie: \"I tried it every which way. I tried it [[jazz-rock]], I tried it as a [[March (music)|march]], and then I just hit on an old [[ska]]-sounding beat, and it picked up life. Taking energy away from the musical side reinforced the lyrics and gave them their own energy. I think working with Derek Bramble helped because he played propper reggae bass lines.\"\n\nFor \"[[Tonight (Iggy Pop song)|Tonight]]\", the title track and the other reggae-style track on the album, Bowie eliminated Pop's original spoken word introduction, calling it an \"idiosyncratic thing\" of Pop's that \"seemed not part of my vocabulary. ... I guess [removing the spoken introduction] changed the whole sentiment around. It still has that same barren feeling, but it's out of that specific area that I'm not at home in.\"<ref name=RSMag84 /> Pop approved of Bowie's changes. For the vocals to the song, Bowie and [[Tina Turner]] sang face-to-face, although Bowie went back and re-recorded the first verse after deciding to sing his part in a higher octave.<ref name=MM74 />\n\n\"Dancing with the Big Boys\", which Bowie also co-wrote with Pop, was written and recorded in eight hours as they egged each other on. In what was described as an \"exhilarating rush\", Bowie and Pop \"went in [to the studio] with a few bottles of beer and would virtually bellow out anything that came into their heads,\" said Padgham. \"And I just recorded it all.\" The song is about the \"little guy\" being crushed by \"oppressive corporate structures.\" The lyrics were taken from a backlog of unused lyrics; the line \"this dot marks your location\" was a reference to a \"lengthy irritating stay\" at a New York Hotel (Bowie had been looking at the hotel room's fire escape map), and \"Your family is a football team\" was a reference to the immigrant families working in New York; \"the whole family [has] to work together for survival.\"<ref name=MM74 /> The track elicited this from Bowie:\n{{quote|There's a particular sound I'm after that I haven't really got yet; I'll either crack it on the next album or retire from it. I think I got quite close to it on \"Dancing with the Big Boys.\" ... I got very ''musical'' over the last couple of years - trying to write musically and develop things the way people used to write in the Fifties. I stayed away from experimentation. Now, I think I should be a bit more adventurous. And in \"Big Boys,\" Iggy and I broke away from all that for one track, and it came nearer to the sound I was looking for than anything else.<ref name=RSMag84 />}}\n\n==Singles and videos==\nThree singles were released from the album: \"[[Tonight (David Bowie song)|Tonight]]\", \"[[Blue Jean (song)|Blue Jean]]\" and \"[[Loving the Alien]]\". \"Blue Jean\" in turn spawned several videos, including an \"elaborate\" 20-minute-long collaboration with [[Julien Temple]] which was described as more of a \"minifilm\" than a video, and represented Bowie's interest in making actual movies.<ref name=RSMag84 />\n\n==Critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1      = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r714078|pure_url=yes}}</ref>\n| rev2      = [[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]\n| rev2score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]] |publisher=[[Omnibus Press]] |edition=5th concise |year=2011 |last=Larkin |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer) }}</ref>\n| rev3      = [[MusicHound]]\n| rev3Score = 1/5<ref>{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=Gary|last2=Durchholz|first2=Daniel (eds)|title=MusicHound Rock: The Essential Album Guide|publisher=Visible Ink Press|location=Farmington Hills, MI|year=1999|isbn=1-57859-061-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151 151]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9781578590612/page/151}}</ref>\n| rev4      = ''[[Pitchfork (magazine)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev4Score = 4.3/10<ref>{{cite web|last=O\u2019Leary|first=Chris|title=David Bowie: Loving the Alien|url=https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/david-bowie-loving-the-alien-1983-1988/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=20 October 2018|accessdate=20 October 2018}}</ref>\n| rev5      = [[Robert Christgau]]\n| rev5Score = {{Rating-Christgau|C}}<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/get_artist.php?name=david+bowie |title=CG: david bowie |publisher=Robert Christgau |accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>\n| rev6      = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev6Score = {{Rating|1|5}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |title=David Bowie: Album Guide |publisher=[[Rolling Stone|rollingstone.com]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530073307/http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/david-bowie/albumguide |archivedate=30 May 2011 |accessdate=13 January 2016}}</ref>\n}}\nDespite some positive reviews of the album,<ref name=MM74Review>\"Learning to love the Alien: Bowie haunts a calculated, kaleidoscopic seance\" by Timothy White, Musician magazine, December 1984, pages 98-99</ref> other reviewers criticised it for lacking creativity.<ref name=RSMag84 /> Padgham, who co-produced the album, also said that it was less innovative than other Bowie albums.<ref name=MM74 />\n\nAn article for ''[[Melody Maker]]'' later dismissed ''Tonight'' as \"rotten\".<ref name=MM90>\"Bowie: Boys Keep Swinging,\" Melody Maker magazine, 24 March 1990, pp 24-26</ref> [[AllMusic]] critic [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] called it \"one of the weakest albums Bowie ever recorded\" and wrote that \"none of the material equals the songs on ''Let's Dance''\", although he made an exception for \"Blue Jean\".<ref name=\"allmusic\"/> ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]'' described ''Tonight'' as \"an expensive quickie padded with lame covers\".<ref>{{cite book|editor1=Nathan Brackett|editor2=Christian Hoard|title=The New Rolling Stone Album Guide|year=2004|page=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/99 99]|publisher=Simon & Schuster Ltd|isbn=978-0743201698|url=https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/99}}</ref> [[Alexis Petridis]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated in a retrospective of Bowie's career in 2016: \"''Let\u2019s Dance''... had its moments ...

The premise of the novel relies on a future set in a future dystopian world in which everyone is turned \"Pretty\" by extreme cosmetic surgery upon reaching age 16. It tells the story of teenager Tally Youngblood who rebels against society's enforced conformity in hopes of exposing the societies dangerous obsessions with perfection and uniformity.\n\n==Plot==\nThe book begins with Tally, the main protagonist, as a Pretty debating what to wear to a bash. While attending the bash at which she is to be voted into the \"Crims\" clique, she is followed by someone who appears to be a \"Special\", a member of Special Circumstances. She soon finds him and discovers it\u2019s Croy, a Smokey she knew before she turned pretty. He then told her that he left a note for Tally somewhere in Valentino Mansion.Then he went back to The Smoke and Tally tried to follow him by pushing Peris off the balcony where the bungee bounced, and kneed her head hard enough to make her bleed and was voted into the Crims by the bubbly movement.\n\nTally returns to her care-free life as a Pretty. Her peace is disrupted when Zane, who is the leader of the Crims, asks her about David, whom she loved while she lived in the Smoke. Zane and Tally kiss and fall in love.\n\nZane had once known Croy and had been determined to escape to the Smoke before his surgery. He regrets that he didn't go into the wilderness then. Zane is eager to accompany Tally to find the object Croy has hidden for her. They face strenuous, dangerous physical challenges in order to locate the item, which is accompanied by a letter from Tally to herself, written before she went under the knife. The letter explained to her future self why she had become a Pretty \u2013 to take two pills that will cure her from the foggy-headed life of a Pretty. Tally was afraid to take the pills alone so she and Zane split it right before Special Circumstances came and gave them cuffs like interface rings, but they can't come off.\n\nAfter taking the pills Zane starts getting bad headaches, but he seems to be more cured than Tally. Then one day the Crims pull a bubbly trick by using alcohol to melt a hovering ice rink and crash a soccer game, causing the clique to become famous. Later that night at the bonfire, Shay and Tally get into a huge fight causing Shay to turn on Tally. After that Dr. Cable offers Tally a job as a Special, which she immediately turns down.\n\nWhen Tally and Zane go to Uglyville they find Sussy and Dex, two uglies who helped Tally and David back when she was a Smokey. Tally takes Zane to the hospital but soon finds out that Shay has started a clique with Crim rejects called Cutters, where they cut themselves to cure the lesions.\n\nZane and Tally soon get to decide to escape the city with a few other Crims. Fausto helps Zane and Tally get the cuff off, and they soon escape the city by hoverboarding out of a hot-air balloon. Tally's hoverboard broke so she had to walk on foot to find Zane.\n\nPeris, Tally's friend from her Ugly days, decides in the balloon that he does not want to go to the New Smoke. He stalls for Tally, and she falls into a reservation with rather primitive people who seem to be very violent. She is considered a god there because of her beauty. There she meets Andrew Simpson Smith, the village holy man, who is the only one who speaks her language, which they call the language of the gods, with significant fluency. Andrew tries to help her reach the Rusty Ruins, though he says that they are beyond the end of the world. Through their travels, Tally comes to deduce that the villagers are living in a forcefield-protected reservation where Specials and Pretty Scientists conduct experiments about violence and ways to reduce mankind's violent nature. During this time, Tally starts to wonder if Dr. Cable's words to her have some truth - perhaps the Pretty operation that clouds everyone's minds is the only way that humans can live in peace, without destroying each other or the planet.\n\nTally steals a hovercar from the visiting scientists to escape to the Rusty Ruins. When she calls, she sees someone coming down on a hover board and is shocked to find that it is David who has come to take her to the New Smoke. When she arrives, Maddy tells her that the pills she and Zane took separately were meant to be taken together. One of the pills contained the nanos that were supposed to eat away the lesions, but they ate more of Zane\u2019s brain tissue than the lesions because they needed the pill that Tally took to stop them.

The premise of the novel relies on a future set in a future dystopian world in which everyone is turned \"Pretty\" by extreme cosmetic surgery upon reaching age 16. It tells the story of teenager Tally Youngblood who rebels against society's enforced conformity.\n\n==Plot==\nThe book begins with Tally, the main protagonist, as a Pretty debating what to wear to a bash. While attending the bash at which she is to be voted into the \"Crims\" clique, she is followed by someone who appears to be a \"Special\", a member of Special Circumstances. She soon finds him and discovers it\u2019s Croy, a Smokey she knew before she turned pretty. He then told her that he left a note for Tally somewhere in Valentino Mansion.Then he went back to The Smoke and Tally tried to follow him by pushing Peris off the balcony where the bungee bounced, and kneed her head hard enough to make her bleed and was voted into the Crims by the bubbly movement.\n\nTally returns to her care-free life as a Pretty. Her peace is disrupted when Zane, who is the leader of the Crims, asks her about David, whom she loved while she lived in the Smoke. Zane and Tally kiss and fall in love.\n\nZane had once known Croy and had been determined to escape to the Smoke before his surgery. He regrets that he didn't go into the wilderness then. Zane is eager to accompany Tally to find the object Croy has hidden for her. They face strenuous, dangerous physical challenges in order to locate the item, which is accompanied by a letter from Tally to herself, written before she went under the knife. The letter explained to her future self why she had become a Pretty \u2013 to take two pills that will cure her from the foggy-headed life of a Pretty. Tally was afraid to take the pills alone so she and Zane split it right before Special Circumstances came and gave them cuffs like interface rings, but they can't come off.\n\nAfter taking the pills Zane starts getting bad headaches, but he seems to be more cured than Tally. Then one day the Crims pull a bubbly trick by using alcohol to melt a hovering ice rink and crash a soccer game, causing the clique to become famous. Later that night at the bonfire, Shay and Tally get into a huge fight causing Shay to turn on Tally. After that Dr. Cable offers Tally a job as a Special, which she immediately turns down.\n\nWhen Tally and Zane go to Uglyville they find Sussy and Dex, two uglies who helped Tally and David back when she was a Smokey. Tally takes Zane to the hospital but soon finds out that Shay has started a clique with Crim rejects called Cutters, where they cut themselves to cure the lesions.\n\nZane and Tally soon get to decide to escape the city with a few other Crims. Fausto helps Zane and Tally get the cuff off, and they soon escape the city by hoverboarding out of a hot-air balloon. Tally's hoverboard broke so she had to walk on foot to find Zane.\n\nPeris, Tally's friend from her Ugly days, decides in the balloon that he does not want to go to the New Smoke. He stalls for Tally, and she falls into a reservation with rather primitive people who seem to be very violent. She is considered a god there because of her beauty. There she meets Andrew Simpson Smith, the village holy man, who is the only one who speaks her language, which they call the language of the gods, with significant fluency. Andrew tries to help her reach the Rusty Ruins, though he says that they are beyond the end of the world. Through their travels, Tally comes to deduce that the villagers are living in a forcefield-protected reservation where Specials and Pretty Scientists conduct experiments about violence and ways to reduce mankind's violent nature. During this time, Tally starts to wonder if Dr. Cable's words to her have some truth - perhaps the Pretty operation that clouds everyone's minds is the only way that humans can live in peace, without destroying each other or the planet.\n\nTally steals a hovercar from the visiting scientists to escape to the Rusty Ruins. When she calls, she sees someone coming down on a hover board and is shocked to find that it is David who has come to take her to the New Smoke. When she arrives, Maddy tells her that the pills she and Zane took separately were meant to be taken together. One of the pills contained the nanos that were supposed to eat away the lesions, but they ate more of Zane\u2019s brain tissue than the lesions because they needed the pill that Tally took to stop them. Tally, in fact, cured herself, since the pill that she took only stopped nanos; it did not contain nanos itself to heal the lesions.\n\nThey soon discover that, when Zane went to the hospital for his headaches, a tracker chip was put in his tooth. Tally decides to stay with Zane instead of escaping with David. David believes that she only loves Zane because he is a Pretty. To make David leave and not get caught himself, Tally tells him to \"get his ugly face out of here\". It has the desired result and he flees. She stays with Zane which leads to her getting caught by the Specials along with Fausto. She discovers Shay has been turned into a Special.
