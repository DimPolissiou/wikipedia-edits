Some species will not survive hibernation at temperatures that exceed 4&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref name=\":52\" />\n\nGenerally, for amphibians that hibernate under ice, it is necessary for the animal to be submerged in water that is 10 to 15&nbsp;cm deep and to maintain the temperature between 2 and 3&nbsp;\u00b0C and not above 4&nbsp;\u00b0C. Water should be well aerated, with maintained low-intensity light levels and minimal disturbance of the amphibians.\n\n===Frogs===\nLike other amphibians, frogs show minimal capacities for freezing tolerance and survive winter by using terrestrial hibernacula where they avoid freezing. However, frogs may exhibit greater freeze-tolerance capacity at high latitude range limits, where winter climate is more severe. For example, data suggests that while [[cricket frog]]s in South Dakota survive winter by locating hibernacula that prevent freezing, their toleration of short freezing bouts may expand the range of suitable hibernacula.<ref name=\":62\" /> However, overwinter mortality may be high at the northern range boundary due to colder temperatures and might limit cricket frogs from expanding their range northward.<ref name=\":62\" />\n\nThe microclimate refers to the climate of a very small or restricted area, like the hibernaculum, especially when this differs from the climate of the surrounding area. Overwinter survival in these cricket frogs among other frogs is dependent on using hibernacula with appropriate physical microclimate characteristics, such as moist soil, that buffer frogs from temperatures that drop below the freezing point of the body fluids for extended periods.<ref name=\":62\" /> Although, determining if frogs can identify sites with appropriate microclimates to support overwinter survival and what factors might inform such choices are still unknown and will require further study. Therefore, it is still not known to what extent various types of prospective hibernacula for frogs might be suitable in the years to come, especially factoring in climate change.\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg|thumb|Alpine newt hibernating in dead wood]]\n\n===Newts===\nAs part the Highways Agency Biodiversity Action Plan (HABAP) in the UK, the Species Action Plan (SAP) for [[Northern crested newt|great crested newts]] aims to maintain and enhance existing newt populations through appropriate management of suitable habitat. As part of steps to implement the HABAP, newt hibernacula (e.g. log piles) have been constructed to improve the quality of the terrestrial habitat through increasing the number of potential overwintering sites.<ref name=\":72\">{{Cite journal|last=Knowles|first=Mark|last2=Latham|first2=Dorian|year=2008|title=Assessing the use of artificial hibernacula by great crested newts ''Triturus cristatus'' and other amphibians for habitat enhancement, Northumberland, England |url=http://www.conservationevidence.com/individual-study/2284|journal=Conservation Evidence |volume=5|pages=74\u201379|via=}}</ref> It was also determined that habitat surrounding breeding ponds with plenty of cover and suitable overwintering sites may have less need for provision of artificial hibernacula than landscapes with less woodland, hedgerows, scrub etc.<ref name=\":72\" /> Because great crested newts show high loyalty to over-wintering locations, returning to such established areas year after year, artificial hibernacula could be important in future years to conserve newts and other amphibians.<ref name=\":72\" /> Although, monitoring in the vicinity of these hibernacula in autumn using felt roofing tiles did not reveal the presence of any great crested newts even though they are known to breed in nearby ponds.<ref name=\":72\" /> Common toads and frogs did surround the area however. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted in order to create species-appropriate artificial hibernacula.\n\n== Reptiles ==\nMany reptiles undergo hibernation or a process called [[brumation]], which is similar to hibernation; both processes require usage of a hibernaculum. Staying inside an insulated hibernaculum is a strategy to avoid the harsh winter months when the frigid outside temperatures may kill an [[ectotherm]]ic reptile. They depress their metabolism and heart rates to reduce energy consumption so they don't need to exit their hibernacula.

They live in lakes during their active months, then travel to small offshoot streams to hibernate. Hibernacula are about 100\u2013150 meters away from the main body of the home lake. Most snapping turtles hibernate by burrowing into the banks of [[alder]] streams or vegetated streams, but some use other structures such as abandoned beaver dens. These streams are typically less than 0.3&nbsp;m deep and 0.7&nbsp;m wide, covered by sunken alder roots or fallen trees, and not covered by ice in the winter. Many animals return to the same stream to hibernate in subsequent years.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Snakes ===\n[[File:Snake Hole.jpg|thumb|An outside view of a snake burrow (species unknown)]]\nUnlike more solitary snapping turtles, snakes may either hibernate alone or in large aggregations of up to several thousand individuals of the same or different species. They use a wide variety of hibernacula, including: rock piles, debris-filled wells, caves, crevices, unused burrows made by other animals, and ant mounds. The [[Vipera berus|common European viper]] has actually been observed using all of the hibernacula listed above. Most species seem to prefer finding an already-present suitable site rather than constructing one of their own, but they do expand upon present structures and may make their own burrows if there aren't any quality sites available.<ref name=\":4\" /> [[Pituophis melanoleucus|Pine snakes]] and the closely related [[Louisiana pinesnake|Louisiana pine snakes]] are two of the most well-studied hibernating snake species, and share similar hibernacula characteristics.

Overwinter survival in these cricket frogs among other frogs is dependent on using hibernacula with appropriate physical microclimate characteristics, such as moist soil, that buffer frogs from temperatures that drop below the freezing point of the body fluids for extended periods.<ref name=\":62\" /> Although, determining if frogs can identify sites with appropriate microclimates to support overwinter survival and what factors might inform such choices are still unknown and will require further study. Therefore, it is still not known to what extent various types of prospective hibernacula for frogs might be suitable in the years to come, especially factoring in climate change.\n[[File:Alpine_Newt_(Ichthyosaura_alpestris)_hibernating_in_dead_wood_(13537518605).jpg|thumb|Alpine newt hibernating in dead wood]]\n\n===Newts===\nAs part the Highways Agency Biodiversity Action Plan (HABAP) in the UK, the Species Action Plan (SAP) for [[Northern crested newt|great crested newts]] aims to maintain and enhance existing newt populations through appropriate management of suitable habitat. As part of steps to implement the HABAP, newt hibernacula (e.g. log piles) have been constructed to improve the quality of the terrestrial habitat through increasing the number of potential overwintering sites.<ref name=\":72\">{{Cite journal|last=Knowles|first=Mark|last2=Latham|first2=Dorian|year=2008|title=Assessing the use of artificial hibernacula by great crested newts ''Triturus cristatus'' and other amphibians for habitat enhancement, Northumberland, England |url=http://www.conservationevidence.com/individual-study/2284|journal=Conservation Evidence |volume=5|pages=74\u201379|via=}}</ref> It was also determined that habitat surrounding breeding ponds with plenty of cover and suitable overwintering sites may have less need for provision of artificial hibernacula than landscapes with less woodland, hedgerows, scrub etc.<ref name=\":72\" /> Because great crested newts show high loyalty to over-wintering locations, returning to such established areas year after year, artificial hibernacula could be important in future years to conserve newts and other amphibians.<ref name=\":72\" /> Although, monitoring in the vicinity of these hibernacula in autumn using felt roofing tiles did not reveal the presence of any great crested newts even though they are known to breed in nearby ponds.<ref name=\":72\" /> Common toads and frogs did surround the area however. Therefore, further studies need to be conducted in order to create species-appropriate artificial hibernacula.\n\n== Reptiles ==\nMany reptiles undergo hibernation or a process called [[brumation]], which is similar to hibernation; both processes require usage of a hibernaculum. Staying inside an insulated hibernaculum is a strategy to avoid the harsh winter months when the frigid outside temperatures may kill an [[ectotherm]]ic reptile. They depress their metabolism and heart rates to reduce energy consumption so they don't need to exit their hibernacula. Hibernating reptiles are also safer from predation inside of their concealed and protected hibernacula. Various species of turtles, snakes, and lizards all use hibernacula, the forms of which can vary greatly.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Strain|first=Gabriel F. |last2=Anderson |first2=James T.|last3=Michael|first3=Edwin D.|last4=Turk|first4=Philip J.|date=January 1, 2012 |title=Hibernacula Use and Hibernation Phenology in the Common Snapping Turtle (''Chelydra serpentina'') in Canaan Valley, West Virginia |journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=46 |issue=2 |pages=269\u2013274 |doi=10.1670/10-275 |jstor=41515049}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite journal|last=Burger|first=Joanna|last2=Zappalorti|first2=Robert T. |last3=Gochfeld|first3=Michael|last4=Boarman|first4=William I. |last5=Caffrey |first5=Michael |last6=Doig |first6=Victor |last7=Garber |first7=Steven D.|last8=Lauro|first8=Brook|last9=Mikovsky|first9=Maria|date=January 1, 1988 |title=Hibernacula and Summer Den Sites of Pine Snakes (''Pituophis melanoleucus'') in the New Jersey Pine Barrens|journal=Journal of Herpetology |volume=22|issue=4|pages=425\u2013433|doi=10.2307/1564337|jstor=1564337}}</ref>\n[[File:Snapping turtle in Mud.JPG|thumb|An adult snapping turtle emerging from its stream-bank hibernaculum|223x223px]]\nHibernacula are typically:\n* Underground<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Below the frost line<ref name=\":4\" />\n* Well-insulated<ref name=\":8\" />\n* Tunnels (i.e. snakes)<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":9\" /> or cavities large enough for the body (i.e. lizards)<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Turtles ===\n[[Common snapping turtle]]s generally hibernate for about six months from early October to mid-April. They live in lakes during their active months, then travel to small offshoot streams to hibernate. Hibernacula are about 100\u2013150 meters away from the main body of the home lake. Most snapping turtles hibernate by burrowing into the banks of [[alder]] streams or vegetated streams, but some use other structures such as abandoned beaver dens. These streams are typically less than 0.3&nbsp;m deep and 0.7&nbsp;m wide, covered by sunken alder roots or fallen trees, and not covered by ice in the winter. Many animals return to the same stream to hibernate in subsequent years.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Snakes ===\n[[File:Snake Hole.jpg|thumb|An outside view of a snake burrow (species unknown)]]\nUnlike more solitary snapping turtles, snakes may either hibernate alone or in large aggregations of up to several thousand individuals of the same or different species. They use a wide variety of hibernacula, including: rock piles, debris-filled wells, caves, crevices, unused burrows made by other animals, and ant mounds. The [[Vipera berus|common European viper]] has actually been observed using all of the hibernacula listed above. Most species seem to prefer finding an already-present suitable site rather than constructing one of their own, but they do expand upon present structures and may make their own burrows if there aren't any quality sites available.<ref name=\":4\" /> [[Pituophis melanoleucus|Pine snakes]] and the closely related [[Louisiana pinesnake|Louisiana pine snakes]] are two of the most well-studied hibernating snake species, and share similar hibernacula characteristics. These species sometimes constructs their own burrows, or use tunnels formed from the decay of tree roots or by gophers. The tunnels form complex networks, and have side chambers which each house one snake.<ref name=\":4\" /><ref name=\":9\">{{Cite journal |last=D. C.|first=Rudolph|last2=R. R.|first2=Schaefer|last3=S.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood.

In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322\u20131325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 110\u2013112.</ref> Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 120.</ref> These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''\u2014\"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition\"\u2014and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 121.</ref> In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 124.</ref> Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.<ref>Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. \"Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'.

A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself.

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias.

Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting.

[\u2026] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhiliration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is ''really happening'', right now, to real people.\"</ref> As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.<ref name=SilverblattZlobin28>Silverblatt & Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 28\u201331. \"A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence\u2014regardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 percent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, ''Family Circle'' and ''McCall's''' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels.\"</ref>\n\n===Public sphere===\nThis collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or [[public sphere]].<ref name=Starr24 /><ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 677.</ref> In this view, the news media constitute a [[fourth estate]] which serves to check and balance the operations of government.<ref name=\"Allen47\"/>\n\nThis idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.<ref>Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 140\u2013144.</ref> According to one interpretation of the [[CNN effect]], instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 179\u2013185.</ref> In 1989, local and global communications media enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. The news about Tiananmen Square traveled over fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.<ref>Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 70\u201372.</ref>\n\n===News events===\nAs the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the [[collective memory]] of a society.<ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 211\u2013213.</ref><ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), pp. 685\u2013686. \"In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events\u2014at least as listener if not as spectator\u2014as they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics, so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world.\"</ref>\n\nOne type of news event, the [[media event]], is a scripted pageant organized for mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 1\u201314.</ref> These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 25\u201353.</ref> Usually they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), p. 196.</ref> Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence, can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Chris | last2 = Andresen | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Hoxha | first3 = Abit | title = \"The manufacture of an international news event: The day Kosovo was born\"; | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103\u2013120 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1177/1464884911400846}}</ref>\n\nThe perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 57\u201361.</ref> Crises can also increase the effect of news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to \"rally\" behind its current leadership.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 73\u201376.</ref> The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of [[terrorism]] and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the [[Iran hostage crisis|capture of American hostages in Iran]] dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a \"crisis\", and influenced a presidential election.<ref>Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 73\u201377.</ref>\n\nSouth Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.<ref>Danie Du Plessis, \"What's News in South Africa?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 303. \"Virtually all references to political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response.\"</ref> In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F. Kennedy]]), the 1969 [[moon landing]], the 1986 Challenger explosion, the 1997 death of Princess Diana, the [[Bush v. Gore|intervention of the Supreme Court]] in the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 presidential election]] and the 2001 [[September 11 attacks]].<ref>Elizabeth A. Skewes and Heather Black, \"What's News in the United States?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 329.</ref> In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of [[King Hussein]], Princess Diana, and [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin]]. Positive news stories found memorable by Jordanians featured political events affecting their lives and families\u2014such as the [[South Lebanon security belt|Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon]], and the [[Israel\u2013Jordan peace treaty]].<ref>Mohammed Issa Taha Ali, \"What's News in Jordan?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 252.</ref>\n\nNews coverage can also shape collective memory in retrospect. A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.<ref>Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, \"Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory\"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed.

When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\">{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A. Schuster, et al., \"A National Survey of Stress Reactions After the September 11, 2011, Terrorist Attacks\", ''New England Journal of Medicine'', 345.20, 15 November 2001.</ref> Studies have indicated that children have been traumatized by exposure to television of other frightening events, including the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|Challenger disaster]].<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Terr |display-authors=etal  | title = Children's symptoms in the wake of Challenger: a field study of distant-traumatic effects and an outline of related conditions | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 156 | issue = 10| year = 1999 | pmid = 10518163 | doi=10.1176/ajp.156.10.1536 | pages=1536\u201344}}</ref> Journalists themselves also experience trauma and guilt.<ref>Gavin Rees, \"The Trauma Factor\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\nResearch also suggest that constant representations of violence in the news lead people to overestimate the frequency of its occurrence in the real world, thus increasing their level of fear in everyday situations.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Altheide | first1 = David L. | title = The News Media, the Problem Frame, and the Production of Fear | url = | journal = Sociological Quarterly | volume = 38 | issue = 4| pages = 647\u2013668 | year= 1997 | doi = 10.1111/j.1533-8525.1997.tb00758.x }}</ref>\n\n===Influence===\nThe content and style of news delivery certainly have effects on the general public, with the magnitude and precise nature of these effects being tough to determine experimentally.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 1\u201310.</ref> In Western societies, television viewing has been so ubiquitous that its total effect on psychology and culture leave few alternatives for comparison.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 12. \"Some media may be so pervasive and so consistent in their effects that their impact is not noticeable. After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.</ref>\n\nNews is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}</ref> The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98\u201399.</ref> The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. \"When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness. So, agenda-setting appears to be stronger for less personally involving issues.\"</ref> The agenda-setting power becomes even stronger in practice because of the correspondence in news topics promulgated by different media channels.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Tien Vu | first1 = Hong | last2 = Guo | first2 = Lei | last3 = McCombs | first3 = Maxwell E. | title = Exploring 'the World Outside and the Pictures in Our Heads': A Network Agenda-Setting Study | url = | journal = Journalism and Mass Communication Quarterly | volume = 91 | issue = 4| year= 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Influence of sponsorship==\nIt has been acknowledged that [[sponsorship]] has historically influenced various news stories.<ref name=marketrevealed>https://www.marketingweek.com/brands-set-to-stay-classy-with-anchorman-2/</ref><ref name=theweekreports>https://theweek.com/articles/453933/how-nonstop-marketing-killed-buzz-anchorman-2</ref><ref name=startribunereports>http://www.startribune.com/don-shelby-an-anchorman-s-take-on-anchorman-2/236808001/</ref> This history gained widespread attention following the release of the film [[Anchorman 2]].<ref name=marketrevealed /><ref name=theweekreports /><ref name=startribunereports /> One example in recent time is  the fact that Facebook has invested heavily in news sources and purchasing time on local news media outlets.<ref name=facebookbust>https://techcrunch.com/2018/02/03/facebooks-siren-call/</ref><ref name=nbcreports /> Tech Crunch journalist Josh Constine even stated in February 2018 that the company \"stole the news business\" and used sponsorship to make many news publishers its \"ghostwriters.\"<ref name=facebookbust /> In January 2019, founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he will spend $300 million in local news buys over a three year period.<ref name=nbcreports>https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/facebook-announces-300-million-investment-local-news-n958726</ref><ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/facebook-investing-300-million-to-bolster-local-news/</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Toronto School of communication theory]] [http://wikiglobals.com wikiglobals]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources and further reading==\n* Allan, Stuart, ''News Culture''.

This may be provided through many different [[Media (communication)|media]]: [[word of mouth]], [[printing]], [[postal system]]s, [[broadcasting]], [[electronic communication]], or through the [[testimony]] of observers and [[witness]]es to events.\n\nCommon topics for news reports include war, government, politics, education, health, the environment, economy, business, fashion, and entertainment, as well as athletic events, quirky or unusual events. [[Government]] proclamations, concerning royal ceremonies, laws, taxes, public health, and criminals, have been dubbed news since ancient times. Humans exhibit a nearly universal desire to learn and share news, which they satisfy by talking to each other and sharing information. Technological and social developments, often driven by government communication and espionage networks, have increased the speed with which news can spread, as well as influenced its content. The genre of news as we know it today is closely associated with the [[newspaper]], which originated in China as a court bulletin and spread, with [[paper]] and [[printing press]], to Europe.\n\n==Meaning==\n===Etymology===\nThe [[English language|English]] word \"news\" developed in the 14th century as a special use of the plural form of \"new\". In [[Middle English]], the equivalent word was ''newes'', like the French ''[[wikt:nouvelles|nouvelles]]'' and the German ''Neues''. Similar developments are found in the [[Slavic languages]] the [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''[[wikt:noviny|noviny]]'' (from ''[[wikt:nov\u00fd|nov\u00fd]]'', \"new\"), the [[cognate]] [[Polish language|Polish]] ''nowiny'', the [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] ''novini'', and [[Russian language|Russian]] ''novosti'' \u2013 and in the [[Celtic languages]]: the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''newyddion'' (from ''newydd'') and the [[Cornish language|Cornish]] ''nowodhow'' (from ''nowydh'').<ref name=OED>\"News\", ''Oxford English Dictionary'', accessed online, 5 March 2015. \"Etymology: Spec. use of plural of new n., after Middle French ''nouvelles'' (see novel n.), or classical Latin ''nova'' new things, in post-classical Latin also news (from late 13th cent. in British sources), use as noun of neuter plural of ''novus'' new (compare classical Latin ''r\u0113s nova'' (feminine singular) a new development, a fresh turn of events).

Today that race is being won by television and radio. Consequently, daily newspapers are beginning to underplay breaking news about yesterday's events (already old news to much of their audience) in favor of more analytical perspectives on those events. In other words, dailies are now moving in the direction toward which weeklies retreated when dailies were introduced.\"</ref>\n\n===Commodity===\nAccording to some theories, \"news\" is whatever the news industry sells.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 35, 82. \"... newspapers were defining what news was, categorizing and expanding their domain on the fly. Indeed, Somerville argues that 'news' is not an objective 'historical' concept but one that is defined by the news industry as it creates a commodity sold by publishers to the public.\"</ref> Journalism, broadly understood along the same lines, is the act or occupation of collecting and providing news.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 3. \"The term ''journalism'' is used broadly here and elsewhere in the book to refer to more than just the production of printed 'journals'; it is the most succinct term we have for the activity of gathering and disseminating news.\"</ref><ref>Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 7. \"[...] for the journalist the assessment of newsworthiness is an operationalization based on the aforementioned conditions. In other words, the practitioner typically constructs a method for fulfilling the daily job requirements. He or she rarely has an underlying theoretical understanding of what defining something or someone as ''newsworthy'' entails. To be sure, individual journalists may engage in more abstract musings about their work, but the profession as a whole is content to apply these conditions and does not care that the theory behind the application is not widely understood. Hall (1981, 147) calls news a 'slippery' concept, with journalists defining newsworthiness as those things that get into the news media.\"</ref> From a commercial perspective, news is simply one input, along with paper (or an electronic server) necessary to prepare a final product for distribution.<ref>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), p. 6. \"News fitted ideally into the expanding market for cheap print, and it swiftly became an important commodity.\"</ref> A news agency supplies this resource \"wholesale\" and publishers enhance it for retail.<ref name=Globalization6>Boyd-Barrett & Rantanen, ''The Globalization of News'' (1998), p. 6. \"News agency news is considered 'wholesale' resource material, something that has to be worked upon, smelted, reconfigured, for conversion into a news report that is suitable for consumption by ordinary readers. It has also suited the news agencies to be thus presented: they have needed to seem credible to extensive networks of 'retail' clients of many different political and cultural shades and hues. They have wanted to avoid controversy, to maintain an image of plain, almost dull, but completely dependable professionalism.\"</ref><ref name=MacGregor>Phil MacGregor, \"International News Agencies: Global eyes that never blink\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref>\n\n===Tone===\nMost purveyors of news value impartiality, neutrality, and [[Journalistic objectivity|objectivity]], despite the inherent difficulty of reporting without political bias.<ref>Heyd, ''Reading newspapers'' (2012), pp. 36\u201337.</ref> Perception of these values has changed greatly over time as sensationalized '[[tabloid journalism]]' has risen in popularity. [[Michael Schudson]] has argued that before the era of World War I and the concomitant rise of [[propaganda]], journalists were not aware of the concept of [[media bias|bias in reporting]], let alone actively correcting for it.<ref>Schudson, ''Discovering the News'' (1978), p. 6. \"Before the 1920s, journalists did not think much about the subjectivity of perception. They had relatively little incentive to doubt the firmness of the reality by which they lived. [\u2026] After World War I, however, this changed. Journalists, like others, lost faith in the democratic market society had taken for granted. Their experience of propaganda during the war and public relations thereafter convinced them that the world they reported was one that interested parties had constructed for them to report. In such a world, na\u00efve empiricism could not last.\"</ref> News is also sometimes said to portray the [[truth]], but this relationship is elusive and qualified.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 46\u201347.</ref>\n\nParadoxically, another property commonly attributed to news is [[sensationalism]], the disproportionate focus on, and exaggeration of, emotive stories for public consumption.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 2. \"Sensationalism appears to be a technique or style that is rooted somehow in the nature of the news.

Among Zulus, Mongolians, Polynesians, and American Southerners, anthropologists have documented the practice of questioning travelers for news as a matter of priority.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), pp. 14, 305. \"The desire to pass on tales of current events could be found even in cultures that did not have writing\u2014let alone printing presses or computers\u2014to whet or satisfy their thirst for news. Observers have often remarked on the fierce concern with the news that they find in preliterate or semiliterate peoples.

Starting in England, [[coffeehouses]] served as important sites for the spread of news, even after telecommunications became widely available. The history of the coffee houses is traced from Arab countries, which was introduced in England in the 16th century.<ref>Stephens, ''History of News'' (1988), p. 8. \"A particularly lively forum for the exchange of news by word of mouth\u2014the coffeehouse\u2014flourished in England well after the development of the newspaper, and in some countries, the coffeehouse has survived even the introduction of television.\"</ref> In the Muslim world, people have gathered and exchanged news at [[mosque]]s and other social places.

In thirteenth-century Florence, criers known as ''banditori'' arrived in the market regularly, to announce political news, to convoke public meetings, and to call the populace to arms. In 1307 and 1322\u20131325, laws were established governing their appointment, conduct, and salary. These laws stipulated how many times a banditoro was to repeat a proclamation (forty) and where in the city they were to read them.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 110\u2013112.</ref> Different declarations sometimes came with additional protocols; announcements regarding the plague were also to be read at the city gates.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 120.</ref> These proclamations all used a standard format, beginning with an ''[[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]]''\u2014\"The worshipful and most esteemed gentlemen of the Eight of Ward and Security of the city of Florence make it known, notify, and expressly command, to whosoever, of whatever status, rank, quality and condition\"\u2014and continuing with a statement (''narratio''), a request made upon the listeners (''petitio''), and the penalty to be exacted from those who would not comply (''peroratio'').<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 121.</ref> In addition to major declarations, ''bandi'' (announcements) might concern petty crimes, requests for information, and notices about missing slaves.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), pp. 122\u2013123.</ref> [[Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli]] was captured by the Medicis in 1513, following a bando calling for his immediate surrender.<ref>Milner, \"Fanno bandire\" (2013), p. 124.</ref> Some town criers could be paid to include advertising along with news.<ref>Straubhaar and LaRose, ''Communications Media in the Information Society'' (1997), p. 366. \"Another ancient form of advertising was the town crier, who told the citizenry about the 'good deal' to be found 'just around the corner'. Unlike the signs, which contained only information regarding the merchant, the criers also informed the citizens of the news of the day. Because the crier, or his agent, was compensated for his assistance in getting the advertising message out in the context of the news, there are interesting parallels with the newspaper of today (Applegate, 1993; Roche, 1993; Schramm, 1988).\"</ref>\n\nUnder the [[Ottoman Empire]], official messages were regularly distributed at mosques, by traveling holy men, and by secular criers.

Thus, political, religious, and commercial interests have historically controlled, expanded, and monitored communications channels by which news could spread.

Messengers were controlled, for the most part, by kings, chiefs, headmen. They were rarely channels of dissent.\"</ref>\n\nOne of the imperial communication channels, called the \"[[Royal Road]]\" traversed the [[Assyrian Empire]] and served as a key source of its power.<ref>Kessler, \"Royal Roads\" (1995), p. 129. \"The ability of the Assyrian court to challenge a huge and permanent stream of information seems to have been one of the essential factors for the long maintenance of Assyrian domination, over the vast areas in the Near East.\"</ref> The Roman Empire maintained a vast network of roads, known as ''[[cursus publicus]]'', for similar purposes.<ref>Pettegree, ''The Invention of News'' (2014), pp. 19\u201320.</ref>\n\nVisible chains of long distance signaling, known as [[optical telegraph]]y, have also been used throughout history to convey limited types of information.

News can be delivered more quickly through this method of news as well as accessed more easily. The internet era has transformed the understanding of news. Because the internet allows communication which is not only instantaneous, but also bi- or multi-directional, it has blurred the boundaries of who is a legitimate news producer. A common type of internet journalism is called [[blogging]], which is a service of persistently written articles uploaded and written by one or more individuals.

It requires no more than a reporter and a laptop. In that way, journalistic authority seems to have become more individual- and less institution-based. But does the individual reporter always have to be an actual journalist? Or can journalistic work be done from anywhere and by anyone? These are questions that refer to the core of journalistic practice and the definition of \"news\" itself. As Schudson has given emphasis to, the answer is not easily found; \"the ground journalists walk upon is shaking, and the experience for both those who work in the field and those on the outside studying it is dizzying\".<ref name=\"Schudson 2011 205\"/>\n\nSchudson has identified the following six specific areas where the ecology of news in his opinion has changed:\n* The line between the reader and writer has blurred.\n* The distinction among tweet, blog post, Facebook, newspaper story, magazine article, and book has blurred.\n* The line between professionals and amateurs has blurred, and a variety of \"pro-am\" relationships has emerged.\n* The boundaries delineating for-profit, public, and non-profit media have blurred, and the cooperation across these models of financing has developed.\n* Within commercial news organizations, the line between the news room and the business office has blurred.\n* The line between old media and new media has blurred, practically beyond recognition.<ref>{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|pages=207\u2013216}}</ref>\n\nThese alterations inevitably have fundamental ramifications for the contemporary ecology of news. \"The boundaries of journalism, which just a few years ago seemed relatively clear, and permanent, have become less distinct, and this blurring, while potentially the foundation of progress even as it is the source of risk, has given rise to a new set of journalistic principles and practices\",<ref>{{cite book|last=Schudson|first=Michael|title=The Sociology of News (2nd edition)|year=2011|page=207}}</ref> Schudson puts it.

At this point, the [[World Bank]] took an active role in the governance of many countries, and its authority extended to communications policy. The policy of developing Third World media gave way to a global regime of [[free trade]] institutions like the [[World Trade Organization]], which also protected the free flow of information across borders.<ref>Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 33\u201338.</ref> The World Bank also promoted privatization of national telecommunications, which afforded large multinational corporations the opportunity to purchase networks and expand operations in the Third World.<ref>Chakravartty and Sarikakis, ''Media Policy and Globalization'' (2006), pp. 58\u201372, 133\u2013136. \"In almost all cases, a combination of privatization schemes and higher rates of public investment led to double-digit growth in teledensity figures throughout the 1990s and continuing today (see Table 3.3).

Commonly, news content should contain all the \"[[Five Ws]]\" (who, what, when, where, why, and also how) of an event. Newspapers normally place hard news stories on the first pages, so the most important information is at the beginning, enabling busy readers to read as little or as much as they desire. Local stations and networks with a set format must take news stories and break them down into the most important aspects due to time constraints.\n\nJournalists are often expected to aim for [[objectivity (journalism)|objectivity]]; reporters claim to try to cover all sides of an issue without bias, as compared to commentators or analysts, who provide [[opinion]] or personal points of view. The resulting articles lay out facts in a sterile, noncommittal manner, standing back to \"let the reader decide\" the truth of the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/~pmeyer/ire95pj.htm |title=Public Journalism and the Problem of Objectivity |publisher=Unc.edu |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Several governments impose certain constraints against bias. In the [[United Kingdom]], the government agency of [[Ofcom]] (Office of Communications) enforces a legal requirement of \"impartiality\" on news broadcasters.<ref name=Wallace>Sue Wallace, \"Impartiality in the News\", in Fowler-Watt & Allan (eds.), ''Journalism'' (2013).</ref> Both newspapers and broadcast news programs in the United States are generally expected to remain neutral and avoid bias except for clearly indicated editorial articles or segments. Many single-party governments have operated state-run news organizations, which may present the government's views.\n\nAlthough newswriters have always laid claim to truth and objectivity, the modern values of professional journalism were established beginning in the late 1800s and especially after World War I, when groups like the [[American Society of Newspaper Editors]] codified rules for unbiased news reporting. These norms held the most sway in American and British journalism, and were scorned by some other countries.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 20\u201323.</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Matheson | first1 = Donald | title = \"The birth of news discourse: changes in news language in British newspapers, 1880\u20131930\"; | url = | journal = Media, Culture & Society | volume = 22 | issue = 5| pages = 557\u2013573 | year= 2000 | doi = 10.1177/016344300022005002 }}</ref> These ideas have become part of the practice of journalism across the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 15, 35.</ref> Soviet commentators said stories in the Western press were trivial distractions from reality, and emphasized a [[socialist realism]] model focusing on developments in everyday life.<ref>Wolfe, ''Governing Soviet Journalism'' (2005), p. 29.</ref>\n\nEven in those situations where objectivity is expected, it is difficult to achieve, and individual journalists may fall foul of their own personal bias, or succumb to [[Media bias|commercial or political pressure]]. Similarly, the objectivity of news organizations owned by conglomerated corporations fairly may be questioned, in light of the natural incentive for such groups to report news in a manner intended to advance the conglomerate's financial interests. Individuals and organizations who are the subject of news reports may use [[news management]] techniques to try to make a favourable impression.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomas|first=Helen|title=Watchdogs of Democracy?: The Waning Washington Press Corps and How It Has Failed the Public|chapter=Spinning the News|year=2006|page=57|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/?id=lixOlrqPeqoC|isbn=978-1-4165-4861-4|publisher=Simon and Schuster}}</ref> Because each individual has a particular point of view, it is recognized that there can be no absolute objectivity in news reporting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cjr.org/feature/rethinking_objectivity.php?page=all |title=Re-thinking Objectivity |publisher=CJR |accessdate=9 March 2012}}</ref> Journalists can collectively shift their opinion over what is a controversy up for debate and what is an established fact, as evidenced by homogenization during the 2000s of news coverage of climate change.<ref>Sara Shipley Hiles & Amanda Hinnart, \"Climate Change in the Newsroom: Journalists' Evolving Standards of Objectivity When Covering Global Warming\"; ''Science Communication 36.4, 2014.</ref>\n\nSome commentators on news values have argued that journalists' training in news values ''itself'' represents a systemic bias of the news. The norm of objectivity leads journalists to gravitate towards certain types of acts and exclude others. A journalist can be sure of objectivity in reporting that an official or public figure has made a certain statement. This is one reason why so much news reporting is devoted to official statements.<ref>John Soloski, \"News Reporting and Professionalism: Some Constraints on Reporting the News\", from ''Media, Culture & Society'' 11 (1989); reprinted in Berkowitz, ''Social Meanings of News'' (1997), pp. 143\u2013145.</ref> This lemma dates back to the early history of public news reporting, as exemplified by an English printer who on 12 March 1624 published news from Brussels in the form of letters, with the prefacing comment: \"Now because you shall not say, that either out of my owne conceit I misliked a phrase, or presumptuously tooke upon me to reforme any thing amisse, I will truly set you downe their owne words.\"<ref>Cranfield, ''Press and Society'' (1978), p. 8.</ref>\n\n[[Strong objectivity|Feminist critiques]] argue that discourse defined as objective by news organizations reflects a male-centered perspective.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 123.</ref> In their selection of sources, journalists rely heavily on men as sources of authoritative- and objective-seeming statements.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), p. 129.</ref> News reporting has also tended to discuss women differently, usually in terms of appearance and relationship to men.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 134\u2013135.</ref>\n\nThe critique of traditional norms of objectivity comes from within news organizations as well. Said Peter Horrocks, head of television news at BBC: \"The days of middle-of-the-road, balancing Left and Right, impartiality are dead.

News stories use familiar formats and subgenres which vary by topic. \"Rituals of objectivity\", such as pairing a quotation from one group with a quotation from a competing group, dictate the construction of most news narratives. Many news items revolve around periodic press conferences or other scheduled events. Further routine is established by assigning each journalist to a [[Beat reporting|beat]]: a domain of human affairs, usually involving government or commerce, in which certain types of events routinely occur.<ref>James S. Ettema, D. Charles Whitney, & Daniel B. Wackman, in ''Handbook of Communications Science'' (1987), ed. C.H. Berger & S.H.

They come to perceive news as characteristic of adulthood, and begin watching television news in their teenage years because of the adult status it confers.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 113\u2013115.</ref>\n\nPeople exhibit various forms of skepticism towards the news. Studies of [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] readers found that many of them gain pleasure from seeing through the obviously fake or poorly constructed stories\u2014and get their \"real news\" from television.<ref>Allan, ''News Culture'' (2004), pp. 110\u2013112.</ref>\n\n===Social and cultural cohesion===\nAn important feature distinguishing news from private information transfers is the impression that when one reads (or hears, or watches) it, one joins a larger public.<ref name=Starr24>Starr, ''Creation of the Media'' (2004), p. 24. \"Publications weave invisible threads of connection among their readers. Once a newspaper circulates, for example, no one ever truly reads it alone. Readers know that others are also seeing it at roughly the same time, and they read it differently as a result, conscious that the information is now out in the open, spread before a public that may talk about the news and act on it.\"</ref> In this regard news serves to unify its receivers under the banner of a culture, or a society, as well as into the sub-demographics of a society targeted by their favorite kind of news.<ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), p. 17. \"The newspaper has ceased to be a personal organ and has become a social product; it no longer represents the interests of an individual, but it represents rather a group activity. The press groups society and unifies each group, as Scott-James has pointed out. It unifies society on national lines and thus the press of each country has developed in its own characteristic direction. It unifies the groups interested in religion, in politics, in business, in automobiles, in sports, in education, or in fashion, and from these groups having unified interests there has developed the press that ministers to each specialized group.\"</ref> News thus plays a role in [[nation-building]], the construction of a national identity.<ref>Motti Neiger, Eyal Zandberg, and Oren Meyers, \"Localizing Collective Memory: Radio Broadcasts and the Construction of Regional Memory\"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed. Neiger, Myers, & Zandberg; pp. 156\u2013160. \"In Israel, radio played a decisive role in establishing and consolidating the nation during the first decades after the creation of the State (Pansler, 2004). The exclusive position enjoyed by radio in the field of electronic broadcasting during the crucial first twenty years of Israel's existence since 1948, when the press was politically divided and television was absent\u2014Israel's first television channel started broadcasting in 1968\u2014gave it much weight in setting the collective agenda.\"</ref>\n\n[[Photojournalism|Images connected with news]] can also become iconic and gain a fixed role in the culture. Examples such as [[Alfred Eisenstaedt]]'s photograph ''[[V-J Day in Times Square]]'', [[Nick Ut]]'s photograph of [[Phan Thi Kim Phuc]] and other children running from a napalm blast in Vietnam; [[Kevin Carter]]'s photograph of a starving child being stalked by a vulture;<ref name=Zeiler31 /> etc.\n\nWith the new interconnectedness of global media, the experience of receiving news along with a world audience reinforces the social cohesion effect on a larger scale.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 6\u20137. \"But [news] is an illusion which, when we receive it, and when we extend to it our trust in its authority as a representation of the real, transports us from the relative isolation of our domestic environments, the parochialism of our streets and small towns, the crowded bustle of our big cities, to membership of virtual global communities, united in access to ''these'' events, communally experienced at ''this'' moment, through global communications networks. [\u2026] It is, indeed, more like the fear and exhiliration experienced by watching a movie on the big screen, but with an added viscerality contributed by the awareness that this scene, unlike a movie, is ''really happening'', right now, to real people.\"</ref> As a corollary, global media culture may erode the uniqueness and cohesion of national cultures.<ref name=SilverblattZlobin28>Silverblatt & Zlobin, ''International Communications'' (2004), pp. 28\u201331. \"A major liability of transnational media conglomerates is the loss of distinctive local culture. Transnational media conglomerates have a distinctly American influence\u2014regardless of their country of origin. For instance, although Bertlesmann is a German-based corporation, in 2001, its largest proportion of its revenue (35 percent) came from its U.S. media subsidiaries, including Bantam, Doubleday Dell, and Random House publishing companies, ''Family Circle'' and ''McCall's''' magazines, and Arista and RCA record labels.\"</ref>\n\n===Public sphere===\nThis collective form experience can be understood to constitute a political realm or [[public sphere]].<ref name=Starr24 /><ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), p. 677.</ref> In this view, the news media constitute a [[fourth estate]] which serves to check and balance the operations of government.<ref name=\"Allen47\"/>\n\nThis idea, at least as a goal to be sought, has re-emerged in the era of global communications.<ref>Geniets, ''Global News Challenge'' (2013), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> Today, unprecedented opportunities exist for public analysis and discussion of world events.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 140\u2013144.</ref> According to one interpretation of the [[CNN effect]], instantaneous global news coverage can rally public opinion as never before to motivate political action.<ref>McNair, ''Cultural Chaos'' (2006), pp. 179\u2013185.</ref> In 1989, local and global communications media enabled instant exposure to and discussion of the Chinese government's actions in [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square]]. The news about Tiananmen Square traveled over fax machine, telephone, newspaper, radio, and television, and continued to travel even after the government imposed new restrictions on local telecommunications.<ref>Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 70\u201372.</ref>\n\n===News events===\nAs the technological means for disseminating news grew more powerful, news became an experience which millions of people could undergo simultaneously. Outstanding news experiences can exert profound influence on millions of people. Through its power to effect a shared experience, news events can mold the [[collective memory]] of a society.<ref>Salmon, ''The Newspaper and the Historian'' (1923), pp. 211\u2013213.</ref><ref>Park, \"News as a Form of Knowledge\" (1940), pp. 685\u2013686. \"In fact, the multiplication of the means of communication has brought it about that anyone, even in the most distant part of the world, may now actually participate in events\u2014at least as listener if not as spectator\u2014as they actually take place in some other part of the world. We have recently listened to Mussolini address his fascist followers from a balcony of Rome; we have heard Hitler speaking over the heads of a devout congregation in the Reichstag, in Berlin, not merely to the President, but to the people, of the United States. We have even had an opportunity to hear the terms of the momentous Munich agreement ten seconds after it had been signed by the representatives of four of the leading powers in Europe and the world. The fact that acts so momentous as these can be so quickly and so publicly consummated has suddenly and completely changed the character of international politics, so that one can no longer even guess what the future has in store for Europe and for the world.\"</ref>\n\nOne type of news event, the [[media event]], is a scripted pageant organized for mass live broadcast. Media events include athletic contests such as the Super Bowl and the Olympics, cultural events like awards ceremonies and celebrity funerals, and also political events such as coronations, debates between electoral candidates, and diplomatic ceremonies.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 1\u201314.</ref> These events typically unfold according to a common format which simplifies the transmission of news items about them.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), pp. 25\u201353.</ref> Usually they have the effect of increasing the perceived unity of all parties involved, which include the broadcasters and audience.<ref>Dayan & Katz, ''Media Events'' (1992), p. 196.</ref> Today, international events such as a national declaration of independence, can be scripted in advance with the major news agencies, with staff specially deployed to key locations worldwide in advance of the life news broadcast. Public relations companies can participate in these events as well.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Paterson | first1 = Chris | last2 = Andresen | first2 = Kenneth | last3 = Hoxha | first3 = Abit | title = \"The manufacture of an international news event: The day Kosovo was born\"; | url = | journal = Journalism | volume = 13 | issue = 1| pages = 103\u2013120 | year= 2011 | doi=10.1177/1464884911400846}}</ref>\n\nThe perception that an ongoing crisis is taking place further increases the significance of live news. People rely on the news and constantly seek more of it, to learn new information and to seek reassurance amidst feelings of fear and uncertainty.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 57\u201361.</ref> Crises can also increase the effect of news on social cohesion, and lead the population of a country to \"rally\" behind its current leadership.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 73\u201376.</ref> The rise of a global news system goes hand in hand with the advent of [[terrorism]] and other sensational acts, which have power in proportion to the audience they capture. In 1979, the [[Iran hostage crisis|capture of American hostages in Iran]] dominated months of news coverage in the western media, gained the status of a \"crisis\", and influenced a presidential election.<ref>Hachten, ''World News Prism'' (1996), pp. 73\u201377.</ref>\n\nSouth Africans overwhelmingly describe the end of Apartheid as a source of the country's most important news.<ref>Danie Du Plessis, \"What's News in South Africa?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 303. \"Virtually all references to political significance of news events refer to the historical events of the first part of the 1990s. Current political events are overshadowed so greatly by the start of the political process in South Africa that they have lost much of their significance to the participants. Both black and white participants in the focus group shared this response.\"</ref> In the United States, news events such as the assassinations of the 1960s (of [[assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy]], [[Assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Robert F.

Skewes and Heather Black, \"What's News in the United States?\" in Shoemaker & Cohen, ''News Around the World'' (2006), p. 329.</ref> In Jordan, people cited numerous memorable news events involving death and war, including the death of [[King Hussein]], Princess Diana, and [[Assassination of Yitzhak Rabin|Yitzhak Rabin]].

A study of Israeli news coverage leading up to the media event of the nation's 60th birthday found that news coverage of events like the Holocaust, World War Two, and subsequent Israeli wars increased the perceived importance of these events in the minds of citizens.<ref>Neta Kliger-Vilenchik, \"Memory-Setting: Applying Agenda-Setting Theory to the Study of Collective Memory\"; in ''On Media Memory'' (2011), ed.

When discussing the act of news making, scholars refer to specific models. Five of these models are the Professional Model, Mirror Model, Organizational Model, Political Model, and Civic Journalism Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\">{{Cite book|title = Mass Media and American Politics|last = Graber|first = Doris A.|publisher = Congressional Quarterly Press|year = 1980|isbn = |location = |pages = }}</ref>\n\nThe Professional Model is when skilled peoples put certain events together for a specific audience. The reaction of the audience is influential because it can determine the impact that the particular article or newspaper has on the readers.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\">{{Cite web|url = http://post.queensu.ca/~rosej/pols313|title = Queen's University \u2013 Department of Political Studies|date = |accessdate = |website = Queen's University|publisher = }}</ref> The Mirror Model states that news should reflect reality. This model aims to focus on particular events and provide accuracy in reporting. The Organizational Model is also known as the Bargaining Model.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> It focuses on influencing various news organizations by applying pressures to governmental processes. The Political Model outlines that news represents the ideological biases of the people as well as the various pressures of the political environment. This model mainly influences journalists and attempts to promote public opinion.<ref name=\"post.queensu.ca\"/> The Civic Journalism Model is when the press discovers the concerns of the people and uses that to write stories. This allows the audience to play an active role in society.\n\nModels of news making help define what the news is and how it influences readers. But it does not necessarily account for the content of print news and online media. Stories are selected if they have a strong impact, incorporate violence and scandal, are familiar and local, and if they are timely.\n\nNews Stories with a strong impact can be easily understood by a reader. Violence and scandal create an entertaining and attention-grabbing story.<ref name=\"Graber 1980\"/> Familiarity makes a story more relatable because the reader knows who is being talked about. Proximity can influence a reader more. A story that is timely will receive more coverage because it is a current event. The process of selecting stories coupled with the models of news making are how the media is effective and impactful in society.\n\n===Psychological effects===\n{{see also|Media influence|Cultivation theory}}\n\nExposure to constant news coverage of war can lead to stress and anxiety.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' 2001; 55.</ref> Television coverage of the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|destruction of the World Trade Center]] in 2001, which repeated the same footage [[psychic driving|over and over]], led to symptoms of [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]] experienced across the United States.<ref>Mark A.

After all, it is almost impossible find someone who doesn't watch television in industrialized societies. And those light viewers associate regularly with others who do watch television. Morgan (1986) suggested that 'the longer we live with television, the smaller television's observable impact may become'.</ref>\n\nNews is the leading source of knowledge about global affairs for people around the world.<ref>Zhong, \"Searching for Meaning\" (2006), pp. 17\u201318.</ref> According to [[agenda-setting theory]], the general public will identify as its priorities those issues which are highlighted on the news.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = McCombs | first1 = Maxwell E. | last2 = Shaw | first2 = Donald L. | title = The Agenda-Setting Function of Mass Media | doi = 10.1086/267990 | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 36 | issue = 2| page = 176 | year = 1972 }}</ref> The agenda-setting model has been well-supported by research, which indicate that the public's self-reported concerns respond to changes in news coverage rather than changes in the underlying issue itself.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 98\u201399.</ref> The less an issue obviously affects people's lives, the bigger an influence media agenda-setting can have on their opinion of it.<ref>Perse, ''Media Effects And Society'' (2001), 100. \"When issues are obtrusive, or directly experienced, such as inflation, the public does not need the news media to alert them to its importance. But, the less direct experience that they have with an issue, the more they depend on the news media for awareness.

He currently competes part-time in the [[Stadium Super Trucks]] in the [[Continental Tire]] truck, and part time in the [[24 Hours of LeMans]]. After racing in the NASCAR [[Winter Heat Series]] in the mid-1990s, he was recommended to [[Jack Roush]] by former announcer [[Benny Parsons]]. With [[Roush Racing]], he was the [[1998 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]] [[1998 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series#Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]].  He won the [[2000 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2000 Craftsman Truck championship]]. He reprised this progression in the [[NASCAR Busch Series]], winning the [[2001 NASCAR Busch Series|2001 Rookie of the Year]], immediately followed by winning the [[2002 NASCAR Busch Series|2002 championship]]. Biffle drove in the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] for Roush from [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2003]] until [[2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2016]], winning 19 races in the No. 16 Ford. He currently is also an analyst for [[NBC Sports]]' show ''[[NASCAR America]]''.\n\nBiffle, who began his NASCAR career in 1995, is the first of only three drivers that have [[List of NASCAR drivers who have won in each of top three series#Driver championships in two of the top divisions|won a championship in both]] the [[NASCAR Busch Series|Busch Series]] and the [[NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]], and the sixth of only twenty-nine drivers to [[List of NASCAR drivers who have won in each of top three series#Triple Threat|win a race in each of NASCAR's three national series]]. Biffle returned to NASCAR in 2019 when he ran the [[2019 SpeedyCash.com 400]] for [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]], where he won.\n\n==Racing career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\nBiffle was born and raised in [[Camas, Washington]].<ref>http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/drivers/dps/gbiffle00  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214072900/http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/drivers/dps/gbiffle00|date=February 14, 2010}}</ref> He began his racing career driving on [[Short track motor racing|short tracks]] around the [[Pacific Northwest]]. He first gained attention as a driver when he raced in the nationally televised [[Winter Heat Series]] in the winter of 1995\u20131996. Biffle dominated the series championship that winter, leading former ESPN announcer and NASCAR champion, [[Benny Parsons]], to recommend the driver to [[Jack Roush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roushracing.com/Greg_Biffle/default.asp?page=/greg_biffle/gbbio.htm&menu=greg|title=Greg Biffle|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223933/http://www.roushracing.com/Greg_Biffle/default.asp?page=%2Fgreg_biffle%2Fgbbio.htm&menu=greg|archivedate=September 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBiffle entered the first two races of the 1996 [[NASCAR Camping World West Series|Winston West Series]], finishing 30th at [[Tucson Raceway Park|Tucson]] and 4th at [[Altamont Raceway Park|Altamont]]. His debut in one of NASCAR's national divisions came later that year when he ran the final two [[Nationwide Series|Busch Series]] races of the season. Driving a [[Chevrolet]] for Dick Bown, he finished 23rd at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]] but lost an engine the following race at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead]] and finished 36th. In 1997, Biffle competed in the now-defunct [[NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Northwest Series|NASCAR Northwest Series]] and won the Most Popular Driver Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racingone.com/driver.aspx?driverid=214&seriesID=1&subID=1|title=Greg Biffle Profile|publisher=Racingone.com|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103113105/http://racingone.com/driver.aspx?driverID=214&seriesID=1&subid=1|archive-date=January 3, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Gander Outdoors Truck Series===\nRoush Racing promoted Biffle to a full-time driver in the [[Camping World Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]] in 1998. Despite not winning a race that season, Biffle's four pole positions are the most by a Truck Series rookie to date and they helped him earn an 8th-place finish in the final standings and the [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] Award. He followed it up with a stellar 1999 season in which he recorded nine wins, a single-season Truck Series record that still stands {{as of |2018 |lc=y}}. He finished second in the final standings, just eight points behind champion [[Jack Sprague]].\n\nIn 2000, Biffle won the Truck Series title with another five-win season, beating his Roush teammate [[Kurt Busch]] by 230 points. It was Biffle's first championship in one of NASCAR's three major series. It was announced that Biffle would move up to the Busch Series for 2001, however, he ran four more Truck races for Roush that season and won at Phoenix. Biffle made a Truck Series start in 2004 for another long-time Ford team, [[Circle Bar Racing]], at Homestead.\n\n[[File:Biffle at Texas 2019.jpg|thumb|Biffle ahead of [[Matt Crafton]] at [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]] in 2019.]]\nOn March 28, 2019, Biffle announced he would be testing with [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]] the next day at [[Texas Motor Speedway]] in the No. 51 truck.

The following season, he won another four races and earned 20 top-five finishes out of 34 races en route to his first Busch Series title and the second NASCAR national championship of his career.\n\nHe ran only part-time in 2003 as Roush moved him up to a full-time ride in the [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] for that season, but he returned to contend for the Busch Series championship again in 2004. He placed third in the standings behind [[Martin Truex Jr.]] and [[Kyle Busch]]. From 2005 to 2009, Biffle raced part-time for Roush Fenway Racing in the Busch (now Xfinity Series) every year. He won twice in 2009, at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]] and [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]], after going winless the previous two seasons. Biffle returned to the Nationwide Series in 2010, driving the No. 27 Ford for [[Baker Curb Racing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/bg/01/09/gbiffle.baker.curb/index.html|title=Biffle back at Baker Curb, will drive No. 27 Ford|publisher=NASCAR.com |date=January 9, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112121835/http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/bg/01/09/gbiffle.baker.curb/index.html|archivedate=January 12, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Sprint Cup Series===\n[[File:Greg Biffle 2008 3M Ford Fusion.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Cup racecar]]\nBiffle began his Cup Series career in the 2002 season. He attempted to qualify in a Roush Ford for the [[2002 Daytona 500]] but failed to make the race. He would make his first Cup debut nine races later at [[Auto Club Speedway|California]], a race in which he finished 13th. That was his best finish in seven races that year as he also drove four in a Chevrolet for [[Andy Petree Racing]] and two in a Dodge for [[Petty Enterprises]].\n\nBiffle began competing full-time in NASCAR's top division in 2003, with a sponsorship from [[W. W. Grainger]], who had previously sponsored him in the Busch and Truck Series. He earned his first win in the [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] that season and finished second to [[Jamie McMurray]] (who would later join him as a teammate at Roush) for Raybestos Rookie of the Year. Biffle placed 20th in the final points standings.\n\nBiffle made an immediate impact in his sophomore season in 2004, earning the pole in the Daytona 500. However, Biffle was forced to start at the rear due to an engine change. Despite missing NASCAR's first-ever [[Chase for the Sprint Cup|Chase for the NEXTEL Cup]], Biffle won twice that season, at [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]] and Homestead en route to a 17th-place finish in the final points standings.\n\n2005 was Biffle's breakout season. He won six races (at California Speedway, Texas, Darlington, Dover, and Michigan along with the season finale at Homestead), the most of any driver that year, and qualified for the Chase for the first time in his career, bringing home a second-place finish in the standings, 35 points behind champion [[Tony Stewart]]; Biffle tied with his teammate [[Carl Edwards]] in points but won the tie-breaker based on race wins.\n\nBiffle regressed in 2006, missing the Chase for the Cup despite winning twice at [[Darlington Raceway]] and [[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway|Homestead-Miami Speedway]] (both of which were tracks at which he had also won in the previous season). He finished 13th in the standings, third-best of the drivers not to qualify for the Chase. He also missed the Chase the following year, in a season marred by the No. 16 team's new primary sponsor [[Ameriquest Mortgage]] suffering financial difficulty and having to sell off a number of its race sponsorships. Biffle won only one race in 2007, at [[Kansas Speedway]]. As Biffle was doing burnouts on the track, third place [[Jimmie Johnson]] and second place [[Clint Bowyer]] accused Biffle of not maintaining speed under a final lap caution but this was denied by NASCAR who said Biffle had pace car speed.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn 2007, Biffle finished 14th in the standings, second-best of the non-Chase drivers as the Chase expanded to a 12-driver format that year.\n\nIn June 2008, Biffle signed a year-long contract extension with Roush Fenway Racing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnextinc.com/nascar/drivers/news/greg_biffle.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110604213838/http://www.gnextinc.com/nascar/drivers/news/greg_biffle.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |title=Biffle signs 3-year extension with Roush Fenway |publisher=Gnextinc.com |accessdate=June 21, 2013 }}</ref> Despite going winless during the 26-race regular season, Biffle made for the Chase for the Sprint Cup that year and won the first two Chase races, at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|New Hampshire]] and [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]]. In doing so, he became the first driver to win the first two Chase races in a season.\n\nBiffle qualified for the Chase for the second year in a row in 2009 but for the first time since 2002 (when he ran a limited schedule), failed to record a win. During a test in January 2009 at Texas World Speedway, Biffle managed to reach {{convert|218|mi/h}} in a test for [[Roush Fenway Racing]] as part of evading NASCAR's testing ban. This became the fastest time ever achieved on this track by any competitor (amateur or professional).\n\nIn 2010, Biffle qualified for the third year in a row for the Chase despite spotty performance in the regular season. He won twice at Pocono and Kansas.\nIn 2011, Biffle's season improved, thanks in part to the implementation of Ford's new FR9 engine. However, crew chief [[Greg Erwin]] was replaced after Kentucky by Matt Puccia. The addition of Puccia helped Biffle's performance late in the season, despite the team missing the Chase and finishing 16th in points. Biffle missed the Chase in 2011 for the first time since 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2012/12/12/gbiffle-season-in-review-2012.html |title=Year in Review: Slow start in Chase cost Biffle chance at winning championship |publisher=NASCAR.com |date=December 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greg Biffle, 2013 STP Gas Booster 500.JPG|thumb|Biffle competes in the [[2013 STP Gas Booster 500]]]]\nIn 2012, Biffle and Puccia remained at RFR, and gained the points lead after Las Vegas after three consecutive third-place finishes.

He currently competes part-time in the [[Stadium Super Trucks]] in the [[Continental Tire]] truck, and part time in the [[24 Hours of LeMans]]. After racing in the NASCAR [[Winter Heat Series]] in the mid-1990s, he was recommended to [[Jack Roush]] by former announcer [[Benny Parsons]]. With [[Roush Racing]], he was the [[1998 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series]] [[1998 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series#Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]].  He won the [[2000 NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|2000 Craftsman Truck championship]]. He reprised this progression in the [[NASCAR Busch Series]], winning the [[2001 NASCAR Busch Series|2001 Rookie of the Year]], immediately followed by winning the [[2002 NASCAR Busch Series|2002 championship]]. Biffle drove in the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series]] for Roush from [[2003 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|2003]] until [[2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2016]], winning 19 races in the No. 16 Ford. He currently is also an analyst for [[NBC Sports]]' show ''[[NASCAR America]]''.\n\nBiffle, who began his NASCAR career in 1995, is the first of only three drivers that have [[List of NASCAR drivers who have won in each of top three series#Driver championships in two of the top divisions|won a championship in both]] the [[NASCAR Busch Series|Busch Series]] and the [[NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]], and the sixth of only twenty-nine drivers to [[List of NASCAR drivers who have won in each of top three series#Triple Threat|win a race in each of NASCAR's three national series]]. Biffle returned to NASCAR in 2019 when he ran the [[2019 SpeedyCash.com 400]] for [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]], where he won.\n\n==Racing career==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=May 2017}}\nBiffle was born and raised in [[Camas, Washington]].<ref>http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/drivers/dps/gbiffle00  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214072900/http://nationwide.nascar.com/nationwide-series/drivers/dps/gbiffle00|date=February 14, 2010}}</ref> He began his racing career driving on [[Short track motor racing|short tracks]] around the [[Pacific Northwest]]. He first gained attention as a driver when he raced in the nationally televised [[Winter Heat Series]] in the winter of 1995\u20131996. Biffle dominated the series championship that winter, leading former ESPN announcer and NASCAR champion, [[Benny Parsons]], to recommend the driver to [[Jack Roush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.roushracing.com/Greg_Biffle/default.asp?page=/greg_biffle/gbbio.htm&menu=greg|title=Greg Biffle|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927223933/http://www.roushracing.com/Greg_Biffle/default.asp?page=%2Fgreg_biffle%2Fgbbio.htm&menu=greg|archivedate=September 27, 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nBiffle entered the first two races of the 1996 [[NASCAR Camping World West Series|Winston West Series]], finishing 30th at [[Tucson Raceway Park|Tucson]] and 4th at [[Altamont Raceway Park|Altamont]]. His debut in one of NASCAR's national divisions came later that year when he ran the final two [[Nationwide Series|Busch Series]] races of the season. Driving a [[Chevrolet]] for Dick Bown, he finished 23rd at [[Rockingham Speedway|Rockingham]] but lost an engine the following race at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead]] and finished 36th. In 1997, Biffle competed in the now-defunct [[NASCAR AutoZone Elite Division, Northwest Series|NASCAR Northwest Series]] and won the Most Popular Driver Award.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://racingone.com/driver.aspx?driverid=214&seriesID=1&subID=1|title=Greg Biffle Profile|publisher=Racingone.com|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103113105/http://racingone.com/driver.aspx?driverID=214&seriesID=1&subid=1|archive-date=January 3, 2010|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Gander Outdoors Truck Series===\nRoush Racing promoted Biffle to a full-time driver in the [[Camping World Truck Series|Craftsman Truck Series]] in 1998. Despite not winning a race that season, Biffle's four pole positions are the most by a Truck Series rookie to date and they helped him earn an 8th-place finish in the final standings and the [[NASCAR Rookie of the Year|Rookie of the Year]] Award. He followed it up with a stellar 1999 season in which he recorded nine wins, a single-season Truck Series record that still stands {{as of |2018 |lc=y}}. He finished second in the final standings, just eight points behind champion [[Jack Sprague]].\n\nIn 2000, Biffle won the Truck Series title with another five-win season, beating his Roush teammate [[Kurt Busch]] by 230 points. It was Biffle's first championship in one of NASCAR's three major series. It was announced that Biffle would move up to the Busch Series for 2001, however, he ran four more Truck races for Roush that season and won at Phoenix. Biffle made a Truck Series start in 2004 for another long-time Ford team, [[Circle Bar Racing]], at Homestead.\n\n[[File:Biffle at Texas 2019.jpg|thumb|Biffle ahead of [[Matt Crafton]] at [[Texas Motor Speedway|Texas]] in 2019.]]\nOn March 28, 2019, Biffle announced he would be testing with [[Kyle Busch Motorsports]] the next day at [[Texas Motor Speedway]] in the No. 51 truck.

The following season, he won another four races and earned 20 top-five finishes out of 34 races en route to his first Busch Series title and the second NASCAR national championship of his career.\n\nHe ran only part-time in 2003 as Roush moved him up to a full-time ride in the [[Sprint Cup Series|Winston Cup Series]] for that season, but he returned to contend for the Busch Series championship again in 2004. He placed third in the standings behind [[Martin Truex Jr.]] and [[Kyle Busch]]. From 2005 to 2009, Biffle raced part-time for Roush Fenway Racing in the Busch (now Xfinity Series) every year. He won twice in 2009, at [[Las Vegas Motor Speedway|Las Vegas]] and [[Phoenix International Raceway|Phoenix]], after going winless the previous two seasons. Biffle returned to the Nationwide Series in 2010, driving the No. 27 Ford for [[Baker Curb Racing]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/bg/01/09/gbiffle.baker.curb/index.html|title=Biffle back at Baker Curb, will drive No. 27 Ford|publisher=NASCAR.com |date=January 9, 2010|accessdate=June 21, 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112121835/http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/bg/01/09/gbiffle.baker.curb/index.html|archivedate=January 12, 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Sprint Cup Series===\n[[File:Greg Biffle 2008 3M Ford Fusion.jpg|thumb|left|2008 Cup racecar]]\nBiffle began his Cup Series career in the 2002 season. He attempted to qualify in a Roush Ford for the [[2002 Daytona 500]] but failed to make the race. He would make his first Cup debut nine races later at [[Auto Club Speedway|California]], a race in which he finished 13th. That was his best finish in seven races that year as he also drove four in a Chevrolet for [[Andy Petree Racing]] and two in a Dodge for [[Petty Enterprises]].\n\nBiffle began competing full-time in NASCAR's top division in 2003, with a sponsorship from [[W. W. Grainger]], who had previously sponsored him in the Busch and Truck Series. He earned his first win in the [[Coke Zero 400|Pepsi 400]] at [[Daytona International Speedway|Daytona]] that season and finished second to [[Jamie McMurray]] (who would later join him as a teammate at Roush) for Raybestos Rookie of the Year. Biffle placed 20th in the final points standings.\n\nBiffle made an immediate impact in his sophomore season in 2004, earning the pole in the Daytona 500. However, Biffle was forced to start at the rear due to an engine change. Despite missing NASCAR's first-ever [[Chase for the Sprint Cup|Chase for the NEXTEL Cup]], Biffle won twice that season, at [[Michigan International Speedway|Michigan]] and Homestead en route to a 17th-place finish in the final points standings.\n\n2005 was Biffle's breakout season. He won six races (at California Speedway, Texas, Darlington, Dover, and Michigan along with the season finale at Homestead), the most of any driver that year, and qualified for the Chase for the first time in his career, bringing home a second-place finish in the standings, 35 points behind champion [[Tony Stewart]]; Biffle tied with his teammate [[Carl Edwards]] in points but won the tie-breaker based on race wins.\n\nBiffle regressed in 2006, missing the Chase for the Cup despite winning twice at [[Darlington Raceway]] and [[Homestead\u2013Miami Speedway|Homestead-Miami Speedway]] (both of which were tracks at which he had also won in the previous season). He finished 13th in the standings, third-best of the drivers not to qualify for the Chase. He also missed the Chase the following year, in a season marred by the No. 16 team's new primary sponsor [[Ameriquest Mortgage]] suffering financial difficulty and having to sell off a number of its race sponsorships. Biffle won only one race in 2007, at [[Kansas Speedway]]. As Biffle was doing burnouts on the track, third place [[Jimmie Johnson]] and second place [[Clint Bowyer]] accused Biffle of not maintaining speed under a final lap caution but this was denied by NASCAR who said Biffle had pace car speed.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nIn 2007, Biffle finished 14th in the standings, second-best of the non-Chase drivers as the Chase expanded to a 12-driver format that year.\n\nIn June 2008, Biffle signed a year-long contract extension with Roush Fenway Racing.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gnextinc.com/nascar/drivers/news/greg_biffle.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110604213838/http://www.gnextinc.com/nascar/drivers/news/greg_biffle.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=June 4, 2011 |title=Biffle signs 3-year extension with Roush Fenway |publisher=Gnextinc.com |accessdate=June 21, 2013 }}</ref> Despite going winless during the 26-race regular season, Biffle made for the Chase for the Sprint Cup that year and won the first two Chase races, at [[New Hampshire Motor Speedway|New Hampshire]] and [[Dover International Speedway|Dover]]. In doing so, he became the first driver to win the first two Chase races in a season.\n\nBiffle qualified for the Chase for the second year in a row in 2009 but for the first time since 2002 (when he ran a limited schedule), failed to record a win. During a test in January 2009 at Texas World Speedway, Biffle managed to reach {{convert|218|mi/h}} in a test for [[Roush Fenway Racing]] as part of evading NASCAR's testing ban. This became the fastest time ever achieved on this track by any competitor (amateur or professional).\n\nIn 2010, Biffle qualified for the third year in a row for the Chase despite spotty performance in the regular season. He won twice at Pocono and Kansas.\nIn 2011, Biffle's season improved, thanks in part to the implementation of Ford's new FR9 engine. However, crew chief [[Greg Erwin]] was replaced after Kentucky by Matt Puccia. The addition of Puccia helped Biffle's performance late in the season, despite the team missing the Chase and finishing 16th in points. Biffle missed the Chase in 2011 for the first time since 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/en_us/news-media/articles/2012/12/12/gbiffle-season-in-review-2012.html |title=Year in Review: Slow start in Chase cost Biffle chance at winning championship |publisher=NASCAR.com |date=December 12, 2012 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Greg Biffle, 2013 STP Gas Booster 500.JPG|thumb|Biffle competes in the [[2013 STP Gas Booster 500]]]]\nIn 2012, Biffle and Puccia remained at RFR, and gained the points lead after Las Vegas after three consecutive third-place finishes. At the [[2012 Daytona 500]], Biffle found himself second coming to the white flag for the third time in two years and again finished third. Eerily, the third place at Vegas came in Biffle's 333rd Cup start.

He struggled mightily before picking up a second-place finish in the [[2015 Coca-Cola 600]], after starting fourth. He went on to pick up a fifth-place finish at Pocono in the [[2015 Windows 10 400]] and a fourth-place at New Hampshire in the [[2015 Sylvania 300]], finishing twenty in points.\n\nOrtho announced they would depart Roush following the 2015 season, leaving Biffle without a primary sponsor for the [[2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2016 season]]. KFC then announced they would sponsor Biffle throughout speedweeks and in the Daytona 500. He earned his first pole position in four seasons during qualifying for the [[2016 Coke Zero 400|Coke Zero 400 at Daytona]], and went on to finish eighth in the race.\n\nAfter finishing 23rd in points in [[2016 NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|2016]], Biffle and Roush Fenway mutually parted ways, making Biffle a free agent for the upcoming 2017 season.
