Starting in November 2013, it has been republished by [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] with new colors and improved scans of the original artwork by [[Sam Kieth]] and Jim Sinclair. The [[comic book]], starring an eponymous purple hero, spawned an animated series on [[MTV]]. The first appearance of The Maxx was in ''Primer'' #5, published by [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico Comics]].<ref>Overstreet, Robert M. ''The Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide''. Gemstone Publishing, Inc. page 786. 2007.</ref>\n\nThe series follows the adventures of the titular hero both in the real world and in an alternate reality referred to as the Outback. In the real world, the Maxx is a vagrant, a \"homeless man living in a box\", while in the Outback, he is the powerful protector of the Jungle Queen. The Jungle Queen exists in the real world as Julie Winters, a freelance [[social work]]er, who often bails the Maxx out of jail. While the Maxx is aware of the Outback, Julie is not, though it is integral to both of their stories.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n===Main story arc===\n[[Mister Gone|Mr. Gone]], a [[rape|serial rapist]] with a [[telepathy|telepathic]] link to Julie, has extensive knowledge of and access to other people's Outbacks. He starts phoning Julie, but she thinks he is merely an obscene phone caller and ignores him. Eventually, the Maxx gets in Gone's way by \"protecting\" Julie. Gone tries to kill him with assistance from the Outback's main predators, the Isz. The Maxx fights him in both the Outback and the real world.\n\nEventually, Mr. Gone makes Julie see the truth about her past and reveals to her how the Maxx came to be. Gone first met Julie when she was a child as \"Uncle Artie\", a friend of her father; his tall tales about a visit to Australia helped shape Julie's Outback. As Julie begins healing herself and the Outback, the series starts following Sara, a [[clinical depression|depressed]] teenager whose mother sends her to Julie for [[counseling]]. Sara is often in conflict with her mother, who disciplines her so she won't grow up to be like her father - Mr. Gone.\n\n===Backstory===\nThe backstories of several characters are revealed midway through the series. While in college, Julie picks up a hitch-hiker who beats and [[rape]]s her before leaving her to die. To [[coping (psychology)|cope]], she hides in what is referred to as her 'Outback' (a primeval landscape situated entirely in her [[subconscious]], where she has control). In the Outback, she becomes \"The Jungle Queen\", an all-powerful goddess. She spends so much time dwelling in her Outback that the real world and the Outback gradually become unstable.\n\nOne night, she accidentally hits a [[homeless]] man with her car. Remembering what happened the last time she stopped to help someone, she covers the unconscious body with trash, but in doing so she unintentionally opens a link to the Outback. After Julie leaves, a lampshade in the trash (which had brushed the Outback) expands over the man's body, becoming a mask that costumes him and links him to Julie.\n\n===Second storyline===\nAfter the conclusion of the first storyline, the action leaps forward from 1995 (the then-present) to the year 2005. Julie and Dave (the former Maxx) having vanished, the action focuses on Sara (as she now spells her name) and Iago, a giant, murderous [[banana slug]] from her Outback. Iago has a list of people to kill, and it turns out that Julie and Sara are both on it. Sara is hounded by a homeless man named Norbert whom she soon realizes is her Maxx. Sara has constant confrontations with Mr. Gone, who is repentant of his past crimes. He is visited by three special agents intent on arresting him, but he turns them into insects. Later, after reading a diary he leaves for her that reveals his tragic [[origin story]], Sara eventually feels sympathy for and a connection to her father. She also begins developing a strange power that she may be inheriting from Mr. Gone.\n\nJulie and Dave return to the story after Julie is attacked by Iago and loses a few fingers. It turns out that Julie abandoned her son, Mark, to keep him safe from Iago. She tries to have Dave tell Mark that she's dead so he will stop seeking her out, but Mark doesn't believe him. Sara, Dave, Mark, Mr. Gone and Norbert band together to rescue Julie from Iago, who kidnaps her and takes her into Sara's outback. Norbert cuts Iago open, apparently defeating him, but Julie has already escaped.\n\nMr. Gone soon reveals that time is unraveling for the group, which now includes Glorie, one of Mr. Gone's past victims who now has a friendly relationship with him. Gone returns Dave's Maxx power to him. Sara returns as a being whom different people perceive as a giant Isz, pink fairy, or football. Mark has an odd dream about eccentric kidnappers. Each member of the group begins to disappear from reality to be reborn in another. Before Mr. Gone can disappear, the three agents who previously tried to arrest him and now appear as humanoid beings with insect bug heads, return and kill him, as he expected. Mark is the last to disappear.\n\nIn Julie's outback, Mr. Gone is reunited with Sara, who is now a child again. The Maxx considers attacking him, but the Jungle Queen says to leave him be, because even evil deserves a place to rest.\n\nIn the new reality, Mr. Gone is a professor and Dave is a janitor at his school. Julie and Mark are still mother and son, but seem to live in better conditions. All the principal characters now lead completely different lives, yet retain a small part of their connection to the Outback and to each other.\n\n==Spirit animals==\nOne of the dominant concepts of ''The Maxx'' is that every human being has a [[totem|spirit animal]], which is linked to the person during a pivotal moment in their life. Julie's spirit animal is a rabbit. When she was very young, Julie rescued a dying rabbit that lay in the road in front of her house (as seen in ''The Maxx'' #12). Julie later witnessed her mother bludgeoning the rabbit to death with a shovel to put it out of its misery. This [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic event linked the rabbit to Julie's subconscious. Julie projects the rabbit onto Dave as she tries to take care of him like the rabbit she was unable to save. Maxx, who is linked to Julie and her spirit animal, worries that, if he removes his mask, he will find the head of a rabbit beneath it.\n\nSarah's spirit animal is a horse. In the latter half of the series, this spirit animal manifests itself as Norbert, a homeless man she takes pity on.\n\n==Isz==\nThe main inhabitants of The Outback, the Isz are small, eyeless beings with egg-shaped bodies, arms and legs, about as large as housecats. The omnivorous white Isz of the Outback become [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] black Isz when brought into the real world. They are stronger, faster, and have sharper teeth than white Isz. However, in one instance, a single White Isz was able to cross over into the real world unchanged when there was a small punctured hole in an alley wall that directly connected both realities. The Black Isz proceeded to torture their less aggressive kin after its initial mission had been completed, showing the completely opposite degrees of aggression the two types exhibit. The Black Isz can assume different appearances depending on the clothes they wear, and their intent. If an Isz is dressed as an elderly woman, it appears as such to anyone who does not know already that it is an Isz. In the latter part of the series, Sara's Isz appear as pink, flying, eyeless [[fairy|fairie]]s that explode if not kept in water.\n\n==Collected editions==\nThe comics have been collected into a number of [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]:\n\n*''The Maxx'' Book 1: Issues #1\u20136, {{ISBN|1-4012-0124-5}}\n*''The Maxx'' Book 2: Issues #7\u201313, [[Darker Image]] #1 {{ISBN|1-4012-0280-2}}\n*''The Maxx'' Book 3: Issues #14\u201320 {{ISBN|1-4012-0298-5}}\n*''The Maxx'' Book 4: Issues #21\u201327 {{ISBN|1-4012-0613-1}}\n*''The Maxx'' Book 5: Issues #28\u201335 {{ISBN|1-4012-0621-2}}\n*''The Maxx'' Book 6: Collects the spin-off series ''Friends of Maxx'' {{ISBN|1-4012-0946-7}}\n\nThe IDW reissues of the comics have also been collected:\n\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 1: Issues #1\u20134, {{ISBN|978-1613779590}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 2: Issues #5\u20138, {{ISBN|978-1631401046}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 3: Issues #9\u201312, {{ISBN|978-1631402029}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 4: Issues #13\u201318, {{ISBN|978-1631403231}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 5: Issues #19\u201324, {{ISBN|978-1631405136}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 6: Issues #25-30, {{ISBN|1631406612}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 7: Issues #31-35, {{ISBN|1631408003}}\nOther issues include ''The Maxx'' #\u00bd and a ''[[Gen\u00b9\u00b3]]/The Maxx'' [[Intercompany crossover|crossover]], as well as the first issue of ''[[Darker Image]]'', an incomplete anthology series from [[Image Comics]].\n*''Batman/The Maxx: Arkham Dreams'': Issues 1\u20135, {{ISBN|978-1684054329}}\n\n==Cameos==\nThe Maxx has made cameo appearances in the graphic novel ''Popbot'' (which Kieth co-wrote), issue #1 of the independent comic ''Armature'', the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] comic ''Sonic Super Special ''#7 Sonic/Image Crossover, the four issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Altered Image'', the Image mini-series'' [[Blood Wolf]]'' (1995) and ''The [[Savage Dragon]]'' #28 (collected in ''Savage Dragon Vol. 7: A Talk With God'').

Starting in November 2013, it has been republished by [[IDW Publishing|IDW]] with new colors and improved scans of the original artwork by [[Sam Kieth]] and Jim Sinclair. The [[comic book]], starring an eponymous purple hero, spawned an animated series on [[MTV]]. The first appearance of The Maxx was in ''Primer'' #5, published by [[Comico: The Comic Company|Comico Comics]].<ref>Overstreet, Robert M. ''The Official Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide''. Gemstone Publishing, Inc. page 786. 2007.</ref>\n\nThe series follows the adventures of the titular hero both in the real world and in an alternate reality referred to as the Outback. In the real world, the Maxx is a vagrant, a \"homeless man living in a box\", while in the Outback, he is the powerful protector of the Jungle Queen. The Jungle Queen exists in the real world as Julie Winters, a freelance [[social work]]er, who often bails the Maxx out of jail. While the Maxx is aware of the Outback, Julie is not, though it is integral to both of their stories.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\n===Main story arc===\n[[Mister Gone|Mr. Gone]], a [[rape|serial rapist]] with a [[telepathy|telepathic]] link to Julie, has extensive knowledge of and access to other people's Outbacks. He starts phoning Julie, but she thinks he is merely an obscene phone caller and ignores him. Eventually, the Maxx gets in Gone's way by \"protecting\" Julie. Gone tries to kill him with assistance from the Outback's main predators, the Isz. The Maxx fights him in both the Outback and the real world.\n\nEventually, Mr. Gone makes Julie see the truth about her past and reveals to her how the Maxx came to be. Gone first met Julie when she was a child as \"Uncle Artie\", a friend of her father; his tall tales about a visit to Australia helped shape Julie's Outback. As Julie begins healing herself and the Outback, the series starts following Sara, a [[clinical depression|depressed]] teenager whose mother sends her to Julie for [[counseling]]. Sara is often in conflict with her mother, who disciplines her so she won't grow up to be like her father - Mr. Gone.\n\n===Backstory===\nThe backstories of several characters are revealed midway through the series. While in college, Julie picks up a hitch-hiker who beats and [[rape]]s her before leaving her to die. To [[coping (psychology)|cope]], she hides in what is referred to as her 'Outback' (a primeval landscape situated entirely in her [[subconscious]], where she has control). In the Outback, she becomes \"The Jungle Queen\", an all-powerful goddess. She spends so much time dwelling in her Outback that the real world and the Outback gradually become unstable.\n\nOne night, she accidentally hits a [[homeless]] man with her car. Remembering what happened the last time she stopped to help someone, she covers the unconscious body with trash, but in doing so she unintentionally opens a link to the Outback. After Julie leaves, a lampshade in the trash (which had brushed the Outback) expands over the man's body, becoming a mask that costumes him and links him to Julie.\n\n===Second storyline===\nAfter the conclusion of the first storyline, the action leaps forward from 1995 (the then-present) to the year 2005. Julie and Dave (the former Maxx) having vanished, the action focuses on Sara (as she now spells her name) and Iago, a giant, murderous [[banana slug]] from her Outback. Iago has a list of people to kill, and it turns out that Julie and Sara are both on it. Sara is hounded by a homeless man named Norbert whom she soon realizes is her Maxx. Sara has constant confrontations with Mr. Gone, who is repentant of his past crimes. He is visited by three special agents intent on arresting him, but he turns them into insects. Later, after reading a diary he leaves for her that reveals his tragic [[origin story]], Sara eventually feels sympathy for and a connection to her father. She also begins developing a strange power that she may be inheriting from Mr. Gone.\n\nJulie and Dave return to the story after Julie is attacked by Iago and loses a few fingers. It turns out that Julie abandoned her son, Mark, to keep him safe from Iago. She tries to have Dave tell Mark that she's dead so he will stop seeking her out, but Mark doesn't believe him. Sara, Dave, Mark, Mr. Gone and Norbert band together to rescue Julie from Iago, who kidnaps her and takes her into Sara's outback. Norbert cuts Iago open, apparently defeating him, but Julie has already escaped.\n\nMr. Gone soon reveals that time is unraveling for the group, which now includes Glorie, one of Mr. Gone's past victims who now has a friendly relationship with him. Gone returns Dave's Maxx power to him. Sara returns as a being whom different people perceive as a giant Isz, pink fairy, or football. Mark has an odd dream about eccentric kidnappers. Each member of the group begins to disappear from reality to be reborn in another. Before Mr. Gone can disappear, the three agents who previously tried to arrest him and now appear as humanoid beings with insect bug heads, return and kill him, as he expected. Mark is the last to disappear.\n\nIn Julie's outback, Mr. Gone is reunited with Sara, who is now a child again. The Maxx considers attacking him, but the Jungle Queen says to leave him be, because even evil deserves a place to rest.\n\nIn the new reality, Mr. Gone is a professor and Dave is a janitor at his school. Julie and Mark are still mother and son, but seem to live in better conditions. All the principal characters now lead completely different lives, yet retain a small part of their connection to the Outback and to each other.\n\n==Spirit animals==\nOne of the dominant concepts of ''The Maxx'' is that every human being has a [[totem|spirit animal]], which is linked to the person during a pivotal moment in their life. Julie's spirit animal is a rabbit. When she was very young, Julie rescued a dying rabbit that lay in the road in front of her house (as seen in ''The Maxx'' #12). Julie later witnessed her mother bludgeoning the rabbit to death with a shovel to put it out of its misery. This [[Psychological trauma|trauma]]tic event linked the rabbit to Julie's subconscious. Julie projects the rabbit onto Dave as she tries to take care of him like the rabbit she was unable to save. Maxx, who is linked to Julie and her spirit animal, worries that, if he removes his mask, he will find the head of a rabbit beneath it.\n\nSarah's spirit animal is a horse. In the latter half of the series, this spirit animal manifests itself as Norbert, a homeless man she takes pity on.\n\n==Isz==\nThe main inhabitants of The Outback, the Isz are small, eyeless beings with egg-shaped bodies, arms and legs, about as large as housecats. The omnivorous white Isz of the Outback become [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] black Isz when brought into the real world. They are stronger, faster, and have sharper teeth than white Isz. However, in one instance, a single White Isz was able to cross over into the real world unchanged when there was a small punctured hole in an alley wall that directly connected both realities. The Black Isz proceeded to torture their less aggressive kin after its initial mission had been completed, showing the completely opposite degrees of aggression the two types exhibit. The Black Isz can assume different appearances depending on the clothes they wear, and their intent. If an Isz is dressed as an elderly woman, it appears as such to anyone who does not know already that it is an Isz. In the latter part of the series, Sara's Isz appear as pink, flying, eyeless [[fairy|fairie]]s that explode if not kept in water.\n\n==Collected editions==\nThe comics have been collected into a number of [[trade paperback (comics)|trade paperbacks]]:\n\n*''The Maxx'' Book 1: Issues #1\u20136, {{ISBN|1-4012-0124-5}}\n*''The Maxx'' Book 2: Issues #7\u201313, [[Darker Image]] #1 {{ISBN|1-4012-0280-2}}\n*''The Maxx'' Book 3: Issues #14\u201320 {{ISBN|1-4012-0298-5}}\n*''The Maxx'' Book 4: Issues #21\u201327 {{ISBN|1-4012-0613-1}}\n*''The Maxx'' Book 5: Issues #28\u201335 {{ISBN|1-4012-0621-2}}\n*''The Maxx'' Book 6: Collects the spin-off series ''Friends of Maxx'' {{ISBN|1-4012-0946-7}}\n\nThe IDW reissues of the comics have also been collected:\n\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 1: Issues #1\u20134, {{ISBN|978-1613779590}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 2: Issues #5\u20138, {{ISBN|978-1631401046}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 3: Issues #9\u201312, {{ISBN|978-1631402029}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 4: Issues #13\u201318, {{ISBN|978-1631403231}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 5: Issues #19\u201324, {{ISBN|978-1631405136}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 6: Issues #25-30, {{ISBN|1631406612}}\n*''The Maxx'' Maxximized Volume 7: Issues #31-35, {{ISBN|1631408003}}\nOther issues include ''The Maxx'' #\u00bd and a ''[[Gen\u00b9\u00b3]]/The Maxx'' [[Intercompany crossover|crossover]], as well as the first issue of ''[[Darker Image]]'', an incomplete anthology series from [[Image Comics]].\n*''Batman/The Maxx: Arkham Dreams'': Issues 1\u20135, {{ISBN|978-1684054329}}\n\n==Cameos==\nThe Maxx has made cameo appearances in the graphic novel ''Popbot'' (which Kieth co-wrote), issue #1 of the independent comic ''Armature'', the [[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] comic ''Sonic Super Special ''#7 Sonic/Image Crossover, the four issue [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Altered Image'', the Image mini-series'' [[Blood Wolf]]'' (1995) and ''The [[Savage Dragon]]'' #28 (collected in ''Savage Dragon Vol. 7: A Talk With God'').

Confirming that the man was dead, Richards disposed of the body in the nearby river.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=13}}\n\nSeveral days later, while continuing towards Kearney, Richards encountered another stranger who was traveling on foot.

Richards later stated that he waited until the stranger's back was turned, at which point he shot him in the back of the head, killing him. After disposing of the body, he later sold the stranger's horse in a nearby town before continuing on the road to Kearney.

Near the end of their journey, they camped for the night along the [[Platte River]] between [[Lowell, Nebraska|Lowell]] and Kearney. Richards woke at around 3 a.m. and aroused his partner, telling him that it was almost morning and that they ought to get back on the road; Gemge, infuriated at being woken so early, began arguing with Richards about the time.

Mrs. Harlson had been jailed as well, on suspicion of aiding her husband during his escape.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} Richards and Mrs. Harlson agreed that she would sell him the deed to her property for $600, six months later.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=19}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1879|p=7}}\n\nAfter Richards was released from jail, he traveled around Nebraska for several months, doing business in Hastings, Bloomington and Grand Island, before arriving at the Harlson's Kearney County homestead on October 18, 1878. When Richards arrived, Mrs. Harlson transferred her property to him, and he settled down there for several weeks.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}} It was later reported by the ''[[New York Daily Herald]]'' that Richards had married Mrs. Harlson on November 2nd, in what they alleged was a scam in order to acquire ownership of Harlson's land.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}}  A month later, Richards decided to kill Mrs. Harlson and her three children: ten-year-old Daisy, four-year-old Mabel, and two-year-old Jasper, nicknamed \"Jesse.\" (Jasper Harlson was living in Texas at the time).{{sfn|OmahaHerald 1878}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} In his confession, Richards claimed that Mrs. Harlson 'talked too much', and had discovered that  he was guilty of murder: \"She would have 'given me away' had I let her live ... and so, knowing what she did, I thought it the safest plan to put her out of the way,\" he said.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}}\n\nOn November 3, 1878, Richards and another man named Brown, who had been staying at the house, got up early in the morning.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}} Brown went to feed the horses and do other chores around the farm after Brown had left, Richards found a [[spade]] and dug a hole near the house, he then snuck back into the house and murdered Mrs. Harlson, Daisy, Mabel and Jesse with an [[Axe murder|axe]].{{refn|name=Note3|group=Note|According to one report, Mrs. Harlson, and one of the other children were murdered with a [[Steam iron|smoothing iron]], while the others were physically assaulted.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}}}} In Richards' confession, most of the Harlsons died immediately after the first several blows, with the exception of Daisy, whom he claimed had 'writhed in pain for some time' before dying.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|pp=21-22}} After the killings, Richards was said to have scrubbed away the bloodstains on the floor, and on his person, before sitting down for breakfast.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1879|p=7}} Afterward, he carried their bodies out of the house and buried them in the hole that he had made earlier. Later, when he was questioned about the Harlsons disappearance by several people, Richards claimed that they had left with Brown, and did not know when they would return.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}} The bodies of Mrs. Harelson and her children were later discovered on December 11, with conflicting reports stating that they had been concealed underneath a haystack,{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}} rather than buried as Richards had later claimed.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}}\n\n===Murder of Peter Anderson===\nIn December 1878, Richards agreed to help his neighbor, a Swedish immigrant named Peter Anderson, with some work on Anderson's property.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}} On December 9th,{{sfn|SiousCityJournal|1879|p=2}} Anderson became ill after eating a meal Richards had prepared, causing him to suspect Richards had poisoned him.

However, a group of Anderson's neighbors approached Richards that evening in order to inquire about Anderson, whom they had not seen in a while. Arriving at the house, the group discovered Richards hitching up Anderson's horses, and when questioned about Anderson's whereabouts Richards reportedly distracted the group, claiming that Anderson was inside. As the neighbors entered the house, Richards fled the scene on horseback to [[Bloomington, Nebraska|Bloomington]].{{sfn|LincolnJournalStar 2015}}\n\nFleeing the area, Richards traveled east, alternating between horse, train, and foot, passing through Omaha, Chicago, (an article from the ''[[Lincoln Journal Star]]'' alternately claimed that Richards, under the alias Samuel Richards, had instead fled to [[Red Cloud, Nebraska|Red Cloud]] after the murder through Hastings, Chicago).{{sfn|LincolnJournalStar 2015}} While on the run, he met up with Jasper Harlson, the ex-husband of Mrs. Harlson, and Underwood, traveling with them through [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Bridgeport, Ohio]] before reaching his hometown of [[Mount Pleasant, Ohio]].{{sfn|OmahaHerald 1878}}{{sfn|NYTimes|1879|p=2}} Nebraska state Governor [[Silas Garber]] issued an arrest warrant for Richards on December 16, 1878, with the reward of $200 (about $5,173.56 in 2020) for his arrest and conviction.{{sfn|NSHistoricalSociety|1942|p=501}}\n\n===Capture===\nThe circumstances and location of Richards' eventual arrest have varied somewhat, with some newspaper records around that time reporting that Richards was arrested shortly after his arrival in Mount Pleasant.{{sfn|QuadCityTimes|1878|p=1}}{{sfn|Murdock|1879|p=2}} ''[[The Wheeling Daily Intelligencer]]'' reported that, upon arriving in a town near Mount Pleasant, Richards was subsequently identified by an old acquaintance, who detained him with the help of a colleague.{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}} Most records at the time have listed the date of Richards' arrest as being December 24, 1878.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} Though one contemporary source has claimed that Richards was arrested in [[Austin, Texas]] in early 1879,{{sfn|Ramsland|2006|p=4}}  \n\nRichards himself would later claim to have nearly evaded capture in Ohio, stating that he had intended to travel back to Nebraska, as he reasoned it would have been the last place anyone would have bothered to look. Richards also reported a different story of the circumstances of his arrest. In his account, sometime after arriving in his hometown in Jefferson County, he had attended a [[Ballroom dance|ballroom dance]] with two unidentified women. While strolling just outside of town, with the women in attendance, he claimed to have spotted what appeared to be several officers approaching him.

In his final words, Richards launched into an impassioned defense for his actions, again claiming that Anderson's death was in self-defense, while also claiming that he had nothing to do with the murder of the Harlson family. Richards then stated that he \"had faith in Christ\", and pleaded with the crowd to sing with him the hymn ''[[Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing]]''.

In 1876, Richards left his home in Mount Pleasant, heading Westward with the intention of 'seeking his fortune'. For a time, Richards found work at a local [[Sanatorium|asylum]], where he claimed to have lost all empathy towards others during his time there. In his later confessions, Richards claimed to have committed his first murder sometime in late 1876, two weeks after arriving in [[Kearney, Nebraska]]. After committing several other murders, in which he claimed was [[Murder in self defense|self-defense]], Richards later fled after the murder of the Harlson family, eventually being captured in his home town of Mount Pleasant. He was later tried and hanged in 1879, for the murder of Mrs. Harlson and her three children, and for the murder of his neighbor Peter Anderson.\n\nRichards later became known through an [[biography]], which was based on an interview conducted during his final arrest. The biography, which also included entries on other criminals of the time, was published [[posthumously]] in 1879, by the ''[[Nebraska State Journal]]''. Richards was later featured in an episode of [[SyFy Channel]]'s ''[[Paranormal Witness]]'', where his spirit was purported to have tormented a family.\n\n==Early and young adult life==\nStephen Dee Richards was born in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]],{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}}{{refn|name=Note1|group=Note|In a biography published shortly after his execution, its author claimed that Richards was born in Ohio.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}}}} on March 18, 1856.{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}} At the age of six, Richards moved with his family out of state to [[Ohio]], first settling in [[Monroe County, Ohio|Monroe county]], before later moving on to [[Noble County, Ohio|Noble County]].{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}}{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}} At the age of eleven, his family moved once again, settling in the [[Quakers|Quaker]] village of [[Mount Pleasant, Ohio]].

During his residency in Mount Pleasant, Richards attended school, where he claimed that teachers there considered him well-behaved. At his mother's insistence, he also attended [[Sunday school]] and church regularly.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}} \n\nRichards would remain under his parents' roof during this time, working for farmers and other locals in the area. On September 16, 1871, Richards' mother passed away from unknown causes.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=11}}{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}} Several years later, the age of 20, Richards met and became engaged to a young woman named Anna Millhorne, whom he kept regular correspondence with during his later travels up until his final arrest.  Also during this time, Richards came in contact with men of questionable occupation, and began passing around [[Counterfeiting of money|counterfeit bills]] that he claimed, had obtained through a man in [[New York City|New York]]. In February 1876, Richards left Mount Pleasant, heading west to \"seek his fortune\".{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=12}}\n\nFor a time, Richards set up residency in [[Iowa]], where he worked around as a farmhand at various local farms in [[Burlington, Iowa|Burlington]] and [[Morning Sun, Iowa|Morning Sun]]. He was later hired as an attendant at the [[Mount Pleasant Mental Health Institute|Iowa Lunatic Asylum]] in [[Mount Pleasant, Iowa|Mount Pleasant]], where his job was to bury dead patients.

According to his account, Richards met another man while traveling on horseback through the Nebraska countryside, and the pair soon decided to camp out for the night near [[Dobytown, Nebraska|Dobytown]],{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=13}} though several newspaper records have alternately reported that Richards had camped near [[Sandhills (Nebraska)|Sand Hills]].{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}}{{sfn|StateJournal|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|TheWorkingmansFriend|1879|p=1}}  Settling down for the night, the two began gambling in a game of cards, with Richards winning most of the stranger's money. The following morning, as the two set off for Kearney, the stranger turned on Richards, demanding his money back. After refusing to return the man's money, Richards claimed that the man grew belligerent, resulting in Richards shooting him above the left eye, killing the man instantly. Confirming that the man was dead, Richards disposed of the body in the nearby river.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=13}}\n\nSeveral days later, while continuing towards Kearney, Richards encountered another stranger who was traveling on foot. The man told Richards that he had seen him in company with the stranger he had killed several days earlier and asked what had become of him;{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=13}}{{refn|name=Note2|group=Note|In his confession, Richards stated that the stranger had identified the murdered man as being named John, although he later admitted that he was unable to find out the man's last name.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=14}}}} in the course of the conversation, he realized that the two men were friends and business partners. Although he denied any knowledge of the other man, the stranger continued to hound Richards with questions.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=14}} Growing increasingly nervous from the stranger's interrogatory questions, Richards decided to kill the man to stop him from talking. Richards later stated that he waited until the stranger's back was turned, at which point he shot him in the back of the head, killing him. After disposing of the body, he later sold the stranger's horse in a nearby town before continuing on the road to Kearney. Before arriving at Kerney, Richards later stopped at the home of Jasper Harleson.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=14}} Jasper's wife Mary,{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|TheWorkingmansFriend|1879|p=1}} whom Richards described as being a \"free talker\", had noticed that his shirt was stained with blood and had asked him if he had been in a fight. Not realizing this, Richards jokingly replied that it must have come from the men he murdered, which ended the conversation.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=14}}\nTraveling to [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], Richards used [[counterfeit money]] to purchase a horse and buggy from an unnamed man. Once Richards had left, the man soon discovered that the cash was counterfeit and tracked Richards down, demanding either good money or the return of his horse and buggy.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=15}} Richards initially refused, whereupon the man threatened to have him arrested. In response, Richards shot the man, burying his corpse before leaving the area.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=16}}\n\nIn March 1877, Richards left [[Grand Island, Nebraska]], on horseback with a young man with the last name of Gemge, heading to Kearney. Near the end of their journey, they camped for the night along the [[Platte River]] between [[Lowell, Nebraska|Lowell]] and Kearney. Richards woke at around 3 a.m. and aroused his partner, telling him that it was almost morning and that they ought to get back on the road; Gemge, infuriated at being woken so early, began arguing with Richards about the time. Richards tried explaining to Gemge that it was in fact 3 a.m., at which point Gemge began insulting him.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=17}} Richards later recounted what followed:\n\n{{Quote|text='It's a good thing you don't mean all you say,' I said.

Jasper and another prisoner named Underwood had previously escaped from the Kearney jail, shortly before Richards\u2019 arrival. Mrs. Harlson had been jailed as well, on suspicion of aiding her husband during his escape.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} Richards and Mrs. Harlson agreed that she would sell him the deed to her property for $600, six months later.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=19}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1879|p=7}}\n\nAfter Richards was released from jail, he traveled around Nebraska for several months, doing business in Hastings, Bloomington and Grand Island, before arriving at the Harlson's Kearney County homestead on October 18, 1878. When Richards arrived, Mrs. Harlson transferred her property to him, and he settled down there for several weeks.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}} It was later reported by the ''[[New York Daily Herald]]'' that Richards had married Mrs. Harlson on November 2nd, in what they alleged was a scam in order to acquire ownership of Harlson's land.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}}  A month later, Richards decided to kill Mrs. Harlson and her three children: ten-year-old Daisy, four-year-old Mabel, and two-year-old Jasper, nicknamed \"Jesse.\" (Jasper Harlson was living in Texas at the time).{{sfn|OmahaHerald 1878}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}} In his confession, Richards claimed that Mrs. Harlson 'talked too much', and had discovered that  he was guilty of murder: \"She would have 'given me away' had I let her live ... and so, knowing what she did, I thought it the safest plan to put her out of the way,\" he said.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}}\n\nOn November 3, 1878, Richards and another man named Brown, who had been staying at the house, got up early in the morning.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=20}} Brown went to feed the horses and do other chores around the farm after Brown had left, Richards found a [[spade]] and dug a hole near the house, he then snuck back into the house and murdered Mrs. Harlson, Daisy, Mabel and Jesse with an [[Axe murder|axe]].{{refn|name=Note3|group=Note|According to one report, Mrs. Harlson, and one of the other children were murdered with a [[Steam iron|smoothing iron]], while the others were physically assaulted.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}}{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878b|p=5}}}} In Richards' confession, most of the Harlsons died immediately after the first several blows, with the exception of Daisy, whom he claimed had 'writhed in pain for some time' before dying.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|pp=21-22}} After the killings, Richards was said to have scrubbed away the bloodstains on the floor, and on his person, before sitting down for breakfast.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1879|p=7}} Afterward, he carried their bodies out of the house and buried them in the hole that he had made earlier. Later, when he was questioned about the Harlsons disappearance by several people, Richards claimed that they had left with Brown, and did not know when they would return.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}} The bodies of Mrs. Harelson and her children were later discovered on December 11, with conflicting reports stating that they had been concealed underneath a haystack,{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1878a|p=7}} rather than buried as Richards had later claimed.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}}\n\n===Murder of Peter Anderson===\nIn December 1878, Richards agreed to help his neighbor, a Swedish immigrant named Peter Anderson, with some work on Anderson's property.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=23}} On December 9th,{{sfn|SiousCityJournal|1879|p=2}} Anderson became ill after eating a meal Richards had prepared, causing him to suspect Richards had poisoned him.

However, a group of Anderson's neighbors approached Richards that evening in order to inquire about Anderson, whom they had not seen in a while. Arriving at the house, the group discovered Richards hitching up Anderson's horses, and when questioned about Anderson's whereabouts Richards reportedly distracted the group, claiming that Anderson was inside.

In his account, sometime after arriving in his hometown in Jefferson County, he had attended a [[Ballroom dance|ballroom dance]] with two unidentified women. While strolling just outside of town, with the women in attendance, he claimed to have spotted what appeared to be several officers approaching him.

With the charges of [[murder in the first degree]], Richards pled [[Not guilty plea|not guilty]], arguing  that Anderson's murder was in self-defense, and therefore justifiable.{{sfn|NebraskaAdvertiser|1879|p=2}} After two hours of deliberation,{{sfn|NebraskaAdvertiser|1879|p=2}} Richards was found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging,{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}} with the date for his execution set for April 26th, later that year.{{sfn|NebraskaAdvertiser|1879|p=2}}\n\n===Execution===\nUpon his return to Nebraska, The ''Omaha Herald'' reported: \"Richards manifested supreme indifference to his lot, was perfectly willing to be brought direct to Kearney Junction and said he had as soon died one way as another.\"{{sfn|OmahaHerald 1878}} Shortly after Richards' trial, Sheriff Martin announced that the execution would be open to the public, though he was afraid that the large crowd of onlookers would be roused to violence.{{sfn|StateJournal|1879a|p=4}} Stephen Dee Richards was hanged in Minden on April 26,{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}} 1879.{{sfn|Newton|2006|p=399}} A crowd of approximately 25,000 was said to be in attendance to witness the hanging, and, at precisely 1 pm, Richards was led to the gallows by Sheriff Martin and his deputy. In his final words, Richards launched into an impassioned defense for his actions, again claiming that Anderson's death was in self-defense, while also claiming that he had nothing to do with the murder of the Harlson family. Richards then stated that he \"had faith in Christ\", and pleaded with the crowd to sing with him the hymn ''[[Come Thou Fount of Every Blessing]]''. At precisely 1:17 pm, Richards was hanged from the gallows, with the attending reporter for the ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]]'' stating that it took fifteen minutes for the criminal to die.{{sfn|GlobeDemocrat|1879|p=4}} \n\nAfterwards, his body was buried in a nearby grave,{{sfn|LincolnJournalStar 2015}} which was later dug up and his bones scattered in the streets of Kearney.{{sfn|GlobeDemocrat|1879|p=4}} In 1882, it was reported that ''Kearney County Gazette'' had obtained Richards' skull and had placed it on display,{{sfn|LincolnJournalStar 2015}} the current location of the skull remains unknown.\n\n==Pathology==\n{{Quote box|width= 40%|align=right|quote=\"I have killed nine persons, and I can't say I feel any worse for it.\"{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}}|source = Richards, describing his lack of guilt over his crimes}}\n\nAt the time of Richards' killing spree and execution, [[criminal psychology]] and [[Criminal profiling|profiling]] had not yet become a recognized field of study, having first been utilized during the [[Jack the Ripper|Jack the Ripper murders]] in 1888, nine years after Richards' execution.{{sfn|Bonn|2017}} Richards was observed by many to have displayed a complete lack of remorse towards his crimes, after his arrest.{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|StateJournal|1879b|p=1}} An article in the ''[[New York Daily Herald]]'' reported of Richards' mood after his capture as being 'carefree and cheerful'.{{sfn|NYDailyHerald|1879|p=7}}{{sfn|Murdock|1879|p=2}} Members of the press that interviewed Richards after his arrest were struck by his calm and collected behavior.{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|BelmontChronicle|1879|p=2}}{{sfn|QuadCityTimes|1878|p=1}} During an interview with a reporter from the ''Wheeling Daily Intelligencer'', Richards himself stated that he knew that he would be executed for his crimes, but also stated that he was unafraid of death and was \"ready to meet it\".{{sfn|WDailyIntelligencer|1878|p=1}} When his death sentence was announced by the jury, Richards mood was said to have been cheerful after the verdict.{{sfn|NebraskaAdvertiser|1879|p=2}} In a report for the ''St. Louis Globe-Democrat'', who also expressed doubt over the number of murders Richards claimed to have committed, was said to have broken down during his final moments.{{sfn|GlobeDemocrat|1879|p=4}} \n\nConsidered reasonably handsome by observers, Richards was described by reporters at the time of his arrest as being \"heavily built\", standing approximately six feet tall, with dark hair and blue eyes.{{sfn|QuadCityTimes|1878|p=1}}{{sfn|AtchisonDailyChampion|1878|p=2}}{{sfn|TheWorkingmansFriend|1879|p=1}}\n\n==Legacy==\nBefore his execution in 1879, Richards was interviewed by the Nebraska [[State Journal]].

In the late 1980s, the government began to reform the state-owned enterprise, and during the 1990s and 2000s, many mid-sized and small sized state-owned enterprises were privatized and went public. There are a number of different corporate forms which result in a mixture of public and private capital. In PRC terminology, a state-owned enterprise refers to a particular corporate form, which is increasingly being replaced by the [[public company|listed company]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} State-owned enterprises are mostly governed by both local governments' SASAC and, in the central government, [[State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council|the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council]]. However, some state-owned enterprise were governed by [[China Investment Corporation]] (and its domestic arm [[Central Huijin Investment]]), as well as under the governance of [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] for the university-run enterprises, or some financial institutes that were under the governance of the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAs of 2011, 35% of business activity and 43% of profits in the People's Republic of China resulted from companies in which the state owned a majority interest.

Hence Crown corporations did not play as significant a role in the development of the territory as in many other British territories.\n\nThe [[MTR Corporation]] (MTR) was formed as a Crown corporation, mandated to operate under \"prudent commercial principles\", in 1975. The [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]], operated under a government department, was corporatised in 1982 to imitate the success of MTR (see [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]]).

A big customer might be the government or a government agency. The other type is government agencies which might also do activities competing with private owned companies. They usually are funded by tax money but can also sell services. The government has tried to avoid having agencies doing commercial activities, by separating out areas that compete with private companies into government-owned companies, for example within road construction. The reason is both to avoid unfair competition, and a wish to have [[market economy]] instead of [[plan economy]] as much as possible.

The GAO report did not consider the potential use in the international forum of SOEs as extensions of a nation's foreign policy utensils. A [[government-owned corporation]] is a legal entity that undertakes [[commerce|commercial]] activities on behalf of an owner [[government]]. Their legal status varies from being a part of government to [[joint-stock company|stock companies]] with a state as a regular [[shareholder|stockholder]]. There is no standard definition of a government-owned corporation (GOC) or state-owned enterprise (SOE), although the two terms can be used interchangeably. The defining characteristics are that they have a distinct legal form and that they are established to operate in commercial affairs. While they may also have public policy objectives, GOCs should be differentiated from other forms of government agencies or state entities established to pursue purely non-financial objectives.<ref name=gao>{{cite book|publisher=United States General Accounting Office|title=Report to the Ranking Minority Member, Subcommittee on Post Office and Civil Service, Committee on Governmental Affairs, U.S. Senate - GOVERNMENT CORPORATIONS - Profiles of Existing Government Corporations |pages=1\u201316|date=December 1995|quote=GAO/GGD-96-14|url=https://www.gao.gov/assets/230/222015.pdf}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC right}}\n\n==Government-owned companies==\n\n=== Afghanistan ===\nIn 2009, the [[Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan]] formed the [[Afghan public protection force|Afghan Public Protection Force (APPF)]] as a \"state owned enterprise\" subordinate to the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Ministry of the Interior]].

In the late 1980s, the government began to reform the state-owned enterprise, and during the 1990s and 2000s, many mid-sized and small sized state-owned enterprises were privatized and went public. There are a number of different corporate forms which result in a mixture of public and private capital. In PRC terminology, a state-owned enterprise refers to a particular corporate form, which is increasingly being replaced by the [[public company|listed company]].{{fact|date=January 2017}} State-owned enterprises are mostly governed by both local governments' SASAC and, in the central government, [[State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council|the State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission (SASAC) of the State Council]]. However, some state-owned enterprise were governed by [[China Investment Corporation]] (and its domestic arm [[Central Huijin Investment]]), as well as under the governance of [[Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Education]] for the university-run enterprises, or some financial institutes that were under the governance of the [[Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Finance]].\n\nAs of 2011, 35% of business activity and 43% of profits in the People's Republic of China resulted from companies in which the state owned a majority interest.

Hence Crown corporations did not play as significant a role in the development of the territory as in many other British territories.\n\nThe [[MTR Corporation]] (MTR) was formed as a Crown corporation, mandated to operate under \"prudent commercial principles\", in 1975. The [[Kowloon-Canton Railway]], operated under a government department, was corporatised in 1982 to imitate the success of MTR (see [[Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation]]).

A big customer might be the government or a government agency. The other type is government agencies which might also do activities competing with private owned companies. They usually are funded by tax money but can also sell services. The government has tried to avoid having agencies doing commercial activities, by separating out areas that compete with private companies into government-owned companies, for example within road construction. The reason is both to avoid unfair competition, and a wish to have [[market economy]] instead of [[plan economy]] as much as possible.

At the age of two, she was brought to Hong Kong by her parents.\n\nSiao's first movie appearance was at age six, and she became one of the biggest teen idols in Hong Kong during the late 1960s, along with frequent co-star [[Connie Chan Po-chu]]. The two were often cast in [[wuxia]] films as disciples of the same master and sometimes\u2014when Connie played the male lead\u2014as young heroes in love. Back in the 1960s, Josephine's and Connie's fans maintained a heated rivalry. News of their fans getting into catfights was not uncommon in those days.\n\nUnlike many child stars, Siao made a successful transition to adult stardom, remaining one of Hong Kong's most prolific and popular actresses.  She was also one of the directors (co-directing with Leung Po-Chih \u6881\u666e\u667a) and writers of ''[[Jumping Ash]]'' (\u8df3\u7070). This film is regarded as a prelude to the [[Hong Kong New Wave]] in the 1980s by film critics.\n\nHaving largely missed out on formal education because of her acting career as a child, Siao pursued her studies in later years despite the handicap of increasing deafness and the demands of raising a family (she has two daughters by her second husband).  During this time she made fewer films, but her output included highly praised work such as her award-winning performance in ''Summer Snow'' (1995) as a middle-aged widow trying to cope with her father-in-law suffering from Alzheimer's Disease.\n\nWestern fans of [[martial arts film]]s will probably know her best from the [[Fong Sai-yuk (film)|''Fong Sai-yuk'' films]] made in 1993, in which she played [[Jet Li]]'s [[kung fu]]\u2013fighting mother. (These films were released on Western DVD as ''The Legend''.)\n\nSiao has been retired from show business since 1997 in favour of her work in child psychology.  In particular, she is a noted campaigner against child abuse, and founded the End Child Sexual Abuse Foundation, which she now chairs, in 1999.  She is also a published author.\n\nSome of the milestones in her life include:\n* 1970: Bachelor's degree in Mass Communications and Asian Studies at [[Seton Hall University]]\n* 1974: won the best actress award at Spain Film Festival and Taiwan Film Festival\n* 1990: obtained a master's degree in child psychology from [[Regis University]]\n* 1995: won the best actress award at the Berlin Film

There are currently 69 circuits in the state, divided into 10 judicial administrative districts. Circuit court judges hear and decide both civil and criminal cases. Each of the 249 circuit court judges are elected and serve six-year terms.<ref name=\"bb2019\">{{cite report| url= https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lrb/blue_book/2019_2020 |title= Wisconsin Blue Book 2019-2020 |year= 2019|publisher= State of Wisconsin |location= [[Madison, Wisconsin]] |chapter= The Judiciary |pages= 268-271 |accessdate= January 1, 2020}}</ref>  \n\nOn March 6, 2020, Governor [[Tony Evers]] signed bipartisan legislation to create 12 new circuit court branches to be elected in spring 2021 and take office in fall 2021.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/tony-evers-signs-bill-adding-circuit-court-branches/article_f8fcfe31-c419-5ef3-8da2-29a1c7f84750.html|title= Tony Evers signs bill adding 12 circuit court branches  |newspaper= [[Wisconsin State Journal]] |first= Riley |last= Vetterkind |date= March 6, 2020 |accessdate= March 6, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Structure of the circuit courts==\nThe circuit court system is composed of 69 circuits, with 66 circuits serving a single county, and three circuits serving two counties each.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://wicourts.gov/courts/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit courts|website=wicourts.gov}}</ref> [[Buffalo County, Wisconsin|Buffalo]] and [[Pepin County, Wisconsin|Pepin]]<nowiki/> counties share a circuit, as do [[Florence County, Wisconsin|Florence]] and [[Forest County, Wisconsin|Forest]] counties, and [[Shawano County, Wisconsin|Shawano]] and [[Menominee County, Wisconsin|Menominee]] counties.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> 26 circuit courts are served by a single judge.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> For those circuits with more than one judge, each is elected to a particular seat, or \"branch\" within the court. The [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] Circuit Court has the greatest number of branches with 47.\n\nThe circuit courts are organized into 10 geographical administrative districts. Within each district the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] will appoint a chief judge, a deputy chief judge, and a professional district court administrator.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> With the exception of Milwaukee County, chief judges and their deputies continue to hear cases while serving. Chief judges assign judges to hear only a specific type of case (e.g. civil, criminal, juvenile), equalize the flow of cases, establish court policies and rules, and supervise the finances of the courts they administer. They also work closely with county boards on security, facility, and staffing issues. The chief judges and district court administration meet regularly with the director of state courts to discuss current issues and to advise the Supreme court and the director on matters of statewide concern.\n\nIn 2017, Wisconsin's Supreme Court created a new [[Business courts|Business Court]], the Commercial Docket Pilot Project,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/services/attorney/comcourtpilot.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Commercial Docket Pilot Project|website=www.wicourts.gov|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> located in the Waukesha County Circuit Court and the Eighth Judicial Administrative District.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=91&Issue=1&ArticleID=26094|title=Solutions The Need for Speed: Commercial Court Open for Business|website=WisBar|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> On April 1, 2019, the Supreme Court expanded the Commercial Docket's geographic jurisdiction to encompass the entire state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesscourtsblog.com/wisconsin-expands-the-commercial-docket-pilot-project-to-all-wisconsin-counties/|title=Wisconsin Expands the Commercial Docket Pilot Project to All Wisconsin Counties \u2013 Business Courts Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe Wisconsin circuit courts have original jurisdiction to hear all civil and criminal matters within the state. The court's jurisdiction is conferred by Article VII, Section 8 of the [[Wisconsin Constitution]] and is quite broad. Since the court's subject matter jurisdiction is constitutional rather than statutory, the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] cannot limit it by statute. By comparison, the [[United States Congress]] is empowered to limit the subject matter jurisdiction of federal [[United States district court|District Courts]] if it so chooses.\n\nThe geographic limitations of the circuit court's authority are referred to as \"[[personal jurisdiction]].\" In a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] case, the requirements for personal jurisdiction are governed by chapter 801.05 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Generally speaking, a defendant must either be present in the state, or have sufficient contacts with the state, and the pleadings must have been properly served on the defendant. Personal jurisdiction requirements in a civil case are driven by policy considerations, such as fairness to the defendant, [[comity]], and principals of [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]].\n\nThe circuit court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a criminal case if the defendant violates a Wisconsin law while physically present in Wisconsin. Wisconsin courts also have personal jurisdiction over a defendant who commits an act while out of state that contributes to a crime, the consequences of which occur in Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/forms1/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit court forms|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Limits on exercise of power to decide cases==\nThere are, however, limits on what cases the circuit courts will hear.  They will not hear a case if the parties lack standing, or if the case is moot or is not ripe. Additionally, the circuit court will not hear a case in which it lacks competency. State law distinguishes between the court's jurisdiction (power to hear a case) and its competency (ability to arrive at a valid judgment in a case). A court lacks competency if certain statutory requirements are not satisfied, for example, time limits for filing suit, or requirements as to which circuit should decide a case.\n\nIn addition, the courts are constrained from taking action that will encroach on the powers of the legislative or executive branches. Under the separation of powers doctrine, no branch of government may exercise a power of government assigned exclusively to another branch. The purpose of separating powers among the branches of government is to avoid concentration of governmental power in the hands of a new and to give the various branches the ability to check actions by the other branches.\n\nIn reviewing the validity of state laws, the courts are limited to determining whether the law violates any provision of the constitution. The courts may invalidate a law that violates individual rights, such as the right to equal protection or due process, or a law that is not enacted according to the process established in the constitution, for example, a bill that was not passed by a majority of the members of each house of the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]]. However, a court may not invalidate a law because the court finds that the legislature's method for addressing a problem was not the most efficient. Nor may the court substitute its determination of what is in the public interest for the determination of the legislature.\n\nWhile the separation of powers doctrine limits the ability of the courts to act, it also protects the courts from encroachment by the legislature of governor. The Wisconsin Supreme Court established its judicial power in the three-branch system soon after Wisconsin became a state by deciding Bashford v. Barstow (1856), an election case that resulted in the ouster of an incumbent governor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/|title=Wisconsin Court System -|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Commencing a civil case==\nCivil cases start the same way regardless of the issues or parties involved and regardless of whether the case ultimately goes to trial. A case begins with pleadings, in which the parties state basic claims and responses. The parties then have an opportunity to investigate the claims and gather evidence through a process called discovery. The court generally has little direct involvement in a case until shortly before trial, though the court is available to resolve preliminary matters and disputes.\n\n===Pleadings===\nThe [[plaintiff]] starts a civil case by filing a summons, and generally a complaint, with the clerk of circuit court and paying a filing fee. A summons provides the defendant notice that a suit has been filed against him or her and notifies the defendant that he or she must answer the complaint. The complaint sets forth the plaintiff's allegations against the defendant. It must contain a short and plain statement of the plaintiff's claim, identify the events out of which the claim arises, and demand relief to satisfy the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff must serve an authenticated copy of the summons and complaint on the defendant. The favored method for serving the defendant is to personally hand a copy of the summons to him or her. Alternatively, the server may hand the summons to another responsible adult at the defendant's residence or, in some cases, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to publish the summons in a newspaper and send it to the defendant's address. Any adult who is not a party to the lawsuit may serve the summons. The person who serves the summons must sign the summons at the time of service and note the date, time, place, and manner of service and upon whom the summons is served. The plaintiff then files proof of service with the court.\n\nA plaintiff must commence a suit by serving the defendant with a summons within a certain time period established by a statute of limitation, or lose the right to sue. Statutes of limitation differ according to the type of suit. For example, a suit for breach of a sales contract must be commenced within six years; a suit for medical malpractice must be commenced within three years of the injury or within one year of discovery of the injury; and a suit to collect child support must be commenced within 20 years after the youngest child for whom support is due turns 18.\n\nThe defendant responds to the plaintiff's allegations in a document called an answer, in which the defendant must admit or deny an allegation or state that he or she does not know if the allegation is true, in which case the allegation is taken as denied. The defendant may also raise affirmative defenses (defenses that defeat the plaintiff's claims even if the plaintiff's allegations are true), for example, that the time period for filing the suit has expired, that the service of the summons and complaint was invalid, or that the complaint has already been settled in previous litigation. The defendant may also file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a fellow defendant.\n\nThe complaint and the answer together constitute the \"pleadings\" in a case. The purpose of the pleadings is to provide notice of the claims and defenses. The issues of the case generally are not narrowed until later in the proceedings.\n\n===Discovery===\nAfter an action is commenced, the parties begin discovery, which is intended to provide the parties mutual knowledge of facts relevant to a case before trial so that the trial is limited to resolving disputed facts and issues. Discovery also allows the parties to formulate and narrow the issues for trial and obtain and preserve evidence. A recipient of a discovery request generally must provide the information or material requested unless it is readily available from another source or is privileged. The scope of permitted discovery in a civil case is quite broad. A party may use discovery to obtain material that will be inadmissible as evidence at trial as long as the material is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Methods of discovery include depositions (recorded interviews with witnesses under oath), interrogatories (written questions), requests for production of documents or things, medical examinations, and requests for admissions.\n\nIdeally and usually, discovery takes place without direct involvement by the court. Except for medical examinations and inspection of medical records, discovery requests need not be authorized by the court. The recipient of a discovery request may seek a protective order denying certain discovery or limiting its scope if the discovery requested will cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or will inquire into privileged or irrelevant matters, and the party requesting discovery may request that the court intervene and order compliance.\n\n===Pretrial activities in court===\nAfter the pleadings are filed, the court may hold a scheduling conference with the parties and issue a scheduling order to manage the progress of the case. The scheduling order generally assigns dates for filing motions, amending pleadings, completing discovery, pretrial conferences between the judge and parties, and for trial. Some judges also use the scheduling conference to advise the parties to attempt to settle the case without going to trial.\n\nIn civil cases, parties often file a variety of pretrial motions with the court seeking court orders affecting the trial. For example, a defendant may seek dismissal of a whole case or certain issues in the case because the plaintiff has not stated a valid claim. Or, a party may seek an order compelling the opposing party to comply with a discovery request or a ruling on admissibility of certain pieces of evidence at trial. If the court requires additional information before ruling on a motion, the court may hold a hearing and may direct the parties to submit briefs, written materials that state the facts and present each side's position.\n\nThe courts resolve motions by order, often directing the prevailing party to prepare the order and submit it to the judge for his or her signature. The resolution of pretrial motions often dictates the future of a case. If a party wins a pretrial motion for summary judgment, the case is dismissed. Sometimes a party who loses important pretrial motions is more likely to agree to a settlement. A settlement must be accepted by a judge. Judges usually accept settlement agreements in civil cases with minimal review, although they look more closely at settlement agreements in divorce cases. If the parties do not settle, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Commencing a criminal case==\nOnly the state may bring a criminal case. Generally a prosecutor starts a criminal case by filing a complaint. The court is directly involved in a criminal case from the beginning to protect the rights of the defendant. Parties have a right to discovery in a criminal case, but discovery is not as extensive in a criminal case as in a civil case because the state must have completed most of its investigation before bringing criminal charges.\n\n===The criminal complaint===\nMost criminal cases are started when a prosecutor, either a [[district attorney]] (who represents a [[County (United States)|county]]) or the [[attorney general]] (who represents the state), files a complaint with the court. The complaint states the crime charged, names the defendant, and gives the date, approximate time, and location of the crime. In a complaint, the district attorney also presents sufficient facts to show why the defendant is being charged, identifies the source of the information contained in the complaint, and provides reasons why the source should be believed.\n\nProsecution of most crimes must be commenced within a certain time period that is established by a statute of limitation. The state generally has six years to commence prosecution of a felony (a crime for which a person may be sentenced to one year or more in prison) and three years for a misdemeanor (a crime for which the maximum penalty is a year in jail). However, there is no time limit for the prosecution of homicide. The main purpose of time limits is to ensure that criminal cases are tried while the evidence is still available and witnesses' memories are fresh. A case is commenced when a warrant, summons, or indictment is issued or an information is filed.\n\n===Pretrial court appearances===\nThe defendant's first court date is called the initial appearance. The court informs the defendant of the charges filed against him or her and gives the defendant a copy of the complaint. The court also informs the defendant of his or her right to have an attorney and that if the defendant is indigent and requests counsel, the court will appoint an attorney. If the defendant is in custody, the court determines whether to release the defendant on [[bail]], and if the defendant is released, imposes conditions for bail. In a misdemeanor case, the court may set the trial date at the initial appearance. The next court action in a misdemeanor case is the arraignment. Further steps are required in a felony case. At the initial appearance, the court informs a felony defendant that he or she is entitled to a preliminary examination before the criminal case may go forward.\n\nThe purpose of a preliminary examination is to determine in a felony case whether the district attorney can show probable cause to believe that the defendant committed a felony. If not, the court must dismiss the felony complaint. At the preliminary examination the district attorney and defendant may call witnesses and present evidence. If the court determines that the district attorney has shown probable cause or if the defendant waives his or her right to a preliminary examination, the case goes forward. The prosecutor files a pleading called an \"information,\" which informs the court of the crime with which the defendant is charged and states the date and place of the crime.\n\nAn arraignment is held in both misdemeanor and felony cases. At the arraignment, the complaint or information is read out loud unless the defendant waives reading, and in a felony case the district attorney gives the defendant a copy of the information. The court then asks the defendant to submit a plea. The defendant may plead \"guilty\", \"no contest\", \"not guilty\", or \"not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect\". A plea of no contest has the same effect in a criminal case as a guilty plea, except it cannot be used as an admission of criminal action in a civil case. The defendant may not enter a plea of no contest without approval from the court. If the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, the court sentences the defendant or places the defendant on probation. If the defendant pleads not guilty or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Grand jury and John Doe proceedings==\nAlthough the vast majority of criminal cases in Wisconsin are begun by a district attorney filing a criminal complaint, some cases are commenced as the result of a [[grand jury]] or [[John Doe]] investigation. Grand jury and John Doe investigations are secret proceedings for which witnesses may be subpoenaed. Grand jury and John Doe proceedings are generally used when investigators need to take testimony under oath or compel a witness to testify in order to gather sufficient evidence to issue a criminal complaint.\n\nA judge, usually upon the request of a district attorney, may assemble a grand jury to investigate suspected criminal activity. A grand jury consists of 17 people selected for jury service. The grand jury may request that the prosecutor [[subpoena]] and examine witnesses. Upon completing an investigation, a grand jury may by the vote of at least 14 members return an indictment, which is a written accusation that a person committed a crime. If the grand jury returns an indictment, the court issues a summons or warrant for the defendant.\n\nA judge initiates a John Doe proceeding upon receiving a complaint about criminal activity from any person, including the district attorney. The judge must question the person who makes the complaint under oath and may subpoena and examine other witnesses (usually with the assistance of the district attorney). If the judge finds probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime, a written complaint is filed and the judge issues a warrant for the arrest of the defendant named in the complaint.\n\n===Discovery===\nDiscovery in a criminal case is generally less extensive than in a civil case. Discovery allows the parties to obtain certain information known by the opposing party. Upon request, the prosecution and defense must provide a list of witnesses it intends to call at trial, as well as statements of the witnesses, reports of expert witnesses, and any known criminal record of a witness. The parties must also disclose any physical evidence they intend to introduce at trial. A party may obtain a court order allowing scientific testing of evidence held by the opposing party. The prosecution must disclose statements made by the defendant that pertain to the crime or that the prosecution intends to introduce at trial. The prosecution is obligated to disclose exculpatory evidence (evidence that might weigh in the defendant's favor) to the defendant even if the defendant does not specifically request the information or material.\n\n===Pretrial motions and plea bargains===\nParties in a criminal case often file [[pretrial motion]]s. Common motions include motions to exclude physical evidence, a defendant's confession, or an [[eyewitness identification]] of the defendant. The court may require the attorneys to submit briefs on the motions, but briefing is less common on pretrial motions in criminal cases than civil cases.\n\nMost criminal cases do not go to trial. Instead the prosecution and defense negotiate a settlement. The parties may agree upon the crimes to which a defendant will plead guilty and a sentence recommendation, or may only agree on the plea. The judge must review the agreement on the plea before accepting it to ensure that there is sufficient reason to believe that the defendant is guilty of the crime. If the parties agree on a sentence recommendation, the judge must review it to determine if it is appropriate. The judge is not bound by the sentence agreement.\n\n==Trial of a civil or criminal case==\nThe proceedings in a trial of a civil or criminal case are similar. Both may be to a jury or judge. Both start with opening statements, proceed to presentation of evidence followed by closing statements, and culminate with a decision. Depending on the result of the trial, a civil case may end with the awarding of damages and a criminal trial may end with sentencing. During the trial, the role of the judge is similar \u2013 determining the admissibility of evidence, guiding the jury, if there is one, and refereeing the actions of the attorneys.\n\n==Current Judges==\n\nCircuit judges are elected to a six year term in the spring non-partisan election, currently Wisconsin holds a non-partisan primary election in February and a general election in April.  New judicial terms start on the first day of August in the year of the election.\n\nIn the event of a vacancy, the Governor can appoint an interim judge to hold office until the next spring election.\n\n===District 1===\n\n*'''Counties:''' [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]\n*'''Court:''' [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]\n*'''Chief Judge:''' Mary Triggiano \n*'''Court Administrator:''' Holly Szablewski<ref name=\"bb2019\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Circuit\n!Branch\n!Judge\n!Entered office\n!Next election\n!Notes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"47\"| [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]\n| 1\n| Jack D\u00e1vila\n| align=\"center\" | 2020\n| align=\"center\" | 2021\n| ''Appointed by [[Tony Evers]]''<ref name=\"evers\">{{cite news| url= https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/09/jack-davila-named-circuit-judge-milwaukee-county/5126764002/ |title= Gov.

There are currently 69 circuits in the state, divided into 10 judicial administrative districts. Circuit court judges hear and decide both civil and criminal cases. Each of the 249 circuit court judges are elected and serve six-year terms.<ref name=\"bb2019\">{{cite report| url= https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/misc/lrb/blue_book/2019_2020 |title= Wisconsin Blue Book 2019-2020 |year= 2019|publisher= State of Wisconsin |location= [[Madison, Wisconsin]] |chapter= The Judiciary |pages= 268-271 |accessdate= January 1, 2020}}</ref>  \n\nOn March 6, 2020, Governor [[Tony Evers]] signed bipartisan legislation to create 12 new circuit court branches to be elected in spring 2021 and take office in fall 2021.<ref>{{cite news|url= https://madison.com/wsj/news/local/govt-and-politics/tony-evers-signs-bill-adding-circuit-court-branches/article_f8fcfe31-c419-5ef3-8da2-29a1c7f84750.html|title= Tony Evers signs bill adding 12 circuit court branches  |newspaper= [[Wisconsin State Journal]] |first= Riley |last= Vetterkind |date= March 6, 2020 |accessdate= March 6, 2020 }}</ref>\n\n==Structure of the circuit courts==\nThe circuit court system is composed of 69 circuits, with 66 circuits serving a single county, and three circuits serving two counties each.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://wicourts.gov/courts/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit courts|website=wicourts.gov}}</ref> [[Buffalo County, Wisconsin|Buffalo]] and [[Pepin County, Wisconsin|Pepin]]<nowiki/> counties share a circuit, as do [[Florence County, Wisconsin|Florence]] and [[Forest County, Wisconsin|Forest]] counties, and [[Shawano County, Wisconsin|Shawano]] and [[Menominee County, Wisconsin|Menominee]] counties.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> 26 circuit courts are served by a single judge.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> For those circuits with more than one judge, each is elected to a particular seat, or \"branch\" within the court. The [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee County]] Circuit Court has the greatest number of branches with 47.\n\nThe circuit courts are organized into 10 geographical administrative districts. Within each district the [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] will appoint a chief judge, a deputy chief judge, and a professional district court administrator.<ref name=\"wicourts.gov\"/> With the exception of Milwaukee County, chief judges and their deputies continue to hear cases while serving. Chief judges assign judges to hear only a specific type of case (e.g. civil, criminal, juvenile), equalize the flow of cases, establish court policies and rules, and supervise the finances of the courts they administer. They also work closely with county boards on security, facility, and staffing issues. The chief judges and district court administration meet regularly with the director of state courts to discuss current issues and to advise the Supreme court and the director on matters of statewide concern.\n\nIn 2017, Wisconsin's Supreme Court created a new [[Business courts|Business Court]], the Commercial Docket Pilot Project,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/services/attorney/comcourtpilot.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Commercial Docket Pilot Project|website=www.wicourts.gov|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> located in the Waukesha County Circuit Court and the Eighth Judicial Administrative District.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wisbar.org/NewsPublications/WisconsinLawyer/Pages/Article.aspx?Volume=91&Issue=1&ArticleID=26094|title=Solutions The Need for Speed: Commercial Court Open for Business|website=WisBar|language=en-us|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref> On April 1, 2019, the Supreme Court expanded the Commercial Docket's geographic jurisdiction to encompass the entire state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesscourtsblog.com/wisconsin-expands-the-commercial-docket-pilot-project-to-all-wisconsin-counties/|title=Wisconsin Expands the Commercial Docket Pilot Project to All Wisconsin Counties \u2013 Business Courts Blog|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-06}}</ref>\n\n==Jurisdiction==\nThe Wisconsin circuit courts have original jurisdiction to hear all civil and criminal matters within the state. The court's jurisdiction is conferred by Article VII, Section 8 of the [[Wisconsin Constitution]] and is quite broad. Since the court's subject matter jurisdiction is constitutional rather than statutory, the [[Wisconsin Legislature]] cannot limit it by statute. By comparison, the [[United States Congress]] is empowered to limit the subject matter jurisdiction of federal [[United States district court|District Courts]] if it so chooses.\n\nThe geographic limitations of the circuit court's authority are referred to as \"[[personal jurisdiction]].\" In a [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] case, the requirements for personal jurisdiction are governed by chapter 801.05 of the Wisconsin Statutes. Generally speaking, a defendant must either be present in the state, or have sufficient contacts with the state, and the pleadings must have been properly served on the defendant. Personal jurisdiction requirements in a civil case are driven by policy considerations, such as fairness to the defendant, [[comity]], and principals of [[Federalism in the United States|federalism]].\n\nThe circuit court has personal jurisdiction over a defendant in a criminal case if the defendant violates a Wisconsin law while physically present in Wisconsin. Wisconsin courts also have personal jurisdiction over a defendant who commits an act while out of state that contributes to a crime, the consequences of which occur in Wisconsin.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/forms1/circuit/index.htm|title=Wisconsin Court System - Circuit court forms|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n\n==Limits on exercise of power to decide cases==\nThere are, however, limits on what cases the circuit courts will hear.  They will not hear a case if the parties lack standing, or if the case is moot or is not ripe. Additionally, the circuit court will not hear a case in which it lacks competency. State law distinguishes between the court's jurisdiction (power to hear a case) and its competency (ability to arrive at a valid judgment in a case). A court lacks competency if certain statutory requirements are not satisfied, for example, time limits for filing suit, or requirements as to which circuit should decide a case.\n\nIn addition, the courts are constrained from taking action that will encroach on the powers of the legislative or executive branches. Under the separation of powers doctrine, no branch of government may exercise a power of government assigned exclusively to another branch. The purpose of separating powers among the branches of government is to avoid concentration of governmental power in the hands of a new and to give the various branches the ability to check actions by the other branches.\n\nIn reviewing the validity of state laws, the courts are limited to determining whether the law violates any provision of the constitution. The courts may invalidate a law that violates individual rights, such as the right to equal protection or due process, or a law that is not enacted according to the process established in the constitution, for example, a bill that was not passed by a majority of the members of each house of the [[Wisconsin State Legislature]]. However, a court may not invalidate a law because the court finds that the legislature's method for addressing a problem was not the most efficient. Nor may the court substitute its determination of what is in the public interest for the determination of the legislature.\n\nWhile the separation of powers doctrine limits the ability of the courts to act, it also protects the courts from encroachment by the legislature of governor. The Wisconsin Supreme Court established its judicial power in the three-branch system soon after Wisconsin became a state by deciding Bashford v. Barstow (1856), an election case that resulted in the ouster of an incumbent governor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wicourts.gov/|title=Wisconsin Court System -|website=www.wicourts.gov}}</ref>\n\n==Commencing a civil case==\nCivil cases start the same way regardless of the issues or parties involved and regardless of whether the case ultimately goes to trial. A case begins with pleadings, in which the parties state basic claims and responses. The parties then have an opportunity to investigate the claims and gather evidence through a process called discovery. The court generally has little direct involvement in a case until shortly before trial, though the court is available to resolve preliminary matters and disputes.\n\n===Pleadings===\nThe [[plaintiff]] starts a civil case by filing a summons, and generally a complaint, with the clerk of circuit court and paying a filing fee. A summons provides the defendant notice that a suit has been filed against him or her and notifies the defendant that he or she must answer the complaint. The complaint sets forth the plaintiff's allegations against the defendant. It must contain a short and plain statement of the plaintiff's claim, identify the events out of which the claim arises, and demand relief to satisfy the plaintiff's claim. The plaintiff must serve an authenticated copy of the summons and complaint on the defendant. The favored method for serving the defendant is to personally hand a copy of the summons to him or her. Alternatively, the server may hand the summons to another responsible adult at the defendant's residence or, in some cases, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to publish the summons in a newspaper and send it to the defendant's address. Any adult who is not a party to the lawsuit may serve the summons. The person who serves the summons must sign the summons at the time of service and note the date, time, place, and manner of service and upon whom the summons is served. The plaintiff then files proof of service with the court.\n\nA plaintiff must commence a suit by serving the defendant with a summons within a certain time period established by a statute of limitation, or lose the right to sue. Statutes of limitation differ according to the type of suit. For example, a suit for breach of a sales contract must be commenced within six years; a suit for medical malpractice must be commenced within three years of the injury or within one year of discovery of the injury; and a suit to collect child support must be commenced within 20 years after the youngest child for whom support is due turns 18.\n\nThe defendant responds to the plaintiff's allegations in a document called an answer, in which the defendant must admit or deny an allegation or state that he or she does not know if the allegation is true, in which case the allegation is taken as denied. The defendant may also raise affirmative defenses (defenses that defeat the plaintiff's claims even if the plaintiff's allegations are true), for example, that the time period for filing the suit has expired, that the service of the summons and complaint was invalid, or that the complaint has already been settled in previous litigation. The defendant may also file a counterclaim against the plaintiff, or a cross-claim against a fellow defendant.\n\nThe complaint and the answer together constitute the \"pleadings\" in a case. The purpose of the pleadings is to provide notice of the claims and defenses. The issues of the case generally are not narrowed until later in the proceedings.\n\n===Discovery===\nAfter an action is commenced, the parties begin discovery, which is intended to provide the parties mutual knowledge of facts relevant to a case before trial so that the trial is limited to resolving disputed facts and issues. Discovery also allows the parties to formulate and narrow the issues for trial and obtain and preserve evidence. A recipient of a discovery request generally must provide the information or material requested unless it is readily available from another source or is privileged. The scope of permitted discovery in a civil case is quite broad. A party may use discovery to obtain material that will be inadmissible as evidence at trial as long as the material is reasonably calculated to lead to admissible evidence. Methods of discovery include depositions (recorded interviews with witnesses under oath), interrogatories (written questions), requests for production of documents or things, medical examinations, and requests for admissions.\n\nIdeally and usually, discovery takes place without direct involvement by the court. Except for medical examinations and inspection of medical records, discovery requests need not be authorized by the court. The recipient of a discovery request may seek a protective order denying certain discovery or limiting its scope if the discovery requested will cause annoyance, embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense, or will inquire into privileged or irrelevant matters, and the party requesting discovery may request that the court intervene and order compliance.\n\n===Pretrial activities in court===\nAfter the pleadings are filed, the court may hold a scheduling conference with the parties and issue a scheduling order to manage the progress of the case. The scheduling order generally assigns dates for filing motions, amending pleadings, completing discovery, pretrial conferences between the judge and parties, and for trial. Some judges also use the scheduling conference to advise the parties to attempt to settle the case without going to trial.\n\nIn civil cases, parties often file a variety of pretrial motions with the court seeking court orders affecting the trial. For example, a defendant may seek dismissal of a whole case or certain issues in the case because the plaintiff has not stated a valid claim. Or, a party may seek an order compelling the opposing party to comply with a discovery request or a ruling on admissibility of certain pieces of evidence at trial. If the court requires additional information before ruling on a motion, the court may hold a hearing and may direct the parties to submit briefs, written materials that state the facts and present each side's position.\n\nThe courts resolve motions by order, often directing the prevailing party to prepare the order and submit it to the judge for his or her signature. The resolution of pretrial motions often dictates the future of a case. If a party wins a pretrial motion for summary judgment, the case is dismissed. Sometimes a party who loses important pretrial motions is more likely to agree to a settlement. A settlement must be accepted by a judge. Judges usually accept settlement agreements in civil cases with minimal review, although they look more closely at settlement agreements in divorce cases. If the parties do not settle, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Commencing a criminal case==\nOnly the state may bring a criminal case. Generally a prosecutor starts a criminal case by filing a complaint. The court is directly involved in a criminal case from the beginning to protect the rights of the defendant. Parties have a right to discovery in a criminal case, but discovery is not as extensive in a criminal case as in a civil case because the state must have completed most of its investigation before bringing criminal charges.\n\n===The criminal complaint===\nMost criminal cases are started when a prosecutor, either a [[district attorney]] (who represents a [[County (United States)|county]]) or the [[attorney general]] (who represents the state), files a complaint with the court. The complaint states the crime charged, names the defendant, and gives the date, approximate time, and location of the crime. In a complaint, the district attorney also presents sufficient facts to show why the defendant is being charged, identifies the source of the information contained in the complaint, and provides reasons why the source should be believed.\n\nProsecution of most crimes must be commenced within a certain time period that is established by a statute of limitation. The state generally has six years to commence prosecution of a felony (a crime for which a person may be sentenced to one year or more in prison) and three years for a misdemeanor (a crime for which the maximum penalty is a year in jail). However, there is no time limit for the prosecution of homicide. The main purpose of time limits is to ensure that criminal cases are tried while the evidence is still available and witnesses' memories are fresh. A case is commenced when a warrant, summons, or indictment is issued or an information is filed.\n\n===Pretrial court appearances===\nThe defendant's first court date is called the initial appearance. The court informs the defendant of the charges filed against him or her and gives the defendant a copy of the complaint. The court also informs the defendant of his or her right to have an attorney and that if the defendant is indigent and requests counsel, the court will appoint an attorney. If the defendant is in custody, the court determines whether to release the defendant on [[bail]], and if the defendant is released, imposes conditions for bail. In a misdemeanor case, the court may set the trial date at the initial appearance. The next court action in a misdemeanor case is the arraignment. Further steps are required in a felony case. At the initial appearance, the court informs a felony defendant that he or she is entitled to a preliminary examination before the criminal case may go forward.\n\nThe purpose of a preliminary examination is to determine in a felony case whether the district attorney can show probable cause to believe that the defendant committed a felony. If not, the court must dismiss the felony complaint. At the preliminary examination the district attorney and defendant may call witnesses and present evidence. If the court determines that the district attorney has shown probable cause or if the defendant waives his or her right to a preliminary examination, the case goes forward. The prosecutor files a pleading called an \"information,\" which informs the court of the crime with which the defendant is charged and states the date and place of the crime.\n\nAn arraignment is held in both misdemeanor and felony cases. At the arraignment, the complaint or information is read out loud unless the defendant waives reading, and in a felony case the district attorney gives the defendant a copy of the information. The court then asks the defendant to submit a plea. The defendant may plead \"guilty\", \"no contest\", \"not guilty\", or \"not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect\". A plea of no contest has the same effect in a criminal case as a guilty plea, except it cannot be used as an admission of criminal action in a civil case. The defendant may not enter a plea of no contest without approval from the court. If the defendant pleads guilty or no contest, the court sentences the defendant or places the defendant on probation. If the defendant pleads not guilty or not guilty by reason of mental disease or defect, the case proceeds to trial.\n\n==Grand jury and John Doe proceedings==\nAlthough the vast majority of criminal cases in Wisconsin are begun by a district attorney filing a criminal complaint, some cases are commenced as the result of a [[grand jury]] or [[John Doe]] investigation. Grand jury and John Doe investigations are secret proceedings for which witnesses may be subpoenaed. Grand jury and John Doe proceedings are generally used when investigators need to take testimony under oath or compel a witness to testify in order to gather sufficient evidence to issue a criminal complaint.\n\nA judge, usually upon the request of a district attorney, may assemble a grand jury to investigate suspected criminal activity. A grand jury consists of 17 people selected for jury service. The grand jury may request that the prosecutor [[subpoena]] and examine witnesses. Upon completing an investigation, a grand jury may by the vote of at least 14 members return an indictment, which is a written accusation that a person committed a crime. If the grand jury returns an indictment, the court issues a summons or warrant for the defendant.\n\nA judge initiates a John Doe proceeding upon receiving a complaint about criminal activity from any person, including the district attorney. The judge must question the person who makes the complaint under oath and may subpoena and examine other witnesses (usually with the assistance of the district attorney). If the judge finds probable cause to believe that a person has committed a crime, a written complaint is filed and the judge issues a warrant for the arrest of the defendant named in the complaint.\n\n===Discovery===\nDiscovery in a criminal case is generally less extensive than in a civil case. Discovery allows the parties to obtain certain information known by the opposing party. Upon request, the prosecution and defense must provide a list of witnesses it intends to call at trial, as well as statements of the witnesses, reports of expert witnesses, and any known criminal record of a witness. The parties must also disclose any physical evidence they intend to introduce at trial. A party may obtain a court order allowing scientific testing of evidence held by the opposing party. The prosecution must disclose statements made by the defendant that pertain to the crime or that the prosecution intends to introduce at trial. The prosecution is obligated to disclose exculpatory evidence (evidence that might weigh in the defendant's favor) to the defendant even if the defendant does not specifically request the information or material.\n\n===Pretrial motions and plea bargains===\nParties in a criminal case often file [[pretrial motion]]s. Common motions include motions to exclude physical evidence, a defendant's confession, or an [[eyewitness identification]] of the defendant. The court may require the attorneys to submit briefs on the motions, but briefing is less common on pretrial motions in criminal cases than civil cases.\n\nMost criminal cases do not go to trial. Instead the prosecution and defense negotiate a settlement. The parties may agree upon the crimes to which a defendant will plead guilty and a sentence recommendation, or may only agree on the plea. The judge must review the agreement on the plea before accepting it to ensure that there is sufficient reason to believe that the defendant is guilty of the crime. If the parties agree on a sentence recommendation, the judge must review it to determine if it is appropriate. The judge is not bound by the sentence agreement.\n\n==Trial of a civil or criminal case==\nThe proceedings in a trial of a civil or criminal case are similar. Both may be to a jury or judge. Both start with opening statements, proceed to presentation of evidence followed by closing statements, and culminate with a decision. Depending on the result of the trial, a civil case may end with the awarding of damages and a criminal trial may end with sentencing. During the trial, the role of the judge is similar \u2013 determining the admissibility of evidence, guiding the jury, if there is one, and refereeing the actions of the attorneys.\n\n==Current Judges==\n\nCircuit judges are elected to a six year term in the spring non-partisan election, currently Wisconsin holds a non-partisan primary election in February and a general election in April.  New judicial terms start on the first day of August in the year of the election.\n\nIn the event of a vacancy, the Governor can appoint an interim judge to hold office until the next spring election.\n\n===District 1===\n\n*'''Counties:''' [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]\n*'''Court:''' [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]]\n*'''Chief Judge:''' Mary Triggiano \n*'''Court Administrator:''' Holly Szablewski<ref name=\"bb2019\"/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Circuit\n!Branch\n!Judge\n!Entered office\n!Next election\n!Notes\n|-\n! rowspan=\"47\"| [[Milwaukee County, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]\n| 1\n| Jack D\u00e1vila\n| align=\"center\" | 2020\n| align=\"center\" | 2021\n| ''Appointed by [[Tony Evers]]''<ref name=\"evers\">{{cite news| url= https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2020/04/09/jack-davila-named-circuit-judge-milwaukee-county/5126764002/ |title= Gov.

After the third book's publication, the authors talked with every cable network that had expressed interest. FX was deemed most suitable because they wanted to follow the books closely and liked the idea of ''The Strain'' as a close-ended series consisting of three to five seasons. Del Toro stated that the first two novels can be covered by one season each, while ''The Night Eternal'' may be split into two or three seasons. The author is also open to creative detours that may develop as the series goes on, possibly incorporating material cut from the books. Del Toro intends to direct as many episodes as his busy schedule allows.<ref name=\"Deadline\"/> Before the series order was announced, FX gave the writing team the go-ahead to script another ten episodes, which del Toro rewrote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/174729-exclusive-guillermo-del-toro-on-the-televised-horrors-of-the-strain-fx-orders-scripts-for-entire-season|title=Exclusive: Guillermo del Toro on the Televised Horrors of ''The Strain'', FX Orders Scripts for Entire Season|last=Turek|first=Ryan|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=June 30, 2013|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> FX president [[John Landgraf]] has stated that the series will consist of \"39\u201365 episodes, no less, no more\", adding \"What if a television show could be just the length that is optimal for that story?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/08/tca-fxs-john-landgraf-signals-end-of-nuclear-arms-race-of-darkness-talks-the-strain-game-plan-fx-brand-expansion/|title=TCA: FX's John Landgraf Signals End Of 'Nuclear Arms Race Of Darkness', Talks ''The Strain'' Game Plan, FX Brand Expansion|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|publisher=Deadline.com|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the style of the show's production, del Toro stated: \"Basically I'm trying to do what I do in my movies which is to show it as a reality, but as a reality that is stylized. It's not like ''CSI'' or ''[[The Wire]]'', it's real but it feels a little stylized. But the way the camera work will be is very realistic. We want to keep the camera very documentary even if the look of the show is not. The look of the show is very designed. The style of the camera and the storytelling will be very loose. It will evolve from that feel of reality, and little by little we want to evolve into more stylish, horror feel that requires smoother camera moves, more suspense and atmosphere-driven moments so it will be a mixture.

After the third book's publication, the authors talked with every cable network that had expressed interest. FX was deemed most suitable because they wanted to follow the books closely and liked the idea of ''The Strain'' as a close-ended series consisting of three to five seasons. Del Toro stated that the first two novels can be covered by one season each, while ''The Night Eternal'' may be split into two or three seasons. The author is also open to creative detours that may develop as the series goes on, possibly incorporating material cut from the books. Del Toro intends to direct as many episodes as his busy schedule allows.<ref name=\"Deadline\"/> Before the series order was announced, FX gave the writing team the go-ahead to script another ten episodes, which del Toro rewrote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/174729-exclusive-guillermo-del-toro-on-the-televised-horrors-of-the-strain-fx-orders-scripts-for-entire-season|title=Exclusive: Guillermo del Toro on the Televised Horrors of ''The Strain'', FX Orders Scripts for Entire Season|last=Turek|first=Ryan|publisher=Shock Till You Drop|date=June 30, 2013|accessdate=June 30, 2013}}</ref> FX president [[John Landgraf]] has stated that the series will consist of \"39\u201365 episodes, no less, no more\", adding \"What if a television show could be just the length that is optimal for that story?\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/08/tca-fxs-john-landgraf-signals-end-of-nuclear-arms-race-of-darkness-talks-the-strain-game-plan-fx-brand-expansion/|title=TCA: FX's John Landgraf Signals End Of 'Nuclear Arms Race Of Darkness', Talks ''The Strain'' Game Plan, FX Brand Expansion|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|publisher=Deadline.com|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2013}}</ref>\n\nRegarding the style of the show's production, del Toro stated: \"Basically I'm trying to do what I do in my movies which is to show it as a reality, but as a reality that is stylized. It's not like ''CSI'' or ''[[The Wire]]'', it's real but it feels a little stylized. But the way the camera work will be is very realistic. We want to keep the camera very documentary even if the look of the show is not. The look of the show is very designed. The style of the camera and the storytelling will be very loose. It will evolve from that feel of reality, and little by little we want to evolve into more stylish, horror feel that requires smoother camera moves, more suspense and atmosphere-driven moments so it will be a mixture.
