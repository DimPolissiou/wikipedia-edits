{"title_page": "History of Ethiopia", "text_new": "{{short description|Aspect of history}}\n{{pp-move-indef}}\n{{History of Ethiopia}}\nThe article covers the [[prehistory]] and [[history]] of [[Ethiopia]] from its emergence as an empire under the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumites]] to its current form as the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia as well as the history of other areas in what is now Ethiopia such as the [[Afar Triangle]]. The [[Ethiopian Empire]] (Abyssinia) was first founded by Ethiopian people in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. Due to migration and imperial expansion, it grew to include many other primarily [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]-speaking communities, including [[Oromo people|Oromos]], [[Amhara people|Amhara]], [[Somali people|Somalis]], [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigray]], [[Afar people|Afars]], [[Sidama people|Sidama]], [[Gurage people|Gurage]], [[Agaw people|Agaw]] and [[Harari people|Harari]], among others.\n\nOne of the early kingdoms to rise to power in the territory was the kingdom of [[D'mt]] in the 10th century BC, which established its capital at [[Yeha]]. In the first century AD the [[Aksumite Kingdom]] rose to power in the [[Tigray Region]] with its capital at [[Aksum]] and grew into a major power on the [[Red Sea]], subjugating [[Yemen]] and [[Meroe]] and converting to [[Christianity]] in the early fourth century. The Aksumite empire fell into decline with the rise of [[Islam]] in the Arabian peninsula, which slowly shifted trade away from the Christian Aksum. It eventually became isolated, then economy slumped and Aksum's commercial domination of the region was over.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ethiopian History |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref> The Aksumites gave way to the [[Zagwe Dynasty]], who established a new capital at [[Lalibela]] before giving way to the [[Solomonic Dynasty]] in the 13th century. During the early Solomonic period, Ethiopia went through military reforms and imperial expansion that made it dominate the [[Horn of Africa]]. Portuguese missionaries arrived at this time.\n\nIn 1529, the [[Adal Sultanate]] [[Abyssinian\u2013Adal war|attempted to conquer Abyssinia]] and met initial success; the Adal were supplied by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s while Abyssinia received [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] reinforcements. By 1543, Abyssinia had recaptured lost territory but the war had weakened both sides. The [[Oromo people]] were able to expand into the highlands, conquering both the Adal Sultanate and Abyssinia. The Portuguese presence also increased, while the Ottomans began to push into what is now [[Eritrea]], creating the [[Habesh Eyalet]]. The Portuguese brought modern weapons and [[baroque architecture]] to Ethiopia, and in 1622 converted the emperor [[Susenyos I]] to Catholicism, sparking a civil war which ended in his abdication and expulsion of all Catholics from Ethiopia. A new capital was established at [[Gondar]] in 1632, and a period of peace and prosperity ensued until the country was split apart by warlords in the 18th century during the [[Zemene Mesafint]].\n\nEthiopia was reunified in 1855 under [[Tewodros II]], beginning [[Ethiopian historiography|Ethiopia's modern history]] and his reign was followed by [[Yohannes IV]] who was killed in action in 1889. Under [[Menelik II]] Ethiopia started its transformation to well organized technological advancement and the structure that the country has now. [[Ethiopia]] also expanded to the south and east, through the conquest of the western Oromo (now Shoan Oromo), [[Sidama Zone|Sidama]], [[Gurage Zone|Gurage]], Wolayta and other groups, resulting in the borders of modern Ethiopia. Ethiopia defeated an [[Ethiopian\u2013Egyptian War|Egyptian invasion in 1876]] and an [[First Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion in 1896]] which killed 17,000 Ethiopians,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Etemad |first1=Bouda |title=Possessing the World: Taking the Measurements of Colonisation from the 18th to the 20th Century |date=2007 |page=87}}</ref> and came to be recognised as a legitimate state by European powers. A more rapid modernisation took place under Menelik II and [[Haile Selassie]]. Italy launched a second invasion [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|in 1935]]. From 1935\u20131941, Ethiopia was under [[Italian Ethiopia|Italian occupation]] as part of [[Italian East Africa]]. A joint force of British and Ethiopian rebels managed to drive the Italians out of the country in 1941, and Haile Selassie was returned to the throne. Ethiopia and Eritrea united in a federation, but when Haile Selassie ended the federation in 1961 and made Eritrea a province of Ethiopia, the 30-year [[Eritrean War of Independence]] broke out. Eritrea regained its independence after a referendum in 1993.\n\nHaile Selassie was overthrown in 1974 and the militaristic [[Derg]] Regime came to power. In 1977 [[Somalia]] [[Ogaden War|invaded]], trying to [[Greater Somalia|annex]] the [[Ogaden region]], but were pushed back by Ethiopian, Soviet, and Cuban forces. In 1977 and 1978 the government tortured or killed hundreds of thousands of suspected enemies in the [[Red Terror (Ethiopia)|Red Terror]]. Ethiopia experienced [[1983\u20131985 famine in Ethiopia|famine in 1984]] that killed one million people and [[Ethiopian Civil War|civil war]] that resulted in the fall of the Derg in 1991. This resulted in the establishment of the Federal Democratic Republic under [[Meles Zenawi]]. Ethiopia remains impoverished, but its economy has become one of the world's fastest-growing.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15739706 | work=BBC News | title=Ethiopia: One of the world's fastest growing economies | date=15 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Timeline==\n{{further|Ethiopian historiography}}\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:1080 height:75\nPlotArea = width:1000 height:55 left:10 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\nColors = \n    id:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) # \n    id:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) # \n    id:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) # \n    id:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) # \n    id:eon value:rgb(1,0.85,0.7) # \n    id:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n    id:black value:blue\n\nPeriod     = from:0 till:1632\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:100 start:0\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:10 start:0\n\nPlotData =\n  align:center textcolor:black fontsize:9 mark:(line,black) width:11 shift:(0,15)\n  bar:Periods color:period\n  from:0 till:960 text:[[Aksumite Empire|Aksumite]]\n  from:960 till:1137 text:[[Gudit|Post-Aksumite]]\n  from:1137 till:1270 text:[[Zagwe Dynasty|Zagwe]]\n  from:1270 till:1632 text:[[Early Solomonic Period|Early Solomonic]]\n</timeline>\n\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:1080 height:75\nPlotArea = width:1000 height:55 left:10 bottom:20\nAlignBars = justify\nColors = \n    id:time value:rgb(0.7,0.7,1) # \n    id:period value:rgb(1,0.7,0.5) # \n    id:age value:rgb(0.95,0.85,0.5) # \n    id:era value:rgb(1,0.85,0.5) # \n    id:eon value:rgb(1,0.85,0.7) # \n    id:filler value:gray(0.8) # background bar\n    id:black value:black\n\nPeriod     = from:1632 till:2013\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:25 start:1650\nScaleMinor = unit:year increment:5 start:1635\n\nPlotData =\n  align:center textcolor:black fontsize:9 mark:(line,black) width:11 shift:(0,15)\n  bar:Periods color:period\n  from:1632 till:1706 text:[[Gondar|Early Gondarine]]\n  from:1706 till:1855 text:[[Zemene Mesafint]]\n  from:1855 till:1936 text:[[Tewodros II|Reunification]]\n  from:1936 till:1941 text:[[Italian East Africa|Italian]]\n  from:1941 till:1974 text:[[Haile Selassie|Selassie Era]]\n  from:1974 till:1991 text:[[Derg]]\n  from:1991 till:2013 text:[[Ethiopia|Federal]]\n</timeline>\n\n==Prehistory==\nIt was not until 1963 that evidence of the presence of ancient [[hominids]] was discovered in Ethiopia, many years after similar discoveries had been made in neighbouring [[Kenya]] and [[Tanzania]].

Earlier inscription of [[Ezana of Aksum|Ezana]] ''Habashat'' (the source for \"Abyssinia\") in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], [[South Arabian alphabet]], was then translated in [[Greek language|Greek]] as  \"Aethiopia\".\n\nThe state of [[Sheba]] which is mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] is sometimes believed to have been in Ethiopia, but it is more often placed in [[Yemen]]. According to the Ethiopian narrative, best represented in the ''[[Kebra Nagast]]'', the [[Queen of Sheba]] slept with [[King Solomon]] and bore a child named Ebn Melek (later Emperor [[Menelik I]]). When he was of age, Menelik returned to [[Israel]] to see his father, who sent with him the son of [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]] to accompany him with a replica of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] (Ethiosemitic: ''[[tabot]]''). On his return with some of the [[Israelites|Israelite]] [[Priesthood (ancient Israel)|priests]], however, he found that Zadok's son had stolen the real Ark of the Covenant. Some believe the Ark is still being preserved today at the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in Axum, Ethiopia.  The tradition that the biblical Queen of Sheba was a ruler of Ethiopia who visited King Solomon in [[Jerusalem]] in [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel]] is supported by the 1st century AD Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]], who identified Solomon's visitor as a queen of Egypt and Ethiopia.\n\n===D\u02bfmt===\n{{main|D\u02bfmt}}\n[[File:Yeha Tigray Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Temple at [[Yeha]], possible capital of [[D'mt]].]]\nThe first kingdom known to have existed in Ethiopia was the kingdom of D'mt, with its capital at [[Yeha]], where a [[Sabaean]] style temple was built around 700 BC. It rose to power around the 10th century BC. The D'mt kingdom was influenced by the Sabaeans in Yemen, however it is not known to what extent. While it was once believed that D'mt was a Sabaean colony, it is now believed that Sabaean influence was minor, limited to a few localities, and disappeared after a few decades or a century, perhaps representing a trading or military colony in some sort of symbiosis or military alliance with the civilization of D\u02bfmt or some other proto-Aksumite state.<ref>Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 57.</ref><ref>Phillipson. \"''The First Millennium BC in the Highlands of Northern Ethiopia and South\u2013Central Eritrea: A Reassessment of Cultural and Political Development\".

As a result, it is not known whether D\u02bfmt ended as a civilization before [[Aksum]]'s early stages, evolved into the Aksumite state, or was one of the smaller states united in the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite kingdom]] possibly around the beginning of the 1st century.<ref>Uhlig, Siegbert (ed.), ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005. p. 185.</ref>\n\n===Axum===\n{{main|Kingdom of Aksum}}\n[[File:Stela aksum.jpg|thumb|upright|[[King Ezana's Stele]] in Aksum.]]\nThe first verifiable kingdom of great power to rise in Ethiopia was that of Axum in the 1st century AD. It was one of many successor kingdoms to [[D\u02bfmt]] and was able to unite the northern [[Ethiopian Highlands]] beginning around the 1st century BC. They established bases on the northern highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau and from there expanded southward. The [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]]n religious figure [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] listed Axum with [[Roman Empire|Rome]], Persia, and [[China]] as one of the four great powers of his time. The origins of the Axumite Kingdom are unclear, although experts have offered their speculations about it. Even who should be considered the earliest known king is contested: although [[Carlo Conti Rossini]] proposed that [[Zoskales]] of Axum, mentioned in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', should be identified with one Za Haqle mentioned in the Ethiopian King Lists (a view embraced by [[Ethiopian historiography|later historians of Ethiopia]] such as Yuri M. Kobishchanov<ref>Yuri M. Kobishchanov, ''Axum'', Joseph W. Michels, editor; Lorraine T. Kapitanoff, translator, (University Park, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania, 1979), pp.54\u201359.</ref> and Sergew Hable Sellasie), [[G.W.B. Huntingford]] argued that Zoskales was only a sub-king whose authority was limited to [[Adulis]], and that Conti Rossini's identification can not be substantiated.<ref>Expressed, for example, in his ''The Historical Geography of Ethiopia'' (London: the British Academy, 1989), p.39.</ref>\n\nInscriptions have been found in southern [[Arabia]] celebrating victories over one [[GDRT]], described as \"''nagashi'' of [[Habesha people|Habashat]] [i.e. Abyssinia] and of Axum.\" Other dated inscriptions are used to determine a ''floruit'' for GDRT (interpreted as representing a Ge'ez name such as Gadarat, Gedur, Gadurat or Gedara) around the beginning of the 3rd century. A bronze scepter or wand has been discovered at Atsbi Dera with an inscription mentioning \"GDR of Axum\". Coins showing the royal portrait began to be minted under King [[Endubis]] toward the end of the 3rd century.\n[[File:Ousas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gold coin of the Aksumite King [[Ousas]]]]\nChristianity was introduced into the country by [[Saint Frumentius|Frumentius]] {{Citation needed|reason=What about the baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch?|date=March 2020}}, who was consecrated first bishop of Ethiopia by [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius of Alexandria]] about 330. Frumentius converted [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]], who left several inscriptions detailing his reign both before and after his conversion. One inscription found at Axum, states that he conquered the nation of the [[Bogos]], and returned thanks to his father, the god Mars, for his victory. Later inscriptions show Ezana's growing attachment to Christianity, and Ezana's coins bear this out, shifting from a design with disc and crescent to a design with a cross. Expeditions by Ezana into the [[Kingdom of Kush]] at [[Meroe]] in Sudan may have brought about its demise, though there is evidence that the kingdom was experiencing a period of decline beforehand. As a result of Ezana's expansions, Aksum bordered the Roman [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|province of Egypt]]. The degree of Ezana's control over Yemen is uncertain. Though there is little evidence supporting Aksumite control of the region at that time, his title, which includes ''king of Saba and Salhen, Himyar and Dhu-Raydan'' (all in modern-day Yemen), along with gold Aksumite coins with the inscriptions, \"king of the ''[[Habesha|Habshat]]''\" or \"Habashite\", indicate that Aksum might have retained some legal or actual footing in the area.<ref>Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 81.</ref>\n\nToward the close of the 5th century, a great company of monks known as the [[Nine Saints]] are believed to have established themselves in the country. Since that time, [[monasticism]] has been a power among the people, and not without its influence on the course of events.\n[[File:Ethio w3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Aksumite palace at [[Dungur]]]]\nThe Axumite Kingdom is recorded once again as controlling part &ndash; if not all &ndash; of Yemen in the 6th century. Around 523, the [[Jew]]ish king [[Dhu Nuwas]] came to power in Yemen and, announcing that he would kill all the Christians, attacked an Aksumite garrison at [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]], burning the city's churches. He then attacked the Christian stronghold of [[Najran]], slaughtering the Christians who would not convert. Emperor [[Justin I]] of the Eastern Roman empire requested that his fellow Christian, [[Kaleb of Axum|Kaleb]], help fight the Yemenite king, and around 525, Kaleb invaded and defeated Dhu Nuwas, appointing his Christian follower Sumuafa' Ashawa' as his viceroy. This dating is tentative, however, as the basis of the year 525 for the invasion is based on the death of the ruler of Yemen at the time, who very well could have been Kaleb's viceroy.  [[Procopius]] records that after about five years, [[Abraha]] deposed the viceroy and made himself king (''Histories'' 1.20). Despite several attempted invasions across the Red Sea, Kaleb was unable to dislodge Abreha, and acquiesced in the change; this was the last time Ethiopian armies left Africa until the 20th century. Eventually Kaleb abdicated in favor of his son [[W`ZB|Wa'zeb]] and retired to a monastery, where he ended his days. Abraha later made peace with Kaleb's successor and recognized his suzerainty. Despite this reverse, under Ezana and Kaleb the kingdom was at its height, benefiting from a large trade, which extended as far as [[India]] and Ceylon, and were in constant communication with the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nDetails of the Axumite Kingdom, never abundant, become even more scarce after this point. The last king known to mint coins is [[Armah]], whose coinage refers to the Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614. An early [[Muslim]] tradition is that the [[Negus]] [[Sahama]] offered asylum to a group of Muslims fleeing persecution during [[Muhammad]]'s life (615), but Stuart Munro-Hay believes that Axum had been abandoned as the capital by then<ref>Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p.56.</ref> &ndash; although Kobishchanov states that Ethiopian raiders plagued the Red Sea, preying on Arabian ports at least as late as 702.<ref>Kobishchanov, ''Axum'', p.116.</ref>\n\nSome people believed the end of the Axumite Kingdom is as much of a mystery as its beginning. Lacking a detailed history, the kingdom's fall has been attributed to a persistent drought, overgrazing, deforestation, plague, a shift in trade routes that reduced the importance of the Red Sea\u2014or a combination of these factors. Munro-Hay cites the Muslim historian Abu Ja'far al-Khwarazmi/Kharazmi (who wrote before 833) as stating that the capital of \"the kingdom of Habash\" was Jarma. Unless Jarma is a nickname for Axum (hypothetically from Ge'ez ''girma'', \"remarkable, revered\"), the capital had moved from Axum to a new site, yet undiscovered.<ref>Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.95\u201398.</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\n===Zagwe Dynasty===\n{{main|Zagwe dynasty}}\n[[File:Gebre Mesqel Lalibela.png|thumb|upright|[[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]], the [[Zagwe dynasty]] King credited with having constructed the rock-hewn churches of [[Lalibela]].]]\nAbout 1000 (presumably c. 960, though the date is uncertain), a non-[[Christians|Christian]] princess, [[Gudit|Yodit]] (\"Gudit\", a play on Yodit meaning \"evil\"), conspired to murder all the members of the royal family and establish herself as monarch. According to legends, during the execution of the royals, an infant heir of the Axumite monarch was carted off by some faithful adherents and conveyed to [[Shewa]], where his authority was acknowledged. Concurrently, Yodit reigned for forty years over the rest of the kingdom and transmitted the crown to her descendants. Though parts of this story were most likely made up by the [[Solomonic Dynasty]] to legitimize its rule, it is known that a female ruler did conquer the country about this time.\n\nAt one point during the next century, the last of Yodit's successors were overthrown by an [[Agaw]] lord named [[Mara Takla Haymanot]], who founded the [[Zagwe dynasty]] (named after the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] speaking Agaw who ruled during this time) and married a female descendant of the Aksumite monarchs (\"son-in-law\") or previous ruler. Exactly when the new dynasty came to power is unknown, as is the number of kings in the dynasty. The new Zagwe dynasty established its capital at Roha (also called Adeffa), where they build a series of [[monolithic church]]es. These structures are traditionally ascribed to the King [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]], with the city being renamed [[Lalibela]] in his honour; though in truth some of them were built before and after him. The architecture of the Zagwe shows a continuation of earlier Aksumite traditions, as can be seen at Lalibela and at [[Yemrehana Krestos Church]]. The building of rock-hewn churches, which first appeared in the late Aksumite era and continued into the Solomonic dynasty, reached its peak under the Zagwe.\n\nThe Zagwe dynasty controlled a smaller area than the Aksumites or the Solomonic dynasty, with its core in the Lasta region. The Zagwe seem to have ruled over a mostly peaceful state with a flourishing urban culture, in contrast to the more warlike Solomonids with their mobile capitals. David Buxton remarked that the Zagwe achieved 'a degree of stability and technical advancement seldom equalled in Abyssinian history'. The church and state were very closely linked, and they may have had a more [[theocracy|theocratic society]] than the Aksumites or Solomonids, with three Zagwe kings being canonized as saints and [[Yemrehana Krestos|one]] possibly being an ordained priest.<ref>{{cite web|last=Negash|first=Tekeste|title=The Zagwe period re-interpreted: post-Aksumite Ethiopian urban culture|url=http://www.samfak.uu.se/digitalAssets/9/9640_NegashAll.pdf|accessdate=17 March 2014}}</ref>\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Bete Giyorgis 06.jpg\n| width1 = 225\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = St. George Astride His Horse, Church of Bet Giorgis, Lalibela, Ethiopia (3268383996).jpg\n| width2 = 265\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The [[Church of Saint George, Lalibela]] and a [[panel painting]] inside depicting [[Saint George]] [[St George and the Dragon|slaying a dragon]]; it is one of eleven monumental [[Rock-cut architecture|rock-hewn]] churches built in [[Lalibela]], Ethiopia that were allegedly sculpted after a vision by the [[Zagwe dynasty|Zagwe-dynasty]] ruler [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]] (r. 1185\u20131225 AD), in which St George instructed him to do so.<ref>{{citation|last=Riches|first=Samantha|title=St George: A Saint for All|location=London|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|year=2015|isbn=978-1-78023-4519|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IzO6CwAAQBAJ|pages=43\u201344| postscript = .}}</ref> The city of Lalibela was reestablished as a symbolic new holy site, following the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1187)|fall of Jerusalem]] to the Muslim forces of [[Saladin]] in 1187 AD, yet archaeology reveals the [[Architecture of Ethiopia|religious structures]] to have been built between the 10th and early 12th centuries AD, with perhaps only the last phase carried out during the 13th century AD and reign of Gebre Mesqel Lalibela.<ref>{{citation|last=Sobania|first=Neal W.|title=Dictionary of African Biography|chapter=Lalibela|page=462|location=Oxford|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2012|isbn=978-0-19-538207-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=39JMAgAAQBAJ|editor1-first=Emmanuel|editor1-last=Akyeampong|editor2-first=Henry Louis, Jr.|editor2-last=Gates| postscript = .}}</ref>\n}}\n\n====Foreign Affairs====\nUnlike the Aksumites, the Zagwe were very isolated from the other Christian Nations, although they did maintain a degree of contact through [[Jerusalem]] and Cairo.

During this trip, the Ethiopian mission also travelled to France, Spain and Portugal in the hopes of building an alliance against the Muslim states then threatening Ethiopia's existence. Plans were even drawn up of a two-pronged invasion of Egypt with the French King, but nothing ever came of the talks, although this brought Ethiopia back to Europe's attention, leading to expansion of European influence when the Portuguese explorers reached the Indian Ocean.<ref>Pankhurst, Richard.

The title of n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st was to a considerable extent based on their alleged direct descent from Solomon and the queen of Sheba; but it is needless to say that in many, if not in most, cases their success was due more to the force of their arms than to the purity of their [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. Under the early Solomonic dynasty Ethiopia engaged in military reforms and imperial expansion which left it dominating the Horn of Africa, especially under the rule of [[Amda Seyon I]]. There was also great artistic and literary advancement at this time, but also a decline in urbanisation as the Solomonic emperors didn't have any fixed capital, but rather moved around the empire in mobile camps.\n\nUnder the early Solomonic dynasty monasticism grew strongly. The abbot Abba [[Ewostatewos]] created a new order called the Ewostathians who called for reforms in the church, including observance of the Sabbath, but was persecuted for his views and eventually forced into exile, eventually dying in Armenia. His zealous followers, also persecuted, formed isolated communities in Tigray. The movement grew strong enough that the emperor [[Dawit I]], after first trying to crush the movement, legalized their observance of the Sabbath and proselytization of their faith. Finally under [[Zara Yaqob]] a compromise was made between the new Egyptian bishops and the Ewostathians at the Council of Mitmaq in 1450, restoring unity to the Ethiopian church.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=Harold|title=A History of Ethiopia|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofethiopi00marc|url-access=registration|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n====Relations with Europe and \"Prester John\"====\nAn interesting side-effect of Ethiopian Christianity was the way it intersected with a belief that had long prevailed in Europe of the existence of a Christian kingdom in the far east, whose monarch was known as [[Prester John]]. Originally thought to have been in the Orient, eventually the search for Prester John's mythical kingdom focused on Africa and particularly, the Christian empire in Ethiopia. This was first noticed when [[Zara Yaqob]] sent delegates to the Council of Florence in order to establish ties with the papacy and Western Christianity.<ref name=\"dacb\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/ethiopia/zarea_yaeqob.html|title=Zare'a Ya'eqob, Ethiopia, Orthodox|website=dacb.org|access-date=2017-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806234930/http://www.dacb.org/stories/ethiopia/zarea_yaeqob.html|archive-date=2016-08-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> They were confused when they arrived and council prelates insisted on calling their monarch [[Prester John]], trying to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, the delegates' admonitions did little to stop Europeans from referring to the monarch as their mythical Christian king, Prester John.<ref>[[Robert Silverberg|Silverberg, Robert]], ''The Realm of Prester John'', [[Ohio University Press]], 1996 (paperback edition) {{ISBN|1-84212-409-9}}, p. 189</ref>\n\nTowards the close of the 15th century the Portuguese missions into Ethiopia began.  Among others engaged in this search was [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]], who arrived in Ethiopia in 1490, and, believing that he had at length reached the far-famed kingdom, presented to the n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st of the country ([[Eskender]] at the time) a letter from his master the [[king of Portugal]], addressed to Prester John. Covilh\u00e3 would establish positive relations between the two states and go on to remain there for many years. In 1507, the Emperor sent an Armenian named [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Matthew]] to the king of [[Portugal]] to request his aid against the Muslims. In 1520, the Portuguese fleet, with Matthew on board, entered the Red Sea in compliance with this request, and an embassy from the fleet visited the Emperor, [[Dawit II of Ethiopia|Lebna Dengel]], and remained in Ethiopia for about six years. One of this embassy was Father [[Francisco \u00c1lvares]], who wrote one of the earliest accounts of the country.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite book|last=Baynes|first=Thomas Spencer|title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature, Volume 1|year=1838|publisher=Henry G.

Entering, from the low country to the south-east, and overran much of the Ethiopian plateau, forcing the Emperor to take refuge in the mountain [[wiktionary:fastness|fastnesses]]. In this remote location, the ruler again turned to the Portuguese. Jo\u00e3o Bermudes, a subordinate member of the mission of 1520, who had remained in the country after the departure of the embassy, was sent to Lisbon. Bermudes claimed to be the ordained successor to the ''[[Abuna]]'' (archbishop), but his credentials are disputed.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn response to Bermudes message, a Portuguese fleet under the command of [[Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama (16th century)|Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama]], was sent from India and arrived at [[Massawa]] in February 1541. Here he received an ambassador from the Emperor beseeching him to send help against the Muslims, and in the July following a force of 400 musketeers, under the command of [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Gama]], younger brother of the admiral, marched into the interior, and being joined by native troops were at first successful against the enemy; but they were subsequently defeated at the [[Battle of Wofla]] (28 August 1542), and their commander captured and executed. On February 21,1543, however, Al-Ghazi was shot and killed in the [[Battle of Wayna Daga]] and his forces were totally routed. After this, quarrels arose between the Emperor and Bermudes, who had returned to Ethiopia with Gama and now urged the emperor to publicly profess his obedience to Rome. This the Emperor refused to do, and at length Bermudes was obliged to make his way out of the country.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\n===Oromo Movements===\nThe '''Oromo migrations''' were a series of expansions in the 16th and 17th centuries by the [[Oromo people]] from southern areas of Ethiopia to more northern regions. The migrations had a severe impact on the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of Abyssinia, as well as being the death blow to the recently defeated [[Adal Sultanate]]. The migrations concluded in around 1710, when the Oromo conquered the kingdom of [[Ennarea]] in the [[Gibe region]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the 17th century, Ethiopian emperor [[Susenyos I]] relied on Oromo support to gain power, and married an Oromo woman. While initial relations between the Oromo and Amhara were cordial, conflict erupted after the emperor tried to convert the Oromo to Christianity.<ref name=oromo>{{cite book|author=Marco Demichelis|title=Islamisation: Comparative Perspectives from History|chapter =THE OROMO AND THE HISTORICAL PROCESS OF ISLAMISATION IN ETHIOPIA|pages=223-243|publisher=Edinburgh University Press}}</ref> Many Oromo entered in emperor Susenyos' domain in response.<ref name=oromo/>\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, much of the Oromo people gradually underwent conversion to Islam, especially around [[Harar]], [[Arsi Province|Arsi]] and [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|Bale]]. The Oromo Muslims regarded the Imam of [[Harar]] as their spiritual guide, while retaining some of their original culture and socio-political organisation. Scholars believe the Oromo converted to Islam as a means of preserving their identity and a bulwark against assimilation into Ethiopia.<ref name=oromo/>\n\nBy late 17th century, the Oromo had friendly relations with the Amharas. So when emperor [[Iyasu I]] tried to attack the Oromo, he was convinced by local Amharic rulers to back down. The Oromo also formed political coalitions with previously subdued people of Ethiopia, including the [[Sidama people]] and the locals of [[Ennarea]], [[Gibe (woreda)|Gibe]] and [[Kingdom of Damot]].<ref name=oromo/>\n\n==Gondarine Period==\nGondar as a third permanent capital (after ''Aksum'' and ''Lalibela'') of the Christian Kingdom was founded by Fasiladas in 1636. It was the most important center of commerce for the Kingdom.<ref>Grade 9th History text</ref>\n\n===Early Gondar period (1632\u20131769)===\n[[File:ET Gondar asv2018-02 img03 Fasil Ghebbi.jpg|thumb|The Royal Enclosure ([[Fasil Ghebbi]]) of [[Gondar]].]]\nThe [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] who had accompanied or followed the Gama expedition into Ethiopia, and fixed their headquarters at [[Fremona]] (near [[Adwa]]), were oppressed and neglected, but not actually expelled. In the beginning of the 17th century Father [[Pedro P\u00e1ez]] arrived at Fremona, a man of great tact and judgment, who soon rose into high favour at court, and won over the emperor to his faith. He directed the erection of churches, palaces and bridges in different parts of the country, and carried out many useful works. His successor [[Afonso Mendes]] was less tactful, and excited the feelings of the people against him and his fellow Europeans. Upon the death of Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia|Susenyos]] and accession of his son [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]] in 1633, the Jesuits were expelled and the native religion restored to official status. Fasilides made [[Gondar]] his capital and built a castle there which would grow into the castle complex known as the [[Fasil Ghebbi]], or Royal Enclosure. Fasilides also constructed several churches in Gondar, many bridges across the country, and expanded the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in Aksum.\n\nDuring this time of religious strife [[Ethiopian philosophy]] flourished, and it was during this period that the philosophers [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]] and [[Walda Heywat]] lived. Zera Yaqob is known for his treatise on religion, morality, and reason, known as [[Hatata]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kiros|first=Teodoros|title=The Meditations of Zara Yaquob|url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Afri/AfriKiro.htm|accessdate=18 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016192444/http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Afri/AfriKiro.htm|archive-date=16 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Aussa Sultanate====\n{{Main|Sultanate of Aussa|Mudaito Dynasty}}\n[[File:Red Red.svg|thumb|right|180px|State flag of the [[Aussa Sultanate]].]]\nThe [[Sultanate of Aussa]] (Afar Sultanate) succeeded the earlier [[Imamate of Aussa]]. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577, when [[Muhammed Jasa]] moved his capital from [[Harar]] to [[Asaita|Aussa]] with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and the Harari city-state. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with Imam [[Umar Din bin Adam]]'s recorded ascension to the throne.<ref>Abir, p. 23 n.1.</ref>\n\nThe Sultanate was subsequently re-established by [[Kedafu]] around the year 1734, and was thereafter ruled by his [[Mudaito Dynasty]].<ref>Abir, pp. 23\u201326.</ref> The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver [[Baton (symbol)|baton]], which was considered to have magical properties.<ref>Trimingham, p. 262.</ref>\n\n===Zemene Mesafint===\n{{main|Zemene Mesafint}}\nThis era was, on one hand, a religious conflict between settling Muslims and traditional Christians, between nationalities they represented, and, on the other hand, between feudal lords on power over the central government.\n\nSome historians date the murder of [[Iyasu I of Ethiopia|Iyasu I]], and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty, as the beginning of the Ethiopian [[Zemene Mesafint]] (\"Era of the Princes\"), a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords.\n[[File:Early nineteenth century warriors Colour.jpg|thumb|left|Warriors in Abyssinia]]\nNobles came to abuse their positions by making emperors, and encroached upon the succession of the dynasty, by candidates among the nobility itself: e.g. on the death of [[Tewoflos of Ethiopia|Emperor Tewoflos]], the chief nobles of Ethiopia feared that the cycle of vengeance that had characterized the reigns of Tewoflos and [[Tekle Haymanot I of Ethiopia|Tekle Haymanot I]] would continue if a member of the Solomonic dynasty were picked for the throne, so they selected one of their own, [[Yostos of Ethiopia|Yostos]] to be ''negusa nagast'' (king of kings) \u2013 however his tenure was brief.\n\n[[Iyasu II]] ascended the throne as a child. His mother, [[Mentewab|Empress Mentewab]] played a major role in Iyasu's reign, as well as her grandson [[Iyoas I of Ethiopia|Iyoas]] too. Mentewab had herself crowned as co-ruler, becoming the first woman to be crowned in this manner in Ethiopian history.\n\nEmpress Mentewab was crowned co-ruler upon the succession of her son (a first for a woman in Ethiopia) in 1730, and held unprecedented power over government during his reign. Her attempt to continue in this role following the death of her son 1755 led her into conflict with Wubit (Welete Bersabe), his widow, who believed that it was her turn to preside at the court of her own son Iyoas. The conflict between these two queens led to Mentewab summoning her Kwaran relatives and their forces to Gondar to support her. Wubit responded by summoning her own [[Oromo people|Oromo]] relatives and their considerable forces from [[Yejju]].\n\nThe treasury of the Empire being allegedly penniless on the death of Iyasu, it suffered further from ethnic conflict between nationalities that had been part of the Empire for hundreds of years\u2014the Agaw, Amharans, Showans, and [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigreans]]\u2014and the Oromo newcomers. Mentewab's attempt to strengthen ties between the monarchy and the Oromo by arranging the marriage of her son to the daughter of an Oromo chieftain backfired in the long run. Iyasu II gave precedence to his mother and allowed her every prerogative as a crowned co-ruler, while his wife Wubit suffered in obscurity. Wubit waited for the accession of her own son to make a bid for the power wielded for so long by Mentewab and her relatives from [[Qwara province|Qwara]]. When Iyoas assumed the throne upon his father's sudden death, the aristocrats of [[Gondar]] were stunned to find that he more readily spoke in the [[Oromo language]] rather than in [[Amharic language|Amharic]], and tended to favor his mother's Yejju relatives over the Qwarans of his grandmothers family. Iyoas further increased the favor given to the Oromo when adult. On the death of the Ras of Amhara, he attempted to promote his uncle Lubo governor of that province, but the outcry led his advisor [[Wolde Leul]] to convince him to change his mind.\n\nIt is believed that the power struggle between the Qwarans led by the Empress Mentewab, and the Yejju Oromos led by the Emperor's mother Wubit was about to erupt into an armed conflict. Ras [[Mikael Sehul]] was summoned to mediate between the two camps. He arrived and shrewdly maneuvered to sideline the two queens and their supporters making a bid for power for himself. Mikael settled soon as the leader of Amharic-Tigrean (Christian) camp of the struggle.\n\nThe reign of Iyaos' reign becomes a narrative of the struggle between the powerful Ras Mikael Sehul and the Oromo relatives of Iyoas. As Iyoas increasingly favored Oromo leaders like Fasil, his relations with Mikael Sehul deteriorated. Eventually Mikael Sehul deposed the Emperor Iyoas (7 May 1769). One week later, Mikael Sehul had him killed; although the details of his death are contradictory, the result was clear: for the first time an Emperor had lost his throne in a means other than his own natural death, death in battle, or voluntary abdication.\n\nMikael Sehul had compromised the power of the Emperor, and from this point forward it lay ever more openly in the hands of the great nobles and military commanders. This point of time has been regarded as one start of the Era of the Princes.\n\nAn aged and infirm imperial uncle prince was enthroned as Emperor [[Yohannes II of Ethiopia|Yohannes II]]. Ras Mikael soon had him murdered, and underage [[Tekle Haymanot II of Ethiopia|Tekle Haymanot II]] was elevated to the throne.\n\nThis bitter religious conflict contributed to hostility toward foreign Christians and Europeans, which persisted into the 20th century and was a factor in Ethiopia's isolation until the mid-19th century, when the first British mission, sent in 1805 to conclude an alliance with Ethiopia and obtain a port on the Red Sea in case [[France]] conquered Egypt. The success of this mission opened Ethiopia to many more travellers, missionaries and merchants of all countries, and the stream of Europeans continued until well into [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros]]'s reign.\n\nThis isolation was pierced by very few European travellers. One was the French physician [[Charles Jacques Poncet|C.J. Poncet]], who went there in 1698, via [[Kingdom of Sennar|Sennar]] and the Blue Nile. After him [[James Bruce]] entered the country in 1769, with the object of discovering the sources of the Nile, which he was convinced lay in Ethiopia. Accordingly, leaving Massawa in September 1769, he travelled via Axum to Gondar, where he was well received by Emperor Tekle Haymanot II. He accompanied the king on a warlike expedition round [[Lake Tana]], moving South round the eastern shore, crossing the Blue Nile ([[Abay River|Abay]]) close to its point of issue from the lake and returning via the western shore. Bruce subsequently returned to Egypt at the end of 1772 by way of the upper [[Atbara river|Atbara]], through the kingdom of Sennar, the Nile, and the [[Korosko desert]].\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:image241wiki.JPG|thumb|230px|The palace in Gondar]] -->\nDuring the 18th century the most prominent rulers were the emperor [[Dawit III of Ethiopia|Dawit III]] of Gondar (died May 18, 1721), [[Amha Iyasus]] of Shewa, who consolidated his kingdom and founded [[Ankober]], and [[Tekle Giyorgis I of Ethiopia|Tekle Giyorgis]] of Amhara \u2013 the last-mentioned is famous as having been elevated to the throne altogether six times and also deposed six times. The first years of the 19th century were disturbed by fierce campaigns between [[Ras (title)|Ras]] [[Gugsa of Yejju|Gugsa]] of Begemder, and Ras [[Wolde Selassie]] of Tigray, who fought over control of the figurehead Emperor [[Egwale Seyon of Ethiopia|Egwale Seyon]].

His father was a small local chief, and his relative (possibly uncle) ''Dejazmach'' [[Kinfu]] was governor of the provinces of [[Dembiya]], Qwara and [[Chelga]] between Lake Tana and the northwestern frontier. Kassa lost his inheritance upon the death of Kinfu while he was still a young boy. After receiving a traditional education in a local monastery, he went off to lead a band of bandits that roved the country in a Robin Hood-like existence. His exploits became widely known, and his band of followers grew steadily until he led a formidable army. He came to the notice of the ruling Regent, Ras Ali, and his mother Empress [[Menen Liben Amede]] (wife of the Emperor [[Yohannes III of Ethiopia|Yohannes III]]). In order to bind him to them, the Empress arranged for Kassa to marry Ali's daughter. He turned his attention to conquering the remaining [[Subdivisions of Ethiopia|chief divisions of the country]], Gojjam, Tigray and Shewa, which still remained unsubdued. His relations with his father-in-law and grandmother-in-law deteriorated however, and he soon took up arms against them and their vassals, and was successful.\n[[File:Abyssinia1891map excerpt2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Map of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in the 19th century.]]\nOn February 11,1855, Kassa deposed the last of the Gondarine puppet Emperors, and was crowned ''negusa nagast'' of Ethiopia under the name of Tewodros II. He soon after advanced against Shewa with a large army. Chief of the notables opposing him was its king [[Haile Melekot]], a descendant of [[Meridazmach]] [[Asfa Wossen]]. Dissensions broke out among the Shewans, and after a desperate and futile attack on Tewodros at [[Dabra Berhan]], Haile Melekot died of illness, nominating with his last breath his eleven-year-old son as successor (November 1855) under the name Negus Sahle Maryam (the future emperor [[Menelek II]]). [[Darge Sahle Selassie|Darge]], Haile Melekot's brother, and Ato Bezabih, a Shewan noble, took charge of the young prince, but after a hard fight with Angeda, the Shewans were obliged to capitulate. Sahle Maryam was handed over to the Emperor Tewodoros and taken to Gondar. He was trained there in Tewodros's service, and then placed in comfortable detention at the fortress of [[Magdala, Ethiopia|Magdala]]. Tewodoros afterwards devoted himself to modernizing and centralizing the legal and [[Subdivisions of Ethiopia|administrative structure of his kingdom]], against the resistance of his governors. Sahle Maryam of Shewa was married to Tewodros II's daughter Alitash.\n\nIn 1865, Sahle Maryam escaped from Magdala, abandoning his wife, and arrived in Shewa, and was there acclaimed as [[Negus]]. Tewodros forged an alliance between Britain and Ethiopia, but as explained in the next section, he committed suicide after a military defeat by the British. On the death of Tewodros, many Shewans, including Ras Darge, were released, and the young Negus of Shewa began to feel himself strong enough, after a few preliminary minor campaigns, to undertake offensive operations against the northern princes. However, these projects were of little avail, for Ras Kassai of Tigray had by this time (1872) risen to supreme power in the north. Proclaiming himself ''negusa nagast'' under the name of Yohannes IV (or John IV), he forced Sahle Maryam to acknowledge his overlordship.\n\nIn early 1868, the British force seeking Tewodros\u2019 surrender, after he refused to release imprisoned British subjects, arrived on the coast of Massawa. The British and Dajazmach Kassa came to an agreement in which Kassa would let the British pass through Tigray (the British were going to Magdala which Tewodros had made his capital) in exchange for money and weapons. Surely enough, when the British completed their mission and were leaving the country, they rewarded Kassa for his cooperation with artillery, muskets, rifles, and munitions, all in all worth approximately \u00a3500,000.<ref>Marcus 2002, pp.&nbsp;71\u201372</ref> This formidable gift came in handy when in July 1871 the current emperor, Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II, attacked Kassa at his capital in Adwa, for Kassa had refused to be named a ras or pay tribute.<ref>Marcus, H. 2002, 72</ref> Although Kassa's army was outnumbered 12,000 to the emperor's 60,000, Kassa's army was equipped with more modern weapons and better trained.

In this year Count [[Pietro Antonelli]] was dispatched to Shewa in order to improve the prospects of the colony by treaties with Sahle Maryam of Shewa and the sultan of [[Asaita|Aussa]].\n\nIn 1887 Menelik king of [[Shewa]] invaded the [[Emirate of Harar]] after his victory at the [[Battle of chelenqo]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=CAULK |first1=RICHARD |title=The Occupation of Harar: January 1887 |journal=Journal of Ethiopian Studies |volume=9 |issue=2 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/41967469?Search=yes&resultItemClick=true&searchText=occupation&searchText=of&searchText=harar&searchUri=%2Faction%2FdoBasicSearch%3FQuery%3Doccupation%2Bof%2Bharar%26amp%3Bacc%3Doff%26amp%3Bwc%3Don%26amp%3Bfc%3Doff%26amp%3Bgroup%3Dnone&ab_segments=0%2Fbasic_SYC-4946%2Fcontrol&refreqid=search%3A3f1307325d9e7ae203e773fb8810fbf0&seq=1}}</ref>\n\nIn April 1888 the Italian forces, numbering over 20,000 men, came in contact with the Ethiopian army, but negotiations took the place of fighting, with the result that both forces retired, the Italians only leaving some 5,000 troops in [[Eritrea]], later to become an Italian colony.\n\nMeanwhile, Emperor Yohannes IV had been engaged with the [[dervish]]es, who had in the meantime become masters of the [[History of Sudan under Muhammad Ali and his successors|Egyptian Sudan]], and in 1887 a great battle ensued at [[Battle of Gallabat|Gallabat]], in which the dervishes, under Zeki Tumal, were beaten. But a stray bullet struck the king, and the Ethiopians decided to retire. The king died during the night, and his body fell into the hands of the enemy (March 9, 1889). When the news of Yohannes's death reached Sahle Maryam of Shewa, he proclaimed himself emperor [[Menelik II of Ethiopia]], and received the submission of [[Begemder]], Gojjam, the [[Yejju Oromo]], and Tigray.<ref name=\"britannica.com\"/>\n\n==== Menelik II (1889\u20131913) ====\n{{main|Battle of Adwa}}\n[[File:EthiopiaRAND1908.jpg|thumb|left|Ethiopia in 1908, according to a Rand McNally map]]\nOn May 2 of that same year, Emperor Menelik signed the [[Treaty of Wuchale]] with the Italians, granting them a portion of Northern Ethiopia, the area that would later be Eritrea and part of the province of Tigray in return for the promise of 30,000 rifles, ammunition, and cannons.<ref>Pakenham, ''The Scramble for Africa'', pp. 472\u20133</ref> The Italians notified the European powers that this treaty gave them a protectorate over all of Ethiopia.

A provisional treaty of peace was concluded at [[Addis Ababa]] on October 26, 1896, which acknowledged the independence of Ethiopia.\n\nMenelik granted the first railway concession, from the coast at [[Djibouti]] (French Somaliland) to the interior, to a French company in 1894.

Haile Selassie sent hundreds of young men and women to study abroad, set up the capital's second modern school in 1925.

They occupied the capital Addis Ababa on May 5. Emperor Haile Selassie pleaded to the [[League of Nations]] for aid in resisting the Italians. Nevertheless, the country was formally annexed on May 9, 1936, and the Emperor went into exile.\n\nThe war was full of cruelty: the Ethiopians used [[Dum-dum]] bullets (prohibited by the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]] of 1899, Declaration IV,3) and began mutilating captured soldiers (often with castration) since the first weeks of war,{{sfn|Antonicelli|1975|p=79}} while the Italians used gas (prohibited under the [[Geneva Protocol]] of 1922).<ref>Antonicelli, Franco.

They were replaced with two new systems. There was a prestige operation for Italians, and rudimentary one for native Ethiopians. Textbooks featured the glory and power of Mussolini and promoted military careers. The natives were given a rudimentary primary education focused on producing submissive and obedient servants of the empire.

On May 5, 1941, Emperor Haile Selassie re-entered Addis Ababa and returned to the throne. The Italians, after their final stand at [[Gondar]] in November 1941, conducted a [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|guerrilla war in Ethiopia]], that lasted until summer 1943.

The country's first important school of higher education, [[Addis Ababa University|University College of Addis Ababa]], was founded in 1950.  The [[1931 Constitution of Ethiopia|Constitution of 1931]] was replaced with the [[1955 Constitution of Ethiopia|1955 constitution]] which expanded the powers of the Parliament.  While improving diplomatic ties with the [[United States]], Haile Selassie also sought to improve the nation's relationship with other African nations.  To do this, in 1963, he helped to found the [[Organisation of African Unity]].\n\nIn 1961 the 30-year [[Eritrean War for Independence|Eritrean Struggle for Independence]] began, following the Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]'s dissolution of the federation and shutting down the Eritrean parliament. The Emperor declared Eritrea the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in 1962.<ref>Semere Haile ''The Origins and Demise of the Ethiopia-Eritrea Federation'' Issue: A Journal of Opinion, Vol. 15, 1987 (1987), pp. 9\u201317</ref> The [[Negus]] suffered criticism due to the expenses involved in fighting the Nationalist forces.\n\nBy the early 1970s Emperor Haile Selassie's advanced age was becoming apparent. As Paul B. Henze explains:  \"Most Ethiopians thought in terms of personalities, not ideology, and out of long habit still looked to Haile Selassie as the initiator of change, the source of status and privilege, and the arbiter of demands for resources and attention among competing groups.\"<ref>Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 282.</ref>  The nature of the succession, and of the desirability of the Imperial monarchy in general, were in dispute amongst the Ethiopian people.\n\nPerceptions of this war as imperialist were among the primary causes of the growing Ethiopian [[Marxist]] movement. In the early 1970s, the Ethiopian [[Communists]] received the support of the [[Soviet Union]] under the leadership of [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. This help led to the 1974 marxist coup of [[Mengistu]].\n\nThe government's failure to effect significant economic and political reforms over the previous fourteen years created a climate of unrest. Combined with rising inflation, corruption, a famine that affected several provinces (especially [[Welo]] and [[Tigray Province|Tigray]]) but was concealed from the outside world, and the growing discontent of urban interest groups, the country was ripe for revolution. The unrest that began in January 1974 became an outburst of general discontent. The Ethiopian military, with assistance from the [[Comintern]], began to both organize and incite a full-fledged revolution.<ref name=CountryStudy>{{cite book |title=A Country Study: Ethiopia |year=1991 |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-8444-0739-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/ethiopiacountrys00ofca |edition=4th |editor1=Thomas P.

The Derg summarily executed 59 members of the former government, including two former Prime Ministers and Crown Councilors, Court officials, ministers, and generals.  Emperor Haile Selassie died on August 22, 1975.  He was allegedly strangled in the basement of his palace or smothered with a wet pillow.<ref>Martin Meredith, ''The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence'' (Public Affairs Publishing: New York, 2005) p. 217.</ref>\n\nLt.

The new Marxist government undertook socialist reforms, including [[nationalisation]] of landlords' property<ref name=\"Martin Meredith p. 244\">Martin Meredith, ''The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence'', p. 244.</ref> and the church's property. Before the coup, Ethiopian peasants' way of life was thoroughly influenced by the church teachings; 280 days a year are religious feasts or days of rest. Mengistu's years in office were marked by a totalitarian-style government and the country's massive militarization, financed by the [[Soviet Union]] and the Eastern Bloc, and assisted by [[Cuba]]. In December 1976, an Ethiopian delegation in [[Moscow]] signed a military assistance agreement with the Soviet Union. The following April 1977, Ethiopia abrogated its military assistance agreement with the United States and expelled the American military missions.\n\nThe new regime in Ethiopia met with armed resistance from the large landowners, the royalists and the nobility.<ref name=\"Martin Meredith p. 244\"/> The resistance was largely centered in the province of Eritrea.<ref>Martin Meredith, ''The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence'', p. 245.</ref>  The Derg decided in November 1974 to pursue war in Eritrea rather than seek a negotiated settlement.

Twenty years later, the Somali region of Ethiopia remained under-developed and insecure.\n\nFrom 1977 through early 1978, thousands of suspected enemies of the Derg were tortured and/or killed in a purge called the [[Qey Shibir]] (\"Red Terror\"). Communism was officially adopted during the late 1970s and early 1980s; in 1984, the [[Workers' Party of Ethiopia]] (WPE) was established, and on February 1, 1987, a [[1987 Constitution of Ethiopia|new Soviet-style civilian constitution]] was submitted to a popular referendum. It was officially endorsed by 81% of voters, and in accordance with this new constitution, the country was renamed the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] on September 10, 1987, and Mengistu became president.\n\nThe regime's collapse was hastened by droughts and [[1983\u201385 famine in Ethiopia|a famine]], which affected around 8 million people and left 1 million dead, as well as by insurrections, particularly in the northern regions of Tigray and Eritrea. The regime also conducted a brutal campaign of [[resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia]] in the 1980s. In 1989, the [[Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front]] (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements to form the [[Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF).

Finally, on December 20, 2006, active [[War in Somalia (2006\u201309)|fighting broke out]] between the ICU and Ethiopian Army. As the Islamist forces were of no match against the Ethiopian regular army, they decided to retreat and merge among the civilians, and most of the ICU-held Somalia was quickly taken. [[Human Rights Watch]] accused Ethiopia of various abuses including indiscriminate killing of civilians during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (March \u2013 April 2007)]]. Ethiopian forces pulled out of Somalia in January 2009, leaving a small African Union force and smaller Somali Transitional Government force to maintain the peace.

The [[Ethiopian Empire]] (Abyssinia) was first founded by Ethiopian people in the [[Ethiopian Highlands]]. Due to migration and imperial expansion, it grew to include many other primarily [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]]-speaking communities, including [[Oromo people|Oromos]], [[Amhara people|Amhara]], [[Somali people|Somalis]], [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigray]], [[Afar people|Afars]], [[Sidama people|Sidama]], [[Gurage people|Gurage]], [[Agaw people|Agaw]] and [[Harari people|Harari]], among others.\n\nOne of the early kingdoms to rise to power in the territory was the kingdom of [[D'mt]] in the 10th century BC, which established its capital at [[Yeha]]. In the first century AD the [[Aksumite Kingdom]] rose to power in the [[Tigray Region]] with its capital at [[Aksum]] and grew into a major power on the [[Red Sea]], subjugating [[Yemen]] and [[Meroe]] and converting to [[Christianity]] in the early fourth century. The Aksumite empire fell into decline with the rise of [[Islam]] in the Arabian peninsula, which slowly shifted trade away from the Christian Aksum. It eventually became isolated, then economy slumped and Aksum's commercial domination of the region was over.<ref>{{cite web |title=Ethiopian History |url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com |accessdate=2 July 2019}}</ref> The Aksumites gave way to the [[Zagwe Dynasty]], who established a new capital at [[Lalibela]] before giving way to the [[Solomonic Dynasty]] in the 13th century. During the early Solomonic period, Ethiopia went through military reforms and imperial expansion that made it dominate the [[Horn of Africa]]. Portuguese missionaries arrived at this time.\n\nIn 1529, the [[Adal Sultanate]] [[Abyssinian\u2013Adal war|attempted to conquer Abyssinia]] and met initial success; the Adal were supplied by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]s while Abyssinia received [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] reinforcements. By 1543, Abyssinia had recaptured lost territory but the war had weakened both sides. The [[Oromo people]] were able to expand into the highlands, conquering both the Adal Sultanate and Abyssinia. The Portuguese presence also increased, while the Ottomans began to push into what is now [[Eritrea]], creating the [[Habesh Eyalet]]. The Portuguese brought modern weapons and [[baroque architecture]] to Ethiopia, and in 1622 converted the emperor [[Susenyos I]] to Catholicism, sparking a civil war which ended in his abdication and expulsion of all Catholics from Ethiopia. A new capital was established at [[Gondar]] in 1632, and a period of peace and prosperity ensued until the country was split apart by warlords in the 18th century during the [[Zemene Mesafint]].\n\nEthiopia was reunified in 1855 under [[Tewodros II]], beginning [[Ethiopian historiography|Ethiopia's modern history]] and his reign was followed by [[Yohannes IV]] who was killed in action in 1889. Under [[Menelik II]] Ethiopia started its transformation to well organized technological advancement and the structure that the country has now. [[Ethiopia]] also expanded to the south and east, through the conquest of the western Oromo (now Shoan Oromo), [[Sidama Zone|Sidama]], [[Gurage Zone|Gurage]], Wolayta and other groups, resulting in the borders of modern Ethiopia. Ethiopia defeated an [[Ethiopian\u2013Egyptian War|Egyptian invasion in 1876]] and an [[First Italo-Ethiopian War|Italian invasion in 1896]] which killed 17,000 Ethiopians,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Etemad |first1=Bouda |title=Possessing the World: Taking the Measurements of Colonisation from the 18th to the 20th Century |date=2007 |page=87}}</ref> and came to be recognised as a legitimate state by European powers. A more rapid modernisation took place under Menelik II and [[Haile Selassie]]. Italy launched a second invasion [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|in 1935]]. From 1935-1941, Ethiopia was under [[Italian Ethiopia|Italian occupation]] as part of [[Italian East Africa]]. A joint force of British and Ethiopian rebels managed to drive the Italians out of the country in 1941, and Haile Selassie was returned to the throne. Ethiopia and Eritrea united in a federation, but when Haile Selassie ended the federation in 1961 and made Eritrea a province of Ethiopia, the 30-year [[Eritrean War of Independence]] broke out. Eritrea regained its independence after a referendum in 1993.\n\nHaile Selassie was overthrown in 1974 and the militaristic [[Derg]] Regime came to power. In 1977 [[Somalia]] [[Ogaden War|invaded]], trying to [[Greater Somalia|annex]] the [[Ogaden region]], but were pushed back by Ethiopian, Soviet, and Cuban forces. In 1977 and 1978 the government tortured or killed hundreds of thousands of suspected enemies in the [[Red Terror (Ethiopia)|Red Terror]].

Earlier inscription of [[Ezana of Aksum|Ezana]] ''Habashat'' (the source for \"Abyssinia\") in [[Ge'ez language|Ge'ez]], [[South Arabian alphabet]], was then translated in [[Greek language|Greek]] as  \"Aethiopia\".\n\nThe state of [[Sheba]] which is mentioned in the [[Old Testament]] is sometimes believed to have been in Ethiopia, but it is more often placed in [[Yemen]]. According to the Ethiopian narrative, best represented in the ''[[Kebra Nagast]]'', the [[Queen of Sheba]] slept with [[King Solomon]] and bore a child named Ebn Melek (later Emperor [[Menelik I]]). When he was of age, Menelik returned to [[Israel]] to see his father, who sent with him the son of [[Zadok (High Priest)|Zadok]] to accompany him with a replica of the [[Ark of the Covenant]] (Ethiosemitic: ''[[tabot]]''). On his return with some of the [[Israelites|Israelite]] [[Priesthood (ancient Israel)|priests]], however, he found that Zadok's son had stolen the real Ark of the Covenant. Some believe the Ark is still being preserved today at the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in Axum, Ethiopia.  The tradition that the biblical Queen of Sheba was a ruler of Ethiopia who visited King Solomon in [[Jerusalem]] in [[History of ancient Israel and Judah|ancient Israel]] is supported by the 1st century AD Jewish historian [[Flavius Josephus]], who identified Solomon's visitor as a queen of Egypt and Ethiopia.\n\n===D\u02bfmt===\n{{main|D\u02bfmt}}\n[[File:Yeha Tigray Ethiopia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Temple at [[Yeha]], possible capital of [[D'mt]].]]\nThe first kingdom known to have existed in Ethiopia was the kingdom of D'mt, with its capital at [[Yeha]], where a [[Sabaean]] style temple was built around 700 BC. It rose to power around the 10th century BC. The D'mt kingdom was influenced by the Sabaeans in Yemen, however it is not known to what extent. While it was once believed that D'mt was a Sabaean colony, it is now believed that Sabaean influence was minor, limited to a few localities, and disappeared after a few decades or a century, perhaps representing a trading or military colony in some sort of symbiosis or military alliance with the civilization of D\u02bfmt or some other proto-Aksumite state.<ref>Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 57.</ref><ref>Phillipson. \"''The First Millennium BC in the Highlands of Northern Ethiopia and South\u2013Central Eritrea: A Reassessment of Cultural and Political Development\".

As a result, it is not known whether D\u02bfmt ended as a civilization before [[Aksum]]'s early stages, evolved into the Aksumite state, or was one of the smaller states united in the [[Kingdom of Aksum|Aksumite kingdom]] possibly around the beginning of the 1st century.<ref>Uhlig, Siegbert (ed.), ''Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: D-Ha''. Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz Verlag, 2005. p. 185.</ref>\n\n===Axum===\n{{main|Kingdom of Aksum}}\n[[File:Stela aksum.jpg|thumb|upright|[[King Ezana's Stele]] in Aksum.]]\nThe first verifiable kingdom of great power to rise in Ethiopia was that of Axum in the 1st century AD. It was one of many successor kingdoms to [[D\u02bfmt]] and was able to unite the northern [[Ethiopian Highlands]] beginning around the 1st century BC. They established bases on the northern highlands of the Ethiopian Plateau and from there expanded southward. The [[Sassanid Empire|Persia]]n religious figure [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] listed Axum with [[Roman Empire|Rome]], Persia, and [[China]] as one of the four great powers of his time. The origins of the Axumite Kingdom are unclear, although experts have offered their speculations about it. Even who should be considered the earliest known king is contested: although [[Carlo Conti Rossini]] proposed that [[Zoskales]] of Axum, mentioned in the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'', should be identified with one Za Haqle mentioned in the Ethiopian King Lists (a view embraced by [[Ethiopian historiography|later historians of Ethiopia]] such as Yuri M. Kobishchanov<ref>Yuri M. Kobishchanov, ''Axum'', Joseph W. Michels, editor; Lorraine T. Kapitanoff, translator, (University Park, Pennsylvania: University of Pennsylvania, 1979), pp.54\u201359.</ref> and Sergew Hable Sellasie), [[G.W.B. Huntingford]] argued that Zoskales was only a sub-king whose authority was limited to [[Adulis]], and that Conti Rossini's identification can not be substantiated.<ref>Expressed, for example, in his ''The Historical Geography of Ethiopia'' (London: the British Academy, 1989), p.39.</ref>\n\nInscriptions have been found in southern [[Arabia]] celebrating victories over one [[GDRT]], described as \"''nagashi'' of [[Habesha people|Habashat]] [i.e. Abyssinia] and of Axum.\" Other dated inscriptions are used to determine a ''floruit'' for GDRT (interpreted as representing a Ge'ez name such as Gadarat, Gedur, Gadurat or Gedara) around the beginning of the 3rd century. A bronze scepter or wand has been discovered at Atsbi Dera with an inscription mentioning \"GDR of Axum\". Coins showing the royal portrait began to be minted under King [[Endubis]] toward the end of the 3rd century.\n[[File:Ousas.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Gold coin of the Aksumite King [[Ousas]]]]\nChristianity was introduced into the country by [[Saint Frumentius|Frumentius]] {{Citation needed|reason=What about the baptism of the Ethiopian eunuch?|date=March 2020}}, who was consecrated first bishop of Ethiopia by [[Athanasius of Alexandria|Saint Athanasius of Alexandria]] about 330. Frumentius converted [[Ezana of Axum|Ezana]], who left several inscriptions detailing his reign both before and after his conversion. One inscription found at Axum, states that he conquered the nation of the [[Bogos]], and returned thanks to his father, the god Mars, for his victory. Later inscriptions show Ezana's growing attachment to Christianity, and Ezana's coins bear this out, shifting from a design with disc and crescent to a design with a cross. Expeditions by Ezana into the [[Kingdom of Kush]] at [[Meroe]] in Sudan may have brought about its demise, though there is evidence that the kingdom was experiencing a period of decline beforehand. As a result of Ezana's expansions, Aksum bordered the Roman [[Aegyptus (Roman province)|province of Egypt]]. The degree of Ezana's control over Yemen is uncertain. Though there is little evidence supporting Aksumite control of the region at that time, his title, which includes ''king of Saba and Salhen, Himyar and Dhu-Raydan'' (all in modern-day Yemen), along with gold Aksumite coins with the inscriptions, \"king of the ''[[Habesha|Habshat]]''\" or \"Habashite\", indicate that Aksum might have retained some legal or actual footing in the area.<ref>Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p. 81.</ref>\n\nToward the close of the 5th century, a great company of monks known as the [[Nine Saints]] are believed to have established themselves in the country. Since that time, [[monasticism]] has been a power among the people, and not without its influence on the course of events.\n[[File:Ethio w3.jpg|thumb|right|250px|An Aksumite palace at [[Dungur]]]]\nThe Axumite Kingdom is recorded once again as controlling part &ndash; if not all &ndash; of Yemen in the 6th century. Around 523, the [[Jew]]ish king [[Dhu Nuwas]] came to power in Yemen and, announcing that he would kill all the Christians, attacked an Aksumite garrison at [[Zafar, Yemen|Zafar]], burning the city's churches. He then attacked the Christian stronghold of [[Najran]], slaughtering the Christians who would not convert. Emperor [[Justin I]] of the Eastern Roman empire requested that his fellow Christian, [[Kaleb of Axum|Kaleb]], help fight the Yemenite king, and around 525, Kaleb invaded and defeated Dhu Nuwas, appointing his Christian follower Sumuafa' Ashawa' as his viceroy. This dating is tentative, however, as the basis of the year 525 for the invasion is based on the death of the ruler of Yemen at the time, who very well could have been Kaleb's viceroy.  [[Procopius]] records that after about five years, [[Abraha]] deposed the viceroy and made himself king (''Histories'' 1.20). Despite several attempted invasions across the Red Sea, Kaleb was unable to dislodge Abreha, and acquiesced in the change; this was the last time Ethiopian armies left Africa until the 20th century. Eventually Kaleb abdicated in favor of his son [[W`ZB|Wa'zeb]] and retired to a monastery, where he ended his days. Abraha later made peace with Kaleb's successor and recognized his suzerainty. Despite this reverse, under Ezana and Kaleb the kingdom was at its height, benefiting from a large trade, which extended as far as [[India]] and Ceylon, and were in constant communication with the [[Byzantine Empire]].\n\nDetails of the Axumite Kingdom, never abundant, become even more scarce after this point. The last king known to mint coins is [[Armah]], whose coinage refers to the Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614. An early [[Muslim]] tradition is that the [[Negus]] [[Sahama]] offered asylum to a group of Muslims fleeing persecution during [[Muhammad]]'s life (615), but Stuart Munro-Hay believes that Axum had been abandoned as the capital by then<ref>Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', p.56.</ref> &ndash; although Kobishchanov states that Ethiopian raiders plagued the Red Sea, preying on Arabian ports at least as late as 702.<ref>Kobishchanov, ''Axum'', p.116.</ref>\n\nSome people believed the end of the Axumite Kingdom is as much of a mystery as its beginning. Lacking a detailed history, the kingdom's fall has been attributed to a persistent drought, overgrazing, deforestation, plague, a shift in trade routes that reduced the importance of the Red Sea\u2014or a combination of these factors. Munro-Hay cites the Muslim historian Abu Ja'far al-Khwarazmi/Kharazmi (who wrote before 833) as stating that the capital of \"the kingdom of Habash\" was Jarma. Unless Jarma is a nickname for Axum (hypothetically from Ge'ez ''girma'', \"remarkable, revered\"), the capital had moved from Axum to a new site, yet undiscovered.<ref>Stuart Munro-Hay, ''Aksum'', pp.95\u201398.</ref>\n\n==Middle Ages==\n\n===Zagwe Dynasty===\n{{main|Zagwe dynasty}}\n[[File:Gebre Mesqel Lalibela.png|thumb|upright|[[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]], the [[Zagwe dynasty]] King credited with having constructed the rock-hewn churches of [[Lalibela]].]]\nAbout 1000 (presumably c. 960, though the date is uncertain), a non-[[Christians|Christian]] princess, [[Gudit|Yodit]] (\"Gudit\", a play on Yodit meaning \"evil\"), conspired to murder all the members of the royal family and establish herself as monarch. According to legends, during the execution of the royals, an infant heir of the Axumite monarch was carted off by some faithful adherents and conveyed to [[Shewa]], where his authority was acknowledged. Concurrently, Yodit reigned for forty years over the rest of the kingdom and transmitted the crown to her descendants. Though parts of this story were most likely made up by the [[Solomonic Dynasty]] to legitimize its rule, it is known that a female ruler did conquer the country about this time.\n\nAt one point during the next century, the last of Yodit's successors were overthrown by an [[Agaw]] lord named [[Mara Takla Haymanot]], who founded the [[Zagwe dynasty]] (named after the [[Cushitic languages|Cushitic]] speaking Agaw who ruled during this time) and married a female descendant of the Aksumite monarchs (\"son-in-law\") or previous ruler. Exactly when the new dynasty came to power is unknown, as is the number of kings in the dynasty. The new Zagwe dynasty established its capital at Roha (also called Adeffa), where they build a series of [[monolithic church]]es. These structures are traditionally ascribed to the King [[Gebre Mesqel Lalibela]], with the city being renamed [[Lalibela]] in his honour; though in truth some of them were built before and after him. The architecture of the Zagwe shows a continuation of earlier Aksumite traditions, as can be seen at Lalibela and at [[Yemrehana Krestos Church]]. The building of rock-hewn churches, which first appeared in the late Aksumite era and continued into the Solomonic dynasty, reached its peak under the Zagwe.\n\nThe Zagwe dynasty controlled a smaller area than the Aksumites or the Solomonic dynasty, with its core in the Lasta region. The Zagwe seem to have ruled over a mostly peaceful state with a flourishing urban culture, in contrast to the more warlike Solomonids with their mobile capitals. David Buxton remarked that the Zagwe achieved 'a degree of stability and technical advancement seldom equalled in Abyssinian history'.

During this trip, the Ethiopian mission also travelled to France, Spain and Portugal in the hopes of building an alliance against the Muslim states then threatening Ethiopia's existence. Plans were even drawn up of a two-pronged invasion of Egypt with the French King, but nothing ever came of the talks, although this brought Ethiopia back to Europe's attention, leading to expansion of European influence when the Portuguese explorers reached the Indian Ocean.<ref>Pankhurst, Richard.

This legend was created to legitimize the Solomonic dynasty and was written down in the 14th century in the [[Kebra Negast]], an account of the origins of the Solomonic dynasty.\n\nUnder the Solomonic dynasty, the [[Subdivisions of Ethiopia|chief provinces]] became [[Tigray Province|Tigray]] (northern), what is now [[Amhara Province|Amhara]] (central) and [[Shewa]] (southern). The seat of government, or rather of overlordship, had usually been in Amhara or Shewa, the ruler of which, calling himself [[Emperor of Ethiopia|n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st]], exacted tribute, when he could, from the other provinces. The title of n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st was to a considerable extent based on their alleged direct descent from Solomon and the queen of Sheba; but it is needless to say that in many, if not in most, cases their success was due more to the force of their arms than to the purity of their [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]. Under the early Solomonic dynasty Ethiopia engaged in military reforms and imperial expansion which left it dominating the Horn of Africa, especially under the rule of [[Amda Seyon I]]. There was also great artistic and literary advancement at this time, but also a decline in urbanisation as the Solomonic emperors didn't have any fixed capital, but rather moved around the empire in mobile camps.\n\nUnder the early Solomonic dynasty monasticism grew strongly. The abbot Abba [[Ewostatewos]] created a new order called the Ewostathians who called for reforms in the church, including observance of the Sabbath, but was persecuted for his views and eventually forced into exile, eventually dying in Armenia. His zealous followers, also persecuted, formed isolated communities in Tigray. The movement grew strong enough that the emperor [[Dawit I]], after first trying to crush the movement, legalized their observance of the Sabbath and proselytization of their faith. Finally under [[Zara Yaqob]] a compromise was made between the new Egyptian bishops and the Ewostathians at the Council of Mitmaq in 1450, restoring unity to the Ethiopian church.<ref>{{cite book|last=Marcus|first=Harold|title=A History of Ethiopia|url=https://archive.org/details/historyofethiopi00marc|url-access=registration|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n====Relations with Europe and \"Prester John\"====\nAn interesting side-effect of Ethiopian Christianity was the way it intersected with a belief that had long prevailed in Europe of the existence of a Christian kingdom in the far east, whose monarch was known as [[Prester John]]. Originally thought to have been in the Orient, eventually the search for Prester John's mythical kingdom focused on Africa and particularly, the Christian empire in Ethiopia. This was first noticed when [[Zara Yaqob]] sent delegates to the Council of Florence in order to establish ties with the papacy and Western Christianity.<ref name=\"dacb\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/ethiopia/zarea_yaeqob.html|title=Zare'a Ya'eqob, Ethiopia, Orthodox|website=dacb.org|access-date=2017-01-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806234930/http://www.dacb.org/stories/ethiopia/zarea_yaeqob.html|archive-date=2016-08-06|url-status=dead}}</ref> They were confused when they arrived and council prelates insisted on calling their monarch [[Prester John]], trying to explain that nowhere in Zara Yaqob's list of regnal names did that title occur. However, the delegates' admonitions did little to stop Europeans from referring to the monarch as their mythical Christian king, Prester John.<ref>[[Robert Silverberg|Silverberg, Robert]], ''The Realm of Prester John'', [[Ohio University Press]], 1996 (paperback edition) {{ISBN|1-84212-409-9}}, p. 189</ref>\n\nTowards the close of the 15th century the Portuguese missions into Ethiopia began.  Among others engaged in this search was [[P\u00earo da Covilh\u00e3]], who arrived in Ethiopia in 1490, and, believing that he had at length reached the far-famed kingdom, presented to the n\u0259gus\u00e4 n\u00e4g\u00e4st of the country ([[Eskender]] at the time) a letter from his master the [[king of Portugal]], addressed to Prester John. Covilh\u00e3 would establish positive relations between the two states and go on to remain there for many years. In 1507, the Emperor sent an Armenian named [[Mateus (Ethiopia)|Matthew]] to the king of [[Portugal]] to request his aid against the Muslims. In 1520, the Portuguese fleet, with Matthew on board, entered the Red Sea in compliance with this request, and an embassy from the fleet visited the Emperor, [[Dawit II of Ethiopia|Lebna Dengel]], and remained in Ethiopia for about six years. One of this embassy was Father [[Francisco \u00c1lvares]], who wrote one of the earliest accounts of the country.<ref name=Britannica>{{cite book|last=Baynes|first=Thomas Spencer|title=The Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, and General Literature, Volume 1|year=1838|publisher=Henry G.

Entering, from the low country to the south-east, and overran much of the Ethiopian plateau, forcing the Emperor to take refuge in the mountain [[wiktionary:fastness|fastnesses]]. In this remote location, the ruler again turned to the Portuguese. Jo\u00e3o Bermudes, a subordinate member of the mission of 1520, who had remained in the country after the departure of the embassy, was sent to Lisbon. Bermudes claimed to be the ordained successor to the ''[[Abuna]]'' (archbishop), but his credentials are disputed.{{fact|date=February 2020}}\n\nIn response to Bermudes message, a Portuguese fleet under the command of [[Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama (16th century)|Est\u00eav\u00e3o da Gama]], was sent from India and arrived at [[Massawa]] in February 1541. Here he received an ambassador from the Emperor beseeching him to send help against the Muslims, and in the July following a force of 400 musketeers, under the command of [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Gama]], younger brother of the admiral, marched into the interior, and being joined by native troops were at first successful against the enemy; but they were subsequently defeated at the [[Battle of Wofla]] (28 August 1542), and their commander captured and executed. On February 21,1543, however, Al-Ghazi was shot and killed in the [[Battle of Wayna Daga]] and his forces were totally routed. After this, quarrels arose between the Emperor and Bermudes, who had returned to Ethiopia with Gama and now urged the emperor to publicly profess his obedience to Rome. This the Emperor refused to do, and at length Bermudes was obliged to make his way out of the country.<ref name=Britannica/>\n\n===Oromo Movements===\nThe '''Oromo migrations''' were a series of expansions in the 16th and 17th centuries by the [[Oromo people]] from southern areas of Ethiopia to more northern regions. The migrations had a severe impact on the [[Solomonic dynasty]] of Abyssinia, as well as being the death blow to the recently defeated [[Adal Sultanate]]. The migrations concluded in around 1710, when the Oromo conquered the kingdom of [[Ennarea]] in the [[Gibe region]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn the 17th century, Ethiopian emperor [[Susenyos I]] relied on Oromo support to gain power, and married an Oromo woman. While initial relations between the Oromo and Amhara were cordial, conflict erupted after the emperor tried to convert the Oromo to Christianity.<ref name=oromo>{{cite book|author=Marco Demichelis|title=Islamisation: Comparative Perspectives from History|chapter =THE OROMO AND THE HISTORICAL PROCESS OF ISLAMISATION IN ETHIOPIA|pages=223-243|publisher=Edinburgh University Press}}</ref> Many Oromo entered in emperor Susenyos' domain in response.<ref name=oromo/>\n\nIn the 17th and 18th centuries, much of the Oromo people gradually underwent conversion to Islam, especially around [[Harar]], [[Arsi Province|Arsi]] and [[Bale Province, Ethiopia|Bale]]. The Oromo Muslims regarded the Imam of [[Harar]] as their spiritual guide, while retaining some of their original culture and socio-political organisation. Scholars believe the Oromo converted to Islam as a means of preserving their identity and a bulwark against assimilation into Ethiopia.<ref name=oromo/>\n\nBy late 17th century, the Oromo had friendly relations with the Amharas. So when emperor [[Iyasu I]] tried to attack the Oromo, he was convinced by local Amharic rulers to back down. The Oromo also formed political coalitions with previously subdued people of Ethiopia, including the [[Sidama people]] and the locals of [[Ennarea]], [[Gibe (woreda)|Gibe]] and [[Kingdom of Damot]].<ref name=oromo/>\n\n==Gondarine Period==\nGondar as a third permanent capital (after ''Aksum'' and ''Lalibela'') of the Christian Kingdom was founded by Fasiladas in 1636.

In the beginning of the 17th century Father [[Pedro P\u00e1ez]] arrived at Fremona, a man of great tact and judgment, who soon rose into high favour at court, and won over the emperor to his faith. He directed the erection of churches, palaces and bridges in different parts of the country, and carried out many useful works. His successor [[Afonso Mendes]] was less tactful, and excited the feelings of the people against him and his fellow Europeans. Upon the death of Emperor [[Susenyos of Ethiopia|Susenyos]] and accession of his son [[Fasilides of Ethiopia|Fasilides]] in 1633, the Jesuits were expelled and the native religion restored to official status. Fasilides made [[Gondar]] his capital and built a castle there which would grow into the castle complex known as the [[Fasil Ghebbi]], or Royal Enclosure. Fasilides also constructed several churches in Gondar, many bridges across the country, and expanded the [[Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion]] in Aksum.\n\nDuring this time of religious strife [[Ethiopian philosophy]] flourished, and it was during this period that the philosophers [[Zera Yacob (philosopher)|Zera Yacob]] and [[Walda Heywat]] lived. Zera Yaqob is known for his treatise on religion, morality, and reason, known as [[Hatata]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Kiros|first=Teodoros|title=The Meditations of Zara Yaquob|url=http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Afri/AfriKiro.htm|accessdate=18 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121016192444/http://www.bu.edu/wcp/Papers/Afri/AfriKiro.htm|archive-date=16 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Aussa Sultanate====\n{{Main|Sultanate of Aussa|Mudaito Dynasty}}\n[[File:Red Red.svg|thumb|right|180px|State flag of the [[Aussa Sultanate]].]]\nThe [[Sultanate of Aussa]] (Afar Sultanate) succeeded the earlier [[Imamate of Aussa]]. The latter polity had come into existence in 1577, when [[Muhammed Jasa]] moved his capital from [[Harar]] to [[Asaita|Aussa]] with the split of the Adal Sultanate into Aussa and the Harari city-state. At some point after 1672, Aussa declined and temporarily came to an end in conjunction with Imam [[Umar Din bin Adam]]'s recorded ascension to the throne.<ref>Abir, p. 23 n.1.</ref>\n\nThe Sultanate was subsequently re-established by [[Kedafu]] around the year 1734, and was thereafter ruled by his [[Mudaito Dynasty]].<ref>Abir, pp. 23\u201326.</ref> The primary symbol of the Sultan was a silver [[Baton (symbol)|baton]], which was considered to have magical properties.<ref>Trimingham, p. 262.</ref>\n\n===Zemene Mesafint===\n{{main|Zemene Mesafint}}\nThis era was, on one hand, a religious conflict between settling Muslims and traditional Christians, between nationalities they represented, and, on the other hand, between feudal lords on power over the central government.\n\nSome historians date the murder of [[Iyasu I of Ethiopia|Iyasu I]], and the resultant decline in the prestige of the dynasty, as the beginning of the Ethiopian [[Zemene Mesafint]] (\"Era of the Princes\"), a time of disorder when the power of the monarchy was eclipsed by the power of local warlords.\n[[File:Early nineteenth century warriors Colour.jpg|thumb|left|Warriors in Abyssinia]]\nNobles came to abuse their positions by making emperors, and encroached upon the succession of the dynasty, by candidates among the nobility itself: e.g. on the death of [[Tewoflos of Ethiopia|Emperor Tewoflos]], the chief nobles of Ethiopia feared that the cycle of vengeance that had characterized the reigns of Tewoflos and [[Tekle Haymanot I of Ethiopia|Tekle Haymanot I]] would continue if a member of the Solomonic dynasty were picked for the throne, so they selected one of their own, [[Yostos of Ethiopia|Yostos]] to be ''negusa nagast'' (king of kings) \u2013 however his tenure was brief.\n\n[[Iyasu II]] ascended the throne as a child. His mother, [[Mentewab|Empress Mentewab]] played a major role in Iyasu's reign, as well as her grandson [[Iyoas I of Ethiopia|Iyoas]] too. Mentewab had herself crowned as co-ruler, becoming the first woman to be crowned in this manner in Ethiopian history.\n\nEmpress Mentewab was crowned co-ruler upon the succession of her son (a first for a woman in Ethiopia) in 1730, and held unprecedented power over government during his reign. Her attempt to continue in this role following the death of her son 1755 led her into conflict with Wubit (Welete Bersabe), his widow, who believed that it was her turn to preside at the court of her own son Iyoas. The conflict between these two queens led to Mentewab summoning her Kwaran relatives and their forces to Gondar to support her. Wubit responded by summoning her own [[Oromo people|Oromo]] relatives and their considerable forces from [[Yejju]].\n\nThe treasury of the Empire being allegedly penniless on the death of Iyasu, it suffered further from ethnic conflict between nationalities that had been part of the Empire for hundreds of years\u2014the Agaw, Amharans, Showans, and [[Tigray-Tigrinya people|Tigreans]]\u2014and the Oromo newcomers. Mentewab's attempt to strengthen ties between the monarchy and the Oromo by arranging the marriage of her son to the daughter of an Oromo chieftain backfired in the long run. Iyasu II gave precedence to his mother and allowed her every prerogative as a crowned co-ruler, while his wife Wubit suffered in obscurity. Wubit waited for the accession of her own son to make a bid for the power wielded for so long by Mentewab and her relatives from [[Qwara province|Qwara]]. When Iyoas assumed the throne upon his father's sudden death, the aristocrats of [[Gondar]] were stunned to find that he more readily spoke in the [[Oromo language]] rather than in [[Amharic language|Amharic]], and tended to favor his mother's Yejju relatives over the Qwarans of his grandmothers family. Iyoas further increased the favor given to the Oromo when adult. On the death of the Ras of Amhara, he attempted to promote his uncle Lubo governor of that province, but the outcry led his advisor [[Wolde Leul]] to convince him to change his mind.\n\nIt is believed that the power struggle between the Qwarans led by the Empress Mentewab, and the Yejju Oromos led by the Emperor's mother Wubit was about to erupt into an armed conflict. Ras [[Mikael Sehul]] was summoned to mediate between the two camps. He arrived and shrewdly maneuvered to sideline the two queens and their supporters making a bid for power for himself. Mikael settled soon as the leader of Amharic-Tigrean (Christian) camp of the struggle.\n\nThe reign of Iyaos' reign becomes a narrative of the struggle between the powerful Ras Mikael Sehul and the Oromo relatives of Iyoas. As Iyoas increasingly favored Oromo leaders like Fasil, his relations with Mikael Sehul deteriorated. Eventually Mikael Sehul deposed the Emperor Iyoas (7 May 1769). One week later, Mikael Sehul had him killed; although the details of his death are contradictory, the result was clear: for the first time an Emperor had lost his throne in a means other than his own natural death, death in battle, or voluntary abdication.\n\nMikael Sehul had compromised the power of the Emperor, and from this point forward it lay ever more openly in the hands of the great nobles and military commanders. This point of time has been regarded as one start of the Era of the Princes.\n\nAn aged and infirm imperial uncle prince was enthroned as Emperor [[Yohannes II of Ethiopia|Yohannes II]]. Ras Mikael soon had him murdered, and underage [[Tekle Haymanot II of Ethiopia|Tekle Haymanot II]] was elevated to the throne.\n\nThis bitter religious conflict contributed to hostility toward foreign Christians and Europeans, which persisted into the 20th century and was a factor in Ethiopia's isolation until the mid-19th century, when the first British mission, sent in 1805 to conclude an alliance with Ethiopia and obtain a port on the Red Sea in case [[France]] conquered Egypt. The success of this mission opened Ethiopia to many more travellers, missionaries and merchants of all countries, and the stream of Europeans continued until well into [[Tewodros II of Ethiopia|Tewodros]]'s reign.\n\nThis isolation was pierced by very few European travellers. One was the French physician [[Charles Jacques Poncet|C.J. Poncet]], who went there in 1698, via [[Kingdom of Sennar|Sennar]] and the Blue Nile. After him [[James Bruce]] entered the country in 1769, with the object of discovering the sources of the Nile, which he was convinced lay in Ethiopia. Accordingly, leaving Massawa in September 1769, he travelled via Axum to Gondar, where he was well received by Emperor Tekle Haymanot II. He accompanied the king on a warlike expedition round [[Lake Tana]], moving South round the eastern shore, crossing the Blue Nile ([[Abay River|Abay]]) close to its point of issue from the lake and returning via the western shore. Bruce subsequently returned to Egypt at the end of 1772 by way of the upper [[Atbara river|Atbara]], through the kingdom of Sennar, the Nile, and the [[Korosko desert]].\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:image241wiki.JPG|thumb|230px|The palace in Gondar]] -->\nDuring the 18th century the most prominent rulers were the emperor [[Dawit III of Ethiopia|Dawit III]] of Gondar (died May 18, 1721), [[Amha Iyasus]] of Shewa, who consolidated his kingdom and founded [[Ankober]], and [[Tekle Giyorgis I of Ethiopia|Tekle Giyorgis]] of Amhara \u2013 the last-mentioned is famous as having been elevated to the throne altogether six times and also deposed six times.

His father was a small local chief, and his relative (possibly uncle) ''Dejazmach'' [[Kinfu]] was governor of the provinces of [[Dembiya]], Qwara and [[Chelga]] between Lake Tana and the northwestern frontier. Kassa lost his inheritance upon the death of Kinfu while he was still a young boy. After receiving a traditional education in a local monastery, he went off to lead a band of bandits that roved the country in a Robin Hood-like existence. His exploits became widely known, and his band of followers grew steadily until he led a formidable army. He came to the notice of the ruling Regent, Ras Ali, and his mother Empress [[Menen Liben Amede]] (wife of the Emperor [[Yohannes III of Ethiopia|Yohannes III]]). In order to bind him to them, the Empress arranged for Kassa to marry Ali's daughter. He turned his attention to conquering the remaining [[Subdivisions of Ethiopia|chief divisions of the country]], Gojjam, Tigray and Shewa, which still remained unsubdued. His relations with his father-in-law and grandmother-in-law deteriorated however, and he soon took up arms against them and their vassals, and was successful.\n[[File:Abyssinia1891map excerpt2.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Map of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in the 19th century.]]\nOn February 11,1855, Kassa deposed the last of the Gondarine puppet Emperors, and was crowned ''negusa nagast'' of Ethiopia under the name of Tewodros II. He soon after advanced against Shewa with a large army. Chief of the notables opposing him was its king [[Haile Melekot]], a descendant of [[Meridazmach]] [[Asfa Wossen]]. Dissensions broke out among the Shewans, and after a desperate and futile attack on Tewodros at [[Dabra Berhan]], Haile Melekot died of illness, nominating with his last breath his eleven-year-old son as successor (November 1855) under the name Negus Sahle Maryam (the future emperor [[Menelek II]]). [[Darge Sahle Selassie|Darge]], Haile Melekot's brother, and Ato Bezabih, a Shewan noble, took charge of the young prince, but after a hard fight with Angeda, the Shewans were obliged to capitulate. Sahle Maryam was handed over to the Emperor Tewodoros and taken to Gondar. He was trained there in Tewodros's service, and then placed in comfortable detention at the fortress of [[Magdala, Ethiopia|Magdala]]. Tewodoros afterwards devoted himself to modernizing and centralizing the legal and [[Subdivisions of Ethiopia|administrative structure of his kingdom]], against the resistance of his governors. Sahle Maryam of Shewa was married to Tewodros II's daughter Alitash.\n\nIn 1865, Sahle Maryam escaped from Magdala, abandoning his wife, and arrived in Shewa, and was there acclaimed as [[Negus]]. Tewodros forged an alliance between Britain and Ethiopia, but as explained in the next section, he committed suicide after a military defeat by the British. On the death of Tewodros, many Shewans, including Ras Darge, were released, and the young Negus of Shewa began to feel himself strong enough, after a few preliminary minor campaigns, to undertake offensive operations against the northern princes. However, these projects were of little avail, for Ras Kassai of Tigray had by this time (1872) risen to supreme power in the north. Proclaiming himself ''negusa nagast'' under the name of Yohannes IV (or John IV), he forced Sahle Maryam to acknowledge his overlordship.\n\nIn early 1868, the British force seeking Tewodros\u2019 surrender, after he refused to release imprisoned British subjects, arrived on the coast of Massawa. The British and Dajazmach Kassa came to an agreement in which Kassa would let the British pass through Tigray (the British were going to Magdala which Tewodros had made his capital) in exchange for money and weapons. Surely enough, when the British completed their mission and were leaving the country, they rewarded Kassa for his cooperation with artillery, muskets, rifles, and munitions, all in all worth approximately \u00a3500,000.<ref>Marcus 2002, pp.&nbsp;71\u201372</ref> This formidable gift came in handy when in July 1871 the current emperor, Emperor Tekle Giyorgis II, attacked Kassa at his capital in Adwa, for Kassa had refused to be named a ras or pay tribute.<ref>Marcus, H. 2002, 72</ref> Although Kassa's army was outnumbered 12,000 to the emperor's 60,000, Kassa's army was equipped with more modern weapons and better trained. At battle's end, forty percent of the emperor's men had been captured. The emperor was imprisoned and would die a year later. Six months later on 21 January 1872, Kassa became the new emperor under the name Yohannes IV.<ref>Zewde, B. 2001, 43</ref>\n[[File:African Map in 1840.jpg|thumb|Abyssinia depicted on map before 1884 [[Berlin Conference]] to divide Africa.]]\n[[File:Menelik II - 4.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Menelik II]]]]\n\n==== Yohannes IV (1872\u20131889) ====\n{{main|British Expedition to Abyssinia|Battle of Adwa|Ethiopian\u2013Egyptian War}}\nEthiopia was never colonized by a European power, but was occupied by Italians in 1936 (see below); however, several colonial powers had interests and designs on Ethiopia in the context of the 19th-century \"[[Scramble for Africa]].\"<ref name=\"britannica.com\">[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Yohannes-IV Yohannes IV: emperor of Ethiopia]</ref>\n\nWhen [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Victoria]], Queen of the United Kingdom, in 1867 failed to answer a letter Tewodros II of Ethiopia had sent her, he took it as an insult and imprisoned several British residents, including the [[Consulate general|consul]].

The country's first important school of higher education, [[Addis Ababa University|University College of Addis Ababa]], was founded in 1950.  The [[1931 Constitution of Ethiopia|Constitution of 1931]] was replaced with the [[1955 Constitution of Ethiopia|1955 constitution]] which expanded the powers of the Parliament.  While improving diplomatic ties with the [[United States]], Haile Selassie also sought to improve the nation's relationship with other African nations.  To do this, in 1963, he helped to found the [[Organisation of African Unity]].\n\nIn 1961 the 30-year [[Eritrean War for Independence|Eritrean Struggle for Independence]] began, following the Ethiopian Emperor [[Haile Selassie I]]'s dissolution of the federation and shutting down the Eritrean parliament. The Emperor declared Eritrea the fourteenth province of Ethiopia in 1962.<ref>Semere Haile ''The Origins and Demise of the Ethiopia-Eritrea Federation'' Issue: A Journal of Opinion, Vol. 15, 1987 (1987), pp. 9\u201317</ref> The [[Negus]] suffered criticism due to the expenses involved in fighting the Nationalist forces.\n\nBy the early 1970s Emperor Haile Selassie's advanced age was becoming apparent. As Paul B. Henze explains:  \"Most Ethiopians thought in terms of personalities, not ideology, and out of long habit still looked to Haile Selassie as the initiator of change, the source of status and privilege, and the arbiter of demands for resources and attention among competing groups.\"<ref>Paul B. Henze, ''Layers of Time: A History of Ethiopia'' (New York: Palgrave, 2000), p. 282.</ref>  The nature of the succession, and of the desirability of the Imperial monarchy in general, were in dispute amongst the Ethiopian people.\n\nPerceptions of this war as imperialist were among the primary causes of the growing Ethiopian [[Marxist]] movement. In the early 1970s, the Ethiopian [[Communists]] received the support of the [[Soviet Union]] under the leadership of [[Leonid Brezhnev]]. This help led to the 1974 marxist coup of [[Mengistu]].\n\nThe government's failure to effect significant economic and political reforms over the previous fourteen years created a climate of unrest. Combined with rising inflation, corruption, a famine that affected several provinces (especially [[Welo]] and [[Tigray Province|Tigray]]) but was concealed from the outside world, and the growing discontent of urban interest groups, the country was ripe for revolution. The unrest that began in January 1974 became an outburst of general discontent. The Ethiopian military, with assistance from the [[Comintern]], began to both organize and incite a full-fledged revolution.<ref name=CountryStudy>{{cite book |title=A Country Study: Ethiopia |year=1991 |publisher=Federal Research Division, Library of Congress |location=Washington, D.C. |isbn=0-8444-0739-9 |url=https://archive.org/details/ethiopiacountrys00ofca |edition=4th |editor1=Thomas P.

The Derg summarily executed 59 members of the former government, including two former Prime Ministers and Crown Councilors, Court officials, ministers, and generals.

Before the coup, Ethiopian peasants' way of life was thoroughly influenced by the church teachings; 280 days a year are religious feasts or days of rest. Mengistu's years in office were marked by a totalitarian-style government and the country's massive militarization, financed by the [[Soviet Union]] and the Eastern Bloc, and assisted by [[Cuba]]. In December 1976, an Ethiopian delegation in [[Moscow]] signed a military assistance agreement with the Soviet Union. The following April 1977, Ethiopia abrogated its military assistance agreement with the United States and expelled the American military missions.\n\nThe new regime in Ethiopia met with armed resistance from the large landowners, the royalists and the nobility.<ref name=\"Martin Meredith p. 244\"/> The resistance was largely centered in the province of Eritrea.<ref>Martin Meredith, ''The Fate of Africa: A History of Fifty Years of Independence'', p. 245.</ref>  The Derg decided in November 1974 to pursue war in Eritrea rather than seek a negotiated settlement.

It was officially endorsed by 81% of voters, and in accordance with this new constitution, the country was renamed the [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia]] on September 10, 1987, and Mengistu became president.\n\nThe regime's collapse was hastened by droughts and [[1983\u201385 famine in Ethiopia|a famine]], which affected around 8 million people and left 1 million dead, as well as by insurrections, particularly in the northern regions of Tigray and Eritrea. The regime also conducted a brutal campaign of [[resettlement and villagization in Ethiopia]] in the 1980s. In 1989, the [[Tigrayan Peoples' Liberation Front]] (TPLF) merged with other ethnically based opposition movements to form the [[Ethiopian Peoples' Revolutionary Democratic Front]] (EPRDF). In May 1991, EPRDF forces advanced on Addis Ababa. Mengistu fled the country to asylum in [[Zimbabwe]], where he still resides.\n\nHundreds of thousands were killed due to the Red Terror, forced deportations, or from using hunger as a weapon.<ref name=BlackBook>{{cite book|title=The Black Book of Communism|year=1997|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-07608-2|pages=687\u2013695|editor=St\u00e9phane Courtois|title-link=The Black Book of Communism}}</ref> In 2006, after a long trial, Mengistu was found guilty of genocide.<ref name=GuiltyMengistu>{{cite news|title=Mengistu found guilty of genocide|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/6171429.stm|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=December 12, 2006}}</ref>\n\n=== Modern period (1991\u2013present) ===\nIn July 1991, the EPRDF, the [[Oromo Liberation Front]] (OLF), and others established the [[Transitional Government of Ethiopia]] (TGE), which was composed of an 87-member Council of Representatives and guided by a national charter that functioned as a transitional constitution. In June 1992, the OLF withdrew from the government; in March 1993, members of the [[Southern Ethiopia Peoples' Democratic Coalition]] also left the government.\n[[File:Flag of Ethiopia.svg|thumb|right|Flag of Ethiopia]]\nEritrea separated from Ethiopia following the fall of the Derg in 1991, after a long independentist war.\n\nIn 1994, a [[1995 Constitution of Ethiopia|new constitution]] was written that formed a bicameral legislature and a judicial system. A [[Ethiopian general election, 1995|general election in 1995]] to elect the Parliament also elected [[Meles Zenawi]] as prime minister and [[Negasso Gidada]] as president. Ethiopia's [[Ethiopian general election, 2000|second multiparty election]] was held in 2000 and Meles was re-elected as prime minister. In October 2001, Lieutenant [[Girma Wolde-Giorgis]] was elected president. In the [[Ethiopian general election, 2005|2005 general election]], allegations of irregularities that brought victory to the [[Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front]] resulted in widespread protests in which the government is accused of massacring civilians (see [[Ethiopian police massacres]]).\n\nWith the collapse of the Soviet Union, and with the rise of radical [[Islamism]], Ethiopia again turned to the Western powers for alliance and assistance. After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, the Ethiopian army began to train with US forces based out of the [[Combined Joint Task Force \u2013 Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) established in Djibouti, in [[counterterrorism]] and [[counterinsurgency]]. Ethiopia allowed the US to station military advisors at [[Camp Hurso]].<ref name=\"US-TRAINERS-PREPARE-ETHIOPIANS-TO-FIGHT\">{{cite news\n|url=http://stripes.com/article.asp?section=104&article=41429&archive=true\n|title=U.S. trainers prepare Ethiopians to fight\n|publisher=[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]\n|date=2006-12-30\n|accessdate=2007-01-14 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2006, an Islamic organisation seen by many as having ties with al-Qaeda, the [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU), [[Rise of the Islamic Courts Union|spread rapidly]] in Somalia. Ethiopia sent logistical support to the [[Transitional Federal Government]] opposing the Islamists. Finally, on December 20, 2006, active [[War in Somalia (2006\u201309)|fighting broke out]] between the ICU and Ethiopian Army. As the Islamist forces were of no match against the Ethiopian regular army, they decided to retreat and merge among the civilians, and most of the ICU-held Somalia was quickly taken. [[Human Rights Watch]] accused Ethiopia of various abuses including indiscriminate killing of civilians during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (March \u2013 April 2007)]]. Ethiopian forces pulled out of Somalia in January 2009, leaving a small African Union force and smaller Somali Transitional Government force to maintain the peace.

{"title_page": "Music of Oregon", "text_new": "{{Music of the United States}}\n[[Image:Woody Guthrie NYWTS.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Woody Guthrie]] wrote several songs about the Northwest under the commission of the [[Bonneville Power Administration]].]]\n\nThe '''music of Oregon''' reflects the diverse array of styles present in the [[music of the United States]], from [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] music to the contemporary genres of [[rock and roll]], [[country music|country]], [[rhythm and blues]], [[jazz]], [[pop music|pop]], [[electronic music]], and [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. However, throughout most of its history, the state has been relatively isolated from the cultural forces shaping American music. Much of modern [[popular music]] traces its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of [[African-American music|African American]] [[blues]] and the growth of [[gospel music]] in the 1920s. African American musicians borrowed elements of European and Indigenous musics to create new American forms. As Oregon's population was more homogeneous and more white than the United States as a whole, the state did not play a significant role in this history.\n\nThe state's main contributions to American popular music began in the 1960s, when [[The Kingsmen]] and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] established Oregon as a minor center of [[frat rock]] and [[garage rock]]. This led in one direction to the [[blues rock]] tradition of the [[Robert Cray Band]] and [[Curtis Salgado]], and in another direction to the [[hardcore punk]] scene of the early 1980s [[Pacific Northwest]], led by the [[Wipers]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and like-minded bands in [[Seattle]] and [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]]. Over the next twenty years, [[punk rock]] evolved into [[grunge]], [[riot grrrl]], [[alternative rock]], and, eventually, [[indie rock]]. In the last decade, Oregon has made a unique contribution to American [[independent music]], with a strong [[indie music scene]] developing in Portland. The city's reputation as a [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] mecca has paralleled the rise of local indie musicians such as [[The Decemberists]] (singer [[Colin Meloy]] attended the [[University of Oregon]]), [[Gossip (band)|Gossip]], [[The Dandy Warhols]], [[M. Ward]], [[Logan Lynn]], [[Storm Large]], [[Pink Martini]] and the late [[Elliott Smith]]. [[Floater (band)|Floater]] is Portland's leading example of an indie band. They have remained unsigned to a major label for over 20 years and have managed to be voted the best band of Portland for 2009 in addition to frequently selling out major venues like the [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] and the [[Aladdin Theater (Portland, Oregon)|Aladdin Theater]].<ref name=\"Jarman\">{{Cite news\n |last        = Jarman\n |first       = Casey\n |title       = Stone By Stone, An Elder Statesman Of NW Moss-Rock Reps Hard, With Or Without You.\n |newspaper   = [[Willamette Week]]\n |date        = 2008-03-26\n |url         = http://wweek.com/editorial/3420/10709/\n |accessdate  = 2009-06-29\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091121071707/http://wweek.com/editorial/3420/10709\n |archivedate = 2009-11-21\n}}</ref><ref name=\"PDXPOSED\">{{cite web\n  | title = \"Floater\" Rocks the Crystal Ballroom\n  | date = 2009-04-11\n  | url =http://vimeo.com/667265\n  |publisher = Vimeo.com\n  | accessdate =2009-06-29\n  | postscript =<!--None-->\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WATERHOUSE\">{{Cite news\n |last        = Waterhouse\n |first       = Ben\n |title       = 2009 Best of Portland Reader's Poll\n |newspaper   = [[Willamette Week]]\n |date        = 2009-04-11\n |url         = http://wweek.com/editorial/3537/12844/\n |publisher   = Wweek.com\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-23\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717143402/http://wweek.com/editorial/3537/12844/\n |archivedate = 2010-07-17\n}}</ref> Other prominent musicians have relocated to Portland, including [[Modest Mouse]] (of [[Seattle]]), [[Sleater-Kinney]] (of [[Olympia, Washington]]), [[The Shins]] (of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]), [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]] (of [[Austin, Texas]]),  former [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] leader [[Stephen Malkmus]] (of [[Stockton, California]]), singer songwriter [[Patterson Hood]] (of [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], and [[Athens, Georgia]]),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/a-southern-gentleman-in-the-old-northwest-patterso.html|title=A Southern Gentleman in the Old Northwest: Patterson Hood on Moving to Portland and Being Inescapably Southern|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}</ref> and former [[R.E.M.]] guitarist [[Peter Buck]] (of [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Athens, Georgia]]).<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/r-e-m-roar-back-with-collapse-into-now-20110207 |title= R.E.M.

[[Jam bands]] have a strong presence in the state, dating back to [[Grateful Dead]] performances at the [[Oregon Country Fair]], and outdoor [[music festival]]s continue to be popular. Portland's [[Waterfront Blues Festival]] is the second largest blues festival in the country. Prominent cultural institutions include the [[Oregon Bach Festival]], [[Oregon Festival of American Music]], [[Oregon Symphony]], and [[Mt. Hood Jazz Festival]].\n\n==Portland==\n===Pop Music===\nFrom the 1960s to the 1980s, some musical groups from Portland had occasional success on the pop charts.  [[The Kingsmen]] (singer [[Jack Ely]] died in Oregon) were the first to hit the top 10 with their 1960s garage rock classic \"[[Louie Louie]]\" peaking at #2, and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] gained popularity in Portland after relocating there from [[Idaho]].  [[The Hudson Brothers]] had several hits, such as \"Mr. Kirby\" (though originally this came when the group was named 'The New Yorkers'), \"So You Are a Star\" and even had their own eponymous TV show during the 1970s.  [[Quarterflash]] (which started out in the 1970s as a jazz band called 'Seafood Mama'), were led by the husband/wife duo Marv & Rindy Ross.  The band had several hits, including a platinum-selling #3 song \"Harden My Heart\" in 1981.  [[Nu Shooz]], also led by a husband/wife duo (John Smith & Valerie Day), also had several hits, their biggest also going to #3 \"[[I Can't Wait (Nu Shooz song)|I Can't Wait]]\" in 1986.<ref>{{cite news|author=Morgan Troper|title=So You Are A Star?

Katr. 5-29-08-->.  The [[Wipers]] and [[Poison Idea]] are the best known representatives of the scene, especially The Wipers, a major [[grunge]] influence.  These bands played at The Met (now [[Dante's]]) and the [[Satyricon (nightclub)|Satyricon]].  Other hardcore bands in the 1980s included [[Lockjaw (band)|Lockjaw]], [[Final Warning]], [[The Jackals]], and [[The Rats (American band)|The Rats]]. [[Hole (band)|Hole]] frontwoman [[Courtney Love]] spent time in Portland, and was active in the city's punk scene at the time.<ref>{{cite book|author=Brite, Poppy Z.|title=Courtney Love: The Real Story|year=1997|publisher=Simon & Schuster|pages=44\u201346|isbn=0-7528-1337-4}}</ref> She initially met [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]] frontman [[Kurt Cobain]] at the Satyricon club in 1989.\n\nIn the 1990s bands such as [[Defiance (punk band)|Defiance]], Resist, [[Bugskull]], Detestation, and [[Tragedy (band)|Tragedy]] rose in popularity. An important cult band from Portland was the [[Exploding Hearts]] of the early 2000s. [[Dead Moon]] developed a cult worldwide following with their garage-country punk, starting from the early 1990s.\n\n===Bluegrass and old-time===\nPortland is home to a thriving [[bluegrass music|bluegrass]] and [[old-time music]] scene. Popular Portland bands include [[Foghorn Stringband]], and [[The Water Tower Bucket Boys]]. Banjo player [[Tony Furtado]], who has branched out from traditional bluegrass music into [[progressive bluegrass]], jazz, and other genres, currently lives in Portland.  The Portland Old-Time Music Gathering takes place in mid-January each year, with a variety of Northwest musicians, jamming, and square dancing.  This event attracts a more diverse audience than is found at Old-Time events in the rest of the state.\n\n===World and world fusion===\nPortland is home to a thriving world music and international folk dancing scene<ref>http://www.musicfromtherow.com/home/top-10-music-cities-other-than-nashville</ref> including the [[Al-Andalus Ensemble]].

However, throughout most of its history, the state has been relatively isolated from the cultural forces shaping American music. Much of modern [[popular music]] traces its roots to the emergence in the late 19th century of [[African-American music|African American]] [[blues]] and the growth of [[gospel music]] in the 1920s. African American musicians borrowed elements of European and Indigenous musics to create new American forms. As Oregon's population was more homogeneous and more white than the United States as a whole, the state did not play a significant role in this history.\n\nThe state's main contributions to American popular music began in the 1960s, when [[The Kingsmen]] and [[Paul Revere & the Raiders]] established Oregon as a minor center of [[frat rock]] and [[garage rock]]. This led in one direction to the [[blues rock]] tradition of the [[Robert Cray Band]] and [[Curtis Salgado]], and in another direction to the [[hardcore punk]] scene of the early 1980s [[Pacific Northwest]], led by the [[Wipers]] in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] and like-minded bands in [[Seattle]] and [[Vancouver|Vancouver, BC]]. Over the next twenty years, [[punk rock]] evolved into [[grunge]], [[riot grrrl]], [[alternative rock]], and, eventually, [[indie rock]]. In the last decade, Oregon has made a unique contribution to American [[independent music]], with a strong [[indie music scene]] developing in Portland. The city's reputation as a [[hipster (contemporary subculture)|hipster]] mecca has paralleled the rise of local indie musicians such as [[The Decemberists]] (singer [[Colin Meloy]] attended the [[University of Oregon]]), [[Gossip (band)|Gossip]], [[The Dandy Warhols]], [[M. Ward]], [[Logan Lynn]], [[Storm Large]], [[Pink Martini]] and the late [[Elliott Smith]]. [[Floater (band)|Floater]] is Portland's leading example of an indie band. They have remained unsigned to a major label for over 20 years and have managed to be voted the best band of Portland for 2009 in addition to frequently selling out major venues like the [[Crystal Ballroom (Portland, Oregon)|Crystal Ballroom]] and the [[Aladdin Theater (Portland, Oregon)|Aladdin Theater]].<ref name=\"Jarman\">{{Cite news\n |last        = Jarman\n |first       = Casey\n |title       = Stone By Stone, An Elder Statesman Of NW Moss-Rock Reps Hard, With Or Without You.\n |newspaper   = [[Willamette Week]]\n |date        = 2008-03-26\n |url         = http://wweek.com/editorial/3420/10709/\n |accessdate  = 2009-06-29\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20091121071707/http://wweek.com/editorial/3420/10709\n |archivedate = 2009-11-21\n}}</ref><ref name=\"PDXPOSED\">{{cite web\n  | title = \"Floater\" Rocks the Crystal Ballroom\n  | date = 2009-04-11\n  | url =http://vimeo.com/667265\n  |publisher = Vimeo.com\n  | accessdate =2009-06-29\n  | postscript =<!--None-->\n}}</ref><ref name=\"WATERHOUSE\">{{Cite news\n |last        = Waterhouse\n |first       = Ben\n |title       = 2009 Best of Portland Reader's Poll\n |newspaper   = [[Willamette Week]]\n |date        = 2009-04-11\n |url         = http://wweek.com/editorial/3537/12844/\n |publisher   = Wweek.com\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-23\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717143402/http://wweek.com/editorial/3537/12844/\n |archivedate = 2010-07-17\n}}</ref> Other prominent musicians have relocated to Portland, including [[Modest Mouse]] (of [[Seattle]]), [[Sleater-Kinney]] (of [[Olympia, Washington]]), [[The Shins]] (of [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]), [[Spoon (band)|Spoon]] (of [[Austin, Texas]]),  former [[Pavement (band)|Pavement]] leader [[Stephen Malkmus]] (of [[Stockton, California]]), singer songwriter [[Patterson Hood]] (of [[Muscle Shoals, Alabama]], and [[Athens, Georgia]]),<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/07/a-southern-gentleman-in-the-old-northwest-patterso.html|title=A Southern Gentleman in the Old Northwest: Patterson Hood on Moving to Portland and Being Inescapably Southern|work=pastemagazine.com|access-date=2018-08-10|language=en}}</ref> and former [[R.E.M.]] guitarist [[Peter Buck]] (of [[Berkeley, California]] and [[Athens, Georgia]]).<ref>{{cite journal |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/r-e-m-roar-back-with-collapse-into-now-20110207 |title= R.E.M.

The [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Tartu Peace Treaty]] (February 1920) marked the end of fighting and recognised Estonian independence in perpetuity.\n\nIn 1940, in the wake of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] occupied Estonia and (according to e.g. the US,<ref name=\"USA\">{{Cite web|url = https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/86539.htm |title= U.S.-Baltic Relations: Celebrating 85 Years of Friendship |last= Fried|first= Daniel|date= 14 June 2007|publisher= U.S. State Department}}</ref> the EU,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+MOTION+B6-2007-0215+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN|title= Motion for a resolution on the Situation in Estonia|date= 21 May 2007|publisher= European Parliament|accessdate= 2009-09-19}}</ref> and the [[European Court of Human Rights]]{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}) illegally annexed the country.

Estonia regained independence in 1991 in the course of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and joined the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]] in 2004.\n\n==Ancient Estonia: pre-history==\n{{Main|Ancient Estonia}}\n\n===Mesolithic Period===\n[[File:KundaCultureTools.jpg|thumb|Tools made by [[Kunda culture]], the Estonian History Museum]]\nThe region has been populated since the end of the [[Quaternary glaciation|Late Pleistocene Ice Age]], about 10,000 BC. The earliest traces of human settlement in Estonia are connected with the [[Kunda culture]]. The early [[mesolithic]] [[Pulli settlement]] is located by the [[P\u00e4rnu]] River. It has been dated to the beginning of the 9th millennium BC. The Kunda culture received its name from the [[Kunda, Estonia|''Lammasm\u00e4e'']] settlement site in northern Estonia, which dates from earlier than 8500 BC.<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|p=24}}</ref> Bone and stone artifacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in [[Latvia]], northern [[Lithuania]] and southern [[Finland]]. Among minerals, [[flint]] and [[quartz]] were used the most for making cutting tools.\n\n===Neolithic Period===\nThe beginning of the [[Neolithic Period]] is marked by the [[ceramics]] of the Narva culture, and appear in Estonia at the beginning of the 5th millennium. The oldest finds date from around 4900 BC. The first pottery was made of thick clay mixed with pebbles, shells or plants. The Narva-type ceramics are found throughout almost the entire Estonian coastal region and on the islands. The stone and bone tools of the era have a notable similarity with the artifacts of the Kunda culture.\n[[File:CombCeramicPottery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture|Comb Ceramic]] pottery at the Estonian History Museum]]\nAround the beginning of 4th millennium BC [[Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture|Comb Ceramic culture]] arrived in Estonia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|M\u00e4esalu|Lukas|Laur|Tannberg|2004|p=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Until the early 1980s the arrival of [[Balto-Finnic peoples]], the ancestors of the Estonians, Finns, and Livonians, on the shores of the [[Baltic Sea]] was associated with the Comb Ceramic Culture.<ref>{{Cite book\n| last1 = Minahan\n| first1 = James\n| title = Miniature Empires: A historical dictionary of the newly independent states\n| year = 1998\n| publisher = [[Greenwood Press]]\n| location = Westport, Connecticut\n| isbn = 0-313-30610-9\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=RSxt-JB-PDkC&pg=PA153\n| page = 153\n}}</ref> However, such a linking of archaeologically defined cultural entities with linguistic ones cannot be proven, and it has been suggested that the increase of settlement finds in the period is more likely to have been associated with an economic boom related to the warming of climate.

The development of the borders between the [[Balto-Finnic peoples|Finnic peoples]] and the [[Balts]] was under way. The first fortified settlements, Asva and Ridala on the island of [[Saaremaa]] and Iru in Northern Estonia, began to be built. The development of shipbuilding facilitated the spread of bronze. Changes took place in burial customs, a new type of burial ground spread from Germanic to Estonian areas, and stone [[cist]] graves and cremation burials became increasingly common, alongside a small number of boat-shaped stone graves.<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|p=26}}</ref>\n\nAbout the 7th century BC, a large meteorite hit [[Saaremaa]] island and created the [[Kaali crater]]s.\n\nAbout 325 BC, the Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] possibly visited Estonia.

The oldest iron items were imported, although since the 1st century iron was [[smelting|smelted]] from local marsh and lake ore. Settlement sites were located mostly in places that offered natural protection. Fortresses were built, although used temporarily. The appearance of square [[Celtic field]]s surrounded by enclosures in Estonia date from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The majority of stones with man-made indents, which presumably were connected with magic designed to increase crop fertility, date from this period. A new type of grave, quadrangular burial mounds, began to develop. Burial traditions show the clear beginning of [[social stratification]].\n\nThis period saw a single Siberian Y-DNA haplogroup making up half of male lineages in Estonia.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190512050452/https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)30424-5</ref>\n\nThe [[Roman Iron Age]] in Estonia is roughly dated to between 50 and 450 AD, the era that was affected by the influence of the [[Roman Empire]]. In material culture this is reflected by a few Roman coins, some jewellery and artefacts. The abundance of iron artefacts in Southern Estonia speaks of closer mainland ties with southern areas, while the islands of western and northern Estonia communicated with their neighbors mainly by sea. By the end of the period three clearly defined tribal dialectical areas\u2014Northern Estonia, Southern Estonia, and Western Estonia including the islands\u2014had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|pp=28\u201331}}</ref>\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n[[File:Europe 814.svg|thumb|Europe in the 9th century]]\n\nThe name \"Estonia\" occurs first in a form of [[Aestii]] in the 1st century AD by [[Tacitus]]; however, it might have indicated Baltic tribes living in the area.

The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major counties had developed in Estonia: [[Saare County|Saaremaa]] (Osilia), [[L\u00e4\u00e4nemaa]] (Rotalia or Maritima), [[Harjumaa (ancient county)|Harjumaa]] (Harria), [[R\u00e4vala]] (Revalia), [[Virumaa]] (Vironia), [[J\u00e4rvamaa]] (Jervia), [[Sakala County|Sakala]] (Saccala), and [[Ugandi County|Ugandi]] (Ugaunia).<ref name=\"estonia_and_the_estonians\">{{Cite book\n| last1 = Raun\n| first1 = Toivo U.\n| title = Estonia and the Estonians\n| year = 2001\n| publisher = [[Hoover Institution Press]], Stanford University\n| location = Stanford, California\n| isbn = 0-8179-2852-9\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YQ1NRJlUrwkC&pg=PA11\n| page = 11\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Varbola Stronghold]] was one of the largest circular rampart fortresses and trading centers built in Estonia, [[Harju County]] ({{lang-la|Harria}}) at the time.\n\nIn the 11th century the Scandinavians are frequently chronicled as combating the [[Vikings]] from the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea.\nWith the rise of Christianity, centralized authority in Scandinavia and Germany eventually led to the [[Baltic crusades]].\nThe east Baltic world was transformed by military conquest: first the [[Livs]], [[Latvians|Letts]] and [[Estonians]], then the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] and the [[Finns]] underwent defeat, [[baptism]], [[military occupation]] and sometimes extermination by groups of Germans, Danes and Swedes.<ref name=\"the_northern_crusades\">{{Cite book\n| last1 = Christiansen\n| first1 = Eric\n| title = The Northern Crusades\n| edition = 2nd\n| year = 1997\n| publisher = [[Penguin Group|Penguin]]\n| location = London, England\n| isbn = 0-14-026653-4\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/northerncrusades00eric/page/93 93]\n| url = https://archive.org/details/northerncrusades00eric/page/93\n}}</ref>\n\n==Estonian Crusade: The Middle Ages==<!-- This section is linked from [[Estonian language]] -->\n[[File:Ancient Estonian counties.png|thumb|200px|left|[[Ancient Estonia]] until 21 September 1217]]\n[[File:Danmarks flag 1219 Lorentzen.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] falling from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]], 1219]]\n{{Main|Livonian Crusade}}\n\nEstonia was one of the last corners of medieval Europe to be [[Christianity|Christianized]]. In 1193 [[Pope Celestine III]] called for a crusade against [[paganism|pagan]]s in Northern Europe. The [[Northern Crusades]] from Northern Germany established the stronghold of [[Riga]] (in modern Latvia). With the help of the newly converted local tribes of [[Livonians|Livs]] and [[Latvians|Letts]], the crusaders initiated raids into part of what is present-day Estonia in 1208. Estonian tribes fiercely resisted the attacks from Riga and occasionally themselves sacked territories controlled by the crusaders. In 1217 the German crusading order the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Sword Brethren]] and their recently converted allies won a major battle in which the Estonian commander [[Lembitu]] was killed. The period of the several Northern Crusade battles in Estonia between 1208 and 1227 is also known as the period of the ancient Estonian fight for independence.\n\n==Danish Estonia==\n{{Main|Danish Estonia}}\n[[File:Medieval Livonia 1260.svg|left|150px|thumb|[[Livonia]] in 1260]]\nNorthern Estonia was conquered by Danish crusaders led by king [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Waldemar II]], who arrived in 1219 on the site of the Estonian town of Lindanisse<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/7/0518.html|title=Salmonsens konversationsleksikon / 2/7|publisher=[[Project Runeberg]]|language=Danish|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> (now [[Tallinn]]) at (Latin) ''Revelia'' (Estonian) ''Revala'' or ''[[R\u00e4vala]]'', the adjacent ancient Estonian county.

The province was occupied by the [[Livonian Order]] as a result. In 1346, the Danish dominions in Estonia ([[Harria]] and [[Vironia]]) were sold for 10&nbsp;000 [[mark (unit)|marks]] to the [[Livonian Order]].\n\n===Swedish coastal settlements===\nThe first written mention of the [[Estonian Swedes]] comes from 1294, in the laws of the town of [[Haapsalu]]. Estonian Swedes are one of the earliest known minorities in Estonia. They have also been called \"Coastal Swedes\" (''Rannarootslased'' in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]), or according to their settlement area [[Ruhnu]] Swedes, Hiiu Swedes etc. They themselves used the expression ''aibofolke'' (\"island people\"), and called their homeland ''[[Aiboland]]''.\n\nThe ancient areas of Swedish settlement in Estonia were Ruhnu Island, [[Hiiumaa]] Island, the west coast and smaller islands ([[Vormsi]], [[Noarootsi]], Sutlepa, Riguldi, [[Osmussaar]]), the northwest coast of the Harju District ([[N\u00f5va Parish|N\u00f5va]], [[Vihterpalu]], [[Kurkse]], the [[Pakri Peninsula]] and the [[Pakri Islands]]), and [[Naissaar]] Island near Tallinn. The towns with a significant percentage of Swedish population have been [[Haapsalu]] and Tallinn.\n\nIn earlier times Swedes also lived on the coasts of Saaremaa, the southern part of [[L\u00e4\u00e4nemaa]], the eastern part of [[Harjumaa]] and the western part of [[Virumaa]].\n\n==Terra Mariana==\n{{Main|Terra Mariana}}\n[[File:Narva Hermanni kindlus, 21. juuli 2011.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Hermann castle, Narva|[[Hermann Castle]], Narva, was one of the Teutonic Order's castles in Estonia.]]\nIn 1227 the Sword Brethren conquered the last indigenous stronghold on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].

The northern part of Estonia \u2013 more exactly Harjumaa and Virumaa districts (in German: Harrien und Wierland) \u2013 was a nominal possession of [[Denmark]] until 1346. [[Tallinn]] (Reval) was given the [[L\u00fcbeck law|L\u00fcbeck Rights]] in 1248 and joined the [[Hanseatic League]] at the end of the 13th century. In 1343 the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa (Oesel) Island started a rebellion ([[St. George's Night Uprising]]) against the rule of their German-speaking landlords. The uprising was put down, and four elected Estonian \"kings\" were killed in [[Paide]] during peace negotiations in 1343.

The Reformation in Estonia was inspired and organized by local and Swedish secular and religious authorities \u2013 especially after the end of the Livonian War in 1582. [[Lutheranism]] spread literacy among the young, and it transformed religious art. However, the peasants were traditionalists and were more comfortable with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] traditions; they delayed the adoption of the new religion. After 1600, Swedish Lutheranism began to dominate the building, furnishing, and (modest) decoration of new churches. Church architecture was now designed to encourage congregational understanding of and involvement in the services. Pews and seats were installed for the common people to make listening to the sermon less of a burden, and altars often featured depictions of the [[Last Supper]], but images and statues of the [[list of saints|saints]] had disappeared.<ref>Krista Kodres, \"Church and art in the First Century of the reformation in Estonia: Towards Lutheran orthodoxy,\" ''Scandinavian Journal of History'' (2003) 28#3 pp 187\u2013203. online</ref> The [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German elite]] promoted Lutheranism, and language, education, religion and politics were greatly transformed.

In 1625, mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule. Estonia was administratively divided between the provinces of [[Duchy of Estonia (1561\u20131721)|Estonia]] in the north and [[Livonia]] in southern Estonia and northern Latvia, a division which persisted until the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] asked for help of [[Gustav I of Sweden]], and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] also began direct negotiations with Gustavus, but nothing resulted because on 29 September 1560, Gustavus I Vasa died. The chances for success of [[Magnus von Lyffland]] and his supporters looked particularly good in 1560 and 1570. In the former case he had been recognised as their [[Monarch|sovereign]] by the [[Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek]] and the [[Bishopric of Courland]], and as their prospective ruler by the authorities of the [[Bishopric of Dorpat]]; the [[Bishopric of Reval]] with the [[Harrien]]-[[Wierland]] [[gentry]] were on his side; and the [[Livonian Order]] conditionally recognised his right of ownership of the principality of Estonia. Then, along with [[Archbishop]] [[Wilhelm von Brandenburg]] of the [[Archbishopric of Riga]] and his [[Coadjutor archbishop|coadjutor]] [[Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg|Christoph von Mecklenburg]], Kettler gave to Magnus the portions of the [[Kingdom of Livonia]] which he had taken possession of, but they refused to give him any more land. Once [[Eric XIV of Sweden]] became king, he took quick actions to get involved in the war. He negotiated a continued peace with [[Muscovy]] and spoke to the [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s of [[Reval]] city. He offered them goods to submit to him, as well as threatening them. By 6 June 1561, they submitted to him, contrary to the persuasions of Kettler to the burghers. The King's brother Johan married the Polish princess [[Catherine Jagiellon]]. Wanting to obtain his own land in Livonia, he loaned Poland money and then claimed the castles they had pawned as his own instead of using them to pressure Poland. After Johan returned to [[Finland]], Erik XIV forbade him to deal with any foreign countries without his consent. Shortly after that Erik XIV started acting quickly and lost any allies he was about to obtain, either from Magnus or the Archbishop of [[Riga]]. Magnus was upset he had been tricked out of his [[inheritance]] of [[Holstein]]. After Sweden [[military occupation|occupied]] Reval, [[Frederick II of Denmark]] made a treaty with Erik XIV of Sweden in August 1561. The brothers were in great disagreement, and Frederick II negotiated a treaty with Ivan IV on 7 August 1562, in order to help his brother obtain more land and stall further Swedish advance. Erik XIV did not like this and the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] between the [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck]], Denmark, Poland, and Sweden broke out. While only losing land and trade, Frederick II and Magnus were not faring well. But in 1568, Erik XIV became [[insane]], and his brother Johan III took his place. Johan III ascended to the throne of Sweden, and due to his friendship with Poland he began a policy against Muscovy. He would try to obtain more land in Livonia and exercise strength over Denmark. After all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], know that he was ready for peace. On 13 December 1570, the [[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Treaty of Stettin]] was concluded. It is, however, more difficult to estimate the scope and magnitude of the support Magnus received in Livonian cities. Compared to the Harrien-Wierland gentry, the Reval city council, and hence probably the majority of citizens, demonstrated a much more reserved attitude towards Denmark and King Magnus of Livonia. Nevertheless, there is no reason to speak about any strong pro-Swedish sentiments among the residents of Reval. The citizens who had fled to the Bishopric of Dorpat or had been deported to Muscovy hailed Magnus as their saviour until 1571. The analysis indicates that during the [[Livonian War]] a pro-independence wing emerged among the Livonian gentry and townspeople, forming the so-called \"Peace Party\". Dismissing hostilities, these forces perceived an agreement with Muscovy as a chance to escape the atrocities of war and avoid the division of Livonia. That is why Magnus, who represented Denmark and later struck a deal with [[Ivan the Terrible]], proved a suitable figurehead for this faction.\n\n[[File:Livland 15jh.png|right|350px|thumb|Livonia, as shown in the map of 1573 of Joann Portantius]]\n\nThe Peace Party, however, had its own armed forces \u2013 scattered bands of household troops (''Hofleute'') under diverse command, which only united in action in 1565 ([[Battle of P\u00e4rnu]] and [[Siege of Reval, 1565]]), in 1570\u20131571 ([[Siege of Reval, 1570\u20131571]]; 30 weeks), and in 1574\u20131576 (first on Sweden's side, then came the sale of [[L\u00e4\u00e4ne County|Wiek]] to the [[monarchy of Denmark|Danish Crown]] and the loss of the territory to the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovites]]). In 1575 after Muscovy attacked Danish claims in Livonia, Frederick II dropped out of the competition, as did the Holy Roman Emperor. After this Johan III held off on his pursuit for more land due to Muscovy obtaining lands that Sweden controlled. He used the next two years of truce to get in a better position. In 1578, he resumed the fight for not only Livonia, but also everywhere due to an understanding he made with [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Rzeczpospolita]]. In 1578 Magnus retired to Rzeczpospolita, and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.\n\nHaving rejected peace proposals from its enemies, [[Ivan the Terrible]] found himself in a difficult position by 1579, when the [[Crimean Khanate]] devastated Muscovian territories and burnt down Moscow (see [[Russo-Crimean Wars]]), the drought and epidemics had fatally affected the economy, the policy of [[oprichnina]] had thoroughly disrupted the government, while the [[Grand Principality of Lithuania]] [[Union of Lublin|had united with]] the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and acquired an energetic leader, [[Stefan Batory]], supported by the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1576). Batory replied with a series of three [[offensive (military)|offensive]]s against Muscovy, trying to cut the [[Kingdom of Livonia]] from Muscovian territories. During his first offensive in 1579 with 22,000 men he retook [[Polotsk]]. During the second, in 1580, with a 29,000-strong army he took [[Wielkie \u0141uki|Velikie Luki]], and in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army he started the [[Siege of Pskov]]. Frederick II had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy unlike [[Sweden]] and Poland. He came to an agreement with [[John III of Sweden]] in 1580 giving him the titles in Livonia. That war would last from 1577 to 1582. Muscovy recognized Polish\u2013Lithuanian control of [[Ducatus Ultradunensis]] only in 1582. After [[Magnus von Lyffland]] died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the [[Duchy of Courland]] and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of [[\u0152sel]], [[Denmark]] was out of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] by 1585. In 1598 [[Duchy of Livonia|Polish Livonia]] was divided into:\n* [[Wenden Voivodeship]] (''wojew\u00f3dztwo wende\u0144skie'', [[Kie\u015b]])\n* [[Dorpat Voivodeship]] (''wojew\u00f3dztwo dorpackie'', [[Dorpat]])\n* [[Parnawa Voivodeship]] (''wojew\u00f3dztwo parnawskie'', [[Parnawa]])\n\n==Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth==\n{{Main|Duchy of Livonia}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita2nar.png|thumb|left|left|150x|Outline of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\n[[File:sweden2.gif|thumb|right|120px|Formation of the Swedish Empire, 1560\u20131660]]\nDuring 1582\u201383 southern Estonia ([[Livonia]]) became part of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].\n\n==Estonia in the Swedish Empire==\n{{Main|Swedish Estonia}}\nThe [[Duchy of Estonia (1561\u20131721)|Duchy of Estonia]] placed itself under Swedish rule in 1561 to receive protection against [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russia]] and [[Poland]] as the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Order]] lost their foothold in the Baltic provinces. Territorially it represented the northern part of present-day Estonia.\n\n[[Swedish Livonia|Livonia]] was conquered from the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] by 1629 in the [[Polish\u2013Swedish War (1626\u201329)|Polish\u2013Swedish War]]. By the [[Treaty of Oliva]] between the Commonwealth and Sweden in 1660 following the [[Northern Wars]] the [[House of Vasa|Polish\u2013Lithuanian king]] renounced all claims to the Swedish throne and Livonia was formally ceded to Sweden. Swedish Livonia represents the southern part of present-day Estonia and the northern part of present-day [[Latvia]] ([[Vidzeme]] region).\n\nIn 1631, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden]] forced the nobility to grant the peasantry greater [[autonomy]], and in 1632 established a [[printing press]] and [[University of Tartu|university]] in the city of [[Tartu]].\n\n==Estonia in the Russian Empire (1710\u20131917)==\n[[File:Europa1899.JPG|150px|thumb|Europe in 19th century]]\n\nSweden's defeat by Russia in the [[Great Northern War]] resulted in the [[capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] in 1710, confirmed by the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721, and Russian rule was then imposed on what later became modern Estonia. Nonetheless, the legal system, [[Lutheran]] church, local and town governments, and education remained mostly German until the late 19th century and partially until 1918.\n\nThe Russian era from the 1720s to the [[First World War]] was the golden age of the German elites. They owned most of the land and businesses, controlled the [[serfs]], dominated all the cities, and got along quite well with the Russian imperial authorities.  Unrest and rebellion was uncommon. The Germans were Lutherans, and so were the vast majority of the Estonian population, but the Germans had full control of the Lutheran churches. [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] Protestant missionaries made an impact in the eighteenth century, and translated the complete Bible into Estonian. The Germans complained, so the imperial government banned the Moravians from 1743 to 1764. A theological faculty opened at the [[University of Dorpat]] (Tartu), with German professors. The local German gentry controlled the local churches and rarely hired Estonian graduates, but they made their mark as intellectuals and Estonian nationalists. In the 1840s, there was a movement of Lutheran peasants into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The [[tsardom of Russia|czar]] discouraged them when he realized they were challenging the local authorities.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age'' (195) 197\u201398</ref> The German character of the Lutheran churches alienated many nationalists, who emphasized the secular in their subcultures. For example, [[choral societies]] offered a secular alternative to church music.<ref>Hank Johnston, \"Religion and Nationalist Subcultures in the Baltics,\" ''[[Journal of Baltic Studies]]'' (1992) 23#2 pp 133\u2013148.</ref>\n \n[[File:Album von Dorpat, TKM 0031H 05, crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[University of Tartu|Tartu University]] (Universit\u00e4t Dorpat) in 1860, during its 'Golden Age']]\n\nBy 1819, the [[Baltic provinces]] were the first in the Russian empire in which serfdom was abolished, the largely autonomous nobility allowing the peasants to own their own land or move to the cities. These moves created the economic foundation for the coming to life of the local national identity and culture as Estonia was caught in a current of national awakening that began sweeping through Europe in the mid-19th century.\n\nTartu was a multicultural crossroads with strong representation of Russians, Germans and Estonians. Orthodox, Lutherans and [[Jews]], scientists and humanists, all were quite active at the city's [[University of Tartu|university]]. The students seemed uninterested in the [[Russification]] programs introduced in the 1890s.<ref>{{cite book| author=Neil Taylor| title=Baltic Cities| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNsH-uJkUekC&pg=PA84| year=2008| publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] | pages=84\u201385}}</ref>\n\n===The Estophile enlightenment period (1750\u20131840)===\n{{Main|Estophilia}}\n\nEducated German immigrants and local [[Baltic Germans]] in Estonia, educated at German universities, introduced [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] of rational thinking, ideas that propagated freedom of thinking and brotherhood and equality.

Although Baltic Germans by and large regarded the future of the Estonians as being a fusion with the Baltic Germans, the Estophile educated class admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|p=84}}</ref> The Estophile Enlightenment Period formed the transition from religious Estonian literature to newspapers written in Estonian for the mass public.\n\n===National awakening===\n{{Main|Estonian national awakening}}\nA cultural movement sprang forth to adopt the use of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as the language of instruction in schools, all-Estonian song festivals were held regularly after 1869, and a national literature in Estonian developed. ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'', Estonia's national epic, was published in 1861 in both Estonian and German.\n\n1889 marked the beginning of the central government-sponsored policy of [[Russification]]. The impact of this was that many of the [[Baltic German]] legal institutions were either abolished or had to do their work in Russian \u2013 a good example of this is the [[University of Tartu]].\n\nAs the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] swept through Estonia, the Estonians called for [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], for universal [[suffrage|franchise]], and for national autonomy. Estonian gains were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.\n\n==Road to the republic (1917\u20131920)==\n{{Main|Diplomatic history of World War I#Three Baltic states|Autonomous Governorate of Estonia|Commune of the Working People of Estonia}}\n[[File:Estonian Declaration of Independence.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Estonian Declaration of Independence]]]]\nEstonia as a unified political entity first emerged after the Russian [[February Revolution]] of 1917. With the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in [[World War I]], [[Russian Provisional Government|Russia's Provisional Government]] granted national autonomy to a [[Autonomous Governorate of Estonia|unified Estonia]] in April. The [[Governorate of Estonia]] in the north (corresponding to the historic [[Danish Estonia]]) was united with the northern part of the [[Governorate of Livonia]]. Elections for a provisional parliament, ''[[Maap\u00e4ev]]'', was organized, with the [[Menshevik]] and [[Bolshevik]] factions of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] obtaining a part of the vote. On 5 November 1917, two days before the [[October Revolution]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Estonian Bolshevik leader [[Jaan Anvelt]] violently usurped power from the legally constituted Maap\u00e4ev in a coup d'\u00e9tat, forcing the Maap\u00e4ev underground.\n\nIn February, after the collapse of the peace talks between Soviet Russia and the [[German Empire]], mainland Estonia was occupied by the Germans. Bolshevik forces retreated to Russia. Between the Russian [[Red Army]]'s retreat and the arrival of advancing German troops, the [[Salvation Committee]] of the Estonian National Council Maap\u00e4ev issued the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]]<ref name=\"EDoI1918\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.president.ee/en/estonia/ |title=Estonian Declaration of Independence |date=24 February 1918 |work=www.president.ee |publisher=Estonian National Council |accessdate=2009-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522173844/http://www.president.ee/en/estonia/ |archivedate=22 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> in [[P\u00e4rnu]] on 23 February 1918.\n\n===War of Independence===\n{{Main|German occupation of Estonia during World War I|Estonian War of Independence}}\n[[File:EstArmyHighCommnd1920.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The Estonian Army High Command in 1920]]\nAfter the collapse of the short-lived [[puppet government]] of the [[United Baltic Duchy]] and the withdrawal of German troops in November 1918, an [[Estonian Provisional Government]] retook office. A military invasion by the Red Army followed a few days later, however, marking the beginning of the [[Estonian War of Independence]] (1918\u20131920). The Estonian army cleared the entire territory of Estonia of the Red Army by February 1919. On 5\u20137 April 1919 the [[Estonian Constituent Assembly]] was elected.\n\n===Victory===\n[[File:TallinnWarMemorial2009.JPG|thumb|100px|right|[[War of Independence Victory Column|Victory Column]]]]\nOn 2 February 1920, the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] was signed by the Republic of Estonia and the [[Russian SFSR]]. The terms of the treaty stated that Russia renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia. The first [[Constitution of Estonia]] was adopted on 15 June 1920. The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.\n\nIn nearby [[History of Finland|Finland]] similar circumstances resulted in a bloody civil war. Despite repeated threats from fascist movements, Finland became and remained a free democracy under the rule of law. By contrast Estonia, without a civil war, started as a democracy and was turned into a dictatorship in 1934.<ref>Alan Siaroff, \"Democratic Breakdown and Democratic Stability: A Comparison of Interwar Estonia and Finland,\" ''[[Canadian Journal of Political Science]]'' Vol. 32, No. 1 (Mar. 1999), pp. 103\u2013124 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3232774 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Interwar period (1920\u20131939)==\n{{Main|History of Estonia (1920\u201339)}}\n[[File:Tallinn-Helsinki_1936_Aegna.jpg|thumb|right|Shipping poster from 1936]]\n[[File:VapsMovement.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Vaps Movement]] meeting in [[P\u00e4rnu]], [[Artur Sirk]] speaking]]\nThe first period of independence lasted 22 years, beginning in 1918. Estonia underwent a number of economic, social, and political reforms necessary to come to terms with its new status as a [[sovereign state]]. Economically and socially, [[land reform]] in 1919 was the most important step. Large estate holdings belonging to the [[Baltic nobility]] were redistributed among the peasants and especially among volunteers in the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. Estonia's principal markets became [[Scandinavia]], the United Kingdom, and western Europe, with some exports to the United States and to the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe first constitution of the Republic of Estonia, adopted in 1920, established a [[parliamentary]] form of government. The parliament (''[[Riigikogu]]'') consisted of 100 members elected for three-year terms. Between 1920 and 1934, Estonia had 21 governments.\n\nA mass anticommunist and antiparliamentary [[Vaps Movement]] emerged in the 1930s.<ref name=\"EBVaps\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/623213/Vaps| title=Vaps| year = 2009| work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]| publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> In October 1933 a [[referendum]] on constitutional reform initiated by the Vaps Movement was approved by 72.7 percent.<ref name=\"EBVaps\"/> The league spearheaded replacement of the parliamentary system with a [[presidential system|presidential form of government]] and laid the groundwork for an April 1934 presidential election, which it expected to win. However, the Vaps Movement was thwarted by a pre-emptive coup d'\u00e9tat on 12 March 1934, by [[Head of State of Estonia|Head of State]] [[Konstantin P\u00e4ts]], who then established his own authoritarian rule until a new constitution came to force. During the [[Era of Silence]], political parties were banned, and the parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938 as the country was [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]] by P\u00e4ts. The Vaps Movement was officially banned and finally disbanded in December 1935. On 6 May 1936, 150 members of the league went on trial and 143 of them were convicted to long-term prison sentences. They were granted an [[amnesty]] and freed in 1938, by which time the league had lost most of its popular support.\n\nThe interwar period was one of great cultural advancement.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Estonian language schools were established, and artistic life of all kinds flourished. One of the more notable cultural acts of the independence period, unique in western Europe at the time of its passage in 1925, was a guarantee of cultural autonomy to [[minority group]]s comprising at least 3,000 persons, including [[Jew]]s (see [[history of the Jews in Estonia]]). Historians see the lack of any bloodshed after a nearly \"700-year German rule\" as indication that it must have been mild by comparison.\n\nEstonia had pursued a policy of [[country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]], but it was of no consequence after the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] on 23 August 1939. In the agreement, the two great powers agreed to divide up the countries situated between them ([[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], Estonia, and [[Finland]]), with Estonia falling in the Soviet \"[[sphere of influence]]\". After the invasion of Poland, the [[Orze\u0142 incident]] took place when Polish submarine [[ORP Orze\u0142 (1938)|ORP ''Orze\u0142'']] looked for shelter in [[Tallinn]] but escaped after the Soviet Union attacked Poland on 17 September. Estonia's lack of will and/or inability to disarm and intern the crew caused the Soviet Union to accuse Estonia of \"helping them escape\" and claim that Estonia was not neutral. On 24 September 1939, the Soviet Union threatened Estonia with war unless provided with military bases in the country\u2014an ultimatum with which the Estonian government complied.\n\n==World War II (1939\u20131944)==\n{{Main|Occupation of the Baltic states}}\nFollowing the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], warships of the [[Red Navy]] appeared off Estonian ports on 24 September 1939, and Soviet bombers began a threatening patrol over [[Tallinn]] and the nearby countryside.<ref name=\"TM091939\">{{Cite journal|date=9 October 1939|title=RUSSIA: Moscow's Week|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762664,00.html|accessdate=2009-09-20|ref=harv}}</ref> Moscow demanded Estonia assent to an agreement which allowed the USSR to establish military bases and station 25,000 troops on Estonian soil for the duration of the European war.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Pabriks|Purs|Lane|2002|p=24}}</ref> The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement on 28 September 1939.\n\n===Soviet occupation (1940)===\n{{See also|Soviet deportations from Estonia|Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)}}\n\nThe Republic of Estonia was [[occupation of the Baltic states|occupied]] by the Soviet Union in June 1940.<ref>{{Cite book\n| title = The World Book Encyclopedia\n| year = 2003\n| publisher = [[World Book]]\n| location = Chicago, IL\n| isbn = 0-7166-0103-6\n| page =\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| last = O'Connor\n| first = Kevin J.\n| title = The History of the Baltic States\n| year = 2003\n| publisher = [[Greenwood Press]]\n| location = Westport, Conn.\n| isbn = 0-313-32355-0\n| pages =\n}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vm.ee/est/kat_533/7728.html |title=Molotovi\u2013Ribbentropi pakt ja selle tagaj\u00e4rjed |date=22 August 2006 |publisher=Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |language=Estonian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707164549/http://www.vm.ee/est/kat_533/7728.html |archivedate=7 July 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 12 June 1940, the order for a total military [[blockade]] of Estonia by the Soviet [[Baltic Fleet]] was given.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.mil.fi/laitokset/tiedotteet/1282.dsp| title=Kaleva-koneen tuhosta uutta tietoa| date=14 June 2005| work=www.mil.fi| publisher=Finnish Defence Forces| language=Finnish| accessdate=2009-09-20| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821221643/http://www.mil.fi/laitokset/tiedotteet/1282.dsp| archive-date=21 August 2009| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.rusin.fi/publications/warinpetsamo/indexEN.html |title=documents published |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205065414/http://www.rusin.fi/publications/warinpetsamo/indexEN.html |archivedate=5 February 2008|language=ru}} from the State Archive of the Russian Navy</ref>\n\nOn 14 June 1940, while the world's attention was focused on the fall of Paris to [[Nazi Germany]] a day earlier, the Soviet military blockade of Estonia went into effect, and two Soviet bombers downed Finnish passenger airplane [[Kaleva (airplane)|''Kaleva'']] flying from Tallinn to [[Helsinki]] carrying three diplomatic pouches from the U.S. legations in Tallinn, [[Riga]] and Helsinki.

But it soon{{When|date=February 2020}} became clear that sovereignty was out of the question. Estonia became a part of the German-occupied \"[[Reichskommissariat Ostland|Ostland]]\". A ''[[Sicherheitspolizei]]'' was established for internal security under the leadership of [[Ain-Ervin Mere]]. The initial enthusiasm that accompanied the liberation from Soviet occupation quickly waned as a result, and the Germans had limited success in recruiting volunteers. The [[conscription|draft]] was introduced in 1942, resulting in some 3,400 men fleeing to Finland to fight in the [[Finnish Army]] rather than join the Germans. [[Finnish Infantry Regiment 200]] (Estonian: ''soomepoisid'') was formed out of Estonian volunteers in Finland. With the Allied victory over Germany becoming certain in 1944, the only option to save Estonia's independence was to stave off a new Soviet invasion of Estonia until Germany's capitulation.\n\nBy January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Soviet Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border. [[Narva]] was evacuated. [[J\u00fcri Uluots]], the last legitimate prime minister of the Republic of Estonia (according to the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia) prior to its fall to the Soviet Union in 1940, delivered a radio address that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service. (Before this, Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization.)

The Estonian units saw action defending the [[Battle of Narva (1944)|Narva line]] throughout 1944.\n\nAs the Germans started to retreat on 18 September 1944, [[J\u00fcri Uluots]], the last Prime Minister of the Estonian Republic prior to Soviet occupation, assumed the responsibilities of president (as dictated in the Constitution) and appointed a new government while seeking recognition from the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. On 22 September 1944, as the last German units pulled out of Tallinn, the city was re-occupied by the Soviet Red Army. The new Estonian government fled to [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], and [[Estonian government-in-exile|operated in exile]] from 1944 until 1992, when [[Heinrich Mark]], the prime minister of the Estonian government in exile acting as president, presented his credentials to incoming president [[Lennart Meri]].\n\n====The Holocaust in Estonia====\n{{Main|The Holocaust in Estonia|History of the Jews in Estonia}}\nThe process of Jewish settlement in Estonia began in the 19th century, when in 1865 Russian Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] granted them the right to enter the region. The creation of the Republic of Estonia in 1918 marked the beginning of a new era for the Jews. Approximately 200 Jews fought in combat for the creation of the Republic of Estonia, and 70 of these men were volunteers. From the very first days of its existence as a state, Estonia showed tolerance towards all the peoples inhabiting its territories.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} On 12 February 1925, the Estonian government passed a law pertaining to the cultural autonomy of minority peoples. The Jewish community quickly prepared its application for cultural autonomy. Statistics on Jewish citizens were compiled. They totaled 3,045, fulfilling the minimum requirement of 3,000. In June 1926 the Jewish Cultural Council was elected and Jewish cultural autonomy was declared. Jewish cultural autonomy was of great interest to the global Jewish community. The Jewish National Endowment presented the [[Government of the Republic of Estonia]] with a certificate of gratitude for this achievement.<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Estonia.html?title=Jews_in_Estonia| title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Estonia| work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]| accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref>\n\nThere were, at the time of Soviet occupation in 1940, approximately 2,000 Estonian Jews. Many Jewish people were deported to Siberia along with other Estonians by the Soviets. It is estimated that 500 Jews suffered this fate. With the invasion of the Baltics, it was the intention of the Nazi government to use the Baltic countries as their main area of mass [[genocide]]. Consequently, Jews from countries outside the Baltics were shipped there to be exterminated.

More than 30,000 soldiers had been killed in action. In 1944 Russian [[airstrike|air raids]] had destroyed [[Narva]] and one-third of the residential area in [[Tallinn]]. By the late autumn of 1944, Soviet forces had ushered in a second phase of Soviet rule on the heels of the German troops withdrawing from Estonia, and followed it up by a new wave of arrests and executions of people considered disloyal to the Soviets.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n[[File:SovietPrisonDoorsTallinn.JPG|thumb|right|Soviet prison doors on display in the Museum of Occupation, Tallinn]]\nAn anti-Soviet [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement known as the [[Forest Brothers|''Metsavennad'' (\"Forest Brothers\")]] developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946\u201348. It is hard to tell how many people were in the ranks of the ''Metsavennad''; however, it is estimated that at different times there could have been about 30,000\u201335,000 people. Probably [[August Sabbe|the last Forest Brother]] was caught in September 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.\n\nIn March 1949, 20,722 people (2.5% of the population) were deported to Siberia. By the beginning of the 1950s, the occupying regime had suppressed the resistance movement.\n\nAfter the war the Communist Party of the [[Estonian SSR|Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (ECP) became the pre-eminent organization in the republic. The ethnic Estonian share in the total ECP membership decreased from 90% in 1941 to 48% in 1952.\n\n[[File:Flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Estonian SSR]]]]\n\n=== Khrushchev era ===\n{{See also|Khrushchev Thaw}}\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death, Communist Party membership vastly expanded its social base to include more ethnic Estonians. By the mid-1960s, the percentage of ethnic Estonian membership stabilized near 50%. On the eve of [[perestroika]] the ECP claimed about 100,000 members; less than half were ethnic Estonians and they totalled less than 7% of the country's population.\n\nOne positive aspect of the post-Stalin era in Estonia was the regranting of permission in the late 1950s for citizens to make contact with foreign countries. Ties were reactivated with [[Finland]], and in the 1960s, a ferry connection was opened from Tallinn to [[Helsinki]] and Estonians began watching Finnish television. This electronic \"window on the West\" afforded Estonians more information on current affairs and more access to Western culture and thought than any other group in the Soviet Union. This heightened media environment was important in preparing Estonians for their vanguard role in extending perestroika during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] era.\n\n==== Capital investments ====\nIn 1955 the TV Centre was built in Tallinn; it began TV broadcasts on 29 June of that year.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.rustrana.ru/print.php?nid=515| script-title=ru:\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f| date=11 October 2007| work=www.rustrana.ru| language=Russian| accessdate=2009-09-20| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110101628/http://www.rustrana.ru/print.php?nid=515| archive-date=10 January 2009| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Tallinn Song Festival Grounds]], the venue for the song festivals, were built in 1960.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.utlib.ee/fonoteek/IAML2003/laulu.htm| title=Tallinn Song Grounds| work=www.utlib.ee| accessdate=2009-09-20| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117214936/http://www.utlib.ee/fonoteek/IAML2003/laulu.htm| archive-date=17 January 2008| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Health care ====\nOnly after the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] period of 1956 did healthcare networks start to stabilise.

(In comparison, in Finland during the same period, consumption was only 6\u20137 litres per person per annum.)\n\n=== Gorbachev era ===\n{{See also|Perestroika|Glasnost}}\nBy the beginning of the Gorbachev era, concern over the cultural survival of the Estonian people had reached a critical point. The ECP remained stable in the early perestroika years but waned in the late 1980s. Other political movements, groupings and parties moved to fill the power vacuum. The first and most important was the [[Estonian Popular Front]], established in April 1988 with its own platform, leadership and broad constituency. The [[Estonian Greens|Greens]] and the dissident-led [[Estonian National Independence Party]] soon followed.\n\n== Restoration of ''de facto'' independence ==\nThe [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration]] was issued on 16 November 1988.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Dissent and Opposition in Communist Eastern Europe |last=Pollack |first=Detlef |authorlink= |author2=Jan Wielgohs |year=2004 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |location= |isbn=978-0-7546-3790-5 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZoYgF9oCvOcC&pg=PA134&dq }}</ref> By 1989 the political spectrum had widened, and new parties were formed and re-formed almost daily. The republic's [[Supreme Soviet]] transformed into an authentic regional lawmaking body. This relatively conservative legislature passed an early declaration of sovereignty (16 November 1988); a law on economic independence (May 1989) confirmed by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] that November; a language law making Estonian the [[official language]] (January 1989); and local and republic election laws stipulating residency requirements for voting and candidacy (August, November 1989).\n\nDespite the emergence of the Popular Front and the Supreme Soviet as a new lawmaking body, since 1989 the different segments of the indigenous Estonian population had been politically mobilized by different and competing actors. The Popular Front's proposal to declare the independence of Estonia as a new, so-called \"third republic\" whose citizens would be all those living there at the moment, found less and less support over time.\n\nA grassroots [[Estonian Citizens' Committees]] Movement launched in 1989 with the objective of registering all pre-war citizens of the Republic of Estonia and their descendants in order to convene a [[Congress of Estonia]]. Their emphasis was on the illegal nature of the Soviet system and that hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of Estonia had not ceased to be citizens of the Estonian Republic which still existed ''de jure'', recognized by the majority of Western nations. Despite the hostility of the mainstream official press and intimidation by Soviet Estonian authorities, dozens of local citizens' committees were elected by popular initiative all over the country. These quickly organized into a nationwide structure, and by the beginning of 1990 over 900,000 people had registered themselves as citizens of the Republic of Estonia.\n\nThe spring of 1990 saw two free elections and two alternative legislatures developed in Estonia. On 24 February 1990, the 464-member Congress of Estonia (including 35 delegates of refugee communities abroad) was elected by the registered citizens of the republic. The Congress of Estonia convened for the first time in Tallinn 11\u201312 March 1990, passing 14 declarations and resolutions. A 70-member standing committee ([[Eesti Komitee]]) was elected with [[Tunne Kelam]] as its chairman.\n\nIn March 1991 a referendum was held on the issue of independence. This was somewhat controversial, as holding a referendum could be taken as signalling that Estonian independence would be established rather than \"re\"-established. There was some discussion about whether it was appropriate to allow the Russian immigrant minority to vote, or if this decision should be reserved exclusively for citizens of Estonia. In the end all major political parties backed the referendum, considering it most important to send a strong signal to the world. To further legitimise the vote, all residents of Estonia were allowed to participate. The result vindicated these decisions, as the referendum produced a strong endorsement for independence. Turnout was 82%, and 64% of all possible voters in the country backed independence, with only 17% against.\n\nAlthough the majority of Estonia's large Russian-speaking diaspora of Soviet-era immigrants did not support full independence, they were divided in their goals for the republic. In March 1990 some 18% of Russian speakers supported the idea of a fully independent Estonia, up from 7% the previous autumn, and by early 1990 only a small minority of ethnic Estonians were opposed to full independence.\n\nIn the 18 March 1990, elections for the 105-member Supreme Soviet, all residents of Estonia were eligible to participate, including all Soviet-era immigrants from the U.S.S.R. and approximately 50,000 Soviet troops stationed there. The Popular Front coalition, composed of [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[centrism|centrist parties]] and led by former [[Central Planning Committee]] official [[Edgar Savisaar]], gained a parliamentary majority.\n\n[[File:Toompea castle house of parliament.JPG|thumb|Toompea castle \u2013 the seat of the [[Riigikogu]]]]\n\nOn 8 May 1990, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia (renamed the previous day) changed the name to the Republic of Estonia. Through a strict, non-confrontational policy in pursuing independence, Estonia managed to avoid the violence which [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] incurred in the bloody January 1991 crackdowns and in the border customs-post guard murders that summer. During the attempted [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August coup]] in the U.S.S.R., Estonia was able to maintain constant operation and control of its telecommunications facilities, thereby offering the West a clear view into the latest developments and serving as a conduit for swift Western support and recognition of Estonia's \"confirmation\" of independence on 20 August 1991. 20 August remains a national holiday in Estonia because of this. Following Europe's lead, the United States formally reestablished diplomatic relations with Estonia on 2 September, and the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] offered recognition on 6 September.\n\nSince the debates about whether the future independent Estonia would be established as a new republic or a continuation of the first republic were not yet complete by the time of the August coup, while the members of the Supreme Soviet generally agreed that independence should be declared rapidly, a compromise was hatched between the two main sides: instead of \"declaring\" independence, which would imply a new start, or explicitly asserting continuity, the declaration would \"confirm\" Estonia as a state independent of the Soviet Union, and willing to reestablish diplomatic relations of its own accord. The text of the statement was in Estonian and only a few paragraphs in length.<ref name=\"decl\">A.

Since fully regaining independence Estonia has had fifteen governments with ten prime ministers: [[Mart Laar]], [[Andres Tarand]], [[Tiit V\u00e4hi]], [[Mart Siimann]], [[Siim Kallas]], [[Juhan Parts]], [[Andrus Ansip]], [[Taavi R\u00f5ivas]] and [[J\u00fcri Ratas]]. The PMs of the interim government (1990\u20131992) were [[Edgar Savisaar]] and Tiit V\u00e4hi.\n\nSince the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. Estonia opened accession negotiations with the [[European Union]] in 1998 and joined in 2004, shortly after becoming a member of [[NATO]].\n\n== Contemporary Estonian government (1992\u2013present)==\n[[File:Registration card for Estonian citizenship from 1989.JPG|thumb|Registration card for Estonian citizenship from 1989]]\n{{see also|Politics of Estonia|Elections in Estonia}}\nOn 28 June 1992, Estonian voters approved the constitutional assembly's draft constitution and implementation act, which established a parliamentary government with a president as chief of state and with a government headed by a prime minister. The [[Riigikogu]], a unicameral legislative body, is the highest organ of state authority. It initiates and approves legislation sponsored by the prime minister. The prime minister has full responsibility and control over his cabinet.\n\n=== Meri presidency and Laar premiership (1992\u20132001) ===\nParliamentary and presidential elections were held on 20 September 1992. Approximately 68% of the country's 637,000 registered voters cast ballots. [[Lennart Meri]], an outstanding writer and former [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Estonia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], won this election and became [[President of Estonia|president]]. He chose 32-year-old historian and [[Party of Estonian Christian Democrats|Christian Democratic Party]] founder [[Mart Laar]] as prime minister.\n\nIn February 1992, and with amendments in January 1995, the Riigikogu renewed Estonia's 1938 citizenship law, which also provides equal civil protection to resident aliens. Elected on an ambitious programme of reform, Mart Laar's cabinet took several decisive measures ([[Shock therapy (economics)|Shock therapy]]). Fast privatization was pursued and the role of the state in the economy as well as in the social affairs was reduced dramatically. After an initial steep decline in GDP, the Estonian economy started to grow again in 1995. Changes came with a social price: the [[average life expectancy]] in Estonia in 1994 was lower than in Belarus, Ukraine and even Moldova.<ref>[https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&hl=en&dl=en#!ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=region&idim=country:EST:BLR:MDA:RUS:UKR:LVA:LTU&ifdim=region&tstart=-314157600000&tend=1358460000000&hl=en_US&dl=en&ind=false World Development Indicators]</ref> Among the vulnerable sectors of society, the radical reforms sparked an outrage. In January 1993, a pensioners' [[demonstration (protest)|demonstration]] took place in Tallinn, as pensioners felt it was impossible to live with a pension as low as the one in effect at the time (260 EEK (around 20 EUR) a month<ref>http://www.baltic-course.com/rus/_analytics/?doc=57563</ref>). The meeting was aggressive and demonstrators attacked the minister of social affairs [[Marju Lauristin]].<ref>[http://m.epl.delfi.ee/article.php?id=50806224 K\u00fcmme aastat uut Eestit, 1993] Eesti P\u00e4evaleht, 14. juuli 2001.</ref>\n\nThe opposition won the 1995 election, but to a large extent continued with the previous governments' policies.\n\nIn 1996, Estonia ratified a border agreement with Latvia and completed work with Russia on a technical border agreement. President Meri was re-elected in free and fair indirect elections in August and September in 1996. During parliamentary elections in 1999, the seats in the Riigikogu were divided as follows: the [[Estonian Centre Party]] received 28, the [[Pro Patria Union]] 18, the [[Estonian Reform Party]] 18, the People's Party Moderates (election cartel between Moderates and People's Party) 17, Coalition Party 7, Country People's Party (now [[People's Union of Estonia]]) 7, and the United People's Party's electoral cartel 6 seats. Pro Patria Union, the Reform Party, and the Moderates formed a government with Mart Laar as prime minister, whereas the Centre Party with the Coalition Party, People's Union, United People's Party, and members of parliament who were not members of factions formed the opposition in the Riigikogu.\n\nThe [[1999 Estonian parliamentary election|1999 Parliamentary election]], with a 5% threshold and no electoral cartel allowed, resulted in a disaster for the Coalition Party, which achieved only seven seats together with two of its smaller allies. Estonian Ruralfolk Party, which participated the election on its own list, obtained seven seats as well.\n\nThe programme of Mart Laar's government was signed by Pro Patria Union, the Reform Party, the Moderates, and the People's Party. The latter two merged soon after, so Mart Laar's second government is widely known as ''Kolmikliit'', or the Tripartite coalition. Notwithstanding the different political orientation of the ruling parties, the coalition stayed united until Laar resigned in December 2001, after the Reform Party had broken up the same coalition in Tallinn municipality, making opposition leader [[Edgar Savisaar]] the new mayor of Tallinn. After the resignation of Laar, the Reform Party and Estonian Centre Party formed a coalition that lasted until the next parliamentary election, in 2003.\n\nThe Moderates joined with the People's Party on 27 November 1999, forming the People's Party Moderates.\n\n=== R\u00fc\u00fctel presidency and Siim Kallas government (2001\u20132002) ===\nIn fall 2001 [[Arnold R\u00fc\u00fctel]] became the President of the Republic of Estonia, and in January 2002 Prime Minister Laar stepped down.

Accession to the EU took place on 1 May of the following year.\n\nIn February 2004 the People's Party Moderates renamed themselves the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party of Estonia]].\n\nOn 8 May 2004, a defection of several Centre Party members to form a new party, the Social Liberal Party, over a row concerning the Centrists' \"no\" stance to joining the European Union changed the allocation of the seats in the Riigikogu. Social-liberals had eight seats, but a hope to form a new party disappeared by 10 May 2005, because most members in the social-liberal group joined other parties.\n\n===Andrus Ansip government (2004)===\nOn 24 March Prime Minister [[Juhan Parts]] announced his resignation following a vote of [[no confidence]] in the Riigikogu against [[Ministry of Justice (Estonia)|Minister of Justice]] [[Ken-Marti Vaher]], which was held on 21 March.

Ansip formed a government out of a coalition of his Reform Party with the People's Union and the Centre Party. Approval by the Riigikogu, which by law must decide within 14 days of his nomination, came on 12 April 2005. Ansip was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the Estonian parliament. Forty deputies voted against his candidature. The general consensus in the Estonian media seems to be that the new [[Andrus Ansip's cabinet|cabinet]], on the level of competence, is not necessarily an improvement over the old one.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nOn 18 May 2005, Estonia signed a border treaty with the [[Russian Federation]] in Moscow. The treaty was ratified by the Riigikogu on 20 June 2005. However, in the end of June the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed that it did not intend to become a party to the border treaty and did not consider itself bound by the circumstances concerning the object and the purposes of the treaty because the Riigikogu had attached a preambule to the ratification act that referenced earlier documents that mentioned the Soviet occupation and the uninterrupted legal continuity of the Republic of Estonia during the Soviet period. The issue remains unsolved and is the focus of European-level discussions.\n\nOn 4 April 2006, Fatherland Union and Res Publica decided to form a united right-conservative party. The two parties joining was approved on 4 June by both parties in P\u00e4rnu. The joined party name is Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit ([[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]]).\n\n=== 2007 elections ===\nThe [[2007 Estonian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary elections]] have shown an improvement in the scores of the Reform Party, gaining 12 seats and reaching 31 MPs; the Centre Party held, while the unified right-conservative [[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]] lost 16. Socialdemocrats gained 4 seats, while the Greens entered the Parliaments with 7 seats, at the expense of the agrarian [[People's Union of Estonia|People's Union]] which lost 6. The new configuration of the Estonian Parliament shows a prevalence of centre-left parties. The Centre Party, led by the mayor of Tallinn [[Edgar Savisaar]], has been increasingly excluded from collaboration, since his open collaboration with [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]]'s [[United Russia]] party, real estate scandals in Tallinn,<ref name=\"savisaarrealestate\">[http://www.delfi.ee/archive/article.php?id=11378593 Savisaar's and Kruuda's mutual gifts]</ref> and the [[Bronze Soldier]] controversy, considered as a deliberate attempt of splitting the Estonian society by provoking the Russian minority.<ref name=\"splitter\">[http://postimees.ee/300407/esileht/arvamus/257922.php L\u00f5hestaja number \u00fcks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006120354/http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/arvamus/257922.php |date=6 October 2007 }} Postimees</ref> The lack of a concrete possibility for government alternance in Estonia has been quoted as a concern.<ref name=presseurop/>\n\n=== Estonia and the European Union ===\nOn 14 September 2003, following negotiations that began in 1998, the citizens of Estonia were asked in a referendum whether or not they wished to join the [[European Union]].

Accession to the EU took place on 1 May of the following year.\n\nIn its [[2004 European Parliament election in Estonia|first European Parliament elections in 2004]], [[Estonia (European Parliament constituency)|Estonia]] elected three [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] for the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party]] (PES), while the governing [[Res Publica Party]] and [[People's Union of Estonia|People's Union]] polled poorly, not being able to gain any of the other three MEP posts. The [[voter turnout]] in Estonia was one of the lowest of all member countries, at only 26.8%. A similar trend was visible in most of the new member states that joined the EU in 2004.\n\nThe [[2009 European Parliament election|European Parliament election of 2009 in Estonia]] scored a 43.9% turnout \u2013 about 17.1% higher than during the [[2004 European Parliament election in Estonia|previous election]], and slightly above the European average of 42.94%. Six seats were up for taking in this election: two of them were won by the [[Estonian Centre Party]]. [[Estonian Reform Party]], [[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]], [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party]] and an independent candidate [[Indrek Tarand]] (who gathered the support of 102,460 voters, only 1,046 votes less than the winner of the election) all won one seat each. The success of independent candidates has been attributed both to general disillusionment with major parties and the use of closed lists which rendered voters incapable of casting a vote for specific candidates in party lists.\n\nOn 1 January 2011 Estonia adopted the [[euro]]. The enlargement of the [[eurozone]] was hailed as a good sign in a period of global financial crisis. However, the government cut down public service salaries; the only opposition, in the absence of organised unions, came from Estonian teachers, whose salary cuts were therefore limited.<ref name=presseurop>[http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/478531-most-soviet-western-state PressEurope], 26 January 2011</ref>\n\n[[Estonian euro coins]] entered circulation on 1 January 2011. Estonia was the fifth of ten states that joined the EU in 2004, and the first ex-Soviet republic to join the [[eurozone]]. Of the ten new member states, Estonia was the first to unveil its design.

From 1418 to 1562 the whole of Estonia formed part of the [[Livonian Confederation]]. After the [[Livonian War]] of 1558-1583, Estonia became part of the [[Swedish Empire]] until 1710/1721, [[Capitulation of Estonia and Livonia|when Sweden ceded it]] to [[Russian Empire|Russia]] as a result of the [[Great Northern War]] of 1700-1721.

In the aftermath of World War I (1914-1918) and the Russian revolutions of 1917, Estonians  [[Estonian Declaration of Independence|declared their independence]] in February 1918. The [[Estonian War of Independence]] (1918-1920) ensued on two fronts: the newly proclaimed state fought against [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Bolshevist Russia]] to the east and against the Baltic German forces (the [[Baltische Landeswehr]]) to the south. The [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Tartu Peace Treaty]] (February 1920) marked the end of fighting and recognised Estonian independence in perpetuity.\n\nIn 1940, in the wake of the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939, the [[Soviet Union]] occupied Estonia and (according to e.g. the US,<ref name=\"USA\">{{Cite web|url = https://2001-2009.state.gov/p/eur/rls/rm/86539.htm |title= U.S.-Baltic Relations: Celebrating 85 Years of Friendship |last= Fried|first= Daniel|date= 14 June 2007|publisher= U.S. State Department}}</ref> the EU,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML+MOTION+B6-2007-0215+0+DOC+PDF+V0//EN|title= Motion for a resolution on the Situation in Estonia|date= 21 May 2007|publisher= European Parliament|accessdate= 2009-09-19}}</ref> and the [[European Court of Human Rights]]{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}) illegally annexed the country.

The Kunda culture received its name from the [[Kunda, Estonia|''Lammasm\u00e4e'']] settlement site in northern Estonia, which dates from earlier than 8500 BC.<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|p=24}}</ref> Bone and stone artifacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in [[Latvia]], northern [[Lithuania]] and southern [[Finland]]. Among minerals, [[flint]] and [[quartz]] were used the most for making cutting tools.\n\n===Neolithic Period===\nThe beginning of the [[Neolithic Period]] is marked by the [[ceramics]] of the Narva culture, and appear in Estonia at the beginning of the 5th millennium. The oldest finds date from around 4900 BC. The first pottery was made of thick clay mixed with pebbles, shells or plants. The Narva-type ceramics are found throughout almost the entire Estonian coastal region and on the islands. The stone and bone tools of the era have a notable similarity with the artifacts of the Kunda culture.\n[[File:CombCeramicPottery.jpg|thumb|left|[[Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture|Comb Ceramic]] pottery at the Estonian History Museum]]\nAround the beginning of 4th millennium BC [[Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture|Comb Ceramic culture]] arrived in Estonia.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{harvnb|M\u00e4esalu|Lukas|Laur|Tannberg|2004|p=}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref> Until the early 1980s the arrival of [[Balto-Finnic peoples]], the ancestors of the Estonians, Finns, and Livonians, on the shores of the [[Baltic Sea]] was associated with the Comb Ceramic Culture.<ref>{{Cite book\n| last1 = Minahan\n| first1 = James\n| title = Miniature Empires: A historical dictionary of the newly independent states\n| year = 1998\n| publisher = [[Greenwood Press]]\n| location = Westport, Connecticut\n| isbn = 0-313-30610-9\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=RSxt-JB-PDkC&pg=PA153\n| page = 153\n}}</ref> However, such a linking of archaeologically defined cultural entities with linguistic ones cannot be proven, and it has been suggested that the increase of settlement finds in the period is more likely to have been associated with an economic boom related to the warming of climate.

The development of the borders between the [[Balto-Finnic peoples|Finnic peoples]] and the [[Balts]] was under way. The first fortified settlements, Asva and Ridala on the island of [[Saaremaa]] and Iru in Northern Estonia, began to be built. The development of shipbuilding facilitated the spread of bronze. Changes took place in burial customs, a new type of burial ground spread from Germanic to Estonian areas, and stone [[cist]] graves and cremation burials became increasingly common, alongside a small number of boat-shaped stone graves.<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|p=26}}</ref>\n\nAbout the 7th century BC, a large meteorite hit [[Saaremaa]] island and created the [[Kaali crater]]s.\n\nAbout 325 BC, the Greek explorer [[Pytheas]] possibly visited Estonia.

The oldest iron items were imported, although since the 1st century iron was [[smelting|smelted]] from local marsh and lake ore. Settlement sites were located mostly in places that offered natural protection. Fortresses were built, although used temporarily. The appearance of square [[Celtic field]]s surrounded by enclosures in Estonia date from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The majority of stones with man-made indents, which presumably were connected with magic designed to increase crop fertility, date from this period. A new type of grave, quadrangular burial mounds, began to develop. Burial traditions show the clear beginning of [[social stratification]].\n\nThis period saw a single Siberian Y-DNA haplogroup making up half of male lineages in Estonia.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20190512050452/https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(19)30424-5</ref>\n\nThe [[Roman Iron Age]] in Estonia is roughly dated to between 50 and 450 AD, the era that was affected by the influence of the [[Roman Empire]]. In material culture this is reflected by a few Roman coins, some jewellery and artefacts. The abundance of iron artefacts in Southern Estonia speaks of closer mainland ties with southern areas, while the islands of western and northern Estonia communicated with their neighbors mainly by sea. By the end of the period three clearly defined tribal dialectical areas\u2014Northern Estonia, Southern Estonia, and Western Estonia including the islands\u2014had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|pp=28\u201331}}</ref>\n\n===Early Middle Ages===\n[[File:Europe 814.svg|thumb|Europe in the 9th century]]\n\nThe name \"Estonia\" occurs first in a form of [[Aestii]] in the 1st century AD by [[Tacitus]]; however, it might have indicated Baltic tribes living in the area.

The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major counties had developed in Estonia: [[Saare County|Saaremaa]] (Osilia), [[L\u00e4\u00e4nemaa]] (Rotalia or Maritima), [[Harjumaa (ancient county)|Harjumaa]] (Harria), [[R\u00e4vala]] (Revalia), [[Virumaa]] (Vironia), [[J\u00e4rvamaa]] (Jervia), [[Sakala County|Sakala]] (Saccala), and [[Ugandi County|Ugandi]] (Ugaunia).<ref name=\"estonia_and_the_estonians\">{{Cite book\n| last1 = Raun\n| first1 = Toivo U.\n| title = Estonia and the Estonians\n| year = 2001\n| publisher = [[Hoover Institution Press]], Stanford University\n| location = Stanford, California\n| isbn = 0-8179-2852-9\n| url = https://books.google.com/?id=YQ1NRJlUrwkC&pg=PA11\n| page = 11\n}}</ref>\n\n[[Varbola Stronghold]] was one of the largest circular rampart fortresses and trading centers built in Estonia, [[Harju County]] ({{lang-la|Harria}}) at the time.\n\nIn the 11th century the Scandinavians are frequently chronicled as combating the [[Vikings]] from the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea.\nWith the rise of Christianity, centralized authority in Scandinavia and Germany eventually led to the [[Baltic crusades]].\nThe east Baltic world was transformed by military conquest: first the [[Livs]], [[Latvians|Letts]] and [[Estonians]], then the [[Old Prussians|Prussians]] and the [[Finns]] underwent defeat, [[baptism]], [[military occupation]] and sometimes extermination by groups of Germans, Danes and Swedes.<ref name=\"the_northern_crusades\">{{Cite book\n| last1 = Christiansen\n| first1 = Eric\n| title = The Northern Crusades\n| edition = 2nd\n| year = 1997\n| publisher = [[Penguin Group|Penguin]]\n| location = London, England\n| isbn = 0-14-026653-4\n| page = [https://archive.org/details/northerncrusades00eric/page/93 93]\n| url = https://archive.org/details/northerncrusades00eric/page/93\n}}</ref>\n\n==Estonian Crusade: The Middle Ages==<!-- This section is linked from [[Estonian language]] -->\n[[File:Ancient Estonian counties.png|thumb|200px|left|[[Ancient Estonia]] until 21 September 1217]]\n[[File:Danmarks flag 1219 Lorentzen.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Flag of Denmark|Dannebrog]] falling from the sky during the [[Battle of Lyndanisse|Battle of Lindanise]], 1219]]\n{{Main|Livonian Crusade}}\n\nEstonia was one of the last corners of medieval Europe to be [[Christianity|Christianized]]. In 1193 [[Pope Celestine III]] called for a crusade against [[paganism|pagan]]s in Northern Europe. The [[Northern Crusades]] from Northern Germany established the stronghold of [[Riga]] (in modern Latvia). With the help of the newly converted local tribes of [[Livonians|Livs]] and [[Latvians|Letts]], the crusaders initiated raids into part of what is present-day Estonia in 1208. Estonian tribes fiercely resisted the attacks from Riga and occasionally themselves sacked territories controlled by the crusaders. In 1217 the German crusading order the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Sword Brethren]] and their recently converted allies won a major battle in which the Estonian commander [[Lembitu]] was killed. The period of the several Northern Crusade battles in Estonia between 1208 and 1227 is also known as the period of the ancient Estonian fight for independence.\n\n==Danish Estonia==\n{{Main|Danish Estonia}}\n[[File:Medieval Livonia 1260.svg|left|150px|thumb|[[Livonia]] in 1260]]\nNorthern Estonia was conquered by Danish crusaders led by king [[Valdemar II of Denmark|Waldemar II]], who arrived in 1219 on the site of the Estonian town of Lindanisse<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://runeberg.org/salmonsen/2/7/0518.html|title=Salmonsens konversationsleksikon / 2/7|publisher=[[Project Runeberg]]|language=Danish|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> (now [[Tallinn]]) at (Latin) ''Revelia'' (Estonian) ''Revala'' or ''[[R\u00e4vala]]'', the adjacent ancient Estonian county.

The province was occupied by the [[Livonian Order]] as a result. In 1346, the Danish dominions in Estonia ([[Harria]] and [[Vironia]]) were sold for 10&nbsp;000 [[mark (unit)|marks]] to the [[Livonian Order]].\n\n===Swedish coastal settlements===\nThe first written mention of the [[Estonian Swedes]] comes from 1294, in the laws of the town of [[Haapsalu]]. Estonian Swedes are one of the earliest known minorities in Estonia. They have also been called \"Coastal Swedes\" (''Rannarootslased'' in [[Estonian language|Estonian]]), or according to their settlement area [[Ruhnu]] Swedes, Hiiu Swedes etc. They themselves used the expression ''aibofolke'' (\"island people\"), and called their homeland ''[[Aiboland]]''.\n\nThe ancient areas of Swedish settlement in Estonia were Ruhnu Island, [[Hiiumaa]] Island, the west coast and smaller islands ([[Vormsi]], [[Noarootsi]], Sutlepa, Riguldi, [[Osmussaar]]), the northwest coast of the Harju District ([[N\u00f5va Parish|N\u00f5va]], [[Vihterpalu]], [[Kurkse]], the [[Pakri Peninsula]] and the [[Pakri Islands]]), and [[Naissaar]] Island near Tallinn. The towns with a significant percentage of Swedish population have been [[Haapsalu]] and Tallinn.\n\nIn earlier times Swedes also lived on the coasts of Saaremaa, the southern part of [[L\u00e4\u00e4nemaa]], the eastern part of [[Harjumaa]] and the western part of [[Virumaa]].\n\n==Terra Mariana==\n{{Main|Terra Mariana}}\n[[File:Narva Hermanni kindlus, 21. juuli 2011.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Hermann castle, Narva|[[Hermann Castle]], Narva, was one of the Teutonic Order's castles in Estonia.]]\nIn 1227 the Sword Brethren conquered the last indigenous stronghold on the Estonian island of [[Saaremaa]].

The northern part of Estonia \u2013 more exactly Harjumaa and Virumaa districts (in German: Harrien und Wierland) \u2013 was a nominal possession of [[Denmark]] until 1346. [[Tallinn]] (Reval) was given the [[L\u00fcbeck law|L\u00fcbeck Rights]] in 1248 and joined the [[Hanseatic League]] at the end of the 13th century. In 1343 the people of northern Estonia and Saaremaa (Oesel) Island started a rebellion ([[St. George's Night Uprising]]) against the rule of their German-speaking landlords. The uprising was put down, and four elected Estonian \"kings\" were killed in [[Paide]] during peace negotiations in 1343.

The Reformation in Estonia was inspired and organized by local and Swedish secular and religious authorities \u2013 especially after the end of the Livonian War in 1582. [[Lutheranism]] spread literacy among the young, and it transformed religious art. However, the peasants were traditionalists and were more comfortable with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] traditions; they delayed the adoption of the new religion. After 1600, Swedish Lutheranism began to dominate the building, furnishing, and (modest) decoration of new churches. Church architecture was now designed to encourage congregational understanding of and involvement in the services. Pews and seats were installed for the common people to make listening to the sermon less of a burden, and altars often featured depictions of the [[Last Supper]], but images and statues of the [[list of saints|saints]] had disappeared.<ref>Krista Kodres, \"Church and art in the First Century of the reformation in Estonia: Towards Lutheran orthodoxy,\" ''Scandinavian Journal of History'' (2003) 28#3 pp 187\u2013203. online</ref> The [[Baltic Germans|Baltic German elite]] promoted Lutheranism, and language, education, religion and politics were greatly transformed.

In 1625, mainland Estonia came entirely under Swedish rule. Estonia was administratively divided between the provinces of [[Duchy of Estonia (1561\u20131721)|Estonia]] in the north and [[Livonia]] in southern Estonia and northern Latvia, a division which persisted until the early 20th century.\n\n[[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor]] asked for help of [[Gustav I of Sweden]], and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] also began direct negotiations with Gustavus, but nothing resulted because on 29 September 1560, Gustavus I Vasa died. The chances for success of [[Magnus von Lyffland]] and his supporters looked particularly good in 1560 and 1570. In the former case he had been recognised as their [[Monarch|sovereign]] by the [[Bishopric of \u00d6sel\u2013Wiek]] and the [[Bishopric of Courland]], and as their prospective ruler by the authorities of the [[Bishopric of Dorpat]]; the [[Bishopric of Reval]] with the [[Harrien]]-[[Wierland]] [[gentry]] were on his side; and the [[Livonian Order]] conditionally recognised his right of ownership of the principality of Estonia. Then, along with [[Archbishop]] [[Wilhelm von Brandenburg]] of the [[Archbishopric of Riga]] and his [[Coadjutor archbishop|coadjutor]] [[Christopher, Duke of Mecklenburg|Christoph von Mecklenburg]], Kettler gave to Magnus the portions of the [[Kingdom of Livonia]] which he had taken possession of, but they refused to give him any more land. Once [[Eric XIV of Sweden]] became king, he took quick actions to get involved in the war. He negotiated a continued peace with [[Muscovy]] and spoke to the [[bourgeoisie|burgher]]s of [[Reval]] city. He offered them goods to submit to him, as well as threatening them. By 6 June 1561, they submitted to him, contrary to the persuasions of Kettler to the burghers. The King's brother Johan married the Polish princess [[Catherine Jagiellon]]. Wanting to obtain his own land in Livonia, he loaned Poland money and then claimed the castles they had pawned as his own instead of using them to pressure Poland. After Johan returned to [[Finland]], Erik XIV forbade him to deal with any foreign countries without his consent. Shortly after that Erik XIV started acting quickly and lost any allies he was about to obtain, either from Magnus or the Archbishop of [[Riga]]. Magnus was upset he had been tricked out of his [[inheritance]] of [[Holstein]]. After Sweden [[military occupation|occupied]] Reval, [[Frederick II of Denmark]] made a treaty with Erik XIV of Sweden in August 1561. The brothers were in great disagreement, and Frederick II negotiated a treaty with Ivan IV on 7 August 1562, in order to help his brother obtain more land and stall further Swedish advance. Erik XIV did not like this and the [[Northern Seven Years' War]] between the [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck]], Denmark, Poland, and Sweden broke out. While only losing land and trade, Frederick II and Magnus were not faring well. But in 1568, Erik XIV became [[insane]], and his brother Johan III took his place. Johan III ascended to the throne of Sweden, and due to his friendship with Poland he began a policy against Muscovy. He would try to obtain more land in Livonia and exercise strength over Denmark. After all parties had been financially drained, Frederick II let his ally, King [[Sigismund II Augustus]] of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]], know that he was ready for peace. On 13 December 1570, the [[Treaty of Stettin (1570)|Treaty of Stettin]] was concluded. It is, however, more difficult to estimate the scope and magnitude of the support Magnus received in Livonian cities. Compared to the Harrien-Wierland gentry, the Reval city council, and hence probably the majority of citizens, demonstrated a much more reserved attitude towards Denmark and King Magnus of Livonia. Nevertheless, there is no reason to speak about any strong pro-Swedish sentiments among the residents of Reval. The citizens who had fled to the Bishopric of Dorpat or had been deported to Muscovy hailed Magnus as their saviour until 1571. The analysis indicates that during the [[Livonian War]] a pro-independence wing emerged among the Livonian gentry and townspeople, forming the so-called \"Peace Party\". Dismissing hostilities, these forces perceived an agreement with Muscovy as a chance to escape the atrocities of war and avoid the division of Livonia. That is why Magnus, who represented Denmark and later struck a deal with [[Ivan the Terrible]], proved a suitable figurehead for this faction.\n\n[[File:Livland 15jh.png|right|350px|thumb|Livonia, as shown in the map of 1573 of Joann Portantius]]\n\nThe Peace Party, however, had its own armed forces \u2013 scattered bands of household troops (''Hofleute'') under diverse command, which only united in action in 1565 ([[Battle of P\u00e4rnu]] and [[Siege of Reval, 1565]]), in 1570\u20131571 ([[Siege of Reval, 1570\u20131571]]; 30 weeks), and in 1574\u20131576 (first on Sweden's side, then came the sale of [[L\u00e4\u00e4ne County|Wiek]] to the [[monarchy of Denmark|Danish Crown]] and the loss of the territory to the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Muscovites]]). In 1575 after Muscovy attacked Danish claims in Livonia, Frederick II dropped out of the competition, as did the Holy Roman Emperor. After this Johan III held off on his pursuit for more land due to Muscovy obtaining lands that Sweden controlled. He used the next two years of truce to get in a better position. In 1578, he resumed the fight for not only Livonia, but also everywhere due to an understanding he made with [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Rzeczpospolita]]. In 1578 Magnus retired to Rzeczpospolita, and his brother all but gave up the land in Livonia.\n\nHaving rejected peace proposals from its enemies, [[Ivan the Terrible]] found himself in a difficult position by 1579, when the [[Crimean Khanate]] devastated Muscovian territories and burnt down Moscow (see [[Russo-Crimean Wars]]), the drought and epidemics had fatally affected the economy, the policy of [[oprichnina]] had thoroughly disrupted the government, while the [[Grand Principality of Lithuania]] [[Union of Lublin|had united with]] the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385\u20131569)|Kingdom of Poland]] and acquired an energetic leader, [[Stefan Batory]], supported by the [[Ottoman Empire]] (1576). Batory replied with a series of three [[offensive (military)|offensive]]s against Muscovy, trying to cut the [[Kingdom of Livonia]] from Muscovian territories. During his first offensive in 1579 with 22,000 men he retook [[Polotsk]]. During the second, in 1580, with a 29,000-strong army he took [[Wielkie \u0141uki|Velikie Luki]], and in 1581 with a 100,000-strong army he started the [[Siege of Pskov]]. Frederick II had trouble continuing the fight against Muscovy unlike [[Sweden]] and Poland. He came to an agreement with [[John III of Sweden]] in 1580 giving him the titles in Livonia. That war would last from 1577 to 1582. Muscovy recognized Polish\u2013Lithuanian control of [[Ducatus Ultradunensis]] only in 1582. After [[Magnus von Lyffland]] died in 1583, Poland invaded his territories in the [[Duchy of Courland]] and Frederick II decided to sell his rights of inheritance. Except for the island of [[\u0152sel]], [[Denmark]] was out of the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] by 1585. In 1598 [[Duchy of Livonia|Polish Livonia]] was divided into:\n* [[Wenden Voivodeship]] (''wojew\u00f3dztwo wende\u0144skie'', [[Kie\u015b]])\n* [[Dorpat Voivodeship]] (''wojew\u00f3dztwo dorpackie'', [[Dorpat]])\n* [[Parnawa Voivodeship]] (''wojew\u00f3dztwo parnawskie'', [[Parnawa]])\n\n==Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth==\n{{Main|Duchy of Livonia}}\n[[File:Rzeczpospolita2nar.png|thumb|left|left|150x|Outline of the Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\n[[File:sweden2.gif|thumb|right|120px|Formation of the Swedish Empire, 1560\u20131660]]\nDuring 1582\u201383 southern Estonia ([[Livonia]]) became part of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]].\n\n==Estonia in the Swedish Empire==\n{{Main|Swedish Estonia}}\nThe [[Duchy of Estonia (1561\u20131721)|Duchy of Estonia]] placed itself under Swedish rule in 1561 to receive protection against [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russia]] and [[Poland]] as the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword|Livonian Order]] lost their foothold in the Baltic provinces. Territorially it represented the northern part of present-day Estonia.\n\n[[Swedish Livonia|Livonia]] was conquered from the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] by 1629 in the [[Polish\u2013Swedish War (1626\u201329)|Polish\u2013Swedish War]]. By the [[Treaty of Oliva]] between the Commonwealth and Sweden in 1660 following the [[Northern Wars]] the [[House of Vasa|Polish\u2013Lithuanian king]] renounced all claims to the Swedish throne and Livonia was formally ceded to Sweden. Swedish Livonia represents the southern part of present-day Estonia and the northern part of present-day [[Latvia]] ([[Vidzeme]] region).\n\nIn 1631, [[Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden|Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden]] forced the nobility to grant the peasantry greater [[autonomy]], and in 1632 established a [[printing press]] and [[University of Tartu|university]] in the city of [[Tartu]].\n\n==Estonia in the Russian Empire (1710\u20131917)==\n[[File:Europa1899.JPG|150px|thumb|Europe in 19th century]]\n\nSweden's defeat by Russia in the [[Great Northern War]] resulted in the [[capitulation of Estonia and Livonia]] in 1710, confirmed by the [[Treaty of Nystad]] in 1721, and Russian rule was then imposed on what later became modern Estonia. Nonetheless, the legal system, [[Lutheran]] church, local and town governments, and education remained mostly German until the late 19th century and partially until 1918.\n\nThe Russian era from the 1720s to the [[First World War]] was the golden age of the German elites. They owned most of the land and businesses, controlled the [[serfs]], dominated all the cities, and got along quite well with the Russian imperial authorities.  Unrest and rebellion was uncommon. The Germans were Lutherans, and so were the vast majority of the Estonian population, but the Germans had full control of the Lutheran churches. [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] Protestant missionaries made an impact in the eighteenth century, and translated the complete Bible into Estonian. The Germans complained, so the imperial government banned the Moravians from 1743 to 1764. A theological faculty opened at the [[University of Dorpat]] (Tartu), with German professors. The local German gentry controlled the local churches and rarely hired Estonian graduates, but they made their mark as intellectuals and Estonian nationalists. In the 1840s, there was a movement of Lutheran peasants into the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. The [[tsardom of Russia|czar]] discouraged them when he realized they were challenging the local authorities.<ref>Kenneth Scott Latourette, ''Christianity in a Revolutionary Age'' (195) 197\u201398</ref> The German character of the Lutheran churches alienated many nationalists, who emphasized the secular in their subcultures. For example, [[choral societies]] offered a secular alternative to church music.<ref>Hank Johnston, \"Religion and Nationalist Subcultures in the Baltics,\" ''[[Journal of Baltic Studies]]'' (1992) 23#2 pp 133\u2013148.</ref>\n \n[[File:Album von Dorpat, TKM 0031H 05, crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[University of Tartu|Tartu University]] (Universit\u00e4t Dorpat) in 1860, during its 'Golden Age']]\n\nBy 1819, the [[Baltic provinces]] were the first in the Russian empire in which serfdom was abolished, the largely autonomous nobility allowing the peasants to own their own land or move to the cities. These moves created the economic foundation for the coming to life of the local national identity and culture as Estonia was caught in a current of national awakening that began sweeping through Europe in the mid-19th century.\n\nTartu was a multicultural crossroads with strong representation of Russians, Germans and Estonians. Orthodox, Lutherans and [[Jews]], scientists and humanists, all were quite active at the city's [[University of Tartu|university]]. The students seemed uninterested in the [[Russification]] programs introduced in the 1890s.<ref>{{cite book| author=Neil Taylor| title=Baltic Cities| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNsH-uJkUekC&pg=PA84| year=2008| publisher=[[Bradt Travel Guides]] | pages=84\u201385}}</ref>\n\n===The Estophile enlightenment period (1750\u20131840)===\n{{Main|Estophilia}}\n\nEducated German immigrants and local [[Baltic Germans]] in Estonia, educated at German universities, introduced [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment ideas]] of rational thinking, ideas that propagated freedom of thinking and brotherhood and equality.

Although Baltic Germans by and large regarded the future of the Estonians as being a fusion with the Baltic Germans, the Estophile educated class admired the ancient culture of the Estonians and their era of freedom before the conquests by Danes and Germans in the 13th century.<ref>{{Harvnb|Subrenat|2004|p=84}}</ref> The Estophile Enlightenment Period formed the transition from religious Estonian literature to newspapers written in Estonian for the mass public.\n\n===National awakening===\n{{Main|Estonian national awakening}}\nA cultural movement sprang forth to adopt the use of [[Estonian language|Estonian]] as the language of instruction in schools, all-Estonian song festivals were held regularly after 1869, and a national literature in Estonian developed. ''[[Kalevipoeg]]'', Estonia's national epic, was published in 1861 in both Estonian and German.\n\n1889 marked the beginning of the central government-sponsored policy of [[Russification]]. The impact of this was that many of the [[Baltic German]] legal institutions were either abolished or had to do their work in Russian \u2013 a good example of this is the [[University of Tartu]].\n\nAs the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] swept through Estonia, the Estonians called for [[freedom of the press]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], for universal [[suffrage|franchise]], and for national autonomy. Estonian gains were minimal, but the tense stability that prevailed between 1905 and 1917 allowed Estonians to advance the aspiration of national statehood.\n\n==Road to the republic (1917\u20131920)==\n{{Main|Diplomatic history of World War I#Three Baltic states|Autonomous Governorate of Estonia|Commune of the Working People of Estonia}}\n[[File:Estonian Declaration of Independence.jpg|right|thumb|150px|[[Estonian Declaration of Independence]]]]\nEstonia as a unified political entity first emerged after the Russian [[February Revolution]] of 1917. With the collapse of the [[Russian Empire]] in [[World War I]], [[Russian Provisional Government|Russia's Provisional Government]] granted national autonomy to a [[Autonomous Governorate of Estonia|unified Estonia]] in April. The [[Governorate of Estonia]] in the north (corresponding to the historic [[Danish Estonia]]) was united with the northern part of the [[Governorate of Livonia]]. Elections for a provisional parliament, ''[[Maap\u00e4ev]]'', was organized, with the [[Menshevik]] and [[Bolshevik]] factions of the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]] obtaining a part of the vote. On 5 November 1917, two days before the [[October Revolution]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], Estonian Bolshevik leader [[Jaan Anvelt]] violently usurped power from the legally constituted Maap\u00e4ev in a coup d'\u00e9tat, forcing the Maap\u00e4ev underground.\n\nIn February, after the collapse of the peace talks between Soviet Russia and the [[German Empire]], mainland Estonia was occupied by the Germans. Bolshevik forces retreated to Russia. Between the Russian [[Red Army]]'s retreat and the arrival of advancing German troops, the [[Salvation Committee]] of the Estonian National Council Maap\u00e4ev issued the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence]]<ref name=\"EDoI1918\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.president.ee/en/estonia/ |title=Estonian Declaration of Independence |date=24 February 1918 |work=www.president.ee |publisher=Estonian National Council |accessdate=2009-09-20 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090522173844/http://www.president.ee/en/estonia/ |archivedate=22 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> in [[P\u00e4rnu]] on 23 February 1918.\n\n===War of Independence===\n{{Main|German occupation of Estonia during World War I|Estonian War of Independence}}\n[[File:EstArmyHighCommnd1920.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The Estonian Army High Command in 1920]]\nAfter the collapse of the short-lived [[puppet government]] of the [[United Baltic Duchy]] and the withdrawal of German troops in November 1918, an [[Estonian Provisional Government]] retook office. A military invasion by the Red Army followed a few days later, however, marking the beginning of the [[Estonian War of Independence]] (1918\u20131920). The Estonian army cleared the entire territory of Estonia of the Red Army by February 1919. On 5\u20137 April 1919 the [[Estonian Constituent Assembly]] was elected.\n\n===Victory===\n[[File:TallinnWarMemorial2009.JPG|thumb|100px|right|[[War of Independence Victory Column|Victory Column]]]]\nOn 2 February 1920, the [[Treaty of Tartu (Russian\u2013Estonian)|Treaty of Tartu]] was signed by the Republic of Estonia and the [[Russian SFSR]]. The terms of the treaty stated that Russia renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia. The first [[Constitution of Estonia]] was adopted on 15 June 1920. The Republic of Estonia obtained international recognition and became a member of the [[League of Nations]] in 1921.\n\nIn nearby [[History of Finland|Finland]] similar circumstances resulted in a bloody civil war. Despite repeated threats from fascist movements, Finland became and remained a free democracy under the rule of law. By contrast Estonia, without a civil war, started as a democracy and was turned into a dictatorship in 1934.<ref>Alan Siaroff, \"Democratic Breakdown and Democratic Stability: A Comparison of Interwar Estonia and Finland,\" ''[[Canadian Journal of Political Science]]'' Vol. 32, No. 1 (Mar. 1999), pp. 103\u2013124 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3232774 in JSTOR]</ref>\n\n==Interwar period (1920\u20131939)==\n{{Main|History of Estonia (1920\u201339)}}\n[[File:Tallinn-Helsinki_1936_Aegna.jpg|thumb|right|Shipping poster from 1936]]\n[[File:VapsMovement.jpg|thumb|right|250px| [[Vaps Movement]] meeting in [[P\u00e4rnu]], [[Artur Sirk]] speaking]]\nThe first period of independence lasted 22 years, beginning in 1918. Estonia underwent a number of economic, social, and political reforms necessary to come to terms with its new status as a [[sovereign state]]. Economically and socially, [[land reform]] in 1919 was the most important step. Large estate holdings belonging to the [[Baltic nobility]] were redistributed among the peasants and especially among volunteers in the [[Estonian War of Independence]]. Estonia's principal markets became [[Scandinavia]], the United Kingdom, and western Europe, with some exports to the United States and to the [[Soviet Union]].\n\nThe first constitution of the Republic of Estonia, adopted in 1920, established a [[parliamentary]] form of government. The parliament (''[[Riigikogu]]'') consisted of 100 members elected for three-year terms. Between 1920 and 1934, Estonia had 21 governments.\n\nA mass anticommunist and antiparliamentary [[Vaps Movement]] emerged in the 1930s.<ref name=\"EBVaps\">{{Cite web| url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/623213/Vaps| title=Vaps| year = 2009| work=[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]| publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online|accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref> In October 1933 a [[referendum]] on constitutional reform initiated by the Vaps Movement was approved by 72.7 percent.<ref name=\"EBVaps\"/> The league spearheaded replacement of the parliamentary system with a [[presidential system|presidential form of government]] and laid the groundwork for an April 1934 presidential election, which it expected to win. However, the Vaps Movement was thwarted by a pre-emptive coup d'\u00e9tat on 12 March 1934, by [[Head of State of Estonia|Head of State]] [[Konstantin P\u00e4ts]], who then established his own authoritarian rule until a new constitution came to force. During the [[Era of Silence]], political parties were banned, and the parliament was not in session between 1934 and 1938 as the country was [[rule by decree|ruled by decree]] by P\u00e4ts. The Vaps Movement was officially banned and finally disbanded in December 1935. On 6 May 1936, 150 members of the league went on trial and 143 of them were convicted to long-term prison sentences. They were granted an [[amnesty]] and freed in 1938, by which time the league had lost most of its popular support.\n\nThe interwar period was one of great cultural advancement.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} Estonian language schools were established, and artistic life of all kinds flourished. One of the more notable cultural acts of the independence period, unique in western Europe at the time of its passage in 1925, was a guarantee of cultural autonomy to [[minority group]]s comprising at least 3,000 persons, including [[Jew]]s (see [[history of the Jews in Estonia]]). Historians see the lack of any bloodshed after a nearly \"700-year German rule\" as indication that it must have been mild by comparison.\n\nEstonia had pursued a policy of [[country neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]], but it was of no consequence after the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Nazi Germany]] signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]] on 23 August 1939. In the agreement, the two great powers agreed to divide up the countries situated between them ([[Poland]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], Estonia, and [[Finland]]), with Estonia falling in the Soviet \"[[sphere of influence]]\". After the invasion of Poland, the [[Orze\u0142 incident]] took place when Polish submarine [[ORP Orze\u0142 (1938)|ORP ''Orze\u0142'']] looked for shelter in [[Tallinn]] but escaped after the Soviet Union attacked Poland on 17 September. Estonia's lack of will and/or inability to disarm and intern the crew caused the Soviet Union to accuse Estonia of \"helping them escape\" and claim that Estonia was not neutral. On 24 September 1939, the Soviet Union threatened Estonia with war unless provided with military bases in the country\u2014an ultimatum with which the Estonian government complied.\n\n==World War II (1939\u20131944)==\n{{Main|Occupation of the Baltic states}}\nFollowing the conclusion of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]], warships of the [[Red Navy]] appeared off Estonian ports on 24 September 1939, and Soviet bombers began a threatening patrol over [[Tallinn]] and the nearby countryside.<ref name=\"TM091939\">{{Cite journal|date=9 October 1939|title=RUSSIA: Moscow's Week|journal=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,762664,00.html|accessdate=2009-09-20|ref=harv}}</ref> Moscow demanded Estonia assent to an agreement which allowed the USSR to establish military bases and station 25,000 troops on Estonian soil for the duration of the European war.<ref>{{harvnb|Smith|Pabriks|Purs|Lane|2002|p=24}}</ref> The government of Estonia accepted the ultimatum, signing the corresponding agreement on 28 September 1939.\n\n===Soviet occupation (1940)===\n{{See also|Soviet deportations from Estonia|Occupation and annexation of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union (1940)}}\n\nThe Republic of Estonia was [[occupation of the Baltic states|occupied]] by the Soviet Union in June 1940.<ref>{{Cite book\n| title = The World Book Encyclopedia\n| year = 2003\n| publisher = [[World Book]]\n| location = Chicago, IL\n| isbn = 0-7166-0103-6\n| page =\n}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book\n| last = O'Connor\n| first = Kevin J.\n| title = The History of the Baltic States\n| year = 2003\n| publisher = [[Greenwood Press]]\n| location = Westport, Conn.\n| isbn = 0-313-32355-0\n| pages =\n}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.vm.ee/est/kat_533/7728.html |title=Molotovi\u2013Ribbentropi pakt ja selle tagaj\u00e4rjed |date=22 August 2006 |publisher=Estonian Ministry of Foreign Affairs |language=Estonian |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707164549/http://www.vm.ee/est/kat_533/7728.html |archivedate=7 July 2007 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 12 June 1940, the order for a total military [[blockade]] of Estonia by the Soviet [[Baltic Fleet]] was given.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.mil.fi/laitokset/tiedotteet/1282.dsp| title=Kaleva-koneen tuhosta uutta tietoa| date=14 June 2005| work=www.mil.fi| publisher=Finnish Defence Forces| language=Finnish| accessdate=2009-09-20| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821221643/http://www.mil.fi/laitokset/tiedotteet/1282.dsp| archive-date=21 August 2009| url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.rusin.fi/publications/warinpetsamo/indexEN.html |title=documents published |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080205065414/http://www.rusin.fi/publications/warinpetsamo/indexEN.html |archivedate=5 February 2008|language=ru}} from the State Archive of the Russian Navy</ref>\n\nOn 14 June 1940, while the world's attention was focused on the fall of Paris to [[Nazi Germany]] a day earlier, the Soviet military blockade of Estonia went into effect, and two Soviet bombers downed Finnish passenger airplane [[Kaleva (airplane)|''Kaleva'']] flying from Tallinn to [[Helsinki]] carrying three diplomatic pouches from the U.S. legations in Tallinn, [[Riga]] and Helsinki.

With the Allied victory over Germany becoming certain in 1944, the only option to save Estonia's independence was to stave off a new Soviet invasion of Estonia until Germany's capitulation.\n\nBy January 1944, the front was pushed back by the Soviet Army almost all the way to the former Estonian border. [[Narva]] was evacuated. [[J\u00fcri Uluots]], the last legitimate prime minister of the Republic of Estonia (according to the Constitution of the Republic of Estonia) prior to its fall to the Soviet Union in 1940, delivered a radio address that implored all able-bodied men born from 1904 through 1923 to report for military service. (Before this, Uluots had opposed Estonian mobilization.) The call drew support from all across the country: 38,000 volunteers jammed registration centers.<ref>{{Cite book\n| last1 = Lande\n| first1 = David A.\n| title = Resistance!

The Estonian units saw action defending the [[Battle of Narva (1944)|Narva line]] throughout 1944.\n\nAs the Germans started to retreat on 18 September 1944, [[J\u00fcri Uluots]], the last Prime Minister of the Estonian Republic prior to Soviet occupation, assumed the responsibilities of president (as dictated in the Constitution) and appointed a new government while seeking recognition from the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. On 22 September 1944, as the last German units pulled out of Tallinn, the city was re-occupied by the Soviet Red Army. The new Estonian government fled to [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]], and [[Estonian government-in-exile|operated in exile]] from 1944 until 1992, when [[Heinrich Mark]], the prime minister of the Estonian government in exile acting as president, presented his credentials to incoming president [[Lennart Meri]].\n\n====The Holocaust in Estonia====\n{{Main|The Holocaust in Estonia|History of the Jews in Estonia}}\nThe process of Jewish settlement in Estonia began in the 19th century, when in 1865 Russian Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]] granted them the right to enter the region. The creation of the Republic of Estonia in 1918 marked the beginning of a new era for the Jews. Approximately 200 Jews fought in combat for the creation of the Republic of Estonia, and 70 of these men were volunteers. From the very first days of its existence as a state, Estonia showed tolerance towards all the peoples inhabiting its territories.{{citation needed|date=April 2019}} On 12 February 1925, the Estonian government passed a law pertaining to the cultural autonomy of minority peoples. The Jewish community quickly prepared its application for cultural autonomy. Statistics on Jewish citizens were compiled. They totaled 3,045, fulfilling the minimum requirement of 3,000. In June 1926 the Jewish Cultural Council was elected and Jewish cultural autonomy was declared. Jewish cultural autonomy was of great interest to the global Jewish community. The Jewish National Endowment presented the [[Government of the Republic of Estonia]] with a certificate of gratitude for this achievement.<ref name=\"jewishvirtuallibrary\">{{Cite web| url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Estonia.html?title=Jews_in_Estonia| title=The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Estonia| work=[[Jewish Virtual Library]]| accessdate=2009-09-20}}</ref>\n\nThere were, at the time of Soviet occupation in 1940, approximately 2,000 Estonian Jews. Many Jewish people were deported to Siberia along with other Estonians by the Soviets. It is estimated that 500 Jews suffered this fate. With the invasion of the Baltics, it was the intention of the Nazi government to use the Baltic countries as their main area of mass [[genocide]]. Consequently, Jews from countries outside the Baltics were shipped there to be exterminated.

More than 30,000 soldiers had been killed in action. In 1944 Russian [[airstrike|air raids]] had destroyed [[Narva]] and one-third of the residential area in [[Tallinn]]. By the late autumn of 1944, Soviet forces had ushered in a second phase of Soviet rule on the heels of the German troops withdrawing from Estonia, and followed it up by a new wave of arrests and executions of people considered disloyal to the Soviets.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}\n\n[[File:SovietPrisonDoorsTallinn.JPG|thumb|right|Soviet prison doors on display in the Museum of Occupation, Tallinn]]\nAn anti-Soviet [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] movement known as the [[Forest Brothers|''Metsavennad'' (\"Forest Brothers\")]] developed in the countryside, reaching its zenith in 1946\u201348. It is hard to tell how many people were in the ranks of the ''Metsavennad''; however, it is estimated that at different times there could have been about 30,000\u201335,000 people. Probably [[August Sabbe|the last Forest Brother]] was caught in September 1978, and killed himself during his apprehension.\n\nIn March 1949, 20,722 people (2.5% of the population) were deported to Siberia. By the beginning of the 1950s, the occupying regime had suppressed the resistance movement.\n\nAfter the war the Communist Party of the [[Estonian SSR|Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (ECP) became the pre-eminent organization in the republic. The ethnic Estonian share in the total ECP membership decreased from 90% in 1941 to 48% in 1952.\n\n[[File:Flag of the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic.svg|thumb|[[Flag of the Estonian SSR]]]]\n\n=== Khrushchev era ===\n{{See also|Khrushchev Thaw}}\nAfter [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]]'s death, Communist Party membership vastly expanded its social base to include more ethnic Estonians. By the mid-1960s, the percentage of ethnic Estonian membership stabilized near 50%. On the eve of [[perestroika]] the ECP claimed about 100,000 members; less than half were ethnic Estonians and they totalled less than 7% of the country's population.\n\nOne positive aspect of the post-Stalin era in Estonia was the regranting of permission in the late 1950s for citizens to make contact with foreign countries. Ties were reactivated with [[Finland]], and in the 1960s, a ferry connection was opened from Tallinn to [[Helsinki]] and Estonians began watching Finnish television. This electronic \"window on the West\" afforded Estonians more information on current affairs and more access to Western culture and thought than any other group in the Soviet Union. This heightened media environment was important in preparing Estonians for their vanguard role in extending perestroika during the [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] era.\n\n==== Capital investments ====\nIn 1955 the TV Centre was built in Tallinn; it began TV broadcasts on 29 June of that year.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.rustrana.ru/print.php?nid=515| script-title=ru:\u0418\u0441\u0442\u043e\u0440\u0438\u044f \u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0434\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f| date=11 October 2007| work=www.rustrana.ru| language=Russian| accessdate=2009-09-20| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090110101628/http://www.rustrana.ru/print.php?nid=515| archive-date=10 January 2009| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref> The [[Tallinn Song Festival Grounds]], the venue for the song festivals, were built in 1960.<ref>{{Cite web| url=http://www.utlib.ee/fonoteek/IAML2003/laulu.htm| title=Tallinn Song Grounds| work=www.utlib.ee| accessdate=2009-09-20| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080117214936/http://www.utlib.ee/fonoteek/IAML2003/laulu.htm| archive-date=17 January 2008| url-status=dead| df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==== Health care ====\nOnly after the [[Khrushchev Thaw]] period of 1956 did healthcare networks start to stabilise.

(In comparison, in Finland during the same period, consumption was only 6\u20137 litres per person per annum.)\n\n=== Gorbachev era ===\n{{See also|Perestroika|Glasnost}}\nBy the beginning of the Gorbachev era, concern over the cultural survival of the Estonian people had reached a critical point. The ECP remained stable in the early perestroika years but waned in the late 1980s. Other political movements, groupings and parties moved to fill the power vacuum. The first and most important was the [[Estonian Popular Front]], established in April 1988 with its own platform, leadership and broad constituency. The [[Estonian Greens|Greens]] and the dissident-led [[Estonian National Independence Party]] soon followed.\n\n== Restoration of ''de facto'' independence ==\nThe [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration]] was issued on 16 November 1988.<ref>{{Cite book| title=Dissent and Opposition in Communist Eastern Europe |last=Pollack |first=Detlef |authorlink= |author2=Jan Wielgohs |year=2004 |publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]] |location= |isbn=978-0-7546-3790-5 |page=134 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=ZoYgF9oCvOcC&pg=PA134&dq }}</ref> By 1989 the political spectrum had widened, and new parties were formed and re-formed almost daily. The republic's [[Supreme Soviet]] transformed into an authentic regional lawmaking body. This relatively conservative legislature passed an early declaration of sovereignty (16 November 1988); a law on economic independence (May 1989) confirmed by the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] that November; a language law making Estonian the [[official language]] (January 1989); and local and republic election laws stipulating residency requirements for voting and candidacy (August, November 1989).\n\nDespite the emergence of the Popular Front and the Supreme Soviet as a new lawmaking body, since 1989 the different segments of the indigenous Estonian population had been politically mobilized by different and competing actors. The Popular Front's proposal to declare the independence of Estonia as a new, so-called \"third republic\" whose citizens would be all those living there at the moment, found less and less support over time.\n\nA grassroots [[Estonian Citizens' Committees]] Movement launched in 1989 with the objective of registering all pre-war citizens of the Republic of Estonia and their descendants in order to convene a [[Congress of Estonia]]. Their emphasis was on the illegal nature of the Soviet system and that hundreds of thousands of inhabitants of Estonia had not ceased to be citizens of the Estonian Republic which still existed ''de jure'', recognized by the majority of Western nations. Despite the hostility of the mainstream official press and intimidation by Soviet Estonian authorities, dozens of local citizens' committees were elected by popular initiative all over the country. These quickly organized into a nationwide structure, and by the beginning of 1990 over 900,000 people had registered themselves as citizens of the Republic of Estonia.\n\nThe spring of 1990 saw two free elections and two alternative legislatures developed in Estonia. On 24 February 1990, the 464-member Congress of Estonia (including 35 delegates of refugee communities abroad) was elected by the registered citizens of the republic. The Congress of Estonia convened for the first time in Tallinn 11\u201312 March 1990, passing 14 declarations and resolutions. A 70-member standing committee ([[Eesti Komitee]]) was elected with [[Tunne Kelam]] as its chairman.\n\nIn March 1991 a referendum was held on the issue of independence. This was somewhat controversial, as holding a referendum could be taken as signalling that Estonian independence would be established rather than \"re\"-established. There was some discussion about whether it was appropriate to allow the Russian immigrant minority to vote, or if this decision should be reserved exclusively for citizens of Estonia. In the end all major political parties backed the referendum, considering it most important to send a strong signal to the world. To further legitimise the vote, all residents of Estonia were allowed to participate. The result vindicated these decisions, as the referendum produced a strong endorsement for independence. Turnout was 82%, and 64% of all possible voters in the country backed independence, with only 17% against.\n\nAlthough the majority of Estonia's large Russian-speaking diaspora of Soviet-era immigrants did not support full independence, they were divided in their goals for the republic. In March 1990 some 18% of Russian speakers supported the idea of a fully independent Estonia, up from 7% the previous autumn, and by early 1990 only a small minority of ethnic Estonians were opposed to full independence.\n\nIn the 18 March 1990, elections for the 105-member Supreme Soviet, all residents of Estonia were eligible to participate, including all Soviet-era immigrants from the U.S.S.R. and approximately 50,000 Soviet troops stationed there. The Popular Front coalition, composed of [[Left-wing politics|left]] and [[centrism|centrist parties]] and led by former [[Central Planning Committee]] official [[Edgar Savisaar]], gained a parliamentary majority.\n\n[[File:Toompea castle house of parliament.JPG|thumb|Toompea castle \u2013 the seat of the [[Riigikogu]]]]\n\nOn 8 May 1990, the Supreme Council of the Republic of Estonia (renamed the previous day) changed the name to the Republic of Estonia. Through a strict, non-confrontational policy in pursuing independence, Estonia managed to avoid the violence which [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]] incurred in the bloody January 1991 crackdowns and in the border customs-post guard murders that summer. During the attempted [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|August coup]] in the U.S.S.R., Estonia was able to maintain constant operation and control of its telecommunications facilities, thereby offering the West a clear view into the latest developments and serving as a conduit for swift Western support and recognition of Estonia's \"confirmation\" of independence on 20 August 1991. 20 August remains a national holiday in Estonia because of this. Following Europe's lead, the United States formally reestablished diplomatic relations with Estonia on 2 September, and the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] offered recognition on 6 September.\n\nSince the debates about whether the future independent Estonia would be established as a new republic or a continuation of the first republic were not yet complete by the time of the August coup, while the members of the Supreme Soviet generally agreed that independence should be declared rapidly, a compromise was hatched between the two main sides: instead of \"declaring\" independence, which would imply a new start, or explicitly asserting continuity, the declaration would \"confirm\" Estonia as a state independent of the Soviet Union, and willing to reestablish diplomatic relations of its own accord. The text of the statement was in Estonian and only a few paragraphs in length.<ref name=\"decl\">A.

Since fully regaining independence Estonia has had fifteen governments with ten prime ministers: [[Mart Laar]], [[Andres Tarand]], [[Tiit V\u00e4hi]], [[Mart Siimann]], [[Siim Kallas]], [[Juhan Parts]], [[Andrus Ansip]], [[Taavi R\u00f5ivas]] and [[J\u00fcri Ratas]]. The PMs of the interim government (1990\u20131992) were [[Edgar Savisaar]] and Tiit V\u00e4hi.\n\nSince the last Russian troops left in 1994, Estonia has been free to promote economic and political ties with Western Europe. Estonia opened accession negotiations with the [[European Union]] in 1998 and joined in 2004, shortly after becoming a member of [[NATO]].\n\n== Contemporary Estonian government (1992\u2013present)==\n[[File:Registration card for Estonian citizenship from 1989.JPG|thumb|Registration card for Estonian citizenship from 1989]]\n{{see also|Politics of Estonia|Elections in Estonia}}\nOn 28 June 1992, Estonian voters approved the constitutional assembly's draft constitution and implementation act, which established a parliamentary government with a president as chief of state and with a government headed by a prime minister. The [[Riigikogu]], a unicameral legislative body, is the highest organ of state authority. It initiates and approves legislation sponsored by the prime minister. The prime minister has full responsibility and control over his cabinet.\n\n=== Meri presidency and Laar premiership (1992\u20132001) ===\nParliamentary and presidential elections were held on 20 September 1992. Approximately 68% of the country's 637,000 registered voters cast ballots. [[Lennart Meri]], an outstanding writer and former [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (Estonia)|Minister of Foreign Affairs]], won this election and became [[President of Estonia|president]]. He chose 32-year-old historian and [[Party of Estonian Christian Democrats|Christian Democratic Party]] founder [[Mart Laar]] as prime minister.\n\nIn February 1992, and with amendments in January 1995, the Riigikogu renewed Estonia's 1938 citizenship law, which also provides equal civil protection to resident aliens. Elected on an ambitious programme of reform, Mart Laar's cabinet took several decisive measures ([[Shock therapy (economics)|Shock therapy]]). Fast privatization was pursued and the role of the state in the economy as well as in the social affairs was reduced dramatically. After an initial steep decline in GDP, the Estonian economy started to grow again in 1995. Changes came with a social price: the [[average life expectancy]] in Estonia in 1994 was lower than in Belarus, Ukraine and even Moldova.<ref>[https://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=d5bncppjof8f9_&hl=en&dl=en#!ctype=l&strail=false&bcs=d&nselm=h&met_y=sp_dyn_le00_in&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&rdim=region&idim=country:EST:BLR:MDA:RUS:UKR:LVA:LTU&ifdim=region&tstart=-314157600000&tend=1358460000000&hl=en_US&dl=en&ind=false World Development Indicators]</ref> Among the vulnerable sectors of society, the radical reforms sparked an outrage. In January 1993, a pensioners' [[demonstration (protest)|demonstration]] took place in Tallinn, as pensioners felt it was impossible to live with a pension as low as the one in effect at the time (260 EEK (around 20 EUR) a month<ref>http://www.baltic-course.com/rus/_analytics/?doc=57563</ref>). The meeting was aggressive and demonstrators attacked the minister of social affairs [[Marju Lauristin]].<ref>[http://m.epl.delfi.ee/article.php?id=50806224 K\u00fcmme aastat uut Eestit, 1993] Eesti P\u00e4evaleht, 14. juuli 2001.</ref>\n\nThe opposition won the 1995 election, but to a large extent continued with the previous governments' policies.\n\nIn 1996, Estonia ratified a border agreement with Latvia and completed work with Russia on a technical border agreement. President Meri was re-elected in free and fair indirect elections in August and September in 1996. During parliamentary elections in 1999, the seats in the Riigikogu were divided as follows: the [[Estonian Centre Party]] received 28, the [[Pro Patria Union]] 18, the [[Estonian Reform Party]] 18, the People's Party Moderates (election cartel between Moderates and People's Party) 17, Coalition Party 7, Country People's Party (now [[People's Union of Estonia]]) 7, and the United People's Party's electoral cartel 6 seats. Pro Patria Union, the Reform Party, and the Moderates formed a government with Mart Laar as prime minister, whereas the Centre Party with the Coalition Party, People's Union, United People's Party, and members of parliament who were not members of factions formed the opposition in the Riigikogu.\n\nThe [[1999 Estonian parliamentary election|1999 Parliamentary election]], with a 5% threshold and no electoral cartel allowed, resulted in a disaster for the Coalition Party, which achieved only seven seats together with two of its smaller allies. Estonian Ruralfolk Party, which participated the election on its own list, obtained seven seats as well.\n\nThe programme of Mart Laar's government was signed by Pro Patria Union, the Reform Party, the Moderates, and the People's Party. The latter two merged soon after, so Mart Laar's second government is widely known as ''Kolmikliit'', or the Tripartite coalition. Notwithstanding the different political orientation of the ruling parties, the coalition stayed united until Laar resigned in December 2001, after the Reform Party had broken up the same coalition in Tallinn municipality, making opposition leader [[Edgar Savisaar]] the new mayor of Tallinn. After the resignation of Laar, the Reform Party and Estonian Centre Party formed a coalition that lasted until the next parliamentary election, in 2003.\n\nThe Moderates joined with the People's Party on 27 November 1999, forming the People's Party Moderates.\n\n=== R\u00fc\u00fctel presidency and Siim Kallas government (2001\u20132002) ===\nIn fall 2001 [[Arnold R\u00fc\u00fctel]] became the President of the Republic of Estonia, and in January 2002 Prime Minister Laar stepped down.

With 64% of the electorate turning out, the referendum passed with a 66.83% margin in favor, 33.17% against. Accession to the EU took place on 1 May of the following year.\n\nIn February 2004 the People's Party Moderates renamed themselves the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party of Estonia]].\n\nOn 8 May 2004, a defection of several Centre Party members to form a new party, the Social Liberal Party, over a row concerning the Centrists' \"no\" stance to joining the European Union changed the allocation of the seats in the Riigikogu. Social-liberals had eight seats, but a hope to form a new party disappeared by 10 May 2005, because most members in the social-liberal group joined other parties.\n\n===Andrus Ansip government (2004)===\nOn 24 March Prime Minister [[Juhan Parts]] announced his resignation following a vote of [[no confidence]] in the Riigikogu against [[Ministry of Justice (Estonia)|Minister of Justice]] [[Ken-Marti Vaher]], which was held on 21 March. The result was 54 pro (Social Democrats, Social Liberals, People's Union, Pro Patria Union and Reform Party) with no against or neutral MPs. 32 MPs (Res Publica and Centre Party) did not take part.\n\nOn 4 April 2005, President R\u00fc\u00fctel nominated Reform party leader [[Andrus Ansip]] as Prime Minister designate and asked him to form a new government, the eighth in twelve years. Ansip formed a government out of a coalition of his Reform Party with the People's Union and the Centre Party. Approval by the Riigikogu, which by law must decide within 14 days of his nomination, came on 12 April 2005. Ansip was backed by 53 out of 101 members of the Estonian parliament. Forty deputies voted against his candidature. The general consensus in the Estonian media seems to be that the new [[Andrus Ansip's cabinet|cabinet]], on the level of competence, is not necessarily an improvement over the old one.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nOn 18 May 2005, Estonia signed a border treaty with the [[Russian Federation]] in Moscow. The treaty was ratified by the Riigikogu on 20 June 2005. However, in the end of June the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs informed that it did not intend to become a party to the border treaty and did not consider itself bound by the circumstances concerning the object and the purposes of the treaty because the Riigikogu had attached a preambule to the ratification act that referenced earlier documents that mentioned the Soviet occupation and the uninterrupted legal continuity of the Republic of Estonia during the Soviet period. The issue remains unsolved and is the focus of European-level discussions.\n\nOn 4 April 2006, Fatherland Union and Res Publica decided to form a united right-conservative party. The two parties joining was approved on 4 June by both parties in P\u00e4rnu. The joined party name is Isamaa ja Res Publica Liit ([[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]]).\n\n=== 2007 elections ===\nThe [[2007 Estonian parliamentary election|2007 parliamentary elections]] have shown an improvement in the scores of the Reform Party, gaining 12 seats and reaching 31 MPs; the Centre Party held, while the unified right-conservative [[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]] lost 16. Socialdemocrats gained 4 seats, while the Greens entered the Parliaments with 7 seats, at the expense of the agrarian [[People's Union of Estonia|People's Union]] which lost 6. The new configuration of the Estonian Parliament shows a prevalence of centre-left parties. The Centre Party, led by the mayor of Tallinn [[Edgar Savisaar]], has been increasingly excluded from collaboration, since his open collaboration with [[Vladimir Putin|Putin]]'s [[United Russia]] party, real estate scandals in Tallinn,<ref name=\"savisaarrealestate\">[http://www.delfi.ee/archive/article.php?id=11378593 Savisaar's and Kruuda's mutual gifts]</ref> and the [[Bronze Soldier]] controversy, considered as a deliberate attempt of splitting the Estonian society by provoking the Russian minority.<ref name=\"splitter\">[http://postimees.ee/300407/esileht/arvamus/257922.php L\u00f5hestaja number \u00fcks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071006120354/http://www.postimees.ee/300407/esileht/arvamus/257922.php |date=6 October 2007 }} Postimees</ref> The lack of a concrete possibility for government alternance in Estonia has been quoted as a concern.<ref name=presseurop/>\n\n=== Estonia and the European Union ===\nOn 14 September 2003, following negotiations that began in 1998, the citizens of Estonia were asked in a referendum whether or not they wished to join the [[European Union]]. With 64% of the electorate turning out the referendum passed with a 66.83% margin in favor, 33.17% against. Accession to the EU took place on 1 May of the following year.\n\nIn its [[2004 European Parliament election in Estonia|first European Parliament elections in 2004]], [[Estonia (European Parliament constituency)|Estonia]] elected three [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] for the [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party]] (PES), while the governing [[Res Publica Party]] and [[People's Union of Estonia|People's Union]] polled poorly, not being able to gain any of the other three MEP posts. The [[voter turnout]] in Estonia was one of the lowest of all member countries, at only 26.8%. A similar trend was visible in most of the new member states that joined the EU in 2004.\n\nThe [[2009 European Parliament election|European Parliament election of 2009 in Estonia]] scored a 43.9% turnout \u2013 about 17.1% higher than during the [[2004 European Parliament election in Estonia|previous election]], and slightly above the European average of 42.94%. Six seats were up for taking in this election: two of them were won by the [[Estonian Centre Party]]. [[Estonian Reform Party]], [[Union of Pro Patria and Res Publica]], [[Social Democratic Party (Estonia)|Social Democratic Party]] and an independent candidate [[Indrek Tarand]] (who gathered the support of 102,460 voters, only 1,046 votes less than the winner of the election) all won one seat each. The success of independent candidates has been attributed both to general disillusionment with major parties and the use of closed lists which rendered voters incapable of casting a vote for specific candidates in party lists.\n\nOn 1 January 2011 Estonia adopted the [[euro]]. The enlargement of the [[eurozone]] was hailed as a good sign in a period of global financial crisis. However, the government cut down public service salaries; the only opposition, in the absence of organised unions, came from Estonian teachers, whose salary cuts were therefore limited.<ref name=presseurop>[http://www.presseurop.eu/en/content/article/478531-most-soviet-western-state PressEurope], 26 January 2011</ref>\n\n[[Estonian euro coins]] entered circulation on 1 January 2011. Estonia was the fifth of ten states that joined the EU in 2004, and the first ex-Soviet republic to join the [[eurozone]]. Of the ten new member states, Estonia was the first to unveil its design. It originally planned to adopt the euro on 1 January 2007; however, it did not formally apply when [[Slovenia]] did, and officially changed its target date to 1 January 2008, and later, to 1 January 2011.<ref>{{cite news| title=Alcohol and tobacco tax to rise in Estonia next year| url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Alcohol+and+tobacco+tax+to+rise+in+Estonia+next+year/1135227499218| newspaper=Helsingin Sanomat| date=25 May 2007| accessdate=1 January 2009| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615201438/http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Alcohol+and+tobacco+tax+to+rise+in+Estonia+next+year/1135227499218| archivedate=15 June 2008| df=dmy-all}}</ref> On 12 May 2010 the [[European Commission]] announced that Estonia had met all criteria to join the eurozone.<ref>{{cite news| title=Estonia ready for euro| url=http://ec.europa.eu/news/economy/100512_1_en.htm| publisher=European Commission| date=12 May 2010| accessdate=12 May 2010}}</ref> On 8 June 2010, the EU finance ministers agreed that Estonia would be able to join the euro on 1 January 2011.<ref>[http://www.actionforex.com/analysis/daily-forex-fundamentals/estonia-to-join-euro-1-january-2011-20100608115064/ Estonia to Join Euro 1 January 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611052826/http://www.actionforex.com/analysis/daily-forex-fundamentals/estonia-to-join-euro-1-january-2011-20100608115064/ |date=11 June 2010 }}</ref> On 13 July 2010, Estonia received the final approval from the ECOFIN to adopt the euro as from 1 January 2011.

This is how [[Gian Pietro Felisatti]], better known as \"DiFelisatti\", one of the most outstanding composers of that era, along with [[Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Fl\u00f3rez]], volunteered to work on the solo project of the young artist of 20 years. The well-known producers and she had a very good relationship, since both writers were responsible for great successes of the band Timbiriche. Added to the above, Rubio was established in Spain to start recordings of what would be his debut album.\n\n[[Miguel Blasco]], Spanish producer of the greatest discographic hits of [[Alejandra Guzm\u00e1n]], [[Yuri (Mexican singer)|Yuri]] and [[Mijares]] would handle all the production of La Chica Dorada, achieving a breakthrough in just four months of work.

''La Chica Dorada'' was released in Mexico and United States on October 20, 1992, the same day that Madonna released her fifth studio album, ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]''. The album was re-released in [[Europe]] in 2001, and the digital edition was released in 2005.\n\nThe promotion began in July 1992, when Rubio conducted a small advertising campaign by several Mexican media outlets, where she presented her new image as \"golden girl\" and promoted the song \"La Chica Dorada\" on some radio stations. \" The singer made several promotional appearances, including talk shows and live performances in the main cities of Mexico. Paulina Rubio made her debut as a solo singer on the legendary Mexican television program [[Siempre en Domingo]], with [[Ra\u00fal Velasco]] on October 18, 1992,<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1612204/ |title=Debut de Paulina Rubio como solista  |work=[[IMDb]] |year=2012|language=english |accessdate=October 12, 2018}}</ref> 3 days before her album was released.

The producer of the album, [[Miguel Blasco]], thought that Paulina should transmit a more sophisticated and sexy image, and that reflected in her debut single. It peaked number three on US [[Hot Latin Songs|Hot Latin Track]]. \"Amor De Mujer\", the second single in Latin America, reached number eight in the US Hot Latin Tracks. Rubio re-released \"Abriendo Las Puertas Al Amor\" in April 1993 in Latin America.

This is how [[Gian Pietro Felisatti]], better known as \"DiFelisatti\", one of the most outstanding composers of that era, along with [[Jos\u00e9 Ram\u00f3n Fl\u00f3rez]], volunteered to work on the solo project of the young artist of 20 years.

''La Chica Dorada'' was released in Mexico and United States on October 20, 1992, the same day that Madonna released her fifth studio album, ''[[Erotica (Madonna album)|Erotica]]''. The album was re-released in [[Europe]] in 2001, and the digital edition was released in 2005.\n\nThe promotion began in July 1992, when Rubio conducted a small advertising campaign by several Mexican media outlets, where she presented her new image as \"golden girl\" and promoted the song \"La Chica Dorada\" on some radio stations. \" The singer made several promotional appearances, including talk shows and live performances in the main cities of Mexico.

It peaked number three on US [[Hot Latin Songs|Hot Latin Track]]. \"Amor De Mujer\", the second single in Latin America, reached number eight in the US Hot Latin Tracks. Rubio re-released \"Abriendo Las Puertas Al Amor\" in April 1993 in Latin America.

It was founded in March 2007.\n\n==Launch and Ideas==\n\nThe YBM/AVY was launched officially at a [[Breton Party]] Congress in [[Blain, Loire-Atlantique|Blain]], in March 2007. At the beginning, it was formed of a few members of the party willing to make actions and proposals specific to the youth. At their launch, the [[Young Bretons]] published the \"Young Bretons Manifesto\", in which they denounce what they think are France's failures on the political, economical and cultural fields. They criticized the French attitude towards Europe and the failure of decentralization and public reforms in general, and called out to \"emancipation\" and reunification of Brittany, within a federal Europe.\n\nAs the [[Breton Party]], the YBM/AVY advocates a new approach to Breton issues, by emphasizing the European dimension of their ideas : they reject the idea of identity withdrawal and claim they want to simply exist as the other countries. The lead idea of the Manifesto is the point that in a European framework, which is the movement's reference, [[Brittany]] is a country like any other, and therefore must have the same political rights as [[Estonia]], [[Slovenia]] or [[Ireland]].\n\nIn March 2008, for the city council elections, the [[Young Bretons]] publish a document called \"It\u2019s now we must change things\", which summarizes their proposals on topics specific to youth such as housing or universities. They propose, among other items, to struggle against the building of secondary homes on the seaside, or to create a Breton university system which regroups universities and colleges, all this within the framework of [[Brittany]] as a member of the [[European Union]].\n\n==Main subjects==\n\nBeyond the institutional issues, the YBM/AVY mainly addresses the European, university and environment issues. Thus, they have several times advocated a federal Europe and criticized French policies towards Europe, that are in their opinion not enough in favour of European integration.\nThe movement often takes a stand on university reforms : thus, it denounced the 2007 University Freedom and Responsibility Act which, in their opinion, is a mere transfer of expenses without a real autonomy. Likewise, the YBM/AVY opposes introducing student fees and takes as an example the Welsh universities. It also calls out to the regional council to make up for the state's reduction of expenses as far as help for disabled persons is concerned.\nThe [[Young Bretons]] also organized campaigns to raise the public awareness on issues linked with the seaside, in particular housing. They denounced the bulge of secondary homes and proposed a stronger seaside act, as well as a limitation (by tax) of the numbers of buildings, as well as the creation of protected markets.\n\n==Magazine==\n\nSince the end of 2008, the [[Young Bretons]] have published a webzine called Yaouankiz (Youth) three times a year. It aims at broadcasting their ideas on current issues (economy, social) or on theories ([[Breton nationalism]]). The webzine is published on their website.\n\n==Relations with other organizations==\n\nSince the beginning, the YBM/AVY has had relations with other nationalist movements in Europe, whether from the centre-left or the centre-right. In December 2006, they participated in Bilbao in the international youth days for self-determination, organized by [[Euzko Gaztedi]] (EGI). They have links with YEN (Youth of European Nationalities \u2013 gathering youth associations from national or cultural minorities in Europe), and participated in several of their seminars.\nIn August 2008, the movement organized their first summer days, together with Flemish and Basque representatives, from [[Nieuw-Vlaamse Alliantie]] and [[Euzko Gaztedi|EGI]]. On the occasion of these days is written the \"Lorient Declaration on self-determination\" where they denounce the attitude of some European governments, which, according to the text, slow down the decision process of the citizens on their institutions.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Breton Party]]\n* [[Social-democracy]]\n* [[Liberal democracy]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://jeunes.partibreton.org Official site]\n* {{in lang|en|fr}} {{br}} {{in lang|nl|eu}} [http://www.agencebretagnepresse.com/fetch.php?id=11933 Lorient Declaration on self-determination signed by Ar Vretoned Yaouank/Young Bretons Movement and by youth movements from the Bsque country and Flandersm in five languages]\n* [http://taurillon.org/Le-Parti-Breton-prepare-les Le MJB et la construction europ\u00e9enne - le Taurillon]\n\n{{French political parties}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Young Bretons Movement Ar Vretoned Yaouank}}\n[[Category:Political parties established in 2002]]\n[[Category:Social democratic parties in France]]\n[[Category:Political parties in Brittany]]\n[[Category:Breton nationalist parties]]\n[[Category:2002 establishments in France]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=August 2011}}\n{{Infobox political party\n| name = Young Bretons Movement\n|native_name = {{ubl|Ar Vretoned Yaouank|Mouvement des Jeunes Bretons}}\n|colorcode = #08E8DE\n|logo =\n|foundation = 2007\n|ideology = [[Breton nationalism]],<br>[[Breton people|Breton]] [[separatism]],<br>[[Social democracy]],<br>[[Centrism]],<br>[[Social liberalism]],<br>[[European federalism]],\n|national = ''None''\n|international = ''None''\n|europarl = ''None''\n|colors = [[turquoise]]\n|website = {{URL|http://jeunes.partibreton.org}}\n|footnotes =\n}}\nThe '''Young Bretons Movement''', [[Breton language|Breton]] '''Ar Vretoned Yaouank''', is the youth section of the [[Breton Party]].

There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings by others, but they lacked either the quality, financial backing, stamina or the luck to find the momentum that propelled the cin\u00e9matographe Lumi\u00e8re into a worldwide success.Bro Kuzey\n\nSoon [[film production companies]] and studios were established all over the world. The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry. The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera.\n\nConventions toward a general cinematic language developed over the years with [[film editing|editing]], camera movements and other [[cinematic techniques]] contributing specific roles in the [[narrativity|narrative]] of films.\n\n[[Special effects]] became a feature in movies since the late 1890s, popularized by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]' fantasy films. Many effects were impossible or impractical to perform in theater plays and thus added more magic to the experience of movies.\n\nTechnical improvements added length (reaching 60 minutes for a [[feature film]] in 1906), synchronized sound recording (mainstream since the end of the 1920s), color (mainstream since the 1930s) and 3D (mainstream in theaters [[3D film#The \"golden era\" (1952\u20131954)|in the early 1950s]] and since the 2000s). Sound ended the necessity of interruptions of [[title cards]], revolutionized the narrative possibilities for filmmakers, and became an integral part of moviemaking. \n\nPopular new media, including [[television]] (mainstream since the 1950s), [[home video]] (mainstream since the 1980s) and [[internet]] (mainstream since the 1990s) influenced the distribution and consumption of films. Film production usually responded with content to fit the new media, and with technical innovations (including [[widescreen]] (mainstream since the 1950s), 3D and [[4D film]]) and more spectacular films to keep theatrical screenings attractive.\n\nSystems that were cheaper and more easily handled (including [[8mm film]], [[video]] and [[smartphone camera]]s) allowed for an increasing number of people to create films in varying qualities, for any purpose (including [[home movies]] and [[video art]]). The technical quality usually different from professional movies, but became more or less equal with [[digital video]] and affordable high quality [[digital camera]]s.\n\nImproving over time, digital production methods became more and more popular during the 1990s, resulting in increasingly realistic [[visual effects]] and popular feature-length [[computer animation]]s.\n\nDifferent [[film genre]]s emerged and enjoyed variable degrees of success over time, with huge differences between for instance [[horror film]]s (mainstream since the 1890s), [[newsreel]]s (prevalent in U.S. cinemas between the 1910s and the late 1960s), [[musical film|musical]]s (mainstream since the late 1920s) and [[pornographic film]]s (experiencing a [[Golden Age of Porn|Golden Age]] during the 1970s).\n\n==Precursors==\n{{Main|Precursors of film}}\n[[Film]] as an art form has drawn on several earlier traditions in the fields such as (oral) [[storytelling]], [[literature]], [[theatre]] and [[visual art]]s. Forms of art and entertainment that had already featured moving and/or projected images include:\n* [[Shadowgraphy (performing art)|shadowgraphy]], probably used since prehistoric times\n* [[camera obscura]], a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times\n* [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]], possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China\n* [[magic lantern]], developed in the 1650s, preceded by some incidental and/or inferior [[projector]]s\n* [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] \"[[persistence of vision]]\" animation devices ([[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] since 1832, [[zoetrope]] since 1866, [[flip book]] since 1868)\n\nSome ancient sightings of gods and spirits may have been conjured up by means of (concave) mirrors, camera obscura or unknown projectors. By the 16th century [[necromancy|necromantic]] ceremonies and the conjuring of ghostly apparitions by charlatan \"magicians\" and \"witches\" seemed commonplace.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA15#v=onepage|title=Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife|last=Ruffles|first=Tom|pages=15\u201317|isbn=9780786420056|date=2004-09-27}}</ref> The very first magic lantern shows seem to have continued this tradition with images of death, monsters and other scary figures. Around 1790 this was developed into multi-media ghost shows known as [[phantasmagoria]] that could feature mechanical slides, rear projection, mobile projectors, [[superimposition]], [[dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]], live actors, smoke (sometimes to project images upon), odors, sounds and even electric shocks. While the first magic lantern images seem to have been intended to scare audiences, soon all sorts of subjects appeared and the lantern was not only used for storytelling but also for education. In the 19th century several new and popular magic lantern techniques were developed, including [[dissolving views]] and several types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects (chromatrope, etc.) or that showed for instance falling snow, or the planets and their moons revolving.\n\n==Early period==\n===Before celluloid===\nEarly photographic sequences, known as [[chronophotography]], can be regarded as early motion picture recordings that could not yet be presented as moving pictures. Since 1878, [[Eadward Muybridge]] made hundreds of chronophotographic studies of the motion of animals and humans in real-time, soon followed by other chronophotographers like [[\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey]], [[Georges Demen\u00ff]] and [[Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz]]. Usually chronophotography was regarded as a serious, even scientific, method to study motion and almost exclusively involved humans or animals performing a simple movement in front of the camera. Soon after Muybridge published his first results as [[The Horse in Motion]] cabinet cards, people put the silhouette-like photographic images in zoetropes to watch them in motion. Most sequences could later be animated into very short films with fluent motion (relatively often the footage can be presented as a loop that repeats the motion seamlessly).\n\n===Silent era===\n{{Main|Silent film|Sound film}}\nIt is estimated that 80 to 90 percent of all silent films are lost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lost-films.eu/index/whylf|title=Lost Films|website=www.lost-films.eu|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> According to research by [[Library of Congress]] only 14 percent of the 10,919 silent feature films released by major American studios between 1912 and 1929 is located and preserved in original formats and another 11 percent is known from full-length foreign versions or on formats of lesser image quality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/library-of-congress-75-percent-of-silent-films-lost|title=Library of Congress: 75 percent of silent films lost|date=2015-03-25|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> Movie catalogs, reviews and other documentation can provide some details on lost films, but much of early movie history will forever remain incomplete. Although larger trends and developments may have been properly perceived and documented, many details only came to be of interest much later and can be hard to trace. Indication of many specific \"firsts\" and other details may not have seemed important at the time and thus evidence can only be found in the 10 tot 20 percent of films that have survived (with few titles readily available for study), or \u2014 much less reliable \u2014 indications can be found in contemporary written sources and later accounts.\n\n[[File:Kinetoscope.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Interior view of [[Kinetoscope]] with peephole viewer at top of cabinet.]]\nIn the 1890s, films were seen mostly via temporary storefront spaces and traveling exhibitors or as acts in vaudeville programs. A film could be under a minute long and would usually present a single scene, authentic or staged, of everyday life, a public event, a sporting event or [[slapstick]]. There was little to no cinematic technique, the film was usually black and white and it was without sound.\n\n[[File:Fratelli_Lumiere.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brothers Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re]]\nThe novelty of realistic moving photographs was enough for a motion picture industry to blossom before the end of the century, in countries around the world. \"The Cinema\" was to offer a relatively cheap and simple way of providing entertainment to the masses. Filmmakers could record actors' performances, which then could be shown to audiences around the world. Travelogues would bring the sights of far-flung places, with movement, directly to spectators' hometowns. Movies would become the most popular visual art form of the late Victorian age.<ref>Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin. (2003) ''Film History An Introduction''.

The [[Melbourne Athenaeum]] started to screen movies in 1896. [[Movie theater]]s became popular entertainment venues and social hubs in the early 20th century, much like [[cabaret]]s and other theaters.\n\n[[File:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902) by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]].]]\nUntil 1927, most motion pictures were produced without sound. This era is referred to as the [[Silent film|silent era of film]]. To enhance the viewers' experience, silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians in an orchestra, a theatre organ, and sometimes [[sound effect]]s and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. In most countries, [[intertitle]]s came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film, thus dispensing with narrators, but in Japanese cinema human narration remained popular throughout the silent era. The technical problems were resolved by 1923.\n\n[[Illustrated song]]s were a notable exception to this trend that began in 1894 in [[vaudeville]] houses and persisted as late as the late 1930s in film theaters.<ref name=\"The House of Witmark\">{{Cite book|title=The House of Witmark| last=Witmark| first=Isidore|author2=Goldberg, Isaac| year=1939| page=116| publisher=New York OOO| location=New York| id=ASIN B001DZ8MP6|isbn=0-306-70686-5}}</ref> Live performance or sound recordings were paired with hand-colored glass [[Magic lantern (projector)|slides]] projected through [[stereopticon]]s and similar devices. In this way, song narrative was illustrated through a series of slides whose changes were simultaneous with the narrative development. The main purpose of illustrated songs was to encourage [[sheet music]] sales, and they were highly successful with sales reaching into the millions for a single song. Later, with the birth of film, illustrated songs were used as filler material preceding films and during [[Film reel|reel changes]].<ref name=\"The Sounds of Early Cinema ch. 14\">{{Cite book| last=Abel| first=Richard| chapter=That Most American of Attractions, The Illustrated Song| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wADgG_d-PSAC&pg=PA143| title=The Sounds of Early Cinema| editor1-last=Abel| editor1-first=Richard| editor2-first=Rick| editor2-last=Altman| year=2001| pages=143\u2013153| publisher=Indiana University Press| isbn=0-253-33988-X}}</ref>\n\nThe 1914 ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'' was a non-commercial attempt to combine the motion picture with a combination of slides and synchronize the resulting moving picture with audio. The film included hand-painted slides as well as other previously used techniques. Simultaneously playing the audio while the film was being played with a projector was required. Produced by the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]] (Jehovah's Witnesses), this eight\u2013hour bible drama was being shown in 80 cities every day and almost eight million people in the United States and Canada saw the presentation.<ref>''Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics'' {{ISBN|978-1-438-13020-0}} p. 22</ref>\n\n== Birth of movies ==\nWithin eleven years of motion pictures, the films moved from a novelty show to an established large-scale entertainment industry. Films moved from a single shot, completely made by one person with a few assistants, towards films several minutes long consisting of several shots, which were made by large companies in something like industrial conditions.\n\nBy 1900, the first motion pictures that can be considered \"films\"{{snd}} emerged, and film-makers began to introduce basic editing techniques and film narrative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wichm.home.xs4all.nl/myth.html|title=The genesis of cinematography distinguishes two dates: in 1888 the technology became available and from 1900 onwards film language developed.|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Invention and advancement of the camera ===\n[[Image:Melstud2.gif|thumb|200px|[[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] (left) painting a backdrop in his studio.]]\nEarly movie cameras were fastened to the head of a tripod with only simple levelling devices provided. These cameras were effectively fixed during the course of a shot, and the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle. The [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] shot a scene from the back of a train in 1896.\n\nThe first rotating camera for taking [[panning (camera)|panning shots]] was built by [[Robert W. Paul]] in 1897, on the occasion of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]]. He used his camera to shoot the procession in one shot. His device had the camera mounted on a vertical axis that could be rotated by a [[worm gear]] driven by turning a crank handle, and Paul put it on general sale the next year. Shots taken using such a \"panning\" head were also referred to as 'panoramas' in the film catalogues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalmediamuseumblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/robert-w-paul-cinematograph-camera-30th-birthday-countdown/|title=The cine camera which began the National Cinematography Collection|publisher=National Media Museum|date=2013-05-20}}</ref>\n\n[[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] built one of the first film studios in May 1897. It had a glass roof and three glass walls constructed after the model of large studios for still photography, and it was fitted with thin cotton cloths that could be stretched below the roof to diffuse the direct rays of the sun on sunny days.<ref>Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors'', Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 747\u2013765.</ref> Beginning in 1896, M\u00e9li\u00e8s would go on to produce, direct, and distribute over 500 short films. The majority of these films were short, one-shot films completed in one take. M\u00e9li\u00e8s drew many comparisons between film and the stage, which was apparent in his work. He realized that film afforded him the ability (via his use of time lapse photography) to \"produce visual spectacles not achievable in the theater.<ref name=\"Gazetas, Aristides 2000\">Gazetas, Aristides. ''An Introduction to World Cinema''. Jefferson: McFarland Company, Inc, 2000. Print.</ref>\n\n''[[The Execution of Mary Stuart]]'', produced by the Edison Company for viewing with the [[Kinetoscope]], showed [[Mary Queen of Scots]] being executed in full view of the camera. The effect was achieved by replacing the actor with a dummy for the final shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lomography.com/magazine/lifestyle/2011/11/04/the-magic-of-early-cinema-the-execution-of-mary-stuart-1895|title=The execution of Mary Stuart 1895|access-date=2013-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232353/http://www.lomography.com/magazine/lifestyle/2011/11/04/the-magic-of-early-cinema-the-execution-of-mary-stuart-1895|archive-date=2013-12-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s also utilized this technique in the making of ''Escamotage d'un dame chez Robert-Houdin (The Vanishing Lady)''. The woman is seen to vanish through the use of [[stop motion]] techniques.\n\n[[Image:SantaW1.gif|thumb|left|200px|A scene inset inside a circular vignette showing a \"dream vision\" in ''Santa Claus'' (1899).]]\nThe other basic technique for trick cinematography was the [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] of the film in the camera. This was pioneered by [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] in July 1898 in England. The set was draped in black, and after the main shot, the negative was re-exposed to the overlaid scene. His ''The Corsican Brothers'' was described in the catalogue of the [[Warwick Trading Company]] in 1900: \"By extremely careful photography the ghost appears *quite transparent*. After indicating that he has been killed by a sword-thrust, and appealing for vengeance, he disappears. A 'vision' then appears showing the fatal duel in the snow.\u201d\n\nG.A. Smith also initiated the special effects technique of [[reverse motion]]. He did this by repeating the action a second time, while filming it with an inverted camera, and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/725468/|title=Santa Claus (1898)|publisher=BFI Screenonline}}</ref> The first films made using this device were ''Tipsy, Topsy, Turvy'' and ''The Awkward Sign Painter''. The earliest surviving example of this technique is Smith's ''[[The House That Jack Built (1900 film)|The House That Jack Built]]'', made before September 1900.\n\n[[Cecil Hepworth]] took this technique further, by printing the [[negative (photography)|negative]] of the forwards motion backwards frame by frame, so producing a print in which the original action was exactly reversed. To do this he built a special printer in which the negative running through a projector was projected into the gate of a camera through a special lens giving a same-size image. This arrangement came to be called a \"projection printer\", and eventually an \"[[optical printer]]\".\n\nThe use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900 in the films of [[Robert W. Paul]] and Hepworth. Paul shot scenes from ''On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus'' (1899) with the camera turning very slowly. When the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed. Hepworth used the opposite effect in ''The Indian Chief and the [[Seidlitz powder|Seidlitz Powder]]'' (1901). The Chief's movements are sped up by cranking the camera much faster than 16 frames per second. This gives what we would call a \"[[slow motion]]\" effect.\n\n=== Film editing and continuous narrative ===\nThe first films to consist of more than one shot appeared toward the end of the 19th century. A notable example was the French film of the life of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], ''La vie du Christ (The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ)'',<ref>{{Citation|last=Guy|first=Alice|title=The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ|date=January 1907|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139714/|accessdate=2018-04-25}}</ref> by [[Alice Guy]]. These weren't represented as a continuous film, the separate scenes were interspersed with lantern slides, a lecture, and live choral numbers, to increase the running time of the spectacle to about 90 minutes. Another example of this is the reproductions of scenes from the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish war]], made by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] in 1897. Although each scene was sold separately, they were shown one after the other by the exhibitors. Even M\u00e9li\u00e8s' ''Cendrillon (Cinderella)'' of 1898 contained no action moving from one shot to the next one. To understand what was going on in the film the audience had to know their stories beforehand, or be told them by a presenter.\n\n[[File:Paul3.gif|thumb|center|600px|The two scenes making up ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'']]\nReal film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, is attributed to British film pioneer [[Robert W. Paul]]'s ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'', made in 1898 and one of the first films to feature more than one shot.<ref name=\"BFIso01\">{{cite web |title=Come Along, Do! |first=Michael |last=Brooke |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444430/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}</ref> In the first shot, an elderly couple is outside an [[art exhibition]] having lunch and then follow other people inside through the door. The second shot shows what they do inside. Paul's 'Cinematograph Camera No. 1' of 1895 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking, which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times and thereby to create super-positions and [[multiple exposure]]s. This technique was first used in his 1901 film ''[[Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost]]''.\n\nThe further development of action continuity in multi-shot films continued in 1899 at the [[Brighton]] School in [[England]]. In the latter part of that year, [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]] made ''The Kiss in the Tunnel''. This started with a shot from a \"phantom ride\" at the point at which the train goes into a tunnel, and continued with the action on a set representing the interior of a railway carriage, where a man steals a kiss from a woman, and then cuts back to the phantom ride shot when the train comes out of the tunnel. A month later, the Bamforth company in Yorkshire made a restaged version of this film under the same title, and in this case they filmed shots of a train entering and leaving a tunnel from beside the tracks, which they joined before and after their version of the kiss inside the train compartment.\n\n[[File:Telesc4.gif|thumb|center|600px|The first two shots of ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'' (1900), with the telescope POV simulated by the circular mask.]]\nIn 1900, continuity of action across successive shots was definitively established by George Albert Smith and [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]], who also worked in [[Brighton]]. In that year Smith made ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'', in which the main shot shows street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old man observes this through a telescope. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl's foot shown inside a black circular mask, and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene. Even more remarkable is [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''Attack on a China Mission Station'' (1900). The first shot shows Chinese Boxer rebels at the gate; it then cuts to the missionary family in the garden, where a fight ensues. The wife signals to British sailors from the [[balcony]], who come and rescue them. The film also used the first \"reverse angle\" cut in film history.\n\nG.A Smith pioneered the use of the close-up shot in his 1900 films ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'' and ''[[Grandma's Reading Glass]]''. He further developed the ideas of breaking a scene shot in one place into a series of shots taken from different camera positions over the next couple of years, starting with ''The Little Doctors'' of 1901. In a series of films he produced at this time, he also introduced the use of subjective and objective point-of-view shots, the creation of dream-time and the use of reversing. He summed up his work in ''Mary Jane's Mishap'' of 1903, with repeated cuts in to a close shot of a housemaid fooling around, along with superimpositions and other devices, before abandoning film-making to invent the Kinemacolor system of colour cinematography. His films were the first to establish the basics of coherent narrative and what became known as film language, or \"[[film grammar]]\".<ref name=\"BFIso001\">{{cite web |title=As Seen Through a Telescope |first=Michael |last=Brooke |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444530/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"BF01\">{{cite web|title=As Seen Through a Telescope |first=David |last=Fisher |url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_telescope.htm |work=Brightonfilm.com |accessdate=2011-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322002732/http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_telescope.htm |archivedate=2012-03-22}}</ref>\n\nJames Williamson concentrated on making films taking action from one place shown in one shot to the next shown in another shot in films like ''Stop Thief!'', made in 1901, and many others. He also experimented with the close-up, and made perhaps the most extreme one of all in ''[[The Big Swallow]]'', when his character approaches the camera and appears to swallow it. These two film makers of the Brighton School also pioneered the editing of the film; they tinted their work with color and used trick photography to enhance the narrative. By 1900, their films were extended scenes of up to 5 minutes long.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN0552 \n |title=The Brighton School \n |accessdate=2012-12-17 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113027/http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN0552 \n |archivedate=2013-12-24 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nMost films of this period were what came to be called \"chase films\". These were inspired by [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''[[Stop Thief!]]'' of 1901, which showed a tramp stealing a leg of mutton from a butcher's boy in the first shot, then being chased through the second shot by the butcher's boy and assorted dogs, and finally being caught by the dogs in the third shot. Several British films made in the first half of 1903 extended the chase method of film construction. These included ''An Elopement \u00e0 la Mode'' and ''The Pickpocket: A Chase Through London'', made by Alf Collins for the British branch of the French [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont company]], ''Daring Daylight Burglary'', made by [[Frank Mottershaw]] at the Sheffield Photographic Company, and ''[[Desperate Poaching Affray]]'', made by [[William Haggar]]. Haggar in particular innovated the first extant panning shots; the [[poaching|poachers]] are chased by gamekeepers and police officers and the camera pans along, creating a sense of urgency and speed.<ref name=\"Affray\">{{cite web | url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444205/ | title=Desperate Poaching Affray (1903) | work=[[British Film Institute]] | author= | accessdate=20 February 2011}}</ref> His films were also recognised for their intelligent use of depth of staging and screen edges, while film academic [[No\u00ebl Burch]] praised Haggar's effective use of off-screen space.<ref name=\"BFI\">Hayes, Christian.

Porter]].]]\nOther filmmakers took up all these ideas including the American [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]], who started making films for the Edison Company in 1901. Porter, a projectionist, was hired by Thomas Edison to develop his new projection model known as the [[Vitascope]]. Porter wanted to develop a style of filmmaking that would move away from the one-shot short films into a \"story-telling [narrative]\" style.<ref name=\"Gazetas, Aristides 2000\"/> When he began making longer films in 1902, he put a dissolve between every shot, just as Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s was already doing, and he frequently had the same action repeated across the dissolves. His film, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), had a running time of twelve minutes, with twenty separate shots and ten different indoor and outdoor locations. He used [[cross-cutting]] [[film editing|editing]] method to show simultaneous action in different places. The time continuity in ''The Great Train Robbery'' was actually more confusing than that in the films it was modeled on, but nevertheless it was a greater success than them due to its [[American Old West|Wild West]] violence. ''The Great Train Robbery'' served as one of the vehicles that would launch the film medium into mass popularity.<ref name=\"Gazetas, Aristides 2000\"/>\n\nThe Path\u00e9 company in France also made imitations and variations of Smith and Williamson's films from 1902 onwards using cuts between the shots, which helped to standardize the basics of film construction. An influential French film of the period was M\u00e9li\u00e8s's 14-minute-long ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''.<ref name=Hammond>{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Paul|title=Marvellous M\u00e9li\u00e8s|year=1974|publisher=Gordon Fraser|location=London|isbn=0900406380|page=141}}</ref> It was extremely popular at the time of its release, and is the best-known of the hundreds of films made by M\u00e9li\u00e8s. It was one of the first known [[science fiction film]]s, and used innovative [[animation]] and [[special effects]], including the well-known image of the spaceship landing in the Moon's eye. The sheer volume of Path\u00e9's production led to their filmmakers giving a further precision and polish to the details of film continuity.\n\n=== Animation ===\n{{main|History of animation}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'', the world's first animated feature film, and ''[[Pelud\u00f3polis]]'', the first animated feature film with sound, were produced in cutout animation by Italian-born cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\n\n[[File:Humorous Phases of Funny Faces screenshot.jpg|thumb|upright-1|right|A single frame from the ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' animation, showing the use of [[cutout animation|cut-out]] technique]]\nWhen cinematography was introduced, animation was familiar from various optical toys (in stroboscopic form), magic lantern shows (in mechanical form) and from Emile Reynaud's ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''.

By then there were enough films several minutes long available to fill a programme running for at least half an hour, and which could be changed weekly when the local audience became bored with it. Other exhibitors in the United States quickly followed suit, and within a couple of years there were thousands of these [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]]s in operation. The American experience led to a worldwide boom in the production and exhibition of films from 1906 onwards.\n\nBy 1907 purpose-built cinemas for motion pictures were being opened across the United States, Britain and France. The films were often shown with the accompaniment of music provided by a pianist, though there could be more musicians. There were also a very few larger cinemas in some of the biggest cities. Initially, the majority of films in the programmes were [[Path\u00e9]] films, but this changed fairly quickly as the American companies cranked up production. The programme was made up of just a few films, and the show lasted around 30 minutes. The reel of film, of maximum length {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, which usually contained one individual film, became the standard unit of film production and exhibition in this period. The programme was changed twice or more a week, but went up to five changes of programme a week after a couple of years. In general, cinemas were set up in the established entertainment districts of the cities. In 1907, Path\u00e9 began renting their films to cinemas through film exchanges rather than selling the films outright.\n\n[[File:Battle of Chemulpo Bay edison.ogv|thumb|right|An early film, depicting a re-enactment of the [[Battle of Chemulpo Bay]] (Film produced in 1904 by [[Edison Studios]])|alt=A film of a re-enactment of a naval battle, depicting Russians firing at a Japanese ship with a cannon]]\nBy about 1910, actors began to receive screen credit for their roles, and the way to the creation of film stars was opened. Films were increasingly longer, and began to feature proper plots and development.\n\nThe litigation over patents between all the major American film-making companies led to the formation of a trust to control the American film business, with each company in the trust being allocated production quotas (two reels a week for the biggest ones, one reel a week for the smaller). However, although 6,000 exhibitors signed up to the trust, about 2,000 others did not and began to fund new film producing companies. By 1912 the independents had nearly half of the market and the government defeated the trust by initiating [[Antitrust|anti-trust]] action at the same time.\n\nIn the early 20th century, before [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], the motion picture industry was based in [[America's first motion picture industry|Fort Lee, New Jersey]] across the Hudson River from New York City.<ref>Kannapell, Andrea.

Over the course of the next decade, more than 30 silent film companies established studios in town, including [[Metro Pictures]] (later [[MGM]]), [[Edison Studios]], Majestic Films, King Bee Film Company, [[Vim Comedy Company]], [[Norman Studios]], [[Gaumont Studios]] and the [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]]. Comedic actor and Georgia native [[Oliver Hardy|Oliver \"Babe\" Hardy]] began his motion picture career here in 1914. He starred in over 36 short silent films his first year acting. With the closing of Lubin in early 1915, Oliver moved to New York then New Jersey to find film jobs. Acquiring a job with the Vim Company in early 1915, he returned to [[Jacksonville]] in the spring of 1917 before relocating to Los Angeles in October 1917. The first motion picture made in [[Technicolor]] and the first feature-length color movie produced in the United States, [[The Gulf Between]], was also filmed on location in Jacksonville in 1917.\n\nJacksonville was especially important to the [[African-American art|African American film]] industry. One notable individual in this regard is the European American producer Richard Norman, who created a string of films starring black actors in the vein of [[Oscar Micheaux]] and the [[Lincoln Motion Picture Company]]. In contrast to the degrading parts offered in certain white films such as [[The Birth of a Nation]], Norman and his contemporaries sought to create positive stories featuring African Americans in what he termed \"splendidly assuming different roles.\"\n\nJacksonville's mostly conservative residents, however, objected to the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat [[John W. Martin]] was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city's movie industry. By that time, southern [[California]] was emerging as the major movie production center, thanks in large part to the move of film pioneers like [[William Selig]] and [[D.W. Griffith]] to the area. These factors quickly sealed the demise of Jacksonville as a major film destination.\n\nAnother factor for the industry's move west was that up until 1913, most American film production was still carried out around New York, but due to the monopoly of [[Thomas A. Edison, Inc.]]'s film patents and its litigious attempts to preserve it, many filmmakers moved to Southern California, starting with [[William Nicholas Selig|Selig]] in 1909. The sunshine and scenery was important for the production of Westerns, which came to form a major American film genre with the first cowboy stars, [[Broncho Billy Anderson|G.M. Anderson (\"Broncho Billy\")]] and [[Tom Mix]]. Selig pioneered the use of (fairly) wild animals from a zoo for a series of exotic adventures, with the actors being menaced or saved by the animals. [[Kalem Company]] sent film crews to places in America and abroad to film stories in the actual places they were supposed to have happened. Kalem also pioneered the female action heroine from 1912, with [[Ruth Roland]] playing starring roles in their Westerns.\n\nIn France, Path\u00e9 retained its dominant position, followed still by Gaumont, and then other new companies that appeared to cater to the film boom. A film company with a different approach was Film d'Art. This was set up at the beginning of 1908 to make films of a serious artistic nature. Their declared programme was to make films using only the best dramatists, artists and actors. The first of these was ''[[The Assassination of the Duke of Guise|L'Assassinat du Duc de Guise]]'' (''The Assassination of the Duc de Guise''), a historical subject set in the court of [[Henry III of France|Henri III]]. This film used leading actors from the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]], and had a special accompanying score written by [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]. The other French majors followed suit, and this wave gave rise to the English-language description of films with artistic pretensions aimed at a sophisticated audience as [[art film|\"art films\"]]. By 1910, the French film companies were starting to make films as long as two, or even three reels, though most were still one reel long. This trend was followed in Italy, Denmark, and Sweden.\n\nIn Britain, the [[Cinematograph Act 1909]] was the first [[primary legislation]] to specifically regulate the [[film industry]]. [[Cinematograph|Film exhibitions]] often took place in temporary venues and the use of highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] for film, combined with [[limelight]] illumination, created a significant fire hazard. The Act specified a strict building code which required, amongst other things, that the projector be enclosed within a fire resisting enclosure.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Gardiner | first1 = Juliet | title = The Thirties \u2013 an Intimate History | chapter = Prologue | publisher = Harper Press | year = 2010 | location = London | page = 8 | isbn = 978-0-00-724076-0}}</ref>\n\nRegular newsreels were exhibited from 1910 and soon became a popular way for finding out the news{{snd}} the [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1910\u201313|British Antarctic Expedition]] to the [[South Pole]] was filmed for the newsreels as were the [[suffragette]] demonstrations that were happening at the same time.

In Italy, production was spread over several centres, with Turin being the first and biggest. There, [[Ambrosio Film|Ambrosio]] was the first company in the field in 1905, and remained the largest in the country through this period. Its most substantial rival was [[Cines]] in Rome, which started producing in 1906. The great strength of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian industry]] was historical epics, with large casts and massive scenery. As early as 1911, [[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s two-reel ''La Caduta di Troia ([[The Fall of Troy (film)|The Fall of Troy]])'' made a big impression worldwide, and it was followed by even bigger glasses like ''[[Quo Vadis?]]'' (1912), which ran for 90 minutes, and Pastrone's ''[[Cabiria]]'' of 1914, which ran for two and a half hours.\n\nItalian companies also had a strong line in slapstick comedy, with actors like [[Andr\u00e9 Deed]], known locally as \"Cretinetti\", and elsewhere as \"Foolshead\" and \"Gribouille\", achieving worldwide fame with his almost surrealistic gags.\n\nThe most important film-producing country in Northern Europe up until the First World War was Denmark. The [[Nordisk Film|Nordisk]] company was set up there in 1906 by [[Ole Olsen (filmmaker)|Ole Olsen]], a fairground showman, and after a brief period imitating the successes of French and British filmmakers, in 1907 he produced 67 films, most directed by Viggo Larsen, with sensational subjects like ''Den hvide Slavinde (The White Slave)'', ''Isbj\u00f8rnenjagt (Polar Bear Hunt)'' and ''L\u00f8vejagten (The Lion Hunt)''. By 1910, new smaller Danish companies began joining the business, and besides making more films about the [[White Slavery (prostitution)|white slave trade]], they contributed other new subjects. The most important of these finds was [[Asta Nielsen]] in ''[[The Abyss (1910 film)|Afgrunden]] (The Abyss)'', directed by [[Urban Gad]] for Kosmorama, This combined the circus, sex, jealousy and murder, all put over with great conviction, and pushed the other Danish filmmakers further in this direction. By 1912, the Danish film companies were multiplying rapidly.\n\nThe [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish film industry]] was smaller and slower to get started than the Danish industry. Here, the important man was [[Charles Magnusson]], a newsreel cameraman for the Svenskabiografteatern cinema chain. He started fiction film production for them in 1909, directing a number of the films himself. Production increased in 1912, when the company engaged [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]] and [[Mauritz Stiller]] as directors. They started out by imitating the subjects favoured by the Danish film industry, but by 1913 they were producing their own strikingly original work, which sold very well.\n\nRussia began its film industry in 1908 with Path\u00e9 shooting some fiction subjects there, and then the creation of real Russian film companies by [[Aleksandr Drankov]] and [[Aleksandr Khanzhonkov]]. The Khanzhonkov company quickly became much the largest Russian film company, and remained so until 1918.\n\nIn Germany, [[Oskar Messter]] had been involved in film-making from 1896, but did not make a significant number of films per year until 1910. When the worldwide film boom started, he, and the few other people in the German film business, continued to sell prints of their own films outright, which put them at a disadvantage. It was only when [[Paul Davidson (producer)|Paul Davidson]], the owner of a chain of cinemas, brought Asta Nielsen and Urban Gad to Germany from Denmark in 1911, and set up a production company, Projektions-AG \"Union\" ([[PAGU]]), for them, that a change-over to renting prints began. Messter replied with a series of longer films starring Henny Porten, but although these did well in the German-speaking world, they were not particularly successful internationally, unlike the Asta Nielsen films. Another of the growing German film producers just before World War I was the German branch of the French [[Eclair (company)|\u00c9clair]] company, Deutsche \u00c9clair. This was expropriated by the German government, and turned into DECLA when the war started. But altogether, German producers only had a minor part of the German market in 1914.\n\nOverall, from about 1910, American films had the largest share of the market in all European countries except France, and even in France, the American films had just pushed the local production out of first place on the eve of World War I. So even if the war had not happened, American films may have become dominant worldwide. Although the war made things much worse for European producers, the technical qualities of American films made them increasingly attractive to audiences everywhere.\n\n===Film technique===\n[[File:A.E. Smith filming The Bargain Fiend.gif|thumb|left|[[A.E. Smith]] filming ''The Bargain Fiend'' in the [[Vitagraph Studios]] in 1907. Arc floodlights hang overhead.]]\nNew film techniques that were introduced in this period include the use of artificial lighting, fire effects and [[Low-key lighting]] (i.e. lighting in which most of the frame is dark) for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes.\n\nContinuity of action from shot to shot was also refined, such as in Path\u00e9's ''le Cheval emball\u00e9 (The Runaway Horse)'' (1907) where [[cross cutting|cross-cutting between parallel actions]] is used. [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] also began using cross-cutting in the film ''[[The Fatal Hour (1908 film)|The Fatal Hour]]'', made in July 1908. Another development was the use of the [[point of view shot|Point of View shot]], first used in 1910 in Vitagraph's ''Back to Nature''. Insert shots were also used for artistic purposes; the Italian film ''La mala planta (The Evil Plant)'', directed by [[Mario Caserini]] had an insert shot of a snake slithering over the \"Evil Plant\".\n\nAs films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel. [[Genres]] began to be used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama, but these categories were further subdivided.\n\n[[Intertitles]] containing lines of dialogue began to be used consistently from 1908 onwards, such as in Vitagraph's ''An Auto Heroine; or, The Race for the Vitagraph Cup and How It Was Won''. The dialogue was eventually inserted into the middle of the scene and became commonplace by 1912. The introduction of dialogue titles transformed the nature of film narrative. When dialogue titles came to be always cut into a scene just after a character starts speaking, and then left with a cut to the character just before they finish speaking, then one had something that was effectively the equivalent of a present-day sound film.\n\n==During World War I==\n\n===Industry===\n[[Image:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The visual style of ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' included deliberately distorted forms, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets. It uses [[Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]]]]\nThe years of the [[First World War]] were a complex transitional period for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programmes to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices.\n\nIn the United States, these changes brought destruction to many film companies, the Vitagraph company being an exception. Film production began to shift to [[Los Angeles]] during World War I. The [[Universal Studios|Universal Film Manufacturing Company]] was formed in 1912 as an umbrella company. New entrants included the [[Jesse L. Lasky|Jesse Lasky]] Feature Play Company, and Famous Players, both formed in 1913, and later amalgamated into [[Famous Players-Lasky]]. The biggest success of these years was [[David Wark Griffith]]'s ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915). Griffith followed this up with the even bigger ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), but, due to the high quality of film produced in the US, the market for their films was high.\n\nIn France, film production shut down due to the general [[Mobilization|military mobilization]] of the country at the start of the war. Although film production began again in 1915, it was on a reduced scale, and the biggest companies gradually retired from production. Italian film production held up better, although so called \"diva films\", starring anguished female leads were a commercial failure. In Denmark, the Nordisk company increased its production so much in 1915 and 1916 that it could not sell all its films, which led to a very sharp decline in Danish production, and the end of Denmark's importance on the world film scene.\n\nThe [[Cinema of Germany|German film industry]] was seriously weakened by the war. The most important of the new film producers at the time was [[Joe May]], who made a series of thrillers and [[adventure film]]s through the war years, but [[Ernst Lubitsch]] also came into prominence with a series of very successful comedies and dramas.\n\n===New techniques===\n[[File:Die Austernprinzessin screenshot.gif|thumb|300px|Complex vignette shot in ''[[The Oyster Princess|die Austernprinzessin]] (The Oyster Princess)''.]]\nAt this time, studios were blacked out to allow shooting to be unaffected by changing sunlight. This was replaced with floodlights and spotlights. The widespread adoption of irising-in and out to begin and end scenes caught on in this period. This is the revelation of a film shot in a circular mask, which gradually gets larger until it expands beyond the frame. Other shaped slits were used, including vertical and diagonal apertures.\n\nA new idea taken over from still photography was \"[[soft focus]]\". This began in 1915, with some shots being intentionally thrown out of focus for expressive effect, as in [[Mary Pickford]] starrer ''[[Fanchon the Cricket]]''.\n\nIt was during this period that camera effects intended to convey the subjective feelings of characters in a film really began to be established. These could now be done as Point of View ([[Point-of-view shot|POV]]) shots, as in Sidney Drew's ''The Story of the Glove'' (1915), where a wobbly hand-held shot of a door and its keyhole represents the POV of a drunken man. The use of anamorphic (in the general sense of distorted shape) images first appears in these years with [[Abel Gance]] directed ''[[la Folie du Docteur Tube]] (The Madness of Dr. Tube)''. In this film the effect of a drug administered to a group of people was suggested by shooting the scenes reflected in a [[Curved mirror|distorting mirror]] of the fair-ground type.\n\nSymbolic effects taken over from conventional literary and artistic tradition continued to make some appearances in films during these years. In D. W. Griffith's ''[[The Avenging Conscience]]'' (1914), the title \"The birth of the evil thought\" precedes a series of three shots of the protagonist looking at a spider, and ants eating an insect. Symbolist art and literature from the turn of the century also had a more general effect on a small number of films made in Italy and Russia. The supine acceptance of death resulting from passion and forbidden longings was a major feature of this art, and states of delirium dwelt on at length were important as well.\n\n[[File:Screenshot from Old Wives for New.gif|thumb|600px|Insert shot in ''[[Old Wives for New]]'' ([[Cecil B. DeMille]], 1918)]]\nThe use of [[Insert (filmmaking)|insert shots]], i.e. close-ups of objects other than faces, had already been established by the Brighton school, but were infrequently used before 1914. It is really only with Griffith's ''The Avenging Conscience'' that a new phase in the use of the Insert Shot starts. As well as the symbolic inserts already mentioned, the film also made extensive use of large numbers of Big Close Up shots of clutching hands and tapping feet as a means of emphasizing those parts of the body as indicators of psychological tension.\n\nAtmospheric inserts were developed in Europe in the late 1910s. This kind of shot is one in a scene which neither contains any of the characters in the story, nor is a Point of View shot seen by one of them. An early example is in [[Maurice Tourneur]] directed ''[[The Pride of the Clan]]'' (1917), in which there is a series of shots of waves beating on a rocky shore to demonstrate the harsh lives of the fishing folk. [[Maurice Elvey]]'s ''[[Nelson (1918 film)|Nelson; The Story of England's Immortal Naval Hero]]'' (1919) has a symbolic sequence dissolving from a picture of [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] to a peacock, and then to a battleship.\n\nBy 1914, continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema. One of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another. Cutting to ''different'' angles within a scene also became well-established as a technique for dissecting a scene into shots in American films. If the direction of the shot changes by more than ninety degrees, it is called a reverse-angle cutting. The leading figure in the full development of reverse-angle cutting was [[Ralph Ince]] in his films, such as ''The Right Girl'' and ''His Phantom Sweetheart''\n\nThe use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flash-back]] structures continued to develop in this period, with the usual way of entering and leaving a flash-back being through a dissolve. The Vitagraph company's ''[[The Man That Might Have Been]]'' ([[William J. Humphrey]], 1914), is even more complex, with a series of reveries and flash-backs that contrast the protagonist's real passage through life with what might have been, if his son had not died.\n\nAfter 1914, [[cross cutting]] between parallel actions came to be used{{snd}} more so in American films than in European ones. Cross-cutting was often used to get new effects of contrast, such as the cross-cut sequence in [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Whispering Chorus]]'' (1918), in which a supposedly dead husband is having a liaison with a Chinese prostitute in an opium den, while simultaneously his unknowing wife is being remarried in church.\n\n===Film art===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | width     = 300\n | image1    = \n | caption1  = The New [[Tower of Babel]], Fredersen's headquarters in [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]].\n{{sfn|Bukatman|1997|pp=62-3}}\n}}\nThe general trend in the development of cinema, led from the United States, was towards using the newly developed specifically filmic devices for expression of the narrative content of film stories, and combining this with the standard dramatic structures already in use in commercial theatre. [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] had the highest standing amongst American directors in the industry, because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films. [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Cheat (1915 film)|The Cheat]]'' (1915), brought out the moral dilemmas facing their characters in a more subtle way than Griffith. DeMille was also in closer touch with the reality of contemporary American life. [[Maurice Tourneur]] was also highly ranked for the pictorial beauties of his films, together with the subtlety of his handling of fantasy, while at the same time he was capable of getting greater [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] from his actors at appropriate moments, as in ''[[A Girl's Folly]]'' (1917).\n\n[[Mr. & Mrs. Sidney Drew|Sidney Drew]] was the leader in developing \"polite comedy\", while slapstick was refined by [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] and [[Charlie Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]], who both started with [[Mack Sennett]]'s Keystone company. They reduced the usual frenetic pace of Sennett's films to give the audience a chance to appreciate the subtlety and finesse of their movement, and the cleverness of their gags. By 1917 Chaplin was also introducing more dramatic plot into his films, and mixing the comedy with sentiment.\n\nIn Russia, [[Yevgeni Bauer]] put a slow intensity of acting combined with Symbolist overtones onto film in a unique way.\n\nIn Sweden, [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]] made a series of films that combined the realities of people's lives with their surroundings in a striking manner, while Mauritz Stiller developed sophisticated comedy to a new level.\n\nIn Germany, [[Ernst Lubitsch]] got his inspiration from the stage work of [[Max Reinhardt (director)|Max Reinhardt]], both in bourgeois comedy and in spectacle, and applied this to his films, culminating in his ''[[The Doll (1919 film)|die Puppe]]'' (''The Doll''), ''[[The Oyster Princess|die Austernprinzessin]]'' (''The Oyster Princess'') and ''[[Madame DuBarry (1919 film)|Madame DuBarry]]''.\n\n===Hollywood triumphant===\n[[File:Charlie_Chaplin_with_doll.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Charlie Chaplin]]]]\nAt the start of the [[First World War]], [[Cinema of France|French]] and [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] cinema had been the most globally popular. The war came as a devastating interruption to European film industries. The American industry, or \"Hollywood\", as it was becoming known after [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|its new geographical center in California]], gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries on earth.\n\nBy the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 ''feature'' films annually,<ref name=\"filmsite.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/20sintro.html|title=Film History of the 1920s|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997). The comedies of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], the [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] adventures of [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and the romances of [[Clara Bow]], to cite just a few examples, made these performers' faces well known on every continent. The Western visual norm that would become classical [[continuity editing]] was developed and exported \u2013 although its adoption was slower in some non-Western countries without strong [[realism (arts)|realist]] traditions in art and drama, such as [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]].\n\nThis development was contemporary with the growth of the [[studio system]] and its greatest publicity method, the [[star system (film)|star system]], which characterized American film for decades to come and provided models for other film industries. The studios' efficient, top-down control over all stages of their product enabled a new and ever-growing level of lavish production and technical sophistication. At the same time, the system's commercial regimentation and focus on glamorous [[escapism]] discouraged daring and ambition beyond a certain degree, a prime example being the brief but still legendary directing career of the iconoclastic [[Erich von Stroheim]] in the late teens and the 1920s.\n\n==Sound era==\n{{Main|Sound film}}\n{{See also|1930s in film}}\n[[File:DonJuanPoster2.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]] is the first feature-length film to utilize the Vitaphone sound-on-disc sound system with a synchronized musical score and sound effects, though it has no spoken dialogue.]]\nDuring late 1927, Warners released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film; but this process was actually accomplished first by [[Charles Taze Russell]] in 1914 with the lengthy film ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]''. This drama consisted of picture slides and moving pictures synchronized with [[phonograph]] records of talks and music. The early [[sound-on-disc]] processes such as [[Vitaphone]] were soon superseded by [[sound-on-film]] methods like Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], DeForest [[Phonofilm]], and [[RCA Photophone]]. The trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that \"talking pictures\", or \"talkies\", were the future. A lot of attempts were made before the success of ''The Jazz Singer'', that can be seen in the [[List of film sound systems]].\n\nThe change was remarkably swift. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Total changeover was slightly slower in the rest of the world, principally for economic reasons. Cultural reasons were also a factor in countries like [[Cinema of China|China]] and [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]], where silents co-existed successfully with sound well into the 1930s, indeed producing what would be some of the most revered classics in those countries, like [[Wu Yonggang]]'s ''[[The Goddess (1934 film)|The Goddess]]'' (China, 1934) and [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]'s ''[[I Was Born, But...]]'' (Japan, 1932). But even in Japan, a figure such as the [[benshi]], the live narrator who was a major part of Japanese silent cinema, found his acting career was ending.\n\nSound further tightened the grip of major studios in numerous countries: the vast expense of the transition overwhelmed smaller competitors, while the novelty of sound lured vastly larger audiences for those producers that remained. In the case of the U.S., some historians credit sound with saving the Hollywood studio system in the face of the [[Great Depression]] (Parkinson, 1995). Thus began what is now often called \"The Golden Age of Hollywood\", which refers roughly to the period beginning with the introduction of sound until the late 1940s. The American cinema reached its peak of efficiently manufactured glamour and global appeal during this period. The top actors of the era are now thought of as the classic film stars, such as [[Clark Gable]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Greta Garbo]], and the greatest box office draw of the 1930s, child performer [[Shirley Temple]].\n\n===Creative impact of sound===\n[[File:WIZARD OF OZ ORIGINAL POSTER 1939.jpg|alt=A theatrical release poster for The Wizard of Oz (1939).|thumb|[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]]]\nCreatively, however, the rapid transition was a difficult one, and in some ways, film briefly reverted to the conditions of its earliest days. The late '20s were full of static, stagey talkies as artists in front of and behind the camera struggled with the stringent limitations of the early sound equipment and their own uncertainty as to how to utilize the new medium. Many stage performers, directors and writers were introduced to cinema as producers sought personnel experienced in dialogue-based storytelling. Many major silent filmmakers and actors were unable to adjust and found their careers severely curtailed or even ended.\n\nThis awkward period was fairly short-lived. 1929 was a watershed year: [[William Wellman]] with ''[[Chinatown Nights (1929 film)|Chinatown Nights]]'' and ''[[The Man I Love (1929 film)|The Man I Love]]'', [[Rouben Mamoulian]] with ''[[Applause (1929 film)|Applause]]'', [[Alfred Hitchcock]] with ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (Britain's first sound feature), were among the directors to bring greater fluidity to talkies and experiment with the expressive use of sound (Eyman, 1997). In this, they both benefited from, and pushed further, technical advances in microphones and cameras, and capabilities for editing and post-synchronizing sound (rather than recording all sound directly at the time of filming).\n\n[[Image:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (13).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Walt Disney]] introduces each of the seven dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' theatrical trailer.]]\nSound films emphasized black history and benefited different [[genres]] more so than silents did. Most obviously, the [[musical film]] was born; the first classic-style Hollywood musical was ''[[The Broadway Melody]]'' (1929) and the form would find its first major creator in [[choreographer]]/director [[Busby Berkeley]] (''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'', 1933, ''[[Dames]]'', 1934). In France, [[avant-garde]] director [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] made [[surrealism|surreal]] use of song and dance in comedies like ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris]]'' (1930) and ''[[Le Million]]'' (1931). [[Universal Pictures]] began releasing [[gothic horror]] films like ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931)|Frankenstein]]'' (both 1931). In 1933, [[RKO Pictures]] released [[Merian C. Cooper]]'s classic \"giant monster\" film ''[[King Kong (1933)|King Kong]]''. The trend thrived best in [[Cinema of India|India]], where the influence of the country's traditional song-and-dance drama made the musical the basic form of most sound films (Cook, 1990); virtually unnoticed by the Western world for decades, this Indian popular cinema would nevertheless become the world's most prolific. (''See also [[Bollywood]].'')\n\nAt this time, American [[gangster film]]s like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' and Wellman's ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (both 1931) became popular. Dialogue now took precedence over \"slapstick\" in Hollywood comedies: the fast-paced, witty banter of ''[[The Front Page]]'' (1931) or ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), the sexual double entrendres of [[Mae West]] (''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'', 1933) or the often subversively anarchic nonsense talk of the [[Marx Brothers]] (''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', 1933). [[Walt Disney]], who had previously been in the short cartoon business, stepped into feature films with the first English-speaking animated feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''; released by [[RKO Pictures]] in 1937. 1939, a major year for American cinema, brought such films as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with The Wind]]''.\n\n== Color in cinema ==\nPreviously, it was believed that color films were first projected in 1909 at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London (the main problem with the color being that the technique, created by George Smith, ([[Kinemacolor]]) only used two colors: green and red, which were mixed additively). But in fact, it was in 1901 when the first color film in history was created. This untitled film was directed by photographer [[Edward Raymond Turner]] and his patron [[Fred Lee (cricketer, born 1871)|Frederick Marshall Lee]]. The way they did it was to use black and white film rolls, but have green, red, and blue filters go over the camera individually as it shot. To complete the film, they joined the original footage and filters on a special projector. However, both the shooting of the film and its projection suffered from major unrelated issues that, eventually, sank the idea.\n\nSubsequently, in 1916, the [[technicolor]] technique arrived (trichromatic procedure (green, red, blue). Its use required a triple photographic impression, incorporation of chromatic filters and cameras of enormous dimensions). The first audiovisual piece that was completely realized with this technique was the short of [[Walt Disney]] \"[[Flowers and Trees]]\", directed by [[Burt Gillett]] in 1932. Even so, the first film to be performed with this technique will be \"The Vanities Fair\" (1935) by Rouben Mamoulian. Later on, the technicolor was extended mainly in the musical field as \"[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]\" or \"[[Singin' in the Rain]]\", in films such as \"[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]\" or the animation film, \"[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]\".<ref name=\"esquire1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/es/actualidad/cine/a10335017/primera-pelicula-color/|title=\u00bfCu\u00e1l fue la primera pel\u00edcula en color?|date=2017-08-02|work=Esquire|access-date=2017-12-07|language=es-ES}}</ref>\n\n==World War II and its aftermath==\n{{Main|1940s in film}}\nThe desire for wartime propaganda against the opposition created a renaissance in the film industry in Britain, with realistic war dramas like ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941), ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942), ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944) and [[No\u00ebl Coward]] and [[David Lean]]'s celebrated naval film ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' in 1942, which won a special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]]. These existed alongside more flamboyant films like [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]]'s ''[[The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp]]'' (1943), ''[[A Canterbury Tale]]'' (1944) and ''[[A Matter of Life and Death (film)|A Matter of Life and Death]]'' (1946), as well as [[Laurence Olivier]]'s [[1944 in film|1944 film]] ''[[Henry V (1944 film)|Henry V]]'', based on the [[Shakespearean histories|Shakespearean history]] ''[[Henry V (play)|Henry V]]''. The success of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' allowed Disney to make more animated features like ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941) and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942).\n\nThe onset of US involvement in World War II also brought a proliferation of films as both [[patriotism]] and [[propaganda]]. American propaganda films included ''[[Desperate Journey]]'' (1942), ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]''  (1942), ''[[Forever and a Day (1943 film)|Forever and a Day]]'' (1943) and ''[[Objective, Burma!]]'' (1945). Notable American films from the war years include the anti-Nazi ''[[Watch on the Rhine]]'' (1943), scripted by [[Dashiell Hammett]]; ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), Hitchcock's direction of a script by [[Thornton Wilder]]; the [[George M. Cohan]] [[biopic]], ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), starring [[James Cagney]], and the immensely popular ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Bogart would star in 36 films between 1934 and 1942 including [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), one of the first films now considered a classic [[film noir]]. In 1941, [[RKO Pictures]] released ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' made by [[Orson Welles]]. It is often considered the greatest film of all time. It would set the stage for the modern motion picture, as it revolutionized film story telling.\n\nThe strictures of wartime also brought an interest in more fantastical subjects. These included Britain's [[Gainsborough Pictures|Gainsborough]] melodramas (including ''[[The Man in Grey]]'' and ''[[The Wicked Lady]]''), and films like ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'', ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1943 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', ''I Married a Witch'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (1945 film)|Blithe Spirit]]''. [[Val Lewton]] also produced a series of atmospheric and influential small-budget [[horror film|horror]] films, some of the more famous examples being ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'', ''[[Isle of the Dead (film)|Isle of the Dead]]'' and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]''. The decade probably also saw the so-called \"women's pictures\", such as ''[[Now, Voyager]]'', ''[[Random Harvest (film)|Random Harvest]]'' and ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' at the peak of their popularity.\n\n1946 saw RKO Radio releasing ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' directed by Italian-born filmmaker [[Frank Capra]]. Soldiers returning from the war would provide the inspiration for films like ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'', and many of those in the film industry had served in some capacity during the war. [[Samuel Fuller]]'s experiences in World War II would influence his largely autobiographical films of later decades such as ''[[The Big Red One]]''. [[The Actor's Studio]] was founded in October 1947 by [[Elia Kazan]], [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]], and [[Cheryl Crawford]], and the same year [[Oskar Fischinger]] filmed ''[[Motion Painting No. 1]]''.\n\nIn 1943, ''[[Ossessione]]'' was screened in Italy, marking the beginning of [[Italian neorealism]]. Major films of this type during the 1940s included ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[Rome, Open City]]'', and ''[[La Terra Trema]]''. In 1952 ''[[Umberto D]]'' was released, usually considered the last film of this type.\n\nIn the late 1940s, in Britain, [[Ealing Studios]] embarked on their series of celebrated comedies, including ''[[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Whisky Galore!]]'', ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' and ''[[The Man in the White Suit]]'', and [[Carol Reed]] directed his influential thrillers ''[[Odd Man Out]]'', ''[[The Fallen Idol (film)|The Fallen Idol]]'' and ''[[The Third Man]]''. [[David Lean]] was also rapidly becoming a force in world cinema with ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and his [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] adaptations ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'', and [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]] would experience the best of their creative partnership with films like ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]''.\n\n==1950s==\n{{Main|1950s in film}}\n[[File:Charlton Heston as Antony in Julius Caesar, B&W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|300px|A production scene from the 1950 Hollywood film ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]].]]\nThe [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] investigated Hollywood in the early 1950s. Protested by the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] before the committee, the hearings resulted in the [[blacklist]]ing of many actors, writers and directors, including Chayefsky, [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Dalton Trumbo]], and many of these fled to Europe, especially the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Cold War|Cold War era]] [[zeitgeist]] translated into a type of near-[[paranoia]] manifested in [[theme (literature)|theme]]s such as [[alien invasion|invading armies of evil aliens]], (''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''); and [[communism|communist]] [[fifth column]]ists, (''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'').\n\nDuring the immediate post-war years the cinematic industry was also threatened by television, and the increasing popularity of the medium meant that some film theatres would bankrupt and close. The demise of the \"studio system\" spurred the [[Criticism|self-commentary]] of films like ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1950, the [[Lettrists]] avante-gardists caused riots at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], when [[Isidore Isou]]'s ''Treatise on Slime and Eternity'' was screened. After their criticism of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and split with the movement, the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s continued to cause disruptions when they showed their new [[hypergraphics|hypergraphical]] techniques.\nThe most notorious film is [[Guy Debord]]'s ''Howls for Sade'' of 1952.\n\nDistressed by the increasing number of closed theatres, studios and companies would find new and innovative ways to bring audiences back. These included attempts to widen their appeal with new screen formats. [[Cinemascope]], which would remain a [[20th Century Fox]] distinction until 1967, was announced with 1953's ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''. [[VistaVision]], [[Cinerama]], and [[Todd-AO]] boasted a \"bigger is better\" approach to [[marketing]] films to a dwindling US audience. This resulted in the revival of epic films to take advantage of the new big screen formats. Some of the most successful examples of these [[Bible|Biblical]] and [[history|historical]] spectaculars include ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), ''[[The Vikings (film)|The Vikings]]'' (1958), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) and ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961). Also during this period a number of other significant films were produced in [[Todd-AO]], developed by [[Mike Todd]] shortly before his death, including [[Oklahoma!]] (1955), [[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]] (1956), [[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]] (1958) and [[Cleopatra]] (1963) plus many more.\n\n[[Gimmick]]s also proliferated to lure in audiences. The fad for [[3-D film]] would last for only two years, 1952\u20131954, and helped sell ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' and ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''. Producer [[William Castle]] would tout films featuring \"Emergo\" \"Percepto\", the first of a series of gimmicks that would remain popular marketing tools for Castle and others throughout the 1960s.\n\nIn the U.S., a post-WW2 tendency toward questioning the establishment and societal norms and the early [[activism]] of the [[civil rights movement]] was reflected in Hollywood films such as ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' (1955), ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954), [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' and [[Reginald Rose]]'s ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957). Disney continued making animated films, notably; ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959). He began, however, getting more involved in live action films, producing classics like ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), and ''[[Old Yeller (1957 film)|Old Yeller]]'' (1957). Television began competing seriously with films projected in theatres, but surprisingly it promoted more filmgoing rather than curtailing it.\n\n''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' is probably a unique film in at least one interesting respect. Its two leads, [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Claire Bloom]], were in the industry in no less than three different centuries. In the 19th Century, Chaplin made his theatrical debut at the age of eight, in 1897, in a clog dancing troupe, The Eight Lancaster Lads. In the 21st Century, Bloom is still enjoying a full and productive career, having appeared in dozens of films and television series produced up to and including 2013. She received particular acclaim for her role in ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010).\n\n===Golden age of Asian cinema===\n{{Main|Asian cinema}}\n[[File:Satyajit Ray.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Satyajit Ray]], [[India]]n [[Bengali people|Bengali]] film director.]]\nFollowing the end of World War II in the 1940s, the following decade, the 1950s, marked a 'golden age' for non-English [[world cinema]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Golden Age of the Foreign Film |publisher=[[Film Forum]] |url=http://www.filmforum.org/archivedfilms/golden.html |accessdate=2009-05-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619154125/http://www.filmforum.org/archivedfilms/golden.html |archivedate=19 June 2008 }}</ref><ref name=Daniels>{{cite web|title=Hybrid Cinematics: Rethinking the role of filmmakers of color in American Cinema|author=Tracy K.

Both the quality and quantity of filmmaking had increased rapidly by the end of the 1950s. South Korean films, such as Lee Byeong-il's 1956 comedy ''Sijibganeun nal (The Wedding Day)'', had begun winning international awards. In contrast to the beginning of the 1950s, when only 5 films were made per year, 111 films were produced in South Korea in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|first=Darcy|last=Paquet|title=1945\u20131959|publisher=Korean Film Page|url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm45-59.html|accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref>\n\nThe 1950s was also a 'Golden Age' for [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine cinema]], with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the local film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to earn recognition abroad. The premiere Philippine directors of the era included [[Gerardo de Leon]], [[Gregorio Fern\u00e1ndez (director)|Gregorio Fern\u00e1ndez]], [[Eddie Romero]], [[Lamberto Avellana]], and [[Cirio Santiago]].<ref name=\"curtain\">[http://www.philnews.com/2005/wa.html Is the Curtain Finally Falling on the Philippine Kovie Industry?]. Accessed January 25, 2009.</ref><ref>[http://www.aenet.org/family/filmhistory.htm Aenet: Philippine Film History]. Accessed January 22, 2009.</ref>\n\n==1960s==\n{{Main|1960s in film}}\nDuring the 1960s, the studio system in [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] declined, because many films were now being made on location in other countries, or using studio facilities abroad, such as [[Pinewood Studios|Pinewood]] in the UK and [[Cinecitt\u00e0]] in Rome. \"Hollywood\" films were still largely aimed at family audiences, and it was often the more old-fashioned films that produced the studios' biggest successes. Productions like ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965) were among the biggest money-makers of the decade. The growth in independent producers and production companies, and the increase in the power of individual actors also contributed to the decline of traditional Hollywood studio production.\n\nThere was also an increasing awareness of foreign language cinema in America during this period. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the [[French New Wave]] directors such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] and [[Jean-Luc Godard]] produced films such as ''[[The 400 Blows|Les quatre cents coups]]'', ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' and ''[[Jules et Jim]]'' which broke the rules of Hollywood cinema's [[narrative structure]]. As well, audiences were becoming aware of Italian films like [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' and the stark dramas of Sweden's [[Ingmar Bergman]].\n\nIn Britain, the \"Free Cinema\" of [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[Tony Richardson]] and others lead to a group of realistic and innovative dramas including ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'', ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' and ''[[This Sporting Life]]''. Other British films such as ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'', ''[[Darling (1965 film)|Darling]]'', ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'', ''[[Blowup]]'' and ''[[Georgy Girl]]'' (all in 1965\u20131966) helped to reduce prohibitions of sex and nudity on screen, while the casual sex and violence of the [[James Bond]] films, beginning with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' in 1962 would render the series popular worldwide.\n\nDuring the 1960s, [[Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne]] produced several French- and [[Wolof language|Wolof-language]] films and became the \"father\" of [[African Cinema]]. In Latin America, the dominance of the \"Hollywood\" model was challenged by many film makers. [[Fernando Solanas]] and [[Octavio Getino]] called for a politically engaged [[Third Cinema]] in contrast to Hollywood and the European [[auteur]] cinema.\n\nFurther, the nuclear paranoia of the age, and the threat of an apocalyptic nuclear exchange (like the 1962 close-call with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] during the [[Cuban missile crisis]]) prompted a reaction within the film community as well. Films like [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]] were produced in a Hollywood that was once known for its overt patriotism and wartime propaganda.\n\nIn [[documentary film]] the sixties saw the blossoming of [[Direct Cinema]], an observational style of film making as well as the advent of more overtly partisan films like ''[[In the Year of the Pig]]'' about the [[Vietnam War]] by [[Emile de Antonio]]. By the late 1960s however, Hollywood filmmakers were beginning to create more innovative and groundbreaking films that reflected the social revolution taken over much of the western world such as ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967), ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969), ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' is often considered the beginning of the so-called [[New Hollywood]].\n\nIn Japanese cinema, Academy Award-winning director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), which like his previous films also had a profound influence around the world. The influence of this film is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" trend.\n\n==1970s==\n{{Main|1970s in film}}\nThe [[New Hollywood]] was the period following the decline of the [[studio system]] during the 1950s and 1960s and the end of the [[production code]], (which was replaced in 1968 by the [[MPAA film rating system]]). During the 1970s, filmmakers increasingly depicted explicit sexual content and showed gunfight and battle scenes that included graphic images of bloody deaths{{snd}} a good example of this is [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972).\n\nPost-classical cinema is the changing methods of storytelling of the New Hollywood producers. The new methods of [[drama]] and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired during the classical/Golden Age period: story chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature unsettling \"[[twist ending]]s\", main characters may behave in a morally ambiguous fashion, and the lines between the [[antagonist]] and [[protagonist]] may be blurred. The beginnings of post-classical storytelling may be seen in 1940s and 1950s [[film noir]] films, in films such as ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), and in Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. 1971 marked the release of controversial films like ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' and ''[[Dirty Harry]]''. This sparked heated controversy over the perceived escalation of violence in cinema.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a new group of American filmmakers emerged, such as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Terrence Malick]], and [[Robert Altman]]. This coincided with the increasing popularity of the [[auteur theory]] in film literature and the media, which posited that a film director's films express their personal vision and creative insights. The development of the auteur style of filmmaking helped to give these directors far greater control over their projects than would have been possible in earlier eras. This led to some great critical and commercial successes, like Scorsese's ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', Coppola's ''[[The Godfather]]'' films, [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', Altman's ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'', Allen's ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'', Malick's ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' and ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', and Polish immigrant [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''. It also, however, resulted in some failures, including [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[At Long Last Love]]'' and [[Michael Cimino]]'s hugely expensive Western epic ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which helped to bring about the demise of its backer, [[United Artists]].\n\nThe financial disaster of ''Heaven's Gate'' marked the end of the visionary \"auteur\" directors of the \"New Hollywood\", who had unrestrained creative and financial freedom to develop films. The phenomenal success in the 1970s of [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' originated the concept of the modern \"[[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]\". However, the enormous success of George Lucas' 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' led to much more than just the popularization of blockbuster film-making. The film's revolutionary use of special effects, sound editing and music had led it to become widely regarded as one of the single most important films in the medium's history, as well as the most influential film of the 1970s. Hollywood studios increasingly focused on producing a smaller number of very large budget films with massive marketing and promotional campaigns. This trend had already been foreshadowed by the commercial success of [[disaster film]]s such as ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]''.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, more pornographic theatres, euphemistically called \"adult cinemas\", were established, and the legal production of [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] films began. Porn films such as ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and its star [[Linda Lovelace]] became something of a popular culture phenomenon and resulted in a spate of similar sex films. The porn cinemas finally died out during the 1980s, when the popularization of the home [[VCR]] and pornography videotapes allowed audiences to watch sex films at home. In the early 1970s, English-language audiences became more aware of the new [[West German]] cinema, with [[Werner Herzog]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] and [[Wim Wenders]] among its leading exponents.\n\nIn [[world cinema]], the 1970s saw a dramatic increase in the popularity of [[martial arts film]]s, largely due to its reinvention by [[Bruce Lee]], who departed from the artistic style of traditional [[Chinese martial arts]] films and added a much greater sense of realism to them with his [[Jeet Kune Do]] style. This began with ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971), which was a major success across [[Asian cinema|Asia]]. However, he didn't gain fame in the [[Western world]] until shortly after his death in 1973, when ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' was released. The film went on to become the most successful martial arts film in cinematic history, popularized the martial arts film genre across the world, and cemented Bruce Lee's status as a cultural icon. [[Hong Kong action cinema]], however, was in decline due to a wave of \"[[Bruceploitation]]\" films. This trend eventually came to an end in 1978 with the martial arts [[comedy film]]s, ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]'', directed by [[Yuen Woo-ping]] and starring [[Jackie Chan]], laying the foundations for the rise of Hong Kong action cinema in the 1980s.\n\nWhile the [[musical film]] genre had declined in Hollywood by this time, musical films were quickly gaining popularity in the [[cinema of India]], where the term \"[[Bollywood]]\" was coined for the growing [[Hindi]] film industry in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (now Mumbai) that ended up dominating [[South Asian cinema]], overtaking the more critically acclaimed [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film industry]] in popularity. Hindi filmmakers combined the Hollywood musical formula with the conventions of ancient [[Theatre of India|Indian theatre]] to create a new film genre called \"[[Masala (film genre)|Masala]]\", which dominated Indian cinema throughout the late 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=K. Moti Gokulsing|first=K. Gokulsing, Wimal Dissanayake|publisher=Trentham Books|year=2004|isbn=1-85856-329-1|pages=98\u201399}}</ref> These \"Masala\" films portrayed [[Action film|action]], comedy, [[Drama film|drama]], [[Romance film|romance]] and [[melodrama]] all at once, with \"[[filmi]]\" song and dance routines thrown in. This trend began with films directed by [[Manmohan Desai]] and starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who remains one of the most popular [[film star]]s in South Asia. The most popular Indian film of all time was ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), a \"Masala\" film inspired by a real-life [[Dacoity|dacoit]] as well as Kurosawa's ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and the [[Spaghetti Western]]s.\n\nThe end of the decade saw the first major international marketing of [[Australia]]n cinema, as [[Peter Weir]]'s films ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' and ''[[The Last Wave]]'' and [[Fred Schepisi]]'s ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (film)|The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' gained critical acclaim. In 1979, Australian filmmaker [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]] also garnered international attention for his violent, low-budget action film ''[[Mad Max]]''.\n\n==1980s==\n{{Main|1980s in film}}\nDuring the 1980s, audiences began increasingly watching films on their home [[VCR]]s. In the early part of that decade, the [[film studio]]s tried legal action to ban home ownership of VCRs as a violation of [[copyright]], which proved unsuccessful. Eventually, the sale and rental of films on [[home video]] became a significant \"second venue\" for exhibition of films, and an additional source of revenue for the film industries. [[Direct-to-video]] (niche) markets usually offered lower quality, cheap productions that were not deemed very suitable for the general audiences of television and theatrical releases.\n\nThe [[George Lucas|Lucas]]\u2013[[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] combine would dominate \"Hollywood\" cinema for much of the 1980s, and lead to much imitation. Two follow-ups to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', three to ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', and three ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films helped to make sequels of successful films more of an expectation than ever before. Lucas also launched [[THX|THX Ltd]], a division of [[Lucasfilm]] in 1982,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thx.com/mod/company/milestones.html |title=THX Milestones |accessdate=2006-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109131348/http://www.thx.com/mod/company/milestones.html |archivedate=2006-11-09}}</ref> while Spielberg enjoyed one of the decade's greatest successes in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' the same year. 1982 also saw the release of Disney's ''[[Tron]]'' which was one of the first films from a major studio to use [[computer graphics]] extensively. American independent cinema struggled more during the decade, although [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983) helped to establish him as one of the most critically acclaimed American film makers of the era. Also during 1983 ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' was released, which was very profitable and resulted in even greater fame for its leading actor [[Al Pacino]]. Probably{{weasel inline|date=August 2018}} the most successful film commercially was [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 version of [[Bob Kane]]'s creation, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which broke box-office records. [[Jack Nicholson]]'s portrayal of the demented [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] earned him a total of $60,000,000 after figuring in his percentage of the gross.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nBritish cinema was given a boost during the early 1980s by the arrival of [[David Puttnam]]'s company [[Goldcrest Films]]. The films ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' and ''[[A Room with a View (1986 film)|A Room with a View]]'' appealed to a \"middlebrow\" audience which was increasingly being ignored by the major Hollywood studios. While the films of the 1970s had helped to define modern [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] motion pictures, the way \"Hollywood\" released its films would now change. Films, for the most part, would premiere in a wider number of theatres, although, to this day, some films still premiere using the route of the [[Roadshow theatrical release|limited/roadshow release system]]. Against some expectations, the rise of the multiplex cinema did not allow less mainstream films to be shown, but simply allowed the major blockbusters to be given an even greater number of screenings. However, films that had been overlooked in cinemas were increasingly being given a second chance on home video.\n\n[[File:Cannes_2014_2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ensemble cast of action stars end of the 80's \t\n[[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Jet Li]], [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Randy Couture]], [[Kellan Lutz]], [[Ronda Rousey]], [[Glen Powell]], [[Victor Ortiz]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]]]\nDuring the 1980s, [[Japanese cinema]] experienced a revival, largely due to the success of [[anime]] films. At the beginning of the 1980s, ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (1973) and ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' (1979), both of which were unsuccessful as television series, were remade as films and became hugely successful in Japan. In particular, ''Mobile Suit Gundam'' sparked the [[Gundam]] franchise of [[Real Robot]] [[mecha]] anime. The success of ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?|Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' also sparked a [[Macross]] franchise of mecha anime. This was also the decade when [[Studio Ghibli]] was founded. The studio produced [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s first [[fantasy film]]s, ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]'' (1984) and ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' (1986), as well as [[Isao Takahata]]'s ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'' (1988), all of which were very successful in Japan and received worldwide critical acclaim. [[Original video animation]] (OVA) films also began during this decade; the most influential of these early OVA films was [[Noboru Ishiguro]]'s [[cyberpunk]] film ''[[Megazone 23]]'' (1985). The most famous anime film of this decade was [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s cyberpunk film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (1988), which although initially unsuccessful at Japanese theaters, went on to become an international success.\n\n[[Hong Kong action cinema]], which was in a state of decline due to endless [[Bruceploitation]] films after the death of [[Bruce Lee]], also experienced a revival in the 1980s, largely due to the reinvention of the [[action film]] genre by [[Jackie Chan]]. He had previously combined the [[comedy film]] and [[martial arts film]] genres successfully in the 1978 films ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]''. The next step he took was in combining this comedy martial arts genre with a new emphasis on elaborate and highly dangerous [[stunt]]s, reminiscent of the [[silent film]] era. The first film in this new style of action cinema was ''[[Project A]]'' (1983), which saw the formation of the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]] as well as the \"Three Brothers\" (Chan, [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]]). The film added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and [[slapstick]] humor, and became a huge success throughout the [[Far East]]. As a result, Chan continued this trend with martial arts action films containing even more elaborate and dangerous stunts, including ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' (1984), ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' (1985), ''[[Armour of God (film)|Armour of God]]'' (1986), ''[[Project A Part II]]'' (1987), ''[[Police Story 2]]'' (1988), and ''[[Dragons Forever]]'' (1988). Other new trends which began in the 1980s were the \"[[girls with guns]]\" subgenre, for which [[Michelle Yeoh]] gained fame; and especially the \"[[heroic bloodshed]]\" genre, revolving around [[Triad (underground societies)|Triads]], largely pioneered by [[John Woo]] and for which [[Chow Yun-fat]] became famous. These Hong Kong action trends were later adopted by many Hollywood action films in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\n==1990s==\n{{Main|1990s in film}}\nThe early 1990s saw the development of a commercially successful independent cinema in the United States. Although cinema was increasingly dominated by special-effects films such as ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), the latter of which became the highest-grossing film of all time at the time up until ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), also directed by James Cameron, independent films like [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989) and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992) had significant commercial success both at the cinema and on home video. Filmmakers associated with the Danish film movement [[Dogme 95]] introduced a manifesto aimed to purify filmmaking. Its first few films gained worldwide critical acclaim, after which the movement slowly faded out.\n\n[[File:1995cinema admissions.png|thumb|250px|right|Cinema admissions in 1995]]\nMajor American studios began to create their own [[independent film|\"independent\" production companies]] to finance and produce non-mainstream fare. One of the most successful independents of the 1990s, [[Miramax Films]], was bought by Disney the year before the release of Tarantino's runaway hit ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' in 1994. The same year marked the beginning of film and video distribution online. Animated films aimed at family audiences also regained their popularity, with Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994). During 1995, the first feature-length [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] feature, ''[[Toy Story]]'', was produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and released by Disney. After the success of Toy Story, computer animation would grow to become the dominant technique for feature-length animation, which would allow competing film companies such as [[DreamWorks Animation]] and [[20th Century Fox]] to effectively compete with Disney with successful films of their own. During the late 1990s, another cinematic transition began, from physical film stock to [[digital cinema]] technology. Meanwhile, [[DVD]]s became the new standard for consumer video, replacing VHS tapes.\n\n==2000s==\n{{Main|2000s in film}}\nSince the late 2000s [[streaming media]] platforms like [[YouTube]] provided means for anyone with access to internet and cameras (a standard feature of [[smartphones]]) to publish videos to the world. Also competing with the increasing popularity of [[video games]] and other forms of [[Home entertainment (disambiguation)|home entertainment]], the industry once again started to make theatrical releases more attractive, with new 3D technologies and epic (fantasy and superhero) films becoming a mainstay in cinemas.\n\nThe [[documentary film]] also rose as a commercial genre for perhaps the first time, with the success of films such as ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''. A new genre was created with [[Martin Kunert]] and [[Eric Manes]]' ''[[Voices of Iraq]]'', when 150 inexpensive DV cameras were distributed across Iraq, transforming ordinary people into collaborative filmmakers. The success of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' led to a revival of interest in [[epic film|epic cinema]], and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' renewed interest in [[musical film|musical cinema]]. [[home cinema|Home theatre]] systems became increasingly sophisticated, as did some of the special edition [[DVD]]s designed to be shown on them. ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings trilogy]]'' was released on DVD in both the theatrical version and in a special extended version intended only for home cinema audiences.\n\nIn 2001, the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] began, and by its end in 2011, it had become the highest-grossing film franchise of all time until the Marvel Cinematic Universe passed it in 2015.\n\nMore films were also being released simultaneously to [[IMAX]] cinema, the first was in 2002's Disney animation ''[[Treasure Planet]]''; and the first live action was in 2003's ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' and a re-release of ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. Later in the decade, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' was the first major feature film to have been at least partially shot in IMAX technology.\n\nThere has been an increasing globalization of cinema during this decade, with foreign-language films gaining popularity in English-speaking markets. Examples of such films include ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (Mandarin), ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (French), ''[[Lagaan]]'' (Hindi), ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japanese), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (Brazilian Portuguese), ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (Aramaic), ''[[Apocalypto]]'' (Mayan) and ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (multiple European languages). Italy is the most awarded country at the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], with 14 awards won, 3 Special Awards and 31 [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|nominations]].\n\nIn 2003, there was a revival in 3D film popularity the first being James Cameron's ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' which was released as the first full-length 3-D IMAX feature filmed with the [[Reality Camera System]]. This camera system used the latest HD video cameras, not film, and was built for Cameron by Emmy nominated Director of Photography Vince Pace, to his specifications. The same camera system was used to film ''[[Spy Kids 3D: Game Over]]'' (2003), ''[[Aliens of the Deep]]'' IMAX (2005), and ''[[The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D]]'' (2005).\n\nAfter James Cameron's 3D film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' became the highest-grossing film of all time, 3D films gained brief popularity with many other films being released in 3D, with the best critical and financial successes being in the field of feature film animation such as [[Universal Pictures]]/[[Illumination Entertainment]]'s ''[[Despicable Me]]'' and [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s ''[[How To Train Your Dragon (film)|How To Train Your Dragon]]'', ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' and ''[[Megamind]]''. ''Avatar'' is also note-worthy for pioneering highly sophisticated use of motion capture technology and influencing several other films such as ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref>https://variety.com/2018/film/news/3d-box-office-1202743603/</ref>\n\n==2010s==\n{{Main|2010s in film}}\n\n{{as of|2011}}, the largest film industries by number of feature films produced were those of India, the United States, China, Nigeria and Japan.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2044888,00.html| title=As Its Box Office Booms, Chinese Cinema Makes a 3-D Push | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Brenhouse, Hillary|date=2011-01-31| accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref>\n\nIn Hollywood, [[superhero film]]s have greatly increased in popularity and financial success, with films based on [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC comics]] regularly being released every year up to the present.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Helmore|first1=Edward|title=They're here to save the world: but how many superhero movies can we take?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/01/superhero-movies-black-panther-captain-marvel|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=1 November 2014}}</ref> {{as of|2019|}}, the superhero genre has been the most dominant genre as far as [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|American box office receipts]] are concerned.

There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings by others, but they lacked either the quality, financial backing, stamina or the luck to find the momentum that propelled the cin\u00e9matographe Lumi\u00e8re into a worldwide success.\n\nSoon [[film production companies]] and studios were established all over the world. The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry. The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera.\n\nConventions toward a general cinematic language developed over the years with [[film editing|editing]], camera movements and other [[cinematic techniques]] contributing specific roles in the [[narrativity|narrative]] of films.\n\n[[Special effects]] became a feature in movies since the late 1890s, popularized by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]]' fantasy films. Many effects were impossible or impractical to perform in theater plays and thus added more magic to the experience of movies.\n\nTechnical improvements added length (reaching 60 minutes for a [[feature film]] in 1906), synchronized sound recording (mainstream since the end of the 1920s), color (mainstream since the 1930s) and 3D (mainstream in theaters [[3D film#The \"golden era\" (1952\u20131954)|in the early 1950s]] and since the 2000s). Sound ended the necessity of interruptions of [[title cards]], revolutionized the narrative possibilities for filmmakers, and became an integral part of moviemaking. \n\nPopular new media, including [[television]] (mainstream since the 1950s), [[home video]] (mainstream since the 1980s) and [[internet]] (mainstream since the 1990s) influenced the distribution and consumption of films. Film production usually responded with content to fit the new media, and with technical innovations (including [[widescreen]] (mainstream since the 1950s), 3D and [[4D film]]) and more spectacular films to keep theatrical screenings attractive.\n\nSystems that were cheaper and more easily handled (including [[8mm film]], [[video]] and [[smartphone camera]]s) allowed for an increasing number of people to create films in varying qualities, for any purpose (including [[home movies]] and [[video art]]). The technical quality usually different from professional movies, but became more or less equal with [[digital video]] and affordable high quality [[digital camera]]s.\n\nImproving over time, digital production methods became more and more popular during the 1990s, resulting in increasingly realistic [[visual effects]] and popular feature-length [[computer animation]]s.\n\nDifferent [[film genre]]s emerged and enjoyed variable degrees of success over time, with huge differences between for instance [[horror film]]s (mainstream since the 1890s), [[newsreel]]s (prevalent in U.S. cinemas between the 1910s and the late 1960s), [[musical film|musical]]s (mainstream since the late 1920s) and [[pornographic film]]s (experiencing a [[Golden Age of Porn|Golden Age]] during the 1970s).\n\n==Precursors==\n{{Main|Precursors of film}}\n[[Film]] as an art form has drawn on several earlier traditions in the fields such as (oral) [[storytelling]], [[literature]], [[theatre]] and [[visual art]]s. Forms of art and entertainment that had already featured moving and/or projected images include:\n* [[Shadowgraphy (performing art)|shadowgraphy]], probably used since prehistoric times\n* [[camera obscura]], a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times\n* [[Shadow play|shadow puppetry]], possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China\n* [[magic lantern]], developed in the 1650s, preceded by some incidental and/or inferior [[projector]]s\n* [[stroboscope|stroboscopic]] \"[[persistence of vision]]\" animation devices ([[phenakistiscope|ph\u00e9nakisticope]] since 1832, [[zoetrope]] since 1866, [[flip book]] since 1868)\n\nSome ancient sightings of gods and spirits may have been conjured up by means of (concave) mirrors, camera obscura or unknown projectors. By the 16th century [[necromancy|necromantic]] ceremonies and the conjuring of ghostly apparitions by charlatan \"magicians\" and \"witches\" seemed commonplace.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=BIL2BgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA15#v=onepage|title=Ghost Images: Cinema of the Afterlife|last=Ruffles|first=Tom|pages=15\u201317|isbn=9780786420056|date=2004-09-27}}</ref> The very first magic lantern shows seem to have continued this tradition with images of death, monsters and other scary figures. Around 1790 this was developed into multi-media ghost shows known as [[phantasmagoria]] that could feature mechanical slides, rear projection, mobile projectors, [[superimposition]], [[dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]], live actors, smoke (sometimes to project images upon), odors, sounds and even electric shocks. While the first magic lantern images seem to have been intended to scare audiences, soon all sorts of subjects appeared and the lantern was not only used for storytelling but also for education. In the 19th century several new and popular magic lantern techniques were developed, including [[dissolving views]] and several types of mechanical slides that created dazzling abstract effects (chromatrope, etc.) or that showed for instance falling snow, or the planets and their moons revolving.\n\n==Early period==\n===Before celluloid===\nEarly photographic sequences, known as [[chronophotography]], can be regarded as early motion picture recordings that could not yet be presented as moving pictures. Since 1878, [[Eadward Muybridge]] made hundreds of chronophotographic studies of the motion of animals and humans in real-time, soon followed by other chronophotographers like [[\u00c9tienne-Jules Marey]], [[Georges Demen\u00ff]] and [[Ottomar Ansch\u00fctz]]. Usually chronophotography was regarded as a serious, even scientific, method to study motion and almost exclusively involved humans or animals performing a simple movement in front of the camera. Soon after Muybridge published his first results as [[The Horse in Motion]] cabinet cards, people put the silhouette-like photographic images in zoetropes to watch them in motion. Most sequences could later be animated into very short films with fluent motion (relatively often the footage can be presented as a loop that repeats the motion seamlessly).\n\n===Silent era===\n{{Main|Silent film|Sound film}}\nIt is estimated that 80 to 90 percent of all silent films are lost.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lost-films.eu/index/whylf|title=Lost Films|website=www.lost-films.eu|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> According to research by [[Library of Congress]] only 14 percent of the 10,919 silent feature films released by major American studios between 1912 and 1929 is located and preserved in original formats and another 11 percent is known from full-length foreign versions or on formats of lesser image quality.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/library-of-congress-75-percent-of-silent-films-lost|title=Library of Congress: 75 percent of silent films lost|date=2015-03-25|website=Variety|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-31}}</ref> Movie catalogs, reviews and other documentation can provide some details on lost films, but much of early movie history will forever remain incomplete. Although larger trends and developments may have been properly perceived and documented, many details only came to be of interest much later and can be hard to trace. Indication of many specific \"firsts\" and other details may not have seemed important at the time and thus evidence can only be found in the 10 tot 20 percent of films that have survived (with few titles readily available for study), or \u2014 much less reliable \u2014 indications can be found in contemporary written sources and later accounts.\n\n[[File:Kinetoscope.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Interior view of [[Kinetoscope]] with peephole viewer at top of cabinet.]]\nIn the 1890s, films were seen mostly via temporary storefront spaces and traveling exhibitors or as acts in vaudeville programs. A film could be under a minute long and would usually present a single scene, authentic or staged, of everyday life, a public event, a sporting event or [[slapstick]]. There was little to no cinematic technique, the film was usually black and white and it was without sound.\n\n[[File:Fratelli_Lumiere.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Brothers Auguste and Louis Lumi\u00e8re]]\nThe novelty of realistic moving photographs was enough for a motion picture industry to blossom before the end of the century, in countries around the world. \"The Cinema\" was to offer a relatively cheap and simple way of providing entertainment to the masses. Filmmakers could record actors' performances, which then could be shown to audiences around the world. Travelogues would bring the sights of far-flung places, with movement, directly to spectators' hometowns. Movies would become the most popular visual art form of the late Victorian age.<ref>Bordwell, David and Thompson, Kristin. (2003) ''Film History An Introduction''. New York: McGraw-Hill Company Inc.p.13</ref>\n\nThe [[Berlin Wintergarten theatre|Berlin Wintergarten theater]] hosted an early movie presentation in front of an audience, shown by the [[Max Skladanowsky|Skladanowsky brothers]] in 1895. The [[Melbourne Athenaeum]] started to screen movies in 1896. [[Movie theater]]s became popular entertainment venues and social hubs in the early 20th century, much like [[cabaret]]s and other theaters.\n\n[[File:Le Voyage dans la lune.jpg|thumb|right|A scene from ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]'' (1902) by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]].]]\nUntil 1927, most motion pictures were produced without sound. This era is referred to as the [[Silent film|silent era of film]]. To enhance the viewers' experience, silent films were commonly accompanied by live musicians in an orchestra, a theatre organ, and sometimes [[sound effect]]s and even commentary spoken by the showman or projectionist. In most countries, [[intertitle]]s came to be used to provide dialogue and narration for the film, thus dispensing with narrators, but in Japanese cinema human narration remained popular throughout the silent era. The technical problems were resolved by 1923.\n\n[[Illustrated song]]s were a notable exception to this trend that began in 1894 in [[vaudeville]] houses and persisted as late as the late 1930s in film theaters.<ref name=\"The House of Witmark\">{{Cite book|title=The House of Witmark| last=Witmark| first=Isidore|author2=Goldberg, Isaac| year=1939| page=116| publisher=New York OOO| location=New York| id=ASIN B001DZ8MP6|isbn=0-306-70686-5}}</ref> Live performance or sound recordings were paired with hand-colored glass [[Magic lantern (projector)|slides]] projected through [[stereopticon]]s and similar devices. In this way, song narrative was illustrated through a series of slides whose changes were simultaneous with the narrative development. The main purpose of illustrated songs was to encourage [[sheet music]] sales, and they were highly successful with sales reaching into the millions for a single song. Later, with the birth of film, illustrated songs were used as filler material preceding films and during [[Film reel|reel changes]].<ref name=\"The Sounds of Early Cinema ch. 14\">{{Cite book| last=Abel| first=Richard| chapter=That Most American of Attractions, The Illustrated Song| chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wADgG_d-PSAC&pg=PA143| title=The Sounds of Early Cinema| editor1-last=Abel| editor1-first=Richard| editor2-first=Rick| editor2-last=Altman| year=2001| pages=143\u2013153| publisher=Indiana University Press| isbn=0-253-33988-X}}</ref>\n\nThe 1914 ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]'' was a non-commercial attempt to combine the motion picture with a combination of slides and synchronize the resulting moving picture with audio. The film included hand-painted slides as well as other previously used techniques. Simultaneously playing the audio while the film was being played with a projector was required. Produced by the [[Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania]] (Jehovah's Witnesses), this eight\u2013hour bible drama was being shown in 80 cities every day and almost eight million people in the United States and Canada saw the presentation.<ref>''Encyclopedia of American Religion and Politics'' {{ISBN|978-1-438-13020-0}} p. 22</ref>\n\n== Birth of movies ==\nWithin eleven years of motion pictures, the films moved from a novelty show to an established large-scale entertainment industry. Films moved from a single shot, completely made by one person with a few assistants, towards films several minutes long consisting of several shots, which were made by large companies in something like industrial conditions.\n\nBy 1900, the first motion pictures that can be considered \"films\"{{snd}} emerged, and film-makers began to introduce basic editing techniques and film narrative.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://wichm.home.xs4all.nl/myth.html|title=The genesis of cinematography distinguishes two dates: in 1888 the technology became available and from 1900 onwards film language developed.|accessdate=2012-12-17}}</ref>\n\n=== Invention and advancement of the camera ===\n[[Image:Melstud2.gif|thumb|200px|[[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] (left) painting a backdrop in his studio.]]\nEarly movie cameras were fastened to the head of a tripod with only simple levelling devices provided. These cameras were effectively fixed during the course of a shot, and the first camera movements were the result of mounting a camera on a moving vehicle. The [[Lumi\u00e8re brothers]] shot a scene from the back of a train in 1896.\n\nThe first rotating camera for taking [[panning (camera)|panning shots]] was built by [[Robert W. Paul]] in 1897, on the occasion of [[Queen Victoria]]'s [[Diamond Jubilee]]. He used his camera to shoot the procession in one shot. His device had the camera mounted on a vertical axis that could be rotated by a [[worm gear]] driven by turning a crank handle, and Paul put it on general sale the next year. Shots taken using such a \"panning\" head were also referred to as 'panoramas' in the film catalogues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalmediamuseumblog.wordpress.com/2013/05/20/robert-w-paul-cinematograph-camera-30th-birthday-countdown/|title=The cine camera which began the National Cinematography Collection|publisher=National Media Museum|date=2013-05-20}}</ref>\n\n[[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] built one of the first film studios in May 1897. It had a glass roof and three glass walls constructed after the model of large studios for still photography, and it was fitted with thin cotton cloths that could be stretched below the roof to diffuse the direct rays of the sun on sunny days.<ref>Wakeman, John. ''World Film Directors'', Volume 1. The H. W. Wilson Company. 1987. pp. 747\u2013765.</ref> Beginning in 1896, M\u00e9li\u00e8s would go on to produce, direct, and distribute over 500 short films. The majority of these films were short, one-shot films completed in one take. M\u00e9li\u00e8s drew many comparisons between film and the stage, which was apparent in his work. He realized that film afforded him the ability (via his use of time lapse photography) to \"produce visual spectacles not achievable in the theater.<ref name=\"Gazetas, Aristides 2000\">Gazetas, Aristides. ''An Introduction to World Cinema''. Jefferson: McFarland Company, Inc, 2000. Print.</ref>\n\n''[[The Execution of Mary Stuart]]'', produced by the Edison Company for viewing with the [[Kinetoscope]], showed [[Mary Queen of Scots]] being executed in full view of the camera. The effect was achieved by replacing the actor with a dummy for the final shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lomography.com/magazine/lifestyle/2011/11/04/the-magic-of-early-cinema-the-execution-of-mary-stuart-1895|title=The execution of Mary Stuart 1895|access-date=2013-12-30|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230232353/http://www.lomography.com/magazine/lifestyle/2011/11/04/the-magic-of-early-cinema-the-execution-of-mary-stuart-1895|archive-date=2013-12-30|url-status=dead}}</ref> Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s also utilized this technique in the making of ''Escamotage d'un dame chez Robert-Houdin (The Vanishing Lady)''. The woman is seen to vanish through the use of [[stop motion]] techniques.\n\n[[Image:SantaW1.gif|thumb|left|200px|A scene inset inside a circular vignette showing a \"dream vision\" in ''Santa Claus'' (1899).]]\nThe other basic technique for trick cinematography was the [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] of the film in the camera. This was pioneered by [[George Albert Smith (film pioneer)|George Albert Smith]] in July 1898 in England. The set was draped in black, and after the main shot, the negative was re-exposed to the overlaid scene. His ''The Corsican Brothers'' was described in the catalogue of the [[Warwick Trading Company]] in 1900: \"By extremely careful photography the ghost appears *quite transparent*. After indicating that he has been killed by a sword-thrust, and appealing for vengeance, he disappears. A 'vision' then appears showing the fatal duel in the snow.\u201d\n\nG.A. Smith also initiated the special effects technique of [[reverse motion]]. He did this by repeating the action a second time, while filming it with an inverted camera, and then joining the tail of the second negative to that of the first.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/725468/|title=Santa Claus (1898)|publisher=BFI Screenonline}}</ref> The first films made using this device were ''Tipsy, Topsy, Turvy'' and ''The Awkward Sign Painter''. The earliest surviving example of this technique is Smith's ''[[The House That Jack Built (1900 film)|The House That Jack Built]]'', made before September 1900.\n\n[[Cecil Hepworth]] took this technique further, by printing the [[negative (photography)|negative]] of the forwards motion backwards frame by frame, so producing a print in which the original action was exactly reversed. To do this he built a special printer in which the negative running through a projector was projected into the gate of a camera through a special lens giving a same-size image. This arrangement came to be called a \"projection printer\", and eventually an \"[[optical printer]]\".\n\nThe use of different camera speeds also appeared around 1900 in the films of [[Robert W. Paul]] and Hepworth. Paul shot scenes from ''On a Runaway Motor Car through Piccadilly Circus'' (1899) with the camera turning very slowly. When the film was projected at the usual 16 frames per second, the scenery appeared to be passing at great speed. Hepworth used the opposite effect in ''The Indian Chief and the [[Seidlitz powder|Seidlitz Powder]]'' (1901). The Chief's movements are sped up by cranking the camera much faster than 16 frames per second. This gives what we would call a \"[[slow motion]]\" effect.\n\n=== Film editing and continuous narrative ===\nThe first films to consist of more than one shot appeared toward the end of the 19th century. A notable example was the French film of the life of [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]], ''La vie du Christ (The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ)'',<ref>{{Citation|last=Guy|first=Alice|title=The Birth, the Life and the Death of Christ|date=January 1907|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0139714/|accessdate=2018-04-25}}</ref> by [[Alice Guy]]. These weren't represented as a continuous film, the separate scenes were interspersed with lantern slides, a lecture, and live choral numbers, to increase the running time of the spectacle to about 90 minutes. Another example of this is the reproductions of scenes from the [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|Greco-Turkish war]], made by [[Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s]] in 1897. Although each scene was sold separately, they were shown one after the other by the exhibitors. Even M\u00e9li\u00e8s' ''Cendrillon (Cinderella)'' of 1898 contained no action moving from one shot to the next one. To understand what was going on in the film the audience had to know their stories beforehand, or be told them by a presenter.\n\n[[File:Paul3.gif|thumb|center|600px|The two scenes making up ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'']]\nReal film continuity, involving action moving from one sequence into another, is attributed to British film pioneer [[Robert W. Paul]]'s ''[[Come Along, Do!]]'', made in 1898 and one of the first films to feature more than one shot.<ref name=\"BFIso01\">{{cite web |title=Come Along, Do! |first=Michael |last=Brooke |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444430/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}</ref> In the first shot, an elderly couple is outside an [[art exhibition]] having lunch and then follow other people inside through the door. The second shot shows what they do inside. Paul's 'Cinematograph Camera No. 1' of 1895 was the first camera to feature reverse-cranking, which allowed the same film footage to be exposed several times and thereby to create super-positions and [[multiple exposure]]s. This technique was first used in his 1901 film ''[[Scrooge, or, Marley's Ghost]]''.\n\nThe further development of action continuity in multi-shot films continued in 1899 at the [[Brighton]] School in [[England]]. In the latter part of that year, [[George Albert Smith (inventor)|George Albert Smith]] made ''The Kiss in the Tunnel''. This started with a shot from a \"phantom ride\" at the point at which the train goes into a tunnel, and continued with the action on a set representing the interior of a railway carriage, where a man steals a kiss from a woman, and then cuts back to the phantom ride shot when the train comes out of the tunnel. A month later, the Bamforth company in Yorkshire made a restaged version of this film under the same title, and in this case they filmed shots of a train entering and leaving a tunnel from beside the tracks, which they joined before and after their version of the kiss inside the train compartment.\n\n[[File:Telesc4.gif|thumb|center|600px|The first two shots of ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'' (1900), with the telescope POV simulated by the circular mask.]]\nIn 1900, continuity of action across successive shots was definitively established by George Albert Smith and [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]], who also worked in [[Brighton]]. In that year Smith made ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'', in which the main shot shows street scene with a young man tying the shoelace and then caressing the foot of his girlfriend, while an old man observes this through a telescope. There is then a cut to close shot of the hands on the girl's foot shown inside a black circular mask, and then a cut back to the continuation of the original scene. Even more remarkable is [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''Attack on a China Mission Station'' (1900). The first shot shows Chinese Boxer rebels at the gate; it then cuts to the missionary family in the garden, where a fight ensues. The wife signals to British sailors from the [[balcony]], who come and rescue them. The film also used the first \"reverse angle\" cut in film history.\n\nG.A Smith pioneered the use of the close-up shot in his 1900 films ''[[As Seen Through a Telescope]]'' and ''[[Grandma's Reading Glass]]''. He further developed the ideas of breaking a scene shot in one place into a series of shots taken from different camera positions over the next couple of years, starting with ''The Little Doctors'' of 1901. In a series of films he produced at this time, he also introduced the use of subjective and objective point-of-view shots, the creation of dream-time and the use of reversing. He summed up his work in ''Mary Jane's Mishap'' of 1903, with repeated cuts in to a close shot of a housemaid fooling around, along with superimpositions and other devices, before abandoning film-making to invent the Kinemacolor system of colour cinematography. His films were the first to establish the basics of coherent narrative and what became known as film language, or \"[[film grammar]]\".<ref name=\"BFIso001\">{{cite web |title=As Seen Through a Telescope |first=Michael |last=Brooke |url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444530/ |work=BFI Screenonline Database |accessdate=2011-04-24 }}</ref><ref name=\"BF01\">{{cite web|title=As Seen Through a Telescope |first=David |last=Fisher |url=http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_telescope.htm |work=Brightonfilm.com |accessdate=2011-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322002732/http://www.terramedia.co.uk/brighton/brighton_films_telescope.htm |archivedate=2012-03-22}}</ref>\n\nJames Williamson concentrated on making films taking action from one place shown in one shot to the next shown in another shot in films like ''Stop Thief!'', made in 1901, and many others. He also experimented with the close-up, and made perhaps the most extreme one of all in ''[[The Big Swallow]]'', when his character approaches the camera and appears to swallow it. These two film makers of the Brighton School also pioneered the editing of the film; they tinted their work with color and used trick photography to enhance the narrative. By 1900, their films were extended scenes of up to 5 minutes long.<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN0552 \n |title=The Brighton School \n |accessdate=2012-12-17 \n |url-status=dead \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224113027/http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN0552 \n |archivedate=2013-12-24 \n |df= \n}}</ref>\n\nMost films of this period were what came to be called \"chase films\". These were inspired by [[James Williamson (film pioneer)|James Williamson]]'s ''[[Stop Thief!]]'' of 1901, which showed a tramp stealing a leg of mutton from a butcher's boy in the first shot, then being chased through the second shot by the butcher's boy and assorted dogs, and finally being caught by the dogs in the third shot. Several British films made in the first half of 1903 extended the chase method of film construction. These included ''An Elopement \u00e0 la Mode'' and ''The Pickpocket: A Chase Through London'', made by Alf Collins for the British branch of the French [[Gaumont Film Company|Gaumont company]], ''Daring Daylight Burglary'', made by [[Frank Mottershaw]] at the Sheffield Photographic Company, and ''[[Desperate Poaching Affray]]'', made by [[William Haggar]]. Haggar in particular innovated the first extant panning shots; the [[poaching|poachers]] are chased by gamekeepers and police officers and the camera pans along, creating a sense of urgency and speed.<ref name=\"Affray\">{{cite web | url=http://www.screenonline.org.uk/film/id/444205/ | title=Desperate Poaching Affray (1903) | work=[[British Film Institute]] | author= | accessdate=20 February 2011}}</ref> His films were also recognised for their intelligent use of depth of staging and screen edges, while film academic [[No\u00ebl Burch]] praised Haggar's effective use of off-screen space.<ref name=\"BFI\">Hayes, Christian.

Accessed 30 August 2011.</ref> He was also one of the first film makers to purposefully introduce violence for entertainment; in ''Desperate Poaching Affray'' the villains are seen firing guns at their pursuers.\n\n[[Image:The Great Train Robbery 0018.jpg|thumb|left|Still from ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'', produced by [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]].]]\nOther filmmakers took up all these ideas including the American [[Edwin Stanton Porter|Edwin S. Porter]], who started making films for the Edison Company in 1901. Porter, a projectionist, was hired by Thomas Edison to develop his new projection model known as the [[Vitascope]]. Porter wanted to develop a style of filmmaking that would move away from the one-shot short films into a \"story-telling [narrative]\" style.<ref name=\"Gazetas, Aristides 2000\"/> When he began making longer films in 1902, he put a dissolve between every shot, just as Georges M\u00e9li\u00e8s was already doing, and he frequently had the same action repeated across the dissolves. His film, ''[[The Great Train Robbery (1903 film)|The Great Train Robbery]]'' (1903), had a running time of twelve minutes, with twenty separate shots and ten different indoor and outdoor locations. He used [[cross-cutting]] [[film editing|editing]] method to show simultaneous action in different places. The time continuity in ''The Great Train Robbery'' was actually more confusing than that in the films it was modeled on, but nevertheless it was a greater success than them due to its [[American Old West|Wild West]] violence. ''The Great Train Robbery'' served as one of the vehicles that would launch the film medium into mass popularity.<ref name=\"Gazetas, Aristides 2000\"/>\n\nThe Path\u00e9 company in France also made imitations and variations of Smith and Williamson's films from 1902 onwards using cuts between the shots, which helped to standardize the basics of film construction. An influential French film of the period was M\u00e9li\u00e8s's 14-minute-long ''[[A Trip to the Moon]]''.<ref name=Hammond>{{cite book|last=Hammond|first=Paul|title=Marvellous M\u00e9li\u00e8s|year=1974|publisher=Gordon Fraser|location=London|isbn=0900406380|page=141}}</ref> It was extremely popular at the time of its release, and is the best-known of the hundreds of films made by M\u00e9li\u00e8s. It was one of the first known [[science fiction film]]s, and used innovative [[animation]] and [[special effects]], including the well-known image of the spaceship landing in the Moon's eye. The sheer volume of Path\u00e9's production led to their filmmakers giving a further precision and polish to the details of film continuity.\n\n=== Animation ===\n{{main|History of animation}}\n\n[[File:Quirino Cristiani con una figura.jpg|thumb|left|150px|''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'', the world's first animated feature film, and ''[[Pelud\u00f3polis]]'', the first animated feature film with sound, were produced in cutout animation by Italian-born cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]].{{sfn|Bendazzi|1994|p=49}}]]\n\n[[File:Humorous Phases of Funny Faces screenshot.jpg|thumb|upright-1|right|A single frame from the ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' animation, showing the use of [[cutout animation|cut-out]] technique]]\nWhen cinematography was introduced, animation was familiar from various optical toys (in stroboscopic form), magic lantern shows (in mechanical form) and from Emile Reynaud's ''[[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Optique|Pantomimes Lumineuses]]''. It took over a decade before animation started to play a role in cinemas with [[stop motion]] short films like [[Segundo de Chom\u00f3n]]'s ''Le th\u00e9\u00e2tre de Bob'' (1906) and [[J. Stuart Blackton]]'s ''The Haunted Hotel'' (1907) as well as hand-drawn short animation films like Blackton's 1906 film ''[[Humorous Phases of Funny Faces]]'' (with some cut-out animation) and [[\u00c9mile Cohl]]'s ''[[Fantasmagorie (1908 film)|Fantasmagorie]]'' (1908).\n\nThe world's first animated feature film was ''[[El Ap\u00f3stol]]'' (1917), made by Italian-Argentine cartoonist [[Quirino Cristiani]] utilizing cutout animation.{{sfn|Finkielman|2004}}{{sfn|Crafton|1993|p=378}} Cristiani also directed the first animated feature film with sound, ''[[Pelud\u00f3polis]]'', released with a vitaphone sound-on-disc synchronization system soundtrack.

The first feature-length multi-reel film in the world was the 1906 Australian production called ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]''.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://portal.unesco.org/en/ev.php-URL_ID=37899&URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&URL_SECTION=201.html|title=Return of the Kelly Gang|journal= The UNESCO Courier|issn=1993-8616|issue=2007 #5|last=Chichester|first=Jo|publisher=[[UNESCO]]}}</ref>\n\nIt traced the life of the legendary infamous [[outlaw]] and [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] (1855\u20131880) and ran for more than an hour with a reel length of approximately 4,000 feet (1,200 m).<ref name=R&P>Ray Edmondson and Andrew Pike (1982) ''Australia's Lost Films.''

By then there were enough films several minutes long available to fill a programme running for at least half an hour, and which could be changed weekly when the local audience became bored with it. Other exhibitors in the United States quickly followed suit, and within a couple of years there were thousands of these [[Nickelodeon (movie theater)|nickelodeon]]s in operation. The American experience led to a worldwide boom in the production and exhibition of films from 1906 onwards.\n\nBy 1907 purpose-built cinemas for motion pictures were being opened across the United States, Britain and France. The films were often shown with the accompaniment of music provided by a pianist, though there could be more musicians. There were also a very few larger cinemas in some of the biggest cities. Initially, the majority of films in the programmes were [[Path\u00e9]] films, but this changed fairly quickly as the American companies cranked up production. The programme was made up of just a few films, and the show lasted around 30 minutes. The reel of film, of maximum length {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, which usually contained one individual film, became the standard unit of film production and exhibition in this period. The programme was changed twice or more a week, but went up to five changes of programme a week after a couple of years. In general, cinemas were set up in the established entertainment districts of the cities. In 1907, Path\u00e9 began renting their films to cinemas through film exchanges rather than selling the films outright.\n\n[[File:Battle of Chemulpo Bay edison.ogv|thumb|right|An early film, depicting a re-enactment of the [[Battle of Chemulpo Bay]] (Film produced in 1904 by [[Edison Studios]])|alt=A film of a re-enactment of a naval battle, depicting Russians firing at a Japanese ship with a cannon]]\nBy about 1910, actors began to receive screen credit for their roles, and the way to the creation of film stars was opened. Films were increasingly longer, and began to feature proper plots and development.\n\nThe litigation over patents between all the major American film-making companies led to the formation of a trust to control the American film business, with each company in the trust being allocated production quotas (two reels a week for the biggest ones, one reel a week for the smaller). However, although 6,000 exhibitors signed up to the trust, about 2,000 others did not and began to fund new film producing companies. By 1912 the independents had nearly half of the market and the government defeated the trust by initiating [[Antitrust|anti-trust]] action at the same time.\n\nIn the early 20th century, before [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|Hollywood]], the motion picture industry was based in [[America's first motion picture industry|Fort Lee, New Jersey]] across the Hudson River from New York City.<ref>Kannapell, Andrea.

Over the course of the next decade, more than 30 silent film companies established studios in town, including [[Metro Pictures]] (later [[MGM]]), [[Edison Studios]], Majestic Films, King Bee Film Company, [[Vim Comedy Company]], [[Norman Studios]], [[Gaumont Studios]] and the [[Lubin Manufacturing Company]]. Comedic actor and Georgia native [[Oliver Hardy|Oliver \"Babe\" Hardy]] began his motion picture career here in 1914. He starred in over 36 short silent films his first year acting. With the closing of Lubin in early 1915, Oliver moved to New York then New Jersey to find film jobs. Acquiring a job with the Vim Company in early 1915, he returned to [[Jacksonville]] in the spring of 1917 before relocating to Los Angeles in October 1917. The first motion picture made in [[Technicolor]] and the first feature-length color movie produced in the United States, [[The Gulf Between]], was also filmed on location in Jacksonville in 1917.\n\nJacksonville was especially important to the [[African-American art|African American film]] industry. One notable individual in this regard is the European American producer Richard Norman, who created a string of films starring black actors in the vein of [[Oscar Micheaux]] and the [[Lincoln Motion Picture Company]]. In contrast to the degrading parts offered in certain white films such as [[The Birth of a Nation]], Norman and his contemporaries sought to create positive stories featuring African Americans in what he termed \"splendidly assuming different roles.\"\n\nJacksonville's mostly conservative residents, however, objected to the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat [[John W. Martin]] was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city's movie industry. By that time, southern [[California]] was emerging as the major movie production center, thanks in large part to the move of film pioneers like [[William Selig]] and [[D.W. Griffith]] to the area. These factors quickly sealed the demise of Jacksonville as a major film destination.\n\nAnother factor for the industry's move west was that up until 1913, most American film production was still carried out around New York, but due to the monopoly of [[Thomas A. Edison, Inc.]]'s film patents and its litigious attempts to preserve it, many filmmakers moved to Southern California, starting with [[William Nicholas Selig|Selig]] in 1909. The sunshine and scenery was important for the production of Westerns, which came to form a major American film genre with the first cowboy stars, [[Broncho Billy Anderson|G.M. Anderson (\"Broncho Billy\")]] and [[Tom Mix]]. Selig pioneered the use of (fairly) wild animals from a zoo for a series of exotic adventures, with the actors being menaced or saved by the animals. [[Kalem Company]] sent film crews to places in America and abroad to film stories in the actual places they were supposed to have happened. Kalem also pioneered the female action heroine from 1912, with [[Ruth Roland]] playing starring roles in their Westerns.\n\nIn France, Path\u00e9 retained its dominant position, followed still by Gaumont, and then other new companies that appeared to cater to the film boom. A film company with a different approach was Film d'Art. This was set up at the beginning of 1908 to make films of a serious artistic nature. Their declared programme was to make films using only the best dramatists, artists and actors. The first of these was ''[[The Assassination of the Duke of Guise|L'Assassinat du Duc de Guise]]'' (''The Assassination of the Duc de Guise''), a historical subject set in the court of [[Henry III of France|Henri III]]. This film used leading actors from the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]], and had a special accompanying score written by [[Camille Saint-Sa\u00ebns]]. The other French majors followed suit, and this wave gave rise to the English-language description of films with artistic pretensions aimed at a sophisticated audience as [[art film|\"art films\"]]. By 1910, the French film companies were starting to make films as long as two, or even three reels, though most were still one reel long. This trend was followed in Italy, Denmark, and Sweden.\n\nIn Britain, the [[Cinematograph Act 1909]] was the first [[primary legislation]] to specifically regulate the [[film industry]]. [[Cinematograph|Film exhibitions]] often took place in temporary venues and the use of highly flammable [[Nitrocellulose|cellulose nitrate]] for film, combined with [[limelight]] illumination, created a significant fire hazard. The Act specified a strict building code which required, amongst other things, that the projector be enclosed within a fire resisting enclosure.<ref>{{cite book | last1 = Gardiner | first1 = Juliet | title = The Thirties \u2013 an Intimate History | chapter = Prologue | publisher = Harper Press | year = 2010 | location = London | page = 8 | isbn = 978-0-00-724076-0}}</ref>\n\nRegular newsreels were exhibited from 1910 and soon became a popular way for finding out the news{{snd}} the [[British Antarctic Expedition, 1910\u201313|British Antarctic Expedition]] to the [[South Pole]] was filmed for the newsreels as were the [[suffragette]] demonstrations that were happening at the same time.

In Italy, production was spread over several centres, with Turin being the first and biggest. There, [[Ambrosio Film|Ambrosio]] was the first company in the field in 1905, and remained the largest in the country through this period. Its most substantial rival was [[Cines]] in Rome, which started producing in 1906. The great strength of the [[Cinema of Italy|Italian industry]] was historical epics, with large casts and massive scenery. As early as 1911, [[Giovanni Pastrone]]'s two-reel ''La Caduta di Troia ([[The Fall of Troy (film)|The Fall of Troy]])'' made a big impression worldwide, and it was followed by even bigger glasses like ''[[Quo Vadis?]]'' (1912), which ran for 90 minutes, and Pastrone's ''[[Cabiria]]'' of 1914, which ran for two and a half hours.\n\nItalian companies also had a strong line in slapstick comedy, with actors like [[Andr\u00e9 Deed]], known locally as \"Cretinetti\", and elsewhere as \"Foolshead\" and \"Gribouille\", achieving worldwide fame with his almost surrealistic gags.\n\nThe most important film-producing country in Northern Europe up until the First World War was Denmark. The [[Nordisk Film|Nordisk]] company was set up there in 1906 by [[Ole Olsen (filmmaker)|Ole Olsen]], a fairground showman, and after a brief period imitating the successes of French and British filmmakers, in 1907 he produced 67 films, most directed by Viggo Larsen, with sensational subjects like ''Den hvide Slavinde (The White Slave)'', ''Isbj\u00f8rnenjagt (Polar Bear Hunt)'' and ''L\u00f8vejagten (The Lion Hunt)''. By 1910, new smaller Danish companies began joining the business, and besides making more films about the [[White Slavery (prostitution)|white slave trade]], they contributed other new subjects. The most important of these finds was [[Asta Nielsen]] in ''[[The Abyss (1910 film)|Afgrunden]] (The Abyss)'', directed by [[Urban Gad]] for Kosmorama, This combined the circus, sex, jealousy and murder, all put over with great conviction, and pushed the other Danish filmmakers further in this direction. By 1912, the Danish film companies were multiplying rapidly.\n\nThe [[Cinema of Sweden|Swedish film industry]] was smaller and slower to get started than the Danish industry. Here, the important man was [[Charles Magnusson]], a newsreel cameraman for the Svenskabiografteatern cinema chain. He started fiction film production for them in 1909, directing a number of the films himself. Production increased in 1912, when the company engaged [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]] and [[Mauritz Stiller]] as directors. They started out by imitating the subjects favoured by the Danish film industry, but by 1913 they were producing their own strikingly original work, which sold very well.\n\nRussia began its film industry in 1908 with Path\u00e9 shooting some fiction subjects there, and then the creation of real Russian film companies by [[Aleksandr Drankov]] and [[Aleksandr Khanzhonkov]]. The Khanzhonkov company quickly became much the largest Russian film company, and remained so until 1918.\n\nIn Germany, [[Oskar Messter]] had been involved in film-making from 1896, but did not make a significant number of films per year until 1910. When the worldwide film boom started, he, and the few other people in the German film business, continued to sell prints of their own films outright, which put them at a disadvantage. It was only when [[Paul Davidson (producer)|Paul Davidson]], the owner of a chain of cinemas, brought Asta Nielsen and Urban Gad to Germany from Denmark in 1911, and set up a production company, Projektions-AG \"Union\" ([[PAGU]]), for them, that a change-over to renting prints began. Messter replied with a series of longer films starring Henny Porten, but although these did well in the German-speaking world, they were not particularly successful internationally, unlike the Asta Nielsen films. Another of the growing German film producers just before World War I was the German branch of the French [[Eclair (company)|\u00c9clair]] company, Deutsche \u00c9clair. This was expropriated by the German government, and turned into DECLA when the war started. But altogether, German producers only had a minor part of the German market in 1914.\n\nOverall, from about 1910, American films had the largest share of the market in all European countries except France, and even in France, the American films had just pushed the local production out of first place on the eve of World War I. So even if the war had not happened, American films may have become dominant worldwide. Although the war made things much worse for European producers, the technical qualities of American films made them increasingly attractive to audiences everywhere.\n\n===Film technique===\n[[File:A.E. Smith filming The Bargain Fiend.gif|thumb|left|[[A.E. Smith]] filming ''The Bargain Fiend'' in the [[Vitagraph Studios]] in 1907. Arc floodlights hang overhead.]]\nNew film techniques that were introduced in this period include the use of artificial lighting, fire effects and [[Low-key lighting]] (i.e. lighting in which most of the frame is dark) for enhanced atmosphere during sinister scenes.\n\nContinuity of action from shot to shot was also refined, such as in Path\u00e9's ''le Cheval emball\u00e9 (The Runaway Horse)'' (1907) where [[cross cutting|cross-cutting between parallel actions]] is used. [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] also began using cross-cutting in the film ''[[The Fatal Hour (1908 film)|The Fatal Hour]]'', made in July 1908. Another development was the use of the [[point of view shot|Point of View shot]], first used in 1910 in Vitagraph's ''Back to Nature''. Insert shots were also used for artistic purposes; the Italian film ''La mala planta (The Evil Plant)'', directed by [[Mario Caserini]] had an insert shot of a snake slithering over the \"Evil Plant\".\n\nAs films grew longer, specialist writers were employed to simplify more complex stories derived from novels or plays into a form that could be contained on one reel. [[Genres]] began to be used as categories; the main division was into comedy and drama, but these categories were further subdivided.\n\n[[Intertitles]] containing lines of dialogue began to be used consistently from 1908 onwards, such as in Vitagraph's ''An Auto Heroine; or, The Race for the Vitagraph Cup and How It Was Won''. The dialogue was eventually inserted into the middle of the scene and became commonplace by 1912. The introduction of dialogue titles transformed the nature of film narrative. When dialogue titles came to be always cut into a scene just after a character starts speaking, and then left with a cut to the character just before they finish speaking, then one had something that was effectively the equivalent of a present-day sound film.\n\n==During World War I==\n\n===Industry===\n[[Image:CABINET DES DR CALIGARI 01.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The visual style of ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' included deliberately distorted forms, and shadows and streaks of light painted directly onto the sets. It uses [[Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne]]]]\nThe years of the [[First World War]] were a complex transitional period for the film industry. The exhibition of films changed from short one-reel programmes to feature films. Exhibition venues became larger and began charging higher prices.\n\nIn the United States, these changes brought destruction to many film companies, the Vitagraph company being an exception. Film production began to shift to [[Los Angeles]] during World War I. The [[Universal Studios|Universal Film Manufacturing Company]] was formed in 1912 as an umbrella company. New entrants included the [[Jesse L. Lasky|Jesse Lasky]] Feature Play Company, and Famous Players, both formed in 1913, and later amalgamated into [[Famous Players-Lasky]]. The biggest success of these years was [[David Wark Griffith]]'s ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'' (1915). Griffith followed this up with the even bigger ''[[Intolerance (film)|Intolerance]]'' (1916), but, due to the high quality of film produced in the US, the market for their films was high.\n\nIn France, film production shut down due to the general [[Mobilization|military mobilization]] of the country at the start of the war. Although film production began again in 1915, it was on a reduced scale, and the biggest companies gradually retired from production. Italian film production held up better, although so called \"diva films\", starring anguished female leads were a commercial failure. In Denmark, the Nordisk company increased its production so much in 1915 and 1916 that it could not sell all its films, which led to a very sharp decline in Danish production, and the end of Denmark's importance on the world film scene.\n\nThe [[Cinema of Germany|German film industry]] was seriously weakened by the war. The most important of the new film producers at the time was [[Joe May]], who made a series of thrillers and [[adventure film]]s through the war years, but [[Ernst Lubitsch]] also came into prominence with a series of very successful comedies and dramas.\n\n===New techniques===\n[[File:Die Austernprinzessin screenshot.gif|thumb|300px|Complex vignette shot in ''[[The Oyster Princess|die Austernprinzessin]] (The Oyster Princess)''.]]\nAt this time, studios were blacked out to allow shooting to be unaffected by changing sunlight. This was replaced with floodlights and spotlights. The widespread adoption of irising-in and out to begin and end scenes caught on in this period. This is the revelation of a film shot in a circular mask, which gradually gets larger until it expands beyond the frame. Other shaped slits were used, including vertical and diagonal apertures.\n\nA new idea taken over from still photography was \"[[soft focus]]\". This began in 1915, with some shots being intentionally thrown out of focus for expressive effect, as in [[Mary Pickford]] starrer ''[[Fanchon the Cricket]]''.\n\nIt was during this period that camera effects intended to convey the subjective feelings of characters in a film really began to be established. These could now be done as Point of View ([[Point-of-view shot|POV]]) shots, as in Sidney Drew's ''The Story of the Glove'' (1915), where a wobbly hand-held shot of a door and its keyhole represents the POV of a drunken man. The use of anamorphic (in the general sense of distorted shape) images first appears in these years with [[Abel Gance]] directed ''[[la Folie du Docteur Tube]] (The Madness of Dr. Tube)''. In this film the effect of a drug administered to a group of people was suggested by shooting the scenes reflected in a [[Curved mirror|distorting mirror]] of the fair-ground type.\n\nSymbolic effects taken over from conventional literary and artistic tradition continued to make some appearances in films during these years. In D. W. Griffith's ''[[The Avenging Conscience]]'' (1914), the title \"The birth of the evil thought\" precedes a series of three shots of the protagonist looking at a spider, and ants eating an insect. Symbolist art and literature from the turn of the century also had a more general effect on a small number of films made in Italy and Russia. The supine acceptance of death resulting from passion and forbidden longings was a major feature of this art, and states of delirium dwelt on at length were important as well.\n\n[[File:Screenshot from Old Wives for New.gif|thumb|600px|Insert shot in ''[[Old Wives for New]]'' ([[Cecil B. DeMille]], 1918)]]\nThe use of [[Insert (filmmaking)|insert shots]], i.e. close-ups of objects other than faces, had already been established by the Brighton school, but were infrequently used before 1914. It is really only with Griffith's ''The Avenging Conscience'' that a new phase in the use of the Insert Shot starts. As well as the symbolic inserts already mentioned, the film also made extensive use of large numbers of Big Close Up shots of clutching hands and tapping feet as a means of emphasizing those parts of the body as indicators of psychological tension.\n\nAtmospheric inserts were developed in Europe in the late 1910s. This kind of shot is one in a scene which neither contains any of the characters in the story, nor is a Point of View shot seen by one of them. An early example is in [[Maurice Tourneur]] directed ''[[The Pride of the Clan]]'' (1917), in which there is a series of shots of waves beating on a rocky shore to demonstrate the harsh lives of the fishing folk. [[Maurice Elvey]]'s ''[[Nelson (1918 film)|Nelson; The Story of England's Immortal Naval Hero]]'' (1919) has a symbolic sequence dissolving from a picture of [[William II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]] to a peacock, and then to a battleship.\n\nBy 1914, continuity cinema was the established mode of commercial cinema. One of the advanced continuity techniques involved an accurate and smooth transition from one shot to another. Cutting to ''different'' angles within a scene also became well-established as a technique for dissecting a scene into shots in American films. If the direction of the shot changes by more than ninety degrees, it is called a reverse-angle cutting. The leading figure in the full development of reverse-angle cutting was [[Ralph Ince]] in his films, such as ''The Right Girl'' and ''His Phantom Sweetheart''\n\nThe use of [[Flashback (narrative)|flash-back]] structures continued to develop in this period, with the usual way of entering and leaving a flash-back being through a dissolve. The Vitagraph company's ''[[The Man That Might Have Been]]'' ([[William J. Humphrey]], 1914), is even more complex, with a series of reveries and flash-backs that contrast the protagonist's real passage through life with what might have been, if his son had not died.\n\nAfter 1914, [[cross cutting]] between parallel actions came to be used{{snd}} more so in American films than in European ones. Cross-cutting was often used to get new effects of contrast, such as the cross-cut sequence in [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Whispering Chorus]]'' (1918), in which a supposedly dead husband is having a liaison with a Chinese prostitute in an opium den, while simultaneously his unknowing wife is being remarried in church.\n\n===Film art===\n{{multiple image\n | align     = right\n | direction = vertical\n | header    =\n | width     = 300\n | image1    = \n | caption1  = The New [[Tower of Babel]], Fredersen's headquarters in [[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]].\n{{sfn|Bukatman|1997|pp=62-3}}\n}}\nThe general trend in the development of cinema, led from the United States, was towards using the newly developed specifically filmic devices for expression of the narrative content of film stories, and combining this with the standard dramatic structures already in use in commercial theatre. [[David Wark Griffith|D. W. Griffith]] had the highest standing amongst American directors in the industry, because of the dramatic excitement he conveyed to the audience through his films. [[Cecil B. DeMille]]'s ''[[The Cheat (1915 film)|The Cheat]]'' (1915), brought out the moral dilemmas facing their characters in a more subtle way than Griffith. DeMille was also in closer touch with the reality of contemporary American life. [[Maurice Tourneur]] was also highly ranked for the pictorial beauties of his films, together with the subtlety of his handling of fantasy, while at the same time he was capable of getting greater [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]] from his actors at appropriate moments, as in ''[[A Girl's Folly]]'' (1917).\n\n[[Mr. & Mrs. Sidney Drew|Sidney Drew]] was the leader in developing \"polite comedy\", while slapstick was refined by [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Fatty Arbuckle]] and [[Charlie Chaplin|Charles Chaplin]], who both started with [[Mack Sennett]]'s Keystone company. They reduced the usual frenetic pace of Sennett's films to give the audience a chance to appreciate the subtlety and finesse of their movement, and the cleverness of their gags. By 1917 Chaplin was also introducing more dramatic plot into his films, and mixing the comedy with sentiment.\n\nIn Russia, [[Yevgeni Bauer]] put a slow intensity of acting combined with Symbolist overtones onto film in a unique way.\n\nIn Sweden, [[Victor Sj\u00f6str\u00f6m]] made a series of films that combined the realities of people's lives with their surroundings in a striking manner, while Mauritz Stiller developed sophisticated comedy to a new level.\n\nIn Germany, [[Ernst Lubitsch]] got his inspiration from the stage work of [[Max Reinhardt (director)|Max Reinhardt]], both in bourgeois comedy and in spectacle, and applied this to his films, culminating in his ''[[The Doll (1919 film)|die Puppe]]'' (''The Doll''), ''[[The Oyster Princess|die Austernprinzessin]]'' (''The Oyster Princess'') and ''[[Madame DuBarry (1919 film)|Madame DuBarry]]''.\n\n===Hollywood triumphant===\n[[File:Charlie_Chaplin_with_doll.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Charlie Chaplin]]]]\nAt the start of the [[First World War]], [[Cinema of France|French]] and [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] cinema had been the most globally popular. The war came as a devastating interruption to European film industries. The American industry, or \"Hollywood\", as it was becoming known after [[Hollywood, Los Angeles|its new geographical center in California]], gained the position it has held, more or less, ever since: film factory for the world and exporting its product to most countries on earth.\n\nBy the 1920s, the United States reached what is still its era of greatest-ever output, producing an average of 800 ''feature'' films annually,<ref name=\"filmsite.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/20sintro.html|title=Film History of the 1920s|accessdate=31 January 2017}}</ref> or 82% of the global total (Eyman, 1997). The comedies of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Buster Keaton]], the [[swashbuckler|swashbuckling]] adventures of [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and the romances of [[Clara Bow]], to cite just a few examples, made these performers' faces well known on every continent. The Western visual norm that would become classical [[continuity editing]] was developed and exported \u2013 although its adoption was slower in some non-Western countries without strong [[realism (arts)|realist]] traditions in art and drama, such as [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]].\n\nThis development was contemporary with the growth of the [[studio system]] and its greatest publicity method, the [[star system (film)|star system]], which characterized American film for decades to come and provided models for other film industries. The studios' efficient, top-down control over all stages of their product enabled a new and ever-growing level of lavish production and technical sophistication. At the same time, the system's commercial regimentation and focus on glamorous [[escapism]] discouraged daring and ambition beyond a certain degree, a prime example being the brief but still legendary directing career of the iconoclastic [[Erich von Stroheim]] in the late teens and the 1920s.\n\n==Sound era==\n{{Main|Sound film}}\n{{See also|1930s in film}}\n[[File:DonJuanPoster2.jpg|left|250px|thumb|[[Don Juan (1926 film)|Don Juan]] is the first feature-length film to utilize the Vitaphone sound-on-disc sound system with a synchronized musical score and sound effects, though it has no spoken dialogue.]]\nDuring late 1927, Warners released ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', which was mostly silent but contained what is generally regarded as the first synchronized dialogue (and singing) in a feature film; but this process was actually accomplished first by [[Charles Taze Russell]] in 1914 with the lengthy film ''[[The Photo-Drama of Creation]]''. This drama consisted of picture slides and moving pictures synchronized with [[phonograph]] records of talks and music. The early [[sound-on-disc]] processes such as [[Vitaphone]] were soon superseded by [[sound-on-film]] methods like Fox [[Movietone sound system|Movietone]], DeForest [[Phonofilm]], and [[RCA Photophone]]. The trend convinced the largely reluctant industrialists that \"talking pictures\", or \"talkies\", were the future. A lot of attempts were made before the success of ''The Jazz Singer'', that can be seen in the [[List of film sound systems]].\n\nThe change was remarkably swift. By the end of 1929, Hollywood was almost all-talkie, with several competing sound systems (soon to be standardized). Total changeover was slightly slower in the rest of the world, principally for economic reasons. Cultural reasons were also a factor in countries like [[Cinema of China|China]] and [[Cinema of Japan|Japan]], where silents co-existed successfully with sound well into the 1930s, indeed producing what would be some of the most revered classics in those countries, like [[Wu Yonggang]]'s ''[[The Goddess (1934 film)|The Goddess]]'' (China, 1934) and [[Yasujir\u014d Ozu]]'s ''[[I Was Born, But...]]'' (Japan, 1932). But even in Japan, a figure such as the [[benshi]], the live narrator who was a major part of Japanese silent cinema, found his acting career was ending.\n\nSound further tightened the grip of major studios in numerous countries: the vast expense of the transition overwhelmed smaller competitors, while the novelty of sound lured vastly larger audiences for those producers that remained. In the case of the U.S., some historians credit sound with saving the Hollywood studio system in the face of the [[Great Depression]] (Parkinson, 1995). Thus began what is now often called \"The Golden Age of Hollywood\", which refers roughly to the period beginning with the introduction of sound until the late 1940s. The American cinema reached its peak of efficiently manufactured glamour and global appeal during this period. The top actors of the era are now thought of as the classic film stars, such as [[Clark Gable]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Humphrey Bogart]], [[Greta Garbo]], and the greatest box office draw of the 1930s, child performer [[Shirley Temple]].\n\n===Creative impact of sound===\n[[File:WIZARD OF OZ ORIGINAL POSTER 1939.jpg|alt=A theatrical release poster for The Wizard of Oz (1939).|thumb|[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]]]\nCreatively, however, the rapid transition was a difficult one, and in some ways, film briefly reverted to the conditions of its earliest days. The late '20s were full of static, stagey talkies as artists in front of and behind the camera struggled with the stringent limitations of the early sound equipment and their own uncertainty as to how to utilize the new medium. Many stage performers, directors and writers were introduced to cinema as producers sought personnel experienced in dialogue-based storytelling. Many major silent filmmakers and actors were unable to adjust and found their careers severely curtailed or even ended.\n\nThis awkward period was fairly short-lived. 1929 was a watershed year: [[William Wellman]] with ''[[Chinatown Nights (1929 film)|Chinatown Nights]]'' and ''[[The Man I Love (1929 film)|The Man I Love]]'', [[Rouben Mamoulian]] with ''[[Applause (1929 film)|Applause]]'', [[Alfred Hitchcock]] with ''[[Blackmail (1929 film)|Blackmail]]'' (Britain's first sound feature), were among the directors to bring greater fluidity to talkies and experiment with the expressive use of sound (Eyman, 1997). In this, they both benefited from, and pushed further, technical advances in microphones and cameras, and capabilities for editing and post-synchronizing sound (rather than recording all sound directly at the time of filming).\n\n[[Image:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (13).jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Walt Disney]] introduces each of the seven dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' theatrical trailer.]]\nSound films emphasized black history and benefited different [[genres]] more so than silents did. Most obviously, the [[musical film]] was born; the first classic-style Hollywood musical was ''[[The Broadway Melody]]'' (1929) and the form would find its first major creator in [[choreographer]]/director [[Busby Berkeley]] (''[[42nd Street (film)|42nd Street]]'', 1933, ''[[Dames]]'', 1934). In France, [[avant-garde]] director [[Ren\u00e9 Clair]] made [[surrealism|surreal]] use of song and dance in comedies like ''[[Under the Roofs of Paris]]'' (1930) and ''[[Le Million]]'' (1931). [[Universal Pictures]] began releasing [[gothic horror]] films like ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' and ''[[Frankenstein (1931)|Frankenstein]]'' (both 1931). In 1933, [[RKO Pictures]] released [[Merian C. Cooper]]'s classic \"giant monster\" film ''[[King Kong (1933)|King Kong]]''. The trend thrived best in [[Cinema of India|India]], where the influence of the country's traditional song-and-dance drama made the musical the basic form of most sound films (Cook, 1990); virtually unnoticed by the Western world for decades, this Indian popular cinema would nevertheless become the world's most prolific. (''See also [[Bollywood]].'')\n\nAt this time, American [[gangster film]]s like ''[[Little Caesar (film)|Little Caesar]]'' and Wellman's ''[[The Public Enemy]]'' (both 1931) became popular. Dialogue now took precedence over \"slapstick\" in Hollywood comedies: the fast-paced, witty banter of ''[[The Front Page]]'' (1931) or ''[[It Happened One Night]]'' (1934), the sexual double entrendres of [[Mae West]] (''[[She Done Him Wrong]]'', 1933) or the often subversively anarchic nonsense talk of the [[Marx Brothers]] (''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', 1933). [[Walt Disney]], who had previously been in the short cartoon business, stepped into feature films with the first English-speaking animated feature ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]''; released by [[RKO Pictures]] in 1937. 1939, a major year for American cinema, brought such films as ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'' and ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with The Wind]]''.\n\n== Color in cinema ==\nPreviously, it was believed that color films were first projected in 1909 at the [[Palace Theatre, London|Palace Theatre]] in London (the main problem with the color being that the technique, created by George Smith, ([[Kinemacolor]]) only used two colors: green and red, which were mixed additively). But in fact, it was in 1901 when the first color film in history was created. This untitled film was directed by photographer [[Edward Raymond Turner]] and his patron [[Fred Lee (cricketer, born 1871)|Frederick Marshall Lee]]. The way they did it was to use black and white film rolls, but have green, red, and blue filters go over the camera individually as it shot. To complete the film, they joined the original footage and filters on a special projector. However, both the shooting of the film and its projection suffered from major unrelated issues that, eventually, sank the idea.\n\nSubsequently, in 1916, the [[technicolor]] technique arrived (trichromatic procedure (green, red, blue). Its use required a triple photographic impression, incorporation of chromatic filters and cameras of enormous dimensions). The first audiovisual piece that was completely realized with this technique was the short of [[Walt Disney]] \"[[Flowers and Trees]]\", directed by [[Burt Gillett]] in 1932. Even so, the first film to be performed with this technique will be \"The Vanities Fair\" (1935) by Rouben Mamoulian. Later on, the technicolor was extended mainly in the musical field as \"[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]\" or \"[[Singin' in the Rain]]\", in films such as \"[[The Adventures of Robin Hood]]\" or the animation film, \"[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]\".<ref name=\"esquire1\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.esquire.com/es/actualidad/cine/a10335017/primera-pelicula-color/|title=\u00bfCu\u00e1l fue la primera pel\u00edcula en color?|date=2017-08-02|work=Esquire|access-date=2017-12-07|language=es-ES}}</ref>\n\n==World War II and its aftermath==\n{{Main|1940s in film}}\nThe desire for wartime propaganda against the opposition created a renaissance in the film industry in Britain, with realistic war dramas like ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941), ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942), ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944) and [[No\u00ebl Coward]] and [[David Lean]]'s celebrated naval film ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' in 1942, which won a special [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]].

The success of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' allowed Disney to make more animated features like ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'' (1940), ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'' (1940), ''[[Dumbo]]'' (1941) and ''[[Bambi]]'' (1942).\n\nThe onset of US involvement in World War II also brought a proliferation of films as both [[patriotism]] and [[propaganda]]. American propaganda films included ''[[Desperate Journey]]'' (1942), ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]''  (1942), ''[[Forever and a Day (1943 film)|Forever and a Day]]'' (1943) and ''[[Objective, Burma!]]'' (1945). Notable American films from the war years include the anti-Nazi ''[[Watch on the Rhine]]'' (1943), scripted by [[Dashiell Hammett]]; ''[[Shadow of a Doubt]]'' (1943), Hitchcock's direction of a script by [[Thornton Wilder]]; the [[George M. Cohan]] [[biopic]], ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), starring [[James Cagney]], and the immensely popular ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'', with [[Humphrey Bogart]]. Bogart would star in 36 films between 1934 and 1942 including [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' (1941), one of the first films now considered a classic [[film noir]]. In 1941, [[RKO Pictures]] released ''[[Citizen Kane]]'' made by [[Orson Welles]]. It is often considered the greatest film of all time. It would set the stage for the modern motion picture, as it revolutionized film story telling.\n\nThe strictures of wartime also brought an interest in more fantastical subjects. These included Britain's [[Gainsborough Pictures|Gainsborough]] melodramas (including ''[[The Man in Grey]]'' and ''[[The Wicked Lady]]''), and films like ''[[Here Comes Mr. Jordan]]'', ''[[Heaven Can Wait (1943 film)|Heaven Can Wait]]'', ''I Married a Witch'' and ''[[Blithe Spirit (1945 film)|Blithe Spirit]]''. [[Val Lewton]] also produced a series of atmospheric and influential small-budget [[horror film|horror]] films, some of the more famous examples being ''[[Cat People (1942 film)|Cat People]]'', ''[[Isle of the Dead (film)|Isle of the Dead]]'' and ''[[The Body Snatcher (film)|The Body Snatcher]]''. The decade probably also saw the so-called \"women's pictures\", such as ''[[Now, Voyager]]'', ''[[Random Harvest (film)|Random Harvest]]'' and ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' at the peak of their popularity.\n\n1946 saw RKO Radio releasing ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' directed by Italian-born filmmaker [[Frank Capra]]. Soldiers returning from the war would provide the inspiration for films like ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'', and many of those in the film industry had served in some capacity during the war. [[Samuel Fuller]]'s experiences in World War II would influence his largely autobiographical films of later decades such as ''[[The Big Red One]]''. [[The Actor's Studio]] was founded in October 1947 by [[Elia Kazan]], [[Robert Lewis (actor)|Robert Lewis]], and [[Cheryl Crawford]], and the same year [[Oskar Fischinger]] filmed ''[[Motion Painting No. 1]]''.\n\nIn 1943, ''[[Ossessione]]'' was screened in Italy, marking the beginning of [[Italian neorealism]]. Major films of this type during the 1940s included ''[[Bicycle Thieves]]'', ''[[Rome, Open City]]'', and ''[[La Terra Trema]]''. In 1952 ''[[Umberto D]]'' was released, usually considered the last film of this type.\n\nIn the late 1940s, in Britain, [[Ealing Studios]] embarked on their series of celebrated comedies, including ''[[Whisky Galore! (1949 film)|Whisky Galore!]]'', ''[[Passport to Pimlico]]'', ''[[Kind Hearts and Coronets]]'' and ''[[The Man in the White Suit]]'', and [[Carol Reed]] directed his influential thrillers ''[[Odd Man Out]]'', ''[[The Fallen Idol (film)|The Fallen Idol]]'' and ''[[The Third Man]]''. [[David Lean]] was also rapidly becoming a force in world cinema with ''[[Brief Encounter]]'' and his [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]] adaptations ''[[Great Expectations (1946 film)|Great Expectations]]'' and ''[[Oliver Twist (1948 film)|Oliver Twist]]'', and [[Michael Powell]] and [[Emeric Pressburger]] would experience the best of their creative partnership with films like ''[[Black Narcissus]]'' and ''[[The Red Shoes (1948 film)|The Red Shoes]]''.\n\n==1950s==\n{{Main|1950s in film}}\n[[File:Charlton Heston as Antony in Julius Caesar, B&W image by Chalmers Butterfield.jpg|thumb|300px|A production scene from the 1950 Hollywood film ''[[Julius Caesar (1950 film)|Julius Caesar]]'' starring [[Charlton Heston]].]]\nThe [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] investigated Hollywood in the early 1950s. Protested by the [[Hollywood blacklist|Hollywood Ten]] before the committee, the hearings resulted in the [[blacklist]]ing of many actors, writers and directors, including Chayefsky, [[Charlie Chaplin]], and [[Dalton Trumbo]], and many of these fled to Europe, especially the United Kingdom.\n\nThe [[Cold War|Cold War era]] [[zeitgeist]] translated into a type of near-[[paranoia]] manifested in [[theme (literature)|theme]]s such as [[alien invasion|invading armies of evil aliens]], (''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', ''[[The War of the Worlds (1953 film)|The War of the Worlds]]''); and [[communism|communist]] [[fifth column]]ists, (''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]'').\n\nDuring the immediate post-war years the cinematic industry was also threatened by television, and the increasing popularity of the medium meant that some film theatres would bankrupt and close. The demise of the \"studio system\" spurred the [[Criticism|self-commentary]] of films like ''[[Sunset Boulevard (1950 film)|Sunset Boulevard]]'' (1950) and ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1950, the [[Lettrists]] avante-gardists caused riots at the [[Cannes Film Festival]], when [[Isidore Isou]]'s ''Treatise on Slime and Eternity'' was screened. After their criticism of [[Charlie Chaplin]] and split with the movement, the [[Ultra-Lettrist]]s continued to cause disruptions when they showed their new [[hypergraphics|hypergraphical]] techniques.\nThe most notorious film is [[Guy Debord]]'s ''Howls for Sade'' of 1952.\n\nDistressed by the increasing number of closed theatres, studios and companies would find new and innovative ways to bring audiences back. These included attempts to widen their appeal with new screen formats. [[Cinemascope]], which would remain a [[20th Century Fox]] distinction until 1967, was announced with 1953's ''[[The Robe (film)|The Robe]]''. [[VistaVision]], [[Cinerama]], and [[Todd-AO]] boasted a \"bigger is better\" approach to [[marketing]] films to a dwindling US audience. This resulted in the revival of epic films to take advantage of the new big screen formats. Some of the most successful examples of these [[Bible|Biblical]] and [[history|historical]] spectaculars include ''[[The Ten Commandments (1956 film)|The Ten Commandments]]'' (1956), ''[[The Vikings (film)|The Vikings]]'' (1958), ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben-Hur]]'' (1959), ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' (1960) and ''[[El Cid (film)|El Cid]]'' (1961). Also during this period a number of other significant films were produced in [[Todd-AO]], developed by [[Mike Todd]] shortly before his death, including [[Oklahoma!]] (1955), [[Around the World in 80 Days (1956 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]] (1956), [[South Pacific (1958 film)|South Pacific]] (1958) and [[Cleopatra]] (1963) plus many more.\n\n[[Gimmick]]s also proliferated to lure in audiences. The fad for [[3-D film]] would last for only two years, 1952\u20131954, and helped sell ''[[House of Wax (1953 film)|House of Wax]]'' and ''[[Creature from the Black Lagoon]]''. Producer [[William Castle]] would tout films featuring \"Emergo\" \"Percepto\", the first of a series of gimmicks that would remain popular marketing tools for Castle and others throughout the 1960s.\n\nIn the U.S., a post-WW2 tendency toward questioning the establishment and societal norms and the early [[activism]] of the [[civil rights movement]] was reflected in Hollywood films such as ''[[Blackboard Jungle]]'' (1955), ''[[On the Waterfront]]'' (1954), [[Paddy Chayefsky]]'s ''[[Marty (film)|Marty]]'' and [[Reginald Rose]]'s ''[[12 Angry Men (1957 film)|12 Angry Men]]'' (1957). Disney continued making animated films, notably; ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'' (1950), ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' (1953), ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (1955), and ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (1959). He began, however, getting more involved in live action films, producing classics like ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954), and ''[[Old Yeller (1957 film)|Old Yeller]]'' (1957). Television began competing seriously with films projected in theatres, but surprisingly it promoted more filmgoing rather than curtailing it.\n\n''[[Limelight (1952 film)|Limelight]]'' is probably a unique film in at least one interesting respect. Its two leads, [[Charlie Chaplin]] and [[Claire Bloom]], were in the industry in no less than three different centuries. In the 19th Century, Chaplin made his theatrical debut at the age of eight, in 1897, in a clog dancing troupe, The Eight Lancaster Lads. In the 21st Century, Bloom is still enjoying a full and productive career, having appeared in dozens of films and television series produced up to and including 2013. She received particular acclaim for her role in ''[[The King's Speech]]'' (2010).\n\n===Golden age of Asian cinema===\n{{Main|Asian cinema}}\n[[File:Satyajit Ray.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Satyajit Ray]], [[India]]n [[Bengali people|Bengali]] film director.]]\nFollowing the end of World War II in the 1940s, the following decade, the 1950s, marked a 'golden age' for non-English [[world cinema]],<ref>{{cite web|title=The Golden Age of the Foreign Film |publisher=[[Film Forum]] |url=http://www.filmforum.org/archivedfilms/golden.html |accessdate=2009-05-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080619154125/http://www.filmforum.org/archivedfilms/golden.html |archivedate=19 June 2008 }}</ref><ref name=Daniels>{{cite web|title=Hybrid Cinematics: Rethinking the role of filmmakers of color in American Cinema|author=Tracy K.

''Rashomon'' was also remade as ''[[The Outrage]]'' (1964), and inspired films with \"[[Rashomon effect]]\" storytelling methods, such as ''[[Andha Naal]]'' (1954), ''[[The Usual Suspects]]'' (1995) and ''[[Hero (2002 film)|Hero]]'' (2002). ''The Hidden Fortress'' was also the inspiration behind [[George Lucas]]' ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' (1977).

Both the quality and quantity of filmmaking had increased rapidly by the end of the 1950s. South Korean films, such as Lee Byeong-il's 1956 comedy ''Sijibganeun nal (The Wedding Day)'', had begun winning international awards. In contrast to the beginning of the 1950s, when only 5 films were made per year, 111 films were produced in South Korea in 1959.<ref>{{cite web|first=Darcy|last=Paquet|title=1945\u20131959|publisher=Korean Film Page|url=http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm45-59.html|accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref>\n\nThe 1950s was also a 'Golden Age' for [[Cinema of the Philippines|Philippine cinema]], with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers.

Productions like ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'' (1964), ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]'' (1964) and ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' (1965) were among the biggest money-makers of the decade. The growth in independent producers and production companies, and the increase in the power of individual actors also contributed to the decline of traditional Hollywood studio production.\n\nThere was also an increasing awareness of foreign language cinema in America during this period. During the late 1950s and 1960s, the [[French New Wave]] directors such as [[Fran\u00e7ois Truffaut]] and [[Jean-Luc Godard]] produced films such as ''[[The 400 Blows|Les quatre cents coups]]'', ''[[Breathless (1960 film)|Breathless]]'' and ''[[Jules et Jim]]'' which broke the rules of Hollywood cinema's [[narrative structure]]. As well, audiences were becoming aware of Italian films like [[Federico Fellini]]'s ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'' and the stark dramas of Sweden's [[Ingmar Bergman]].\n\nIn Britain, the \"Free Cinema\" of [[Lindsay Anderson]], [[Tony Richardson]] and others lead to a group of realistic and innovative dramas including ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'', ''[[A Kind of Loving (film)|A Kind of Loving]]'' and ''[[This Sporting Life]]''. Other British films such as ''[[Repulsion (film)|Repulsion]]'', ''[[Darling (1965 film)|Darling]]'', ''[[Alfie (1966 film)|Alfie]]'', ''[[Blowup]]'' and ''[[Georgy Girl]]'' (all in 1965\u20131966) helped to reduce prohibitions of sex and nudity on screen, while the casual sex and violence of the [[James Bond]] films, beginning with ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'' in 1962 would render the series popular worldwide.\n\nDuring the 1960s, [[Ousmane Semb\u00e8ne]] produced several French- and [[Wolof language|Wolof-language]] films and became the \"father\" of [[African Cinema]]. In Latin America, the dominance of the \"Hollywood\" model was challenged by many film makers. [[Fernando Solanas]] and [[Octavio Getino]] called for a politically engaged [[Third Cinema]] in contrast to Hollywood and the European [[auteur]] cinema.\n\nFurther, the nuclear paranoia of the age, and the threat of an apocalyptic nuclear exchange (like the 1962 close-call with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] during the [[Cuban missile crisis]]) prompted a reaction within the film community as well. Films like [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' and ''[[Fail-Safe (1964 film)|Fail Safe]]'' with [[Henry Fonda]] were produced in a Hollywood that was once known for its overt patriotism and wartime propaganda.\n\nIn [[documentary film]] the sixties saw the blossoming of [[Direct Cinema]], an observational style of film making as well as the advent of more overtly partisan films like ''[[In the Year of the Pig]]'' about the [[Vietnam War]] by [[Emile de Antonio]]. By the late 1960s however, Hollywood filmmakers were beginning to create more innovative and groundbreaking films that reflected the social revolution taken over much of the western world such as ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' (1967), ''[[The Graduate]]'' (1967), ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968), ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' (1968), ''[[Midnight Cowboy]]'' (1969), ''[[Easy Rider]]'' (1969) and ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' (1969). ''[[Bonnie and Clyde (film)|Bonnie and Clyde]]'' is often considered the beginning of the so-called [[New Hollywood]].\n\nIn Japanese cinema, Academy Award-winning director [[Akira Kurosawa]] produced ''[[Yojimbo (film)|Yojimbo]]'' (1961), which like his previous films also had a profound influence around the world. The influence of this film is most apparent in [[Sergio Leone]]'s ''[[A Fistful of Dollars]]'' (1964) and [[Walter Hill (filmmaker)|Walter Hill]]'s ''[[Last Man Standing (1996 film)|Last Man Standing]]'' (1996). ''Yojimbo'' was also the origin of the \"[[Man with No Name]]\" trend.\n\n==1970s==\n{{Main|1970s in film}}\nThe [[New Hollywood]] was the period following the decline of the [[studio system]] during the 1950s and 1960s and the end of the [[production code]], (which was replaced in 1968 by the [[MPAA film rating system]]). During the 1970s, filmmakers increasingly depicted explicit sexual content and showed gunfight and battle scenes that included graphic images of bloody deaths{{snd}} a good example of this is [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]'' (1972).\n\nPost-classical cinema is the changing methods of storytelling of the New Hollywood producers. The new methods of [[drama]] and characterization played upon audience expectations acquired during the classical/Golden Age period: story chronology may be scrambled, storylines may feature unsettling \"[[twist ending]]s\", main characters may behave in a morally ambiguous fashion, and the lines between the [[antagonist]] and [[protagonist]] may be blurred. The beginnings of post-classical storytelling may be seen in 1940s and 1950s [[film noir]] films, in films such as ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'' (1955), and in Hitchcock's ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]''. 1971 marked the release of controversial films like ''[[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', ''[[The French Connection (film)|The French Connection]]'' and ''[[Dirty Harry]]''. This sparked heated controversy over the perceived escalation of violence in cinema.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a new group of American filmmakers emerged, such as [[Martin Scorsese]], [[Francis Ford Coppola]], [[George Lucas]], [[Woody Allen]], [[Terrence Malick]], and [[Robert Altman]]. This coincided with the increasing popularity of the [[auteur theory]] in film literature and the media, which posited that a film director's films express their personal vision and creative insights. The development of the auteur style of filmmaking helped to give these directors far greater control over their projects than would have been possible in earlier eras. This led to some great critical and commercial successes, like Scorsese's ''[[Taxi Driver]]'', Coppola's ''[[The Godfather]]'' films, [[William Friedkin]]'s ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', Altman's ''[[Nashville (film)|Nashville]]'', Allen's ''[[Annie Hall]]'' and ''[[Manhattan (film)|Manhattan]]'', Malick's ''[[Badlands (film)|Badlands]]'' and ''[[Days of Heaven]]'', and Polish immigrant [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''. It also, however, resulted in some failures, including [[Peter Bogdanovich]]'s ''[[At Long Last Love]]'' and [[Michael Cimino]]'s hugely expensive Western epic ''[[Heaven's Gate (film)|Heaven's Gate]]'', which helped to bring about the demise of its backer, [[United Artists]].\n\nThe financial disaster of ''Heaven's Gate'' marked the end of the visionary \"auteur\" directors of the \"New Hollywood\", who had unrestrained creative and financial freedom to develop films. The phenomenal success in the 1970s of [[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]]'s ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' originated the concept of the modern \"[[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]]\". However, the enormous success of George Lucas' 1977 film ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' led to much more than just the popularization of blockbuster film-making. The film's revolutionary use of special effects, sound editing and music had led it to become widely regarded as one of the single most important films in the medium's history, as well as the most influential film of the 1970s. Hollywood studios increasingly focused on producing a smaller number of very large budget films with massive marketing and promotional campaigns. This trend had already been foreshadowed by the commercial success of [[disaster film]]s such as ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (1972 film)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' and ''[[The Towering Inferno (film)|The Towering Inferno]]''.\n\nDuring the mid-1970s, more pornographic theatres, euphemistically called \"adult cinemas\", were established, and the legal production of [[hardcore pornography|hardcore pornographic]] films began. Porn films such as ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' and its star [[Linda Lovelace]] became something of a popular culture phenomenon and resulted in a spate of similar sex films. The porn cinemas finally died out during the 1980s, when the popularization of the home [[VCR]] and pornography videotapes allowed audiences to watch sex films at home. In the early 1970s, English-language audiences became more aware of the new [[West German]] cinema, with [[Werner Herzog]], [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]] and [[Wim Wenders]] among its leading exponents.\n\nIn [[world cinema]], the 1970s saw a dramatic increase in the popularity of [[martial arts film]]s, largely due to its reinvention by [[Bruce Lee]], who departed from the artistic style of traditional [[Chinese martial arts]] films and added a much greater sense of realism to them with his [[Jeet Kune Do]] style. This began with ''[[The Big Boss]]'' (1971), which was a major success across [[Asian cinema|Asia]]. However, he didn't gain fame in the [[Western world]] until shortly after his death in 1973, when ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' was released. The film went on to become the most successful martial arts film in cinematic history, popularized the martial arts film genre across the world, and cemented Bruce Lee's status as a cultural icon. [[Hong Kong action cinema]], however, was in decline due to a wave of \"[[Bruceploitation]]\" films. This trend eventually came to an end in 1978 with the martial arts [[comedy film]]s, ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]'', directed by [[Yuen Woo-ping]] and starring [[Jackie Chan]], laying the foundations for the rise of Hong Kong action cinema in the 1980s.\n\nWhile the [[musical film]] genre had declined in Hollywood by this time, musical films were quickly gaining popularity in the [[cinema of India]], where the term \"[[Bollywood]]\" was coined for the growing [[Hindi]] film industry in [[Mumbai|Bombay]] (now Mumbai) that ended up dominating [[South Asian cinema]], overtaking the more critically acclaimed [[Cinema of West Bengal|Bengali film industry]] in popularity. Hindi filmmakers combined the Hollywood musical formula with the conventions of ancient [[Theatre of India|Indian theatre]] to create a new film genre called \"[[Masala (film genre)|Masala]]\", which dominated Indian cinema throughout the late 20th century.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Indian Popular Cinema: A Narrative of Cultural Change|last=K. Moti Gokulsing|first=K. Gokulsing, Wimal Dissanayake|publisher=Trentham Books|year=2004|isbn=1-85856-329-1|pages=98\u201399}}</ref> These \"Masala\" films portrayed [[Action film|action]], comedy, [[Drama film|drama]], [[Romance film|romance]] and [[melodrama]] all at once, with \"[[filmi]]\" song and dance routines thrown in. This trend began with films directed by [[Manmohan Desai]] and starring [[Amitabh Bachchan]], who remains one of the most popular [[film star]]s in South Asia. The most popular Indian film of all time was ''[[Sholay]]'' (1975), a \"Masala\" film inspired by a real-life [[Dacoity|dacoit]] as well as Kurosawa's ''[[Seven Samurai]]'' and the [[Spaghetti Western]]s.\n\nThe end of the decade saw the first major international marketing of [[Australia]]n cinema, as [[Peter Weir]]'s films ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' and ''[[The Last Wave]]'' and [[Fred Schepisi]]'s ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith (film)|The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' gained critical acclaim. In 1979, Australian filmmaker [[George Miller (producer)|George Miller]] also garnered international attention for his violent, low-budget action film ''[[Mad Max]]''.\n\n==1980s==\n{{Main|1980s in film}}\nDuring the 1980s, audiences began increasingly watching films on their home [[VCR]]s. In the early part of that decade, the [[film studio]]s tried legal action to ban home ownership of VCRs as a violation of [[copyright]], which proved unsuccessful. Eventually, the sale and rental of films on [[home video]] became a significant \"second venue\" for exhibition of films, and an additional source of revenue for the film industries. [[Direct-to-video]] (niche) markets usually offered lower quality, cheap productions that were not deemed very suitable for the general audiences of television and theatrical releases.\n\nThe [[George Lucas|Lucas]]\u2013[[Steven Spielberg|Spielberg]] combine would dominate \"Hollywood\" cinema for much of the 1980s, and lead to much imitation. Two follow-ups to ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'', three to ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', and three ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' films helped to make sequels of successful films more of an expectation than ever before. Lucas also launched [[THX|THX Ltd]], a division of [[Lucasfilm]] in 1982,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thx.com/mod/company/milestones.html |title=THX Milestones |accessdate=2006-11-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109131348/http://www.thx.com/mod/company/milestones.html |archivedate=2006-11-09}}</ref> while Spielberg enjoyed one of the decade's greatest successes in ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'' the same year. 1982 also saw the release of Disney's ''[[Tron]]'' which was one of the first films from a major studio to use [[computer graphics]] extensively. American independent cinema struggled more during the decade, although [[Martin Scorsese]]'s ''[[Raging Bull]]'' (1980), ''[[After Hours (film)|After Hours]]'' (1985), and ''[[The King of Comedy (film)|The King of Comedy]]'' (1983) helped to establish him as one of the most critically acclaimed American film makers of the era. Also during 1983 ''[[Scarface (1983 film)|Scarface]]'' was released, which was very profitable and resulted in even greater fame for its leading actor [[Al Pacino]]. Probably{{weasel inline|date=August 2018}} the most successful film commercially was [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 version of [[Bob Kane]]'s creation, ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'', which broke box-office records. [[Jack Nicholson]]'s portrayal of the demented [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] earned him a total of $60,000,000 after figuring in his percentage of the gross.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}\n\nBritish cinema was given a boost during the early 1980s by the arrival of [[David Puttnam]]'s company [[Goldcrest Films]]. The films ''[[Chariots of Fire]]'', ''[[Gandhi (film)|Gandhi]]'', ''[[The Killing Fields (film)|The Killing Fields]]'' and ''[[A Room with a View (1986 film)|A Room with a View]]'' appealed to a \"middlebrow\" audience which was increasingly being ignored by the major Hollywood studios. While the films of the 1970s had helped to define modern [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster]] motion pictures, the way \"Hollywood\" released its films would now change. Films, for the most part, would premiere in a wider number of theatres, although, to this day, some films still premiere using the route of the [[Roadshow theatrical release|limited/roadshow release system]]. Against some expectations, the rise of the multiplex cinema did not allow less mainstream films to be shown, but simply allowed the major blockbusters to be given an even greater number of screenings. However, films that had been overlooked in cinemas were increasingly being given a second chance on home video.\n\n[[File:Cannes_2014_2.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Ensemble cast of action stars end of the 80's \t\n[[Sylvester Stallone]], [[Antonio Banderas]], [[Jet Li]], [[Wesley Snipes]], [[Dolph Lundgren]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Randy Couture]], [[Kellan Lutz]], [[Ronda Rousey]], [[Glen Powell]], [[Victor Ortiz]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Harrison Ford]], and [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]]]\nDuring the 1980s, [[Japanese cinema]] experienced a revival, largely due to the success of [[anime]] films. At the beginning of the 1980s, ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'' (1973) and ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam]]'' (1979), both of which were unsuccessful as television series, were remade as films and became hugely successful in Japan. In particular, ''Mobile Suit Gundam'' sparked the [[Gundam]] franchise of [[Real Robot]] [[mecha]] anime. The success of ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross: Do You Remember Love?|Macross: Do You Remember Love?]]'' also sparked a [[Macross]] franchise of mecha anime. This was also the decade when [[Studio Ghibli]] was founded. The studio produced [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s first [[fantasy film]]s, ''[[Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind (film)|Nausica\u00e4 of the Valley of the Wind]]'' (1984) and ''[[Castle in the Sky]]'' (1986), as well as [[Isao Takahata]]'s ''[[Grave of the Fireflies]]'' (1988), all of which were very successful in Japan and received worldwide critical acclaim. [[Original video animation]] (OVA) films also began during this decade; the most influential of these early OVA films was [[Noboru Ishiguro]]'s [[cyberpunk]] film ''[[Megazone 23]]'' (1985). The most famous anime film of this decade was [[Katsuhiro Otomo]]'s cyberpunk film ''[[Akira (1988 film)|Akira]]'' (1988), which although initially unsuccessful at Japanese theaters, went on to become an international success.\n\n[[Hong Kong action cinema]], which was in a state of decline due to endless [[Bruceploitation]] films after the death of [[Bruce Lee]], also experienced a revival in the 1980s, largely due to the reinvention of the [[action film]] genre by [[Jackie Chan]]. He had previously combined the [[comedy film]] and [[martial arts film]] genres successfully in the 1978 films ''[[Snake in the Eagle's Shadow]]'' and ''[[Drunken Master]]''. The next step he took was in combining this comedy martial arts genre with a new emphasis on elaborate and highly dangerous [[stunt]]s, reminiscent of the [[silent film]] era. The first film in this new style of action cinema was ''[[Project A]]'' (1983), which saw the formation of the [[Jackie Chan Stunt Team]] as well as the \"Three Brothers\" (Chan, [[Sammo Hung]] and [[Yuen Biao]]). The film added elaborate, dangerous stunts to the fights and [[slapstick]] humor, and became a huge success throughout the [[Far East]]. As a result, Chan continued this trend with martial arts action films containing even more elaborate and dangerous stunts, including ''[[Wheels on Meals]]'' (1984), ''[[Police Story (1985 film)|Police Story]]'' (1985), ''[[Armour of God (film)|Armour of God]]'' (1986), ''[[Project A Part II]]'' (1987), ''[[Police Story 2]]'' (1988), and ''[[Dragons Forever]]'' (1988). Other new trends which began in the 1980s were the \"[[girls with guns]]\" subgenre, for which [[Michelle Yeoh]] gained fame; and especially the \"[[heroic bloodshed]]\" genre, revolving around [[Triad (underground societies)|Triads]], largely pioneered by [[John Woo]] and for which [[Chow Yun-fat]] became famous. These Hong Kong action trends were later adopted by many Hollywood action films in the 1990s and 2000s.\n\n==1990s==\n{{Main|1990s in film}}\nThe early 1990s saw the development of a commercially successful independent cinema in the United States. Although cinema was increasingly dominated by special-effects films such as ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]'' (1991), ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'' (1993) and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' (1997), the latter of which became the highest-grossing film of all time at the time up until ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' (2009), also directed by James Cameron, independent films like [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[Sex, Lies, and Videotape]]'' (1989) and [[Quentin Tarantino]]'s ''[[Reservoir Dogs]]'' (1992) had significant commercial success both at the cinema and on home video. Filmmakers associated with the Danish film movement [[Dogme 95]] introduced a manifesto aimed to purify filmmaking. Its first few films gained worldwide critical acclaim, after which the movement slowly faded out.\n\n[[File:1995cinema admissions.png|thumb|250px|right|Cinema admissions in 1995]]\nMajor American studios began to create their own [[independent film|\"independent\" production companies]] to finance and produce non-mainstream fare. One of the most successful independents of the 1990s, [[Miramax Films]], was bought by Disney the year before the release of Tarantino's runaway hit ''[[Pulp Fiction (film)|Pulp Fiction]]'' in 1994. The same year marked the beginning of film and video distribution online. Animated films aimed at family audiences also regained their popularity, with Disney's ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992), and ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994). During 1995, the first feature-length [[Computer animation|computer-animated]] feature, ''[[Toy Story]]'', was produced by [[Pixar|Pixar Animation Studios]] and released by Disney. After the success of Toy Story, computer animation would grow to become the dominant technique for feature-length animation, which would allow competing film companies such as [[DreamWorks Animation]] and [[20th Century Fox]] to effectively compete with Disney with successful films of their own. During the late 1990s, another cinematic transition began, from physical film stock to [[digital cinema]] technology. Meanwhile, [[DVD]]s became the new standard for consumer video, replacing VHS tapes.\n\n==2000s==\n{{Main|2000s in film}}\nSince the late 2000s [[streaming media]] platforms like [[YouTube]] provided means for anyone with access to internet and cameras (a standard feature of [[smartphones]]) to publish videos to the world. Also competing with the increasing popularity of [[video games]] and other forms of [[Home entertainment (disambiguation)|home entertainment]], the industry once again started to make theatrical releases more attractive, with new 3D technologies and epic (fantasy and superhero) films becoming a mainstay in cinemas.\n\nThe [[documentary film]] also rose as a commercial genre for perhaps the first time, with the success of films such as ''[[March of the Penguins]]'' and [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' and ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]''. A new genre was created with [[Martin Kunert]] and [[Eric Manes]]' ''[[Voices of Iraq]]'', when 150 inexpensive DV cameras were distributed across Iraq, transforming ordinary people into collaborative filmmakers. The success of ''[[Gladiator (2000 film)|Gladiator]]'' led to a revival of interest in [[epic film|epic cinema]], and ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'' renewed interest in [[musical film|musical cinema]]. [[home cinema|Home theatre]] systems became increasingly sophisticated, as did some of the special edition [[DVD]]s designed to be shown on them. ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings trilogy]]'' was released on DVD in both the theatrical version and in a special extended version intended only for home cinema audiences.\n\nIn 2001, the [[Harry Potter (film series)|''Harry Potter'' film series]] began, and by its end in 2011, it had become the highest-grossing film franchise of all time until the Marvel Cinematic Universe passed it in 2015.\n\nMore films were also being released simultaneously to [[IMAX]] cinema, the first was in 2002's Disney animation ''[[Treasure Planet]]''; and the first live action was in 2003's ''[[The Matrix Revolutions]]'' and a re-release of ''[[The Matrix Reloaded]]''. Later in the decade, ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' was the first major feature film to have been at least partially shot in IMAX technology.\n\nThere has been an increasing globalization of cinema during this decade, with foreign-language films gaining popularity in English-speaking markets. Examples of such films include ''[[Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon]]'' (Mandarin), ''[[Am\u00e9lie]]'' (French), ''[[Lagaan]]'' (Hindi), ''[[Spirited Away]]'' (Japanese), ''[[City of God (2002 film)|City of God]]'' (Brazilian Portuguese), ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'' (Aramaic), ''[[Apocalypto]]'' (Mayan) and ''[[Inglourious Basterds]]'' (multiple European languages). Italy is the most awarded country at the [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]], with 14 awards won, 3 Special Awards and 31 [[List of Italian submissions for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|nominations]].\n\nIn 2003, there was a revival in 3D film popularity the first being James Cameron's ''[[Ghosts of the Abyss]]'' which was released as the first full-length 3-D IMAX feature filmed with the [[Reality Camera System]]. This camera system used the latest HD video cameras, not film, and was built for Cameron by Emmy nominated Director of Photography Vince Pace, to his specifications. The same camera system was used to film ''[[Spy Kids 3D: Game Over]]'' (2003), ''[[Aliens of the Deep]]'' IMAX (2005), and ''[[The Adventures of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 3-D]]'' (2005).\n\nAfter James Cameron's 3D film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' became the highest-grossing film of all time, 3D films gained brief popularity with many other films being released in 3D, with the best critical and financial successes being in the field of feature film animation such as [[Universal Pictures]]/[[Illumination Entertainment]]'s ''[[Despicable Me]]'' and [[DreamWorks Animation]]'s ''[[How To Train Your Dragon (film)|How To Train Your Dragon]]'', ''[[Shrek Forever After]]'' and ''[[Megamind]]''. ''Avatar'' is also note-worthy for pioneering highly sophisticated use of motion capture technology and influencing several other films such as ''[[Rise of the Planet of the Apes]]''.<ref>https://variety.com/2018/film/news/3d-box-office-1202743603/</ref>\n\n==2010s==\n{{Main|2010s in film}}\n\n{{as of|2011}}, the largest film industries by number of feature films produced were those of India, the United States, China, Nigeria and Japan.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2044888,00.html| title=As Its Box Office Booms, Chinese Cinema Makes a 3-D Push | work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Brenhouse, Hillary|date=2011-01-31| accessdate=2011-10-18}}</ref>\n\nIn Hollywood, [[superhero film]]s have greatly increased in popularity and financial success, with films based on [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[DC Comics|DC comics]] regularly being released every year up to the present.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Helmore|first1=Edward|title=They're here to save the world: but how many superhero movies can we take?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/nov/01/superhero-movies-black-panther-captain-marvel|accessdate=29 November 2015|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=1 November 2014}}</ref> {{as of|2019|}}, the superhero genre has been the most dominant genre as far as [[List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada|American box office receipts]] are concerned.
