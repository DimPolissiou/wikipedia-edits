There are ten different recognised schools of ''qira'at'', each one deriving its name from a noted Quran reciter or \"reader\" (''Qari''). Each reciter recited to two narrators whose narrations are known as ''riwaya'' (transmissions) and named after its primary narrator.  Each ''Rawi'' (singular of ''riwaya'') has ''turuq'' (transmission lines) with more variants created by  notable students of the master who recited them and named after the student of the master. Passed down from  ''Turuq'' are  ''wujuh'': the ''wajh'' of so-and-so from the ''tariq'' of so-and-so. There are about twenty ''riwayat'' and eighty ''turuq''.<ref name=Bewley/>\n\nVarious [[hadith]]\u2014where Muhammad listens to recitations of various [[Companions of the Prophet|companion]]s and approves of each of them,<ref name=\"Munajjid\"/> or corrects [[Umar]]'s berating another [[Companions of the Prophet|companion]]'s recitation saying the \"Quran has been revealed in seven ''[[Ahruf]]''\",<ref name=\"muw\"/> or claim Muhammad asked the angel [[Gabriel#Islam|Jibreel]] to teach him different styles of recitation until he had learned seven<ref name=bukhari-Muslim/>\u2014provide an Islamic basis for the different variants (''[[Ahruf]]'') of the Quran.

''Ahruf'' variants were more significant (involving differences in the consonants of the some words of the Quran) and Caliph 'Uthman is believed to have eliminated all but one.<ref name=FMDQiRS2008:35-6/> The seven ''Qira'at''  readings which are currently notable were selected by [[Abu Bakr Ibn Mujahid]] (died 324 AH, 936 CE) from prominent reciters of his time, three from [[Kufa]] and one each from [[Mecca]], [[Medina]], and [[Basra]] and [[Damascus]].<ref name=MCKaVSI2000:73>[[#MCKaVSI2000|Cook, ''The Koran'', 2000]]: p.73</ref>  \n\n[[Bilal Philips]] writes that the Quran continued to be read according to the seven ''ahruf'' until midway through Caliph 'Uthman's rule, when confusion developed in the outlying provinces about the Quran's recitation. Some Arab tribes boasted about the superiority of their ''ahruf'', and rivalries began; new Muslims also began combining the forms of recitation out of ignorance. Caliph 'Uthman decided to make official copies of the Quran according to the writing conventions of the [[Quraysh]] and send them with the Quranic reciters to the Islamic centres. His decision was approved by Sahaabah, and all unofficial copies of the Quran were ordered destroyed; Uthman carried out the order. After the distribution of the official copies, the other ahruf were dropped and the Quran began to be read in one ''harf''. The Quran which is currently available worldwide is written and recited according to the ''harf'' of Quraysh.<ref name=\"ri\">Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips, Tafseer Soorah Al-Hujuraat, 1990, Tawheed Publications, Riyadh, p. 28-29</ref>\n\nPhilips writes that ''Qira'at'' is primarily a method of pronunciation used in recitations of the Quran. These methods are different from the seven forms, or modes (''ahruf''), in which the Quran was revealed. The methods have been traced back to Muhammad through a number of ''Sahaabah'' (companions) who were noted for their Quranic recitations; they recited the Quran to Muhammad (or in his presence), and received his approval. The ''Sahaabah'' included: \n*Ubayy Ibn Kab]\n*[[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]] \n*Zayd Ibn Thaabit \n*Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud \n*Abu ad-Dardaa\n*Abu Musa al-Ash'aree \nMany of the other Sahaabah learned from them; master Quran commentator Ibn 'Abbaas learned from Ubayy and Zayd.<ref name=\"ri\"/> (pp.&nbsp;29\u201330)\n\nAccording to Philips, in the next generation of Muslims (referred to as ''[[Tabi'in]]'') were many scholars who learned the methods of recitation from the ''Sahaabah'' and taught them to others. Centres of Quranic recitation developed in al-Madeenah, Makkah, Kufa, Basrah and Syria, leading to the development of Quranic recitation as a science. By the mid-eighth century CE, a large number of scholars were considered specialists in the field of recitation. Most of their methods were authenticated by chains of reliable narrators, ending with Muhammad. The methods which were supported by a large number of reliable narrators on each level of their chain were called ''mutawaatir'', and were considered the most accurate. Methods in which the number of narrators were few (or only one) on any level of the chain were known as ''shaadhdh''. Some scholars of the following period began the practice of designating a set number of individual scholars from the previous period as the most noteworthy and accurate. The number seven became popular by the mid-10th century, since it coincided with the number of dialects in which the Quran was revealed.<ref name=\"ri\"/> (p.&nbsp;30)\n\n[[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]] writes about hadith in Muwatta<ref name=\"muw\"/> that if Ahruf are taken in the context of pronunciation (for which the words are ''lughat'' and ''lahjat''), the content of the hadith rejects this meaning; [[Umar]] and [[Hisham ibn Urwah|Hisham]] belonged to the same tribe (the [[Quraysh]]), and members of the same tribe cannot use different pronunciations. Ghamidi questions the hadith which claim \"variant readings\", on the basis of Quranic verses ({{quran-usc-range|87|6-7}}, {{quran-usc-range|75|16-19}}), the Quran was compiled during Muhammad's lifetime and questions the hadith which report its compilation during [[Uthman]]'s reign.<ref name=\"jav\"/> Since most of these narrations are reported by [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]], Imam Layth Ibn Sa'd wrote to [[Imam Malik]]:<ref name=\"jav\"/><ref>[[Ibn Qayyim]], I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in, vol. 3 (Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, n.d.), 96.</ref>\n{{quote|And when we would meet Ibn Shihab, there would arise a difference of opinion in many issues.

It is because of this that I have left him \u2013 something which you did not like.}}\n\nAbu 'Ubayd Qasim Ibn Sallam (died 224 [[Hijri year|AH]]) reportedly selected twenty-five readings in his book. The seven readings which are currently notable were selected by [[Abu Bakr Ibn Mujahid]] (died 324 AH, 936 CE) at the end of the third century. It is generally accepted that although their number cannot be ascertained, every reading is Quran which has been reported through a chain of narration and is [[Arabic|linguistically]] correct. Some readings are regarded as ''mutawatir'', but their chains of narration indicate that they are ''ahad'' (isolate) and their narrators are suspect in the eyes of ''[[Biographical evaluation|rijal]]'' authorities.<ref name=\"jav\"/>\n\n==Quranic orthography==\nTo ensure the correct reading of the Quran (particularly for those following the first generation of Muslims), gradual steps were taken to improve its [[orthography]]. This began with the introduction of dots to distinguish similarly-shaped consonants, followed by dots (to indicate different vowels) and [[nunation]] in different-coloured ink from the text. The work was done primarily by Abu'l Aswad ad-Du'al\u00ee (d. 69 AH/688 CE), Na\u1e63r Ibn \u02bf\u0100\u1e63im (d. 89 AH/707 CE) and Ya\u1e25ya Ibn Ya\u02bfmur (d. 129 AH/746 CE). There was initial opposition to any additions to the Quran. Although Ibn \u02bfUmar (73/692) disliked the dotting, others welcomed it because it ensured the proper reading of the Quran as received from Muhammad; the latter view has been accepted by most Muslims throughout the Muslim world since the [[Tabi'un]]. The people of [[Medina|Madinah]] reportedly used red dots for vowels (''[[tanwin]]'', ''[[Shadda|tashdid]]'', ''takhfif'', ''[[Arabic diacritics#Sukun|sukun]]'', ''wa\u1e63l'' and ''madd'') and yellow dots for [[hamza]]s. ''Naqt'' (dotting the ''[[rasm]]''), became a separate subject of study.\n\n=={{anchor|The Ten Readers and their Transmitters}}The ten readers and their transmitters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The ten readers and their transmitters\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" Style=\"background:#efefef;\"|''Qari'' (reader)\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |''Rawi'' (transmitter)\n|-\n!

There are ten different recognised schools of ''qira'at'', each one deriving its name from a noted Quran reciter or \"reader\" (''Qari''). Each reciter recited to two narrators whose narrations are known as ''riwaya'' (transmissions) and named after its primary narrator.  Each ''Rawi'' (singular of ''riwaya'') has ''turuq'' (transmission lines) with more variants created by  notable students of the master who recited them and named after the student of the master. Passed down from  ''Turuq'' are  ''wujuh'': the ''wajh'' of so-and-so from the ''tariq'' of so-and-so.

Some Arab tribes boasted about the superiority of their ''ahruf'', and rivalries began; new Muslims also began combining the forms of recitation out of ignorance. Caliph 'Uthman decided to make official copies of the Quran according to the writing conventions of the [[Quraysh]] and send them with the Quranic reciters to the Islamic centres. His decision was approved by Sahaabah, and all unofficial copies of the Quran were ordered destroyed; Uthman carried out the order. After the distribution of the official copies, the other ahruf were dropped and the Quran began to be read in one ''harf''. The Quran which is currently available worldwide is written and recited according to the ''harf'' of Quraysh.<ref name=\"ri\">Abu Ameenah Bilal Philips, Tafseer Soorah Al-Hujuraat, 1990, Tawheed Publications, Riyadh, p. 28-29</ref>\n\nPhilips writes that ''Qira'at'' is primarily a method of pronunciation used in recitations of the Quran. These methods are different from the seven forms, or modes (''ahruf''), in which the Quran was revealed. The methods have been traced back to Muhammad through a number of ''Sahaabah'' (companions) who were noted for their Quranic recitations; they recited the Quran to Muhammad (or in his presence), and received his approval. The ''Sahaabah'' included: \n*Ubayy Ibn Kab]\n*[[Ali Ibn Abi Talib]] \n*Zayd Ibn Thaabit \n*Abdullah Ibn Mas'ud \n*Abu ad-Dardaa\n*Abu Musa al-Ash'aree \nMany of the other Sahaabah learned from them; master Quran commentator Ibn 'Abbaas learned from Ubayy and Zayd.<ref name=\"ri\"/> (pp.&nbsp;29\u201330)\n\nAccording to Philips, in the next generation of Muslims (referred to as ''[[Tabi'in]]'') were many scholars who learned the methods of recitation from the ''Sahaabah'' and taught them to others. Centres of Quranic recitation developed in al-Madeenah, Makkah, Kufa, Basrah and Syria, leading to the development of Quranic recitation as a science. By the mid-eighth century CE, a large number of scholars were considered specialists in the field of recitation. Most of their methods were authenticated by chains of reliable narrators, ending with Muhammad. The methods which were supported by a large number of reliable narrators on each level of their chain were called ''mutawaatir'', and were considered the most accurate. Methods in which the number of narrators were few (or only one) on any level of the chain were known as ''shaadhdh''. Some scholars of the following period began the practice of designating a set number of individual scholars from the previous period as the most noteworthy and accurate. The number seven became popular by the mid-10th century, since it coincided with the number of dialects in which the Quran was revealed.<ref name=\"ri\"/> (p.&nbsp;30)\n\n[[Javed Ahmad Ghamidi]] writes about hadith in Muwatta<ref name=\"muw\"/> that if Ahruf are taken in the context of pronunciation (for which the words are ''lughat'' and ''lahjat''), the content of the hadith rejects this meaning; [[Umar]] and [[Hisham ibn Urwah|Hisham]] belonged to the same tribe (the [[Quraysh]]), and members of the same tribe cannot use different pronunciations. Ghamidi questions the hadith which claim \"variant readings\", on the basis of Quranic verses ({{quran-usc-range|87|6-7}}, {{quran-usc-range|75|16-19}}), the Quran was compiled during Muhammad's lifetime and questions the hadith which report its compilation during [[Uthman]]'s reign.<ref name=\"jav\"/> Since most of these narrations are reported by [[Ibn Shihab al-Zuhri]], Imam Layth Ibn Sa'd wrote to [[Imam Malik]]:<ref name=\"jav\"/><ref>[[Ibn Qayyim]], I'lam al-Muwaqqi'in, vol. 3 (Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, n.d.), 96.</ref>\n{{quote|And when we would meet Ibn Shihab, there would arise a difference of opinion in many issues.

It is because of this that I have left him \u2013 something which you did not like.}}\n\nAbu 'Ubayd Qasim Ibn Sallam (died 224 [[Hijri year|AH]]) reportedly selected twenty-five readings in his book. The seven readings which are currently notable were selected by [[Abu Bakr Ibn Mujahid]] (died 324 AH, 936 CE) at the end of the third century. It is generally accepted that although their number cannot be ascertained, every reading is Quran which has been reported through a chain of narration and is [[Arabic|linguistically]] correct. Some readings are regarded as ''mutawatir'', but their chains of narration indicate that they are ''ahad'' (isolate) and their narrators are suspect in the eyes of ''[[Biographical evaluation|rijal]]'' authorities.<ref name=\"jav\"/>\n\n==Quranic orthography==\nTo ensure the correct reading of the Quran (particularly for those following the first generation of Muslims), gradual steps were taken to improve its [[orthography]]. This began with the introduction of dots to distinguish similarly-shaped consonants, followed by dots (to indicate different vowels) and [[nunation]] in different-coloured ink from the text. The work was done primarily by Abu'l Aswad ad-Du'al\u00ee (d. 69 AH/688 CE), Na\u1e63r Ibn \u02bf\u0100\u1e63im (d. 89 AH/707 CE) and Ya\u1e25ya Ibn Ya\u02bfmur (d. 129 AH/746 CE). There was initial opposition to any additions to the Quran. Although Ibn \u02bfUmar (73/692) disliked the dotting, others welcomed it because it ensured the proper reading of the Quran as received from Muhammad; the latter view has been accepted by most Muslims throughout the Muslim world since the [[Tabi'un]]. The people of [[Medina|Madinah]] reportedly used red dots for vowels (''[[tanwin]]'', ''[[Shadda|tashdid]]'', ''takhfif'', ''[[Arabic diacritics#Sukun|sukun]]'', ''wa\u1e63l'' and ''madd'') and yellow dots for [[hamza]]s. ''Naqt'' (dotting the ''[[rasm]]''), became a separate subject of study.\n\n=={{anchor|The Ten Readers and their Transmitters}}The ten readers and their transmitters==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+The seven readers and their transmitters\n|-\n! colspan=\"5\" Style=\"background:#efefef;\"|''Qari'' (reader)\n! colspan=\"6\" style=\"background:#ffdead;\" |''Rawi'' (transmitter)\n|-\n!

Boxing is overseen by a [[referee (boxing)|referee]] over a series of one- to three-minute intervals called rounds.\n\nA winner can be resolved before the completion of the rounds when a referee deems an opponent incapable of continuing, disqualification of an opponent, or [[Submission (combat sports)|resignation]] of an opponent.

The earliest references to [[musti-yuddha]] come from [[Indian epic poetry|classical Vedic epics]] such as the ''[[Ramayana]]'' and ''[[Rig Veda]]''. The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' describes two combatants boxing with clenched fists and fighting with kicks, finger strikes, knee strikes and headbutts.<ref>[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/m04/m04013.htm Section XIII: ''Samayapalana Parva''], Book 4: ''Virata Parva'', ''[[Mahabharata]]''.</ref> Duels (''niyuddham'') were often fought to the death.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} During the period of the [[Western Satraps]], the ruler [[Rudradaman]] - in addition to being well-versed in \"the great sciences\" which included [[Indian classical music]], [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit grammar]], and logic - was said to be an excellent horseman, charioteer, elephant rider, swordsman and boxer.<ref>{{cite book|title=India: A History|author=John Keay|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2000|isbn=978-0-00-255717-7|page=131|quote=[Rudradaman] was also a fine swordsman and boxer, and excellent horseman, charioteer and elephant-rider ... and far-famed for his knowledge of grammar, music, logic and 'other great sciences'.|author-link=John Keay}}</ref> The ''Gurbilas Shemi'', an 18th-century Sikh text, gives numerous references to musti-yuddha.\n\nIn [[Ancient Greece]] boxing was a well developed sport and enjoyed consistent popularity. In Olympic terms, it was first introduced in the 23rd [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympiad]], 688 BC. The boxers would wind leather thongs around their hands in order to protect them. There were no rounds and boxers fought until one of them acknowledged defeat or could not continue. Weight categories were not used, which meant heavyweights had a tendency to dominate. The style of boxing practiced typically featured an advanced left leg stance, with the left arm semi-extended as a guard, in addition to being used for striking, and with the right arm drawn back ready to strike. It was the head of the opponent which was primarily targeted, and there is little evidence to suggest that targeting the body was common.<ref>Gardiner, E. Norman, 'Boxing' in ''Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals'', London:MacMillan, 1910, p.402, pp.415-416, 419-422</ref>\n\nBoxing was a popular spectator [[sport]] in [[Ancient Rome]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sports Spectators from Antiquity to the Renaissance|last1=Guttmann|first1=Allen|year=1981|volume=8|issue=2|journal=Journal of Sport History|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1981/JSH0802/jsh0802b.pdf|access-date=11 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822123753/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1981/JSH0802/jsh0802b.pdf|archive-date=22 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped [[leather]] thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a [[weapon]]. The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the [[cestus]]. Fighting events were held at Roman [[Amphitheatres]]. The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due consideration. Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD 393, during the Roman [[gladiator]] period, boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Early London prize ring rules===\n[[File:Blow2.jpg|thumb|left|A straight right demonstrated in Edmund Price's ''The Science of Defence: A Treatise on Sparring and Wrestling'', 1867]]\n\nRecords of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western [[Roman Empire]] when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting [[sports]] that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport in [[ancient Rus]] called [[Russian fist fighting|Kulachniy Boy]] or \"Fist Fighting\".\n\nAs the wearing of swords became less common, there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists. The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of [[bare-knuckle boxing]] sometimes referred to as '''prizefighting'''. The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the ''London Protestant Mercury'', and the first English bare-knuckle champion was [[James Figg]] in 1719.<ref name=\"Roberts-1999\">{{cite web |title=James Figg |url=http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/pioneer/figg.html |date=1999 |publisher=[[IBHOF]] |accessdate=2018-03-22}} excerpting {{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=James B. |last2=Skutt |first2=Alexander G. |title=The Boxing Register: International Boxing Hall of Fame Official Record Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aA2LO_DGdu4C |pages= |accessdate=22 March 2018 |edition=4th |year=2006 |publisher=McBooks Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |isbn=978-1-59013-121-3|oclc=819715339}}</ref> This is also the time when the word \"boxing\" first came to be used. This earliest form of modern boxing was very different. Contests in Mr. Figg's time, in addition to fist fighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. On 6 January 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when [[Christopher Monck]], 2nd [[Duke of Albemarle]] (and later [[Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica]]) engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize.\n\nEarly fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. In general, it was extremely chaotic. An early article on boxing was published in Nottingham, 1713, by [[Parkyns baronets|Sir Thomas Parkyns]], a successful Wrestler from [[Bunny, Nottinghamshire]], who had practised the techniques he described. The article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, ''Progymnasmata: The inn-play, or Cornish-hugg wrestler'', described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws, not recognized in boxing today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx13m7QVfb1qa5yan.jpg |title=tumblr_lx13m7QVfb1qa5yan.jpg |publisher=Tumblr |date= |accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first boxing rules, called the Broughton's rules, were introduced by champion [[Jack Broughton]] in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm John Rennie (2006) ''East London Prize Ring Rules 1743''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218094646/http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm |date=18 February 2008 }}</ref> Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or mitten, to be used in 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.\n\n[[File:Cribb vs Molineaux 1811.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Cribb]] vs [[Tom Molineaux]] in a re-match for the heavyweight championship of England, 1811]]\nThese rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today's boxers; they permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to end the round and begin the 30-second count at any time. Thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover. However, this was considered \"unmanly\"<ref>Anonymous (\"A Celebrated Pugilist\"), The Art and Practice of Boxing, 1825</ref> and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the Seconds of the Boxers.<ref>Daniel Mendoza, The Modern Art of Boxing, 1790</ref> In modern boxing, there is a three-minute limit to rounds (unlike the downed fighter ends the round rule). Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system. Furthermore, as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands, they used different punching technique to preserve their hands because the head was a common target to hit full out.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Almost all period manuals have powerful straight punches with the whole body behind them to the face (including forehead) as the basic blows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/8388742/sn/1178659240/name/blow-1.jpg |title=blow-1.jpg |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=16 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024213415/http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/8388742/sn/1178659240/name/blow-1.jpg |archive-date=24 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/classicpugilism/photos/album/1501552404/pic/1874370929/view?picmode=&mode=tn&order=ordinal&start=1&count=20&dir=asc |title=Yahoo!

Rounds were three minutes with one-minute rest intervals between rounds. Each fighter was given a ten-second count if he was knocked down, and wrestling was banned.\nThe introduction of [[boxing gloves|gloves]] of \"fair-size\" also changed the nature of the bouts. An average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/Marquess-of-Queensberry-rules |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2006). ''Queensbury Rules'', Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref>\nThe gloves can be used to block an opponent's blows. As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face.\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===\nThrough the late nineteenth century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy. Outlawed in England and much of the United States, prizefights were often held at gambling venues and broken up by police.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2007/11/15/unlicensed_boxing_feature.shtml|title=BBC - London - History - Unlicensed Boxing|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> Brawling and wrestling tactics continued, and riots at prizefights were common occurrences. Still, throughout this period, there arose some notable bare knuckle champions who developed fairly sophisticated fighting tactics.\n[[File:Amateur Boxing Club, Porthaethwy (7005565417).jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Amateur Boxing Club, Wales 1963]]\nThe English case of ''[[R v.

A majority of young talent still comes from poverty-stricken areas around the world. Places like Mexico, Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe prove to be filled with young aspiring athletes who wish to become the future of boxing. Even in the U.S., places like the inner cities of New York, and Chicago have given rise to promising young talent. According to Rubin, \"boxing lost its appeal with the American middle class, and most of who boxes in modern America come from the streets and are street fighters\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Louis D.|date=2000|title=The Manly art of Modified Mayhem: Dempsey and Others|jstor=27548887|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=108|issue=3|pages=412\u2013432}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n{{main|Marquess of Queensberry Rules}}\nThe ''[[Marquess of Queensberry rules]]'' have been the general rules governing modern boxing since their publication in 1867.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/Marquess-of-Queensberry-rules|title=Marquess of Queensberry rules {{!}} boxing|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-08}}</ref>\n\nA boxing match typically consists of a determined number of three-minute rounds, a total of up to 9 to 12 rounds. A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls.\n\nUp to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches and elbows that connect, defense, knockdowns, hugging and other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or both fighters believe they have been \"robbed\" or unfairly denied a victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where his or her coach, as well as one or more \"seconds\" may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signalled end of each round.\n\nA bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to \"go the distance\". The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knock-out; such bouts are said to have ended \"inside the distance\". If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue. Some jurisdictions [[Mandatory eight count|require the referee to count to eight]] regardless of if the fighter gets up before.\n\nShould the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled \"knocked out\" (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by [[knockout]] (KO). A \"technical knock-out\" (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a \"three-knockdown rule\", in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A \"standing eight\" count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he or she feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if he or she is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.\n\n[[File:Ingemar Johansson and Floyd Pattersson 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[Ingemar Johansson]] of Sweden KO's heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]], 26 June 1959.]]\n\nIn general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting. The boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the head or neck (called a \"rabbit-punch\") or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between).\n\nIf a \"clinch\" \u2013 a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause \u2013 is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to \"punch out\" of the clinch). When a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue.\n\nViolations of these rules may be ruled \"fouls\" by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. A fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a \"no contest\" result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed.\n\nUnheard of in the modern era, but common during the early 20th Century in North America, a \"newspaper decision (NWS)\" might be made after a no decision bout had ended. A \"no decision\" bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion and there was no knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. Officially, however, a \"no decision\" bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only. Often, media outlets covering a match will personally score the match, and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report.\n\n==Professional vs. amateur boxing==\n[[File:Prvoslav Vuj\u010di\u0107 and Roberto Dur\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|left|[[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] (right) held world championships in four weight classes: lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight and middleweight]]\nThroughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by [[money]], as the fighters competed for [[prize money]], promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result.\n\nThe modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/headgear-protects-boxers-brains-120208.htm|title=Headgear Protects Boxers' Brains, Mostly|last=Emspak|first=Jesse|date=February 8, 2012|work=DNews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423025636/http://news.discovery.com/tech/headgear-protects-boxers-brains-120208.htm|archive-date=April 23, 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an [[Automated Boxing Scoring System]], which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators. Professional boxing remains by far the most popular form of the sport globally, though amateur boxing is dominant in Cuba and some former Soviet republics. For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career. Western boxers typically participate in one Olympics and then turn pro, Cubans and other socialist countries have an opportunity to collect multiple medals.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/northern-ireland/19153615|title=Barry McGuigan explains Cuban boxing success|date=18 April 2013|via=www.bbc.com}}</ref> In 2016, professional boxers were admitted in the [[Boxing at the Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]] and other tournaments sanctioned by [[International Boxing Association (amateur)|AIBA]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2016/jun/01/professional-boxers-allowed-compete-at-rio-olympics|title=Professional boxers will be allowed to compete at Rio Olympics|work=The Guardian}}</ref> This was done in part to level the playing field and give all of the athletes the same opportunities government-sponsored boxers from socialist countries and post-Soviet republics have.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thesweetscience.com/feature-articles/46924-president-john-brown-wrecking-ball|title=Feisty USA Boxing President John Brown Sees Better Times Ahead|work=The Sweet Science}}</ref> However, [[List of boxing organisations#Professional organisations|professional organizations]] strongly opposed that decision.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/wbc-forbids-its-champions-and-ranked-fighters-from-going-to-olympics/|title=WBC forbids its champions and ranked fighters from going to Olympics|work=boxingnewsonline.net|access-date=21 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171222052210/http://www.boxingnewsonline.net/wbc-forbids-its-champions-and-ranked-fighters-from-going-to-olympics/|archive-date=22 December 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://mobile.nytimes.com/2016/08/16/sports/olympics/pro-boxers-at-the-olympics.html|title=Pro Boxers at the Olympics: An Opportunity, or a Dangerous Power Grab?}}</ref>\n\n===Amateur boxing===\n{{Main|Amateur boxing}}\n[[File:Nicola adams crop.PNG|thumb|upright=1.45|[[Nicola Adams]] is the first female boxer to win an Olympic gold medal. Here with [[Mary Kom]] of India.]]\n\nAmateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level, at the [[Olympic Games]] and [[Commonwealth Games]], and in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.\n\nCompetitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end is just a way to make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless the fighters weigh under {{convert|165|lb}}, thus allowing them to wear ten ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches \u2013 any boxer repeatedly landing low blows [[below the belt]] is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxing.about.com/od/amateurs/a/oly_rules.htm |title=Andrew Eisele (2005).

There are also some two-<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=329616 |title=BoxRec Boxing Records |publisher=Boxrec.com |date= |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> and three-round professional bouts,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxrec.com/show_display.php?show_id=521719 |title=BoxRec Boxing Records |publisher=Boxrec.com |date=25 February 2007 |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> especially in Australia. Through the early 20th century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit, benefiting high-energy fighters like [[Jack Dempsey]]. Fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights for most of the 20th century until the [[Boxing in the 1980s|early 1980s]], when the death of boxer [[Kim Duk-koo]] eventually prompted the [[World Boxing Council]] and other organizations sanctioning professional boxing to reduce the limit to twelve rounds.\n\nHeadgear is not permitted in professional bouts, and boxers are generally allowed to take much more damage before a fight is halted. At any time, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury. In that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. For this reason, fighters often employ [[cutman|cutmen]], whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. If a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare-chested.<ref>Bert Randolph Sugar (2001). \"Boxing\", World Book Online Americas Edition [http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm Owingsmillsboxingclub.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619215358/http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm |date=19 June 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Boxing styles==\n\n===Definition of style===\n\"Style\" is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout. No two fighters' styles are alike, as each is determined by that individual's physical and mental attributes. Three main styles exist in boxing: '''outside fighter''' (\"boxer\"), '''brawler''' (or \"slugger\"), and '''Inside fighter''' (\"swarmer\"). These styles may be divided into several special subgroups, such as counter puncher, etc. The main philosophy of the styles is, that each style has an advantage over one, but disadvantage over the other one. It follows the [[rock paper scissors]] scenario - boxer beats brawler, brawler beats swarmer, and swarmer beats boxer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingtrainingfitness.com/strategy/the-science-of-boxing-styles.html |title=The Science of Boxing Styles |publisher=Boxing Training Fitness |accessdate=4 December 2012 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112045101/http://www.boxingtrainingfitness.com/strategy/the-science-of-boxing-styles.html |archivedate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\n====Boxer/out-fighter====\n[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]] was a typical example of an out-fighter.]]\n\nA classic \"boxer\" or stylist (also known as an \"out-fighter\") seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down. Due to this reliance on weaker punches, out-fighters tend to win by point decisions rather than by knockout, though some out-fighters have notable knockout records. They are often regarded as the best boxing strategists due to their ability to control the pace of the fight and lead their opponent, methodically wearing him down and exhibiting more skill and finesse than a brawler.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxingbeginners.com/how_to_box_styles.php|title=Learn about the different boxing styles.

This style was also used by fictional boxer [[Apollo Creed]].\n\n=====Boxer-puncher=====\nA boxer-puncher is a well-rounded boxer who is able to fight at close range with a combination of technique and power, often with the ability to knock opponents out with a combination and in some instances a single shot. Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing.com/the_15_greatest_composite_punchers_of_all_time.html|title=The 15 Greatest Composite Punchers of All Time |website=Boxing.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.\n\nNotable boxer-punchers include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Canelo \u00c1lvarez]], [[Wladimir Klitschko]], [[Vasyl Lomachenko]], [[Lennox Lewis]], [[Joe Louis]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.337</ref> [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Oscar De La Hoya]], [[Archie Moore]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Nonito Donaire]], [[Sam Langford]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.120</ref> [[Henry Armstrong]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, Joe Frazier, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.204</ref> [[Sugar Ray Robinson]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.403</ref> [[Tony Zale]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.353,</ref> [[Alexis Arg\u00fcello]], [[Erik Morales]], [[Terry Norris]], [[Marco Antonio Barrera]], [[Naseem Hamed]], [[Thomas Hearns]], [[Julian Jackson (boxer)|Julian Jackson]] and [[Gennady Golovkin]].\n\n=====Counter puncher=====\n[[Counterpunch (boxing)|Counter punchers]] are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing one's attacks. To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.\n\nNotable counter punchers include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Joe Calzaghe]], [[Vitali Klitschko]], [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Max Schmeling]], [[Chris Byrd]], [[James J Corbett|Jim Corbett]], [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], [[Bernard Hopkins]], [[Laszlo Papp]], [[Jerry Quarry]], [[Anselmo Moreno]], [[James Toney]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez]], [[Humberto Soto]], [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], [[Roger Mayweather]], [[Pernell Whitaker]], [[Sergio Gabriel Martinez]] and [[Guillermo Rigondeaux]]. This style of boxing is also used by fictional boxer [[Little Mac (Punch-Out!!)|Little Mac]].\n\nCounter punchers usually wear their opponents down by causing them to miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try to stay away from the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.\n\n====Brawler/slugger====\n[[File:George Foreman 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Famous brawler [[George Foreman]]]]\nA brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but makes up for it through sheer punching power. Many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. However, not all brawler/slugger fighters are not mobile; some can move around and switch styles if needed but still have the brawler/slugger style such as [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Prince Naseem Hamed]] and [[Danny Garc\u00eda]].\n\nA brawler's most important assets are power and chin (the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing). Examples of this style include [[George Foreman]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Sonny Liston]], [[John L Sullivan|John L. Sullivan]], [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[Prince Naseem Hamed]], [[Ray Mancini]], [[David Tua]], [[Arturo Gatti]], [[Micky Ward]], [[Brandon R\u00edos]], [[Ruslan Provodnikov]], [[Michael Katsidis]], [[James Kirkland (boxer)|James Kirkland]], [[Marcos Maidana]], [[Jake LaMotta]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], and Ireland's [[John Duddy]]. This style of boxing was also used by [[fiction]]al boxers Rocky Balboa and James \"Clubber\" Lang.\n\nBrawlers tend to be more predictable and easy to hit but usually fare well enough against other fighting styles because they train to take punches very well. They often have a higher chance than other fighting styles to score a knockout against their opponents because they focus on landing big, powerful hits, instead of smaller, faster attacks. Oftentimes they place focus on training on their upper body instead of their entire body, to increase power and endurance. They also aim to intimidate their opponents because of their power, stature and ability to take a punch.\n\n====Swarmer/in-fighter====\n[[File:Henry Armstrong 1937.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Armstrong]] was known for his aggressive, non-stop assault style of fighting.]]\nIn-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called \"pressure fighters\") attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of [[Hook (boxing)|hooks]] and uppercuts. Mainly [[Mexican people|Mexican]], Irish, [[Irish-American]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], and [[Mexican-American]] boxers popularized this style. A successful in-fighter often needs a good \"[[chin (boxing)|chin]]\" because swarming usually involves being hit with many [[jab]]s before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward. However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting.\n\nThe essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression. Many short in-fighters use their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, this permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter. A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts, they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; [[Mike Tyson]] was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts. [[Marvin Hagler]] was known for his hard \"[[chin (boxing)|chin]]\", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents. Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit. The key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving.\n\nNotable in-fighters include [[Henry Armstrong]], [[Aaron Pryor]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Shawn Porter]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Rocky Marciano]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.75</ref> [[Wayne McCullough]], [[Gerry Penalosa]], [[Harry Greb]],<ref>James Roberts, Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.98, 99</ref><ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.339, 340</ref> [[David Tua]], [[James Toney]] and [[Ricky Hatton]]. This style was also used by the ''Street Fighter'' character [[Balrog (Street Fighter)|Balrog]].\n\n===Combinations of styles===\nAll fighters have primary skills with which they feel most comfortable, but truly elite fighters are often able to incorporate auxiliary styles when presented with a particular challenge. For example, an out-fighter will sometimes plant his feet and counter punch, or a slugger may have the stamina to pressure fight with his power punches.\n\nOld history of the development of boxing and its prevalence contribute to fusion of various types of martial arts and the emergence of new ones that are based on them. For example, a combination of boxing and sportive sambo techniques gave rise to a combat sambo.\n\n===Style matchups===\n[[File:Joe Louis - Max Schmeling - 1936.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Louis|Louis]] vs. [[Max Schmeling|Schmeling]], 1936]]\n\nThere is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others. In general, an in-fighter has an advantage over an out-fighter, an out-fighter has an advantage over a brawler, and a brawler has an advantage over an in-fighter; these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one, and weaker relative to another, with none dominating, as in [[rock paper scissors]]. Naturally, many other factors, such as the skill level and training of the combatants, determine the outcome of a fight, but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the clich\u00e9 amongst boxing fans and writers that \"styles make fights.\"\n\nBrawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in-fighters because, in trying to get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former has a very good chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day. A famous example of this type of match-up advantage would be [[George Foreman]]'s knockout victory over [[Joe Frazier]] in their original bout \"The Sunshine Showdown\".\n\nAlthough in-fighters struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance between themselves and the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] in their three fights. [[Joe Louis]], after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ [[Rocky Marciano]] would have caused him style problems even in his prime.\n\nThe boxer or out-fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.\n\nAn example of a style matchup was the historical fight of [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], a swarmer or in-fighter, against [[Meldrick Taylor]], the boxer or out-fighter (see [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez vs. Meldrick Taylor]]). The match was nicknamed \"Thunder Meets Lightning\" as an allusion to punching power of Ch\u00e1vez and blinding speed of Taylor. Ch\u00e1vez was the epitome of the \"Mexican\" style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Ch\u00e1vez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Ch\u00e1vez slowly punished Taylor. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Ch\u00e1vez, which only gave Ch\u00e1vez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. Ch\u00e1vez would have to knock Taylor out to claim a victory, whereas Taylor merely needed to stay away from the Mexican legend. However, Taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with Ch\u00e1vez. As he did so, Taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought Taylor closer to victory unless Ch\u00e1vez could knock him out.\nWith about a minute left in the round, Ch\u00e1vez hit Taylor squarely with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Ch\u00e1vez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Ch\u00e1vez back ahead of him. Suddenly Ch\u00e1vez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Ch\u00e1vez' desperate final flurry. Ch\u00e1vez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Ch\u00e1vez with only two seconds to go in the bout.\n\n==Equipment==\nSince boxing involves forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must be taken to prevent [[Boxer's fracture|damage to bones in the hand]]. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without [[wrist wraps]] and [[boxing gloves]]. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not use them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place.\n\nA [[mouthguard]] is important to protect the teeth and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts.\n\nBoxers practice their skills on several types of punching bags. A small, tear-drop-shaped \"speed bag\" is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills, while a large cylindrical \"heavy bag\" filled with sand, a synthetic substitute, or water is used to practice power punching and body blows. The double-end bag is usually connected by elastic on the top and bottom and moves randomly upon getting struck and helps the fighter work on accuracy and reflexes. In addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment, boxers also use sport-nonspecific training equipment to build strength, speed, agility, and stamina. Common training equipment includes free weights, rowing machines, [[jump rope]], and [[medicine balls]].\n\nBoxers also use punch/focus mitts in which a trainer calls out certain combinations and the fighter strikes the mitts accordingly. This is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. In addition, they also allow trainers to make boxers utilize footwork and distances more accurately.\n\nBoxing matches typically take place in a [[boxing ring]], a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term \"ring\" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general.\n\n==Technique==\n{{main|Boxing styles and technique}}\n\n===Stance===\nThe modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:attitude_droite1.jpg|''Upright stance''\nFile:attitude_semi-enroul\u00e9e1.jpg|''Semi-crouch''\nFile:attitude_enroul\u00e9e1.jpg|''Full crouch''\n</gallery>\n\nIn a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a half-step in front of the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the \"textbook\" stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents. In order to retain their stance boxers take 'the first step in any direction with the foot already leading in that direction.'<ref>Dempsey, Jack, 'Footwork' in ''Championship Fighting Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense'', 1950</ref>\n\nDifferent stances allow for bodyweight to be differently positioned and emphasised; this may in turn alter how powerfully and explosively a type of punch can be delivered. For instance, a crouched stance allows for the bodyweight to be positioned further forward over the lead left leg. If a lead left hook is thrown from this position, it will produce a powerful springing action in the lead leg and produce a more explosive punch. This springing action could not be generated effectively, for this punch, if an upright stance was used or if the bodyweight was positioned predominantly over the back leg.<ref>Dempsey, Jack, 'Stance' in ''Championship Fighting Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense'', 1950</ref> [[Mike Tyson]] was a keen practitioner of a crouched stance and this style of power punching. The preparatory positioning of the bodyweight over the bent lead leg is also known as an [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometric preload]].\n\nLeft-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The [[southpaw stance]], conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand.\n\nNorth American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots.\n\n===Punches===\nThere are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch other than a jab is considered a power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the following discussion will assume a right-handed boxer.\n<gallery widths=\"105\">\nFile:jab7.jpg|''[[Jab]]''\nFile:Drop3.jpg|''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]] '' - in counter-punch with a looping\nFile:crochet1.jpg|''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''\nFile:uppercut2.jpg|''[[Uppercut]]''\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Jab]]''' \u2013 A quick, straight punch thrown with the lead hand from the guard position. The jab extends from the side of the torso and typically does not pass in front of it. It is accompanied by a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips, while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. As the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin. The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw. After making contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face.\n** The jab is recognized as the most important punch in a boxer's arsenal because it provides a fair amount of its own cover and it leaves the least amount of space for a counter punch from the opponent. It has the longest reach of any punch and does not require commitment or large weight transfers. Due to its relatively weak power, the jab is often used as a tool to gauge distances, probe an opponent's defenses, harass an opponent, and set up heavier, more powerful punches. A half-step may be added, moving the entire body into the punch, for additional power. Some notable boxers who have been able to develop relative power in their jabs and use it to punish or wear down their opponents to some effect include [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko]].\n* '''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]]''' \u2013 A powerful, straight punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing the body and traveling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching the outside of the chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is thrown. A measure of an ideally extended cross is that the shoulder of the striking arm, the knee of the front leg and the ball of the front foot are on the same vertical plane.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Boxing for Fitness: Straight Right|url=http://nwfighting.com/fitnessboxing.html|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n** Weight is also transferred from the rear foot to the lead foot, resulting in the rear heel turning outwards as it acts as a fulcrum for the transfer of weight. Body rotation and the sudden weight transfer give the cross its power. Like the jab, a half-step forward may be added. After the cross is thrown, the hand is retracted quickly and the guard position resumed. It can be used to counter punch a jab, aiming for the opponent's head (or a counter to a cross aimed at the body) or to set up a hook. The cross is also called a \"straight\" or \"right\", especially if it does not cross the opponent's outstretched jab.\n* '''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''' \u2013 A semi-circular punch thrown with the lead hand to the side of the opponent's head. From the guard position, the elbow is drawn back with a horizontal fist (palm facing down) though in modern times a wide percentage of fighters throw the hook with a vertical fist (palm facing themselves). The rear hand is tucked firmly against the jaw to protect the chin. The torso and hips are rotated clockwise, propelling the fist through a tight, clockwise arc across the front of the body and connecting with the target.\n** At the same time, the lead foot pivots clockwise, turning the left heel outwards. Upon contact, the hook's circular path ends abruptly and the lead hand is pulled quickly back into the guard position. A hook may also target the lower body and this technique is sometimes called the \"rip\" to distinguish it from the conventional hook to the head. The hook may also be thrown with the rear hand. Notable left hookers include [[Joe Frazier]], [[Roy Jones, Jr.|Roy Jones Jr.]] and [[Mike Tyson]].\n[[File:Boxing080905 photoshop.jpg|thumb|[[Ricardo Dominguez]] (''left'') throws an [[uppercut]] on [[Rafael Ortiz]] (''right'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Herbert G.|title=Boxing: A Worldwide Record of Bouts and Boxers|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=NC, USA|isbn=978-0-7864-6054-0|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6054-0|access-date=20 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509012702/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6054-0|archive-date=9 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n* '''[[Uppercut]]''' \u2013 A vertical, rising punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the torso shifts slightly to the right, the rear hand drops below the level of the opponent's chest and the knees are bent slightly. From this position, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso.\n** At the same time, the knees push upwards quickly and the torso and hips rotate anti-clockwise and the rear heel turns outward, mimicking the body movement of the cross. The strategic utility of the uppercut depends on its ability to \"lift\" the opponent's body, setting it off-balance for successive attacks. The right uppercut followed by a left hook is a deadly combination employing the uppercut to lift the opponent's chin into a vulnerable position, then the hook to knock the opponent out.\n\nThese different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or \"combos.\" The most common is the jab and cross combination, nicknamed the \"one-two combo.\" This is usually an effective combination, because the jab blocks the opponent's view of the cross, making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully.\n\nA large, swinging circular punch starting from a cocked-back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter's weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a \"roundhouse,\" \"haymaker,\" \"overhand,\" or sucker-punch. Relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc, the roundhouse can be a powerful blow, but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard.\n\nWide, looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation. Sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in.\n\nAnother unconventional punch is the rarely used [[bolo punch]], in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc, usually as a distraction, before delivering with either that or the other arm.\n\nAn illegal punch to the back of the head or neck is known as a [[rabbit punch]].\n\nBoth the hook and uppercut may be thrown with both hands, resulting in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand. Generally the analogous opposite is true of the footwork and torso movement.\n\n===Defense===\nThere are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below.\n<gallery widths=\"105\">\nFile:slip1.jpg|''[[Slipping]]''\nFile:slip2.jpg|''[[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]]''\nFile:blocage1.jpg|''[[Blocking (martial arts)|Blocking]] (with the arms)''\nFile:protection passive1.jpg|''[[Covering (martial arts)|Cover-Up]] (with the gloves)''\nFile:neutraliser1.jpg|''[[Clinch fighting|Clinching]]''\nFile:pas de retrait.jpg|''[[Footwork (martial arts)|Footwork]]''\nFile:retrait2.jpg|''Pulling away''\n</gallery>\n* '''Slip''' \u2013 [[Slipping]] rotates the body slightly so that an incoming punch passes harmlessly next to the head. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer sharply rotates the hips and shoulders. This turns the chin sideways and allows the punch to \"slip\" past. [[Muhammad Ali]] was famous for extremely fast and close slips, as was an early [[Mike Tyson]].\n* '''Sway or fade''' \u2013 To anticipate a punch and move the upper body or head back so that it misses or has its force appreciably lessened. Also called \"rolling with the punch\" or \" Riding The Punch\".\n* '''Duck''' or '''break''' \u2013 To drop down with the back straight so that a punch aimed at the head glances or misses entirely.\n* '''Bob and weave''' \u2013 [[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]] moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Once the punch has been evaded, the boxer \"weaves\" back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent's still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the outside\". To move inside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the inside\". Joe Frazier, Jack Dempsey, Mike Tyson and Rocky Marciano were masters of bobbing and weaving.\n* '''Parry/block''' \u2013 [[Parrying]] or [[Blocking (martial arts)|blocking]] uses the boxer's shoulder, hands or arms as defensive tools to protect against incoming attacks. A block generally receives a punch while a parry tends to deflect it. A \"palm\", \"catch\", or \"cuff\" is a defence which intentionally takes the incoming punch on the palm portion of the defender's glove.\n* '''The cover-up''' \u2013 Covering up is the last opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches \"roll\" off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.\n* The '''[[grappling position#Stand-up positions|clinch]]''' \u2013 Clinching is a form of [[Trapping (martial arts)|trapping]] or a rough form of [[grappling]] and occurs when the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed. In this situation, the boxer attempts to [[grappling hold|hold]] or \"tie up\" the opponent's hands so he is unable to throw hooks or [[uppercut]]s. To perform a clinch, the boxer loops both hands around the outside of the opponent's shoulders, scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent's arms tightly against his own body. In this position, the opponent's arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack. [[Clinching position|Clinching]] is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee. Clinching is technically against the rules, and in amateur fights points are deducted fairly quickly for it. It is unlikely, however, to see points deducted for a clinch in professional boxing.\n\n===Unorthodox strategies===\n* '''The \"[[rope-a-dope]]\" strategy''': Used by Muhammad Ali in his 1974 \"[[the Rumble in the Jungle]]\" bout against George Foreman, the rope-a-dope method involves lying back against the ropes, covering up defensively as much as possible and allowing the opponent to attempt numerous punches. The back-leaning posture, which does not cause the defending boxer to become as unbalanced as he would during normal backward movement, also maximizes the distance of the defender's head from his opponent, increasing the probability that punches will miss their intended target. Weathering the blows that do land, the defender lures the opponent into expending energy while conserving his/her own. If successful, the attacking opponent will eventually tire, creating defensive flaws which the boxer can exploit. In modern boxing, the rope-a-dope is generally discouraged since most opponents are not fooled by it and few boxers possess the physical toughness to withstand a prolonged, unanswered assault. Recently, however, [[Octuple champion|eight-division world champion]] [[Manny Pacquiao]] skillfully used the strategy to gauge the power of welterweight titlist [[Miguel Cotto]] in November 2009. Pacquiao followed up the rope-a-dope gambit with a withering knockdown. [[Tyson Fury]] also attempted this against Francesco Pianeto but didn't pull it off as smoothly.\n* '''[[Bolo punch]]''': Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which owes its power to the shortening of a [[circular arc]] rather than to transference of body weight; it tends to have more of an effect due to the surprise of the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power of the punch. This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the [[Muhammad Ali|Ali shuffle]]. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former [[welterweight]] champions [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], and [[Kid Gavil\u00e1n]] as well as current British fighter [[Chris Eubank Jr.|Chris Eubank Jr]]. Middleweight champion [[Ceferino Garcia]] is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.\n<gallery>\nFile:contre_bolo1.jpg| ''[[Bolo punch]]''\nFile:drop1.jpg| ''[[overhand (boxing)|Overhand (overcut)]]''\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Drop (boxing)|Overhand]]''': The overhand is a punch, thrown from the rear hand, not found in every boxer's arsenal. Unlike the cross, which has a trajectory parallel to the ground, the overhand has a looping circular arc as it is thrown over the shoulder with the palm facing away from the boxer. It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents. Boxers who have used this punch consistently and effectively include former heavyweight champions [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Tim Witherspoon]], as well as MMA champions [[Chuck Liddell]] and [[Fedor Emelianenko]]. The overhand has become a popular weapon in other tournaments that involve fist striking. [[Deontay Wilder]] heavily favours and is otherwise known for knocking many of his opponents out with one of his right overhands.\n* '''[[Check hook]]''': A check hook is employed to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part consists of a regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking it has been said that there is no such thing as a check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past. Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport. [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] employed the use of a check hook against [[Ricky Hatton]], which sent Hatton flying head first into the corner post and being knocked down.\n\n==Ring corner==\n[[File:2017-12-02 Tina Rupprecht - Anne Sophie Da Costa - DSC2771.jpg|thumb|right|Female boxer [[Tina Rupprecht]] receiving instructions from her trainer while being treated by her cutman in the ring corner between rounds.]]\nIn boxing, each fighter is given a corner of the ring where he rests in between rounds for 1 minute and where his trainers stand. Typically, three men stand in the corner besides the boxer himself; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the [[cutman]]. The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what he is doing wrong as well as encouraging him if he is losing. The cutman is a cutaneous [[physician|doctor]] responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts, blood and excessive swelling. This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts or swelling that threaten the boxer's eyes.\n\nIn addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase \"to throw in the towel\", meaning to give up, derives from this practice).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/throw-in-the-towel.html |title=Phrases.org |publisher=Phrases.org |date= |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> This can be seen in the fight between [[Diego Corrales]] and [[Floyd Mayweather]]. In that fight, Corrales' corner surrendered despite Corrales' steadfast refusal.\n\n==Medical concerns==\n{{see also|Dementia pugilistica|The distance (boxing)#Distance change criticisms}}\nKnocking a person unconscious or even causing a [[concussion]] may cause permanent [[brain damage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/363957.stm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020918102719/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/363957.stm|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 September 2002|title=Boxing: The health risks|access-date=6 May 2010}}</ref> There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/4437|title=Better and Safer Boxing: Ringside and Boardroom Medical Control of Boxing Careers in the Twentieth Century|website=Dora.dmu.ac.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=June 2006|last1=Carter|first1=Neil}}</ref> From 1980 to 2007, more than 200 amateur boxers, professional boxers and [[Toughman Contest|Toughman]] fighters died due to ring or training injuries.<ref>Svinth, Joseph R.

The town, [[Canastota, New York]], (which is about {{convert|15|mi|km}} east of Syracuse, via the New York State Thruway), honored former world [[welterweight]]/[[middleweight]] champion [[Carmen Basilio]] and his nephew, former world welterweight champion [[Billy Backus]].

The first inductees in 1990 included Jack Johnson, [[Benny Leonard]], Jack Dempsey, Henry Armstrong, [[Sugar Ray Robinson]], [[Archie Moore]], and Muhammad Ali.

In Olympic terms, it was first introduced in the 23rd [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympiad]], 688 BC. The boxers would wind leather thongs around their hands in order to protect them. There were no rounds and boxers fought until one of them acknowledged defeat or could not continue. Weight categories were not used, which meant heavyweights had a tendency to dominate. The style of boxing practiced typically featured an advanced left leg stance, with the left arm semi-extended as a guard, in addition to being used for striking, and with the right arm drawn back ready to strike. It was the head of the opponent which was primarily targeted, and there is little evidence to suggest that targeting the body was common.<ref>Gardiner, E. Norman, 'Boxing' in ''Greek Athletic Sports and Festivals'', London:MacMillan, 1910, p.402, pp.415-416, 419-422</ref>\n\nBoxing was a popular spectator [[sport]] in [[Ancient Rome]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Sports Spectators from Antiquity to the Renaissance|last1=Guttmann|first1=Allen|year=1981|volume=8|issue=2|journal=Journal of Sport History|url=http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1981/JSH0802/jsh0802b.pdf|access-date=11 November 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822123753/http://library.la84.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH1981/JSH0802/jsh0802b.pdf|archive-date=22 August 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> In order for the fighters to protect themselves against their opponents they wrapped [[leather]] thongs around their fists. Eventually harder leather was used and the thong soon became a [[weapon]]. The Romans even introduced metal studs to the thongs to make the [[cestus]]. Fighting events were held at Roman [[Amphitheatres]]. The Roman form of boxing was often a fight until death to please the spectators who gathered at such events. However, especially in later times, purchased slaves and trained combat performers were valuable commodities, and their lives were not given up without due consideration. Often slaves were used against one another in a circle marked on the floor. This is where the term ring came from. In AD 393, during the Roman [[gladiator]] period, boxing was abolished due to excessive brutality. It was not until the late 16th century that boxing re-surfaced in London.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\n===Early London prize ring rules===\n[[File:Blow2.jpg|thumb|left|A straight right demonstrated in Edmund Price's ''The Science of Defence: A Treatise on Sparring and Wrestling'', 1867]]\n\nRecords of Classical boxing activity disappeared after the fall of the Western [[Roman Empire]] when the wearing of weapons became common once again and interest in fighting with the fists waned. However, there are detailed records of various fist-fighting [[sports]] that were maintained in different cities and provinces of Italy between the 12th and 17th centuries. There was also a sport in [[ancient Rus]] called [[Russian fist fighting|Kulachniy Boy]] or \"Fist Fighting\".\n\nAs the wearing of swords became less common, there was renewed interest in fencing with the fists. The sport would later resurface in England during the early 16th century in the form of [[bare-knuckle boxing]] sometimes referred to as '''prizefighting'''. The first documented account of a bare-knuckle fight in England appeared in 1681 in the ''London Protestant Mercury'', and the first English bare-knuckle champion was [[James Figg]] in 1719.<ref name=\"Roberts-1999\">{{cite web |title=James Figg |url=http://www.ibhof.com/pages/about/inductees/pioneer/figg.html |date=1999 |publisher=[[IBHOF]] |accessdate=2018-03-22}} excerpting {{cite book |last1=Roberts |first1=James B. |last2=Skutt |first2=Alexander G. |title=The Boxing Register: International Boxing Hall of Fame Official Record Book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aA2LO_DGdu4C |pages= |accessdate=22 March 2018 |edition=4th |year=2006 |publisher=McBooks Press |location=Ithaca, N.Y. |isbn=978-1-59013-121-3|oclc=819715339}}</ref> This is also the time when the word \"boxing\" first came to be used. This earliest form of modern boxing was very different. Contests in Mr. Figg's time, in addition to fist fighting, also contained fencing and cudgeling. On 6 January 1681, the first recorded boxing match took place in Britain when [[Christopher Monck]], 2nd [[Duke of Albemarle]] (and later [[Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica]]) engineered a bout between his butler and his butcher with the latter winning the prize.\n\nEarly fighting had no written rules. There were no weight divisions or round limits, and no referee. In general, it was extremely chaotic. An early article on boxing was published in Nottingham, 1713, by [[Parkyns baronets|Sir Thomas Parkyns]], a successful Wrestler from [[Bunny, Nottinghamshire]], who had practised the techniques he described. The article, a single page in his manual of wrestling and fencing, ''Progymnasmata: The inn-play, or Cornish-hugg wrestler'', described a system of headbutting, punching, eye-gouging, chokes, and hard throws, not recognized in boxing today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_lx13m7QVfb1qa5yan.jpg |title=tumblr_lx13m7QVfb1qa5yan.jpg |publisher=Tumblr |date= |accessdate=16 January 2014}}</ref>\n\nThe first boxing rules, called the Broughton's rules, were introduced by champion [[Jack Broughton]] in 1743 to protect fighters in the ring where deaths sometimes occurred.<ref>[http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm John Rennie (2006) ''East London Prize Ring Rules 1743''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218094646/http://www.eastlondonhistory.com/broughton%20jack.htm |date=18 February 2008 }}</ref> Under these rules, if a man went down and could not continue after a count of 30 seconds, the fight was over. Hitting a downed fighter and grasping below the waist were prohibited. Broughton encouraged the use of 'mufflers', a form of padded bandage or mitten, to be used in 'jousting' or sparring sessions in training, and in exhibition matches.\n\n[[File:Cribb vs Molineaux 1811.jpg|thumb|[[Tom Cribb]] vs [[Tom Molineaux]] in a re-match for the heavyweight championship of England, 1811]]\nThese rules did allow the fighters an advantage not enjoyed by today's boxers; they permitted the fighter to drop to one knee to end the round and begin the 30-second count at any time. Thus a fighter realizing he was in trouble had an opportunity to recover. However, this was considered \"unmanly\"<ref>Anonymous (\"A Celebrated Pugilist\"), The Art and Practice of Boxing, 1825</ref> and was frequently disallowed by additional rules negotiated by the Seconds of the Boxers.<ref>Daniel Mendoza, The Modern Art of Boxing, 1790</ref> In modern boxing, there is a three-minute limit to rounds (unlike the downed fighter ends the round rule). Intentionally going down in modern boxing will cause the recovering fighter to lose points in the scoring system. Furthermore, as the contestants did not have heavy leather gloves and wristwraps to protect their hands, they used different punching technique to preserve their hands because the head was a common target to hit full out.{{dubious|date=August 2018}}{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Almost all period manuals have powerful straight punches with the whole body behind them to the face (including forehead) as the basic blows.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/8388742/sn/1178659240/name/blow-1.jpg |title=blow-1.jpg |publisher=Yahoo! |accessdate=16 January 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141024213415/http://xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/8388742/sn/1178659240/name/blow-1.jpg |archive-date=24 October 2014 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/group/classicpugilism/photos/album/1501552404/pic/1874370929/view?picmode=&mode=tn&order=ordinal&start=1&count=20&dir=asc |title=Yahoo!

Rounds were three minutes with one-minute rest intervals between rounds. Each fighter was given a ten-second count if he was knocked down, and wrestling was banned.\nThe introduction of [[boxing gloves|gloves]] of \"fair-size\" also changed the nature of the bouts. An average pair of boxing gloves resembles a bloated pair of mittens and are laced up around the wrists.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/Marquess-of-Queensberry-rules |title=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica (2006).

As a result of their introduction, bouts became longer and more strategic with greater importance attached to defensive maneuvers such as slipping, bobbing, countering and angling. Because less defensive emphasis was placed on the use of the forearms and more on the gloves, the classical forearms outwards, torso leaning back stance of the bare knuckle boxer was modified to a more modern stance in which the torso is tilted forward and the hands are held closer to the face.\n\n===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===\nThrough the late nineteenth century, the martial art of boxing or prizefighting was primarily a sport of dubious legitimacy.

A majority of young talent still comes from poverty-stricken areas around the world. Places like Mexico, Africa, South America, and Eastern Europe prove to be filled with young aspiring athletes who wish to become the future of boxing. Even in the U.S., places like the inner cities of New York, and Chicago have given rise to promising young talent. According to Rubin, \"boxing lost its appeal with the American middle class, and most of who boxes in modern America come from the streets and are street fighters\".<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rubin|first=Louis D.|date=2000|title=The Manly art of Modified Mayhem: Dempsey and Others|jstor=27548887|journal=The Sewanee Review|volume=108|issue=3|pages=412\u2013432}}</ref>\n\n==Rules==\n{{main|Marquess of Queensberry Rules}}\nThe ''[[Marquess of Queensberry rules]]'' have been the general rules governing modern boxing since their publication in 1867.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/sports/Marquess-of-Queensberry-rules|title=Marquess of Queensberry rules {{!}} boxing|encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-08}}</ref>\n\nA boxing match typically consists of a determined number of three-minute rounds, a total of up to 9 to 12 rounds. A minute is typically spent between each round with the fighters in their assigned corners receiving advice and attention from their coach and staff. The fight is controlled by a referee who works within the ring to judge and control the conduct of the fighters, rule on their ability to fight safely, count knocked-down fighters, and rule on fouls.\n\nUp to three judges are typically present at ringside to score the bout and assign points to the boxers, based on punches and elbows that connect, defense, knockdowns, hugging and other, more subjective, measures. Because of the open-ended style of boxing judging, many fights have controversial results, in which one or both fighters believe they have been \"robbed\" or unfairly denied a victory. Each fighter has an assigned corner of the ring, where his or her coach, as well as one or more \"seconds\" may administer to the fighter at the beginning of the fight and between rounds. Each boxer enters into the ring from their assigned corners at the beginning of each round and must cease fighting and return to their corner at the signalled end of each round.\n\nA bout in which the predetermined number of rounds passes is decided by the judges, and is said to \"go the distance\". The fighter with the higher score at the end of the fight is ruled the winner. With three judges, unanimous and split decisions are possible, as are draws. A boxer may win the bout before a decision is reached through a knock-out; such bouts are said to have ended \"inside the distance\". If a fighter is knocked down during the fight, determined by whether the boxer touches the canvas floor of the ring with any part of their body other than the feet as a result of the opponent's punch and not a slip, as determined by the referee, the referee begins counting until the fighter returns to his or her feet and can continue. Some jurisdictions [[Mandatory eight count|require the referee to count to eight]] regardless of if the fighter gets up before.\n\nShould the referee count to ten, then the knocked-down boxer is ruled \"knocked out\" (whether unconscious or not) and the other boxer is ruled the winner by [[knockout]] (KO). A \"technical knock-out\" (TKO) is possible as well, and is ruled by the referee, fight doctor, or a fighter's corner if a fighter is unable to safely continue to fight, based upon injuries or being judged unable to effectively defend themselves. Many jurisdictions and sanctioning agencies also have a \"three-knockdown rule\", in which three knockdowns in a given round result in a TKO. A TKO is considered a knockout in a fighter's record. A \"standing eight\" count rule may also be in effect. This gives the referee the right to step in and administer a count of eight to a fighter that he or she feels may be in danger, even if no knockdown has taken place. After counting the referee will observe the fighter, and decide if he or she is fit to continue. For scoring purposes, a standing eight count is treated as a knockdown.\n\n[[File:Ingemar Johansson and Floyd Pattersson 1959.JPG|right|thumb|[[Ingemar Johansson]] of Sweden KO's heavyweight champion [[Floyd Patterson]], 26 June 1959.]]\n\nIn general, boxers are prohibited from hitting below the belt, holding, tripping, pushing, biting, or spitting. The boxer's shorts are raised so the opponent is not allowed to hit to the groin area with intent to cause pain or injury. Failure to abide by the former may result in a foul. They also are prohibited from kicking, head-butting, or hitting with any part of the arm other than the knuckles of a closed fist (including hitting with the elbow, shoulder or forearm, as well as with open gloves, the wrist, the inside, back or side of the hand). They are prohibited as well from hitting the back, back of the head or neck (called a \"rabbit-punch\") or the kidneys. They are prohibited from holding the ropes for support when punching, holding an opponent while punching, or ducking below the belt of their opponent (dropping below the waist of your opponent, no matter the distance between).\n\nIf a \"clinch\" \u2013 a defensive move in which a boxer wraps his or her opponents arms and holds on to create a pause \u2013 is broken by the referee, each fighter must take a full step back before punching again (alternatively, the referee may direct the fighters to \"punch out\" of the clinch). When a boxer is knocked down, the other boxer must immediately cease fighting and move to the furthest neutral corner of the ring until the referee has either ruled a knockout or called for the fight to continue.\n\nViolations of these rules may be ruled \"fouls\" by the referee, who may issue warnings, deduct points, or disqualify an offending boxer, causing an automatic loss, depending on the seriousness and intentionality of the foul. An intentional foul that causes injury that prevents a fight from continuing usually causes the boxer who committed it to be disqualified. A fighter who suffers an accidental low-blow may be given up to five minutes to recover, after which they may be ruled knocked out if they are unable to continue. Accidental fouls that cause injury ending a bout may lead to a \"no contest\" result, or else cause the fight to go to a decision if enough rounds (typically four or more, or at least three in a four-round fight) have passed.\n\nUnheard of in the modern era, but common during the early 20th Century in North America, a \"newspaper decision (NWS)\" might be made after a no decision bout had ended. A \"no decision\" bout occurred when, by law or by pre-arrangement of the fighters, if both boxers were still standing at the fight's conclusion and there was no knockout, no official decision was rendered and neither boxer was declared the winner. But this did not prevent the pool of ringside newspaper reporters from declaring a consensus result among themselves and printing a newspaper decision in their publications. Officially, however, a \"no decision\" bout resulted in neither boxer winning or losing. Boxing historians sometimes use these unofficial newspaper decisions in compiling fight records for illustrative purposes only. Often, media outlets covering a match will personally score the match, and post their scores as an independent sentence in their report.\n\n==Professional vs. amateur boxing==\n[[File:Prvoslav Vuj\u010di\u0107 and Roberto Dur\u00e1n.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|left|[[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]] (right) held world championships in four weight classes: lightweight, welterweight, light middleweight and middleweight]]\nThroughout the 17th to 19th centuries, boxing bouts were motivated by [[money]], as the fighters competed for [[prize money]], promoters controlled the gate, and spectators bet on the result.\n\nThe modern Olympic movement revived interest in amateur sports, and amateur boxing became an Olympic sport in 1908. In their current form, Olympic and other amateur bouts are typically limited to three or four rounds, scoring is computed by points based on the number of clean blows landed, regardless of impact, and fighters wear protective headgear, reducing the number of injuries, knockdowns, and knockouts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/tech/headgear-protects-boxers-brains-120208.htm|title=Headgear Protects Boxers' Brains, Mostly|last=Emspak|first=Jesse|date=February 8, 2012|work=DNews|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423025636/http://news.discovery.com/tech/headgear-protects-boxers-brains-120208.htm|archive-date=April 23, 2016|url-status=dead|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> Currently scoring blows in amateur boxing are subjectively counted by ringside judges, but the Australian Institute for Sport has demonstrated a prototype of an [[Automated Boxing Scoring System]], which introduces scoring objectivity, improves safety, and arguably makes the sport more interesting to spectators.

For most fighters, an amateur career, especially at the Olympics, serves to develop skills and gain experience in preparation for a professional career.

Here with [[Mary Kom]] of India.]]\n\nAmateur boxing may be found at the collegiate level, at the [[Olympic Games]] and [[Commonwealth Games]], and in many other venues sanctioned by amateur boxing associations. Amateur boxing has a point scoring system that measures the number of clean blows landed rather than physical damage. Bouts consist of three rounds of three minutes in the Olympic and Commonwealth Games, and three rounds of three minutes in a national ABA (Amateur Boxing Association) bout, each with a one-minute interval between rounds.\n\nCompetitors wear protective headgear and gloves with a white strip or circle across the knuckle. There are cases however, where white ended gloves are not required but any solid color may be worn. The white end is just a way to make it easier for judges to score clean hits. Each competitor must have their hands properly wrapped, pre-fight, for added protection on their hands and for added cushion under the gloves. Gloves worn by the fighters must be twelve ounces in weight unless the fighters weigh under {{convert|165|lb}}, thus allowing them to wear ten ounce gloves. A punch is considered a scoring punch only when the boxers connect with the white portion of the gloves. Each punch that lands cleanly on the head or torso with sufficient force is awarded a point. A referee monitors the fight to ensure that competitors use only legal blows. A belt worn over the torso represents the lower limit of punches \u2013 any boxer repeatedly landing low blows [[below the belt]] is disqualified. Referees also ensure that the boxers don't use holding tactics to prevent the opponent from swinging. If this occurs, the referee separates the opponents and orders them to continue boxing. Repeated holding can result in a boxer being penalized or ultimately disqualified. Referees will stop the bout if a boxer is seriously injured, if one boxer is significantly dominating the other or if the score is severely imbalanced.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://boxing.about.com/od/amateurs/a/oly_rules.htm |title=Andrew Eisele (2005).

Through the early 20th century, it was common for fights to have unlimited rounds, ending only when one fighter quit, benefiting high-energy fighters like [[Jack Dempsey]]. Fifteen rounds remained the internationally recognized limit for championship fights for most of the 20th century until the [[Boxing in the 1980s|early 1980s]], when the death of boxer [[Kim Duk-koo]] eventually prompted the [[World Boxing Council]] and other organizations sanctioning professional boxing to reduce the limit to twelve rounds.\n\nHeadgear is not permitted in professional bouts, and boxers are generally allowed to take much more damage before a fight is halted. At any time, the referee may stop the contest if he believes that one participant cannot defend himself due to injury. In that case, the other participant is awarded a technical knockout win. A technical knockout would also be awarded if a fighter lands a punch that opens a cut on the opponent, and the opponent is later deemed not fit to continue by a doctor because of the cut. For this reason, fighters often employ [[cutman|cutmen]], whose job is to treat cuts between rounds so that the boxer is able to continue despite the cut. If a boxer simply quits fighting, or if his corner stops the fight, then the winning boxer is also awarded a technical knockout victory. In contrast with amateur boxing, professional male boxers have to be bare-chested.<ref>Bert Randolph Sugar (2001). \"Boxing\", World Book Online Americas Edition [http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm Owingsmillsboxingclub.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060619215358/http://www.owingsmillsboxingclub.com/boxing.htm |date=19 June 2006 }}</ref>\n\n==Boxing styles==\n\n===Definition of style===\n\"Style\" is often defined as the strategic approach a fighter takes during a bout. No two fighters' styles are alike, as each is determined by that individual's physical and mental attributes. Three main styles exist in boxing: '''outside fighter''' (\"boxer\"), '''brawler''' (or \"slugger\"), and '''Inside fighter''' (\"swarmer\"). These styles may be divided into several special subgroups, such as counter puncher, etc. The main philosophy of the styles is, that each style has an advantage over one, but disadvantage over the other one. It follows the [[rock paper scissors]] scenario - boxer beats brawler, brawler beats swarmer, and swarmer beats boxer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxingtrainingfitness.com/strategy/the-science-of-boxing-styles.html |title=The Science of Boxing Styles |publisher=Boxing Training Fitness |accessdate=4 December 2012 |url-status=dead  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112045101/http://www.boxingtrainingfitness.com/strategy/the-science-of-boxing-styles.html |archivedate=2012-01-12}}</ref>\n\n====Boxer/out-fighter====\n[[File:Muhammad Ali NYWTS.jpg|thumb|Heavyweight champion [[Muhammad Ali]] was a typical example of an out-fighter.]]\n\nA classic \"boxer\" or stylist (also known as an \"out-fighter\") seeks to maintain distance between himself and his opponent, fighting with faster, longer range punches, most notably the jab, and gradually wearing his opponent down.

Their movement and tactics are similar to that of an out-fighter (although they are generally not as mobile as an out-fighter),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxing.com/the_15_greatest_composite_punchers_of_all_time.html|title=The 15 Greatest Composite Punchers of All Time |website=Boxing.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}</ref> but instead of winning by decision, they tend to wear their opponents down using combinations and then move in to score the knockout. A boxer must be well rounded to be effective using this style.\n\nNotable boxer-punchers include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Canelo \u00c1lvarez]], [[Wladimir Klitschko]], [[Vasyl Lomachenko]], [[Lennox Lewis]], [[Joe Louis]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.337</ref> [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Oscar De La Hoya]], [[Archie Moore]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Nonito Donaire]], [[Sam Langford]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.120</ref> [[Henry Armstrong]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, Joe Frazier, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.204</ref> [[Sugar Ray Robinson]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.403</ref> [[Tony Zale]], [[Carlos Monz\u00f3n]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.353,</ref> [[Alexis Arg\u00fcello]], [[Erik Morales]], [[Terry Norris]], [[Marco Antonio Barrera]], [[Naseem Hamed]], [[Thomas Hearns]], [[Julian Jackson (boxer)|Julian Jackson]] and [[Gennady Golovkin]].\n\n=====Counter puncher=====\n[[Counterpunch (boxing)|Counter punchers]] are slippery, defensive style fighters who often rely on their opponent's mistakes in order to gain the advantage, whether it be on the score cards or more preferably a knockout. They use their well-rounded defense to avoid or block shots and then immediately catch the opponent off guard with a well placed and timed punch. A fight with a skilled counter-puncher can turn into a war of attrition, where each shot landed is a battle in itself. Thus, fighting against counter punchers requires constant feinting and the ability to avoid telegraphing one's attacks. To be truly successful using this style they must have good reflexes, a high level of prediction and awareness, pinpoint accuracy and speed, both in striking and in footwork.\n\nNotable counter punchers include [[Muhammad Ali]], [[Joe Calzaghe]], [[Vitali Klitschko]], [[Evander Holyfield]], [[Max Schmeling]], [[Chris Byrd]], [[James J Corbett|Jim Corbett]], [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]], [[Bernard Hopkins]], [[Laszlo Papp]], [[Jerry Quarry]], [[Anselmo Moreno]], [[James Toney]], [[Marvin Hagler]], [[Juan Manuel M\u00e1rquez]], [[Humberto Soto]], [[Floyd Mayweather Jr.]], [[Roger Mayweather]], [[Pernell Whitaker]], [[Sergio Gabriel Martinez]] and [[Guillermo Rigondeaux]]. This style of boxing is also used by fictional boxer [[Little Mac (Punch-Out!!)|Little Mac]].\n\nCounter punchers usually wear their opponents down by causing them to miss their punches. The more the opponent misses, the faster they tire, and the psychological effects of being unable to land a hit will start to sink in. The counter puncher often tries to outplay their opponent entirely, not just in a physical sense, but also in a mental and emotional sense. This style can be incredibly difficult, especially against seasoned fighters, but winning a fight without getting hit is often worth the pay-off. They usually try to stay away from the center of the ring, in order to outmaneuver and chip away at their opponents. A large advantage in counter-hitting is the forward momentum of the attacker, which drives them further into your return strike. As such, knockouts are more common than one would expect from a defensive style.\n\n====Brawler/slugger====\n[[File:George Foreman 2009.jpg|thumb|right|Famous brawler [[George Foreman]]]]\nA brawler is a fighter who generally lacks finesse and footwork in the ring, but makes up for it through sheer punching power. Many brawlers tend to lack mobility, preferring a less mobile, more stable platform and have difficulty pursuing fighters who are fast on their feet. They may also have a tendency to ignore combination punching in favor of continuous beat-downs with one hand and by throwing slower, more powerful single punches (such as hooks and uppercuts). Their slowness and predictable punching pattern (single punches with obvious leads) often leaves them open to counter punches, so successful brawlers must be able to absorb substantial amounts of punishment. However, not all brawler/slugger fighters are not mobile; some can move around and switch styles if needed but still have the brawler/slugger style such as [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Prince Naseem Hamed]] and [[Danny Garc\u00eda]].\n\nA brawler's most important assets are power and chin (the ability to absorb punishment while remaining able to continue boxing). Examples of this style include [[George Foreman]], [[Rocky Marciano]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Roberto Dur\u00e1n]], [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], [[Wilfredo G\u00f3mez]], [[Sonny Liston]], [[John L Sullivan|John L. Sullivan]], [[Max Baer (boxer)|Max Baer]], [[Prince Naseem Hamed]], [[Ray Mancini]], [[David Tua]], [[Arturo Gatti]], [[Micky Ward]], [[Brandon R\u00edos]], [[Ruslan Provodnikov]], [[Michael Katsidis]], [[James Kirkland (boxer)|James Kirkland]], [[Marcos Maidana]], [[Jake LaMotta]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], and Ireland's [[John Duddy]]. This style of boxing was also used by [[fiction]]al boxers Rocky Balboa and James \"Clubber\" Lang.\n\nBrawlers tend to be more predictable and easy to hit but usually fare well enough against other fighting styles because they train to take punches very well. They often have a higher chance than other fighting styles to score a knockout against their opponents because they focus on landing big, powerful hits, instead of smaller, faster attacks. Oftentimes they place focus on training on their upper body instead of their entire body, to increase power and endurance. They also aim to intimidate their opponents because of their power, stature and ability to take a punch.\n\n====Swarmer/in-fighter====\n[[File:Henry Armstrong 1937.jpg|thumb|right|[[Henry Armstrong]] was known for his aggressive, non-stop assault style of fighting.]]\nIn-fighters/swarmers (sometimes called \"pressure fighters\") attempt to stay close to an opponent, throwing intense flurries and combinations of [[Hook (boxing)|hooks]] and uppercuts. Mainly [[Mexican people|Mexican]], Irish, [[Irish-American]], [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]], and [[Mexican-American]] boxers popularized this style. A successful in-fighter often needs a good \"[[chin (boxing)|chin]]\" because swarming usually involves being hit with many [[jab]]s before they can maneuver inside where they are more effective. In-fighters operate best at close range because they are generally shorter and have less reach than their opponents and thus are more effective at a short distance where the longer arms of their opponents make punching awkward. However, several fighters tall for their division have been relatively adept at in-fighting as well as out-fighting.\n\nThe essence of a swarmer is non-stop aggression. Many short in-fighters use their stature to their advantage, employing a bob-and-weave defense by bending at the waist to slip underneath or to the sides of incoming punches. Unlike blocking, causing an opponent to miss a punch disrupts his balance, this permits forward movement past the opponent's extended arm and keeps the hands free to counter. A distinct advantage that in-fighters have is when throwing uppercuts, they can channel their entire bodyweight behind the punch; [[Mike Tyson]] was famous for throwing devastating uppercuts. [[Marvin Hagler]] was known for his hard \"[[chin (boxing)|chin]]\", punching power, body attack and the stalking of his opponents. Some in-fighters, like Mike Tyson, have been known for being notoriously hard to hit. The key to a swarmer is aggression, endurance, chin, and bobbing-and-weaving.\n\nNotable in-fighters include [[Henry Armstrong]], [[Aaron Pryor]], [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], [[Jack Dempsey]], [[Shawn Porter]], [[Miguel Cotto]], [[Joe Frazier]], [[Danny Garc\u00eda]], [[Mike Tyson]], [[Manny Pacquiao]], [[Rocky Marciano]],<ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.75</ref> [[Wayne McCullough]], [[Gerry Penalosa]], [[Harry Greb]],<ref>James Roberts, Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.98, 99</ref><ref>James Roberts and Alexander Skutt, ''The Boxing Register'', 1999, p.339, 340</ref> [[David Tua]], [[James Toney]] and [[Ricky Hatton]]. This style was also used by the ''Street Fighter'' character [[Balrog (Street Fighter)|Balrog]].\n\n===Combinations of styles===\nAll fighters have primary skills with which they feel most comfortable, but truly elite fighters are often able to incorporate auxiliary styles when presented with a particular challenge. For example, an out-fighter will sometimes plant his feet and counter punch, or a slugger may have the stamina to pressure fight with his power punches.\n\nOld history of the development of boxing and its prevalence contribute to fusion of various types of martial arts and the emergence of new ones that are based on them. For example, a combination of boxing and sportive sambo techniques gave rise to a combat sambo.\n\n===Style matchups===\n[[File:Joe Louis - Max Schmeling - 1936.jpg|thumb|[[Joe Louis|Louis]] vs. [[Max Schmeling|Schmeling]], 1936]]\n\nThere is a generally accepted rule of thumb about the success each of these boxing styles has against the others. In general, an in-fighter has an advantage over an out-fighter, an out-fighter has an advantage over a brawler, and a brawler has an advantage over an in-fighter; these form a cycle with each style being stronger relative to one, and weaker relative to another, with none dominating, as in [[rock paper scissors]]. Naturally, many other factors, such as the skill level and training of the combatants, determine the outcome of a fight, but the widely held belief in this relationship among the styles is embodied in the clich\u00e9 amongst boxing fans and writers that \"styles make fights.\"\n\nBrawlers tend to overcome swarmers or in-fighters because, in trying to get close to the slugger, the in-fighter will invariably have to walk straight into the guns of the much harder-hitting brawler, so, unless the former has a very good chin and the latter's stamina is poor, the brawler's superior power will carry the day. A famous example of this type of match-up advantage would be [[George Foreman]]'s knockout victory over [[Joe Frazier]] in their original bout \"The Sunshine Showdown\".\n\nAlthough in-fighters struggle against heavy sluggers, they typically enjoy more success against out-fighters or boxers. Out-fighters prefer a slower fight, with some distance between themselves and the opponent. The in-fighter tries to close that gap and unleash furious flurries. On the inside, the out-fighter loses a lot of his combat effectiveness, because he cannot throw the hard punches. The in-fighter is generally successful in this case, due to his intensity in advancing on his opponent and his good agility, which makes him difficult to evade. For example, the swarming Joe Frazier, though easily dominated by the slugger George Foreman, was able to create many more problems for the boxer [[Muhammad Ali]] in their three fights. [[Joe Louis]], after retirement, admitted that he hated being crowded, and that swarmers like untied/undefeated champ [[Rocky Marciano]] would have caused him style problems even in his prime.\n\nThe boxer or out-fighter tends to be most successful against a brawler, whose slow speed (both hand and foot) and poor technique makes him an easy target to hit for the faster out-fighter. The out-fighter's main concern is to stay alert, as the brawler only needs to land one good punch to finish the fight. If the out-fighter can avoid those power punches, he can often wear the brawler down with fast jabs, tiring him out. If he is successful enough, he may even apply extra pressure in the later rounds in an attempt to achieve a knockout. Most classic boxers, such as Muhammad Ali, enjoyed their best successes against sluggers.\n\nAn example of a style matchup was the historical fight of [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez]], a swarmer or in-fighter, against [[Meldrick Taylor]], the boxer or out-fighter (see [[Julio C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez vs. Meldrick Taylor]]). The match was nicknamed \"Thunder Meets Lightning\" as an allusion to punching power of Ch\u00e1vez and blinding speed of Taylor. Ch\u00e1vez was the epitome of the \"Mexican\" style of boxing. Taylor's hand and foot speed and boxing abilities gave him the early advantage, allowing him to begin building a large lead on points. Ch\u00e1vez remained relentless in his pursuit of Taylor and due to his greater punching power Ch\u00e1vez slowly punished Taylor. Coming into the later rounds, Taylor was bleeding from the mouth, his entire face was swollen, the bones around his eye socket had been broken, he had swallowed a considerable amount of his own blood, and as he grew tired, Taylor was increasingly forced into exchanging blows with Ch\u00e1vez, which only gave Ch\u00e1vez a greater chance to cause damage. While there was little doubt that Taylor had solidly won the first three quarters of the fight, the question at hand was whether he would survive the final quarter. Going into the final round, Taylor held a secure lead on the scorecards of two of the three judges. Ch\u00e1vez would have to knock Taylor out to claim a victory, whereas Taylor merely needed to stay away from the Mexican legend. However, Taylor did not stay away, but continued to trade blows with Ch\u00e1vez. As he did so, Taylor showed signs of extreme exhaustion, and every tick of the clock brought Taylor closer to victory unless Ch\u00e1vez could knock him out.\nWith about a minute left in the round, Ch\u00e1vez hit Taylor squarely with several hard punches and stayed on the attack, continuing to hit Taylor with well-placed shots. Finally, with about 25 seconds to go, Ch\u00e1vez landed a hard right hand that caused Taylor to stagger forward towards a corner, forcing Ch\u00e1vez back ahead of him. Suddenly Ch\u00e1vez stepped around Taylor, positioning him so that Taylor was trapped in the corner, with no way to escape from Ch\u00e1vez' desperate final flurry. Ch\u00e1vez then nailed Taylor with a tremendous right hand that dropped the younger man. By using the ring ropes to pull himself up, Taylor managed to return to his feet and was given the mandatory 8-count. Referee Richard Steele asked Taylor twice if he was able to continue fighting, but Taylor failed to answer. Steele then concluded that Taylor was unfit to continue and signaled that he was ending the fight, resulting in a TKO victory for Ch\u00e1vez with only two seconds to go in the bout.\n\n==Equipment==\nSince boxing involves forceful, repetitive punching, precautions must be taken to prevent [[Boxer's fracture|damage to bones in the hand]]. Most trainers do not allow boxers to train and spar without [[wrist wraps]] and [[boxing gloves]]. Hand wraps are used to secure the bones in the hand, and the gloves are used to protect the hands from blunt injury, allowing boxers to throw punches with more force than if they did not use them. Gloves have been required in competition since the late nineteenth century, though modern boxing gloves are much heavier than those worn by early twentieth-century fighters. Prior to a bout, both boxers agree upon the weight of gloves to be used in the bout, with the understanding that lighter gloves allow heavy punchers to inflict more damage. The brand of gloves can also affect the impact of punches, so this too is usually stipulated before a bout. Both sides are allowed to inspect the wraps and gloves of the opponent to help ensure both are within agreed upon specifications and no tampering has taken place.\n\nA [[mouthguard]] is important to protect the teeth and gums from injury, and to cushion the jaw, resulting in a decreased chance of knockout. Both fighters must wear soft soled shoes to reduce the damage from accidental (or intentional) stepping on feet. While older boxing boots more commonly resembled those of a professional wrestler, modern boxing shoes and boots tend to be quite similar to their amateur wrestling counterparts.\n\nBoxers practice their skills on several types of punching bags. A small, tear-drop-shaped \"speed bag\" is used to hone reflexes and repetitive punching skills, while a large cylindrical \"heavy bag\" filled with sand, a synthetic substitute, or water is used to practice power punching and body blows. The double-end bag is usually connected by elastic on the top and bottom and moves randomly upon getting struck and helps the fighter work on accuracy and reflexes. In addition to these distinctive pieces of equipment, boxers also use sport-nonspecific training equipment to build strength, speed, agility, and stamina. Common training equipment includes free weights, rowing machines, [[jump rope]], and [[medicine balls]].\n\nBoxers also use punch/focus mitts in which a trainer calls out certain combinations and the fighter strikes the mitts accordingly. This is a great exercise for stamina as the boxer isn't allowed to go at his own pace but that of the trainer, typically forcing the fighter to endure a higher output and volume than usual. In addition, they also allow trainers to make boxers utilize footwork and distances more accurately.\n\nBoxing matches typically take place in a [[boxing ring]], a raised platform surrounded by ropes attached to posts rising in each corner. The term \"ring\" has come to be used as a metaphor for many aspects of prize fighting in general.\n\n==Technique==\n{{main|Boxing styles and technique}}\n\n===Stance===\nThe modern boxing stance differs substantially from the typical boxing stances of the 19th and early 20th centuries. The modern stance has a more upright vertical-armed guard, as opposed to the more horizontal, knuckles-facing-forward guard adopted by early 20th century hook users such as [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]].\n\n<gallery>\nFile:attitude_droite1.jpg|''Upright stance''\nFile:attitude_semi-enroul\u00e9e1.jpg|''Semi-crouch''\nFile:attitude_enroul\u00e9e1.jpg|''Full crouch''\n</gallery>\n\nIn a fully upright stance, the boxer stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a half-step in front of the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most penetration power). Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches in front of the face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the \"textbook\" stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents. In order to retain their stance boxers take 'the first step in any direction with the foot already leading in that direction.'<ref>Dempsey, Jack, 'Footwork' in ''Championship Fighting Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense'', 1950</ref>\n\nDifferent stances allow for bodyweight to be differently positioned and emphasised; this may in turn alter how powerfully and explosively a type of punch can be delivered. For instance, a crouched stance allows for the bodyweight to be positioned further forward over the lead left leg. If a lead left hook is thrown from this position, it will produce a powerful springing action in the lead leg and produce a more explosive punch. This springing action could not be generated effectively, for this punch, if an upright stance was used or if the bodyweight was positioned predominantly over the back leg.<ref>Dempsey, Jack, 'Stance' in ''Championship Fighting Explosive Punching and Aggressive Defense'', 1950</ref> [[Mike Tyson]] was a keen practitioner of a crouched stance and this style of power punching. The preparatory positioning of the bodyweight over the bent lead leg is also known as an [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometric preload]].\n\nLeft-handed or southpaw fighters use a mirror image of the orthodox stance, which can create problems for orthodox fighters unaccustomed to receiving jabs, hooks, or crosses from the opposite side. The [[southpaw stance]], conversely, is vulnerable to a straight right hand.\n\nNorth American fighters tend to favor a more balanced stance, facing the opponent almost squarely, while many European fighters stand with their torso turned more to the side. The positioning of the hands may also vary, as some fighters prefer to have both hands raised in front of the face, risking exposure to body shots.\n\n===Punches===\nThere are four basic punches in boxing: the jab, cross, hook and uppercut. Any punch other than a jab is considered a power punch. If a boxer is right-handed (orthodox), his left hand is the lead hand and his right hand is the rear hand. For a left-handed boxer or southpaw, the hand positions are reversed. For clarity, the following discussion will assume a right-handed boxer.\n<gallery widths=\"105\">\nFile:jab7.jpg|''[[Jab]]''\nFile:Drop3.jpg|''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]] '' - in counter-punch with a looping\nFile:crochet1.jpg|''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''\nFile:uppercut2.jpg|''[[Uppercut]]''\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Jab]]''' \u2013 A quick, straight punch thrown with the lead hand from the guard position. The jab extends from the side of the torso and typically does not pass in front of it. It is accompanied by a small, clockwise rotation of the torso and hips, while the fist rotates 90 degrees, becoming horizontal upon impact. As the punch reaches full extension, the lead shoulder can be brought up to guard the chin. The rear hand remains next to the face to guard the jaw. After making contact with the target, the lead hand is retracted quickly to resume a guard position in front of the face.\n** The jab is recognized as the most important punch in a boxer's arsenal because it provides a fair amount of its own cover and it leaves the least amount of space for a counter punch from the opponent. It has the longest reach of any punch and does not require commitment or large weight transfers. Due to its relatively weak power, the jab is often used as a tool to gauge distances, probe an opponent's defenses, harass an opponent, and set up heavier, more powerful punches. A half-step may be added, moving the entire body into the punch, for additional power. Some notable boxers who have been able to develop relative power in their jabs and use it to punish or wear down their opponents to some effect include [[Larry Holmes]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko]].\n* '''[[Cross (boxing)|Cross]]''' \u2013 A powerful, straight punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the rear hand is thrown from the chin, crossing the body and traveling towards the target in a straight line. The rear shoulder is thrust forward and finishes just touching the outside of the chin. At the same time, the lead hand is retracted and tucked against the face to protect the inside of the chin. For additional power, the torso and hips are rotated counter-clockwise as the cross is thrown. A measure of an ideally extended cross is that the shoulder of the striking arm, the knee of the front leg and the ball of the front foot are on the same vertical plane.<ref>{{cite web|last=Patterson|first=Jeff|title=Boxing for Fitness: Straight Right|url=http://nwfighting.com/fitnessboxing.html|work=nwfighting.com|publisher=Northwest Fighting Arts|accessdate=12 March 2014}}</ref>\n** Weight is also transferred from the rear foot to the lead foot, resulting in the rear heel turning outwards as it acts as a fulcrum for the transfer of weight. Body rotation and the sudden weight transfer give the cross its power. Like the jab, a half-step forward may be added. After the cross is thrown, the hand is retracted quickly and the guard position resumed. It can be used to counter punch a jab, aiming for the opponent's head (or a counter to a cross aimed at the body) or to set up a hook. The cross is also called a \"straight\" or \"right\", especially if it does not cross the opponent's outstretched jab.\n* '''[[Hook (boxing)|Hook]]''' \u2013 A semi-circular punch thrown with the lead hand to the side of the opponent's head. From the guard position, the elbow is drawn back with a horizontal fist (palm facing down) though in modern times a wide percentage of fighters throw the hook with a vertical fist (palm facing themselves). The rear hand is tucked firmly against the jaw to protect the chin. The torso and hips are rotated clockwise, propelling the fist through a tight, clockwise arc across the front of the body and connecting with the target.\n** At the same time, the lead foot pivots clockwise, turning the left heel outwards. Upon contact, the hook's circular path ends abruptly and the lead hand is pulled quickly back into the guard position. A hook may also target the lower body and this technique is sometimes called the \"rip\" to distinguish it from the conventional hook to the head. The hook may also be thrown with the rear hand. Notable left hookers include [[Joe Frazier]], [[Roy Jones, Jr.|Roy Jones Jr.]] and [[Mike Tyson]].\n[[File:Boxing080905 photoshop.jpg|thumb|[[Ricardo Dominguez]] (''left'') throws an [[uppercut]] on [[Rafael Ortiz]] (''right'').<ref>{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Herbert G.|title=Boxing: A Worldwide Record of Bouts and Boxers|year=2012|publisher=McFarland|location=NC, USA|isbn=978-0-7864-6054-0|url=http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6054-0|access-date=20 July 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120509012702/http://www.mcfarlandpub.com/book-2.php?id=978-0-7864-6054-0|archive-date=9 May 2012|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n* '''[[Uppercut]]''' \u2013 A vertical, rising punch thrown with the rear hand. From the guard position, the torso shifts slightly to the right, the rear hand drops below the level of the opponent's chest and the knees are bent slightly. From this position, the rear hand is thrust upwards in a rising arc towards the opponent's chin or torso.\n** At the same time, the knees push upwards quickly and the torso and hips rotate anti-clockwise and the rear heel turns outward, mimicking the body movement of the cross. The strategic utility of the uppercut depends on its ability to \"lift\" the opponent's body, setting it off-balance for successive attacks. The right uppercut followed by a left hook is a deadly combination employing the uppercut to lift the opponent's chin into a vulnerable position, then the hook to knock the opponent out.\n\nThese different punch types can be thrown in rapid succession to form combinations or \"combos.\" The most common is the jab and cross combination, nicknamed the \"one-two combo.\" This is usually an effective combination, because the jab blocks the opponent's view of the cross, making it easier to land cleanly and forcefully.\n\nA large, swinging circular punch starting from a cocked-back position with the arm at a longer extension than the hook and all of the fighter's weight behind it is sometimes referred to as a \"roundhouse,\" \"haymaker,\" \"overhand,\" or sucker-punch. Relying on body weight and centripetal force within a wide arc, the roundhouse can be a powerful blow, but it is often a wild and uncontrolled punch that leaves the fighter delivering it off balance and with an open guard.\n\nWide, looping punches have the further disadvantage of taking more time to deliver, giving the opponent ample warning to react and counter. For this reason, the haymaker or roundhouse is not a conventional punch, and is regarded by trainers as a mark of poor technique or desperation. Sometimes it has been used, because of its immense potential power, to finish off an already staggering opponent who seems unable or unlikely to take advantage of the poor position it leaves the puncher in.\n\nAnother unconventional punch is the rarely used [[bolo punch]], in which the opponent swings an arm out several times in a wide arc, usually as a distraction, before delivering with either that or the other arm.\n\nAn illegal punch to the back of the head or neck is known as a [[rabbit punch]].\n\nBoth the hook and uppercut may be thrown with both hands, resulting in differing footwork and positioning from that described above if thrown by the other hand. Generally the analogous opposite is true of the footwork and torso movement.\n\n===Defense===\nThere are several basic maneuvers a boxer can use in order to evade or block punches, depicted and discussed below.\n<gallery widths=\"105\">\nFile:slip1.jpg|''[[Slipping]]''\nFile:slip2.jpg|''[[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]]''\nFile:blocage1.jpg|''[[Blocking (martial arts)|Blocking]] (with the arms)''\nFile:protection passive1.jpg|''[[Covering (martial arts)|Cover-Up]] (with the gloves)''\nFile:neutraliser1.jpg|''[[Clinch fighting|Clinching]]''\nFile:pas de retrait.jpg|''[[Footwork (martial arts)|Footwork]]''\nFile:retrait2.jpg|''Pulling away''\n</gallery>\n* '''Slip''' \u2013 [[Slipping]] rotates the body slightly so that an incoming punch passes harmlessly next to the head. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer sharply rotates the hips and shoulders. This turns the chin sideways and allows the punch to \"slip\" past. [[Muhammad Ali]] was famous for extremely fast and close slips, as was an early [[Mike Tyson]].\n* '''Sway or fade''' \u2013 To anticipate a punch and move the upper body or head back so that it misses or has its force appreciably lessened. Also called \"rolling with the punch\" or \" Riding The Punch\".\n* '''Duck''' or '''break''' \u2013 To drop down with the back straight so that a punch aimed at the head glances or misses entirely.\n* '''Bob and weave''' \u2013 [[Bobbing (boxing)|Bobbing]] moves the head laterally and beneath an incoming punch. As the opponent's punch arrives, the boxer bends the legs quickly and simultaneously shifts the body either slightly right or left. Once the punch has been evaded, the boxer \"weaves\" back to an upright position, emerging on either the outside or inside of the opponent's still-extended arm. To move outside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the outside\". To move inside the opponent's extended arm is called \"bobbing to the inside\". Joe Frazier, Jack Dempsey, Mike Tyson and Rocky Marciano were masters of bobbing and weaving.\n* '''Parry/block''' \u2013 [[Parrying]] or [[Blocking (martial arts)|blocking]] uses the boxer's shoulder, hands or arms as defensive tools to protect against incoming attacks. A block generally receives a punch while a parry tends to deflect it. A \"palm\", \"catch\", or \"cuff\" is a defence which intentionally takes the incoming punch on the palm portion of the defender's glove.\n* '''The cover-up''' \u2013 Covering up is the last opportunity (other than rolling with a punch) to avoid an incoming strike to an unprotected face or body. Generally speaking, the hands are held high to protect the head and chin and the forearms are tucked against the torso to impede body shots. When protecting the body, the boxer rotates the hips and lets incoming punches \"roll\" off the guard. To protect the head, the boxer presses both fists against the front of the face with the forearms parallel and facing outwards. This type of guard is weak against attacks from below.\n* The '''[[grappling position#Stand-up positions|clinch]]''' \u2013 Clinching is a form of [[Trapping (martial arts)|trapping]] or a rough form of [[grappling]] and occurs when the distance between both fighters has closed and straight punches cannot be employed. In this situation, the boxer attempts to [[grappling hold|hold]] or \"tie up\" the opponent's hands so he is unable to throw hooks or [[uppercut]]s. To perform a clinch, the boxer loops both hands around the outside of the opponent's shoulders, scooping back under the forearms to grasp the opponent's arms tightly against his own body. In this position, the opponent's arms are pinned and cannot be used to attack. [[Clinching position|Clinching]] is a temporary match state and is quickly dissipated by the referee. Clinching is technically against the rules, and in amateur fights points are deducted fairly quickly for it. It is unlikely, however, to see points deducted for a clinch in professional boxing.\n\n===Unorthodox strategies===\n* '''The \"[[rope-a-dope]]\" strategy''': Used by Muhammad Ali in his 1974 \"[[the Rumble in the Jungle]]\" bout against George Foreman, the rope-a-dope method involves lying back against the ropes, covering up defensively as much as possible and allowing the opponent to attempt numerous punches. The back-leaning posture, which does not cause the defending boxer to become as unbalanced as he would during normal backward movement, also maximizes the distance of the defender's head from his opponent, increasing the probability that punches will miss their intended target. Weathering the blows that do land, the defender lures the opponent into expending energy while conserving his/her own. If successful, the attacking opponent will eventually tire, creating defensive flaws which the boxer can exploit. In modern boxing, the rope-a-dope is generally discouraged since most opponents are not fooled by it and few boxers possess the physical toughness to withstand a prolonged, unanswered assault. Recently, however, [[Octuple champion|eight-division world champion]] [[Manny Pacquiao]] skillfully used the strategy to gauge the power of welterweight titlist [[Miguel Cotto]] in November 2009. Pacquiao followed up the rope-a-dope gambit with a withering knockdown. [[Tyson Fury]] also attempted this against Francesco Pianeto but didn't pull it off as smoothly.\n* '''[[Bolo punch]]''': Occasionally seen in Olympic boxing, the bolo is an arm punch which owes its power to the shortening of a [[circular arc]] rather than to transference of body weight; it tends to have more of an effect due to the surprise of the odd angle it lands at rather than the actual power of the punch. This is more of a gimmick than a technical maneuver; this punch is not taught, being on the same plane in boxing technicality as is the [[Muhammad Ali|Ali shuffle]]. Nevertheless, a few professional boxers have used the bolo-punch to great effect, including former [[welterweight]] champions [[Sugar Ray Leonard]], and [[Kid Gavil\u00e1n]] as well as current British fighter [[Chris Eubank Jr.|Chris Eubank Jr]]. Middleweight champion [[Ceferino Garcia]] is regarded as the inventor of the bolo punch.\n<gallery>\nFile:contre_bolo1.jpg| ''[[Bolo punch]]''\nFile:drop1.jpg| ''[[overhand (boxing)|Overhand (overcut)]]''\n</gallery>\n* '''[[Drop (boxing)|Overhand]]''': The overhand is a punch, thrown from the rear hand, not found in every boxer's arsenal. Unlike the cross, which has a trajectory parallel to the ground, the overhand has a looping circular arc as it is thrown over the shoulder with the palm facing away from the boxer. It is especially popular with smaller stature boxers trying to reach taller opponents. Boxers who have used this punch consistently and effectively include former heavyweight champions [[Rocky Marciano]] and [[Tim Witherspoon]], as well as MMA champions [[Chuck Liddell]] and [[Fedor Emelianenko]]. The overhand has become a popular weapon in other tournaments that involve fist striking. [[Deontay Wilder]] heavily favours and is otherwise known for knocking many of his opponents out with one of his right overhands.\n* '''[[Check hook]]''': A check hook is employed to prevent aggressive boxers from lunging in. There are two parts to the check hook. The first part consists of a regular hook. The second, trickier part involves the footwork. As the opponent lunges in, the boxer should throw the hook and pivot on his left foot and swing his right foot 180 degrees around. If executed correctly, the aggressive boxer will lunge in and sail harmlessly past his opponent like a bull missing a matador. This is rarely seen in professional boxing as it requires a great disparity in skill level to execute. Technically speaking it has been said that there is no such thing as a check hook and that it is simply a hook applied to an opponent that has lurched forward and past his opponent who simply hooks him on the way past. Others have argued that the check hook exists but is an illegal punch due to it being a pivot punch which is illegal in the sport. [[Floyd Mayweather, Jr.]] employed the use of a check hook against [[Ricky Hatton]], which sent Hatton flying head first into the corner post and being knocked down.\n\n==Ring corner==\n[[File:2017-12-02 Tina Rupprecht - Anne Sophie Da Costa - DSC2771.jpg|thumb|right|Female boxer [[Tina Rupprecht]] receiving instructions from her trainer while being treated by her cutman in the ring corner between rounds.]]\nIn boxing, each fighter is given a corner of the ring where he rests in between rounds for 1 minute and where his trainers stand. Typically, three men stand in the corner besides the boxer himself; these are the trainer, the assistant trainer and the [[cutman]]. The trainer and assistant typically give advice to the boxer on what he is doing wrong as well as encouraging him if he is losing. The cutman is a cutaneous [[physician|doctor]] responsible for keeping the boxer's face and eyes free of cuts, blood and excessive swelling. This is of particular importance because many fights are stopped because of cuts or swelling that threaten the boxer's eyes.\n\nIn addition, the corner is responsible for stopping the fight if they feel their fighter is in grave danger of permanent injury. The corner will occasionally throw in a white towel to signify a boxer's surrender (the idiomatic phrase \"to throw in the towel\", meaning to give up, derives from this practice).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/throw-in-the-towel.html |title=Phrases.org |publisher=Phrases.org |date= |accessdate=18 May 2012}}</ref> This can be seen in the fight between [[Diego Corrales]] and [[Floyd Mayweather]]. In that fight, Corrales' corner surrendered despite Corrales' steadfast refusal.\n\n==Medical concerns==\n{{see also|Dementia pugilistica|The distance (boxing)#Distance change criticisms}}\nKnocking a person unconscious or even causing a [[concussion]] may cause permanent [[brain damage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/363957.stm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020918102719/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/medical_notes/363957.stm|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 September 2002|title=Boxing: The health risks|access-date=6 May 2010}}</ref> There is no clear division between the force required to knock a person out and the force likely to kill a person.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/4437|title=Better and Safer Boxing: Ringside and Boardroom Medical Control of Boxing Careers in the Twentieth Century|website=Dora.dmu.ac.uk|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=June 2006|last1=Carter|first1=Neil}}</ref> From 1980 to 2007, more than 200 amateur boxers, professional boxers and [[Toughman Contest|Toughman]] fighters died due to ring or training injuries.<ref>Svinth, Joseph R.

They are then sung by professional playback singers and lip-synched by the actors. Bollywood cinema is unique in that the majority of songs are seen to be sung by the characters themselves rather than being played in the background.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In Western cinema, often a composer who specialises in film music is responsible for the bulk of music on the film's [[soundtrack]], and while in some films songs may play an important part (and have direct relationship to the subject of the film), in Bollywood films, the songs often drive large-scale ''production numbers'' featuring elaborate choreography.\n\nThe key figure in Bollywood music production and composition is the ''music director''. While in Western films, a \"[[music director]]\" or \"music coordinator\" is usually responsible for selecting existing recorded music to add to the soundtrack, typically during opening and closing credits, in Bollywood films, the \"music director\" often has a much broader role encompassing both composing music/songs specifically for the film and (if needed) securing additional (licensed) music. In this sense, a Bollywood music director also plays the role of a [[composer]] and [[music producer]].\n\nThe ''lyricist'' of Bollywood songs is less likely to be the same composer or music director, as Bollywood films often go to great lengths to include lyrics of special significance and applicability to the film's plot and dialogue, and/or the words of highly regarded poets/lyricists set to music written specifically for such words in the film, as noted above.\n\nBollywood film songs have been described as eclectic both in instrumentation and style.<ref>Morcom, Anna (2007) ''Hindi Film Songs and the Cinema''.

Examples include \"Tere Bin Nahin Jeena\" (''[[Kachche Dhaage]]''), \"Arziyan\" (''[[Delhi 6]]''), \"Khwaja Mere Khwaja\" (''[[Jodhaa Akbar]]'')<ref>[http://www.hindigeetmala.net/song/khwaja_mere_khwaja_dil_mein.htm Filmi qawwali from film Jodha Akbar (2008) on hindigeetmala.net website] Retrieved 19 May 2018</ref> and \"Kun Faya Kun\" (''[[Rockstar (2011 film)|Rockstar]]'').<ref>[http://muvyz.com/song/da848873 Filmi qawwali in Rockstar (2011 film) on muvyz.com website] Retrieved 19 May 2018</ref>\n\n===Rock===\n{{Main|Indian rock}}\n{{See|Raga rock|Sufi rock}}\n\nIndian musicians began fusing rock with traditional Indian music from the mid-1960s onwards in ''[[filmi]]'' songs produced for popular Bollywood films. Some of the more well known early rock songs (including styles such as [[funk rock]], [[pop rock]], [[psychedelic rock]], [[raga rock]], and [[soft rock]]) from Bollywood films include [[Mohammed Rafi]]'s \"[[Jaan Pehechan Ho]]\" in ''[[Gumnaam]]'' (1965), [[Kishore Kumar]]'s \"O Saathi Re\" in ''[[Muqaddar Ka Sikandar]]'' (1978), and [[Asha Bhosle]] songs such as \"[[Dum Maro Dum (song)|Dum Maro Dum]]\" in ''[[Hare Rama Hare Krishna (1971 film)|Hare Rama Hare Krishna]]'' (1971), \"Ae Naujawan Hai Sab\" in ''[[Apradh]]'' (1972), and \"Yeh Mera Dil Pyar Ka Diwana\" in ''[[Don (1978 film)|Don]]'' (1978).\n\n==Plagiarism==\nThe Pakistani [[Qawwali]] musician [[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] had a big impact on Bollywood music, inspiring numerous Indian musicians working in [[Bollywood]], especially during the 1990s. However, there were many instances of Indian music directors plagiarising Khan's music to produce hit [[filmi]] songs.<ref name=\"hindu\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20011230173145/www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1418/14181230.htm|title=The stilled voice |author=Amit Baruah, R.

This was closely followed by ''Shirheen Farhad'' (1931) by [[Jamshedji Framji Madan]], also by Madan, which had as many as 42 song sequences strung together in the manner of an opera, and later by ''Indra Sabha'' which had as many as 69 song sequences. However, the practice subsided and subsequent films usually featured between six and ten songs in each production.<ref name=\"GopalMoorti2008\"/>{{rp|20}}\n\nRight from the advent of Indian cinema in 1931, musicals with song numbers have been a regular feature in Indian cinema.<ref name=\"Morcom2007\">{{cite book|last=Morcom|first=Anna|title=Hindi film songs and the cinema|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kfVdxiSm-aYC&pg=PA208|accessdate=22 January 2012|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|isbn=978-0-7546-5198-7|pages=1\u201324|chapter=The cinematic study of Hindi film songs}}</ref> In 1934 Hindi film songs began to be recorded on gramophones and later, played on radio channels, giving rise to a new form of mass entertainment in India which was responsive to popular demand.<ref name=\"Morcom2007\"/> Within the first few years itself, Hindi cinema had produced a variety of films which easily categorised into genres such as \"historicals\", \"mythologicals\", \"devotional, \"fantasy\" etc. but each having songs embedded in them such that it is incorrect to classify them as \"musicals\".<ref name=\"GopalMoorti2008\"/>\n\nThe Hindi song was such an integral features of Hindi mainstream cinema, besides other characteristics, that post-independence alternative cinema, of which the [[Satyajit Ray filmography|films]] of [[Satyajit Ray]] are an example, discarded the song and dance motif in its effort to stand apart from mainstream cinema.<ref name=\"GopalMoorti2008\"/>\n\nThe Hindi film song now began to make its presence felt as a predominating characteristic in the culture of the nation and began to assume roles beyond the limited purview of cinema. In multi-cultural India, as per film historian Partha Chatterjee, \"the Hindi film song cut through all the language barriers in India, to engage in lively communication with the nation where more than twenty languages are spoken and ... scores of dialects exist\".<ref>As quoted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=19JBf6oDOy0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Bollywood+music&hl=en&sa=X&ei=e6AdT8LIHsnHrQee2ezWDQ&ved=0CEcQuwUwAA#v=onepage&q=Bollywood%20music&f=false Gopal & Moorti (2008), pg 14].</ref> Bollywood music has drawn its inspiration from numerous traditional sources such as ''[[Ramleela]]'', ''[[nautanki]]'', ''[[tamasha]]'' and [[Parsi theatre]], as well as from the West, Pakistan, and other Indic musical subcultures.<ref name=\"MehtaPandharipande2010\">{{cite book|last1=Mehta|first1=Rini Bhattacharya|last2=Pandharipande|first2=Rajeshwari|title=Bollywood and Globalization: Indian Popular Cinema, Nation, and Diaspora|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cgZTUn00crMC&pg=PA176|accessdate=22 January 2012|date=15 January 2010|publisher=Anthem Press|isbn=978-1-84331-833-0|page=36}}</ref>\n\nFor over five decades, these songs formed the staple of popular music in South Asia and along with Hindi films, was an important cultural export to most countries around Asia and wherever the Indian diaspora had spread. The spread was galvanised by the advent of cheap plastic tape cassettes which were produced in the millions till the industry crashed in 2000.<ref name=\"Morcom2007\"/> Even today Hindi film songs are available on radio, on television, as live music by performers, and on media, both old and new such as cassette tapes, compact disks and DVDs and are easily available, both legally and illegally, on the internet.<ref name=\"GopalMoorti2008\"/>\n\n==Style and format==\nThe various use of languages in Bollywood songs can be complex. Most use variations of Hindi and Urdu, with some songs also including other languages such as [[Persian language|Persian]], and it is not uncommon to hear the use of [[English language|English]] words in songs from modern Hindi movies. Besides Hindi, several other Indian languages have also been used including [[Braj]], [[Avadhi]], [[Bhojpuri]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Bengali language|Bengali]] and [[Rajasthani language|Rajasthani]].\n\nIn a film, music, both in itself and accompanied with dance, has been used for many purposes including \"heightening a situation, accentuating a mood, commenting on theme and action, providing relief and serving as interior monologue.\"<ref name=\"MehtaPandharipande2010\"/>\n\n==Production==\nSongs in Bollywood movies are deliberately crafted with lyrics often written by distinguished poets or ''literati'' (often different from those who write the film script), and these lyrics are often then set to music, carefully choreographed to match the dance routine or script of the film. They are then sung by professional playback singers and lip-synched by the actors. Bollywood cinema is unique in that the majority of songs are seen to be sung by the characters themselves rather than being played in the background.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In Western cinema, often a composer who specialises in film music is responsible for the bulk of music on the film's [[soundtrack]], and while in some films songs may play an important part (and have direct relationship to the subject of the film), in Bollywood films, the songs often drive large-scale ''production numbers'' featuring elaborate choreography.\n\nThe key figure in Bollywood music production and composition is the ''music director''. While in Western films, a \"[[music director]]\" or \"music coordinator\" is usually responsible for selecting existing recorded music to add to the soundtrack, typically during opening and closing credits, in Bollywood films, the \"music director\" often has a much broader role encompassing both composing music/songs specifically for the film and (if needed) securing additional (licensed) music. In this sense, a Bollywood music director also plays the role of a [[composer]] and [[music producer]].\n\nThe ''lyricist'' of Bollywood songs is less likely to be the same composer or music director, as Bollywood films often go to great lengths to include lyrics of special significance and applicability to the film's plot and dialogue, and/or the words of highly regarded poets/lyricists set to music written specifically for such words in the film, as noted above.\n\nBollywood film songs have been described as eclectic both in instrumentation and style.<ref>Morcom, Anna (2007) ''Hindi Film Songs and the Cinema''. Aldershot: Ashgate.</ref> They often employ foreign instruments and rework existing songs, showing remarkable inventiveness in the reinvention of melodies and instrumental techniques.<ref>[http://arpjournal.com/858/the-cultural-economy-of-sound-reinventing-technology-in-indian-popular-cinema/ Carlo Nardi (July 2011). \"The Cultural Economy of Sound: Reinventing Technology in Indian Popular Cinema\".

A newer variation of the techno-qawwali based on the more dance oriented tracks is known as the \"club qawwali\". More tracks of this nature are being recorded and released. \n\n[[Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan]] and [[A.R. Rahman]] have composed filmi qawwalis in the style of traditional qawwali.

It was then released in South Korea by [[CJ Entertainment]] on 30 May 2019.\n\nThe film received universal critical acclaim, with praise directed towards its screenplay, Bong's direction, acting, social commentary, dark humor, cinematography, editing and production values, and has featured in multiple listings of the best films of the 2010s and is considered one of the [[List of films considered the best|best South Korean films of all time]].

Leaving to study abroad, he suggests that Ki-woo takes over his job as an English [[tutor]] for the wealthy Park family, though Ki-woo is initially hesitant. Ki-jung forges a diploma from [[Yonsei University]] for Ki-woo to help him get hired; upon arrival, Mrs. Park decides they will call him \"Kevin\".\n\nThe Kim family infiltrates the lives of the Parks by recommending each other's services, posing as unrelated and highly qualified workers. Ki-woo tutors and begins a romance with the Parks' daughter, Da-hye. Ki-jung poses as \"Jessica\", an [[Art therapy|art therapist]] to the Parks' hyperactive young son, Da-song. Ki-jung frames Mr. Park's chauffeur as having had [[sex]] in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr. Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach [[allergy]] of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs. Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] [[bakery]] failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal to Moon-gwang the truth about them.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs. Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a [[seizure]]-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] on a previous birthday when he saw a \"ghost\" \u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement \u2013 and that the family has celebrated Da-song's birthday outside the house ever since. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr. Park's offhand comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe romanisation of the names of characters are as appeared in the official English subtitles, translated by [[Darcy Paquet]].\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Park<!-- Not Kim, as Korean women don't follow their husbands' names after marriage. --> Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* Park Geun-rok as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013. While working on ''[[Snowpiercer]]'', Bong was encouraged by a theatre actor friend to write a play. He had been a tutor for the son of a wealthy family in Seoul in his early 20s, and considered turning his experience into a stage production.<ref name =\"THRBrzeski\">{{cite news|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/making-parasite-how-bong-joon-hos-real-life-inspired-a-plot-twisty-tale-rich-poor-1252015|title=Making of 'Parasite': How Bong Joon Ho's Real Life Inspired a Plot-Twisty Tale of Rich vs. Poor|last=Brzeski|first=Patrick|date=8 November 2019|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|access-date=18 January 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200113115829/https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/features/making-parasite-how-bong-joon-hos-real-life-inspired-a-plot-twisty-tale-rich-poor-1252015|archive-date=13 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> The film's title, ''Parasite'', was selected by Bong as it served a double meaning, which he had to convince the film's marketing group to use. Bong said \"Because the story is about the poor family infiltrating and creeping into the rich house, it seems very obvious that ''Parasite'' refers to the poor family, and I think that's why the marketing team was a little hesitant.

In terms of practical lighting, the DP [director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color.

Ki-jung frames Mr. Park's chauffeur as having had [[sex]] in the car by leaving her underwear beneath the passenger seat for Mr. Park to discover, and Ki-taek is hired to replace him. Finally, Chung-sook takes over as the Parks' housekeeper after the Kims exploit the severe peach [[allergy]] of the long-time housekeeper, Moon-gwang, and convince Mrs. Park that she has [[tuberculosis]].\n\nWhen the Parks leave on a camping trip for Da-song's birthday, the Kims revel in the luxuries of the Park residence. Moon-gwang returns, telling Chung-sook she has left something in the house's basement, and reveals the hidden entrance to an [[Bunker|underground bunker]] created by the house's architect and previous owner. Moon-gwang's husband, Geun-sae, has been secretly living underneath the home for years, hiding from [[loan shark]]s after his [[Taiwan|Taiwanese]] [[bakery]] failed and left him in huge debt. Chung-sook refuses Moon-gwang's pleas to help Geun-sae remain in the bunker, but the eavesdropping Kims accidentally reveal to Moon-gwang the truth about them.\n\nA severe rainstorm brings the Parks home early, and the Kims scramble to clean up the home before the Parks return, while a brawl breaks out between Moon-gwang, Geun-sae, and the Kims. The Kims trap Geun-sae and a mortally wounded Moon-gwang in the bunker, and Ki-taek sees Geun-sae sending a fruitless message in [[SKATS|Morse code]] using the home's lights. Mrs. Park reveals to Chung-sook that Da-song had a [[seizure]]-inducing [[Psychological trauma|traumatic experience]] on a previous birthday when he saw a \"ghost\" \u2013 actually Geun-sae emerging from the basement \u2013 and that the family has celebrated Da-song's birthday outside the house ever since. The Kims escape the Parks' house unseen, but not before hearing Mr. Park's offhand comment that Ki-taek, despite being a good employee, smells bad. Returning home to find their apartment completely flooded by the storm, the Kims are forced to sleep in a gymnasium with other displaced people.\n\nThe next day, Mrs. Park hosts a house party for Da-song's birthday, with the Kim family in attendance. Ki-woo enters the bunker with the scholar's rock to face Geun-sae. Finding Moon-gwang dead, he is attacked by Geun-sae, who bludgeons him with the rock and escapes. Seeking to avenge Moon-gwang, Geun-sae stabs Ki-jung with a kitchen knife in front of the horrified guests. Da-song suffers another seizure upon seeing Geun-sae, and a struggle breaks out until Chung-sook fatally impales Geun-sae with a barbecue skewer. While Ki-taek tends to a severely bleeding Ki-jung, Mr. Park orders him to drive Da-song to the hospital. In the chaos, Ki-taek, upon seeing Mr. Park's disgusted reaction to Geun-sae's smell, takes the knife and kills Mr. Park before fleeing the scene.\n\nWeeks later, Ki-woo wakes up after brain surgery. He and Chung-sook are convicted of [[fraud]] and put on probation. Ki-jung has died from her injury and Ki-taek, wanted for Mr. Park's murder, has vanished. Geun-sae's motives for the attack are a mystery to the public. Ki-woo watches the Parks' home, which has been sold to a German family unaware of its history and sees a message in Morse code from the flickering lights. It is from Ki-taek, who escaped into the bunker and now survives by scavenging from the new homeowners. Still living in the banjiha with his mother, Ki-woo writes a letter to Ki-taek, vowing to earn enough money to one day purchase the house and free his father.\n\n== Cast ==\nThe romanisation of the names of characters are as appeared in the official English subtitles, translated by [[Darcy Paquet]].\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Song Kang-ho]] as Kim Ki-taek ({{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\ud0dd|rr=Gim Gitaek|labels=no}}), father of the Kim family\n* [[Choi Woo-shik]] as Kim Ki-woo (Kevin; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc6b0|rr=Gim Giu|labels=no}}), son of the Kim family\n* [[Park So-dam]] as Kim Ki-jung (Jessica; {{Korean|hangul=\uae40\uae30\uc815|rr=Gim Gijeong|labels=no}}), daughter of the Kim family\n* [[Jang Hye-jin (actress)|Jang Hye-jin]] as Park<!-- Not Kim, as Korean women don't follow their husbands' names after marriage. --> Chung-sook ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ucda9\uc219|rr=Bak Chungsuk|labels=no}}), mother of the Kim family\n* [[Lee Sun-kyun]] as Park Dong-ik (Nathan; {{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub3d9\uc775|rr=Bak Dongik|labels=no}}), father of the Park family\n* [[Cho Yeo-jeong]] as Choi Yeon-gyo ({{Korean|hangul=\ucd5c\uc5f0\uad50|rr=Choe Yeongyo|labels=no}}), mother of the Park family\n* [[Jung Ji-so]] as Park Da-hye ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\ud61c|rr=Bak Dahye|labels=no}}), daughter of the Park family\n* [[Jung Hyeon-jun]] as Park Da-song ({{Korean|hangul=\ubc15\ub2e4\uc1a1|rr=Bak Dasong|labels=no}}), son of the Park family\n* [[Lee Jung-eun (actress)|Lee Jung-eun]] as Gook Moon-gwang ({{Korean|hangul=\uad6d\ubb38\uad11|rr=Guk Mungwang|labels=no}}), the housekeeper\n* [[Park Myung-hoon]] as Oh Geun-sae ({{Korean|hangul=\uc624\uadfc\uc138|rr=O Geunse|labels=no}}), Moon-gwang's husband\n* Park Geun-rok as Yoon ({{Korean|hangul=\uc724|rr=Yun|labels=no}}), Kim Ki-taek's predecessor as Park Dong-ik's chauffeur\n* [[Park Seo-joon]] as Min-hyuk ({{Korean|hangul=\ubbfc\ud601|rr=Minhyeok|labels=no}}), Ki-woo's friend (cameo appearance)<ref>{{cite news |last1=Park |first1=Boram |title='Rom-com master' Park Seo-joon embraces career-changing role in action horror film |url=https://en.yna.co.kr/view/AEN20190725009700315 |accessdate=2 March 2020 |agency=[[Yonhap News Agency]] |date=25 July 2019 |language=en}}<!-- Note that the English report is basically a translation of the original interview in Korean [https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20190724141500005], but the Korean one does not mention Park Seo-joon's cameo appearance in Parasite (unlike the English version). --></ref>\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n\n=== Development ===\nThe idea for ''Parasite'' originated in 2013.

In terms of practical lighting, the DP [director of photography Hong Kyung-pyo] had specific requests regarding the color. He wanted sophisticated indirect lighting and the warmth from [[Incandescent light bulb|tungsten light sources]].
