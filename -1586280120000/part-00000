It was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in [[Pre-Columbian era#North America|pre-Columbian North America]]. After contact with [[:Category:Spanish explorers of the Pacific|Spanish explorers]], most of the Native Americans died out from  bend over  disease\n\nAfter the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] of 1769\u201370, Spanish missionaries began setting up 21 [[Spanish missions in California|California Missions]] on or near the coast of [[Alta California|Alta (Upper) California]], beginning with the [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1|Mission San Diego de Alcala]] near the location of the modern day city of San Diego, California. During the same period, Spanish military forces built several forts (''[[presidio]]s'') and three small towns (''pueblos''). Two of the pueblos would eventually grow into the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. After Mexican Independence was won in 1821, California fell under the jurisdiction of the [[First Mexican Empire]]. Fearing the influence of the Roman Catholic church over their newly independent nation, the Mexican government [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|closed all of the missions]] and nationalized the church's property. They left behind a small \"[[Californio]]\" (white Hispanic) population of several thousand families, with a few small military garrisons. After the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846\u201348, Mexico was forced to relinquish any claim to California to the United States. The unexpected discovery of gold at [[Sutter's Mill]] in 1848 produced a spectacular [[California Gold Rush|gold rush in Northern California]], attracting hundreds of thousand of ambitious young men from around the world. Only a few struck it rich, and many returned home disappointed. Most appreciated the other economic opportunities in California, especially in agriculture, and brought their families to join them. California became the 31st US state in 1850 and played a small role in the American Civil War. Chinese immigrants increasingly came under attack from [[Nativism (politics)#United States|nativists]]; they were forced out of industry and agriculture and into [[Chinatown]]s in the larger cities. As gold petered out, California increasingly became a highly productive agricultural society. The coming of the railroads in 1869 linked its rich economy with the rest of the nation, and attracted a steady stream of migrants. In the late 19th century, Southern California, especially Los Angeles, started to grow rapidly.\n\n==History of California through 1899==\n{{main|History of California through 1899}}\n\n===Pre-contact period===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of California}}\n[[File:Tikhanov - Balthazar Inhabitant of Northern California (1818).png|200px|thumb|''Balthazar, [[indigenous peoples of California|Inhabitant of Northern California]]'', painting by [[Mikhail Tikhanov]].]]\nDifferent tribes of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] lived in the area that is now California for an estimated 13,000 to 15,000 years.

This popular Spanish fantasy was printed in several editions with the earliest surviving edition published about 1510. In exploring [[Baja California]] the earliest explorers thought the [[Baja California peninsula]] was an island and applied the name ''California'' to it.<ref>Chapman, Charles. ''A History of California: The Spanish Period'', Macmillan Company 1939, pp. 57\u201369</ref> Mapmakers started using the name \"California\" to label the unexplored territory on the North American west coast.\n\nEuropean explorers flying the flags of Spain and of England explored the Pacific Coast of California beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the west coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California peninsula|Baja California]] was a peninsula,<ref>Gutierrez, Ramon A, and Richard J. Orsi, ''Contested Eden: California before the Gold Rush'', University of California Press,1998, {{ISBN|0-520-21273-8}}, p. 81-82</ref> but in spite of his discoveries the myth persisted in European circles that California was an [[Island of California|island]].\n\nRumors of fabulously wealthy cities located somewhere along the California coast, as well as a possible [[Northwest Passage]] that would provide a much shorter route to the [[Indies]], provided an incentive to explore further.\n\n====First European contact (1542)====\nThe first European to explore the California coast was [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo]] ({{lang-pt|Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues Cabrilho}}), working for Spain. He died in southern California in 1543. Cabrillo and his men found that there was essentially nothing for the Spanish to easily exploit in California, and located at the extreme limits of exploration and trade from Spain it would be left essentially unexplored and unsettled for the next 234 years.\n\nThe Cabrillo expedition depicted the Indigenous populations as living at a subsistence level, typically located in small [[rancheria]]s of extended family groups of [[Dunbar's number|100 to 150 people]].<ref name=\"fourdir\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fourdir.com/california_cultures.htm|publisher=Four Directions Institute|title=California Indian Cultures|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref> They had no apparent agriculture as understood by Europeans, no domesticated animals except dogs, no pottery; their tools were made out of wood, leather, woven baskets and netting, stone, and antler. Some shelters were made of branches and mud; some dwellings were built by digging into the ground two to three feet and then building a brush shelter on top covered with animal skins, [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tules]] and/or mud.<ref name=\"fourdir\"/> The Cabrillo expedition did not see the far north of California, where on the coast and somewhat inland traditional architecture consists of rectangular redwood or cedar plank semisubterranean houses.\n\nTraditional clothing was minimal in the summer, with tanned deerhide and other animal leathers and furs and coarse woven articles of grass clothing used in winter. Feathers were sewn into prayer pieces worn for ceremonies. Some tribes around [[Santa Barbara, California]] and the [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]] were using large plank canoes to fish and trade, while tribes in the California delta and San Francisco Bay Area were using tule canoes and some tribes on the Northwest coast carved redwood [[Dugout (boat)|dugout]] canoes.<ref name=\"fourdir\"/>\n\nThe staple foods then used by other Indigenous American tribes, corn and/or potatoes, would not grow without irrigation in the typically short three- to five-month wet season and nine- to seven-month dry seasons of California (see [[Mediterranean climate]]). Despite this, the natural abundance of California, and the environmental management techniques developed by California tribes over millennia, allowed for the highest population density in the Americas north of Mexico.<ref>Lightfoot, Kent and Otis Parrish (2009).

University of California Press, Berkeley. pp. 2\u201313. {{ISBN|978-0520256903}}</ref> Indigenous populations thrived on salmon and other fish, [[deer]], [[tule elk]], acorns, pine nuts, small game, mollusks, grass seed, berries, insects, edible plants, bulbs, and roots, making it possible to sustain a subsistence hunter-gatherer economy without agriculture as known by Europeans but by means of sophisticated management of landscapes and vegetation with regular, controlled low-intensity burning. This tradition of landscape management through fire ecology maintained acorn groves and other food sources, which along with knowledge of migratory herds such as elk and anadromous runs of salmon in the rivers, supported villages, small tribes, and extended family groups.\n\nA dietary staple for most Indigenous populations in interior California was [[acorn]]s, which were dried, shelled, ground to flour, soaked in water to leach out their [[tannin]], and cooked. The grinding holes worn into large rocks over centuries of use are still visible in many rocks today.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?Content1=1416&Content2=1434&Content3=1326 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429222224/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?Content1=1416&Content2=1434&Content3=1326 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2009-04-29 | title=Virtual Tours}}</ref> The ground and leached acorn flour was usually cooked into a nutritious mush, eaten daily with other traditional foods. Acorn preparation was a very labor-intensive process nearly always done by women. There are estimates that some Indigenous populations might have eaten as much as one ton of acorns in one year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/pacific/education/curriculum/4th-grade/acorn.html|title=Acorn consumption|website=Archives.gov|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222210032/http://www.archives.gov/pacific/education/curriculum/4th-grade/acorn.html|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> Families tended productive oak and tanoak groves for generations.

Local trade between Indigenous populations enabled them to acquire seasonings such as salt, or foodstuffs and other goods that might be rare in certain locales, such as flint or obsidian for making spear and arrow points. Native cultures in California are much different from other cultures of Indigenous populations in North America, and some have survived to the present day.\n\nCalifornia indigenous language diversity numbered 80 to 90 languages and dialects, some surviving to the present although endangered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/california-languages.php|accessdate=25 February 2018|title=Survey of California and Other Indian Languages|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523020014/http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/california-languages.php|archive-date=23 May 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The high and rugged [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains located behind the [[Great Basin Desert]] east of California, extensive forests and mountains in the north, the rugged and harsh [[Sonoran Desert]] and [[Mojave Desert]] in the south and the Pacific Ocean on the west effectively isolated California from easy trade or tribal interactions with Indigenous populations on the rest of the continent, and delayed the tragedies and damages of colonial-settler arrival until the Spanish missions, the Gold Rush, and the Euro-American invasion of indigenous Californians' territories.\n\n====Spanish trading route (1565)====\nIn 1565 the Spanish developed a trading route where they took gold and silver from the Americas and traded it for goods and spices from China and other Asian areas. The Spanish set up their main base in the [[Philippines]]. The trade with Mexico involved using an annual passage of [[Manila galleon]](s). The Eastbound galleons first went north to about 40 degrees [[latitude]] and then turning East they could use the westerly [[trade wind]]s and currents. These galleons, after crossing most of the Pacific Ocean, would arrive off the California coast from 60 to over 120 days later somewhere near [[Cape Mendocino]] (about {{convert|300|mi|km}} north of San Francisco) at about 40 degrees N. latitude. They then could turn south down the California coast utilizing the available winds and the south flowing (about 1&nbsp;mi/hr (1.6&nbsp;km/h)) [[California Current]]. After sailing about {{convert|1500|mi|km|}} south on they eventually reached their home port in Mexico. [[San Francisco Bay]] escaped discovery for two centuries until it was finally discovered by land exploration in 1769.\n\n====Francis Drake's claim (1579)====\n[[File:Sir Francis Drake Quadracentennial Plaque at Drake's Beach, Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin County, California.JPG|thumb|Francis Drake \"Nova Albion\" Quadracentennial Plaque at Drake's Beach]]\nThe English explorer and [[privateer]] [[Francis Drake]] sailed south along the coast of northern California in 1579 after capturing two Spanish treasure ships in the Pacific. It is believed Drake put ashore somewhere north of San Francisco, where the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' underwent extensive repairs and accumulated needed supplies for a trip across the Pacific. Leaving California, he completed the second recorded [[circumnavigation]] of the world (after [[Ferdinand Magellan]]) in 1580.\n\nThe exact location of Drake's port is still undetermined, but a prominent bay on the California coast, [[Drakes Bay]], bears his name. He claimed all the land south of 42 degrees latitude, north of the imprecise Spanish claims and eastward from coast to coast for England, calling it [[Nova Albion]]. The term \"Nova Albion\" was often used on European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish claims. Spanish maps, explorations etc., of this and later eras were generally not published, being regarded as state secrets. As was typical in this era, there were conflicting claims to the same territory, and the indigenous peoples who lived there were never consulted.\n\nIn 1602, sixty years after Cabrillo, the Spaniard [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]] explored California's coastline from San Diego as far north as [[Monterey Bay]]. He named [[San Diego Bay]].  He also put ashore in [[Monterey, California]] and made glowing reports of the Monterey bay area as a possible anchorage for ships with land suitable for growing crops. He also provided rudimentary charts of the coastal waters, which were used for nearly 200 years.\n\n===Spanish colonial period (1769\u20131821)===\n[[File:Misi\u00f3n Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3]], [[Loreto, Baja California Sur]], was founded in 1697.]]\n\n{{anchor|Spanishsettlement}}The Spanish divided California into two parts, [[Baja California]] and [[Alta California]], as provinces of [[New Spain]] (Mexico). Baja or lower California consisted of the [[Baja Peninsula]] and terminated roughly at [[San Diego, California]] where Alta California started. The eastern and northern boundaries of Alta California were very indefinite, as the Spanish, despite a lack of physical presence and settlements, claimed essentially everything in what is now the western United States.\n\nThe first permanent [[Spanish missions in Baja California|mission]] in Baja California, [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3]], was founded  on October 15, 1697, by [[Jesuit]] priest [[Juan Maria Salvatierra]] (1648\u20131717) accompanied by one small boat's crew and six soldiers. After the establishment of Missions in Alta California after 1769, the Spanish treated Baja California and Alta California as a single administrative unit, part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], with [[Monterey, California]], as its capital.\n\nNearly all the missions in Baja California were established by members of the [[Jesuit]] order supported by a few soldiers. After a power dispute between [[Charles III of Spain]] and the Jesuits, the Jesuit colleges were closed and the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuits were expelled]] from Mexico and South America in 1767 and deported back to Spain. After the forcible expulsion of the Jesuit order, most of the missions were taken over by [[Franciscan]] and later [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars. Both of these groups were under much more direct control of the [[Spanish monarchy]]. This reorganization left many missions abandoned in Sonora Mexico and Baja California.\n\n[[File:Map of California as an island R.W. Seale 1745.jpg|thumb|This 1745 map by British cartographer R.W. Seale misrepresented California as an island.]]\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain and France and their allies (called the [[French and Indian War]] in the British colonies on the East Coast)  (1754\u20131763), France was driven out of North America. Spain and Britain were the only colonial powers left. Britain, as yet, had no Pacific colonies in North America. The Bourbon King [[Charles III of Spain]] established [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and other outposts in [[Alta California]] out of fear that the territory would be claimed by the British, who not only had 13 colonies on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], but also several islands in the Caribbean, and had recently taken over [[Canada under British rule (1763\u20131867)|Canada]] from the French.\n\nOne of Spain's gains from the Seven Years' War was the French [[Louisiana Territory]] which was secretly given to Spain. Another potential colonial power already established in the Pacific was Russia, whose [[Maritime Fur Trade]] of mostly sea otter and fur seals was pressing down from Alaska to the [[Pacific Northwest]]'s lower reaches. These furs could be traded in China for large profits.\n\nThe Spanish settlement of Alta California was the last colonization project to expand Spain's vastly over-extended empire in North America, and they tried to do it with minimal cost and support. Approximately half the cost of settling Alta California was borne by donations and half by funds from the Spanish crown. Massive Indian revolts in [[New Mexico]]'s [[Pueblo Revolt]] among the [[Pueblo Indians]] of the [[Rio Grande]] valley in the 1680s as well as [[Pima Indian Revolt]] in 1751 and the ongoing [[Seri people|Seri]] conflicts in [[Sonora Mexico]] provided the [[Franciscan]] friars with arguments to establish missions with fewer colonial settlers. In particular, the sexual exploitation of Native American women by Spanish soldiers sparked violent reprisals from the Native community and the spread of venereal disease.<ref>Starr, Kevin. ''California: A History''. New York: Modern Library (2005), Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nThe remoteness and isolation of California, the lack of large organized tribes, the lack of agricultural traditions, the absence of any domesticated animals larger than a dog, and a food supply consisting primarily of acorns (unpalatable to most Europeans) meant the missions in California would be very difficult to establish and sustain and made the area unattractive to most potential colonists. A few soldiers and friars financed by the Church and State would form the backbone of the proposed settlement of California.\n\n====Portol\u00e1 expedition (1769\u20131770)====\nIn 1769, the Spanish Visitor General, [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]], planned a [[Portol\u00e0 expedition|five part expedition]], consisting of three units by sea and two by land, to start settling Alta California. [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]] volunteered to command the expedition. The Catholic Church was represented by [[Franciscan]] friar [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] and his fellow friars. All five detachments of soldiers, friars and future colonists were to meet on the shores of San Diego Bay. The first ship, the ''San Carlos'', sailed from [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] on January 10, 1769, and the ''San Antonio'' sailed on February 15. The ''San Antonio'' arrived in San Diego Bay on April 11 and the ''San Carlos'' on April 29. The third vessel, the ''San Jos\u00e9'', left [[New Spain]] later that spring but was lost at sea with no survivors.\n\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Spanish Californias.svg|thumb|155px|Spanish colonial coat of arms for [[the Californias]].]]\n\nThe first land party, led by [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada]], left from the Franciscan [[Misi\u00f3n San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a de Velicat\u00e1|Mission San Fernando Velicata]] on March 24, 1769.

Many Indian neophytes died along the way; even more deserted. The two groups traveling from Lower California on foot had to cross about {{convert|300|mi|km}} of the very dry and rugged [[Baja Peninsula]].\n\nThe part of the expedition that took place over land took about 40\u201351 days to get to San Diego. The contingent coming by sea encountered the south flowing [[California Current]] and strong head winds, and were still straggling in three months after they set sail. After their arduous journeys, most of the men aboard the ships were ill, chiefly from [[scurvy]], and many had died. Out of a total of about 219 men who had left Baja California, little more than 100 survived. The survivors established the [[San Diego Presidio|Presidio of San Diego]] on May 14, 1769. [[Mission San Diego de Alcala]] was established on July 16, 1769. As the first of the presidios and Spanish missions in California, they provided the base of operations for the Spanish colonization of Alta California (present-day California).\n\nOn July 14, 1769, an expedition was dispatched from San Diego to find the port of Monterey. Not recognizing the [[Monterey Bay]] from the description written by [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]]  almost 200 years prior, the expedition traveled beyond it to what is now the [[San Francisco, California]] area. The exploration party, led by Don [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]], arrived on November 2, 1769, at [[San Francisco Bay]].,<ref name=\"Portola\">{{cite web|title=Visitors: San Francisco Historical Information |url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/visitor_index.asp?id=8091 |date=n.d. |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=City and County of San Francisco |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331220353/http://www.sfgov.org/site/visitor_index.asp?id=8091 |archivedate=2008-03-31 }}</ref> One of the greatest ports on the west coast of America had finally been discovered by land.

They subsisted by eating some of their cattle, wild geese, fish, and other food exchanged with the Indians for clothing, but the ravages of scurvy continued because there was then no understanding of the cause or cure of scurvy (a deficiency of vitamin C in fresh food). A small quantity of corn they had planted grew well, only to be eaten by birds. Portol\u00e1 sent Captain Rivera and a small detachment of about 40 men south to the Baja California missions in February to obtain more cattle and a pack-train of supplies.\n\nFewer mouths to feed temporarily eased the drain on San Diego's scant provisions, but within weeks, acute hunger and increased sickness (scurvy) again threatened to force abandonment of the San Diego \"Mission\". Portol\u00e1 finally decided that if no relief ship arrived by March 19, 1770 they would leave to return to the \"[[New Spain]]\" missions on the [[Baja California peninsula|Baja Peninsula]] the next morning ''\"because there were not enough provisions to wait longer and the men had not come to perish from hunger.\"'' At three o'clock in the afternoon on March 19, 1770, as if by a miracle, the sails of the [[sailing ship]]  ''San Antonio'', loaded with relief supplies, were discernible on the horizon. The Spanish settlement of Alta California would continue.\n\n[[File:Juba map.jpg|thumb|Map of the route, Juan Bautista de Anza travelled in 1775-76 from Mexico to today's San Francisco via the Gila River corridor and the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River.]] [[File:Mojave-sonoran deserts.png|thumb|Mojave and Sonoran deserts block easy land travel to California.

The friendly [[Quechan]] (Yuma) Indians (2-3,000) he encountered there were growing most of their food, using irrigation systems, and had already imported pottery, horses, wheat and a few other crops from [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"Guerro, Vladimir 2006\">Guerro, Vladimir; ''The Anza Trail: The Settling of California''; Heyday Books; (2006); {{ISBN|978-1-59714-026-3}}</ref>\n\nAfter crossing the Colorado to avoid the impassable [[Algodones Dunes]] west of [[Yuma, Arizona]], they followed the river about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south (to about the Arizona's southwest corner on the Colorado River)  before turning northwest to about today's [[Mexicali, Mexico]] and then turning north through today's [[Imperial Valley]] and then northwest again before reaching [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]] near the future city of [[Los Angeles, California]]. It took Anza about 74 days to do this initial reconnaissance trip to establish a land route into California. On his return trip he went down the [[Gila River]] until hitting the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)]] and continuing on to Tubac. The return trip only took 23 days, and he encountered several peaceful and  populous agricultural tribes with irrigation systems located along the Gila River.<ref name=\"Guerro, Vladimir 2006\"/>\n\nIn Anza's second trip (1775\u20131776) he returned  to California with 240 friars, soldiers and colonists with their families. They took 695 horses and mules, 385 [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] bulls and cows with them. The approximately 200 surviving cattle and an unknown number of horses (many of each were lost or eaten along the way) started the cattle and horse raising industry in California. In California the cattle and horses had few enemies and plentiful grass in all but drought years. They essentially grew and multiplied as feral animals, doubling roughly every two years. The party started from Tubac, Arizona, on October 22, 1775 and arrived at [[San Francisco Bay]] on March 28, 1776. There they established the [[Presidio of San Francisco]], followed by a [[mission (station)|mission]], [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (Mission Dolores) --the future city of [[San Francisco]].\n\nIn 1780, the Spanish established two combination missions and pueblos at the Yuma Crossing: [[Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu\u00f1er]] and [[Mission Puerto de Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]]. Both these pueblos and missions were on the California side of the Colorado River but were administered by the Arizona authorities. On July 17\u201318, 1781 the Yuma ([[Quechan]]) Indians, in a dispute with the Spanish, destroyed both missions and pueblos\u2014killing 103 soldiers, colonists, and Friars and capturing about 80 prisoners, mostly women and children. In four well-supported punitive expeditions in 1782 and 1783 against the Quechans, the Spanish managed to gather their dead and ransom nearly all the prisoners, but failed to re-open the Anza Trail. The [[Yuma Crossing]] was closed for Spanish traffic and it would stay closed until about 1846. California was nearly isolated again from land based travel. About the only way into California from Mexico would now be a 40- to 60-day voyage by sea. The average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824 meant that additional colonists coming to Alta California were few and far between.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hb75yap6.htm|title=San Francisco History - Seventy-five Years in San Francisco, Appendix N.

The missions were nearly all located within {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the coast and almost no exploration or settlements were made in the [[Central Valley (California)]] or the [[Sierra Nevada (California)]]. The only expeditions anywhere close to the Central Valley and Sierras were the rare forays by soldiers undertaken to recover runaway Indians who had escaped from the Missions. The \"settled\" territory of about 15,000 square miles (40,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) was about 10% of California's eventual 156,000 square miles (400,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) territory.\n\nIn 1786, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de La P\u00e9rouse]] led a group of scientists and artists who compiled an account of the Californian mission system, the land, and the people. Traders, whalers, and scientific missions followed in the next decades.\n\n====California Mission network====\nThe [[California Missions]], after they were all established, were located about one day's horseback ride apart for easier communication and linked by the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real trail]]. These Missions were typically manned by two to three friars and three to ten soldiers. Virtually all the physical work was done by  indigenous people convinced to or coerced into joining the missions. The padres provided instructions for making adobe bricks, building mission buildings, planting fields, digging irrigation ditches, growing new grains and vegetables, herding cattle and horses, singing, speaking Spanish, and understanding the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith\u2014all that was thought to be necessary to bring the Indians to be able to support themselves and their new church.\n\nThe soldiers supervised the construction of the Presidios (forts) and were responsible for keeping order and preventing and/or capturing runaway Indians that tried to leave the missions. Nearly all of the Indians adjoining the missions were induced to join the various missions built in California. Once the Indians had joined the mission, if they tried to leave, soldiers were sent out to retrieve them. In the 1830s, [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] observed that Indians were regarded and treated as slaves by the Spanish-speaking [[Californio]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dana |first=Richard Henry |authorlink=Richard Henry Dana, Jr. |title=Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea |publisher=Harper & Brothers |year=1842 |location=New York |pages=93, 97, 209\u2013210}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mission San Luis Rey de Francia courtyard.jpg|thumb|250px|The courtyard of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, with California's oldest pepper tree (''[[Peruvian pepper|Schinus molle]]''), planted in 1830, visible through the arch.<ref>Young, p. 18</ref>]]\n\nThe missions eventually claimed about 1/6 of the available land in California or roughly {{convert|1000000|acre|km2|0}} of land per mission. The rest of the land was considered the property of the [[Spanish monarchy]]. To encourage settlement of the territory, large land grants were given to retired soldiers and colonists. Most grants were virtually free and typically went to friends and relatives in the California government. A few foreign colonists were accepted if they accepted Spanish citizenship and joined the Catholic Faith. The [[Mexican Inquisition]] was still in nearly full force and forbade Protestants living in Mexican controlled territory. In the Spanish colonial period many of these grants were later turned into [[Ranchos of California|Ranchos]].\n\nSpain made about 30 of these large grants, nearly all several square leagues (1 Spanish league = {{convert|2.6|mi|km}}) each in size. The total land granted to settlers in the Spanish colonial era was about {{convert|800000|acre|km2|0}} or about {{convert|35000|acre|km2|0}} each. The few owners of these large ranchos patterned themselves after the landed gentry in Spain and were devoted to keeping themselves living in a grand style. The rest of the population they expected to support them. Their mostly unpaid workers were nearly all Spanish trained Indians or [[peons]] that had learned how to ride horses and raise some crops. The majority of the ranch hands were paid with room and board, rough clothing, rough housing and no salary.\n\nThe main products of these ranchos were cattle, horses and sheep, most of which lived virtually wild. The cattle were mostly killed for fresh meat, as well as hides and tallow (fat) which could be traded or sold for money or goods. As the [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|cattle]] herds increased there came a time when nearly everything that could be made of leather was\u2014doors, window coverings, stools, [[chaps]], leggings, vests lariats ([[riata]])s, [[saddle]]s, boots  etc. Since there was no refrigeration then, often a cow was killed for the day's fresh meat and the hide and tallow salvaged for sale later. After taking the cattle's hide and tallow their carcasses were left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s which roamed wild in California at that time, or to feed the packs of dogs that typically lived at each rancho.\n\nA series of four ''presidios'', or \"royal forts\", each manned by 10 to 100 men, were built by Spain in Alta California. California installations were established in [[San Diego]] ([[Presidio of San Diego|El Presidio Real de San Diego]]) founded in 1769, in San Francisco ([[Presidio of San Francisco|El Presidio Real de San Francisco]]) founded in 1776, and in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] ([[Presidio of Santa Barbara|El Presidio Real de Santa B\u00e1rbara]]) founded in 1782. After the Spanish colonial era the [[Presidio of Sonoma]] in [[Sonoma, California]] was founded in 1834.<ref>(For the [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Revillagigedo]] Census of 1790 listing the inhabitants of Monterey and the other presidios and pueblos, see [http://sfgenealogy.com/spanish/cen1790.htm The Census of 1790, California], California Spanish Genealogy.

The pueblos of [[History of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]], [[History of San Diego|San Diego]], [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]], [[History of Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Villa de Branciforte]] (later abandoned before later becoming [[Santa Cruz, California]]) and the pueblo of [[History of San Jose, California|San Jose, California]] were all established to support the [[Spanish Missions of California|Missions]] and presidios in California. These were the only towns (pueblos) in California.\n\n===Mexican period (1821 to 1846)===\n[[File:Mexico 1824 (equirectangular projection).png|thumb|230px|[[First Mexican Republic|Mexico]] in 1824. [[Alta California]] is the northwestern-most country.]]\n\nIn 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain. Alta California became a territory rather than a full state. The territorial capital remained in [[Monterey, California]], with a governor as executive official.\n\nMexico, after independence, was unstable with about [[List of heads of state of Mexico|40 changes of government]], in the 27 years prior to 1848\u2014an average government duration was 7.9 months. In Alta California, Mexico inherited a large, sparsely settled, poor, backwater province paying little or no net tax revenue to the Mexican state. In addition, Alta California had a declining Mission system as the [[Spanish Missions of California|Mission]] Indian population in Alta California continued to rapidly decrease.\n\nThe number of Alta California settlers, always a minority of total population, slowly increased mostly by more births than deaths in the Californio population in California. After the closure of the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail|de Anza Trail]] across the [[Colorado River]] in 1781 immigration from Mexico was nearly all by ship. California continued to be a sparsely populated and isolated country.\n\n====Trade policy====\nEven before Mexico gained control of [[Alta California]] the onerous Spanish rules against trading with foreigners began to break down as the declining Spanish fleet could not enforce their no-trading policies. The settlers, and their descendants (who became known as [[Californio]]s), were eager to trade for new commodities, finished goods, luxury goods, and other merchandise. The Mexican government abolished the no trade with foreign ships policy and soon regular trading trips were being made.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, a number of Europeans and Americans became naturalized Mexican citizens and settled in early California. Some of those became rancheros and traders during the Mexican period, such as [[Abel Stearns]].\n\n[[California hide trade|Cattle hides and tallow]], along with [[North American fur trade|marine mammal fur]] and other goods, provided the necessary trade articles for mutually beneficial trade. The first American, English, and Russian [[California hide trade|trading ships]] first appeared in California a few years before 1820. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] provides a good first hand account of this trade. From 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year\u2014a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/>\n\nThe main [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|port of entry]] for trading purposes was Monterey, where custom duties of up to 100% (also called [[tariffs]]) were applied. These high duties gave rise to much bribery and smuggling, as avoiding the tariffs made more money for the ship owners and made the goods less costly to the customers. Essentially all the cost of the California government (what little there was) was paid for by these tariffs. In this they were much like the United States in 1850, where about 89% of the revenue of its federal government came from import tariffs, although at an average rate of about 20%.<ref name=\"usgovernmentrevenue.com\">{{cite web|url=http://usgovernmentrevenue.com/index.php?year=1850#usgs302a|title=US Government Revenue, Deficit and Debt - Numbers Charts Analysis History|website=usgovernmentrevenue.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Mexico and the mission system====\nSo many mission Indians died from exposure to harsh conditions and diseases like measles, diphtheria, smallpox, syphilis, etc. that at times raids were undertaken to new villages in the interior to supplement the supply of Indian women. This increase in deaths was accompanied by a very low live birth rate among the surviving Indian population. As reported by Krell, as  of December 31, 1832, the mission [[Franciscan]] ''padres'' had performed a combined total of 87,787 baptisms and 24,529 marriages, and recorded 63,789 deaths.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\">Krell, Dorothy (ed.) (1979). ''The California Missions: A Pictorial History''; p. 316; Sunset Publishing Corporation, Menlo Park, California. {{ISBN|0-376-05172-8}}</ref>\n\nIf Krell's numbers are to be believed (others have very different numbers) the Mission Indian population had declined from a peak of about 87,000 in about 1800 to about 14,000 in 1832 and continued to decline. The Missions were becoming ever more strained as the number of Indian converts drastically declined and the deaths greatly exceeded the births. The ratio of Indian births to deaths is believed to have been less than 0.5 Indian births per death.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/>\n\nThe missions, as originally envisioned, were to last only about ten years before being converted to ''regular'' parishes. When the California missions were abolished in 1834 some [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] had existed over 66 years but the [[Spanish missions in California|Mission]] Indians were still not self-sufficient, proficient in Spanish, or wholly Catholic. Taking people from a hunter-gatherer type existence to an educated, agricultural-based existence was much more difficult than the missionaries had originally thought. The severe and continuing decline in Mission Indian populations exacerbated this problem. In 1834 Mexico, in response to demands that the Catholic Church give up much of the Mission property, started the process of [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularizing]] the [[Franciscan]] run [[Spanish missions in California|missions]]. [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] was the very first to feel the effects of this legislation the following year when, on August 9, 1834 Governor Figueroa issued his \"Decree of Confiscation.\"<ref>Engelhardt, Zephyrin, O.F.M. (1922); ''San Juan Capistrano Mission'', p. 114, Standard Printing Co., Los Angeles, California</ref>\n\nNine other missions quickly followed, with six more in 1835; [[Mission San Buenaventura|San Buenaventura]] and San Francisco de As\u00eds were among the last to succumb, in June and December 1836, respectively.<ref>Yenne, Bill (2004). ''The Missions of California'', pp. 83, 93, Advantage Publishers Group, San Diego, California. {{ISBN|1-59223-319-8}}</ref> The [[Franciscan]]s soon thereafter abandoned most of the missions, taking with them almost everything of value they could, after which the locals typically plundered the mission buildings for construction materials, furniture, etc. or the mission buildings were sold off to serve other uses.\n\nIn spite of this neglect, the Indian towns at [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|San Juan Capistrano]], [[San Dieguito Complex|San Dieguito]], and [[Las Flores Estancia|Las Flores]] did continue on for some time under a provision in Governor Echeand\u00eda's 1826 Proclamation that allowed for the partial conversion of missions to new ''pueblos''.<ref>Robinson, W.W. (1948); ''Land in California'', p. 42, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California</ref> After the secularizing of the Missions, many of the surviving Mission Indians switched from being unpaid workers for the missions to unpaid laborers and vaqueros (cowboys) of the about 500 large Californio owned [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]].\n\n====Land grants====\nBefore Alta California became a part of the Mexican state, about 30 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]] to Presidio soldiers and government officials and a few friends and family of the Alta California Governors, some of whom were grandchildren of the original 1775 Anza expedition settlers. The 1824 Mexican Colony Law established rules for petitioning for land grants in California; and by 1828, the rules for establishing land grants were codified in the Mexican Reglamento (Regulation). The Acts sought to break the monopoly of the Franciscan missions, while paving the way for additional settlers to California by making land grants easier to obtain.\n\nWhen the missions were secularized, the mission property and cattle were supposed to be mostly allocated to the missions Indians. In practice, nearly all mission property and livestock were taken over by the about 455 large [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] granted by the governors\u2014mostly to friends and family at low or no cost. The rancho owners claimed about {{convert|8600000|acre|km2}} averaging about {{convert|18900|acre|km2}} each. This land was nearly all distributed on former mission land within about {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the coast.\n\nThe Mexican land grants were provisional until settled and worked on for five years, and often had very  indefinite boundaries and sometimes conflicting ownership claims. The boundaries of each rancho were almost never surveyed, and marked, and often depended on local landmarks that often changed over time. Since the government depended on import tariffs for its income, there was virtually no property tax\u2014the property tax when introduced with U.S. statehood was a big shock. The grantee could not subdivide, or rent out, the land without approval.\n\nThe rancho owners tried to live in a grand manner, and the result was similar to a [[feudal barony|barony]]. For these few rancho owners and families, this was  California's Golden Age; for the vast majority it was not golden. Much of the agriculture, vineyards, and orchards established by the Missions were allowed to deteriorate as the rapidly declining Mission Indian population required less food, and the Missionaries and soldiers supporting the Missions disappeared. The new Ranchos and slowly increasing Pueblos mostly only grew enough food to eat and to trade with the occasional trading ship or [[Whaling in the United States|whaler]] that put into a California port to trade, get fresh water, replenish their firewood and obtain fresh vegetables.\n\nThe main products of these ranchos were [[leather|cattle hides]] (called California greenbacks) and [[tallow]] (rendered fat for making candles and soap) that were traded for other finished goods and merchandise. This hide-and-tallow trade was mainly carried on by Boston-based ships that traveled {{convert|14000|mi|km}} to {{convert|18000|mi|km}} around [[Cape Horn]] to bring finished goods and merchandise to trade with the Californio Ranchos for their hides and tallow. The cattle and horses that provided the hides and tallow essentially grew wild.\n\nBy 1845, the province of Alta California had a non-native population of about 1,500 Spanish and Latin American-born adult men along with about 6,500 women and their native-born children (who became the Californios). These Spanish-speakers lived mostly in the southern half of the state from San Diego north to Santa Barbara.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} There were also around 1300 American immigrants and 500 European immigrants from a wide variety of backgrounds. Nearly all of these were adult males and a majority lived in central and northern California from Monterey north to Sonoma and east to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] foothills.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nA large non-coastal land grant was given to [[John Sutter]] who, in 1839, settled a large land grant close to the future city of [[Sacramento, California]], which he called \"[[New Helvetia]]\" (''New Switzerland''). There, he built an extensive fort equipped with much of the armament from [[Fort Ross]]\u2014bought from the Russians on credit when they abandoned that fort. [[Sutter's Fort]] was the first non-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] community in the California [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. Sutter's Fort, from 1839 to about 1848, was a major agricultural and trade colony in California, often welcoming and assisting [[California Trail]] travelers to California. Most of the settlers at, or near, Sutter's Fort were new immigrants from the United States.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://linecamp.com/museums/americanwest/western_names/sutter_john/sutter_john.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508055153/http://linecamp.com/museums/americanwest/western_names/sutter_john/sutter_john.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=1999-05-08 | title=John Sutter, Sutters Fort}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=485|title=Sutter''s Fort SHP|first=California State Parks, State of|last=California|website=CA State Parks|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\n====Annexation of California (1846\u20131847)====\n{{main|Conquest of California|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n<!--As I commented at the new article \"Conquest of California\", I have a problem with this wording. \"Conquest of California\" seems very non-neutral.

Several battles between U.S. and Mexican troops led the United States Congress to issue a declaration of war against Mexico on May 13, 1846; the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] had begun. Word of the conflict reached Alta California about a month later.\n\nThe main forces available to the United States in California were the bluejacket sailors and U.S. Marines on board the ships of the [[Pacific Squadron]]. Speculating that war with Mexico over Texas and other land was very possible, the [[U.S. Navy]] had sent several additional naval vessels to the Pacific in 1845 to protect U.S. interests there. It took about 200 days, on average, for ships to travel the greater than {{convert|17000|mi|km|adj=on}} trip from the East coast around [[Cape Horn]] of South America to California.\n\nInitially as the war with Mexico started there were five vessels in the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron near California. In 1846 and 1847 this was increased to 13 Navy vessels\u2014over half the U.S. Navy's available ships. The only other U.S. military force then in California was the about 30 military topographers etc. and 30 mountain men, guides, hunters, etc. in Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]]'s [[Corps of Topographical Engineers|United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]] exploratory force. They were exiting California on their way to what is now [[Oregon]] when they got word in early June 1846 that war was imminent and a revolt had already started in [[Sonoma, California]]. Hearing rumors of possible Californio military action against the newly arrived settlers in California (this had already happened in 1840),<ref>Cleland, Robert Glass; ''A History of California'', The Macmillan Company 1922, p. 191 (Google eBook)</ref> some settlers decided to neutralize the small Californio garrison at Sonoma, California. On June 15, 1846, some thirty settlers, mostly American citizens, staged a revolt and seized the small Californio garrison, in Sonoma, without firing a shot and declared the new [[California Republic]] government. On hearing of this revolt, Fremont and his exploratory force returned to California. The \"republic\" never exercised any real authority and only lasted 26 days before accepting U.S. government control.\n\nThe former fleet surgeon William M. Wood and  John Parrot, the American Consul of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]], arrived in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico on May 10, 1846. There they heard word of the ongoing hostilities between the U.S. and Mexico forces and sent a message by special courier back to Commodore ([[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]]) [[John D. Sloat]], commander of the [[Pacific Squadron]] then visiting Mazatl\u00e1n Mexico. On May 17, 1846, this courier's  messages informed Commodore Sloat that hostilities between the U.S. and Mexico had commenced.<ref>Bancroft, Hubert H.; ''History of California'' Vol. XXII 1846\u20131848, p. 201, The History Company Publishers, San Francisco, 1882 (Google eBook)</ref>\n\nCommodore (Rear Admiral) John D.

They joined the sloop {{USS|Cyane|1837|2}} which was already there.<ref>Cleland, Robert Glass; ''The History of California'', p. 205, The Macmillan Company New York, 1922 (Google eBook)</ref> There were U.S. fears that the British might try to annex California to satisfy British creditors.<ref>Cleland, Robert Glass; ''The History of California'', p. 180, The Macmillan Company New York, 1922 (Google eBook)</ref> The British [[Pacific Station]]'s squadron of ships off California were stronger in ships, guns, and men than the American ships.<ref name=\"Bancroft, Hubert H. p. 199\"/> Apparently the British never had any orders on whether to interfere or not if hostilities broke out between The Californios and the United States and requesting new orders would have taken from one and a half and two years to get a message to England and back.\n\nInitially there was little resistance from anyone in California as they replaced the dysfunctional and ineffective Mexican government which had already been replaced by the Californios. The Mexican government by 1846 had already had 40 [[List of heads of state of Mexico|presidents]] in the first 24 years of its existence. Most new settlers and Californios were neutral or actively supported the revolt. An independent group of men called \"Los Osos\" raised the \"[[Bear Flag]]\" of the [[California Republic]] over Sonoma. The republic was in existence scarcely more than 25 days before Fr\u00e9mont returned and took over on June 23 from [[William B. Ide]] the leader of the [[Bear Flag Revolt]]. The California state flag of today is based on this original Bear Flag and still contains the words \"California Republic.\"[[John A. Sutter]] and his men and supplies at Sutter's Fort joined the revolt.\n\n====US capture of coastal ports and towns====\nIn 1846, the U.S. Navy was under orders to take over all California ports in the event of war. There were about 400 to 500 [[U.S. Marines]] and U.S. Navy bluejacket sailors available for possible land action on the Pacific Squadron's ships. Hearing word of the Bear Flag Revolt in Sonoma, California, and the arrival of the large British 2,600-ton, 600-man man-of-war {{HMS|Collingwood|1841|6}} flagship under Sir George S. Seymour, outside Monterey Harbor, Commodore Sloat was finally stirred to action. On July 7, 1846, seven weeks after war had been declared, Sloat instructed the captains of the ships {{USS|Savannah|1842|6}} and [[sloops-of-war|sloops]] {{USS|Cyane|1837|2}} and {{USS|Levant|1837|2}} of the [[Pacific Squadron]] in [[Monterey Bay]] to occupy [[Battle of Monterey|Monterey, California]]\u2014the Alta California capital. Fifty American marines and about 100 bluejacket sailors landed and captured the city without incident\u2014the few Californio troops formerly there having already evacuated the city. They raised the flag of the United States without firing a shot. The only shots fired were a 21-gun salute to the new U.S. flag fired by each of the U.S. Navy ships in the harbor.<ref>Bancroft, Hubert H.; ''History of California'' Vol. XXII 1846-1848, p. 252, The History Company Publishers, San Francisco, 1882 (Google eBook)</ref> The British ships observed but took no action.\n\nThe abandoned [[Presidio]] and [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (Mission Dolores) at San Francisco, then called [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]], were occupied without firing a shot on July 9, 1846, by U.S. marines and U.S. Navy sailors from the [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}}. Militia Captain [[Thomas Fallon]] led a small force of about 22 men from [[Santa Cruz, California]], and captured the small town of [[History of San Jose, California|Pueblo de San Jose]] without bloodshed on July 11, 1846. Fallon received an American flag from Commodore John D. Sloat and raised it over the pueblo on July 14. On July 15, 1846, Commodore ([[Rear Admiral]]) Sloat transferred his command of the Pacific Squadron to Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] when Stockton's ship, the frigate {{USS|Congress|1841|6}}, arrived from the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] (Hawaii).\n\nStockton, a much more aggressive leader, asked Fremont to form a joint force of Fremont's soldiers, scouts, guides, and others, and a volunteer militia\u2014many who were former Bear Flag Revolters. This unit, called the [[California Battalion]], was mustered into U.S. service and were paid regular army wages. On July 19, Fr\u00e9mont's newly formed \"California Battalion\" swelled to about 160 men. These men included Fremont's 30 topographical men and their 30 scouts and hunters, U.S. Marine Lieutenant [[Archibald H. Gillespie]], a U.S. Navy officer to handle their two [[cannon]]s, a company of Indians trained by Sutter and many other ''permanent'' California settlers from several different countries as well as American settlers. The California Battalion members were used mainly to garrison and keep order in the rapidly surrendering California towns.\n\nThe Navy went down the coast from San Francisco, occupying ports without resistance as they went. The small pueblo (town) of [[History of San Diego|San Diego]] surrendered 29 July 1846 without a shot being fired. The small pueblo (town) of [[History of Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]] surrendered without a shot being fired in August 1846.\n\n====Taking of Los Angeles====\nOn August 13, 1846, a joint force of U.S. Marines, bluejacket sailors and parts of Fr\u00e9mont's California Battalion carried by the {{USS|Cyane|1837|6}} entered Pueblo de Los Angeles, California with flags flying and band playing. USMC Captain Archibald H. Gillespie, (Fr\u00e9mont's second in command of the [[California Battalion]]), with an inadequate force of 40 to 50 men, were left to occupy and keep order in the largest town (about 3,500) in Alta California\u2014Los Angeles. The Californio government officials had already fled Alta California.\n\nIn September 1846 the Californios  [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Flores]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Carrillo]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]], organized and led a campaign of resistance against the American incursion into Los Angeles of the prior month.  As a result, the outnumbered United States troops evacuated the city for the following few months.  Over the following four months, U.S. forces fought minor skirmishes with the Californio Lancers in the [[Battle of San Pasqual|Battle of San Pasqual (in San Diego, California)]], the [[Battle of Dominguez Rancho|Battle of Dominguez Rancho (near Los Angeles)]], and the [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel|Battle of Rio San Gabriel (near Los Angeles)]]. After the Los Angeles resistance started, the American California Battalion was expanded to a force of about 400 men.\n\nIn early January 1847, a 600-man joint force of U.S. Marine, U.S. Navy bluejacket sailors, General [[Stephen W. Kearny]]'s 80 [[U.S. Army]] dragoons (cavalrymen), who had arrived over the Gila river trail in December 1846, and about two companies of Fremont's California Battalion re-occupied Los Angeles after some very minor skirmishes (mostly posturing)\u2014four months after the initial American retreat, the same U.S. flag again flew over Los Angeles. The minor armed resistance in California ceased when the Californios signed the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] on January 13, 1847. About 150 Californios who were worried about possible punishment from the Americans for not keeping their non-aggression promises rounded up about 300 horses and retreated into Sonora, Mexico over the [[Yuma Crossing]] [[Gila River]] trail. The Californios, who had wrested control of California from Mexico in 1845, now had a new and much more stable government.<ref name=\"calrepublic.tripod.com\">{{cite web|url=http://calrepublic.tripod.com/history.html|title=History of California including the Indians, Spanish, Californio, Bear Flag Republic, United States, and their flags.|website=Calrepublic.tripod.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed in early 1847, the [[Pacific Squadron]] then went on to capture all [[Baja California]] cities and harbors and sink or capture all the [[Pacific Naval Force|Mexican Pacific Navy]] they could find. Baja California was returned to Mexico in subsequent [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] negotiations. California was under U.S. control by January 1847 and formally annexed and paid for by the U.S. in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] signed in 1848.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/americanhistory/hsus/reviews.htm|title=Home|website=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021135741/http://www.cambridge.org/us/americanhistory/hsus/reviews.htm|archive-date=2012-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Reinforcements arrive====\nAfter hostilities had ceased with the signing of the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] on January 13, 1847, on January 22, 1847 Commodore Stockton's replacement, Commodore William B. Shubrick, showed up in Monterey in the [[razee]] {{USS|Independence|1814|6}} with 54 guns and about 500 crew members. On January 27, 1847 the transport ''Lexington'' showed up in Monterey, California with a regular [[U.S. Army]] [[artillery]] company of 113 men under Captain Christopher Tompkins.<ref>Harlow, Neal; ''California Conquered'', p. 247, University of California Press; 1989; {{ISBN|978-0-520-06605-2}}</ref>\n\nMore reinforcements of about 320 soldiers (and a few women) of the [[Mormon Battalion]] arrived at [[San Diego]] on January 28, 1847\u2014after hostilities had ceased. They had been recruited from the [[Mormon]] camps on the [[Missouri River]]\u2014about {{convert|2000|mi|km}} away. These troops were recruited with the understanding they would be discharged in California with their weapons. Most were discharged before July 1847. More reinforcements in the form of Colonel [[Jonathan D. Stevenson]]'s [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]] of about 648 men showed up in March\u2013April 1847\u2014again after hostilities had ceased. After desertions and deaths in transit, four ships brought Stevenson's 648 men to California. Initially they took over all of the Pacific Squadron's on-shore military and garrison duties and the Mormon Battalion and California Battalion's garrison duties.\n\nThe New York Volunteer companies were deployed from San Francisco in Alta California to [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz, Mexico]] in Baja California. The ship ''Isabella'' sailed from Philadelphia on 16 August 1847, with a detachment of one hundred soldiers, and arrived in California on 18 February 1848, the following year, at about the same time that the ship ''Sweden'' arrived with another detachment of soldiers. These soldiers were added to the existing companies of Stevenson's [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]]. Stevenson's troops were recruited with the understanding that they would be discharged in California. When gold was discovered in late January 1848, many of Stevenson's troops deserted.\n\nThe U.S. 1850 California Census asks state of birth of all residents and finds about 7300 residents that were born in California. The San Francisco, Contra Costa and Santa Clara county U.S. censuses were lost or burned in one of San Francisco's many fires. Adding the approximate 200 Hispanics in San Francisco (1846 directory) and an unknown (but small as shown in 1852 CA Census recount) number of Hispanics in Contra Costa and Santa Clara county in 1846 gives less than 8,000 Hispanics statewide in 1846 before hostilities commenced. The number of California Indians is unknown since they were not included in the 1850 census but has been roughly estimated to be between 50,000 and 150,000.\n\n====Military governor====\nAfter 1847, California was controlled (with much difficulty due to desertions) by a U.S. Army-appointed military governor and an inadequate force of a little over 600 troops. By 1850, California had grown to have a non-Indian and non-Californio population of over 100,000 due to the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>U.S. 1850 California Census counts 92,597 residents but omits the residents of San Francisco (estimated at about 21,000) whose census records were destroyed by fire. Contra Costa County (estimated at about 2,000 residents) and Santa Clara County (estimated at about 4,000 residents) 1850 records were \"lost\" and also not included. The total non-Indian (Indians were not counted) population was over 120,000. See: \"Historical Statistical Abstracts - U.S. Census Bureau\"; [www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html]</ref> Despite a major conflict in the U.S. Congress on the number of slave versus non-slave states, the large, rapid and continuing California population gains and the large amount of gold being exported east gave California enough clout to choose its own boundaries, select its representatives, write its Constitution, and be admitted to the Union as a free state in 1850 without going through territorial status as required for most other states.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] formally ended the Mexican\u2013American War in February 1848. For $15,000,000, and the assumption of U.S. debt claims against Mexico, the new state of Texas's boundary claims were settled, and [[New Mexico]], California, and the unsettled territory of several future states of the American Southwest were added to U.S. control.\n\nFrom 1847 to 1850, California had military governors appointed by the senior military commander in California. This arrangement was distinctly unsettling to the military, as they had no inclination, precedent, or training for setting up and running a government. President [[James K. Polk]] in office from March 4, 1845 \u2013 March 4, 1849, tried to get the 1848 Congress to make California a territory with a territorial government and again in 1849 but was unsuccessful in getting Congress to agree on the specifics of how this was to be done\u2014the issue was the number of free states vs. slave states.<ref>California and New Mexico: Message from the President of the United States.

Riley]] who had fought in the [[Siege of Veracruz]] and [[Chapultepec]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and considered an able military commander, was the last military governor of California in 1849\u20131850. In response to popular demand for a better more representative government, General Riley issued an official proclamation dated June 3, 1849, calling for a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] and an election of  representatives on August 1, 1849.\n[[File:Colton Hall.JPG|thumb|[[Colton Hall]] in Monterey, site of California's 1849 [[Constitutional Convention (California)|Constitutional Convention]]]]\n\n==== California Constitutional Convention (1849) ====\nConvention delegates were chosen by secret ballot but lacking any census data as to California's population and where they lived its representatives only roughly approximated the rapidly changing state population as later shown in the 1850 U.S. California Census taken a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229215830/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 December 2004|title=Statistical Abstracts|date=29 December 2004|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> The 48 delegates chosen were mostly pre-1846 American settlers; eight were native born Californios who had to use interpreters.

There were four other significant differences from the U.S. Constitution. The [[California Constitution|convention]] chose the boundaries for the state\u2014unlike most other territories, whose boundaries were set by Congress (Article XII). Article IX encouraged statewide education and provided for a system of common schools partially funded by the state and provided for the establishment of a University (University of California). The California version outlawed slavery, except as punishment (Article I Sec. 18) and dueling (Article XI Sec.2) and gave women and wives the right to own and control their own property (Article XI Sec. 14).\n\nThe [[debt limit]] for the state was set at $300,000 (Article VIII). Like all other states they guaranteed the rights of citizens to sue in Civil court to uphold the rights of contracts and property (Article I Sec. 16). They created a court system with a supreme court with judges who had to be confirmed every 12 years.(Article VI) They set up the states original 29 counties (Article I Sec. 4), created a legislature of two houses, set up polling places to vote, set up uniform taxation rules. The 1849 Constitution guaranteed the right to vote to \"Every citizen of California, declared a legal voter by this Constitution, and every citizen of the United States, a resident of this State on the day of election, shall be entitled to vote at the first general election under this Constitution, and on the question of the adoption thereof (Article XII Sec. 5)\".<ref name=\"Richard B.

Almost all (~96%) were young men. [[Women in the California Gold Rush]] were few and had many opportunities to do new things and take on new tasks. [[Argonauts]], as they were often called, walked over the [[California Trail]] or came by sea. About 80,000 Argonauts arrived in 1849 alone\u2014about 40,000 over the California trail and 40,000 by sea.\n\nSan Francisco was designated the official [[port of entry]] for all California ports where U.S. customs (also called [[tariffs]] and [[Ad valorem tax]]es) (averaging about 25%) were collected by the Collector of Customs from all ships bearing foreign goods. The first Collector of customs was Edward H. Harrison, appointed by General Kearny. Shipping boomed from the average of about 25 vessels from 1825 to 1847<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/> to about 793 ships in 1849 and 803 ships in 1850.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/inport/1849.htm|title=1849.

Passengers disembarking in San Francisco had one of the easier accesses to the gold country since they could take another ship from there to get to Sacramento and several other towns.\n\nSan Francisco shipping boomed, and wharves and piers had to be developed to handle the onslaught of cargo--''Long Wharf'' was probably the most prominent. To meet the demands of the Gold Rush, ships bearing food, liquors of many types, tools, hardware, clothing, complete houses, lumber, building materials, etc. as well as farmers, entrepreneurs, prospective miners, gamblers, entertainers and [[Women in the California Gold Rush|prostitutes]], etc. from around the world came to San Francisco.

The Californios initially prospered, as there was a sudden increase in the demand for livestock. These food shipments changed mainly to shipments from Oregon and internal shipments in California as agriculture was developed in both states.\n\nStarting in 1849, many of the ship crews jumped ship and headed for the gold fields when they reached port. Soon [[San Francisco Bay]] had many hundreds of abandoned ships anchored offshore. The better ships were recrewed and put back in the shipping and passenger business. Others were bought ''cheap'' and hauled up on the mud flats and used as [[store ship]]s, saloons, temporary stores, floating warehouses, homes, and a number of other uses. Many of these repurposed ships were partially destroyed in one of San Francisco's many fires and ended up as landfill to expand the available land.

About half the Argonauts to California came by wagon on one of these routes.\n\n====Gold Rush effects====\nStarting in 1848 before gold in California was even confirmed, Congress had contracted with the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] to set up regular [[paddle steamer]] [[packet ship]], mail, passenger and cargo routes in the Pacific Ocean. This was to be a regular route from [[Panama]], [[Nicaragua]] and Mexico to and from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Oregon|Oregon]]. The Atlantic Ocean mail contract from East Coast cities and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to and from the [[Chagres River]] in [[Panama]] was won by the [[United States Mail Steamship Company]] whose first steamship, the ''SS Falcon (1848')'' was dispatched on December 1, 1848. The [[SS California (1848)]], the first [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] [[steamship]], showed up in San Francisco loaded with gold seekers on February 28, 1849 on its first trip from Panama and Mexico after steaming around [[Cape Horn]] from [[History of New York (state)|New York]]. Once the [[California Gold Rush]] was confirmed, other paddle steamers soon followed on both the Pacific and Atlantic routes. By late 1849 [[paddle steamer]]s like the ''SS McKim (1848)''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/ships/ss.html|title=Page moved. Automatic redirect.|website=Maritimeheritage.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> were carrying miners and business men over the {{convert|125|mi|km}} trip from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] up the [[Sacramento River]] to [[History of Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Marysville, California]]. Steam powered [[tugboat]]s started working in the [[San Francisco Bay]] soon after this.\n\nAgriculture expanded throughout the state to meet the food needs of the new settlers. Agriculture was soon found to be limited by the difficulty of finding enough water in the right places to grow irrigated crops. Winter wheat planted in the fall and harvested in the spring was one early crop that grew well without irrigation. At the beginning of the Gold Rush, there was no written law regarding property rights in the goldfields, and a system of \"staking claims\" was developed by the miners. The Gold Rush also had negative effects: [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were pushed off of traditional lands and massacred<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2016/08/26/california-native-americans-genocide-490824.html|title=California's state-sanctioned genocide of Native Americans|date=17 August 2016|website=Newsweek.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> and [[gold mining]] caused environmental harm.\n\nIn the early years of the California Gold Rush, [[placer mining]] methods were used, from panning to \"cradles\" and \"rockers\" or \"long-toms\", to diverting the water from an entire river into a [[sluice]] alongside the river, and then digging for gold in the gravel down to the rocky river bottom. This placer gold had been freed by the slow disintegration, over geological time, that freed the gold from its ore. This free gold was typically found in the cracks in the rocks found at the bottom of the gravel found in rivers or creeks, as the gold typically worked down through the gravel or collected in stream bends or bottom cracks. Some 12-million ounces<ref>The [[Troy weight]] system is traditionally used to measure precious metals, not the more familiar [[avoirdupois|avoirdupois weight]] system. The term \"ounces\" of gold typically refers to troy ounces. There are some historical uses where, because of the age of the use, the intention is ambiguous.</ref> (370&nbsp;[[metric ton|t]]) of gold were removed in the first five years of the Gold Rush. This gold greatly increased the available money in the United States, which was on the [[gold standard]] at that time\u2014the more gold you had, the more you could buy.\n\nAs the easier gold was recovered, the mining became much more capital and labor-intensive as the hard rock quartz mining, hydraulic mining, and dredging mining evolved. By the mid-1880s, it is estimated that 11-million ounces (340&nbsp;t) of gold (worth approximately US$6.6&nbsp;billion at November 2006 prices) had been recovered via \"hydraulicking,\" a style of [[hydraulic mining]] that later spread around the world, despite its drastic environmental consequences. By the late 1890s, [[dredging]] technology had become economical,<ref name=RawlsDredge>Rawls, James J. and Orsi, Richard (eds.) (1999), p. 199.</ref> and it is estimated that more than 20&nbsp;million ounces (620&nbsp;t) were recovered by dredging (worth approximately US$12&nbsp;billion at November 2006 prices). Both during the Gold Rush and in the decades that followed, hard-rock mining wound up being the single-largest source of gold produced in the [[Gold Country]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3014/ |title=Mercury Contamination from Historical Gold Mining in California |accessdate=2008-02-26 |author1=Charles N.

Hothem |work=[[U.S. Geological Survey]]}}</ref>\n\nBy 1850, the [[U.S. Navy]] started making plans for a west coast navy base at [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard]]. The greatly increased population, along with the new wealth of gold, caused: roads, bridges, farms, mines, steamship lines, businesses, [[western saloon|saloons]], gambling houses, boarding houses, churches, schools, towns, mercury mines, and other components of a rich modern (1850) U.S. culture to be built. The sudden growth in population caused many more towns to be built throughout Northern, and later Southern, California and the few existing towns to be greatly expanded. The first cities started showing up as [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Sacramento|Sacramento]] exploded in population.\n\n====Effects on indigenous population====\nMost California Indians are thought to have been located near the coast, the same areas the Spanish Missions were established. Since California Indians had no agriculture before it was introduced by the [[Franciscan]] padres, they were strictly [[hunter-gatherer]] society tribes which could not support large populations\u2014large populations require agriculture. During the Spanish and Mexican California occupation period nearly all coastal tribes south of San Francisco were induced to join a mission. So many Mission Indians died from exposure to harsh conditions at the missions and diseases like measles, diphtheria, smallpox, syphilis, etc. that at times raids were undertaken to new villages in the interior to supplement the supply of Indian women at the missions. As reported by Krell, as  of December 31, 1832, the mission Franciscan ''padres'' from 1800 to 1830 had performed a combined total of 87,787 baptisms and 24,529 marriages, and recorded 63,789 deaths.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/> If Krell's numbers are to be believed (others have slightly different numbers) the Mission Indian population had declined from a peak of about 87,000 in about 1800 to about 14,000 in 1832 and continued to decline. The Missions were becoming ever more strained as the number of Indian converts drastically declined and the deaths greatly exceeded the births. The ratio of Indian births to deaths is believed to have been less than 0.5 Indian births per death.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/> After the missions were disbanded in 1832 the surviving Indians mostly went to work on the about 500 newly established [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] who appropriated the mission's \"property\" (about {{convert|1000000|acre|ha}} acres/mission). The Indians typically worked  at one of the four Spanish pueblos as servants or at the newly established ranchos for room and board or attempted to join other tribes in the interior. The new ranchos occupied nearly all their original tribal territories.\n\nThe new wave of immigration that was sparked by the gold rush would continue to have a disastrous impact on California's native population, which continued to precipitously decline mainly due to Eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617 |title=Destruction of the California Indians |publisher=[[California Secretary of State]] |accessdate=2012-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207115225/http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617 |archivedate=2011-12-07 }}</ref> Like when the [[Spanish missions in California]] were established the native inhabitants were often forcefully removed from their traditional tribal lands by incoming miners, ranchers, and farmers. There were a number of massacres, including the [[Yontoket massacre]], the [[Bloody Island massacre]] at Clear Lake, and the Old Shasta Massacre, in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed. Thousands more are thought to have died due to disease. Combined with a low birth rate for Indian women the Indian population precipitously declined.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1860, the state of California paid around 1.5 million dollars (some $250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/MilitiaandIndians.html|title=California Militia and Expeditions Against the Indians, 1850 - 1859|website=Militarymuseum.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> to hire \"militias\" whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations. These \"private military forays\" were involved in several of the above-mentioned massacres, and sometimes participated in the \"wanton killing\" of Native peoples. The first governor of California, [[Peter Burnett]], openly called for the extermination of the Indian tribes, and in reference to the violence against California's Native population, he said, \"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.\"<ref name=\"cabrillo.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_americanperiod.html|title=INDIANS of CALIFORNIA - American Period|website=Cabrillo.edu|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> As a result, the rise of modern California equalled great tragedy and hardship for the native inhabitants. Several scholars, including Benjamin Madley and [[Ed Castillo]], have described the actions of the California government as a [[California Genocide|genocide]].<ref name=\"cabrillo.edu\"/><ref name=\"cabrillo.edu\"/>\n\nIn subsequent decades after 1850, the native population of more than 100 tribes were gradually placed in a series of reservations and rancherias, which were often very small and isolated and lacked adequate natural resources or funding from the government to sustain the populations living on them in the [[hunter-gathering]] style they were used to living.\n\n====Maritime history of California====\n{{Main|Maritime history of California}}\nThe Maritime history of California includes Native American dugouts, tule canoes, and sewn canoes ([[Tomol]]s); early European explorers; Colonial Spanish and Mexican California maritime history; Russians and [[Aleut people|Aleut]] [[kayak]]s in the [[Maritime Fur Trade]].

Lincoln and London: Univ. of Nebraska Press, (1974).]</ref>\n\n====California in the American Civil War====\n{{Main|California in the American Civil War}}\n\nThe possibility of splitting off Southern California as a territory or a state was rejected by the national government, and the idea was dead by 1861 when patriotic fervor swept California after the attack on [[Fort Sumter]].\n\nCalifornia's involvement in the [[American Civil War]] included sending gold east, recruiting or funding a limited number of combat units, maintaining numerous fortifications and sending troops east, some of whom became famous. Following the split in the Democratic Party in 1860, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] supporters of Lincoln took control of the state in 1861, minimizing the influence of the large southern population. Their great success was in obtaining a Pacific railroad land grant and authorization to build the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] as the western half of the transcontinental railroad.\n\nCalifornia was settled primarily by [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States|Southern]] farmers, miners, and businessmen. Though the southerners and some Californios tended to favor the Confederacy, the state did not have slavery, and they were generally powerless during the war itself. They were prevented from organizing and their newspapers were closed down by denying them the use of the mail. Former Sen. [[William M. Gwin]], a Confederate sympathizer, was arrested and fled to Europe.\n\nNearly all of the men who volunteered as Union soldiers stayed in the West, within the [[Department of the Pacific]], to guard forts and other facilities, occupy secessionist regions, and fight Indians in the state and the western territories. Some 2,350 men in the [[California Column]] marched east across Arizona in 1862 to expel the Confederates from Arizona and New Mexico. The California Column then spent most of the remainder of the war fighting hostile Indians in the area.\n\n====Early California transportation====\nEven before Mexico gained control of [[Alta California]] in 1821, the onerous Spanish rules in effect from 1770 to 1821 against trading with foreigners began to break down as the declining Spanish fleet couldn't enforce their no trading policies. The Californios, with essentially no industries or manufacturing capabilities, were eager to trade for new commodities, glass, hinges, nails, finished goods, luxury goods and other merchandise. The Mexican government abolished the no trade with foreign ships policy and soon regular trading trips were being made. The main products of these [[Ranchos of California|California Ranchos]] were [[leather|cow hides]] (called California greenbacks), [[tallow]] (rendered fat for making candles and soap) and [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|California/Texas longhorn cattle]] horns<ref>{{cite web | title=California Longhorns Vs. Texas Longhorns of Yesteryear and Today - A Comparative Study | author=Michael Casey | url=http://www.fairlealonghorns.com/Default.aspx?ID=566&Title=CaliforniavsTexasLonghorns | publisher=Fairlea Longhorns | accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> that were traded for other finished goods and merchandise. This hide-and-tallow trade was mainly carried on by Boston-based ships that traveled for about 200 days in [[sailing ship]]s about {{convert|17000|mi|km}} to {{convert|18000|mi|km}} around [[Cape Horn]] to bring finished goods and merchandise to trade with the Californio Ranchos for their hides, tallow and horns. The cattle and horses that provided the hides, tallow and horns essentially grew wild. The Californios' hides, tallow and horns provided the necessary trade articles for a mutually beneficial trade. The first United States, English and Russian trading ships began showing up in California before 1816. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] written about 1832 provides a good first hand account of this trade.,<ref name=\"Dana, Richard 2010\">Dana, Richard; ''Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea'' Republished by CreateSpace (2010)  {{ISBN|978-1-4564-7282-5}}</ref><ref>Google eBook [https://archive.org/details/twoyearsbeforem01smitgoog ''Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea''] accessed 9 February 2012</ref>\n\nFrom 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year\u2014a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/> The port of entry for trading purposes was the Alta California Capital, [[Monterey, California]], where custom duties ([[tariff]]s) of about 100% were applied. These high duties gave rise to much bribery and smuggling, as avoiding the tariffs made more money for the ship owners and made the goods less costly to the customers. Essentially all the cost of the California government (what little there was) was paid for by these tariffs (custom duties). In this they were much like the United States in 1850, where about 89% of the revenue of its federal government came from import tariffs (also called Customs or [[ad valorem tax]]es), although at an average rate of about 20%.<ref name=\"usgovernmentrevenue.com\"/>\n\nShips after 1848 provided easy, cheap, links among the coastal towns within California and on routes leading there. Nearly all cargo to California came by [[sailing ship]] until the completion of the [[first Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. The sea route was more than {{convert|17000|mi|km}} route from the east coast or Europe around [[Cape Horn]] in [[South America]]. This route averaged about 200 days by \"standard\" [[sailing ship]] or about 120 days by [[Clipper]]. One of the main problems that occurred during the gold rush was the lack of a paying cargo for ships leaving California. Food, supplies and passengers were the main cargo coming to California; but there were only a limited return trade of returning passengers, mail and gold. Many of the sailing ships that arrived in [[San Francisco Bay]] were abandoned there or converted into warehouses or landfill.\n\nThe Panama and Nicaragua routes provided a shortcut for getting from the East Coast to California and a brisk maritime passenger trade developed, featuring fast [[paddle steamer]]s from cities on the east coast, [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Havana]] Cuba to the Caribbean mouth of the [[Chagres River]] in Panama and the mouth of [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] in Nicaragua. After a trip up the Chagres River by native dugouts the last {{convert|20|mi|km}} were completed to Panama City by mule back. The trip up the San Juan River in Nicaragua was usually done by small steam launch to [[Lake Nicaragua]], a boat trip on the lake and a final {{convert|25|mi|km}} trip by stage coach or mule back to [[San Juan del Sur]] or other city in the Pacific side of Nicaragua. After 1855 when the Panama Railroad was completed the Nicaragua route largely shut down.\n\nIn 1846 the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was settled with [[Great Britain]] and California was under U.S. control in 1847 and annexed and paid for in 1848. The United States was now a Pacific Ocean power. Starting in 1848 the [[U.S. Congress]], after the annexation of California but before the [[California Gold Rush]] was confirmed there, had subsidized the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] with $199,999 to set up regular [[packet ship]], mail, passenger and cargo routes in the Pacific Ocean. This was to be a regular scheduled route from [[Panama City]], Nicaragua and [[Mexico]] to and from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Oregon|Oregon]]. Panama City was the Pacific terminus of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] trail across Panama. The Atlantic Ocean mail contract from East Coast cities and [[New Orleans]] to and from the mouth of the [[Chagres River]] in [[Isthmus of Panama]] was won by the [[United States Mail Steamship Company]] whose first [[paddle wheel]] steamship, the SS Falcon (1848) was dispatched on 1 December 1848 to the Caribbean (Atlantic) terminus of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] trail\u2014the [[Chagres River]].\n\nIn 1849 [[William H. Aspinwall]], the man who had won the bid for the building and operating of the Pacific mail steamships, conceived a plan to construct a railway across the [[isthmus of Panama]]; he and his partners created a company registered in New York, the [[Panama Railroad Company]], raised US$1,000,000 from the sale of stock, and hired companies to conduct engineering and route studies. Their venture happened to be well-timed, as the discovery of gold in California in January 1848 created a rush of emigrants wanting to cross the Isthmus of Panama and go on to California or return home. [[Cholera]], [[yellow fever]], and [[malaria]] took a deadly toll on the Railroad workers, and despite the continual importation of large numbers of new workers, there were times when the work stalled for simple lack of alive and semi-fit workers. All railroad supplies and nearly all foodstuffs had to be imported from thousands of miles away, greatly adding to the cost of construction. Laborers came from the United States, the [[Caribbean]] Islands, and as far away as Ireland, India, China, and Australia.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924021538214/page/n34 <!-- pg=21 -->  Fessenden Nott Otis, '''Isthmus of Panama: History of the Panama railroad; and of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company''', Harper & Brothers, New York, 1867 pp. 21-36.]</ref> Upon completion in 1855 the road stretched {{convert|47|mi|km}} and had cost over $8,000,000 and about 5,000 lives.

Only a few were going all the way to California.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/PassLists/ca022849.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990424163308/http://www.maritimeheritage.org/PassLists/ca022849.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=1999-04-24 | title=The Maritime Heritage Project Passenger Lists}}</ref> As word of the gold strikes spread, the {{SS|California|1848|6}} picked up more passengers in [[Valparaiso]] [[Chile]] and [[Panama City]] [[Panama]] and showed up in San Francisco on 28 February 1849. She was loaded with about 400 gold seeking passengers; twice the number of passengers it had been designed for. In San Francisco all her passengers and crew except the captain and one man deserted the ship and it would take the Captain two more months to gather a much better paid return crew to return to Panama city an establish the route they had been contracted for. Many more paddle steamers were soon running from the east coast cities to the [[Chagres River]] in Panama and the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] in Nicaragua. By the mid 1850s there were over ten Pacific and ten Atlantic/Caribbean paddle wheel steamboats shuttling high valued freight like passengers, gold and mail between California and both the Pacific and Caribbean ports. The trip to the east coast could be executed after about 1850 in as short as 40 days if all ship connections could be met with a minimum of waiting.\n\nSteamboats plied the Bay Area and the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River]]s that flowed nearer the goldfields, moving passengers and supplies from San Francisco to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Marysville, California|Marysville]] and [[Stockton, California]]\u2014the three main cities supplying the gold fields. The city of Stockton, on the lower San Joaquin, quickly grew from a sleepy backwater to a thriving trading center, the stopping-off point for miners headed to the gold fields in the foothills of the Sierra. Rough ways such as the Millerton Road which later became the [[Stockton - Los Angeles Road]]<ref>Hoover and Kyle, p. 376</ref> quickly extended the length of the valley and were served by mule teams and covered wagons.<ref>{{cite web | last=Coate | first=Bill | title=Last blast from steamers on the San Joaquin | url=http://www.maderatribune.com/life/lifeview.asp?c=100216 | publisher=Madera Tribune | date=March 16, 2003 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024843/http://www.maderatribune.com/life/lifeview.asp?c=100216 | archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> [[Riverboat]] navigation quickly became an important transportation link on the San Joaquin River, and during the \"June Rise\",<ref>Rose, p. 54</ref> as boat operators called the San Joaquin's annual high water levels during snow melt, on a wet year large craft could make it as far upstream as Fresno.

Soon a system of wagon roads, bridges, ferries and toll roads were set up many of them maintained by tolls collected from the users. Large freight wagons pulled by up to 10 mules replaced pack trains, and toll roads built and kept passable by the tolls made it easier to get to the mining camps, enabling express companies to deliver firewood, lumber, food, equipment, clothes, mail, packages, etc. to the miners. Later when communities developed in Nevada some steamboats were even used to haul cargo up the [[Colorado River]] as high as where [[Lake Mead]] in Nevada is today.\n\n[[File:Butterfield-Overland.gif|thumb|500px|''The stage routes from a Butterfield Overland Mail Company map.'']]\n\nThe '''[[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line''' <ref>Also known as the '''Oxbow Route''', the '''Butterfield Overland Stage''', or the '''Butterfield Stage'''</ref> was a [[stagecoach]] service  operating from 1857 to 1861 of over {{convert|2800|mi|km}}.

News paper correspondents reported that they had a preview of \"hell\" when they took the trip.<ref name=\"Root, p. 42\"/>\n\nOnce cargo was moved off the ocean and rivers it nearly always transported by horse or ox drawn wagons\u2014still true till about 1920. When there was not a wagon trail the cargo was shifted to mule pack trains or carried on the backs of the miners. Lumber to build new homes, sluice boxes, etc. was a crying need and food to feed the miners was needed even more. However, California has a lot of native timber and even as early as 1850 there were saw mills set up to turn some of this timber into lumber. Food was initially imported from any and all west coast ports from Hawaii, Oregon or Mexico where it could be obtained. The lumber and food were transported by ships that had initially carried gold rush passengers and in many cases abandoned in the bay and could usually be bought cheap. The many goods the gold miners needed for a \"modest\" 1850s lifestyle were nearly always hauled by horse, mule or ox drawn wagons. Wheat and timber were early products from Oregon and the [[Columbia River]] area that could be economically imported. Soon it was found that some types of spring wheat could be planted in the fall in California and the mild winter with its rains would allow good crops to be harvested in the spring without irrigation. Later. much of this wheat was exported to ports around the world, California finally had a return cargo for its many incoming ships. California in the 1890s became the foremost wheat producer in the U.S. but could not really compete on the east coast with the burgeoning wheat lands being brought into production in the midwest were much closer to their markets. Other crops in California were usually found to be much more profitable and California joined the rest of the nation in importing most of its wheat from farms in the midwest.\n\nThe year 1848 saw the close of Mexican control over Alta California, this period also marked the beginning of the [[Ranchos of California|rancheros']] greatest prosperity. The Californio rancho society before 1848 had few resources except large herds of [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Longhorn cattle]] which grew almost wild in California. The Ranchos produced the largest [[cowhide]] (called California Greenbacks) and [[tallow]] business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and cutting off their fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s then common in California. The traders who traded for the hides, tallow and sometimes horns hauled them back to the east coast where the hides were used to make a large variety of leather products, most of the tallow was used for making candles and the horns were mostly used for making buttons. A trading trip typically took over two years. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' (originally published 1840) by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] gives a good  first-hand account of a two-year [[sailing ship]] [[sea]] trading voyage to California which he took in 1834\u20135. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|California longhorn]] horns. Horns were used to make a large number of items in this time period. (The eBook of ''Two Years Before the Mast'' is available at Gutenberg project.)<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4277?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana|website=Gutenberg.org|accessdate=7 November 2017|date=July 2003}}</ref> A large part of the Californio diet was beef, but since there was no easy way to preserve it most of the time another animal was killed when fresh meat was needed as when visitors showed up\u2014the hides and tallow could be salvaged and very little was lost. The market for beef dramatically changed with the onset of the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], as thousands of miners, businessmen and other fortune seekers flooded into northern California. These newcomers needed meat, and cattle prices soared from the $1.00 to $2.00 per hide to $30.00-$50.00 per cow. From about 1848 to about 1860 the rancheros enjoyed the \"golden\" days of Hispanic California. The largely illiterate ranchero owners lost nearly all their land to a few bad years for cattle in the 1860s and the many mortgages they had taken out to finance a \"prosperous\" life style and could no longer pay back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mchsmuseum.com/cattle.html|title=Monterey County Historical Society, Local History Pages--The California Cattle Boom, 1849-1862|website=Mchsmuseum.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> In the early years of the Gold Rush the demand for beef was so great that there are records of about 60,000 longhorns being herded from Texas to California.<ref>Hutchinson, W.

These combined stage and Pony Express stations along the Central Route across Utah and Nevada were joined by the [[first transcontinental telegraph]] stations (completed 24 October 1861). The Pony express terminated soon after the telegraph was established. This combination wagon-stagecoach-pony express-telegraph line route is labeled the ''Pony Express National Historic Trail'' on the National Trail Map.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pony Express Trail map |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/trails/natltrails.pdf|website=Fs.fed.us|accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref> From Salt Lake City, the telegraph line followed much of the Mormon-California-Oregon trail(s) to Omaha, Nebraska. After the [[first transcontinental railroad]] was completed in 1869, the telegraph lines along the railroad tracks became the main line, since the required relay stations, lines and telegraph operators were much easier to supply and maintain along the railroad. The telegraph lines that diverged from the railroad lines or significant population centers were largely abandoned.\n\nAfter the 1870s, stagecoaches provided the primary form of local passenger and mail transportation between inland towns that were not connected to a railroad, with sailing ships and [[paddle wheel]] steamships connecting port cities. Freight wagons still hauled nearly all cargo. Even when railroads arrived, stages were essential to link more remote areas to the railheads. Top of the line in quality, with crowded discomfort, was the nine-passenger [[Concord stagecoach]], but the cheaper, rougher \"mud wagons\" were also in general use. The [[Wells Fargo]] company contracted with independent lines to deliver its express packages and transport gold bullion and coins. Stagecoach travel was usually uncomfortable as passengers were often crowded together in limited space, dust pouring through open windows from rough unpaved roads, rough rides, un-bathed fellow passengers and poorly sprung steel tired [[stagecoach]]es. Some drivers were famous for their skill in driving six horses down winding roads at top speed, only rarely overturning. Rate competition from competing stage lines reduced fares to as little a two cents per mile on some routes\u2014a $1.00/day was then a common wage. Bandits found robbing coaches a profitable if risky venture as they may be shot or hanged if caught. U.S. government mail subsidies provided essential base income for many stage lines, but running a stage line was often a financially unstable business enterprise.\n\n====Railroads====\n[[File:East and West Shaking hands at the laying of last rail Union Pacific Railroad - Restoration.jpg|thumb|Workers drive in the [[golden spike]] on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], 1869]]\n{{Main|History of rail transportation in California}}\n\nCalifornia's first railroad was built from Sacramento to Folsom, California starting in February 1855. This {{convert|22|mile|km}} line was meant to take advantage of the prosperous gold diggings in [[Placerville, California]] but were completed at about the same time (February 1856) as the mining near there came to an end. The [[first Transcontinental Railroad]] from [[Sacramento, California]] to [[Omaha, Nebraska]] was completed on 9 May 1869. The [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the Pacific end of the railroad, largely took over nearly all freight across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]] mountains in Northern California. By 1870 there were railroad connections to [[Oakland, California]] and via a train [[ferry]] to [[San Francisco, California]] from Sacramento\u2014effectively connecting all the major cities in California then to the east coast.\n\n[[File:Train at Arcade Station, 1891 (00031881).jpg|thumb|A Southern Pacific Train at [[Arcade Depot]], Los Angeles, 1891]]\n\nSouthern California's first railroad, the [[Los Angeles & San Pedro Railroad]], was inaugurated in October, 1869 by [[John G.

Each of these railroads controlled one (and Southern Pacific controlled two) of the transcontinental railroads which linked California with states farther East. The railroads moved freight and passengers in large quantities and allowed the state's economy and population to expand rapidly during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBy the 1890s the construction of electric railroads had begun in California and by the early 20th century several systems existed to serve California's largest cities. The state's electric railroad systems included the [[San Diego Electric Railway]], Los Angeles' [[Pacific Electric]] system, the [[Los Angeles Pacific Railroad]], [[East Bay Electric Lines]] and the [[Key System|San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose Railway]] and [[Interurban]] rail systems such as the [[Sacramento Northern Railway]] were also constructed. By the 1920s, Los Angeles' [[Pacific Electric]] system was the largest electric railroad in the world.\n\n[[File:Amtrak Capitol Corridor.jpg|thumb|An Amtrak Capitol Corridor train passing through [[Santa Clara Station (California)|Santa Clara Station]] in 2005.]]\n\nThe expansion of American railroads peaked in the 1910s and during [[the Great Depression]] many railroads suffered financial difficulties which led to some railroad bankruptcies. [[World War II]] caused a surge in the use of California's railroads but with the government funded construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the 1950s and the expansion of the [[Airline#U.S. airline industry|U.S. airline industry]] passenger rail service declined dramatically.\n\nThe 1970s saw the end of private passenger railroads in California, the creation of a national passenger railroad ([[Amtrak]]) and the [[Bay Area]]'s opening of the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] rail-system. In the 1980s and 1990s commuter railroads where established in the Bay Area ([[Caltrain]] and [[Altamont Corridor Express]]), Los Angeles ([[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]]) and San Diego ([[Coaster (commuter rail)|Coaster]]) and [[light rail]] networks were built or expanded in most urban areas.\n\nThe early 2000s saw the expansion in usage of passenger rail service and in 2008 [[California Proposition 1A (2008)|voters approved]] plans for the construction of a [[California High-Speed Rail|high-speed rail network]].\n\n==History of California, 1900 to present==\n{{Main|History of California 1900 to present}}\nAfter 1900, California continued to grow rapidly and soon became an agricultural and industrial power. The economy was widely based on specialty agriculture, oil, tourism, shipping, film, and after 1940 advanced technology such as aerospace and electronics industries \u2013 along with a significant military presence. The films and stars of [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] helped make the state the \"center\" of worldwide attention. California became an American cultural phenomenon; the idea of the \"California Dream\" as a portion of the larger [[American Dream]] of finding a better life drew 35 million new residents from the start to the end of the 20th century (1900\u20132010).<ref>{{cite book| author=Walter Nugent| title=Into the West: The Story of Its People| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AvI-biS6EsC&pg=PA5| year=2001| publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.| page=5| isbn=9780307426420}}</ref> [[Silicon Valley]] became the world's center for computer innovation.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|History|North America|United States|California}}\n* [[Outline of California history]]\n* [[Territorial evolution of California]]\n* [[History of California before 1900]]\n* [[History of California 1900 to present]]\n* {{C|History museums in California}}\n* [[California Dream]]\n\n; History of locations in California\n* [[History of Chico, California]]\n* [[History of Los Angeles, California]]\n* [[History of Piedmont, California]]\n* [[History of Riverside, California]]\n* [[History of Sacramento, California]]\n* [[History of San Bernardino, California]]\n* [[History of San Diego, California]]\n* [[History of San Francisco, California]]\n* [[History of San Jose, California]]\n* [[History of Santa Ana, California]]\n* [[History of Santa Barbara, California]]\n* [[History of Santa Monica, California]]\n* [[History of the San Fernando Valley to 1915]]\n* [[Timeline of the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Aron, Stephen. \"Convergence, California and the Newest Western History\", ''California History'' Volume: 86#4 September 2009. pp 4+ historiography.\n* Bakken, Gordon Morris.

It was one of the most culturally and linguistically diverse areas in [[Pre-Columbian era#North America|pre-Columbian North America]]. After contact with [[:Category:Spanish explorers of the Pacific|Spanish explorers]], most of the Native Americans died out from European diseases.\n\nAfter the [[Portol\u00e1 expedition]] of 1769\u201370, Spanish missionaries began setting up 21 [[Spanish missions in California|California Missions]] on or near the coast of [[Alta California|Alta (Upper) California]], beginning with the [[Mission San Diego de Alcal\u00e1|Mission San Diego de Alcala]] near the location of the modern day city of San Diego, California. During the same period, Spanish military forces built several forts (''[[presidio]]s'') and three small towns (''pueblos''). Two of the pueblos would eventually grow into the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. After Mexican Independence was won in 1821, California fell under the jurisdiction of the [[First Mexican Empire]]. Fearing the influence of the Roman Catholic church over their newly independent nation, the Mexican government [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|closed all of the missions]] and nationalized the church's property. They left behind a small \"[[Californio]]\" (white Hispanic) population of several thousand families, with a few small military garrisons. After the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] of 1846\u201348, Mexico was forced to relinquish any claim to California to the United States. The unexpected discovery of gold at [[Sutter's Mill]] in 1848 produced a spectacular [[California Gold Rush|gold rush in Northern California]], attracting hundreds of thousand of ambitious young men from around the world. Only a few struck it rich, and many returned home disappointed. Most appreciated the other economic opportunities in California, especially in agriculture, and brought their families to join them. California became the 31st US state in 1850 and played a small role in the American Civil War. Chinese immigrants increasingly came under attack from [[Nativism (politics)#United States|nativists]]; they were forced out of industry and agriculture and into [[Chinatown]]s in the larger cities. As gold petered out, California increasingly became a highly productive agricultural society. The coming of the railroads in 1869 linked its rich economy with the rest of the nation, and attracted a steady stream of migrants. In the late 19th century, Southern California, especially Los Angeles, started to grow rapidly.\n\n==History of California through 1899==\n{{main|History of California through 1899}}\n\n===Pre-contact period===\n{{Main|Indigenous peoples of California}}\n[[File:Tikhanov - Balthazar Inhabitant of Northern California (1818).png|200px|thumb|''Balthazar, [[indigenous peoples of California|Inhabitant of Northern California]]'', painting by [[Mikhail Tikhanov]].]]\nDifferent tribes of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] lived in the area that is now California for an estimated 13,000 to 15,000 years.

''A History of California: The Spanish Period'', Macmillan Company 1939, pp. 57\u201369</ref> Mapmakers started using the name \"California\" to label the unexplored territory on the North American west coast.\n\nEuropean explorers flying the flags of Spain and of England explored the Pacific Coast of California beginning in the mid-16th century. [[Francisco de Ulloa]] explored the west coast of present-day Mexico including the [[Gulf of California]], proving that [[Baja California peninsula|Baja California]] was a peninsula,<ref>Gutierrez, Ramon A, and Richard J. Orsi, ''Contested Eden: California before the Gold Rush'', University of California Press,1998, {{ISBN|0-520-21273-8}}, p. 81-82</ref> but in spite of his discoveries the myth persisted in European circles that California was an [[Island of California|island]].\n\nRumors of fabulously wealthy cities located somewhere along the California coast, as well as a possible [[Northwest Passage]] that would provide a much shorter route to the [[Indies]], provided an incentive to explore further.\n\n====First European contact (1542)====\nThe first European to explore the California coast was [[Juan Rodr\u00edguez Cabrillo]] ({{lang-pt|Jo\u00e3o Rodrigues Cabrilho}}), working for Spain. He died in southern California in 1543. Cabrillo and his men found that there was essentially nothing for the Spanish to easily exploit in California, and located at the extreme limits of exploration and trade from Spain it would be left essentially unexplored and unsettled for the next 234 years.\n\nThe Cabrillo expedition depicted the Indigenous populations as living at a subsistence level, typically located in small [[rancheria]]s of extended family groups of [[Dunbar's number|100 to 150 people]].<ref name=\"fourdir\">{{cite web|url=http://www.fourdir.com/california_cultures.htm|publisher=Four Directions Institute|title=California Indian Cultures|accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref> They had no apparent agriculture as understood by Europeans, no domesticated animals except dogs, no pottery; their tools were made out of wood, leather, woven baskets and netting, stone, and antler. Some shelters were made of branches and mud; some dwellings were built by digging into the ground two to three feet and then building a brush shelter on top covered with animal skins, [[Schoenoplectus acutus|tules]] and/or mud.<ref name=\"fourdir\"/> The Cabrillo expedition did not see the far north of California, where on the coast and somewhat inland traditional architecture consists of rectangular redwood or cedar plank semisubterranean houses.\n\nTraditional clothing was minimal in the summer, with tanned deerhide and other animal leathers and furs and coarse woven articles of grass clothing used in winter. Feathers were sewn into prayer pieces worn for ceremonies. Some tribes around [[Santa Barbara, California]] and the [[Channel Islands (California)|Channel Islands]] were using large plank canoes to fish and trade, while tribes in the California delta and San Francisco Bay Area were using tule canoes and some tribes on the Northwest coast carved redwood [[Dugout (boat)|dugout]] canoes.<ref name=\"fourdir\"/>\n\nThe staple foods then used by other Indigenous American tribes, corn and/or potatoes, would not grow without irrigation in the typically short three- to five-month wet season and nine- to seven-month dry seasons of California (see [[Mediterranean climate]]). Despite this, the natural abundance of California, and the environmental management techniques developed by California tribes over millennia, allowed for the highest population density in the Americas north of Mexico.<ref>Lightfoot, Kent and Otis Parrish (2009).

This tradition of landscape management through fire ecology maintained acorn groves and other food sources, which along with knowledge of migratory herds such as elk and anadromous runs of salmon in the rivers, supported villages, small tribes, and extended family groups.\n\nA dietary staple for most Indigenous populations in interior California was [[acorn]]s, which were dried, shelled, ground to flour, soaked in water to leach out their [[tannin]], and cooked. The grinding holes worn into large rocks over centuries of use are still visible in many rocks today.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?Content1=1416&Content2=1434&Content3=1326 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429222224/http://capitolmuseum.ca.gov/VirtualTour.aspx?Content1=1416&Content2=1434&Content3=1326 | url-status=dead | archive-date=2009-04-29 | title=Virtual Tours}}</ref> The ground and leached acorn flour was usually cooked into a nutritious mush, eaten daily with other traditional foods. Acorn preparation was a very labor-intensive process nearly always done by women. There are estimates that some Indigenous populations might have eaten as much as one ton of acorns in one year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/pacific/education/curriculum/4th-grade/acorn.html|title=Acorn consumption|website=Archives.gov|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222210032/http://www.archives.gov/pacific/education/curriculum/4th-grade/acorn.html|archive-date=2014-02-22|url-status=dead}}</ref> Families tended productive oak and tanoak groves for generations.

Local trade between Indigenous populations enabled them to acquire seasonings such as salt, or foodstuffs and other goods that might be rare in certain locales, such as flint or obsidian for making spear and arrow points. Native cultures in California are much different from other cultures of Indigenous populations in North America, and some have survived to the present day.\n\nCalifornia indigenous language diversity numbered 80 to 90 languages and dialects, some surviving to the present although endangered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/california-languages.php|accessdate=25 February 2018|title=Survey of California and Other Indian Languages|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160523020014/http://linguistics.berkeley.edu/~survey/languages/california-languages.php|archive-date=23 May 2016|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The high and rugged [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains located behind the [[Great Basin Desert]] east of California, extensive forests and mountains in the north, the rugged and harsh [[Sonoran Desert]] and [[Mojave Desert]] in the south and the Pacific Ocean on the west effectively isolated California from easy trade or tribal interactions with Indigenous populations on the rest of the continent, and delayed the tragedies and damages of colonial-settler arrival until the Spanish missions, the Gold Rush, and the Euro-American invasion of indigenous Californians' territories.\n\n====Spanish trading route (1565)====\nIn 1565 the Spanish developed a trading route where they took gold and silver from the Americas and traded it for goods and spices from China and other Asian areas. The Spanish set up their main base in the [[Philippines]]. The trade with Mexico involved using an annual passage of [[Manila galleon]](s). The Eastbound galleons first went north to about 40 degrees [[latitude]] and then turning East they could use the westerly [[trade wind]]s and currents. These galleons, after crossing most of the Pacific Ocean, would arrive off the California coast from 60 to over 120 days later somewhere near [[Cape Mendocino]] (about {{convert|300|mi|km}} north of San Francisco) at about 40 degrees N. latitude. They then could turn south down the California coast utilizing the available winds and the south flowing (about 1&nbsp;mi/hr (1.6&nbsp;km/h)) [[California Current]]. After sailing about {{convert|1500|mi|km|}} south on they eventually reached their home port in Mexico. [[San Francisco Bay]] escaped discovery for two centuries until it was finally discovered by land exploration in 1769.\n\n====Francis Drake's claim (1579)====\n[[File:Sir Francis Drake Quadracentennial Plaque at Drake's Beach, Point Reyes National Seashore, Marin County, California.JPG|thumb|Francis Drake \"Nova Albion\" Quadracentennial Plaque at Drake's Beach]]\nThe English explorer and [[privateer]] [[Francis Drake]] sailed south along the coast of northern California in 1579 after capturing two Spanish treasure ships in the Pacific. It is believed Drake put ashore somewhere north of San Francisco, where the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' underwent extensive repairs and accumulated needed supplies for a trip across the Pacific. Leaving California, he completed the second recorded [[circumnavigation]] of the world (after [[Ferdinand Magellan]]) in 1580.\n\nThe exact location of Drake's port is still undetermined, but a prominent bay on the California coast, [[Drakes Bay]], bears his name. He claimed all the land south of 42 degrees latitude, north of the imprecise Spanish claims and eastward from coast to coast for England, calling it [[Nova Albion]]. The term \"Nova Albion\" was often used on European maps to designate territory north of the Spanish claims. Spanish maps, explorations etc., of this and later eras were generally not published, being regarded as state secrets. As was typical in this era, there were conflicting claims to the same territory, and the indigenous peoples who lived there were never consulted.\n\nIn 1602, sixty years after Cabrillo, the Spaniard [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]] explored California's coastline from San Diego as far north as [[Monterey Bay]]. He named [[San Diego Bay]].  He also put ashore in [[Monterey, California]] and made glowing reports of the Monterey bay area as a possible anchorage for ships with land suitable for growing crops. He also provided rudimentary charts of the coastal waters, which were used for nearly 200 years.\n\n===Spanish colonial period (1769\u20131821)===\n[[File:Misi\u00f3n Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3]], [[Loreto, Baja California Sur]], was founded in 1697.]]\n\n{{anchor|Spanishsettlement}}The Spanish divided California into two parts, [[Baja California]] and [[Alta California]], as provinces of [[New Spain]] (Mexico). Baja or lower California consisted of the [[Baja Peninsula]] and terminated roughly at [[San Diego, California]] where Alta California started. The eastern and northern boundaries of Alta California were very indefinite, as the Spanish, despite a lack of physical presence and settlements, claimed essentially everything in what is now the western United States.\n\nThe first permanent [[Spanish missions in Baja California|mission]] in Baja California, [[Misi\u00f3n de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Loreto Conch\u00f3]], was founded  on October 15, 1697, by [[Jesuit]] priest [[Juan Maria Salvatierra]] (1648\u20131717) accompanied by one small boat's crew and six soldiers. After the establishment of Missions in Alta California after 1769, the Spanish treated Baja California and Alta California as a single administrative unit, part of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]], with [[Monterey, California]], as its capital.\n\nNearly all the missions in Baja California were established by members of the [[Jesuit]] order supported by a few soldiers. After a power dispute between [[Charles III of Spain]] and the Jesuits, the Jesuit colleges were closed and the [[Suppression of the Society of Jesus|Jesuits were expelled]] from Mexico and South America in 1767 and deported back to Spain. After the forcible expulsion of the Jesuit order, most of the missions were taken over by [[Franciscan]] and later [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars. Both of these groups were under much more direct control of the [[Spanish monarchy]]. This reorganization left many missions abandoned in Sonora Mexico and Baja California.\n\n[[File:Map of California as an island R.W. Seale 1745.jpg|thumb|This 1745 map by British cartographer R.W. Seale misrepresented California as an island.]]\n\nAfter the conclusion of the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain and France and their allies (called the [[French and Indian War]] in the British colonies on the East Coast)  (1754\u20131763), France was driven out of North America. Spain and Britain were the only colonial powers left. Britain, as yet, had no Pacific colonies in North America. The Bourbon King [[Charles III of Spain]] established [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] and other outposts in [[Alta California]] out of fear that the territory would be claimed by the British, who not only had 13 colonies on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]], but also several islands in the Caribbean, and had recently taken over [[Canada under British rule (1763\u20131867)|Canada]] from the French.\n\nOne of Spain's gains from the Seven Years' War was the French [[Louisiana Territory]] which was secretly given to Spain. Another potential colonial power already established in the Pacific was Russia, whose [[Maritime Fur Trade]] of mostly sea otter and fur seals was pressing down from Alaska to the [[Pacific Northwest]]'s lower reaches. These furs could be traded in China for large profits.\n\nThe Spanish settlement of Alta California was the last colonization project to expand Spain's vastly over-extended empire in North America, and they tried to do it with minimal cost and support. Approximately half the cost of settling Alta California was borne by donations and half by funds from the Spanish crown. Massive Indian revolts in [[New Mexico]]'s [[Pueblo Revolt]] among the [[Pueblo Indians]] of the [[Rio Grande]] valley in the 1680s as well as [[Pima Indian Revolt]] in 1751 and the ongoing [[Seri people|Seri]] conflicts in [[Sonora Mexico]] provided the [[Franciscan]] friars with arguments to establish missions with fewer colonial settlers. In particular, the sexual exploitation of Native American women by Spanish soldiers sparked violent reprisals from the Native community and the spread of venereal disease.<ref>Starr, Kevin. ''California: A History''. New York: Modern Library (2005), Chapter 2.</ref>\n\nThe remoteness and isolation of California, the lack of large organized tribes, the lack of agricultural traditions, the absence of any domesticated animals larger than a dog, and a food supply consisting primarily of acorns (unpalatable to most Europeans) meant the missions in California would be very difficult to establish and sustain and made the area unattractive to most potential colonists. A few soldiers and friars financed by the Church and State would form the backbone of the proposed settlement of California.\n\n====Portol\u00e1 expedition (1769\u20131770)====\nIn 1769, the Spanish Visitor General, [[Jos\u00e9 de G\u00e1lvez]], planned a [[Portol\u00e0 expedition|five part expedition]], consisting of three units by sea and two by land, to start settling Alta California. [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]] volunteered to command the expedition. The Catholic Church was represented by [[Franciscan]] friar [[Jun\u00edpero Serra]] and his fellow friars. All five detachments of soldiers, friars and future colonists were to meet on the shores of San Diego Bay. The first ship, the ''San Carlos'', sailed from [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz]] on January 10, 1769, and the ''San Antonio'' sailed on February 15. The ''San Antonio'' arrived in San Diego Bay on April 11 and the ''San Carlos'' on April 29. The third vessel, the ''San Jos\u00e9'', left [[New Spain]] later that spring but was lost at sea with no survivors.\n\n[[File:Coat of Arms of the Spanish Californias.svg|thumb|155px|Spanish colonial coat of arms for [[the Californias]].]]\n\nThe first land party, led by [[Fernando Rivera y Moncada]], left from the Franciscan [[Misi\u00f3n San Fernando Rey de Espa\u00f1a de Velicat\u00e1|Mission San Fernando Velicata]] on March 24, 1769.

[[Fernando Rivera y Moncada|Fernando de Rivera]] was appointed to command the lead party that would scout out a land route and blaze a trail to San Diego.<ref name=\"Rivera's explorations\"/> Food was short, and the Indians accompanying them  were expected to forage for most of what they needed. Many Indian neophytes died along the way; even more deserted. The two groups traveling from Lower California on foot had to cross about {{convert|300|mi|km}} of the very dry and rugged [[Baja Peninsula]].\n\nThe part of the expedition that took place over land took about 40\u201351 days to get to San Diego. The contingent coming by sea encountered the south flowing [[California Current]] and strong head winds, and were still straggling in three months after they set sail. After their arduous journeys, most of the men aboard the ships were ill, chiefly from [[scurvy]], and many had died. Out of a total of about 219 men who had left Baja California, little more than 100 survived. The survivors established the [[San Diego Presidio|Presidio of San Diego]] on May 14, 1769. [[Mission San Diego de Alcala]] was established on July 16, 1769. As the first of the presidios and Spanish missions in California, they provided the base of operations for the Spanish colonization of Alta California (present-day California).\n\nOn July 14, 1769, an expedition was dispatched from San Diego to find the port of Monterey. Not recognizing the [[Monterey Bay]] from the description written by [[Sebasti\u00e1n Vizca\u00edno]]  almost 200 years prior, the expedition traveled beyond it to what is now the [[San Francisco, California]] area. The exploration party, led by Don [[Gaspar de Portol\u00e0]], arrived on November 2, 1769, at [[San Francisco Bay]].,<ref name=\"Portola\">{{cite web|title=Visitors: San Francisco Historical Information |url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/visitor_index.asp?id=8091 |date=n.d. |accessdate=2008-06-10 |publisher=City and County of San Francisco |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331220353/http://www.sfgov.org/site/visitor_index.asp?id=8091 |archivedate=2008-03-31 }}</ref> One of the greatest ports on the west coast of America had finally been discovered by land. The expedition returned to San Diego on January 24, 1770.

They subsisted by eating some of their cattle, wild geese, fish, and other food exchanged with the Indians for clothing, but the ravages of scurvy continued because there was then no understanding of the cause or cure of scurvy (a deficiency of vitamin C in fresh food). A small quantity of corn they had planted grew well, only to be eaten by birds. Portol\u00e1 sent Captain Rivera and a small detachment of about 40 men south to the Baja California missions in February to obtain more cattle and a pack-train of supplies.\n\nFewer mouths to feed temporarily eased the drain on San Diego's scant provisions, but within weeks, acute hunger and increased sickness (scurvy) again threatened to force abandonment of the San Diego \"Mission\". Portol\u00e1 finally decided that if no relief ship arrived by March 19, 1770 they would leave to return to the \"[[New Spain]]\" missions on the [[Baja California peninsula|Baja Peninsula]] the next morning ''\"because there were not enough provisions to wait longer and the men had not come to perish from hunger.\"'' At three o'clock in the afternoon on March 19, 1770, as if by a miracle, the sails of the [[sailing ship]]  ''San Antonio'', loaded with relief supplies, were discernible on the horizon. The Spanish settlement of Alta California would continue.\n\n[[File:Juba map.jpg|thumb|Map of the route, Juan Bautista de Anza travelled in 1775-76 from Mexico to today's San Francisco via the Gila River corridor and the Yuma Crossing of the Colorado River.]] [[File:Mojave-sonoran deserts.png|thumb|Mojave and Sonoran deserts block easy land travel to California.

They went across the Sonoran desert to California from Mexico by swinging south of the [[Gila River]] to avoid [[Apache]] attacks until they hit the [[Colorado River]] at the [[Yuma Crossing]]\u2014about the only way across the Colorado River. The friendly [[Quechan]] (Yuma) Indians (2-3,000) he encountered there were growing most of their food, using irrigation systems, and had already imported pottery, horses, wheat and a few other crops from [[New Mexico]].<ref name=\"Guerro, Vladimir 2006\">Guerro, Vladimir; ''The Anza Trail: The Settling of California''; Heyday Books; (2006); {{ISBN|978-1-59714-026-3}}</ref>\n\nAfter crossing the Colorado to avoid the impassable [[Algodones Dunes]] west of [[Yuma, Arizona]], they followed the river about {{convert|50|mi|km}} south (to about the Arizona's southwest corner on the Colorado River)  before turning northwest to about today's [[Mexicali, Mexico]] and then turning north through today's [[Imperial Valley]] and then northwest again before reaching [[Mission San Gabriel Arc\u00e1ngel]] near the future city of [[Los Angeles, California]]. It took Anza about 74 days to do this initial reconnaissance trip to establish a land route into California. On his return trip he went down the [[Gila River]] until hitting the [[Santa Cruz River (Arizona)]] and continuing on to Tubac. The return trip only took 23 days, and he encountered several peaceful and  populous agricultural tribes with irrigation systems located along the Gila River.<ref name=\"Guerro, Vladimir 2006\"/>\n\nIn Anza's second trip (1775\u20131776) he returned  to California with 240 friars, soldiers and colonists with their families. They took 695 horses and mules, 385 [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|Texas Longhorn]] bulls and cows with them. The approximately 200 surviving cattle and an unknown number of horses (many of each were lost or eaten along the way) started the cattle and horse raising industry in California. In California the cattle and horses had few enemies and plentiful grass in all but drought years. They essentially grew and multiplied as feral animals, doubling roughly every two years. The party started from Tubac, Arizona, on October 22, 1775 and arrived at [[San Francisco Bay]] on March 28, 1776. There they established the [[Presidio of San Francisco]], followed by a [[mission (station)|mission]], [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (Mission Dolores) --the future city of [[San Francisco]].\n\nIn 1780, the Spanish established two combination missions and pueblos at the Yuma Crossing: [[Mission San Pedro y San Pablo de Bicu\u00f1er]] and [[Mission Puerto de Pur\u00edsima Concepci\u00f3n]]. Both these pueblos and missions were on the California side of the Colorado River but were administered by the Arizona authorities. On July 17\u201318, 1781 the Yuma ([[Quechan]]) Indians, in a dispute with the Spanish, destroyed both missions and pueblos\u2014killing 103 soldiers, colonists, and Friars and capturing about 80 prisoners, mostly women and children. In four well-supported punitive expeditions in 1782 and 1783 against the Quechans, the Spanish managed to gather their dead and ransom nearly all the prisoners, but failed to re-open the Anza Trail. The [[Yuma Crossing]] was closed for Spanish traffic and it would stay closed until about 1846. California was nearly isolated again from land based travel. About the only way into California from Mexico would now be a 40- to 60-day voyage by sea. The average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824 meant that additional colonists coming to Alta California were few and far between.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hb75yap6.htm|title=San Francisco History - Seventy-five Years in San Francisco, Appendix N.

The missions were nearly all located within {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the coast and almost no exploration or settlements were made in the [[Central Valley (California)]] or the [[Sierra Nevada (California)]]. The only expeditions anywhere close to the Central Valley and Sierras were the rare forays by soldiers undertaken to recover runaway Indians who had escaped from the Missions. The \"settled\" territory of about 15,000 square miles (40,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) was about 10% of California's eventual 156,000 square miles (400,000&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>) territory.\n\nIn 1786, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois de Galaup, comte de La P\u00e9rouse]] led a group of scientists and artists who compiled an account of the Californian mission system, the land, and the people. Traders, whalers, and scientific missions followed in the next decades.\n\n====California Mission network====\nThe [[California Missions]], after they were all established, were located about one day's horseback ride apart for easier communication and linked by the [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real trail]]. These Missions were typically manned by two to three friars and three to ten soldiers. Virtually all the physical work was done by  indigenous people convinced to or coerced into joining the missions. The padres provided instructions for making adobe bricks, building mission buildings, planting fields, digging irrigation ditches, growing new grains and vegetables, herding cattle and horses, singing, speaking Spanish, and understanding the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith\u2014all that was thought to be necessary to bring the Indians to be able to support themselves and their new church.\n\nThe soldiers supervised the construction of the Presidios (forts) and were responsible for keeping order and preventing and/or capturing runaway Indians that tried to leave the missions. Nearly all of the Indians adjoining the missions were induced to join the various missions built in California. Once the Indians had joined the mission, if they tried to leave, soldiers were sent out to retrieve them. In the 1830s, [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] observed that Indians were regarded and treated as slaves by the Spanish-speaking [[Californio]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last=Dana |first=Richard Henry |authorlink=Richard Henry Dana, Jr. |title=Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea |publisher=Harper & Brothers |year=1842 |location=New York |pages=93, 97, 209\u2013210}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Mission San Luis Rey de Francia courtyard.jpg|thumb|250px|The courtyard of Mission San Luis Rey de Francia, with California's oldest pepper tree (''[[Peruvian pepper|Schinus molle]]''), planted in 1830, visible through the arch.<ref>Young, p. 18</ref>]]\n\nThe missions eventually claimed about 1/6 of the available land in California or roughly {{convert|1000000|acre|km2|0}} of land per mission. The rest of the land was considered the property of the [[Spanish monarchy]]. To encourage settlement of the territory, large land grants were given to retired soldiers and colonists. Most grants were virtually free and typically went to friends and relatives in the California government. A few foreign colonists were accepted if they accepted Spanish citizenship and joined the Catholic Faith. The [[Mexican Inquisition]] was still in nearly full force and forbade Protestants living in Mexican controlled territory. In the Spanish colonial period many of these grants were later turned into [[Ranchos of California|Ranchos]].\n\nSpain made about 30 of these large grants, nearly all several square leagues (1 Spanish league = {{convert|2.6|mi|km}}) each in size. The total land granted to settlers in the Spanish colonial era was about {{convert|800000|acre|km2|0}} or about {{convert|35000|acre|km2|0}} each. The few owners of these large ranchos patterned themselves after the landed gentry in Spain and were devoted to keeping themselves living in a grand style. The rest of the population they expected to support them. Their mostly unpaid workers were nearly all Spanish trained Indians or [[peons]] that had learned how to ride horses and raise some crops. The majority of the ranch hands were paid with room and board, rough clothing, rough housing and no salary.\n\nThe main products of these ranchos were cattle, horses and sheep, most of which lived virtually wild. The cattle were mostly killed for fresh meat, as well as hides and tallow (fat) which could be traded or sold for money or goods. As the [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|cattle]] herds increased there came a time when nearly everything that could be made of leather was\u2014doors, window coverings, stools, [[chaps]], leggings, vests lariats ([[riata]])s, [[saddle]]s, boots  etc. Since there was no refrigeration then, often a cow was killed for the day's fresh meat and the hide and tallow salvaged for sale later. After taking the cattle's hide and tallow their carcasses were left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s which roamed wild in California at that time, or to feed the packs of dogs that typically lived at each rancho.\n\nA series of four ''presidios'', or \"royal forts\", each manned by 10 to 100 men, were built by Spain in Alta California. California installations were established in [[San Diego]] ([[Presidio of San Diego|El Presidio Real de San Diego]]) founded in 1769, in San Francisco ([[Presidio of San Francisco|El Presidio Real de San Francisco]]) founded in 1776, and in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] ([[Presidio of Santa Barbara|El Presidio Real de Santa B\u00e1rbara]]) founded in 1782. After the Spanish colonial era the [[Presidio of Sonoma]] in [[Sonoma, California]] was founded in 1834.<ref>(For the [[Juan Vicente de G\u00fcemes Padilla Horcasitas y Aguayo, 2nd Count of Revillagigedo|Revillagigedo]] Census of 1790 listing the inhabitants of Monterey and the other presidios and pueblos, see [http://sfgenealogy.com/spanish/cen1790.htm The Census of 1790, California], California Spanish Genealogy.

The pueblos of [[History of Los Angeles|Los Angeles]], [[History of San Diego|San Diego]], [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]], [[History of Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]], [[Villa de Branciforte]] (later abandoned before later becoming [[Santa Cruz, California]]) and the pueblo of [[History of San Jose, California|San Jose, California]] were all established to support the [[Spanish Missions of California|Missions]] and presidios in California. These were the only towns (pueblos) in California.\n\n===Mexican period (1821 to 1846)===\n[[File:Mexico 1824 (equirectangular projection).png|thumb|230px|[[First Mexican Republic|Mexico]] in 1824. [[Alta California]] is the northwestern-most country.]]\n\nIn 1821, Mexico gained its independence from Spain. Alta California became a territory rather than a full state. The territorial capital remained in [[Monterey, California]], with a governor as executive official.\n\nMexico, after independence, was unstable with about [[List of heads of state of Mexico|40 changes of government]], in the 27 years prior to 1848\u2014an average government duration was 7.9 months. In Alta California, Mexico inherited a large, sparsely settled, poor, backwater province paying little or no net tax revenue to the Mexican state. In addition, Alta California had a declining Mission system as the [[Spanish Missions of California|Mission]] Indian population in Alta California continued to rapidly decrease.\n\nThe number of Alta California settlers, always a minority of total population, slowly increased mostly by more births than deaths in the Californio population in California. After the closure of the [[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail|de Anza Trail]] across the [[Colorado River]] in 1781 immigration from Mexico was nearly all by ship. California continued to be a sparsely populated and isolated country.\n\n====Trade policy====\nEven before Mexico gained control of [[Alta California]] the onerous Spanish rules against trading with foreigners began to break down as the declining Spanish fleet could not enforce their no-trading policies. The settlers, and their descendants (who became known as [[Californio]]s), were eager to trade for new commodities, finished goods, luxury goods, and other merchandise. The Mexican government abolished the no trade with foreign ships policy and soon regular trading trips were being made.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/>\n\nIn addition, a number of Europeans and Americans became naturalized Mexican citizens and settled in early California. Some of those became rancheros and traders during the Mexican period, such as [[Abel Stearns]].\n\n[[California hide trade|Cattle hides and tallow]], along with [[North American fur trade|marine mammal fur]] and other goods, provided the necessary trade articles for mutually beneficial trade. The first American, English, and Russian [[California hide trade|trading ships]] first appeared in California a few years before 1820. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] provides a good first hand account of this trade. From 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year\u2014a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/>\n\nThe main [[Old Customhouse (Monterey, California)|port of entry]] for trading purposes was Monterey, where custom duties of up to 100% (also called [[tariffs]]) were applied. These high duties gave rise to much bribery and smuggling, as avoiding the tariffs made more money for the ship owners and made the goods less costly to the customers. Essentially all the cost of the California government (what little there was) was paid for by these tariffs. In this they were much like the United States in 1850, where about 89% of the revenue of its federal government came from import tariffs, although at an average rate of about 20%.<ref name=\"usgovernmentrevenue.com\">{{cite web|url=http://usgovernmentrevenue.com/index.php?year=1850#usgs302a|title=US Government Revenue, Deficit and Debt - Numbers Charts Analysis History|website=usgovernmentrevenue.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Mexico and the mission system====\nSo many mission Indians died from exposure to harsh conditions and diseases like measles, diphtheria, smallpox, syphilis, etc. that at times raids were undertaken to new villages in the interior to supplement the supply of Indian women. This increase in deaths was accompanied by a very low live birth rate among the surviving Indian population. As reported by Krell, as  of December 31, 1832, the mission [[Franciscan]] ''padres'' had performed a combined total of 87,787 baptisms and 24,529 marriages, and recorded 63,789 deaths.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\">Krell, Dorothy (ed.) (1979). ''The California Missions: A Pictorial History''; p. 316; Sunset Publishing Corporation, Menlo Park, California. {{ISBN|0-376-05172-8}}</ref>\n\nIf Krell's numbers are to be believed (others have very different numbers) the Mission Indian population had declined from a peak of about 87,000 in about 1800 to about 14,000 in 1832 and continued to decline. The Missions were becoming ever more strained as the number of Indian converts drastically declined and the deaths greatly exceeded the births. The ratio of Indian births to deaths is believed to have been less than 0.5 Indian births per death.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/>\n\nThe missions, as originally envisioned, were to last only about ten years before being converted to ''regular'' parishes. When the California missions were abolished in 1834 some [[Spanish missions in California|missions]] had existed over 66 years but the [[Spanish missions in California|Mission]] Indians were still not self-sufficient, proficient in Spanish, or wholly Catholic. Taking people from a hunter-gatherer type existence to an educated, agricultural-based existence was much more difficult than the missionaries had originally thought. The severe and continuing decline in Mission Indian populations exacerbated this problem. In 1834 Mexico, in response to demands that the Catholic Church give up much of the Mission property, started the process of [[Mexican secularization act of 1833|secularizing]] the [[Franciscan]] run [[Spanish missions in California|missions]]. [[Mission San Juan Capistrano]] was the very first to feel the effects of this legislation the following year when, on August 9, 1834 Governor Figueroa issued his \"Decree of Confiscation.\"<ref>Engelhardt, Zephyrin, O.F.M. (1922); ''San Juan Capistrano Mission'', p. 114, Standard Printing Co., Los Angeles, California</ref>\n\nNine other missions quickly followed, with six more in 1835; [[Mission San Buenaventura|San Buenaventura]] and San Francisco de As\u00eds were among the last to succumb, in June and December 1836, respectively.<ref>Yenne, Bill (2004). ''The Missions of California'', pp. 83, 93, Advantage Publishers Group, San Diego, California. {{ISBN|1-59223-319-8}}</ref> The [[Franciscan]]s soon thereafter abandoned most of the missions, taking with them almost everything of value they could, after which the locals typically plundered the mission buildings for construction materials, furniture, etc. or the mission buildings were sold off to serve other uses.\n\nIn spite of this neglect, the Indian towns at [[Mission San Juan Capistrano|San Juan Capistrano]], [[San Dieguito Complex|San Dieguito]], and [[Las Flores Estancia|Las Flores]] did continue on for some time under a provision in Governor Echeand\u00eda's 1826 Proclamation that allowed for the partial conversion of missions to new ''pueblos''.<ref>Robinson, W.W. (1948); ''Land in California'', p. 42, University of California Press, Berkeley and Los Angeles, California</ref> After the secularizing of the Missions, many of the surviving Mission Indians switched from being unpaid workers for the missions to unpaid laborers and vaqueros (cowboys) of the about 500 large Californio owned [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]].\n\n====Land grants====\nBefore Alta California became a part of the Mexican state, about 30 Spanish land grants had already been deeded in all of [[Alta California]] to Presidio soldiers and government officials and a few friends and family of the Alta California Governors, some of whom were grandchildren of the original 1775 Anza expedition settlers. The 1824 Mexican Colony Law established rules for petitioning for land grants in California; and by 1828, the rules for establishing land grants were codified in the Mexican Reglamento (Regulation). The Acts sought to break the monopoly of the Franciscan missions, while paving the way for additional settlers to California by making land grants easier to obtain.\n\nWhen the missions were secularized, the mission property and cattle were supposed to be mostly allocated to the missions Indians. In practice, nearly all mission property and livestock were taken over by the about 455 large [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] granted by the governors\u2014mostly to friends and family at low or no cost. The rancho owners claimed about {{convert|8600000|acre|km2}} averaging about {{convert|18900|acre|km2}} each. This land was nearly all distributed on former mission land within about {{convert|30|mi|km}} of the coast.\n\nThe Mexican land grants were provisional until settled and worked on for five years, and often had very  indefinite boundaries and sometimes conflicting ownership claims. The boundaries of each rancho were almost never surveyed, and marked, and often depended on local landmarks that often changed over time. Since the government depended on import tariffs for its income, there was virtually no property tax\u2014the property tax when introduced with U.S. statehood was a big shock. The grantee could not subdivide, or rent out, the land without approval.\n\nThe rancho owners tried to live in a grand manner, and the result was similar to a [[feudal barony|barony]]. For these few rancho owners and families, this was  California's Golden Age; for the vast majority it was not golden. Much of the agriculture, vineyards, and orchards established by the Missions were allowed to deteriorate as the rapidly declining Mission Indian population required less food, and the Missionaries and soldiers supporting the Missions disappeared. The new Ranchos and slowly increasing Pueblos mostly only grew enough food to eat and to trade with the occasional trading ship or [[Whaling in the United States|whaler]] that put into a California port to trade, get fresh water, replenish their firewood and obtain fresh vegetables.\n\nThe main products of these ranchos were [[leather|cattle hides]] (called California greenbacks) and [[tallow]] (rendered fat for making candles and soap) that were traded for other finished goods and merchandise. This hide-and-tallow trade was mainly carried on by Boston-based ships that traveled {{convert|14000|mi|km}} to {{convert|18000|mi|km}} around [[Cape Horn]] to bring finished goods and merchandise to trade with the Californio Ranchos for their hides and tallow. The cattle and horses that provided the hides and tallow essentially grew wild.\n\nBy 1845, the province of Alta California had a non-native population of about 1,500 Spanish and Latin American-born adult men along with about 6,500 women and their native-born children (who became the Californios). These Spanish-speakers lived mostly in the southern half of the state from San Diego north to Santa Barbara.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} There were also around 1300 American immigrants and 500 European immigrants from a wide variety of backgrounds. Nearly all of these were adult males and a majority lived in central and northern California from Monterey north to Sonoma and east to the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] foothills.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}\n\nA large non-coastal land grant was given to [[John Sutter]] who, in 1839, settled a large land grant close to the future city of [[Sacramento, California]], which he called \"[[New Helvetia]]\" (''New Switzerland''). There, he built an extensive fort equipped with much of the armament from [[Fort Ross]]\u2014bought from the Russians on credit when they abandoned that fort. [[Sutter's Fort]] was the first non-[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] community in the California [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. Sutter's Fort, from 1839 to about 1848, was a major agricultural and trade colony in California, often welcoming and assisting [[California Trail]] travelers to California. Most of the settlers at, or near, Sutter's Fort were new immigrants from the United States.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://linecamp.com/museums/americanwest/western_names/sutter_john/sutter_john.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990508055153/http://linecamp.com/museums/americanwest/western_names/sutter_john/sutter_john.html | url-status=dead | archive-date=1999-05-08 | title=John Sutter, Sutters Fort}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=485|title=Sutter''s Fort SHP|first=California State Parks, State of|last=California|website=CA State Parks|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\n====Annexation of California (1846\u20131847)====\n{{main|Conquest of California|Mexican\u2013American War}}\n<!--As I commented at the new article \"Conquest of California\", I have a problem with this wording. \"Conquest of California\" seems very non-neutral.

Several battles between U.S. and Mexican troops led the United States Congress to issue a declaration of war against Mexico on May 13, 1846; the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] had begun. Word of the conflict reached Alta California about a month later.\n\nThe main forces available to the United States in California were the bluejacket sailors and U.S. Marines on board the ships of the [[Pacific Squadron]]. Speculating that war with Mexico over Texas and other land was very possible, the [[U.S. Navy]] had sent several additional naval vessels to the Pacific in 1845 to protect U.S. interests there. It took about 200 days, on average, for ships to travel the greater than {{convert|17000|mi|km|adj=on}} trip from the East coast around [[Cape Horn]] of South America to California.\n\nInitially as the war with Mexico started there were five vessels in the U.S. Navy's Pacific Squadron near California. In 1846 and 1847 this was increased to 13 Navy vessels\u2014over half the U.S. Navy's available ships. The only other U.S. military force then in California was the about 30 military topographers etc. and 30 mountain men, guides, hunters, etc. in Captain [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]]'s [[Corps of Topographical Engineers|United States Army Corps of Topographical Engineers]] exploratory force. They were exiting California on their way to what is now [[Oregon]] when they got word in early June 1846 that war was imminent and a revolt had already started in [[Sonoma, California]]. Hearing rumors of possible Californio military action against the newly arrived settlers in California (this had already happened in 1840),<ref>Cleland, Robert Glass; ''A History of California'', The Macmillan Company 1922, p. 191 (Google eBook)</ref> some settlers decided to neutralize the small Californio garrison at Sonoma, California. On June 15, 1846, some thirty settlers, mostly American citizens, staged a revolt and seized the small Californio garrison, in Sonoma, without firing a shot and declared the new [[California Republic]] government. On hearing of this revolt, Fremont and his exploratory force returned to California. The \"republic\" never exercised any real authority and only lasted 26 days before accepting U.S. government control.\n\nThe former fleet surgeon William M. Wood and  John Parrot, the American Consul of [[Mazatl\u00e1n]], arrived in [[Guadalajara]], Mexico on May 10, 1846. There they heard word of the ongoing hostilities between the U.S. and Mexico forces and sent a message by special courier back to Commodore ([[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]]) [[John D. Sloat]], commander of the [[Pacific Squadron]] then visiting Mazatl\u00e1n Mexico. On May 17, 1846, this courier's  messages informed Commodore Sloat that hostilities between the U.S. and Mexico had commenced.<ref>Bancroft, Hubert H.; ''History of California'' Vol. XXII 1846\u20131848, p. 201, The History Company Publishers, San Francisco, 1882 (Google eBook)</ref>\n\nCommodore (Rear Admiral) John D.

They joined the sloop {{USS|Cyane|1837|2}} which was already there.<ref>Cleland, Robert Glass; ''The History of California'', p. 205, The Macmillan Company New York, 1922 (Google eBook)</ref> There were U.S. fears that the British might try to annex California to satisfy British creditors.<ref>Cleland, Robert Glass; ''The History of California'', p. 180, The Macmillan Company New York, 1922 (Google eBook)</ref> The British [[Pacific Station]]'s squadron of ships off California were stronger in ships, guns, and men than the American ships.<ref name=\"Bancroft, Hubert H. p. 199\"/> Apparently the British never had any orders on whether to interfere or not if hostilities broke out between The Californios and the United States and requesting new orders would have taken from one and a half and two years to get a message to England and back.\n\nInitially there was little resistance from anyone in California as they replaced the dysfunctional and ineffective Mexican government which had already been replaced by the Californios. The Mexican government by 1846 had already had 40 [[List of heads of state of Mexico|presidents]] in the first 24 years of its existence. Most new settlers and Californios were neutral or actively supported the revolt. An independent group of men called \"Los Osos\" raised the \"[[Bear Flag]]\" of the [[California Republic]] over Sonoma. The republic was in existence scarcely more than 25 days before Fr\u00e9mont returned and took over on June 23 from [[William B. Ide]] the leader of the [[Bear Flag Revolt]]. The California state flag of today is based on this original Bear Flag and still contains the words \"California Republic.\"[[John A. Sutter]] and his men and supplies at Sutter's Fort joined the revolt.\n\n====US capture of coastal ports and towns====\nIn 1846, the U.S. Navy was under orders to take over all California ports in the event of war. There were about 400 to 500 [[U.S. Marines]] and U.S. Navy bluejacket sailors available for possible land action on the Pacific Squadron's ships. Hearing word of the Bear Flag Revolt in Sonoma, California, and the arrival of the large British 2,600-ton, 600-man man-of-war {{HMS|Collingwood|1841|6}} flagship under Sir George S. Seymour, outside Monterey Harbor, Commodore Sloat was finally stirred to action. On July 7, 1846, seven weeks after war had been declared, Sloat instructed the captains of the ships {{USS|Savannah|1842|6}} and [[sloops-of-war|sloops]] {{USS|Cyane|1837|2}} and {{USS|Levant|1837|2}} of the [[Pacific Squadron]] in [[Monterey Bay]] to occupy [[Battle of Monterey|Monterey, California]]\u2014the Alta California capital. Fifty American marines and about 100 bluejacket sailors landed and captured the city without incident\u2014the few Californio troops formerly there having already evacuated the city. They raised the flag of the United States without firing a shot. The only shots fired were a 21-gun salute to the new U.S. flag fired by each of the U.S. Navy ships in the harbor.<ref>Bancroft, Hubert H.; ''History of California'' Vol. XXII 1846-1848, p. 252, The History Company Publishers, San Francisco, 1882 (Google eBook)</ref> The British ships observed but took no action.\n\nThe abandoned [[Presidio]] and [[Mission San Francisco de As\u00eds]] (Mission Dolores) at San Francisco, then called [[Yerba Buena, California|Yerba Buena]], were occupied without firing a shot on July 9, 1846, by U.S. marines and U.S. Navy sailors from the [[sloop-of-war|sloop]] {{USS|Portsmouth|1843|6}}. Militia Captain [[Thomas Fallon]] led a small force of about 22 men from [[Santa Cruz, California]], and captured the small town of [[History of San Jose, California|Pueblo de San Jose]] without bloodshed on July 11, 1846. Fallon received an American flag from Commodore John D. Sloat and raised it over the pueblo on July 14. On July 15, 1846, Commodore ([[Rear Admiral]]) Sloat transferred his command of the Pacific Squadron to Commodore [[Robert F. Stockton]] when Stockton's ship, the frigate {{USS|Congress|1841|6}}, arrived from the [[Hawaiian Islands|Sandwich Islands]] (Hawaii).\n\nStockton, a much more aggressive leader, asked Fremont to form a joint force of Fremont's soldiers, scouts, guides, and others, and a volunteer militia\u2014many who were former Bear Flag Revolters. This unit, called the [[California Battalion]], was mustered into U.S. service and were paid regular army wages. On July 19, Fr\u00e9mont's newly formed \"California Battalion\" swelled to about 160 men. These men included Fremont's 30 topographical men and their 30 scouts and hunters, U.S. Marine Lieutenant [[Archibald H. Gillespie]], a U.S. Navy officer to handle their two [[cannon]]s, a company of Indians trained by Sutter and many other ''permanent'' California settlers from several different countries as well as American settlers. The California Battalion members were used mainly to garrison and keep order in the rapidly surrendering California towns.\n\nThe Navy went down the coast from San Francisco, occupying ports without resistance as they went. The small pueblo (town) of [[History of San Diego|San Diego]] surrendered 29 July 1846 without a shot being fired. The small pueblo (town) of [[History of Santa Barbara|Santa Barbara]] surrendered without a shot being fired in August 1846.\n\n====Taking of Los Angeles====\nOn August 13, 1846, a joint force of U.S. Marines, bluejacket sailors and parts of Fr\u00e9mont's California Battalion carried by the {{USS|Cyane|1837|6}} entered Pueblo de Los Angeles, California with flags flying and band playing. USMC Captain Archibald H. Gillespie, (Fr\u00e9mont's second in command of the [[California Battalion]]), with an inadequate force of 40 to 50 men, were left to occupy and keep order in the largest town (about 3,500) in Alta California\u2014Los Angeles. The Californio government officials had already fled Alta California.\n\nIn September 1846 the Californios  [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Flores]], [[Jos\u00e9 Antonio Carrillo]] and [[Andr\u00e9s Pico]], organized and led a campaign of resistance against the American incursion into Los Angeles of the prior month.  As a result, the outnumbered United States troops evacuated the city for the following few months.  Over the following four months, U.S. forces fought minor skirmishes with the Californio Lancers in the [[Battle of San Pasqual|Battle of San Pasqual (in San Diego, California)]], the [[Battle of Dominguez Rancho|Battle of Dominguez Rancho (near Los Angeles)]], and the [[Battle of Rio San Gabriel|Battle of Rio San Gabriel (near Los Angeles)]]. After the Los Angeles resistance started, the American California Battalion was expanded to a force of about 400 men.\n\nIn early January 1847, a 600-man joint force of U.S. Marine, U.S. Navy bluejacket sailors, General [[Stephen W. Kearny]]'s 80 [[U.S. Army]] dragoons (cavalrymen), who had arrived over the Gila river trail in December 1846, and about two companies of Fremont's California Battalion re-occupied Los Angeles after some very minor skirmishes (mostly posturing)\u2014four months after the initial American retreat, the same U.S. flag again flew over Los Angeles. The minor armed resistance in California ceased when the Californios signed the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] on January 13, 1847. About 150 Californios who were worried about possible punishment from the Americans for not keeping their non-aggression promises rounded up about 300 horses and retreated into Sonora, Mexico over the [[Yuma Crossing]] [[Gila River]] trail. The Californios, who had wrested control of California from Mexico in 1845, now had a new and much more stable government.<ref name=\"calrepublic.tripod.com\">{{cite web|url=http://calrepublic.tripod.com/history.html|title=History of California including the Indians, Spanish, Californio, Bear Flag Republic, United States, and their flags.|website=Calrepublic.tripod.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] was signed in early 1847, the [[Pacific Squadron]] then went on to capture all [[Baja California]] cities and harbors and sink or capture all the [[Pacific Naval Force|Mexican Pacific Navy]] they could find. Baja California was returned to Mexico in subsequent [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] negotiations. California was under U.S. control by January 1847 and formally annexed and paid for by the U.S. in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] signed in 1848.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/americanhistory/hsus/reviews.htm|title=Home|website=[[Cambridge University Press]]|accessdate=7 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021135741/http://www.cambridge.org/us/americanhistory/hsus/reviews.htm|archive-date=2012-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n====Reinforcements arrive====\nAfter hostilities had ceased with the signing of the [[Treaty of Cahuenga]] on January 13, 1847, on January 22, 1847 Commodore Stockton's replacement, Commodore William B. Shubrick, showed up in Monterey in the [[razee]] {{USS|Independence|1814|6}} with 54 guns and about 500 crew members. On January 27, 1847 the transport ''Lexington'' showed up in Monterey, California with a regular [[U.S. Army]] [[artillery]] company of 113 men under Captain Christopher Tompkins.<ref>Harlow, Neal; ''California Conquered'', p. 247, University of California Press; 1989; {{ISBN|978-0-520-06605-2}}</ref>\n\nMore reinforcements of about 320 soldiers (and a few women) of the [[Mormon Battalion]] arrived at [[San Diego]] on January 28, 1847\u2014after hostilities had ceased. They had been recruited from the [[Mormon]] camps on the [[Missouri River]]\u2014about {{convert|2000|mi|km}} away. These troops were recruited with the understanding they would be discharged in California with their weapons. Most were discharged before July 1847. More reinforcements in the form of Colonel [[Jonathan D. Stevenson]]'s [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]] of about 648 men showed up in March\u2013April 1847\u2014again after hostilities had ceased. After desertions and deaths in transit, four ships brought Stevenson's 648 men to California. Initially they took over all of the Pacific Squadron's on-shore military and garrison duties and the Mormon Battalion and California Battalion's garrison duties.\n\nThe New York Volunteer companies were deployed from San Francisco in Alta California to [[La Paz, Baja California Sur|La Paz, Mexico]] in Baja California. The ship ''Isabella'' sailed from Philadelphia on 16 August 1847, with a detachment of one hundred soldiers, and arrived in California on 18 February 1848, the following year, at about the same time that the ship ''Sweden'' arrived with another detachment of soldiers. These soldiers were added to the existing companies of Stevenson's [[1st Regiment of New York Volunteers]]. Stevenson's troops were recruited with the understanding that they would be discharged in California. When gold was discovered in late January 1848, many of Stevenson's troops deserted.\n\nThe U.S. 1850 California Census asks state of birth of all residents and finds about 7300 residents that were born in California. The San Francisco, Contra Costa and Santa Clara county U.S. censuses were lost or burned in one of San Francisco's many fires. Adding the approximate 200 Hispanics in San Francisco (1846 directory) and an unknown (but small as shown in 1852 CA Census recount) number of Hispanics in Contra Costa and Santa Clara county in 1846 gives less than 8,000 Hispanics statewide in 1846 before hostilities commenced. The number of California Indians is unknown since they were not included in the 1850 census but has been roughly estimated to be between 50,000 and 150,000.\n\n====Military governor====\nAfter 1847, California was controlled (with much difficulty due to desertions) by a U.S. Army-appointed military governor and an inadequate force of a little over 600 troops. By 1850, California had grown to have a non-Indian and non-Californio population of over 100,000 due to the [[California Gold Rush]].<ref>U.S. 1850 California Census counts 92,597 residents but omits the residents of San Francisco (estimated at about 21,000) whose census records were destroyed by fire. Contra Costa County (estimated at about 2,000 residents) and Santa Clara County (estimated at about 4,000 residents) 1850 records were \"lost\" and also not included. The total non-Indian (Indians were not counted) population was over 120,000. See: \"Historical Statistical Abstracts - U.S. Census Bureau\"; [www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html]</ref> Despite a major conflict in the U.S. Congress on the number of slave versus non-slave states, the large, rapid and continuing California population gains and the large amount of gold being exported east gave California enough clout to choose its own boundaries, select its representatives, write its Constitution, and be admitted to the Union as a free state in 1850 without going through territorial status as required for most other states.\n\nThe [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] formally ended the Mexican\u2013American War in February 1848. For $15,000,000, and the assumption of U.S. debt claims against Mexico, the new state of Texas's boundary claims were settled, and [[New Mexico]], California, and the unsettled territory of several future states of the American Southwest were added to U.S. control.\n\nFrom 1847 to 1850, California had military governors appointed by the senior military commander in California. This arrangement was distinctly unsettling to the military, as they had no inclination, precedent, or training for setting up and running a government. President [[James K. Polk]] in office from March 4, 1845 \u2013 March 4, 1849, tried to get the 1848 Congress to make California a territory with a territorial government and again in 1849 but was unsuccessful in getting Congress to agree on the specifics of how this was to be done\u2014the issue was the number of free states vs. slave states.<ref>California and New Mexico: Message from the President of the United States.

Riley]] who had fought in the [[Siege of Veracruz]] and [[Chapultepec]] during the [[Mexican\u2013American War]] and considered an able military commander, was the last military governor of California in 1849\u20131850. In response to popular demand for a better more representative government, General Riley issued an official proclamation dated June 3, 1849, calling for a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] and an election of  representatives on August 1, 1849.\n[[File:Colton Hall.JPG|thumb|[[Colton Hall]] in Monterey, site of California's 1849 [[Constitutional Convention (California)|Constitutional Convention]]]]\n\n==== California Constitutional Convention (1849) ====\nConvention delegates were chosen by secret ballot but lacking any census data as to California's population and where they lived its representatives only roughly approximated the rapidly changing state population as later shown in the 1850 U.S. California Census taken a year later.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041229215830/http://www.census.gov/prod/www/abs/statab.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=29 December 2004|title=Statistical Abstracts|date=29 December 2004|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> The 48 delegates chosen were mostly pre-1846 American settlers; eight were native born Californios who had to use interpreters.

There were four other significant differences from the U.S. Constitution. The [[California Constitution|convention]] chose the boundaries for the state\u2014unlike most other territories, whose boundaries were set by Congress (Article XII). Article IX encouraged statewide education and provided for a system of common schools partially funded by the state and provided for the establishment of a University (University of California). The California version outlawed slavery, except as punishment (Article I Sec. 18) and dueling (Article XI Sec.2) and gave women and wives the right to own and control their own property (Article XI Sec. 14).\n\nThe [[debt limit]] for the state was set at $300,000 (Article VIII). Like all other states they guaranteed the rights of citizens to sue in Civil court to uphold the rights of contracts and property (Article I Sec. 16). They created a court system with a supreme court with judges who had to be confirmed every 12 years.(Article VI) They set up the states original 29 counties (Article I Sec. 4), created a legislature of two houses, set up polling places to vote, set up uniform taxation rules. The 1849 Constitution guaranteed the right to vote to \"Every citizen of California, declared a legal voter by this Constitution, and every citizen of the United States, a resident of this State on the day of election, shall be entitled to vote at the first general election under this Constitution, and on the question of the adoption thereof (Article XII Sec. 5)\".<ref name=\"Richard B.

Almost all (~96%) were young men. [[Women in the California Gold Rush]] were few and had many opportunities to do new things and take on new tasks. [[Argonauts]], as they were often called, walked over the [[California Trail]] or came by sea. About 80,000 Argonauts arrived in 1849 alone\u2014about 40,000 over the California trail and 40,000 by sea.\n\nSan Francisco was designated the official [[port of entry]] for all California ports where U.S. customs (also called [[tariffs]] and [[Ad valorem tax]]es) (averaging about 25%) were collected by the Collector of Customs from all ships bearing foreign goods. The first Collector of customs was Edward H. Harrison, appointed by General Kearny. Shipping boomed from the average of about 25 vessels from 1825 to 1847<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/> to about 793 ships in 1849 and 803 ships in 1850.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/inport/1849.htm|title=1849.

Passengers disembarking in San Francisco had one of the easier accesses to the gold country since they could take another ship from there to get to Sacramento and several other towns.\n\nSan Francisco shipping boomed, and wharves and piers had to be developed to handle the onslaught of cargo--''Long Wharf'' was probably the most prominent. To meet the demands of the Gold Rush, ships bearing food, liquors of many types, tools, hardware, clothing, complete houses, lumber, building materials, etc. as well as farmers, entrepreneurs, prospective miners, gamblers, entertainers and [[Women in the California Gold Rush|prostitutes]], etc. from around the world came to San Francisco.

The Californios initially prospered, as there was a sudden increase in the demand for livestock. These food shipments changed mainly to shipments from Oregon and internal shipments in California as agriculture was developed in both states.\n\nStarting in 1849, many of the ship crews jumped ship and headed for the gold fields when they reached port. Soon [[San Francisco Bay]] had many hundreds of abandoned ships anchored offshore. The better ships were recrewed and put back in the shipping and passenger business. Others were bought ''cheap'' and hauled up on the mud flats and used as [[store ship]]s, saloons, temporary stores, floating warehouses, homes, and a number of other uses. Many of these repurposed ships were partially destroyed in one of San Francisco's many fires and ended up as landfill to expand the available land. The population of San Francisco exploded from about 200 in 1846 to 36,000 in the 1852 California Census.<ref>San Francisco Population 794-2000 {{cite web|url=http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |title=San Francisco History - Population |accessdate=2014-02-14 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004055802/http://www.sfgenealogy.com/sf/history/hgpop.htm |archivedate=2013-10-04 }} Accessed 4 April 2011</ref>\n\nIn San Francisco, many people were initially housed in wooden houses, ships hauled up on the mud flats to serve as homes or businesses, wood-framed canvas tents used for saloons, hotels and boarding houses as well as other flammable structures. All these canvas and wood structures, combined with a lot of drunken gamblers and miners, led almost inevitably to many fires. Most of San Francisco burned down six times in six ''Great Fires'' between 1849 and 1852.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist1/fire.html|title=Early History of the San Francisco Fire Department|website=Sfmuseum.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:SanFranciscoharbor1851c sharp.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Merchant ships fill San Francisco harbor in 1850 or 1851]]\n\n''[[Californio]]s'' who lived in California had finally had enough of the Mexican government and seized control of the territory of [[Alta California]] in 1846.<ref name=\"calrepublic.tripod.com\"/> At the time gold was discovered in 1848, California had about 9,000<ref>The 1850 U.S. Census of California found 7,600 people who claimed they were born in California (Californios).

When the much faster [[clipper ship]]s began to be used starting in early 1849, they could complete this journey in an average of only 120 days; but they typically carried few passengers. They specialized in high value freight. Nearly all freight to California was carried by regular sailing vessels\u2014they were slow but the cheapest way to ship cargo. Starting about 1850 many travelers to California took steamboats to Panama or Nicaragua, crossed the [[Isthmus of Panama]] or Nicaragua and caught another steamboat to California. In California other smaller steamboats hauled miners from [[San Francisco, California]] up the [[Sacramento River]] to [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. [[Marysville, California]] etc. This trip could be done in 40\u201360 days\u2014depending on connections. Returning miners and/or their gold nearly all reversed this route to return to the East Coast.\n\nThose who took the [[California Trail]] usually left [[Missouri River]] towns in early April and arrived in California 150\u2013170 days later\u2014late August or early September. Mostly, farmers etc. who lived in the Mid-west and already had wagons and teams took the California trail. Some winter wagon traffic came over the [[Gila River]] ([[Juan Bautista de Anza National Historic Trail|De Anza Trail]]) and routes that included parts of the [[Old Spanish Trail (trade route)|Old Spanish Trail]]. About half the Argonauts to California came by wagon on one of these routes.\n\n====Gold Rush effects====\nStarting in 1848 before gold in California was even confirmed, Congress had contracted with the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] to set up regular [[paddle steamer]] [[packet ship]], mail, passenger and cargo routes in the Pacific Ocean. This was to be a regular route from [[Panama]], [[Nicaragua]] and Mexico to and from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Oregon|Oregon]]. The Atlantic Ocean mail contract from East Coast cities and [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] to and from the [[Chagres River]] in [[Panama]] was won by the [[United States Mail Steamship Company]] whose first steamship, the ''SS Falcon (1848')'' was dispatched on December 1, 1848. The [[SS California (1848)]], the first [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] [[steamship]], showed up in San Francisco loaded with gold seekers on February 28, 1849 on its first trip from Panama and Mexico after steaming around [[Cape Horn]] from [[History of New York (state)|New York]]. Once the [[California Gold Rush]] was confirmed, other paddle steamers soon followed on both the Pacific and Atlantic routes. By late 1849 [[paddle steamer]]s like the ''SS McKim (1848)''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/ships/ss.html|title=Page moved. Automatic redirect.|website=Maritimeheritage.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> were carrying miners and business men over the {{convert|125|mi|km}} trip from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] up the [[Sacramento River]] to [[History of Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Marysville, California]]. Steam powered [[tugboat]]s started working in the [[San Francisco Bay]] soon after this.\n\nAgriculture expanded throughout the state to meet the food needs of the new settlers. Agriculture was soon found to be limited by the difficulty of finding enough water in the right places to grow irrigated crops. Winter wheat planted in the fall and harvested in the spring was one early crop that grew well without irrigation. At the beginning of the Gold Rush, there was no written law regarding property rights in the goldfields, and a system of \"staking claims\" was developed by the miners. The Gold Rush also had negative effects: [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] were pushed off of traditional lands and massacred<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2016/08/26/california-native-americans-genocide-490824.html|title=California's state-sanctioned genocide of Native Americans|date=17 August 2016|website=Newsweek.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> and [[gold mining]] caused environmental harm.\n\nIn the early years of the California Gold Rush, [[placer mining]] methods were used, from panning to \"cradles\" and \"rockers\" or \"long-toms\", to diverting the water from an entire river into a [[sluice]] alongside the river, and then digging for gold in the gravel down to the rocky river bottom. This placer gold had been freed by the slow disintegration, over geological time, that freed the gold from its ore. This free gold was typically found in the cracks in the rocks found at the bottom of the gravel found in rivers or creeks, as the gold typically worked down through the gravel or collected in stream bends or bottom cracks. Some 12-million ounces<ref>The [[Troy weight]] system is traditionally used to measure precious metals, not the more familiar [[avoirdupois|avoirdupois weight]] system. The term \"ounces\" of gold typically refers to troy ounces. There are some historical uses where, because of the age of the use, the intention is ambiguous.</ref> (370&nbsp;[[metric ton|t]]) of gold were removed in the first five years of the Gold Rush. This gold greatly increased the available money in the United States, which was on the [[gold standard]] at that time\u2014the more gold you had, the more you could buy.\n\nAs the easier gold was recovered, the mining became much more capital and labor-intensive as the hard rock quartz mining, hydraulic mining, and dredging mining evolved. By the mid-1880s, it is estimated that 11-million ounces (340&nbsp;t) of gold (worth approximately US$6.6&nbsp;billion at November 2006 prices) had been recovered via \"hydraulicking,\" a style of [[hydraulic mining]] that later spread around the world, despite its drastic environmental consequences. By the late 1890s, [[dredging]] technology had become economical,<ref name=RawlsDredge>Rawls, James J. and Orsi, Richard (eds.) (1999), p. 199.</ref> and it is estimated that more than 20&nbsp;million ounces (620&nbsp;t) were recovered by dredging (worth approximately US$12&nbsp;billion at November 2006 prices). Both during the Gold Rush and in the decades that followed, hard-rock mining wound up being the single-largest source of gold produced in the [[Gold Country]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3014/ |title=Mercury Contamination from Historical Gold Mining in California |accessdate=2008-02-26 |author1=Charles N.

The greatly increased population, along with the new wealth of gold, caused: roads, bridges, farms, mines, steamship lines, businesses, [[western saloon|saloons]], gambling houses, boarding houses, churches, schools, towns, mercury mines, and other components of a rich modern (1850) U.S. culture to be built. The sudden growth in population caused many more towns to be built throughout Northern, and later Southern, California and the few existing towns to be greatly expanded. The first cities started showing up as [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Sacramento|Sacramento]] exploded in population.\n\n====Effects on indigenous population====\nMost California Indians are thought to have been located near the coast, the same areas the Spanish Missions were established. Since California Indians had no agriculture before it was introduced by the [[Franciscan]] padres, they were strictly [[hunter-gatherer]] society tribes which could not support large populations\u2014large populations require agriculture. During the Spanish and Mexican California occupation period nearly all coastal tribes south of San Francisco were induced to join a mission. So many Mission Indians died from exposure to harsh conditions at the missions and diseases like measles, diphtheria, smallpox, syphilis, etc. that at times raids were undertaken to new villages in the interior to supplement the supply of Indian women at the missions. As reported by Krell, as  of December 31, 1832, the mission Franciscan ''padres'' from 1800 to 1830 had performed a combined total of 87,787 baptisms and 24,529 marriages, and recorded 63,789 deaths.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/> If Krell's numbers are to be believed (others have slightly different numbers) the Mission Indian population had declined from a peak of about 87,000 in about 1800 to about 14,000 in 1832 and continued to decline. The Missions were becoming ever more strained as the number of Indian converts drastically declined and the deaths greatly exceeded the births. The ratio of Indian births to deaths is believed to have been less than 0.5 Indian births per death.<ref name=\"Krell, Dorothy 1979 p. 316\"/> After the missions were disbanded in 1832 the surviving Indians mostly went to work on the about 500 newly established [[Ranchos of California|ranchos]] who appropriated the mission's \"property\" (about {{convert|1000000|acre|ha}} acres/mission). The Indians typically worked  at one of the four Spanish pueblos as servants or at the newly established ranchos for room and board or attempted to join other tribes in the interior. The new ranchos occupied nearly all their original tribal territories.\n\nThe new wave of immigration that was sparked by the gold rush would continue to have a disastrous impact on California's native population, which continued to precipitously decline mainly due to Eurasian diseases to which they had no natural immunity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617 |title=Destruction of the California Indians |publisher=[[California Secretary of State]] |accessdate=2012-04-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111207115225/http://www.learncalifornia.org/doc.asp?id=1617 |archivedate=2011-12-07 }}</ref> Like when the [[Spanish missions in California]] were established the native inhabitants were often forcefully removed from their traditional tribal lands by incoming miners, ranchers, and farmers. There were a number of massacres, including the [[Yontoket massacre]], the [[Bloody Island massacre]] at Clear Lake, and the Old Shasta Massacre, in which hundreds of indigenous people were killed. Thousands more are thought to have died due to disease. Combined with a low birth rate for Indian women the Indian population precipitously declined.\n\nBetween 1850 and 1860, the state of California paid around 1.5 million dollars (some $250,000 of which was reimbursed by the federal government)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/MilitiaandIndians.html|title=California Militia and Expeditions Against the Indians, 1850 - 1859|website=Militarymuseum.org|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> to hire \"militias\" whose purpose was to protect settlers from the indigenous populations. These \"private military forays\" were involved in several of the above-mentioned massacres, and sometimes participated in the \"wanton killing\" of Native peoples. The first governor of California, [[Peter Burnett]], openly called for the extermination of the Indian tribes, and in reference to the violence against California's Native population, he said, \"That a war of extermination will continue to be waged between the two races until the Indian race becomes extinct, must be expected. While we cannot anticipate the result with but painful regret, the inevitable destiny of the race is beyond the power and wisdom of man to avert.\"<ref name=\"cabrillo.edu\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cabrillo.edu/~crsmith/anth6_americanperiod.html|title=INDIANS of CALIFORNIA - American Period|website=Cabrillo.edu|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> As a result, the rise of modern California equalled great tragedy and hardship for the native inhabitants.

Following the split in the Democratic Party in 1860, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] supporters of Lincoln took control of the state in 1861, minimizing the influence of the large southern population. Their great success was in obtaining a Pacific railroad land grant and authorization to build the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] as the western half of the transcontinental railroad.\n\nCalifornia was settled primarily by [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Southern United States|Southern]] farmers, miners, and businessmen. Though the southerners and some Californios tended to favor the Confederacy, the state did not have slavery, and they were generally powerless during the war itself. They were prevented from organizing and their newspapers were closed down by denying them the use of the mail. Former Sen. [[William M. Gwin]], a Confederate sympathizer, was arrested and fled to Europe.\n\nNearly all of the men who volunteered as Union soldiers stayed in the West, within the [[Department of the Pacific]], to guard forts and other facilities, occupy secessionist regions, and fight Indians in the state and the western territories. Some 2,350 men in the [[California Column]] marched east across Arizona in 1862 to expel the Confederates from Arizona and New Mexico. The California Column then spent most of the remainder of the war fighting hostile Indians in the area.\n\n====Early California transportation====\nEven before Mexico gained control of [[Alta California]] in 1821, the onerous Spanish rules in effect from 1770 to 1821 against trading with foreigners began to break down as the declining Spanish fleet couldn't enforce their no trading policies. The Californios, with essentially no industries or manufacturing capabilities, were eager to trade for new commodities, glass, hinges, nails, finished goods, luxury goods and other merchandise. The Mexican government abolished the no trade with foreign ships policy and soon regular trading trips were being made. The main products of these [[Ranchos of California|California Ranchos]] were [[leather|cow hides]] (called California greenbacks), [[tallow]] (rendered fat for making candles and soap) and [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|California/Texas longhorn cattle]] horns<ref>{{cite web | title=California Longhorns Vs. Texas Longhorns of Yesteryear and Today - A Comparative Study | author=Michael Casey | url=http://www.fairlealonghorns.com/Default.aspx?ID=566&Title=CaliforniavsTexasLonghorns | publisher=Fairlea Longhorns | accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> that were traded for other finished goods and merchandise. This hide-and-tallow trade was mainly carried on by Boston-based ships that traveled for about 200 days in [[sailing ship]]s about {{convert|17000|mi|km}} to {{convert|18000|mi|km}} around [[Cape Horn]] to bring finished goods and merchandise to trade with the Californio Ranchos for their hides, tallow and horns. The cattle and horses that provided the hides, tallow and horns essentially grew wild. The Californios' hides, tallow and horns provided the necessary trade articles for a mutually beneficial trade. The first United States, English and Russian trading ships began showing up in California before 1816. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] written about 1832 provides a good first hand account of this trade.,<ref name=\"Dana, Richard 2010\">Dana, Richard; ''Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea'' Republished by CreateSpace (2010)  {{ISBN|978-1-4564-7282-5}}</ref><ref>Google eBook [https://archive.org/details/twoyearsbeforem01smitgoog ''Two Years Before the Mast: A Personal Narrative of Life at Sea''] accessed 9 February 2012</ref>\n\nFrom 1825 to 1848 the average number of ships traveling to California increased to about 25 ships per year\u2014a large increase from the average of 2.5 ships per year from 1769 to 1824.<ref name=\"sfgenealogy.com\"/> The port of entry for trading purposes was the Alta California Capital, [[Monterey, California]], where custom duties ([[tariff]]s) of about 100% were applied. These high duties gave rise to much bribery and smuggling, as avoiding the tariffs made more money for the ship owners and made the goods less costly to the customers. Essentially all the cost of the California government (what little there was) was paid for by these tariffs (custom duties). In this they were much like the United States in 1850, where about 89% of the revenue of its federal government came from import tariffs (also called Customs or [[ad valorem tax]]es), although at an average rate of about 20%.<ref name=\"usgovernmentrevenue.com\"/>\n\nShips after 1848 provided easy, cheap, links among the coastal towns within California and on routes leading there. Nearly all cargo to California came by [[sailing ship]] until the completion of the [[first Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. The sea route was more than {{convert|17000|mi|km}} route from the east coast or Europe around [[Cape Horn]] in [[South America]]. This route averaged about 200 days by \"standard\" [[sailing ship]] or about 120 days by [[Clipper]]. One of the main problems that occurred during the gold rush was the lack of a paying cargo for ships leaving California. Food, supplies and passengers were the main cargo coming to California; but there were only a limited return trade of returning passengers, mail and gold. Many of the sailing ships that arrived in [[San Francisco Bay]] were abandoned there or converted into warehouses or landfill.\n\nThe Panama and Nicaragua routes provided a shortcut for getting from the East Coast to California and a brisk maritime passenger trade developed, featuring fast [[paddle steamer]]s from cities on the east coast, [[New Orleans, Louisiana]] and [[Havana]] Cuba to the Caribbean mouth of the [[Chagres River]] in Panama and the mouth of [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] in Nicaragua. After a trip up the Chagres River by native dugouts the last {{convert|20|mi|km}} were completed to Panama City by mule back. The trip up the San Juan River in Nicaragua was usually done by small steam launch to [[Lake Nicaragua]], a boat trip on the lake and a final {{convert|25|mi|km}} trip by stage coach or mule back to [[San Juan del Sur]] or other city in the Pacific side of Nicaragua. After 1855 when the Panama Railroad was completed the Nicaragua route largely shut down.\n\nIn 1846 the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] was settled with [[Great Britain]] and California was under U.S. control in 1847 and annexed and paid for in 1848. The United States was now a Pacific Ocean power. Starting in 1848 the [[U.S. Congress]], after the annexation of California but before the [[California Gold Rush]] was confirmed there, had subsidized the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]] with $199,999 to set up regular [[packet ship]], mail, passenger and cargo routes in the Pacific Ocean. This was to be a regular scheduled route from [[Panama City]], Nicaragua and [[Mexico]] to and from [[History of San Francisco|San Francisco]] and [[History of Oregon|Oregon]]. Panama City was the Pacific terminus of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] trail across Panama. The Atlantic Ocean mail contract from East Coast cities and [[New Orleans]] to and from the mouth of the [[Chagres River]] in [[Isthmus of Panama]] was won by the [[United States Mail Steamship Company]] whose first [[paddle wheel]] steamship, the SS Falcon (1848) was dispatched on 1 December 1848 to the Caribbean (Atlantic) terminus of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] trail\u2014the [[Chagres River]].\n\nIn 1849 [[William H. Aspinwall]], the man who had won the bid for the building and operating of the Pacific mail steamships, conceived a plan to construct a railway across the [[isthmus of Panama]]; he and his partners created a company registered in New York, the [[Panama Railroad Company]], raised US$1,000,000 from the sale of stock, and hired companies to conduct engineering and route studies. Their venture happened to be well-timed, as the discovery of gold in California in January 1848 created a rush of emigrants wanting to cross the Isthmus of Panama and go on to California or return home. [[Cholera]], [[yellow fever]], and [[malaria]] took a deadly toll on the Railroad workers, and despite the continual importation of large numbers of new workers, there were times when the work stalled for simple lack of alive and semi-fit workers. All railroad supplies and nearly all foodstuffs had to be imported from thousands of miles away, greatly adding to the cost of construction. Laborers came from the United States, the [[Caribbean]] Islands, and as far away as Ireland, India, China, and Australia.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/cu31924021538214/page/n34 <!-- pg=21 -->  Fessenden Nott Otis, '''Isthmus of Panama: History of the Panama railroad; and of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company''', Harper & Brothers, New York, 1867 pp. 21-36.]</ref> Upon completion in 1855 the road stretched {{convert|47|mi|km}} and had cost over $8,000,000 and about 5,000 lives.

This was before the gold strikes in California were confirmed and she left with only a partial passenger load in her 60 saloon (about $300 fare) and 150 steerage (about $150 fare) passenger compartments. Only a few were going all the way to California.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.maritimeheritage.org/PassLists/ca022849.htm | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19990424163308/http://www.maritimeheritage.org/PassLists/ca022849.htm | url-status=dead | archive-date=1999-04-24 | title=The Maritime Heritage Project Passenger Lists}}</ref> As word of the gold strikes spread, the {{SS|California|1848|6}} picked up more passengers in [[Valparaiso]] [[Chile]] and [[Panama City]] [[Panama]] and showed up in San Francisco on 28 February 1849. She was loaded with about 400 gold seeking passengers; twice the number of passengers it had been designed for. In San Francisco all her passengers and crew except the captain and one man deserted the ship and it would take the Captain two more months to gather a much better paid return crew to return to Panama city an establish the route they had been contracted for. Many more paddle steamers were soon running from the east coast cities to the [[Chagres River]] in Panama and the [[San Juan River (Nicaragua)|San Juan River]] in Nicaragua. By the mid 1850s there were over ten Pacific and ten Atlantic/Caribbean paddle wheel steamboats shuttling high valued freight like passengers, gold and mail between California and both the Pacific and Caribbean ports. The trip to the east coast could be executed after about 1850 in as short as 40 days if all ship connections could be met with a minimum of waiting.\n\nSteamboats plied the Bay Area and the [[Sacramento River|Sacramento]] and [[San Joaquin River]]s that flowed nearer the goldfields, moving passengers and supplies from San Francisco to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], [[Marysville, California|Marysville]] and [[Stockton, California]]\u2014the three main cities supplying the gold fields. The city of Stockton, on the lower San Joaquin, quickly grew from a sleepy backwater to a thriving trading center, the stopping-off point for miners headed to the gold fields in the foothills of the Sierra. Rough ways such as the Millerton Road which later became the [[Stockton - Los Angeles Road]]<ref>Hoover and Kyle, p. 376</ref> quickly extended the length of the valley and were served by mule teams and covered wagons.<ref>{{cite web | last=Coate | first=Bill | title=Last blast from steamers on the San Joaquin | url=http://www.maderatribune.com/life/lifeview.asp?c=100216 | publisher=Madera Tribune | date=March 16, 2003 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024843/http://www.maderatribune.com/life/lifeview.asp?c=100216 | archivedate=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> [[Riverboat]] navigation quickly became an important transportation link on the San Joaquin River, and during the \"June Rise\",<ref>Rose, p. 54</ref> as boat operators called the San Joaquin's annual high water levels during snow melt, on a wet year large craft could make it as far upstream as Fresno.

Soon a system of wagon roads, bridges, ferries and toll roads were set up many of them maintained by tolls collected from the users. Large freight wagons pulled by up to 10 mules replaced pack trains, and toll roads built and kept passable by the tolls made it easier to get to the mining camps, enabling express companies to deliver firewood, lumber, food, equipment, clothes, mail, packages, etc. to the miners. Later when communities developed in Nevada some steamboats were even used to haul cargo up the [[Colorado River]] as high as where [[Lake Mead]] in Nevada is today.\n\n[[File:Butterfield-Overland.gif|thumb|500px|''The stage routes from a Butterfield Overland Mail Company map.'']]\n\nThe '''[[Butterfield Overland Mail]] Stage Line''' <ref>Also known as the '''Oxbow Route''', the '''Butterfield Overland Stage''', or the '''Butterfield Stage'''</ref> was a [[stagecoach]] service  operating from 1857 to 1861 of over {{convert|2800|mi|km}}.

An [[Act of Congress]], approved March 2, 1861, discontinued this route and service ceased June 30, 1861. On the same date the central route from St. Joseph, Missouri, to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]], [[Carson City, Nevada]] and on to [[Placerville, California]], went into effect. From the end of Central Overland route in [[Carson City, Nevada]] they followed the Placerville Toll road route over Johnson Pass (now [[U.S. Route 50 in California|U.S. Highway 50]]) to California since it was the fastest and only route that was then kept open in winter across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]] mountains.<ref name=\"Root, p. 42\">Root, ''The Overland Stage to California'', p. 42:</ref> The 1800 draft horses and mules, 250 coaches, etc., on the southern [[Gila River]] route Butterfield Stage route were pulled off and moved to the new route between [[St. Joseph, Missouri]] and [[Placerville, California]] along the existing [[Oregon Trail|Oregon]], [[California Trail]]s to Salt Lake City and then through central Utah and Nevada. On 30 June 1861 the ''[[Central Nevada Route|Central Overland California Route]]'' from [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], to [[Placerville, California]], went into effect. By traveling day and night and using team changes about every {{convert|10|mile|km}} the stages could make the trip in about 28 days. News paper correspondents reported that they had a preview of \"hell\" when they took the trip.<ref name=\"Root, p. 42\"/>\n\nOnce cargo was moved off the ocean and rivers it nearly always transported by horse or ox drawn wagons\u2014still true till about 1920. When there was not a wagon trail the cargo was shifted to mule pack trains or carried on the backs of the miners. Lumber to build new homes, sluice boxes, etc. was a crying need and food to feed the miners was needed even more. However, California has a lot of native timber and even as early as 1850 there were saw mills set up to turn some of this timber into lumber. Food was initially imported from any and all west coast ports from Hawaii, Oregon or Mexico where it could be obtained. The lumber and food were transported by ships that had initially carried gold rush passengers and in many cases abandoned in the bay and could usually be bought cheap. The many goods the gold miners needed for a \"modest\" 1850s lifestyle were nearly always hauled by horse, mule or ox drawn wagons. Wheat and timber were early products from Oregon and the [[Columbia River]] area that could be economically imported. Soon it was found that some types of spring wheat could be planted in the fall in California and the mild winter with its rains would allow good crops to be harvested in the spring without irrigation. Later. much of this wheat was exported to ports around the world, California finally had a return cargo for its many incoming ships. California in the 1890s became the foremost wheat producer in the U.S. but could not really compete on the east coast with the burgeoning wheat lands being brought into production in the midwest were much closer to their markets. Other crops in California were usually found to be much more profitable and California joined the rest of the nation in importing most of its wheat from farms in the midwest.\n\nThe year 1848 saw the close of Mexican control over Alta California, this period also marked the beginning of the [[Ranchos of California|rancheros']] greatest prosperity. The Californio rancho society before 1848 had few resources except large herds of [[Texas longhorn (cattle)|Longhorn cattle]] which grew almost wild in California. The Ranchos produced the largest [[cowhide]] (called California Greenbacks) and [[tallow]] business in North America by killing and skinning their cattle and cutting off their fat. The cowhides were staked out to dry and the tallow was put in large cowhide bags. The rest of the animal was left to rot or feed the California [[grizzly bear]]s then common in California. The traders who traded for the hides, tallow and sometimes horns hauled them back to the east coast where the hides were used to make a large variety of leather products, most of the tallow was used for making candles and the horns were mostly used for making buttons. A trading trip typically took over two years. The classic book ''[[Two Years Before the Mast]]'' (originally published 1840) by [[Richard Henry Dana, Jr.]] gives a good  first-hand account of a two-year [[sailing ship]] [[sea]] trading voyage to California which he took in 1834\u20135. Dana mentions that they also took back a large shipment of [[Texas Longhorn (cattle)|California longhorn]] horns. Horns were used to make a large number of items in this time period. (The eBook of ''Two Years Before the Mast'' is available at Gutenberg project.)<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/4277?msg=welcome_stranger|title=Two Years Before the Mast by Richard Henry Dana|website=Gutenberg.org|accessdate=7 November 2017|date=July 2003}}</ref> A large part of the Californio diet was beef, but since there was no easy way to preserve it most of the time another animal was killed when fresh meat was needed as when visitors showed up\u2014the hides and tallow could be salvaged and very little was lost. The market for beef dramatically changed with the onset of the [[California Gold Rush|Gold Rush]], as thousands of miners, businessmen and other fortune seekers flooded into northern California. These newcomers needed meat, and cattle prices soared from the $1.00 to $2.00 per hide to $30.00-$50.00 per cow. From about 1848 to about 1860 the rancheros enjoyed the \"golden\" days of Hispanic California. The largely illiterate ranchero owners lost nearly all their land to a few bad years for cattle in the 1860s and the many mortgages they had taken out to finance a \"prosperous\" life style and could no longer pay back.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mchsmuseum.com/cattle.html|title=Monterey County Historical Society, Local History Pages--The California Cattle Boom, 1849-1862|website=Mchsmuseum.com|accessdate=7 November 2017}}</ref> In the early years of the Gold Rush the demand for beef was so great that there are records of about 60,000 longhorns being herded from Texas to California.<ref>Hutchinson, W.

These combined stage and Pony Express stations along the Central Route across Utah and Nevada were joined by the [[first transcontinental telegraph]] stations (completed 24 October 1861). The Pony express terminated soon after the telegraph was established. This combination wagon-stagecoach-pony express-telegraph line route is labeled the ''Pony Express National Historic Trail'' on the National Trail Map.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pony Express Trail map |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/recreation/programs/trails/natltrails.pdf|website=Fs.fed.us|accessdate=28 January 2009}}</ref> From Salt Lake City, the telegraph line followed much of the Mormon-California-Oregon trail(s) to Omaha, Nebraska. After the [[first transcontinental railroad]] was completed in 1869, the telegraph lines along the railroad tracks became the main line, since the required relay stations, lines and telegraph operators were much easier to supply and maintain along the railroad. The telegraph lines that diverged from the railroad lines or significant population centers were largely abandoned.\n\nAfter the 1870s, stagecoaches provided the primary form of local passenger and mail transportation between inland towns that were not connected to a railroad, with sailing ships and [[paddle wheel]] steamships connecting port cities. Freight wagons still hauled nearly all cargo. Even when railroads arrived, stages were essential to link more remote areas to the railheads. Top of the line in quality, with crowded discomfort, was the nine-passenger [[Concord stagecoach]], but the cheaper, rougher \"mud wagons\" were also in general use. The [[Wells Fargo]] company contracted with independent lines to deliver its express packages and transport gold bullion and coins. Stagecoach travel was usually uncomfortable as passengers were often crowded together in limited space, dust pouring through open windows from rough unpaved roads, rough rides, un-bathed fellow passengers and poorly sprung steel tired [[stagecoach]]es. Some drivers were famous for their skill in driving six horses down winding roads at top speed, only rarely overturning. Rate competition from competing stage lines reduced fares to as little a two cents per mile on some routes\u2014a $1.00/day was then a common wage. Bandits found robbing coaches a profitable if risky venture as they may be shot or hanged if caught. U.S. government mail subsidies provided essential base income for many stage lines, but running a stage line was often a financially unstable business enterprise.\n\n====Railroads====\n[[File:East and West Shaking hands at the laying of last rail Union Pacific Railroad - Restoration.jpg|thumb|Workers drive in the [[golden spike]] on the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]], 1869]]\n{{Main|History of rail transportation in California}}\n\nCalifornia's first railroad was built from Sacramento to Folsom, California starting in February 1855.

The [[first Transcontinental Railroad]] from [[Sacramento, California]] to [[Omaha, Nebraska]] was completed on 9 May 1869. The [[Central Pacific Railroad]], the Pacific end of the railroad, largely took over nearly all freight across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]] mountains in Northern California.

Each of these railroads controlled one (and Southern Pacific controlled two) of the transcontinental railroads which linked California with states farther East. The railroads moved freight and passengers in large quantities and allowed the state's economy and population to expand rapidly during the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nBy the 1890s the construction of electric railroads had begun in California and by the early 20th century several systems existed to serve California's largest cities. The state's electric railroad systems included the [[San Diego Electric Railway]], Los Angeles' [[Pacific Electric]] system, the [[Los Angeles Pacific Railroad]], [[East Bay Electric Lines]] and the [[Key System|San Francisco, Oakland, and San Jose Railway]] and [[Interurban]] rail systems such as the [[Sacramento Northern Railway]] were also constructed. By the 1920s, Los Angeles' [[Pacific Electric]] system was the largest electric railroad in the world.\n\n[[File:Amtrak Capitol Corridor.jpg|thumb|An Amtrak Capitol Corridor train passing through [[Santa Clara Station (California)|Santa Clara Station]] in 2005.]]\n\nThe expansion of American railroads peaked in the 1910s and during [[the Great Depression]] many railroads suffered financial difficulties which led to some railroad bankruptcies. [[World War II]] caused a surge in the use of California's railroads but with the government funded construction of the [[Interstate Highway System]] in the 1950s and the expansion of the [[Airline#U.S. airline industry|U.S. airline industry]] passenger rail service declined dramatically.\n\nThe 1970s saw the end of private passenger railroads in California, the creation of a national passenger railroad ([[Amtrak]]) and the [[Bay Area]]'s opening of the [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] rail-system. In the 1980s and 1990s commuter railroads where established in the Bay Area ([[Caltrain]] and [[Altamont Corridor Express]]), Los Angeles ([[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]]) and San Diego ([[Coaster (commuter rail)|Coaster]]) and [[light rail]] networks were built or expanded in most urban areas.\n\nThe early 2000s saw the expansion in usage of passenger rail service and in 2008 [[California Proposition 1A (2008)|voters approved]] plans for the construction of a [[California High-Speed Rail|high-speed rail network]].\n\n==History of California, 1900 to present==\n{{Main|History of California 1900 to present}}\nAfter 1900, California continued to grow rapidly and soon became an agricultural and industrial power. The economy was widely based on specialty agriculture, oil, tourism, shipping, film, and after 1940 advanced technology such as aerospace and electronics industries \u2013 along with a significant military presence. The films and stars of [[cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] helped make the state the \"center\" of worldwide attention. California became an American cultural phenomenon; the idea of the \"California Dream\" as a portion of the larger [[American Dream]] of finding a better life drew 35 million new residents from the start to the end of the 20th century (1900\u20132010).<ref>{{cite book| author=Walter Nugent| title=Into the West: The Story of Its People| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0AvI-biS6EsC&pg=PA5| year=2001| publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.| page=5| isbn=9780307426420}}</ref> [[Silicon Valley]] became the world's center for computer innovation.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|History|North America|United States|California}}\n* [[Outline of California history]]\n* [[Territorial evolution of California]]\n* [[History of California before 1900]]\n* [[History of California 1900 to present]]\n* {{C|History museums in California}}\n* [[California Dream]]\n\n; History of locations in California\n* [[History of Chico, California]]\n* [[History of Los Angeles, California]]\n* [[History of Piedmont, California]]\n* [[History of Riverside, California]]\n* [[History of Sacramento, California]]\n* [[History of San Bernardino, California]]\n* [[History of San Diego, California]]\n* [[History of San Francisco, California]]\n* [[History of San Jose, California]]\n* [[History of Santa Ana, California]]\n* [[History of Santa Barbara, California]]\n* [[History of Santa Monica, California]]\n* [[History of the San Fernando Valley to 1915]]\n* [[Timeline of the San Francisco Bay Area]]\n{{clear}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* Aron, Stephen. \"Convergence, California and the Newest Western History\", ''California History'' Volume: 86#4 September 2009. pp 4+ historiography.\n* Bakken, Gordon Morris.

So Friction proposed the idea to four people (Promzy, Lazzy, Prodigal, Bone-later left the group) and before they knew it, the five of them were performing at ghetto parties, clubs, street festivals etc.\n\nFriction's dog, Chicago, was also an official member of the group. You could hear the dog growling at the end of their tracks from the late 1990s. Eventually Chicago died.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://friction-music.com/pages/191153/Biography.html |title=BIOGRAPHY OF FRICTION |website=friction-music.com |access-date=2017-11-09}}</ref>\n\n==Albums==\n\nIn 1997, VIP presented at a street carnival. It was then that a Ghanaian television-presenter, Blakofe (aka Akua Manfo) and a radio-presenter called Michael Smith discovered the group. Blakofe became their manager, and Michael Smith gave them a contract by the name, Precise Music. In 1998, they released their first album, ''Bibi Baa O'', they were famous all over Accra. They became the most popular Hiplife group in Ghana. In 2000, they released their second album, ''Ye De Aba'', which was more successful than their first album. After the second album, Friction felt that it was his time to work as an individual artist and quit the group. The group now had three members (Promzy, Prodigal and Lazzy) and released a third album in 2001 called ''Lumbe Lumbe Lumbe'' with the smashing hit \"Daben na Odo Beba\". However the hip life group conquered the Ghana music charts with their 2003 album ''Ahomka Womu''; their single also named \"Ahomka Womu\" was number one on the Ghanaian charts for over 20 weeks. VIP won five awards at the Ghana Music Awards from the hit single and the group gained international exposure after this success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeriafilms.com/news/11304/37/exclusiveghana-music-awards-2011-full-list-of-winn.html |title=EXCLUSIVE:Ghana Music Awards 2011 full list of winnersVIP Wins Artiste Of The Year |publisher=Nigeriafilms.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}</ref> Since then, the group has been touring worldwide.

It was then that a Ghanaian television-presenter, Blakofe (aka Akua Manfo) and a radio-presenter called Michael Smith discovered the group. Blakofe became their manager, and Michael Smith gave them a contract by the name, Precise Music. In 1998, they released their first album, ''Bibi Baa O'', they were famous all over Accra. They became the most popular Hiplife group in Ghana. In 2000, they released their second album, ''Ye De Aba'', which was more successful than their first album. After the second album, Friction felt that it was his time to work as an individual artist and quit the group. The group now had three members (Promzy, Prodigal and Lazzy) and released a third album in 2001 called ''Lumbe Lumbe Lumbe'' with the smashing hit \"Daben na Odo Beba\". However the hip life group conquered the Ghana music charts with their 2003 album ''Ahomka Womu''; their single also named \"Ahomka Womu\" was number one on the Ghanaian charts for over 20 weeks. VIP won five awards at the Ghana Music Awards from the hit single and the group gained international exposure after this success.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeriafilms.com/news/11304/37/exclusiveghana-music-awards-2011-full-list-of-winn.html |title=EXCLUSIVE:Ghana Music Awards 2011 full list of winnersVIP Wins Artiste Of The Year |publisher=Nigeriafilms.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-17}}</ref> Since then, the group has been touring worldwide.

By 780, the eastern parts of the [[Syr Darya]] were ruled by the [[Karluk Turks]] and to their west were the Oghuz. Transoxiana, their main homeland in subsequent centuries became known as the \"Oghuz Steppe\".\n\nMass migrations of the Oghuz into [[Western Eurasia]] occurred from the early part of the 9th&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD onwards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For example, during the period of the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] (813\u2013833), the name Oghuz starts to appear in the works of Islamic writers. The ''[[Book of Dede Korkut]]'', a historical epic of the Oghuz, contains historical echoes of the 9th and 10th&nbsp;centuries but was likely written several centuries later.<ref>Alstadt, Audrey.

In general they were a herding society which possessed certain military advantages that sedentary societies did not have, particularly mobility. Alliances by marriage and kinship, and systems of \"social distance\" based on family relationships were the connective tissues of their society.\n\nIn Oghuz traditions, \"society was simply the result of the growth of individual families\". But such a society also grew by alliances and the expansion of different groups, normally through marriages. The shelter of the Oghuz tribes was a tent-like dwelling, erected on wooden poles and covered with skin, felt, or hand-woven textiles, which is called a ''[[yurt]]''.\n\nTheir cuisine included yahni (stew), kebabs, [[Toyga soup]] (meaning \"wedding soup\"), [[K\u0131m\u0131z]] (a traditional drink of the Turks, made from fermented horse milk), [[Pekmez]] (a syrup made of boiled grape juice) and helva made with wheat starch or rice flour, tutmac (noodle soup), yufka (flattened bread), katmer (layered pastry), chorek (ring-shaped buns), bread, clotted cream, cheese, milk and ayran (diluted yogurt beverage), as well as wine.\n\nSocial order was maintained by emphasizing \"correctness in conduct as well as ritual and ceremony\". Ceremonies brought together the scattered members of the society to celebrate birth, puberty, marriage, and death. Such ceremonies had the effect of minimizing social dangers and also of adjusting persons to each other under controlled emotional conditions.\n\n[[Patrilineal]]ly related men and their families were regarded as a group with rights over a particular territory and were distinguished from neighbours on a territorial basis. Marriages were often arranged among territorial groups so that neighbouring groups could become related, but this was the only organizing principle that extended territorial unity. Each community of the Oghuz Turks was thought of as part of a larger society composed of distant as well as close relatives. This signified \"tribal allegiance\". Wealth and materialistic objects were not commonly emphasized in Oghuz society and most remained herders, and when settled they would be active in agriculture.\n\nStatus within the family was based on age, gender, relationships by blood, or marriageability. Males as well as females were active in society, yet men were the backbones of leadership and organization. According to the ''Book of Dede Korkut'', which demonstrates the culture of the Oghuz Turks, women were \"expert horse riders, archers, and athletes\". The elders were respected as repositories of both \"secular and spiritual wisdom\".\n\n==Homeland in Transoxiana==\n[[File:Central Asia Physical.jpg|thumb|[[Map|Physical map]] of Central Asia from the Caucasus in the northwest, to Mongolia in the northeast.]]\n\nIn the 700s, the Oghuz Turks made a new home and domain for themselves in the area between the Caspian and Aral seas, a region that is often referred to as [[Transoxiana]], the western portion of Turkestan. They had moved westward from the Altay mountains passing through the [[Siberian]] steppes and settled in this region, and also penetrated into southern [[Russia]] and the [[Volga]] from their bases in west China. In the 11th century, the Oghuz Turks adopted [[Arabic]] script, replacing the [[Old Turkic alphabet]].<ref>C. E. Bosworth, ''The Ghaznavids:994\u20131040'', (Edinburgh University Press, 1963), 216.</ref>\n\nIn his accredited work titled ''Diwan Lughat al-Turk'', [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Mahmud of Kashgar]], a Turkic scholar of the 11th century, described the [[Tian Shan|Karachuk Mountains]] which are located just east of the Aral Sea as the original homeland of the Oghuz Turks. The Karachuk mountains are now known as the Tengri Tagh ([[Tian Shan]] in Chinese) Mountains, and they are adjacent to Syr Darya.\n\nThe extension from the Karachuk Mountains towards the Caspian Sea (Transoxiana) was called the \"Oghuz Steppe Lands\" from where the Oghuz Turks established trading, religious and cultural contacts with the Abbasid Arab caliphate who ruled to the south. This is around the same time that they first converted to Islam and renounced their [[Tengriism]] belief system. The Arab historians mentioned that the Oghuz Turks in their domain in Transoxiana were ruled by a number of kings and chieftains.\n\nIt was in this area that they later founded the Seljuk Empire, and it was from this area that they spread west into western Asia and eastern Europe during Turkic migrations from the 9th until the 12th century. The founders of the [[Ottoman Empire]] were also Oghuz Turks.\n\n==Poetry and Literature==\n{{expand section|date=March 2020}}\n{{see also|Oghuz languages#Literary works|Dadalo\u011flu|Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee|Pir Sultan Abdal|Imadaddin Nasimi|Magtymguly Pyragy}}\nOghuz Turkish literature includes the famous ''[[Book of Dede Korkut]]'' which was [[UNESCO]]'s 2000 literary work of the year, as well as the ''[[Oghuz Khagan#Legend|Oghuzname]]'', [[Battal Gazi|Battalname]], [[Danishmend Gazi#Legend|Danishmendname]], ''[[Epic of K\u00f6ro\u011flu|K\u00f6ro\u011flu]]'' epics which are part of the literary history of Azerbaijanis, Turks of Turkey and Turkmens. The modern and classical literature of [[Azerbaijani literature|Azerbaijan]], [[Turkish literature|Turkey]] and Central Asia are also considered Oghuz literature, since it was produced by their descendants.\n\nThe [[Book of Dede Korkut]] is an invaluable collection of epics and stories, bearing witness to the language, the way of life, religions, traditions and social norms of the Oghuz Turks in Azerbaijan, Turkey and Central Asia.\n\n== Oghuz and Y\u00f6r\u00fcks ==\n[[File:DAVIS(1879) p010 YOUROUK ENCAMPMENT IN THE TAURUS.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Y\u00f6r\u00fck]] camp in [[Taurus mountains]], 19th century]]\n[[File:AlaDaglarYoruk.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Y\u00f6r\u00fck shepherd in the [[Taurus Mountains]].]]\n{{main article|Y\u00f6r\u00fcks}}\n\nY\u00f6r\u00fcks are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ethnic group of Oghuz descent,<ref>N.

By 780, the eastern parts of the [[Syr Darya]] were ruled by the [[Karluk Turks]] and to their west were the Oghuz. Transoxiana, their main homeland in subsequent centuries became known as the \"Oghuz Steppe\".\n\nMass migrations of the Oghuz into [[Western Eurasia]] occurred from the early part of the 9th&nbsp;century&nbsp;AD onwards.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} For example, during the period of the [[Abbasid]] caliph [[Al-Ma'mun]] (813\u2013833), the name Oghuz starts to appear in the works of Islamic writers. The ''[[Book of Dede Korkut]]'', a historical epic of the Oghuz, contains historical echoes of the 9th and 10th&nbsp;centuries but was likely written several centuries later.<ref>Alstadt, Audrey.

In general they were a herding society which possessed certain military advantages that sedentary societies did not have, particularly mobility. Alliances by marriage and kinship, and systems of \"social distance\" based on family relationships were the connective tissues of their society.\n\nIn Oghuz traditions, \"society was simply the result of the growth of individual families\". But such a society also grew by alliances and the expansion of different groups, normally through marriages. The shelter of the Oghuz tribes was a tent-like dwelling, erected on wooden poles and covered with skin, felt, or hand-woven textiles, which is called a ''[[yurt]]''.\n\nTheir cuisine included yahni (stew), kebabs, [[Toyga soup]] (meaning \"wedding soup\"), [[K\u0131m\u0131z]] (a traditional drink of the Turks, made from fermented horse milk), [[Pekmez]] (a syrup made of boiled grape juice) and helva made with wheat starch or rice flour, tutmac (noodle soup), yufka (flattened bread), katmer (layered pastry), chorek (ring-shaped buns), bread, clotted cream, cheese, milk and ayran (diluted yogurt beverage), as well as wine.\n\nSocial order was maintained by emphasizing \"correctness in conduct as well as ritual and ceremony\". Ceremonies brought together the scattered members of the society to celebrate birth, puberty, marriage, and death. Such ceremonies had the effect of minimizing social dangers and also of adjusting persons to each other under controlled emotional conditions.\n\n[[Patrilineal]]ly related men and their families were regarded as a group with rights over a particular territory and were distinguished from neighbours on a territorial basis. Marriages were often arranged among territorial groups so that neighbouring groups could become related, but this was the only organizing principle that extended territorial unity. Each community of the Oghuz Turks was thought of as part of a larger society composed of distant as well as close relatives. This signified \"tribal allegiance\". Wealth and materialistic objects were not commonly emphasized in Oghuz society and most remained herders, and when settled they would be active in agriculture.\n\nStatus within the family was based on age, gender, relationships by blood, or marriageability. Males as well as females were active in society, yet men were the backbones of leadership and organization. According to the ''Book of Dede Korkut'', which demonstrates the culture of the Oghuz Turks, women were \"expert horse riders, archers, and athletes\". The elders were respected as repositories of both \"secular and spiritual wisdom\".\n\n==Homeland in Transoxiana==\n[[File:Central Asia Physical.jpg|thumb|[[Map|Physical map]] of Central Asia from the Caucasus in the northwest, to Mongolia in the northeast.]]\n\nIn the 700s, the Oghuz Turks made a new home and domain for themselves in the area between the Caspian and Aral seas, a region that is often referred to as [[Transoxiana]], the western portion of Turkestan. They had moved westward from the Altay mountains passing through the [[Siberian]] steppes and settled in this region, and also penetrated into southern [[Russia]] and the [[Volga]] from their bases in west China. In the 11th century, the Oghuz Turks adopted [[Arabic]] script, replacing the [[Old Turkic alphabet]].<ref>C. E. Bosworth, ''The Ghaznavids:994\u20131040'', (Edinburgh University Press, 1963), 216.</ref>\n\nIn his accredited work titled ''Diwan Lughat al-Turk'', [[Mahmud al-Kashgari|Mahmud of Kashgar]], a Turkic scholar of the 11th century, described the [[Tian Shan|Karachuk Mountains]] which are located just east of the Aral Sea as the original homeland of the Oghuz Turks. The Karachuk mountains are now known as the Tengri Tagh ([[Tian Shan]] in Chinese) Mountains, and they are adjacent to Syr Darya.\n\nThe extension from the Karachuk Mountains towards the Caspian Sea (Transoxiana) was called the \"Oghuz Steppe Lands\" from where the Oghuz Turks established trading, religious and cultural contacts with the Abbasid Arab caliphate who ruled to the south. This is around the same time that they first converted to Islam and renounced their [[Tengriism]] belief system. The Arab historians mentioned that the Oghuz Turks in their domain in Transoxiana were ruled by a number of kings and chieftains.\n\nIt was in this area that they later founded the Seljuk Empire, and it was from this area that they spread west into western Asia and eastern Europe during Turkic migrations from the 9th until the 12th century. The founders of the [[Ottoman Empire]] were also Oghuz Turks.\n\n==Poetry and Literature==\n{{expand section|date=March 2020}}\n{{see also|Oghuz languages#Literary works|Dadalo\u011flu|Fuz\u00fbl\u00ee|Pir Sultan Abdal|Imadaddin Nasimi|Magtymguly Pyragy}}\nOghuz Turkish literature includes the famous ''[[Book of Dede Korkut]]'' which was [[UNESCO]]'s 2000 literary work of the year, as well as the ''[[Oghuz Khagan#Legend|Oghuzname]]'', [[Battal Gazi|Battalname]], [[Danishmend Gazi#Legend|Danishmendname]], ''[[Epic of K\u00f6ro\u011flu|K\u00f6ro\u011flu]]'' epics which are part of the literary history of Azerbaijanis, Turks of Turkey and Turkmens. The modern and classical literature of [[Azerbaijani literature|Azerbaijan]], [[Turkish literature|Turkey]] and Central Asia are also considered Oghuz literature, since it was produced by their descendants.\n\nThe [[Book of Dede Korkut]] is an invaluable collection of epics and stories, bearing witness to the language, the way of life, religions, traditions and social norms of the Oghuz Turks in Azerbaijan, Turkey and Central Asia.\n\n== Oghuz and Y\u00f6r\u00fcks ==\n[[File:DAVIS(1879) p010 YOUROUK ENCAMPMENT IN THE TAURUS.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Y\u00f6r\u00fck]] camp in [[Taurus mountains]], 19th century]]\n[[File:AlaDaglarYoruk.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Y\u00f6r\u00fck shepherd in the [[Taurus Mountains]].]]\n{{main article|Y\u00f6r\u00fcks}}\n\nY\u00f6r\u00fcks are a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] ethnic group of Oghuz descent,<ref>N.

Founded in 1888 as the '''Football League''', the league is the oldest such competition in [[Association football around the world|world football]]. It was the top-level football league in England from its foundation until 1992, when the top 22 clubs split away to form the [[Premier League]].\n\nThe three leagues below the Premier League are known as the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], [[EFL League One|League One]] and [[EFL League Two|League Two]], normally with 24 clubs in each division (72 in total; in the 2019-2020 season, League One was reduced to 23 following the expulsion of [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]). Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest-placed clubs in the Premier League, and the bottom clubs of League Two to switch with the top clubs of the [[National League (division)|National League]], thus integrating the League into the [[English football league system]]. Although primarily a competition for English clubs, clubs from Wales&nbsp;\u2013 currently [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] &nbsp;\u2013 also take part, while in the past [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]], [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] and [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] have been members.\n\nThe Football League was associated with a title sponsor between 1983 and 2016. As this sponsor changed over the years the league too has been known by various names.<ref>After its title sponsors, the Football League has formerly been known as the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] League, the [[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]] League, the [[Barclays]] League, the [[Endsleigh Insurance|Endsleigh]] League, the [[Nationwide Building Society|Nationwide]] Football League, the [[Coca-Cola]] Football League and the [[RWE npower|npower]] The Football League</ref> Starting with the 2016\u201317 season, the league has moved away from having a title sponsor, rebranding itself as the English Football League (EFL), in much the same way the Premier League is known as the \"EPL\" internationally.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rebranded Football League changing its name to English Football League as EFL unveils new logo |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/11991553/Rebranded-Football-League-changing-its-name-to-English-Football-League-as-EFL-unveils-new-logo.html |accessdate=7 August 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe English Football League is also the name of the governing body of the league competition, and this body also organises two knock-out cup competitions, the [[EFL Cup]] and the [[EFL Trophy]].

It runs the oldest professional football league competition in the world. It also organises two knockout cup competitions, the [[EFL Cup]] and [[EFL Trophy]]. The Football League was founded in 1888 by then-[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] director [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], originally with 12 member clubs. Steady growth and the addition of more divisions meant that by 1950 the League had 92 clubs. Financial considerations led to a major shake-up in 1992, when in a step to maximise their revenue the leading members of the Football League broke away to form their own competition, the FA Premier League, which was renamed the [[Premier League]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/22/65/0,,12306~91426,00.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304205428/http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/22/65/0%2C%2C12306~91426%2C00.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2009 |title=Premier League and Barclays Announce Competition Name Change |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 November 2006 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Football League therefore no longer includes the top 20 clubs who belong to this group, although [[promotion and relegation]] between the Football League and the Premier League continues.

Each division has 24 clubs, and in any given season a club plays each of the others in the same division twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents. This makes for a total of 46 games played each season.\n\nClubs gain three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat. At the end of the season, clubs at the top of their division may win promotion to the next higher division, while those at the bottom may be relegated to the next lower one. At the top end of the competition, three Championship clubs win promotion from the Football League to the Premier League, with the bottom three Premier League clubs taking their places. At the lower end, two League Two clubs lose their Football League status with relegation to the [[National League (division)|National]] division of the [[National League (English football)|National League]], while two teams from that division join League Two of The Football League in their stead.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Division\n! Promoted directly\n! Promoted via [[Football League play-offs|playoffs]]\n! Relegated\n|-\n| The Championship\n| Top 2 clubs\n| One from 3rd to 6th-place finishers\n| Bottom 3 clubs\n|-\n| League One\n| Top 2 clubs\n| One from 3rd to 6th-place finishers\n| Bottom 4 clubs\n|-\n| League Two\n| Top 3 clubs\n| One from 4th to 7th-place finishers\n| Bottom 2 clubs\n|}\n\nPromotion and relegation are determined by final league positions, but to sustain interest for more clubs over the length of the season one promotion place from each division is decided according to a playoff between four clubs, which takes place at the end of the season. It is therefore possible for a team finishing sixth in the Championship or League One, or seventh in League Two, to be promoted rather than the clubs finishing immediately above them in the standings.\n\nSince the 2004\u201305 season, penalties have existed for clubs entering financial administration during the season. If a club enters administration before 31 March of any given season, they will immediately be deducted 12 points; entering administration from 1 April onward will see the points deduction either held over until the end of the season (if the club finishes outside the relegation places), or applied the following season (if the club was relegated anyway). It is also required that a club exiting administration agree a Creditor's Voluntary Agreement, and pay in full any other footballing creditors. Failure to do either of these will result in a second, potentially unlimited (though in practise usually between 15 and 20) points deduction.\n\nThe other main situation in which is a club may lose points is by fielding an improperly registered or otherwise ineligible player. If a club is found to have done this, then any points earned from any match that player participated in will be deducted; the opposing club(s) do not earn any points from this, however.\n\n===Cup===\nThe EFL organises two knock-out cup competitions: the [[EFL Cup]] (officially called the Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons) and the [[EFL Trophy]] (officially called the leasing.com Trophy also for sponsorship reasons). The EFL Cup was established in 1960 and is open to all EFL and Premier League clubs, with the winner eligible to participate in the [[UEFA Europa League]]. The EFL Trophy, established in 1983, is for clubs belonging to EFL League One and EFL League Two. The organisation celebrated its 100th birthday in 1988 with a [[Football League Centenary Tournament|Centenary Tournament]] at Wembley between 16 of its member clubs.\n\n==History==\n[[File:mcgregor.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], founder of The Football League]]\nAfter four years of debate, [[the Football Association]] finally permitted professionalism on 20 July 1885.

Preston won the first league title without losing a game, and completed the first league\u2013cup [[Double (association football)|double]] by also taking the [[FA Cup]].\n\nIn 1890 Stoke were not re-elected to the league, and were replaced for the 1890\u201391 season by [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], who won it in their second, third and fifth year. Stoke were re-elected for the 1891\u201392 season, along with [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]], to take the league to 14 clubs.\n\nPreston North End, Aston Villa and Sunderland dominated the early years of the game; in the first fourteen seasons the only other clubs to win (single) league titles were Everton, Sheffield United and Liverpool.\n\n===Addition of the Second Division===\n[[File:AstonVilla1896-97.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The [[Aston Villa]] team in 1897, after winning both the [[FA Cup]] and the Football League.]]\nA new Second Division was formed in 1892 with the absorption of the rival [[Football Alliance]]. Alliance clubs [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]] (later Sheffield Wednesday) and [[Manchester United F.C.|Newton Heath]] (later Manchester United) were added to the new First Division, and Darwen were reallocated to the new Second, bringing the First Division total to 16 clubs.

The bottom clubs of the lower division were subsequently required to apply for re-election to the League at the end of each season.\n\nAccrington F.C. were relegated from Division 1, however chose to resign from the Football League rather than play in the 2nd division. [[Bootle F.C. (1879)|Bootle]] were dissolved because of financial problems. The Second Division increased to 15 clubs for season 1893\u201394. Instead of three clubs expanding the division, five were added to make the number to fifteen. The additional clubs were [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] from the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]], [[Middlesbrough Ironopolis F.C.|Middlesbrough Ironopolis]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] from the Northern League, [[Rotherham Town F.C.

From 1900, Aston Villa (1899\u20131900, 1909\u201310), Liverpool (1900\u201301, 1905\u201306), Sunderland (1901\u201302, 1912\u201313), The Wednesday (1902\u201303, 1903\u201304), Newcastle United (1904\u201305, 1908\u201309), Manchester United (1907\u201308, 1910\u201311) and Blackburn Rovers (1911\u201312, 1913\u201314) all won two titles prior to the outbreak of the [[First World War]], while Everton added a second title to their much earlier success in the last season, 1914\u201315.\n\nIt was not until the early years of the 20th century, and the expansion of both Leagues to 20 clubs (in 1905), that further southern clubs such as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] (1905), [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (1907) and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (1908) established themselves in the League. There would be a further wait until 1931 before a southern club, Arsenal, would win the League for the first time.\n\nUnlike in most other Leagues in Europe, no single English club managed to remain an ever-present in the division during the one hundred and four years of its existence as the top division in the country. Everton come closest, missing just four seasons through relegation, and remain one of only three clubs in England to have played over 100 top-flight seasons, along with Aston Villa and Arsenal.\n\n===Post-First World War===\nThe League was suspended for four seasons during the [[World War I|First World War]] and resumed in 1919 with the First and Second Divisions expanded to 22 clubs. On resumption [[West Bromwich Albion]] (1919\u201320) and [[Burnley]] (1920\u201321), both original 12 clubs, won their first-ever titles (in [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|Albion's]] case their only title to date).\n\nIn 1920, leading clubs from the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] joined the League to form a new Third Division, which in 1921 was renamed the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] upon the further addition of more clubs in a new [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]]. One club from each of these divisions would gain promotion to the Second Division, with the two relegated clubs being assigned to the more appropriate Third Division. To accommodate potential difficulties in this arrangement, clubs in the Midlands such as [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] or Walsall would sometimes be moved from one Third Division to the other.\n\nFollowing this burst of post-war growth, the League entered a prolonged period of relative stability with few changes in the membership, although there were changes on the pitch. In 1925, a new [[Offside (association football)|offside]] law reduced the number of defending opponents between the attacking player and the goal from three to two, leading to a large increase in goals, and numbers on shirts were introduced in 1939.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1926, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] were the first team to win three consecutive league titles (and never won another one, though they finished as runners-up for the following two years). This was equalled by [[Arsenal]] between 1932 and 1935, during a period from 1930 to 1938 in which they won five titles out of eight.\n\n[[Manchester City]] (1936\u201337) became the only other club to be added to the list of Football League winners prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the fourteenth club to achieve the feat since 1888\u201389.\n\nIn the [[1938\u201339 Football League|1938-39]] season [[Everton F.C|Everton]] won the title for the fifth time, but suffered the same fate as in [[1914\u201315 Football League|1915]], being champions when football was suspended due to the World War.\n\n===Post-Second World War===\nThe League was suspended once more in 1939 with the outbreak of the Second World War, this time for seven seasons. The Third Divisions were expanded to 24 clubs each in 1950, bringing the total number of League clubs to 92, and in 1958 the decision was made to end the regionalisation of the Third Divisions and reorganise the clubs into a new nationwide Third Division and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. To accomplish this, the clubs in the top half of both the Third Division North and South joined together to form the new Third Division, and those in the bottom half made up the Fourth Division. An earlier suggestion that the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] should become the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] become the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] on the basis of better attendances and that they tended to fare better when promoted was rejected.<ref name=\"D3 / D4 \u2013 original suggestion\">{{Cite book | last = Bowser | first = Paul | title = Bootham Crescent: A Second Home \u2013 Part  1 | year = 2019 | publisher =Minsterman Books | isbn = 978-1-9996907-0-0 | page = 219}}</ref> Four clubs were promoted and relegated between these two lower divisions, while two clubs exchanged places in the upper divisions until 1974, when the number increased to three.\n\nClubs to win their first League titles in the quarter-century following the Second World War were [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350), [[Tottenham Hotspur]] (1950\u201351 and 1960\u201361), founder members of the League Wolverhampton Wanderers (1953\u201354, 1957\u201358 and 1958\u201359), [[Chelsea F.C|Chelsea]] (1954\u201355), [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] (1961\u201362) and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] (1968\u201369).\n\n[[Tottenham Hotspur]] became the first club in the 20th century to win the League and [[F.A. Cup]] 'Double' in 1960\u201361, a season after [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] had come within a whisker of achieving the feat themselves ([[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] won the 1959\u201360 [[F.A. Cup]] and were runners-up to [[Burnley]] in the League by a single point).\n\nPost-Second World War changes in league football included the use of white balls in 1951 and the first [[Floodlight#Association football|floodlit game]] (played between Portsmouth and [[Newcastle United]]) in 1956, opening up the possibility of midweek evening matches.\n\nBy far the biggest change for league clubs during this era was a new cup competition open to all the members of the League, the [[Football League Cup]], which was held for the first time in 1960\u201361 to provide clubs with a new source of income. Aston Villa won the inaugural League Cup and, despite an initial lack of enthusiasm on the part of some other big clubs, the competition became firmly established in the footballing calendar, although it was not until the dawn of the 1970s that all 92 Football League clubs regularly participated in the competition season after season.\n\nSubstitutes (1 per team per match) were first allowed for injured players in 1965, and for any reason the next year.\n\n===1970s===\n\nThe first ever Sunday EFL game was held on 20 January 1974 (11:30 kick off) and was played between 2nd Division rivals Millwall and Fulham at The Den. Millwall won 1-0. The first ever Sunday top flight game was between Chelsea and Stoke a week later.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/23/first-sunday-football-1974-millwall-fulham | title=20 January 1974: The first Sunday football | date=23 January 2010 | newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=29 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBeginning with the 1976\u201377 season, the clubs finishing level on points began to be separated according to goal difference (the difference between goals scored and goals conceded) rather than goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded). This was an effort to prevent unduly defensive play encouraged by the greater advantage in limiting goals allowed. In the event that clubs had equal points and equal goal differences, priority was given to the club that had scored the most goals. There has been only one season, 1988\u201389, when this level of differentiation was necessary to determine the League champion, and this was the occasion of one of the most dramatic nights in League history, when Arsenal beat Liverpool 2\u20130 at [[Anfield]] in [[Liverpool F.C. 0\u20132 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|the last game of the season]] to win the League on this tiebreaker \u2013 by a single [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] goal in the final minute of the final game of the season. Both teams would finish with the same amount of goal difference, but Arsenal scored more goals during the season.\n\nTwo clubs won their first League titles during the 1970s: founder members of the League Derby County (1971\u201372 and 1974\u201375) and Nottingham Forest (1977\u201378), both clubs managed by [[Brian Clough]] and [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]]. Nottingham Forest's title in 1977\u201378 turned out to be the last occasion that a first-time champion won the First Division title during The Football League era, before the First Division clubs formed the Premier League in 1992. The next first-time League champion club would be Leicester City in the [[2015\u201316 Premier League|2015\u201316]] season, the first such during the Premier League era.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Football League logo (1988\u20132004).svg|frame|The logo of The Football League from 1988 until 2004]] -->\n\n===1980s===\nAnother important change was made in 1981, when it was decided to award [[three points for a win]] instead of two, a further effort to increase attacking football. (This scoring rule was not added by [[FIFA]] to the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s until the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 cup]] after the perceived dominance of defensive play at [[1990 FIFA World Cup|Italia 90]].)\n\nThe early 1980s also saw a significant decline in league attendances as a result of the [[Early 1980s recession|recession]] and the ongoing problem of [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]]. This did no favours for the financial position and league standing of numerous clubs, and several \u2013 including Wolverhampton Wanderers, [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] \u2013 were almost forced out of business as a result. The fortunes of the First Division clubs suffered a fresh blow in 1985 when all English clubs were banned from European competitions as a result of the [[Heysel disaster]], where rioting involving Liverpool fans at the [[1985 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] in Belgium resulted in 39 spectator deaths.\n\nIn a similar vein, playoffs to determine promotion places were introduced for the 1986\u201387 season so that more clubs remained eligible for promotion closer to the end of the season, and at the same time to aid in the reduction over two years of the number of clubs in the First Division from 22 to 20. For the first two seasons, the playoffs were contested between the lowest placed team to avoid automatic relegation and three highest placed teams to miss out on automatic promotion in the division below, before it was altered from the 1988\u201389 season to include just the four clubs who had missed out on automatic promotion in the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions. 1986\u201387 was the first season of the decade where Football League attendances increased, helped by improved economic conditions and falling unemployment nationally.\n\nAt the same time, automatic promotion and relegation between the Fourth Division and the [[Football Conference]] was introduced for one club, replacing the annual application for re-election to the League of the bottom four clubs and linking the League to the developing [[National League System]] pyramid.\n\nEmblematic of the confusion that was beginning to envelop the game, the number of clubs at the top of the league would return to 22 for the 1991\u201392 season, which increased competitiveness in the 1990\u201391 season as four teams would be promoted from the Second and Third Divisions instead of the normal three (with seventh place being the minimum position for the playoffs), while in the Fourth Division an unprecedented five promotion places were up for grabs, with eighth place being high enough for the playoffs. The end of the ban on English clubs in Europe also helped boost interest in English football. However, the economy was now in another [[Early 1990s recession|recession]], and added to that the clubs in the top two English divisions were faced with the requirement of having all-seater stadiums by 1994\u201395 to comply with the [[Taylor Report]] that followed the death of 96 Liverpool fans as a result of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in April 1989.\n\nThe League also expanded to 93 clubs for the 1991\u201392 season and planned to raise the number again to 94 clubs for 1992\u201393, but after [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] and [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]] both went out of business within a few months of each other in mid-1992, this plan was abandoned. The issues creating the uncertainty in the game all centred on money.\n\nThe increasing influence of money in English football was evident with such events as the first \u00a31m transfer in the game, that of [[Trevor Francis]] from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] to Nottingham Forest in February 1979. The first \u00a32million player transferred between English clubs was [[Tony Cottee]], who moved from West Ham United to Everton in July 1988 \u2013 although several players had already been sold by English clubs to foreign clubs for even higher fees.\n\nBefore the formation of the FA Premier League, the highest transfer fee paid was \u00a32.9million for the transfer of [[Dean Saunders]] from Derby County to Liverpool during the 1991 close season. The first \u00a33million player was [[Alan Shearer]], who moved from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] to Blackburn Rovers in July 1992, the summer before the first Premier League season. At the close of the 1991 season, a proposal for the establishment of a new league was tabled that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |title=In the matter of an agreement between the Football Association Premier League Limited and the Football Association Limited and the Football League Limited and their respective member clubs |publisher=HM Courts Service |year=2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222536/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref> The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship agreements.

There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained on the same terms as between the old First and Second Divisions.\n\nThe 1991\u201392 season had ended with 92 clubs in the Football League, with the 93rd club, Aldershot, having been declared bankrupt and forced to resign from the Fourth Division a few weeks before the end of the season. [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], the GM Vauxhall Conference champions, were promoted to the new Division Three as the 71st members of the reorganised Football League. However, this number would soon drop to 70 due to the closure of Maidstone United at the beginning of the 1992\u201393 season, and the Football League abandoned its expansion plan. This meant that there would once again be 92 clubs in the highest four divisions of English football.\n\n===1992\u20132004: Three divisions===\nThere were few major changes to the structure Football League in the 12 seasons which followed the breakaway that created the FA Premier League, perhaps the only notable changes being an expansion to 72 clubs from 70 for the 1995\u201396 season after the Premier League was streamlined to 20 clubs from 22, and the introduction of a second relegation place to the Football Conference from the end of the 2002\u201303 season.\n\nHowever, following the formation of the Premier League, it became increasingly difficult for newly promoted clubs to establish themselves in the top flight. Whereas newly promoted teams had once normally survived for at least a few seasons in the old First Division, it was now the norm for at least one newly promoted club to be relegated straight back from the Premier League to Division One. In the nine seasons that followed the formation of the Premier League, at least one newly promoted club suffered this fate \u2013 and in the 1997\u201398 season it happened to all three newly promoted teams. There were exceptions, however; including Blackburn Rovers, who were promoted to the Premier League on its formation and were champions three years later, and Newcastle United, who were promoted in 1993 and finished in the top six for the next four seasons, finishing Premier League runners-up twice.\n\nThe trend of relegated clubs to win an instant promotion back to the top flight continued, however. In the 12 seasons following the formation of the Premier League, there were just three seasons where none of the newly relegated sides failed to win an instant return to the Premier League.\n\nThe widening gulf between the top two divisions of English football can largely be put down to the increased wealth of the Premier League clubs, and the wealth gained by these clubs \u2013 combined with parachute payments following relegation \u2013 has also made it easier for many of them to quickly win promotion back to the top flight.\n\nIn spite of the economic prosperity between 1992 and 2004, many Football League clubs did run into financial problems during this time, although none of them were forced out of business. These include [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and Leicester City. Some of these clubs were faced with financial problems as a result of the lost revenue resulting from Premier League relegation and a failure to return to this level, as well as the collapse of [[ITV Digital]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1896732.stm |title=ITV Digital goes broke |date=27 March 2002 |accessdate=10 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nJust after the end of the 2001\u201302 season, [[South London]] based [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] were given permission to move to [[Milton Keynes]], some 70 miles from their traditional home.

The club's move to Milton Keynes was completed in September 2003, when they became tenants of the [[National Hockey Stadium (Milton Keynes)|National Hockey Stadium]] until a new permanent home was completed four years later, and the club's name changed to [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in June 2004.\n[[File:The Football League.png|thumb|right|100px|Football League logo, 2004-2016]]\n\n===2004 Football League rebranding===\n[[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] was the first season to feature the rebranded Football League.

The old Second Division became the new First Division, the Third Division became the Second Division, and the Fourth Division became the Third Division. The financial health of its clubs had become perhaps the highest League priority due to the limited resources available. However, there were some promising signs for the future, as the League planned to announce new initiatives beginning with the 2004\u201305 season, coinciding with the start of a new sponsorship agreement with Coca-Cola. The first of these changes was a rebranding of the League with the renaming of the First Division as The Championship, the Second Division as League One and the Third Division as League Two. The League's cup competitions have had different sponsors. The current sponsor Sky Bet commissioned a suite of trophies for the league from silversmith [[Thomas Lyte]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.footballbusinessawards.com/2014_shortlist_summaries.html|title=Football Business Awards 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118064251/http://www.footballbusinessawards.com/2014_shortlist_summaries.html|archivedate=18 November 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Media rights==\n=== United Kingdom and Ireland ===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right\"\n|+ Matches broadcast in the United Kingdom and Ireland\n|- style=\"font-size:85%\"\n!Seasons\n!Sky\n!BBC\n!{{tooltip|Total|Total number of games broadcast}}\n|- style=\"font-size:75%\"\n|?\u20132009||?||?||?\n|- style=\"font-size:75%\"\n|2009\u20132012||65||10||75\n|- style=\"font-size:75%\"\n|2012\u20132015||75||\u2013||75\n|- style=\"font-size:75%\"\n|2015\u20132018||112||\u2013||112\n|- style=\"font-size:75%\"\n|2019\u20132024||138||\u2013||138\n|}\nThe other major source of revenue is television. The 1980s saw competition between terrestrial broadcasters for the rights to show League matches, but the arrival on the scene of satellite broadcaster [[Sky (United Kingdom)|British Sky Broadcasting]] (Sky TV), eagerly searching for attractive programming to build its customer base and willing to pay huge sums, changed the picture entirely. The League's top tier clubs had been agitating for several years to be able to keep more of the League's revenue for themselves, threatening to break away and form their own league if necessary. In 1992 the threat was realised as the First Division clubs left to establish the FA Premier League and signed a contract for exclusive live coverage of their games with Sky TV. The FA Premier League agreed to maintain the promotion and relegation of three clubs with The Football League, but The League was now in a far weaker position \u2013 without its best clubs and without the clout to negotiate high-revenue TV deals. This problem was exacerbated with the collapse in 2002 of ITV Digital, holder of TV rights for The Football League, which cost League clubs millions of pounds in revenue.\n\nIn 2001 the league signed a \u00a3315&nbsp;million deal with [[ITV Digital]], but in March 2002 the broadcaster was put into administration by its [[Carlton Communications|parent]] [[Granada plc|companies]] when the league refused to accept a \u00a3130&nbsp;million reduction in the deal. As a result, the Football League cuts off the deal and ITV Digital suffered the losses. In November 2007 the league announced a new domestic rights deal worth \u00a3264&nbsp;million with Sky and the BBC for the three seasons from 2009 to 2012. It covers Football League, League Cup and Football League Trophy matches and the full range of media: terrestrial and pay television, broadband internet, video-on-demand and mobile services. The deal represents a 135% increase on the previous deal and works out at an average of over \u00a31.2 million per club per season, though some clubs will receive more than others. Sky will provide the majority of the coverage and the BBC broadcast 10 exclusively live matches from the Championship per season and the semi-finals and finals of the League Cup.<ref>[http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10794~1160914,00.html Football League Agrees Historic Deal with Sky Sports and BBC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215071405/http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10794~1160914%2C00.html |date=15 December 2007 }}, ''www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk'', 6 November 2007.</ref>\nIn 2012, Sky Sports signed a new exclusive deal to broadcast all matches after the BBC pulled out of the deal owing the financial cuts that the BBC Sport department was going through.

(Leeds United v. Watford, [[Millennium Stadium]])]]\nThe Football League Play-offs are used as a means of determining the final promotion place from each of the league's three divisions. This is a way of keeping the possibility of promotion open for more clubs towards the end of the season.\n\nThe format was first introduced in 1987, after the decision was made to reduce the top flight from 22 to 20 clubs over the next two seasons; initially, the play-offs involved the team finishing immediately above the relegation places in a given division and the three teams who finished immediately below the promotion places in the division below \u2013 essentially one team was fighting to keep their place in the higher division while the other three teams were attempting to take it from them. In 1989, this was changed\u2014instead of teams from different divisions playing each other, the four teams below the automatic promotion places contested the play-offs. The first season of this arrangement saw the final being contested in home and away legs. The four teams play-off in two semi-finals and a final, with the team winning the final being promoted. Originally the semi-finals and the final were all two-legged home-and-away affairs, but from 1990 onwards the final is a one-off match. It is in this format that the play-offs continue today. A proposal to have six teams rather than four competing for the final place was defeated at the league's AGM in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2966968.stm |title=Play-off plans shelved |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 June 2003 |accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Play-off winners===\n{| class=wikitable \n|-\n!

('''EFL''') is a league competition featuring professional [[association football]] clubs from [[England]] and [[Wales]]. Founded in 1888 as the '''Football League''', the league is the oldest such competition in [[Association football around the world|world football]]. It was the top-level football league in England from its foundation until 1992, when the top 22 clubs split away to form the [[Premier League]].\n\nThe three leagues below the Premier League are known as the [[EFL Championship|Championship]], [[EFL League One|League One]] and [[EFL League Two|League Two]], normally with 24 clubs in each division (72 in total; in the 2019-2020 season, League One was reduced to 23 following the expulsion of [[Bury F.C.|Bury]]). Promotion and relegation between these divisions is a central feature of the League and is further extended to allow the top Championship clubs to exchange places with the lowest-placed clubs in the Premier League, and the bottom clubs of League Two to switch with the top clubs of the [[National League (division)|National League]], thus integrating the League into the [[English football league system]]. Although primarily a competition for English clubs, clubs from Wales&nbsp;\u2013 currently [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Newport County A.F.C.|Newport County]] &nbsp;\u2013 also take part, while in the past [[Wrexham F.C.|Wrexham]], [[Merthyr Town F.C.|Merthyr Town]] and [[Aberdare Athletic F.C.|Aberdare Athletic]] have been members.\n\nThe Football League was associated with a title sponsor between 1983 and 2016. As this sponsor changed over the years the league too has been known by various names.<ref>After its title sponsors, the Football League has formerly been known as the [[Canon (company)|Canon]] League, the [[Today (UK newspaper)|Today]] League, the [[Barclays]] League, the [[Endsleigh Insurance|Endsleigh]] League, the [[Nationwide Building Society|Nationwide]] Football League, the [[Coca-Cola]] Football League and the [[RWE npower|npower]] The Football League</ref> Starting with the 2016\u201317 season, the league has moved away from having a title sponsor, rebranding itself as the English Football League (EFL), in much the same way the Premier League is known as the \"EPL\" internationally.<ref>{{cite news |title=Rebranded Football League changing its name to English Football League as EFL unveils new logo |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/championship/11991553/Rebranded-Football-League-changing-its-name-to-English-Football-League-as-EFL-unveils-new-logo.html |accessdate=7 August 2016 |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=12 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe English Football League is also the name of the governing body of the league competition, and this body also organises two knock-out cup competitions, the [[EFL Cup]] and the [[EFL Trophy]].

It runs the oldest professional football league competition in the world. It also organises two knockout cup competitions, the [[EFL Cup]] and [[EFL Trophy]]. The Football League was founded in 1888 by then-[[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] director [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], originally with 12 member clubs. Steady growth and the addition of more divisions meant that by 1950 the League had 92 clubs. Financial considerations led to a major shake-up in 1992, when in a step to maximise their revenue the leading members of the Football League broke away to form their own competition, the FA Premier League, which was renamed the [[Premier League]] in 2007.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/22/65/0,,12306~91426,00.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304205428/http://www.premierleague.com/staticFiles/22/65/0%2C%2C12306~91426%2C00.pdf |archivedate=4 March 2009 |title=Premier League and Barclays Announce Competition Name Change |publisher=Premier League |accessdate=22 November 2006 |format=PDF |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Football League therefore no longer includes the top 20 clubs who belong to this group, although [[promotion and relegation]] between the Football League and the Premier League continues.

Each division has 24 clubs, and in any given season a club plays each of the others in the same division twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents. This makes for a total of 46 games played each season.\n\nClubs gain three points for a win, one for a draw, and none for a defeat. At the end of the season, clubs at the top of their division may win promotion to the next higher division, while those at the bottom may be relegated to the next lower one. At the top end of the competition, three Championship clubs win promotion from the Football League to the Premier League, with the bottom three Premier League clubs taking their places. At the lower end, two League Two clubs lose their Football League status with relegation to the [[National League (division)|National]] division of the [[National League (English football)|National League]], while two teams from that division join League Two of The Football League in their stead.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Division\n! Promoted directly\n! Promoted via [[Football League play-offs|playoffs]]\n! Relegated\n|-\n| The Championship\n| Top 2 clubs\n| One from 3rd to 6th-place finishers\n| Bottom 3 clubs\n|-\n| League One\n| Top 2 clubs\n| One from 3rd to 6th-place finishers\n| Bottom 4 clubs\n|-\n| League Two\n| Top 3 clubs\n| One from 4th to 7th-place finishers\n| Bottom 2 clubs\n|}\n\nPromotion and relegation are determined by final league positions, but to sustain interest for more clubs over the length of the season one promotion place from each division is decided according to a playoff between four clubs, which takes place at the end of the season. It is therefore possible for a team finishing sixth in the Championship or League One, or seventh in League Two, to be promoted rather than the clubs finishing immediately above them in the standings.\n\nSince the 2004\u201305 season, penalties have existed for clubs entering financial administration during the season. If a club enters administration before 31 March of any given season, they will immediately be deducted 12 points; entering administration from 1 April onward will see the points deduction either held over until the end of the season (if the club finishes outside the relegation places), or applied the following season (if the club was relegated anyway). It is also required that a club exiting administration agree a Creditor's Voluntary Agreement, and pay in full any other footballing creditors. Failure to do either of these will result in a second, potentially unlimited (though in practise usually between 15 and 20) points deduction.\n\nThe other main situation in which is a club may lose points is by fielding an improperly registered or otherwise ineligible player. If a club is found to have done this, then any points earned from any match that player participated in will be deducted; the opposing club(s) do not earn any points from this, however.\n\n===Cup===\nThe EFL organises two knock-out cup competitions: the [[EFL Cup]] (officially called the Carabao Cup for sponsorship reasons) and the [[EFL Trophy]] (officially called the leasing.com Trophy also for sponsorship reasons). The EFL Cup was established in 1960 and is open to all EFL and Premier League clubs, with the winner eligible to participate in the [[UEFA Europa League]]. The EFL Trophy, established in 1983, is for clubs belonging to EFL League One and EFL League Two. The organisation celebrated its 100th birthday in 1988 with a [[Football League Centenary Tournament|Centenary Tournament]] at Wembley between 16 of its member clubs.\n\n==History==\n[[File:mcgregor.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|[[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]], founder of The Football League]]\nAfter four years of debate, [[the Football Association]] finally permitted professionalism on 20 July 1885.

This points system was not agreed upon until after the season had started; the alternative proposal was one point for a win only. Preston won the first league title without losing a game, and completed the first league\u2013cup [[Double (association football)|double]] by also taking the [[FA Cup]].\n\nIn 1890 Stoke were not re-elected to the league, and were replaced for the 1890\u201391 season by [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]], who won it in their second, third and fifth year. Stoke were re-elected for the 1891\u201392 season, along with [[Darwen F.C.|Darwen]], to take the league to 14 clubs.\n\nPreston North End, Aston Villa and Sunderland dominated the early years of the game; in the first fourteen seasons the only other clubs to win (single) league titles were Everton, Sheffield United and Liverpool.\n\n===Addition of the Second Division===\n[[File:AstonVilla1896-97.jpg|thumb|upright=1.05|The [[Aston Villa]] team in 1897, after winning both the [[FA Cup]] and the Football League.]]\nA new Second Division was formed in 1892 with the absorption of the rival [[Football Alliance]]. Alliance clubs [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|The Wednesday]] (later Sheffield Wednesday) and [[Manchester United F.C.|Newton Heath]] (later Manchester United) were added to the new First Division, and Darwen were reallocated to the new Second, bringing the First Division total to 16 clubs. With the addition of [[Northwich Victoria F.C.|Northwich Victoria]] (from [[The Combination]]), [[Port Vale F.C.|Burslem Port Vale]] (later Port Vale, from the [[Midland Football League (1889)|Midland League]]) and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] (from the [[Northern Football League|Northern League]]), the Second Division started with 12 clubs, as Alliance club [[Birmingham St George's F.C.|Birmingham St George's]] disbanded at that point. The bottom clubs of the lower division were subsequently required to apply for re-election to the League at the end of each season.\n\nAccrington F.C. were relegated from Division 1, however chose to resign from the Football League rather than play in the 2nd division. [[Bootle F.C. (1879)|Bootle]] were dissolved because of financial problems. The Second Division increased to 15 clubs for season 1893\u201394. Instead of three clubs expanding the division, five were added to make the number to fifteen. The additional clubs were [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] from the [[Lancashire League (football)|Lancashire League]], [[Middlesbrough Ironopolis F.C.|Middlesbrough Ironopolis]] and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] from the Northern League, [[Rotherham Town F.C. (1878)|Rotherham Town]] from the Midland League, and [[Arsenal F.C.|Woolwich Arsenal]] (later Arsenal), who became the first team from the [[Southern England|South of England]] to compete.\n\nFor the following season 1894\u201395, the third season of the division, there was a net increase to 16 with the addition of [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] from the Lancashire League, [[leicester City F.C.|Leicester Fosse]] (later Leicester City) and [[Burton Wanderers F.C.|Burton Wanderers]] (who later joined with existing Second Division club [[Burton Swifts F.C.|Burton Swifts]] to form [[Burton United F.C.|Burton United]]) from the Midland League along with [[Lincoln City FC]], while Northwich resigned and Middlesbrough Ironopolis disbanded.\n\nBoth Liverpool and Bury won the division at the first attempt.\n\nIn 1895 [[Loughborough F.C.|Loughborough]] replaced [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall Town Swifts]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/lghist/fl1895.htm|title=Football Club History Database \u2013 Football League 1894\u201395|work=fchd.info}}</ref> In 1896 [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]] from the Lancashire League and [[Gainsborough Trinity F.C.|Gainsborough Trinity]] from the Midland League replaced Burslem Port Vale and [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/lghist/fl1896.htm|title=Football Club History Database \u2013 Football League 1895\u201396|work=fchd.info}}</ref> In 1897 [[Luton Town]] from the United League replaced Burton Wanderers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/lghist/fl1897.htm|title=Football Club History Database \u2013 Football League 1896\u201397|work=fchd.info}}</ref>\n\nAutomatic promotion and relegation for two clubs was introduced in 1898 when the previous system of [[playoffs#Association football|test match]]es between the bottom two clubs of the First Division and the top two clubs of the Second Division was brought into disrepute when Stoke and Burnley colluded in the final match to ensure they were both in the First Division the next season. At this point both Divisions of the League expanded to eighteen, with the addition of [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] from the Midland and [[Yorkshire Football League|Yorkshire]] Leagues, Burslem Port Vale, [[Glossop North End A.F.C.|Glossop]] from the Midland League, and [[New Brighton Tower F.C.|New Brighton Tower]] from the Lancashire League to the Second Division.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fchd.info/lghist/fl1898.htm|title=Football Club History Database \u2013 Football League 1897\u201398|work=fchd.info}}</ref>\n\n===Early 20th century===\nAfter a few years other northern clubs began to catch up, with the likes of Newcastle United and Manchester United joining the League and having success. From 1900, Aston Villa (1899\u20131900, 1909\u201310), Liverpool (1900\u201301, 1905\u201306), Sunderland (1901\u201302, 1912\u201313), The Wednesday (1902\u201303, 1903\u201304), Newcastle United (1904\u201305, 1908\u201309), Manchester United (1907\u201308, 1910\u201311) and Blackburn Rovers (1911\u201312, 1913\u201314) all won two titles prior to the outbreak of the [[First World War]], while Everton added a second title to their much earlier success in the last season, 1914\u201315.\n\nIt was not until the early years of the 20th century, and the expansion of both Leagues to 20 clubs (in 1905), that further southern clubs such as [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Clapton Orient]] (1905), [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (1907) and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] (1908) established themselves in the League. There would be a further wait until 1931 before a southern club, Arsenal, would win the League for the first time.\n\nUnlike in most other Leagues in Europe, no single English club managed to remain an ever-present in the division during the one hundred and four years of its existence as the top division in the country. Everton come closest, missing just four seasons through relegation, and remain one of only three clubs in England to have played over 100 top-flight seasons, along with Aston Villa and Arsenal.\n\n===Post-First World War===\nThe League was suspended for four seasons during the [[World War I|First World War]] and resumed in 1919 with the First and Second Divisions expanded to 22 clubs. On resumption [[West Bromwich Albion]] (1919\u201320) and [[Burnley]] (1920\u201321), both original 12 clubs, won their first-ever titles (in [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|Albion's]] case their only title to date).\n\nIn 1920, leading clubs from the [[Southern Football League|Southern League]] joined the League to form a new Third Division, which in 1921 was renamed the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] upon the further addition of more clubs in a new [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]]. One club from each of these divisions would gain promotion to the Second Division, with the two relegated clubs being assigned to the more appropriate Third Division. To accommodate potential difficulties in this arrangement, clubs in the Midlands such as [[Mansfield Town F.C.|Mansfield Town]] or Walsall would sometimes be moved from one Third Division to the other.\n\nFollowing this burst of post-war growth, the League entered a prolonged period of relative stability with few changes in the membership, although there were changes on the pitch. In 1925, a new [[Offside (association football)|offside]] law reduced the number of defending opponents between the attacking player and the goal from three to two, leading to a large increase in goals, and numbers on shirts were introduced in 1939.\n\nBetween 1923 and 1926, [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] were the first team to win three consecutive league titles (and never won another one, though they finished as runners-up for the following two years). This was equalled by [[Arsenal]] between 1932 and 1935, during a period from 1930 to 1938 in which they won five titles out of eight.\n\n[[Manchester City]] (1936\u201337) became the only other club to be added to the list of Football League winners prior to the outbreak of the [[Second World War]], the fourteenth club to achieve the feat since 1888\u201389.\n\nIn the [[1938\u201339 Football League|1938-39]] season [[Everton F.C|Everton]] won the title for the fifth time, but suffered the same fate as in [[1914\u201315 Football League|1915]], being champions when football was suspended due to the World War.\n\n===Post-Second World War===\nThe League was suspended once more in 1939 with the outbreak of the Second World War, this time for seven seasons. The Third Divisions were expanded to 24 clubs each in 1950, bringing the total number of League clubs to 92, and in 1958 the decision was made to end the regionalisation of the Third Divisions and reorganise the clubs into a new nationwide Third Division and [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]]. To accomplish this, the clubs in the top half of both the Third Division North and South joined together to form the new Third Division, and those in the bottom half made up the Fourth Division. An earlier suggestion that the [[Football League Third Division South|Third Division South]] should become the [[Football League Third Division|Third Division]] and the [[Football League Third Division North|Third Division North]] become the [[Football League Fourth Division|Fourth Division]] on the basis of better attendances and that they tended to fare better when promoted was rejected.<ref name=\"D3 / D4 \u2013 original suggestion\">{{Cite book | last = Bowser | first = Paul | title = Bootham Crescent: A Second Home \u2013 Part  1 | year = 2019 | publisher =Minsterman Books | isbn = 978-1-9996907-0-0 | page = 219}}</ref> Four clubs were promoted and relegated between these two lower divisions, while two clubs exchanged places in the upper divisions until 1974, when the number increased to three.\n\nClubs to win their first League titles in the quarter-century following the Second World War were [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (1948\u201349 and 1949\u201350), [[Tottenham Hotspur]] (1950\u201351 and 1960\u201361), founder members of the League Wolverhampton Wanderers (1953\u201354, 1957\u201358 and 1958\u201359), [[Chelsea F.C|Chelsea]] (1954\u201355), [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] (1961\u201362) and [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] (1968\u201369).\n\n[[Tottenham Hotspur]] became the first club in the 20th century to win the League and [[F.A. Cup]] 'Double' in 1960\u201361, a season after [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]] had come within a whisker of achieving the feat themselves ([[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves]] won the 1959\u201360 [[F.A. Cup]] and were runners-up to [[Burnley]] in the League by a single point).\n\nPost-Second World War changes in league football included the use of white balls in 1951 and the first [[Floodlight#Association football|floodlit game]] (played between Portsmouth and [[Newcastle United]]) in 1956, opening up the possibility of midweek evening matches.\n\nBy far the biggest change for league clubs during this era was a new cup competition open to all the members of the League, the [[Football League Cup]], which was held for the first time in 1960\u201361 to provide clubs with a new source of income. Aston Villa won the inaugural League Cup and, despite an initial lack of enthusiasm on the part of some other big clubs, the competition became firmly established in the footballing calendar, although it was not until the dawn of the 1970s that all 92 Football League clubs regularly participated in the competition season after season.\n\nSubstitutes (1 per team per match) were first allowed for injured players in 1965, and for any reason the next year.\n\n===1970s===\n\nThe first ever Sunday EFL game was held on 20 January 1974 (11:30 kick off) and was played between 2nd Division rivals Millwall and Fulham at The Den. Millwall won 1-0. The first ever Sunday top flight game was between Chelsea and Stoke a week later.<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2010/jan/23/first-sunday-football-1974-millwall-fulham | title=20 January 1974: The first Sunday football | date=23 January 2010 | newspaper=The Guardian | accessdate=29 December 2018 }}</ref>\n\nBeginning with the 1976\u201377 season, the clubs finishing level on points began to be separated according to goal difference (the difference between goals scored and goals conceded) rather than goal average (goals scored divided by goals conceded). This was an effort to prevent unduly defensive play encouraged by the greater advantage in limiting goals allowed. In the event that clubs had equal points and equal goal differences, priority was given to the club that had scored the most goals. There has been only one season, 1988\u201389, when this level of differentiation was necessary to determine the League champion, and this was the occasion of one of the most dramatic nights in League history, when Arsenal beat Liverpool 2\u20130 at [[Anfield]] in [[Liverpool F.C. 0\u20132 Arsenal F.C. (26 May 1989)|the last game of the season]] to win the League on this tiebreaker \u2013 by a single [[Michael Thomas (footballer, born 1967)|Michael Thomas]] goal in the final minute of the final game of the season. Both teams would finish with the same amount of goal difference, but Arsenal scored more goals during the season.\n\nTwo clubs won their first League titles during the 1970s: founder members of the League Derby County (1971\u201372 and 1974\u201375) and Nottingham Forest (1977\u201378), both clubs managed by [[Brian Clough]] and [[Peter Taylor (footballer, born 1928)|Peter Taylor]]. Nottingham Forest's title in 1977\u201378 turned out to be the last occasion that a first-time champion won the First Division title during The Football League era, before the First Division clubs formed the Premier League in 1992. The next first-time League champion club would be Leicester City in the [[2015\u201316 Premier League|2015\u201316]] season, the first such during the Premier League era.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:The Football League logo (1988\u20132004).svg|frame|The logo of The Football League from 1988 until 2004]] -->\n\n===1980s===\nAnother important change was made in 1981, when it was decided to award [[three points for a win]] instead of two, a further effort to increase attacking football. (This scoring rule was not added by [[FIFA]] to the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]s until the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 cup]] after the perceived dominance of defensive play at [[1990 FIFA World Cup|Italia 90]].)\n\nThe early 1980s also saw a significant decline in league attendances as a result of the [[Early 1980s recession|recession]] and the ongoing problem of [[Football hooliganism|hooliganism]]. This did no favours for the financial position and league standing of numerous clubs, and several \u2013 including Wolverhampton Wanderers, [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] \u2013 were almost forced out of business as a result. The fortunes of the First Division clubs suffered a fresh blow in 1985 when all English clubs were banned from European competitions as a result of the [[Heysel disaster]], where rioting involving Liverpool fans at the [[1985 European Cup Final|European Cup final]] in Belgium resulted in 39 spectator deaths.\n\nIn a similar vein, playoffs to determine promotion places were introduced for the 1986\u201387 season so that more clubs remained eligible for promotion closer to the end of the season, and at the same time to aid in the reduction over two years of the number of clubs in the First Division from 22 to 20. For the first two seasons, the playoffs were contested between the lowest placed team to avoid automatic relegation and three highest placed teams to miss out on automatic promotion in the division below, before it was altered from the 1988\u201389 season to include just the four clubs who had missed out on automatic promotion in the Second, Third and Fourth Divisions. 1986\u201387 was the first season of the decade where Football League attendances increased, helped by improved economic conditions and falling unemployment nationally.\n\nAt the same time, automatic promotion and relegation between the Fourth Division and the [[Football Conference]] was introduced for one club, replacing the annual application for re-election to the League of the bottom four clubs and linking the League to the developing [[National League System]] pyramid.\n\nEmblematic of the confusion that was beginning to envelop the game, the number of clubs at the top of the league would return to 22 for the 1991\u201392 season, which increased competitiveness in the 1990\u201391 season as four teams would be promoted from the Second and Third Divisions instead of the normal three (with seventh place being the minimum position for the playoffs), while in the Fourth Division an unprecedented five promotion places were up for grabs, with eighth place being high enough for the playoffs. The end of the ban on English clubs in Europe also helped boost interest in English football. However, the economy was now in another [[Early 1990s recession|recession]], and added to that the clubs in the top two English divisions were faced with the requirement of having all-seater stadiums by 1994\u201395 to comply with the [[Taylor Report]] that followed the death of 96 Liverpool fans as a result of the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in April 1989.\n\nThe League also expanded to 93 clubs for the 1991\u201392 season and planned to raise the number again to 94 clubs for 1992\u201393, but after [[Aldershot F.C.|Aldershot]] and [[Maidstone United F.C. (1897)|Maidstone United]] both went out of business within a few months of each other in mid-1992, this plan was abandoned. The issues creating the uncertainty in the game all centred on money.\n\nThe increasing influence of money in English football was evident with such events as the first \u00a31m transfer in the game, that of [[Trevor Francis]] from [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] to Nottingham Forest in February 1979. The first \u00a32million player transferred between English clubs was [[Tony Cottee]], who moved from West Ham United to Everton in July 1988 \u2013 although several players had already been sold by English clubs to foreign clubs for even higher fees.\n\nBefore the formation of the FA Premier League, the highest transfer fee paid was \u00a32.9million for the transfer of [[Dean Saunders]] from Derby County to Liverpool during the 1991 close season. The first \u00a33million player was [[Alan Shearer]], who moved from [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] to Blackburn Rovers in July 1992, the summer before the first Premier League season. At the close of the 1991 season, a proposal for the establishment of a new league was tabled that would bring more money into the game overall. The Founder Members Agreement, signed on 17 July 1991 by the game's top-flight clubs, established the basic principles for setting up the FA Premier League.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |title=In the matter of an agreement between the Football Association Premier League Limited and the Football Association Limited and the Football League Limited and their respective member clubs |publisher=HM Courts Service |year=2006 |accessdate=8 August 2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222536/http://www.hmcourts-service.gov.uk/judgmentsfiles/j9/pljmtint.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref> The newly formed top division would have commercial independence from the Football Association and the Football League, giving the FA Premier League licence to negotiate its own [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship agreements.

There was no change in competition format; the same number of teams competed in the top flight, and promotion and relegation between the Premier League and the new First Division remained on the same terms as between the old First and Second Divisions.\n\nThe 1991\u201392 season had ended with 92 clubs in the Football League, with the 93rd club, Aldershot, having been declared bankrupt and forced to resign from the Fourth Division a few weeks before the end of the season. [[Colchester United F.C.|Colchester United]], the GM Vauxhall Conference champions, were promoted to the new Division Three as the 71st members of the reorganised Football League. However, this number would soon drop to 70 due to the closure of Maidstone United at the beginning of the 1992\u201393 season, and the Football League abandoned its expansion plan. This meant that there would once again be 92 clubs in the highest four divisions of English football.\n\n===1992\u20132004: Three divisions===\nThere were few major changes to the structure Football League in the 12 seasons which followed the breakaway that created the FA Premier League, perhaps the only notable changes being an expansion to 72 clubs from 70 for the 1995\u201396 season after the Premier League was streamlined to 20 clubs from 22, and the introduction of a second relegation place to the Football Conference from the end of the 2002\u201303 season.\n\nHowever, following the formation of the Premier League, it became increasingly difficult for newly promoted clubs to establish themselves in the top flight. Whereas newly promoted teams had once normally survived for at least a few seasons in the old First Division, it was now the norm for at least one newly promoted club to be relegated straight back from the Premier League to Division One. In the nine seasons that followed the formation of the Premier League, at least one newly promoted club suffered this fate \u2013 and in the 1997\u201398 season it happened to all three newly promoted teams. There were exceptions, however; including Blackburn Rovers, who were promoted to the Premier League on its formation and were champions three years later, and Newcastle United, who were promoted in 1993 and finished in the top six for the next four seasons, finishing Premier League runners-up twice.\n\nThe trend of relegated clubs to win an instant promotion back to the top flight continued, however. In the 12 seasons following the formation of the Premier League, there were just three seasons where none of the newly relegated sides failed to win an instant return to the Premier League.\n\nThe widening gulf between the top two divisions of English football can largely be put down to the increased wealth of the Premier League clubs, and the wealth gained by these clubs \u2013 combined with parachute payments following relegation \u2013 has also made it easier for many of them to quickly win promotion back to the top flight.\n\nIn spite of the economic prosperity between 1992 and 2004, many Football League clubs did run into financial problems during this time, although none of them were forced out of business. These include [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Luton Town F.C.|Luton Town]], Sheffield Wednesday, Nottingham Forest, Portsmouth, [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]] and Leicester City. Some of these clubs were faced with financial problems as a result of the lost revenue resulting from Premier League relegation and a failure to return to this level, as well as the collapse of [[ITV Digital]] in 2002.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/1896732.stm |title=ITV Digital goes broke |date=27 March 2002 |accessdate=10 August 2014 |publisher=BBC}}</ref>\n\nJust after the end of the 2001\u201302 season, [[South London]] based [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] were given permission to move to [[Milton Keynes]], some 70 miles from their traditional home. A relocation on this scale was unprecedented in English football, and led to the majority of the club's fans switching their support to a new fan-formed club, [[AFC Wimbledon]], who joined the [[Combined Counties Football League|Combined Counties League]]. The club's move to Milton Keynes was completed in September 2003, when they became tenants of the [[National Hockey Stadium (Milton Keynes)|National Hockey Stadium]] until a new permanent home was completed four years later, and the club's name changed to [[Milton Keynes Dons F.C.|Milton Keynes Dons]] in June 2004.\n[[File:The Football League.png|thumb|right|100px|Football League logo, 2004-2016]]\n\n===2004 Football League rebranding===\n[[2004-05 in English football|2004\u201305]] was the first season to feature the rebranded Football League.

The rebranding would include a new logo consisting of a circle composed of three swathes of 24 smaller circles each. The three swathes are to represent the three divisions and the 24 circles in each swathe (making a total of 72 circles) represent the 72 clubs in the league system. Each club is to be presented with its own bespoke version of the logo.

The financial health of its clubs had become perhaps the highest League priority due to the limited resources available. However, there were some promising signs for the future, as the League planned to announce new initiatives beginning with the 2004\u201305 season, coinciding with the start of a new sponsorship agreement with Coca-Cola. The first of these changes was a rebranding of the League with the renaming of the First Division as The Championship, the Second Division as League One and the Third Division as League Two.

The 1980s saw competition between terrestrial broadcasters for the rights to show League matches, but the arrival on the scene of satellite broadcaster [[Sky (United Kingdom)|British Sky Broadcasting]] (Sky TV), eagerly searching for attractive programming to build its customer base and willing to pay huge sums, changed the picture entirely. The League's top tier clubs had been agitating for several years to be able to keep more of the League's revenue for themselves, threatening to break away and form their own league if necessary. In 1992 the threat was realised as the First Division clubs left to establish the FA Premier League and signed a contract for exclusive live coverage of their games with Sky TV. The FA Premier League agreed to maintain the promotion and relegation of three clubs with The Football League, but The League was now in a far weaker position \u2013 without its best clubs and without the clout to negotiate high-revenue TV deals. This problem was exacerbated with the collapse in 2002 of ITV Digital, holder of TV rights for The Football League, which cost League clubs millions of pounds in revenue.\n\nIn 2001 the league signed a \u00a3315&nbsp;million deal with [[ITV Digital]], but in March 2002 the broadcaster was put into administration by its [[Carlton Communications|parent]] [[Granada plc|companies]] when the league refused to accept a \u00a3130&nbsp;million reduction in the deal. As a result, the Football League cuts off the deal and ITV Digital suffered the losses. In November 2007 the league announced a new domestic rights deal worth \u00a3264&nbsp;million with Sky and the BBC for the three seasons from 2009 to 2012. It covers Football League, League Cup and Football League Trophy matches and the full range of media: terrestrial and pay television, broadband internet, video-on-demand and mobile services. The deal represents a 135% increase on the previous deal and works out at an average of over \u00a31.2 million per club per season, though some clubs will receive more than others. Sky will provide the majority of the coverage and the BBC broadcast 10 exclusively live matches from the Championship per season and the semi-finals and finals of the League Cup.<ref>[http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10794~1160914,00.html Football League Agrees Historic Deal with Sky Sports and BBC] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071215071405/http://www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10794~1160914%2C00.html |date=15 December 2007 }}, ''www.football-league.premiumtv.co.uk'', 6 November 2007.</ref>\nIn 2012, Sky Sports signed a new exclusive deal to broadcast all matches after the BBC pulled out of the deal owing the financial cuts that the BBC Sport department was going through.

(Leeds United v. Watford, [[Millennium Stadium]])]]\nThe Football League Play-offs are used as a means of determining the final promotion place from each of the league's three divisions. This is a way of keeping the possibility of promotion open for more clubs towards the end of the season.\n\nThe format was first introduced in 1987, after the decision was made to reduce the top flight from 22 to 20 clubs over the next two seasons; initially, the play-offs involved the team finishing immediately above the relegation places in a given division and the three teams who finished immediately below the promotion places in the division below \u2013 essentially one team was fighting to keep their place in the higher division while the other three teams were attempting to take it from them. In 1989, this was changed\u2014instead of teams from different divisions playing each other, the four teams below the automatic promotion places contested the play-offs. The first season of this arrangement saw the final being contested in home and away legs. The four teams play-off in two semi-finals and a final, with the team winning the final being promoted. Originally the semi-finals and the final were all two-legged home-and-away affairs, but from 1990 onwards the final is a one-off match. It is in this format that the play-offs continue today. A proposal to have six teams rather than four competing for the final place was defeated at the league's AGM in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/2966968.stm |title=Play-off plans shelved |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 June 2003 |accessdate=25 March 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Play-off winners===\n{| class=wikitable \n|-\n!
