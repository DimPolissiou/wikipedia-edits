The intersection of circles whose centers are a radius width apart is a pair of equilateral arches, each of which can be inscribed with an equilateral triangle. They form faces of regular and uniform [[polyhedra]]. Three of the five [[Platonic solid]]s are composed of equilateral triangles.

Draw a straight line, and place the point of the compass on one end of the line, and swing an arc from that point to the other point of the line segment. Repeat with the other side of the line. Finally, connect the point where the two arcs intersect with each end of the line segment\n\nAn alternative method is to draw a circle with radius ''r'', place the point of the compass on the circle and draw another circle with the same radius. The two circles will intersect in two points. An equilateral triangle can be constructed by taking the two centers of the circles and either of the points of intersection.\n\nIn both methods a by-product is the formation of [[vesica piscis]].\n\nThe proof that the resulting figure is an equilateral triangle is the first proposition in Book I of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']].\n\n[[File:Equilateral_Triangle_Inscribed_in_a_Circle.gif|center]]\n\n==Derivation of area formula==\nThe area formula <math>A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2</math> in terms of side length ''a'' can be derived directly using the Pythagorean theorem or using trigonometry.\n\n===Using the Pythagorean theorem===\nThe area of a triangle is half of one side ''a'' times the height ''h'' from that side:\n:<math>A = \\frac{1}{2} ah.</math>\n\n[[File:30-60-90.svg|thumb|150px|An equilateral triangle with a side of 2 has a height of {{sqrt|3}} as the sine of 60\u00b0 is {{sqrt|3}}/2.]]\nThe legs of either right triangle formed by an altitude of the equilateral triangle are half of the base ''a'', and the hypotenuse is the side ''a'' of the equilateral triangle.

They form faces of regular and uniform [[polyhedra]]. Three of the five [[Platonic solid]]s are composed of equilateral triangles.

Finally, connect the point where the two arcs intersect with each end of the line segment\n\nAn alternative method is to draw a circle with radius ''r'', place the point of the compass on the circle and draw another circle with the same radius. The two circles will intersect in two points. An equilateral triangle can be constructed by taking the two centers of the circles and either of the points of intersection.\n\nIn both methods a by-product is the formation of [[vesica piscis]].\n\nThe proof that the resulting figure is an equilateral triangle is the first proposition in Book I of [[Euclid's Elements|Euclid's ''Elements'']].\n\n[[File:Equilateral_Triangle_Inscribed_in_a_Circle.gif|center]]\n\n==Derivation of area formula==\nThe area formula <math>A = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{4}a^2</math> in terms of side length ''a'' can be derived directly using the Pythagorean theorem or using trigonometry.\n\n===Using the Pythagorean theorem===\nThe area of a triangle is half of one side ''a'' times the height ''h'' from that side:\n:<math>A = \\frac{1}{2} ah.</math>\n\n[[File:30-60-90.svg|thumb|150px|An equilateral triangle with a side of 2 has a height of {{sqrt|3}} as the sine of 60\u00b0 is {{sqrt|3}}/2.]]\nThe legs of either right triangle formed by an altitude of the equilateral triangle are half of the base ''a'', and the hypotenuse is the side ''a'' of the equilateral triangle.

Put in other words: \"Ecosan systems safely recycle excreta resources (plant nutrients and organic matter) to crop production in such a way that the use of non-renewable resources is minimised\". When properly designed and operated, ecosan systems provide a hygienically safe, economical, and closed-loop system to convert human excreta into nutrients to be returned to the soil, and water to be returned to the land.

Providing [[Hand washing|handwashing]] facilities and [[Fecal sludge management|management of fecal sludge]] are also part of emergency sanitation. The [[Sphere Project]] handbook provides protection principles and core standards for sanitation to put in place after a disaster or conflict.\n\n=== Environmental sanitation ===\nEnvironmental sanitation encompasses the control of environmental factors that are connected to [[disease transmission]].

Examples are pit [[latrine]]s (no treatment) and [[septic tank]]s ([[primary treatment]] of wastewater). On-site sanitation systems are often connected to [[fecal sludge management]] systems where the fecal sludge that is generated onsite is treated at an offsite location. Wastewater ([[sewage]]) is only generated when piped [[water supply]] is available within the buildings or close to them.\n\nA related term is a [[decentralized wastewater system]] which refers in particular to the wastewater part of on-site sanitation. Similarly, an [[onsite sewage facility]] can treat the wastewater generated locally.\n\n===Safely managed sanitation===\n\nA relatively high level of sanitation service is now called \"safely managed sanitation\" by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]] definition. This is basic sanitation service where in addition excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite.<ref name=\"JMP2017\"/>\n\n=== Sustainable sanitation ===\n{{Main|Sustainable sanitation}}\n[[Sustainable sanitation]] considers the entire \"sanitation value chain\", from the experience of the user, [[Human excreta|excreta]] and [[wastewater]] collection methods, transportation or conveyance of waste, treatment, and reuse or disposal.<ref name=\"Tilley\"/> The term is widely used since about 2009. In 2007 the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] defined five sustainability criteria to compare the sustainability of sanitation systems.

Studies have suggested that the impact of hygiene practices have as great an impact on sanitation related diseases as the actual provision of sanitation facilities. Hygiene promotion is therefore an important part of sanitation and is usually key in maintaining good health.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Managing hygiene promotion in WASH programmes|last=Reed|first=Brian|last2=Bevan|first2=Jane|publisher=Water, Engineering and Development Centre (WEDC), Loughborough University|year=2014|isbn=978-1-84380-168-9|location=Leicestershire, UK|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHygiene promotion is a planned approach of enabling people to act and change their behaviour in an order to reduce and/or prevent incidences of [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene]] ([[WASH]]) related diseases. It usually involves a participatory approach of engaging people to take responsibility of WASH services and infrastructure including its operation and maintenance.

Commonly used indicators for [[bacteriological water analysis]] include the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (abbreviated as ''E. coli)'' and non-specific fecal [[coliforms]]''.'' With regards to samples of [[soil]], [[sewage sludge]], [[biosolids]] or fecal matter from [[dry toilet]]s, [[helminth]] eggs are a commonly used indicator. With helminth egg analysis, eggs are extracted from the sample after which a viability test is done to distinguish between viable and non viable eggs. The viable fraction of the helminth eggs in the sample is then counted.\n\n=== Wastewater and stormwater management ===\n{{Main|Wastewater|Wastewater treatment}}\n[[File:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|[[Sewage treatment]] plant, [[Australia]].]]\nWastewater management consists of collection, [[wastewater treatment]] (be it municipal or [[industrial wastewater]]), disposal or reuse of treated wastewater. The latter is also referred to as [[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]].\n\nSanitation systems in urban areas of developed countries usually consist of the collection of [[wastewater]] in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] for [[reuse]] or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. Sewers are either combined with [[storm drain]]s or separated from them as [[sanitary sewer]]s. [[Combined sewer]]s are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy [[stormwater|rainfall]] and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s, i.e., more or less diluted raw [[sewage]] being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.<ref>''Environmental [[Biotechnology]]: Advancement in Water And Wastewater Application'', edited by Z. Ujang, IWA Proceedings, [[Malaysia]] (2003)</ref>\n\nIn [[developing countries]] most wastewater is still discharged untreated into the environment. Alternatives to centralized sewer systems include [[onsite sanitation]],  [[decentralized wastewater system]]s, [[dry toilet]]s connected to [[fecal sludge management]].\n\n===Solid waste disposal===\n{{Main|Waste management}}\n[[File:Israel hiriya.jpg|thumb|[[Hiriya|Hiriya Landfill]], [[Israel]].]]\nDisposal of [[solid waste]] is most commonly conducted in [[landfill]]s, but incineration, [[recycling]], [[compost]]ing and conversion to [[biofuel]]s are also avenues.  In the case of landfills, [[advanced countries]] typically have rigid protocols for [[daily cover]] with topsoil, where [[underdeveloped countries]] customarily rely upon less stringent protocols.<ref>[[George Tchobanoglous]] and [[Frank Kreith]] ''Handbook of Solid Waste Management'', McGraw Hill (2002)</ref>  The importance of daily cover lies in the reduction of vector contact and spreading of [[pathogen]]s. Daily cover also minimises odor emissions and reduces windblown litter. Likewise, developed countries typically have requirements for perimeter sealing of the landfill with clay-type soils to minimize migration of [[leachate]] that could contaminate [[groundwater]] (and hence jeopardize some [[drinking water]] supplies).\n\nFor incineration options, the release of [[air pollutant]]s, including certain [[toxic]] components is an attendant adverse outcome.  Recycling and biofuel conversion are the [[sustainable]] options that generally have superior lifecycle costs, particularly when total [[ecological]] consequences are considered.<ref>William D. Robinson, ''The Solid Waste [[Handbook]]: A Practical Guide'', John Wiley and sons (1986)</ref> Composting value will ultimately be limited by the market demand for compost product.\n\n=== Climate change ===\n[[Global warming|Climate change]] can have negative impacts on existing sanitation services in several ways: damage and loss of services from [[flood]]s and reduced carrying capacity of waters receiving wastewater.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=Guy|last2=Calow|first2=Roger|last3=Macdonald|first3=Alan|last4=Bartram|first4=Jamie|date=2016|title=Climate Change and Water and Sanitation: Likely Impacts and Emerging Trends for Action|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|language=en|volume=41|issue=1|pages=253\u2013276|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-110615-085856|issn=1543-5938|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6861c1488a42b4ece793ebe6c56d7f10bfa52727}}</ref> Water and sanitation services contribute to [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]].

The specific goal for the year 2015 was to reduce by half the number of people who had no access to [[drinking water|potable water]] and sanitation in the baseline year of 1990. As the JMP and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) Human Development Report in 2006 has shown, progress meeting the MDG sanitation target is slow, with a large gap between the target coverage and the current reality.\n\nThere are numerous reasons for this gap. A major one is that sanitation is rarely given political attention received by other topics despite its key importance. Sanitation is not high on the international development agenda, and projects such as those relating to [[water supply]] projects are emphasised.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] (JMP) has been publishing reports of updated estimates every two years on the use of various types of drinking-water sources and sanitation facilities at the national, regional and global levels.

Maintaining and sustaining sanitation has aspects that are technological, institutional and social in nature. Sanitation infrastructure has to be adapted to several specific contexts including consumers' expectations and local resources available.\n\nSanitation technologies may involve centralized [[civil engineering]] structures like [[sewerage|sewer systems]], [[sewage treatment]], [[surface runoff]] treatment and solid waste [[landfill]]s. These structures are designed to treat [[wastewater]] and [[municipal solid waste]]. Sanitation technologies may also take the form of relatively simple onsite sanitation systems. This can in some cases consist of a simple [[pit latrine]] or other type of [[Dry toilet|non-flush toilet]] for the [[Human excreta|excreta]] management part.\n\nProviding sanitation to people requires attention to the entire system, not just focusing on technical aspects such as the [[toilet]], [[fecal sludge management]] or the [[wastewater treatment]] plant.<ref name=\"Tilley\">Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., L\u00fcthi, C., Reymond, Ph. and Zurbr\u00fcgg, C.

Put in other words: \"Ecosan systems safely recycle excreta resources (plant nutrients and organic matter) to crop production in such a way that the use of non-renewable resources is minimised\". When properly designed and operated, ecosan systems provide a hygienically safe, economical, and closed-loop system to convert human excreta into nutrients to be returned to the soil, and water to be returned to the land.

The short term phase might also involve technologies such as [[urine-diverting dry toilets]], [[septic tank]]s, [[decentralized wastewater system]]s. Providing [[Hand washing|handwashing]] facilities and [[Fecal sludge management|management of fecal sludge]] are also part of emergency sanitation. The [[Sphere Project]] handbook provides protection principles and core standards for sanitation to put in place after a disaster or conflict.\n\n=== Environmental sanitation ===\nEnvironmental sanitation encompasses the control of environmental factors that are connected to [[disease transmission]]. Subsets of this category are solid waste management, water and [[wastewater]] treatment, [[industrial waste]] treatment and noise pollution control.\n\n=== Improved and unimproved sanitation ===\n{{Main|Improved sanitation}}\n[[Improved sanitation]] and [[unimproved sanitation]] refers to the management of human feces at the household level. This terminology is the indicator used to describe the target of the [[Millennium Development Goal]] on sanitation, by the [[WHO]]/[[UNICEF]] [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]].\n\n=== Lack of sanitation ===\nLack of sanitation refers to the absence of sanitation. In practical terms it usually means lack of toilets or lack of hygienic toilets that anybody would want to use voluntarily.

Examples are pit [[latrine]]s (no treatment) and [[septic tank]]s ([[primary treatment]] of wastewater). On-site sanitation systems are often connected to [[fecal sludge management]] systems where the fecal sludge that is generated onsite is treated at an offsite location. Wastewater ([[sewage]]) is only generated when piped [[water supply]] is available within the buildings or close to them.\n\nA related term is a [[decentralized wastewater system]] which refers in particular to the wastewater part of on-site sanitation. Similarly, an [[onsite sewage facility]] can treat the wastewater generated locally.\n\n===Safely managed sanitation===\n\nA relatively high level of sanitation service is now called \"safely managed sanitation\" by the [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]] definition. This is basic sanitation service where in addition excreta are safely disposed of in situ or transported and treated offsite.<ref name=\"JMP2017\"/>\n\n=== Sustainable sanitation ===\n{{Main|Sustainable sanitation}}\n[[Sustainable sanitation]] considers the entire \"sanitation value chain\", from the experience of the user, [[Human excreta|excreta]] and [[wastewater]] collection methods, transportation or conveyance of waste, treatment, and reuse or disposal.<ref name=\"Tilley\"/> The term is widely used since about 2009. In 2007 the [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] defined five sustainability criteria to compare the sustainability of sanitation systems.

Lack of proper sanitation causes diseases. Most of the diseases resulting from sanitation have a direct relation to poverty.

Based on expert opinions and a literature survey, researchers at WHO arrived at the conclusion that approximately half of all cases of malnutrition (which often leads to stunting) in children under five is associated with repeated diarrhoea or intestinal worm infections as a result of unsafe water, inadequate sanitation or insufficient hygiene.<sup>[6]</sup>\n\n=== Diseases caused by lack of sanitation ===\nRelevant diseases and conditions caused by lack of sanitation and hygiene include:\n* [[Waterborne diseases]], which can contaminate drinking water\n* Diseases transmitted by the [[fecal-oral route]]\n** [[helminthiasis|Infections with intestinal helminths]] (worms) - approximately two billion people are infected with [[soil-transmitted helminths]] worldwide; they are transmitted by eggs present in human faeces which in turn contaminate soil in areas where sanitation is poor.<ref>WHO (2014) [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs366/en/ Soil-transmitted helminth infections], Fact sheet N\u00b0366\n</ref>\n* [[Stunted growth]] in children\n* [[Malnutrition]], particularly in children\n\nThe list of diseases that could be reduced with proper access to sanitation and hygiene practices is very long.

Studies have suggested that the impact of hygiene practices have as great an impact on sanitation related diseases as the actual provision of sanitation facilities. Hygiene promotion is therefore an important part of sanitation and is usually key in maintaining good health.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Managing hygiene promotion in WASH programmes|last=Reed|first=Brian|last2=Bevan|first2=Jane|publisher=Water, Engineering and Development Centre (WEDC), Loughborough University|year=2014|isbn=978-1-84380-168-9|location=Leicestershire, UK|pages=}}</ref>\n\nHygiene promotion is a planned approach of enabling people to act and change their behaviour in an order to reduce and/or prevent incidences of [[WASH|water, sanitation and hygiene]] ([[WASH]]) related diseases. It usually involves a participatory approach of engaging people to take responsibility of WASH services and infrastructure including its operation and maintenance. The three key elements of promoting hygiene are; mutual sharing of information and knowledge, the mobilisation of affected communities and the provision of essential material and facilities.<ref name=\"Sphere\">{{cite book|url=http://www.sphereproject.org/handbook/|title=Humanitarian charter and minimum standards in humanitarian response|last1=Project|first1=The Sphere|date=2011|publisher=Sphere Project|isbn=978-1-908176-00-4|edition=3rd ed., 2011|location=Geneva}}</ref>\n\n== Environmental aspects ==\n\n=== Indicator organisms ===\nWhen analysing environmental samples, various types of [[indicator organism]]s are used to check for fecal pollution of the sample. Commonly used indicators for [[bacteriological water analysis]] include the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (abbreviated as ''E. coli)'' and non-specific fecal [[coliforms]]''.'' With regards to samples of [[soil]], [[sewage sludge]], [[biosolids]] or fecal matter from [[dry toilet]]s, [[helminth]] eggs are a commonly used indicator. With helminth egg analysis, eggs are extracted from the sample after which a viability test is done to distinguish between viable and non viable eggs. The viable fraction of the helminth eggs in the sample is then counted.\n\n=== Wastewater and stormwater management ===\n{{Main|Wastewater|Wastewater treatment}}\n[[File:Wonga wetlands sewage plant.jpg|thumb|[[Sewage treatment]] plant, [[Australia]].]]\nWastewater management consists of collection, [[wastewater treatment]] (be it municipal or [[industrial wastewater]]), disposal or reuse of treated wastewater. The latter is also referred to as [[Reclaimed water|water reclamation]].\n\nSanitation systems in urban areas of developed countries usually consist of the collection of [[wastewater]] in gravity driven sewers, its treatment in [[Sewage treatment|wastewater treatment plants]] for [[reuse]] or disposal in rivers, lakes or the sea. Sewers are either combined with [[storm drain]]s or separated from them as [[sanitary sewer]]s. [[Combined sewer]]s are usually found in the central, older parts or urban areas. Heavy [[stormwater|rainfall]] and inadequate maintenance can lead to combined sewer overflows or [[sanitary sewer overflow]]s, i.e., more or less diluted raw [[sewage]] being discharged into the environment. Industries often discharge wastewater into municipal sewers, which can complicate wastewater treatment unless industries pre-treat their discharges.<ref>''Environmental [[Biotechnology]]: Advancement in Water And Wastewater Application'', edited by Z. Ujang, IWA Proceedings, [[Malaysia]] (2003)</ref>\n\nIn [[developing countries]] most wastewater is still discharged untreated into the environment. Alternatives to centralized sewer systems include [[onsite sanitation]],  [[decentralized wastewater system]]s, [[dry toilet]]s connected to [[fecal sludge management]].\n\n===Solid waste disposal===\n{{Main|Waste management}}\n[[File:Israel hiriya.jpg|thumb|[[Hiriya|Hiriya Landfill]], [[Israel]].]]\nDisposal of [[solid waste]] is most commonly conducted in [[landfill]]s, but incineration, [[recycling]], [[compost]]ing and conversion to [[biofuel]]s are also avenues.  In the case of landfills, [[advanced countries]] typically have rigid protocols for [[daily cover]] with topsoil, where [[underdeveloped countries]] customarily rely upon less stringent protocols.<ref>[[George Tchobanoglous]] and [[Frank Kreith]] ''Handbook of Solid Waste Management'', McGraw Hill (2002)</ref>  The importance of daily cover lies in the reduction of vector contact and spreading of [[pathogen]]s. Daily cover also minimises odor emissions and reduces windblown litter. Likewise, developed countries typically have requirements for perimeter sealing of the landfill with clay-type soils to minimize migration of [[leachate]] that could contaminate [[groundwater]] (and hence jeopardize some [[drinking water]] supplies).\n\nFor incineration options, the release of [[air pollutant]]s, including certain [[toxic]] components is an attendant adverse outcome.  Recycling and biofuel conversion are the [[sustainable]] options that generally have superior lifecycle costs, particularly when total [[ecological]] consequences are considered.<ref>William D. Robinson, ''The Solid Waste [[Handbook]]: A Practical Guide'', John Wiley and sons (1986)</ref> Composting value will ultimately be limited by the market demand for compost product.\n\n=== Climate change ===\n[[Global warming|Climate change]] can have negative impacts on existing sanitation services in several ways: damage and loss of services from [[flood]]s and reduced carrying capacity of waters receiving wastewater.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=Guy|last2=Calow|first2=Roger|last3=Macdonald|first3=Alan|last4=Bartram|first4=Jamie|date=2016|title=Climate Change and Water and Sanitation: Likely Impacts and Emerging Trends for Action|journal=Annual Review of Environment and Resources|language=en|volume=41|issue=1|pages=253\u2013276|doi=10.1146/annurev-environ-110615-085856|issn=1543-5938|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/6861c1488a42b4ece793ebe6c56d7f10bfa52727}}</ref> Water and sanitation services contribute to [[Greenhouse gas|greenhouse gas emissions]].

The specific goal for the year 2015 was to reduce by half the number of people who had no access to [[drinking water|potable water]] and sanitation in the baseline year of 1990. As the JMP and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP) Human Development Report in 2006 has shown, progress meeting the MDG sanitation target is slow, with a large gap between the target coverage and the current reality.\n\nThere are numerous reasons for this gap. A major one is that sanitation is rarely given political attention received by other topics despite its key importance. Sanitation is not high on the international development agenda, and projects such as those relating to [[water supply]] projects are emphasised.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}\n\nThe [[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation]] of [[WHO]] and [[UNICEF]] (JMP) has been publishing reports of updated estimates every two years on the use of various types of drinking-water sources and sanitation facilities at the national, regional and global levels.
