The city rose to prominence in the 17th century as a provincial capital and commercial center of the [[Mughal Empire]] in South Asia. Dhaka was the capital of the [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialised]] [[Mughal Bengal]] for 75 years. As the center of the [[muslin trade in Bengal]], it was one of the most prosperous cities in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The medieval city was named Jahangirabad in honor of the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]] and hosted the seat of the Mughal [[Subahdar]] (governor), [[Naib Nazim of Dhaka|Naib Nazims]] and [[Dewan]]s (prime ministers). Medieval Dhaka's glory peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was home to merchants from across [[Eurasia]]. The Mughals decorated the city with well-laid out gardens, tombs, mosques, palaces and forts.

The city rose to prominence in the 17th century as a provincial capital and commercial center of the [[Mughal Empire]] in South Asia. Dhaka was the capital of the [[proto-industrialization|proto-industrialised]] [[Mughal Bengal]] for 75 years. As the center of the [[muslin trade in Bengal]], it was one of the most prosperous cities in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The medieval city was named Jahangirabad in honor of the Mughal Emperor [[Jahangir]] and hosted the seat of the Mughal [[Subahdar]] (governor), [[Naib Nazim of Dhaka|Naib Nazims]] and [[Dewan]]s (prime ministers). Medieval Dhaka's glory peaked in the 17th and 18th centuries, when it was home to merchants from across [[Eurasia]]. The Mughals decorated the city with well-laid out gardens, tombs, mosques, palaces and forts. The city was once called the ''[[Venice of the East]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pj8cderhbr8C&pg=PA57|title=Cities and Natural Process: A Basis for Sustainability|first=Michael|last=Hough|date=1 January 2004|publisher=Psychology Press}}</ref> Under the [[British Empire]], the city saw the introduction of [[electricity]], [[railway]]s, cinemas, Western-style universities and colleges and a modern water supply.

[[Horse racing]] was a favorite pastime for elite residents in the city's Ramna Race Course beside the [[Dhaka Club]]. The [[Viceroy of India]] would often dine and entertain with Bengali aristocrats in the city.

Dhaka's urban population increased dramatically because of Muslim migration from across Bengal and other parts of the subcontinent.<ref>http://www.cdrb.org/journal/2003/3/3.pdf</ref> Dhaka began to see rapid urban expansion from the 1950s.

The [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] established a research center (now called [[ICDDR,B]]) for combating disease in 1960.\n\nAs early as 1947, there were demands for Dhaka to host the parliament of the federation of Pakistan. [[Shaista Suhrawardy Ikramullah]] stated that the country's Constituent Assembly should meet in East Bengal due to the region's large population. In 1962, President [[Ayub Khan (President of Pakistan)|Ayub Khan]] designated Dhaka as the seat of the proposed National Assembly outlined in the 1962 Constitution. The government appointed [[Louis Kahn]] and [[Muzharul Islam]] to design a capitol complex in Dhaka.

The executive brief for ''Sublimus Dei'' was withdrawn by the Pope after protests by the Spanish monarchy.

He was convicted of [[perjury]] in connection with this charge in 1950. Before the trial he was involved in the establishment of the [[United Nations]] both as a [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] official and as a U.N. official. In later life he worked as a lecturer and author.\n\nOn August 3, 1948, [[Whittaker Chambers]], a former [[Communist Party USA|U.S. Communist Party]] member, testified under subpoena before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) that Hiss had secretly been a communist while in federal service. Hiss categorically denied the charge.  During the [[Discovery (law)|pretrial discovery process]], Chambers produced new evidence indicating that he and Hiss had been involved in espionage. A federal [[grand jury]] indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury.  After a mistrial due to a [[hung jury]], Hiss was tried a second time, and in January 1950 he was found guilty and received two concurrent five-year sentences, of which he eventually served three and a half years.\n\nArguments about the case and the validity of the verdict took center stage in broader debates about the [[Cold War]], [[McCarthyism]], and the extent of [[Soviet espionage in the United States]].<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | last =Rosenbaum\n  | first =Ron\n  | title =Alger Hiss Rides Again\n  | magazine =Slate\n  | date =July 16, 2007\n  | url =http://www.slate.com/id/2170415/pagenum/all/\n  | accessdate = November 13, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071211231338/http://www.slate.com/id/2170415/pagenum/all/| archivedate= December 11, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\nSince Hiss' conviction, statements by involved parties and newly exposed evidence have added to the dispute.

Both parents came from substantial Baltimore families who could trace their roots to the middle of the eighteenth century.

Shortly after his marriage at age 24, Charles Hiss entered the business world and joined the [[dry goods]] importing firm Daniel Miller and Co. He did well, becoming an executive and stockholder. When Charles's brother John died suddenly at age 33, Charles assumed financial and emotional responsibility for his brother's widow and six children in addition to his own expanding family.<ref name= tissue256 /> Charles also helped his wife's favorite brother, Albert Hughes, find work at Daniel Miller. Hughes at first distinguished himself and was promoted to treasurer of the firm, but then he became involved in a complicated business deal and was unable to meet the financial obligation that was part of a joint agreement.<ref name= tissue256 /> As a matter of honor, Charles Hiss felt compelled to sell all his stocks to make good his brother-in-law's debts, as well as to resign from the firm. This was in 1907, the year of [[Panic of 1907|a great financial panic]]. After inconclusive attempts by relatives to find him a job, Charles fell into a serious depression and committed suicide, cutting his throat with a razor. Minnie, who had made the most of her former prosperity and social position, now had to rely on her inheritance and assistance from family members.\n\nAlger Hiss was two years old at the time of his father's death, and his brother Donald was two months old. As was customary in those days, they were not told of the circumstances of Charles Hiss's death. When Alger learned of it inadvertently years later from neighbors, he angrily confronted his older brother Bosley, who then told him the truth. Shocked, Hiss resolved to devote the rest of his life to restoring the family's \"good name\".<ref name= tissue256 />\n\nAlthough shadowed by melancholy, Hiss's early childhood, spent in rough-and-tumble games with his siblings and cousins who lived close by, was not unhappy. Their Baltimore neighborhood was described by columnist [[Murray Kempton]] as one of \"shabby gentility.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Kempton\n  | first = Murray\n  | title = Part of Our Time: Some Ruins and Monuments of the Thirties\n  | publisher = New York Review of Books\n  | page = 17\n  | year = 2012\n  | isbn = 978-1590175446\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GMFS5ww8v98C\n  | accessdate = January 26, 2015}}</ref> Hiss, however, portrayed the economic circumstances of his childhood as \"modest\", but \"not particularly shabby\".<ref name= LGlass4>{{Cite book\n  | last = White\n  | first = G.

In 1929, he received his law degree from [[Harvard Law School]], where he was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Felix Frankfurter]], the future [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] justice. During his time at Harvard, the famous murder trial of anarchists [[Sacco and Vanzetti|Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti]] transpired, ending in their conviction and execution. Like Frankfurter, who wrote a book about the case, and like many prominent liberals of the day, Hiss maintained that Sacco and Vanzetti were convicted unjustly.\n\nHiss served for a year as clerk to Supreme Court Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], before joining [[Choate, Hall & Stewart]], a Boston law firm, and later the New York law firm then known as [[Cahill, Gordon & Reindel|Cotton, Franklin, Wright & Gordon]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Career==\nDuring the era of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], Hiss became a government attorney. In 1933, he served briefly at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and then became a temporary assistant on the Senate's [[Nye Committee]], investigating cost overruns and alleged profiteering by military contractors during World War I.<ref>See [https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/merchants_of_death.htm \"Merchants of Death\"], on the U.S. Senate website.</ref> During this period, Hiss was also a member of the liberal legal team headed by [[Jerome Frank (lawyer)|Jerome Frank]] that defended the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] (AAA) against challenges to its legitimacy. Because of intense opposition from agribusiness in Arkansas, Frank and his left-wing assistants, who included future labor lawyer [[Lee Pressman]], were fired in 1935 in what came to be known as \"the purge of liberals\".<ref>The following year the Supreme Court ruled the AAA unconstitutional, though Congress reinstated it in 1938.

By introducing the Baltimore documents, Chambers admitted he had previously lied, opening both Hiss and himself to perjury charges. Chambers also gave a new date for his own break with the Communist Party, an important point in his accusations against Hiss. For over nine years, beginning September 1, 1939, he had claimed to have quit the Party in 1937. Chambers now began to claim the actual date was sometime in early March 1938, the year of the \"Baltimore documents\", before finally settling during the trial, on April 15, 1938.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5tICAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 Sidney Zion, \"The Hiss Case, a mystery ignored,\" ''New York Magazine'', April 24, 1978, pp. 10\u201311].</ref><ref>\n{{Cite news\n  | last = Navasky\n  | first =Victor\n  | title = The Case Not Proved Against Alger Hiss\n  | date =April 8, 1978\n  | work =[[The Nation]]\n  | url = http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/navasky.html\n  | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name = Cook>\n{{Cite book\n  | last = Cook\n  | first = Fred J.\n  | title = The Unfinished Story of Alger Hiss\n  | publisher = William Morrow Company\n  | year = 1958\n  | pages = 19: pp. 69\u201373: pp. 75\u201381 pp 155: pp. 126: pp. 147\u2013151: pp. 156\n  | isbn = 978-1-131-85352-9 }}</ref>\n\nOn December 2, Chambers led HUAC investigators to a pumpkin patch on his [[Maryland]] farm; from a hollowed-out pumpkin in which he had hidden them the previous day, he produced five rolls of 35&nbsp;mm film that he said came from Hiss in 1938, as well. While some of the film was undeveloped and some contained images of trivial content such as publicly available Navy documents concerning the painting of fire extinguishers, there were also images of State Department documents that were classified at the time. As a consequence of the revelation's dramatic staging, both the film and the Baltimore documents soon became known collectively as the \"Pumpkin Papers\".<ref name = Weins/>\n\n==Perjury trials and conviction==\n[[File:Mugs(14).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Alger Hiss in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary <br />(Photos courtesy of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]])]]\nThe grand jury charged Hiss with two counts of [[perjury]]\u2014it did not indict him for [[espionage]] since the [[statute of limitations|period of limitations]] had run out. Chambers was never charged with a crime. Hiss went to trial twice. The first trial, presided over by Judge [[Samuel Kaufman]], started on May 31, 1949, and ended in a hung jury on July 7. Chambers admitted on the witness stand that he had previously committed perjury several times while he was under oath, including deliberately falsifying key dates in his story. Hiss's character witnesses at his first trial included such notables as future Democratic presidential candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], Supreme Court Justices [[Felix Frankfurter]], and [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]], and former Democratic presidential candidate [[John W. Davis]]. President Truman famously called the investigation \"a red herring\".<ref>\"Truman thought the anti-communist hearings were 'a red herring to keep people from doing what they ought to do. They are slandering people who don't deserve it.'\" ([[David McCullough]], ''[[Truman (book)|Truman]]'', [New York: Simon and Schuster], p. 652). Truman told oral biographer, Merle Miller, \"What they were trying to do, all those birds,\" he said, \"they were trying to get the Democrats. They were trying to get me out of the White House, and they would go to any lengths to do it.... They did do just about anything they could think of, all that witch hunting.... The constitution has never been in so much danger....\" (quoted in Anthony Summers (2000), p. 65). Miller's accuracy in reporting Truman's statements has been questioned by some.</ref> The second trial, presided over by Judge [[Henry W. Goddard]], lasted from November 17, 1949, to January 21, 1950.\n\nAt both trials, a key to the prosecution's case was testimony from expert witnesses, stating that identifying characteristics of the typed Baltimore documents matched samples typed on a typewriter owned by the Hisses at the time of his alleged espionage work with Chambers. The prosecution also presented as evidence the typewriter itself. Given away years earlier, it had been located by defense investigators. This trial resulted in an eight-to-four deadlocked jury. \"That, according to one of Hiss's friends and lawyers, [[Helen Lehman Buttenweiser|Helen Buttenweiser]], was the only time that she had ever seen Alger shocked\u2014stunned by the fact that eight of his fellow citizens did not believe him.\"<ref>Halberstam, David.

As a well-educated and highly connected government official from an old American family, Alger Hiss did not fit the profile of a typical spy.\n\nPublicity surrounding the case thrust [[Richard M. Nixon]] into the public spotlight, helping him move from the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1950, to the [[Vice Presidency of the United States]] in 1952, and finally to [[President of the United States]] in 1968.\n\nSenator [[Joseph McCarthy]] made his famous [[The Wheeling speech|speech at Wheeling, West Virginia]], two weeks after the Hiss verdict, launching his career as the nation's most visible anti-communist.\n\n==Incarceration==\nAlthough he had been sentenced to five years' imprisonment, Hiss served only three years and eight months in [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary|Lewisburg Federal Prison]]. He was released from prison on November 27, 1954.\n\nWhile in prison, Hiss acted as a volunteer attorney, adviser, and tutor for many of his fellow inmates.\n\n==Post-incarceration==\nAfter his release in 1954, Hiss, who had been [[Disbarment|disbarred]], worked as a salesman for the stationery company S.

As early as December 1948 the chief investigator for the Hiss defense, Horace W. Schmahl, set off a race to find Hiss's typewriter.<ref>\n{{cite news\n | title =Sleuth \"Hired by Hiss\" Touched Off Hunt for Typewriter Here\n | work =Philadelphia Evening Bulletin\n | hdl =2027/spo.hiss1111.0182.001\n | date = December 14, 1948}}\n</ref> The FBI, with superior resources, was also searching for the typewriter, which the Hiss family had discarded some years earlier. Nevertheless, Schmahl was able to track it down first, and the Hiss defense introduced it with the intention of showing that its typeface would not be a match for that on the FBI's documents. Surprisingly, however, the typefaces proved to be an excellent match and confirmed the FBI's evidence. Schmahl subsequently changed sides and went to work for the prosecution.\n\nAfter Hiss had gone to prison, his lawyer, Chester T. Lane, acting on a tip he had received from someone who had worked with Schmahl that Hiss might have been framed, filed a motion in January 1952 for a new trial.<ref>After Hiss had been jailed, his lawyer Chester Lane received a tip that \"'Schmahl was implicated with the typewriter.' An investigator who had worked with Schmahl, Harold Bretnall, subsequently told the lawyer that Schmahl had been involved in forging the Hiss typewriter. 'Hiss', Bretnall said, 'was framed.' Schmahl, tracked down in 1973, admitted to a Hiss investigator he had been a 'consultant' on the typewriter forgery. He said the OSS had set Hiss up\u2014just when was not clear\u2014and the orders had come from through [OSS Director] [[William Joseph Donovan|Donovan]]'s law firm, Donovan, Leisure. Schmahl later retracted his statements and declined further interviews.\" (Summers (2000), p. 73).</ref> Lane sought to show that (1) forgery by typewriter was feasible and (2) such forgery had occurred in the Hiss case. Unaware that the feasibility of such forgeries had already been established throughout the War by the military intelligence services that engaged in such practices, the Hiss defense sought to establish feasibility directly by hiring a civilian typewriter expert, [[Martin Tytell]], to create a typewriter that would be indistinguishable from the one the Hisses owned. Tytell spent two years creating a facsimile Woodstock typewriter whose print characteristics would match the peculiarities of the Hiss typewriter.<ref>Squier, Michael.

According to former Woodstock executives, the production date of a machine could be inferred from the machine's serial number. The serial number on the Exhibit #UUU typewriter indicated that it would have been ''manufactured'' after the man who sold the Hiss machine had retired from the company and the salesman insisted that he did not sell any typewriters after his retirement. Decades later, when FBI files were disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, it turned out that the FBI had also doubted that the trial exhibit was Hiss's machine and for exactly the same reasons; although the FBI expressed these concerns internally as the first trial was about to begin, the public did not learn about the FBI's doubts until the mid-1970s.<ref>\n{{cite news\n | author =John Lowenthal\n | title =What the FBI knew and hid\n | work =The Nation\n | url =http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/lowenthaltyp.html\n | date = June 26, 1976\n | accessdate = July 12, 2010\n }}\n</ref>\n\nTo explain why typing from Exhibit #UUU seemed indistinguishable from the typing on Hiss's old machine, Lane assembled experts prepared to testify that Exhibit #UUU had been tampered with in a way inconsistent with professional repair work to make it type like Hiss's old typewriter.

When first issued by the White House the phrase had been transcribed as \"we got a typewriter\", the official transcript was subsequently amended to read \"We got Piper [the name of Hiss's lawyer's law firm].\" The context for the remark was a conversation with John Dean in which Nixon states that [[J.

In late 1948, when the Hiss defense and the FBI began hunting for the Woodstock typewriter, a man named Horace Schmahl joined the defense team as an investigator.

An American citizen from a Quaker family who had grown up in Switzerland, Field attended Harvard and worked in the US Foreign Service from 1929 until 1936, when he left the State Department for a job at the League of Nations in Geneva, helping refugees from the Spanish Civil War. During World War II, Field, who never concealed he was a communist, headed a Unitarian Services organization to aid displaced persons in Marseilles, before fleeing to Geneva, where he collaborated with Allen Dulles of the OSS (who was based in Bern). In 1948, when the Hiss trials started, Field and his German wife were still living in Switzerland. By 1949 Field was broke, having been fired from the U.S.-based Unitarian Service Committee for his communist associations. Wishing to avoid returning to the United States and possibly having to testify before Congress, Field traveled to [[Prague]], hoping to be hired as a lecturer at the [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]].<ref>Field lacked confidence he could stand up under testimony: \"Alger defended himself ... with great intelligence. He had been trained as a lawyer and knew all the phrases and tricks. I, on the other hand, had no such experience.... I did not trust myself to stand before my accusers and shout 'innocent' in their faces.... I also understood the same from a short letter from Hiss, who obviously could not write openly,\" he stated.

Field was accused of having organized an anti-communist resistance network in Eastern Europe for the OSS during the war and later for the new CIA<ref>James Srodes, ''Allen Dulles: Master of Spies'' (Regnery, 2000), p. 412.</ref> and was held for five years in solitary confinement.<ref>It has been suggested that Field was a victim of a disinformation campaign by Allen Dulles called [https://archive.org/details/operationsplinte00stev \"Operation Splinter Factor\"], see [https://archive.org/details/pdfy-q0ULBH2DJICRS3Vg <!-- quote=Field. --> William Blum, ''Killing Hope: US Military and CIA Interventions Since World War II'' (London: Zed Books, 2003) p. 58], and even the inspiration for John le Carr\u00e9's thriller, ''[[The Spy Who Came In From the Cold]]'', but the CIA disputes these theories.

I was indiscreet enough to tell him he had come too late.\" This agreed with [[Hede Massing]]'s assertion to US authorities in 1947 that when she attempted to recruit Noel Field for one Soviet spy network (the [[OGPU]]), Field had replied that he already worked for another (the [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]]). (Massing repeated this story at Hiss's second trial when she testified that at a party at Noel Field's house in 1935 she had obliquely joked with Hiss about recruiting Noel Field.<ref>[http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/hedem.html ''The Alger Hiss Story: The Cast: Hede Massing''].

He was convicted of [[perjury]] in connection with this charge in 1950. Before the trial he was involved in the establishment of the [[United Nations]] both as a [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] official and as a U.N. official. In later life he worked as a lecturer and author.\n\nOn August 3, 1948, [[Whittaker Chambers]], a former [[Communist Party USA|U.S. Communist Party]] member, testified under subpoena before the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]] (HUAC) that Hiss had secretly been a communist while in federal service. Hiss categorically denied the charge.  During the [[Discovery (law)|pretrial discovery process]], Chambers produced new evidence indicating that he and Hiss had been involved in espionage. A federal [[grand jury]] indicted Hiss on two counts of perjury.  After a mistrial due to a [[hung jury]], Hiss was tried a second time, and in January 1950 he was found guilty and received two concurrent five-year sentences, of which he eventually served three and a half years.\n\nArguments about the case and the validity of the verdict took center stage in broader debates about the [[Cold War]], [[McCarthyism]], and the extent of [[Soviet espionage in the United States]].<ref>{{cite magazine\n  | last =Rosenbaum\n  | first =Ron\n  | title =Alger Hiss Rides Again\n  | magazine =Slate\n  | date =July 16, 2007\n  | url =http://www.slate.com/id/2170415/pagenum/all/\n  | accessdate = November 13, 2007 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071211231338/http://www.slate.com/id/2170415/pagenum/all/| archivedate= December 11, 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref>\nSince Hiss' conviction, statements by involved parties and newly exposed evidence have added to the dispute.

Both parents came from substantial Baltimore families who could trace their roots to the middle of the eighteenth century. Hiss's paternal great-great-grandfather had emigrated from [[Germany]] in 1729, married well, and changed his surname from \"Hesse\" to \"Hiss\".<ref name= tissue256>{{cite book| first1= Morton| last1= Levitt| first2= Michael| last2= Levitt| title= A Tissue Of Lies: Nixon vs. Hiss| place= New York| publisher= McGraw Hill| year= 1979| pages= 255\u201356}}</ref> Minnie Hughes had attended teacher's college and was active in Baltimore society. Shortly after his marriage at age 24, Charles Hiss entered the business world and joined the [[dry goods]] importing firm Daniel Miller and Co. He did well, becoming an executive and stockholder. When Charles's brother John died suddenly at age 33, Charles assumed financial and emotional responsibility for his brother's widow and six children in addition to his own expanding family.<ref name= tissue256 /> Charles also helped his wife's favorite brother, Albert Hughes, find work at Daniel Miller. Hughes at first distinguished himself and was promoted to treasurer of the firm, but then he became involved in a complicated business deal and was unable to meet the financial obligation that was part of a joint agreement.<ref name= tissue256 /> As a matter of honor, Charles Hiss felt compelled to sell all his stocks to make good his brother-in-law's debts, as well as to resign from the firm. This was in 1907, the year of [[Panic of 1907|a great financial panic]]. After inconclusive attempts by relatives to find him a job, Charles fell into a serious depression and committed suicide, cutting his throat with a razor. Minnie, who had made the most of her former prosperity and social position, now had to rely on her inheritance and assistance from family members.\n\nAlger Hiss was two years old at the time of his father's death, and his brother Donald was two months old. As was customary in those days, they were not told of the circumstances of Charles Hiss's death. When Alger learned of it inadvertently years later from neighbors, he angrily confronted his older brother Bosley, who then told him the truth. Shocked, Hiss resolved to devote the rest of his life to restoring the family's \"good name\".<ref name= tissue256 />\n\nAlthough shadowed by melancholy, Hiss's early childhood, spent in rough-and-tumble games with his siblings and cousins who lived close by, was not unhappy. Their Baltimore neighborhood was described by columnist [[Murray Kempton]] as one of \"shabby gentility.\"<ref>{{Cite book\n  | last = Kempton\n  | first = Murray\n  | title = Part of Our Time: Some Ruins and Monuments of the Thirties\n  | publisher = New York Review of Books\n  | page = 17\n  | year = 2012\n  | isbn = 978-1590175446\n  | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GMFS5ww8v98C\n  | accessdate = January 26, 2015}}</ref> Hiss, however, portrayed the economic circumstances of his childhood as \"modest\", but \"not particularly shabby\".<ref name= LGlass4>{{Cite book\n  | last = White\n  | first = G.

At school he was popular and high performing. He attended high school at [[Baltimore City College]] and college at [[Johns Hopkins University]], where he was voted \"most popular student\" by his classmates and graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. In 1929, he received his law degree from [[Harvard Law School]], where he was a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Felix Frankfurter]], the future [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] justice. During his time at Harvard, the famous murder trial of anarchists [[Sacco and Vanzetti|Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti]] transpired, ending in their conviction and execution. Like Frankfurter, who wrote a book about the case, and like many prominent liberals of the day, Hiss maintained that Sacco and Vanzetti were convicted unjustly.\n\nHiss served for a year as clerk to Supreme Court Justice [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]], before joining [[Choate, Hall & Stewart]], a Boston law firm, and later the New York law firm then known as [[Cahill, Gordon & Reindel|Cotton, Franklin, Wright & Gordon]].{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Career==\nDuring the era of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]], Hiss became a government attorney. In 1933, he served briefly at the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] and then became a temporary assistant on the Senate's [[Nye Committee]], investigating cost overruns and alleged profiteering by military contractors during World War I.<ref>See [https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/merchants_of_death.htm \"Merchants of Death\"], on the U.S. Senate website.</ref> During this period, Hiss was also a member of the liberal legal team headed by [[Jerome Frank (lawyer)|Jerome Frank]] that defended the [[Agricultural Adjustment Administration]] (AAA) against challenges to its legitimacy. Because of intense opposition from agribusiness in Arkansas, Frank and his left-wing assistants, who included future labor lawyer [[Lee Pressman]], were fired in 1935 in what came to be known as \"the purge of liberals\".<ref>The following year the Supreme Court ruled the AAA unconstitutional, though Congress reinstated it in 1938.

Negotiations addressed the postwar division of Europe and configuration of its borders; reparations and de-Nazification; and the still unfinished plans, carried over from Dumbarton Oaks, for the United Nations.

When, on the national radio program ''[[Meet the Press]]'', Chambers publicly called Hiss a communist, Hiss had attorney [[William L. Marbury Jr.]] file a libel lawsuit against him.\n\nChambers retaliated by claiming Hiss was not merely a communist, but also a spy, a charge he had not made earlier; and, on November 17, 1948, to support his explosive allegations he produced physical evidence consisting of sixty-five pages of re-typed State Department documents, the last of which was dated April 1, 1938, plus four notes in Hiss's handwriting summarizing the contents of State Department cables. These became known as the \"Baltimore documents\". Chambers claimed Hiss had given them to him in 1938 and that Priscilla had retyped them (Hiss could not type) on the Hisses' Woodstock typewriter for Chambers to pass along to the Soviets.<ref name = Weins/> One of the handwritten notes copied the contents of a telegram (received January 28, 1938)<ref>[http://www.documentstalk.com/wp/henderson-cable-january-28-1938 Scanned original of Henderson cable from January 28, 1938, at website ''Documents Talk'']</ref> related to the November and December 1937 arrest and disappearance in Moscow of a Latvian-born man and his wife, an American citizen.<ref>See: [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19380107&id=eFIbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6ksEAAAAIBAJ&pg=1657,2015004 United Press, \"Robinson Case Leads to a Trail of Racketeers\" and \"Mrs. Robinson Reportedly Executed,\" ''Pittsburg Press'', January 7, 1938, p. 1;] and [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19380109&id=RLMhAAAAIBAJ&sjid=x5sFAAAAIBAJ&pg=4422,1593223 Associated Press, \"Passport Mystery Baffles Probers: Case of Robinson-Rubens linked to racket,\" ''Reading Eagle'', January 9, 1938, pages 1 & 16.]</ref> Under questioning, neither Hiss nor his superior, Francis Sayre, recollected the incident.

By introducing the Baltimore documents, Chambers admitted he had previously lied, opening both Hiss and himself to perjury charges. Chambers also gave a new date for his own break with the Communist Party, an important point in his accusations against Hiss. For over nine years, beginning September 1, 1939, he had claimed to have quit the Party in 1937. Chambers now began to claim the actual date was sometime in early March 1938, the year of the \"Baltimore documents\", before finally settling during the trial, on April 15, 1938.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=5tICAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA10 Sidney Zion, \"The Hiss Case, a mystery ignored,\" ''New York Magazine'', April 24, 1978, pp. 10\u201311].</ref><ref>\n{{Cite news\n  | last = Navasky\n  | first =Victor\n  | title = The Case Not Proved Against Alger Hiss\n  | date =April 8, 1978\n  | work =[[The Nation]]\n  | url = http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/navasky.html\n  | accessdate = }}</ref><ref name = Cook>\n{{Cite book\n  | last = Cook\n  | first = Fred J.\n  | title = The Unfinished Story of Alger Hiss\n  | publisher = William Morrow Company\n  | year = 1958\n  | pages = 19: pp. 69\u201373: pp. 75\u201381 pp 155: pp. 126: pp. 147\u2013151: pp. 156\n  | isbn = 978-1-131-85352-9 }}</ref>\n\nOn December 2, Chambers led HUAC investigators to a pumpkin patch on his [[Maryland]] farm; from a hollowed-out pumpkin in which he had hidden them the previous day, he produced five rolls of 35&nbsp;mm film that he said came from Hiss in 1938, as well. While some of the film was undeveloped and some contained images of trivial content such as publicly available Navy documents concerning the painting of fire extinguishers, there were also images of State Department documents that were classified at the time. As a consequence of the revelation's dramatic staging, both the film and the Baltimore documents soon became known collectively as the \"Pumpkin Papers\".<ref name = Weins/>\n\n==Perjury trials and conviction==\n[[File:Mugs(14).jpg|thumb|right|300px|Alger Hiss in Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary <br />(Photos courtesy of the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]])]]\nThe grand jury charged Hiss with two counts of [[perjury]]\u2014it did not indict him for [[espionage]] since the [[statute of limitations|period of limitations]] had run out. Chambers was never charged with a crime. Hiss went to trial twice. The first trial, presided over by Judge [[Samuel Kaufman]], started on May 31, 1949, and ended in a hung jury on July 7. Chambers admitted on the witness stand that he had previously committed perjury several times while he was under oath, including deliberately falsifying key dates in his story. Hiss's character witnesses at his first trial included such notables as future Democratic presidential candidate [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]], Supreme Court Justices [[Felix Frankfurter]], and [[Stanley Forman Reed|Stanley Reed]], and former Democratic presidential candidate [[John W. Davis]]. President Truman famously called the investigation \"a red herring\".<ref>\"Truman thought the anti-communist hearings were 'a red herring to keep people from doing what they ought to do. They are slandering people who don't deserve it.'\" ([[David McCullough]], ''[[Truman (book)|Truman]]'', [New York: Simon and Schuster], p. 652). Truman told oral biographer, Merle Miller, \"What they were trying to do, all those birds,\" he said, \"they were trying to get the Democrats. They were trying to get me out of the White House, and they would go to any lengths to do it.... They did do just about anything they could think of, all that witch hunting.... The constitution has never been in so much danger....\" (quoted in Anthony Summers (2000), p. 65). Miller's accuracy in reporting Truman's statements has been questioned by some.</ref> The second trial, presided over by Judge [[Henry W. Goddard]], lasted from November 17, 1949, to January 21, 1950.\n\nAt both trials, a key to the prosecution's case was testimony from expert witnesses, stating that identifying characteristics of the typed Baltimore documents matched samples typed on a typewriter owned by the Hisses at the time of his alleged espionage work with Chambers. The prosecution also presented as evidence the typewriter itself. Given away years earlier, it had been located by defense investigators. This trial resulted in an eight-to-four deadlocked jury. \"That, according to one of Hiss's friends and lawyers, [[Helen Lehman Buttenweiser|Helen Buttenweiser]], was the only time that she had ever seen Alger shocked\u2014stunned by the fact that eight of his fellow citizens did not believe him.\"<ref>Halberstam, David. ''[[The Fifties (book)|The Fifties]]'', (New York: Random House, 1993), 16. Halberstam concludes that \"Whether Hiss actually participated in espionage was never proved and the evidence was, at best, flawed\" (14\u201325).</ref>\n\nIn the second trial, [[Hede Massing]], an Austrian-born confessed Soviet spy who was being threatened with deportation, and whom the first judge had not permitted to testify, provided some slight corroboration of Chambers's story. She recounted meeting Hiss at a party in 1935.<ref name = Cook/> Massing also described how Hiss had tried to recruit Noel Field, another Soviet spy at State, to switch from Massing's ring to his own.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v44i5a01p.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070711114701/https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/docs/v44i5a01p.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2007-07-11|title=The Alger Hiss Case \u2014 Central Intelligence Agency|date=2007-07-11|access-date=2018-09-12}}</ref><ref>Summers, Anthony.

According to Anthony Summers, \"Hiss spoke only two sentences in court after he had been found guilty. The first was to thank the judge. The second was to assert that one day in the future it would be disclosed how forgery by typewriter had been committed.\"<ref>Summers (2000), p. 71.</ref>\n\nOn January 25, 1950, Judge Goddard sentenced Hiss to five years' imprisonment on each of the two counts, to run concurrently.\n\nAt a subsequent press conference, Secretary of State [[Dean Acheson]] reacted emotionally, affirming, \"I do not intend to turn my back on Alger Hiss.\" Acheson quoted Jesus in the [[Bible]]: \"I was a Stranger and ye took me in; Naked, and ye clothed me; I was sick and ye visited me; I was in prison and ye came unto me.\" Acheson's remarks enraged Nixon, who called Acheson's words sacrilege.<ref>Perlstein, ''Nixonland'', p. 33.</ref> The verdict was upheld by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]],<ref>{{cite court |litigants=United States v.

As a well-educated and highly connected government official from an old American family, Alger Hiss did not fit the profile of a typical spy.\n\nPublicity surrounding the case thrust [[Richard M. Nixon]] into the public spotlight, helping him move from the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 1950, to the [[Vice Presidency of the United States]] in 1952, and finally to [[President of the United States]] in 1968.\n\nSenator [[Joseph McCarthy]] made his famous [[The Wheeling speech|speech at Wheeling, West Virginia]], two weeks after the Hiss verdict, launching his career as the nation's most visible anti-communist.\n\n==Incarceration==\nAlthough he had been sentenced to five years' imprisonment, Hiss served only three years and eight months in [[Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary|Lewisburg Federal Prison]]. He was released from prison on November 27, 1954.\n\nWhile in prison, Hiss acted as a volunteer attorney, adviser, and tutor for many of his fellow inmates.\n\n==Post-incarceration==\nAfter his release in 1954, Hiss, who had been [[Disbarment|disbarred]], worked as a salesman for the stationery company S. Novick & Sons located in the Puck Building, 295 Lafayette St. in New York City. In 1957, he published ''In the Court of Public Opinion'',<ref>Hiss, Alger. \"''In the court of public opinion''\" 1957 Hardback, 424 pages.

Hiss separated from his first wife, Priscilla, in 1959, though they remained married until her death in 1984. In 1985 he married Isabel Johnson, who had been living with him since soon after they met in 1960.<ref>White (2005), pp. 205\u20136.</ref>\n\nOn November 11, 1962, following Richard Nixon's failed 1962 bid for governor of California, Hiss appeared in a segment titled \"The Political Obituary of Richard M.

(The ''Chicago Tribune'' reported targets of Hiss's \"invective\" and whom he \"denounced as conspirators in a monstrous plot to convict him on concocted evidence\" included: the presiding judge at his second trial, the three appellate court judges who rejected his appeal, J.

As early as December 1948 the chief investigator for the Hiss defense, Horace W. Schmahl, set off a race to find Hiss's typewriter.<ref>\n{{cite news\n | title =Sleuth \"Hired by Hiss\" Touched Off Hunt for Typewriter Here\n | work =Philadelphia Evening Bulletin\n | hdl =2027/spo.hiss1111.0182.001\n | date = December 14, 1948}}\n</ref> The FBI, with superior resources, was also searching for the typewriter, which the Hiss family had discarded some years earlier. Nevertheless, Schmahl was able to track it down first, and the Hiss defense introduced it with the intention of showing that its typeface would not be a match for that on the FBI's documents. Surprisingly, however, the typefaces proved to be an excellent match and confirmed the FBI's evidence. Schmahl subsequently changed sides and went to work for the prosecution.\n\nAfter Hiss had gone to prison, his lawyer, Chester T. Lane, acting on a tip he had received from someone who had worked with Schmahl that Hiss might have been framed, filed a motion in January 1952 for a new trial.<ref>After Hiss had been jailed, his lawyer Chester Lane received a tip that \"'Schmahl was implicated with the typewriter.' An investigator who had worked with Schmahl, Harold Bretnall, subsequently told the lawyer that Schmahl had been involved in forging the Hiss typewriter. 'Hiss', Bretnall said, 'was framed.' Schmahl, tracked down in 1973, admitted to a Hiss investigator he had been a 'consultant' on the typewriter forgery. He said the OSS had set Hiss up\u2014just when was not clear\u2014and the orders had come from through [OSS Director] [[William Joseph Donovan|Donovan]]'s law firm, Donovan, Leisure. Schmahl later retracted his statements and declined further interviews.\" (Summers (2000), p. 73).</ref> Lane sought to show that (1) forgery by typewriter was feasible and (2) such forgery had occurred in the Hiss case. Unaware that the feasibility of such forgeries had already been established throughout the War by the military intelligence services that engaged in such practices, the Hiss defense sought to establish feasibility directly by hiring a civilian typewriter expert, [[Martin Tytell]], to create a typewriter that would be indistinguishable from the one the Hisses owned. Tytell spent two years creating a facsimile Woodstock typewriter whose print characteristics would match the peculiarities of the Hiss typewriter.<ref>Squier, Michael.

According to former Woodstock executives, the production date of a machine could be inferred from the machine's serial number. The serial number on the Exhibit #UUU typewriter indicated that it would have been ''manufactured'' after the man who sold the Hiss machine had retired from the company and the salesman insisted that he did not sell any typewriters after his retirement. Decades later, when FBI files were disclosed under the Freedom of Information Act, it turned out that the FBI had also doubted that the trial exhibit was Hiss's machine and for exactly the same reasons; although the FBI expressed these concerns internally as the first trial was about to begin, the public did not learn about the FBI's doubts until the mid-1970s.<ref>\n{{cite news\n | author =John Lowenthal\n | title =What the FBI knew and hid\n | work =The Nation\n | url =http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/lowenthaltyp.html\n | date = June 26, 1976\n | accessdate = July 12, 2010\n }}\n</ref>\n\nTo explain why typing from Exhibit #UUU seemed indistinguishable from the typing on Hiss's old machine, Lane assembled experts prepared to testify that Exhibit #UUU had been tampered with in a way inconsistent with professional repair work to make it type like Hiss's old typewriter.

During World War II, Field, who never concealed he was a communist, headed a Unitarian Services organization to aid displaced persons in Marseilles, before fleeing to Geneva, where he collaborated with Allen Dulles of the OSS (who was based in Bern). In 1948, when the Hiss trials started, Field and his German wife were still living in Switzerland. By 1949 Field was broke, having been fired from the U.S.-based Unitarian Service Committee for his communist associations. Wishing to avoid returning to the United States and possibly having to testify before Congress, Field traveled to [[Prague]], hoping to be hired as a lecturer at the [[Charles University in Prague|Charles University]].<ref>Field lacked confidence he could stand up under testimony: \"Alger defended himself ... with great intelligence. He had been trained as a lawyer and knew all the phrases and tricks. I, on the other hand, had no such experience....

I was indiscreet enough to tell him he had come too late.\" This agreed with [[Hede Massing]]'s assertion to US authorities in 1947 that when she attempted to recruit Noel Field for one Soviet spy network (the [[OGPU]]), Field had replied that he already worked for another (the [[Glavnoye Razvedyvatel'noye Upravleniye|GRU]]). (Massing repeated this story at Hiss's second trial when she testified that at a party at Noel Field's house in 1935 she had obliquely joked with Hiss about recruiting Noel Field.<ref>[http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/hedem.html ''The Alger Hiss Story: The Cast: Hede Massing''].

According to Soviet sources, however, \"Doctor\" was a middle-aged Bessarabian Jew who was educated in Vienna.<ref>Kisseloff (2009).</ref>\n\nOther historians {{failed verification|date=August 2013}} felt that Haynes and Klehr's information was suspect because their publisher, Crown (a division of Random House), obtained temporary and limited access to KGB files through a payment of money (amount unspecified) to a pension fund for retired KGB agents, of whom Vassiliev was one, as was KGB archivist Volkogonov.<ref>\"Just a year after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the intelligence services responded to an offer from Crown Publishers, which offered a substantial payment to a pension fund for its retired officers in return for cooperation on a series of books on Soviet intelligence. As part of the agreement the SVR gave Alexander Vassiliev permission to examine archival records for a book project that teamed a Russian (Vassiliev) and an American (Allen Weinstein) for a book on Soviet espionage in the 1930s and 40s\", Haynes, Klehr, and Vassiliev (2009), p. xxii.</ref> Other historians had not been permitted to verify Vassiliev's data. In 2002, Vassiliev sued John Lowenthal for libel in a British court of law for publishing a journal article questioning his conclusions. Vassiliev lost the case before a jury and was further reprimanded by ''[[The Times]]'' for trying to exert a \"chilling effect\" on scholarship by resorting to the law courts.<ref>Judge Eady also issued a [http://homepages.nyu.edu/~th15/lowenthalruling.html separate opinion] in which he stated that the book by Haynes, et al., by asserting that the Hiss case was definitively \"settled\", had in effect \"thrown down a gauntlet\" to any would-be defender of Hiss; and that family, friends, or any other defender of Hiss should not be penalized for \"picking up that gauntlet\".</ref> Vassiliev has since also unsuccessfully sued Amazon.com for publishing a customer review critical of his work.<ref>Charles Arthur, \"Former KGB Agent Sues Amazon Over Book Review\" [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/former-kgb-agent-sues-amazon-over-book-review-537930.html ''The Independent'', UK (May 3, 2003)].</ref> In 1978, Victor Navasky interviewed six people Weinstein had quoted in his book ''Perjury'', who all claimed to have been misquoted by Weinstein.<ref>[http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/5062.html Jon Wiener, \"Allen Weinstein, Historian With a History\", ''Los Angeles Times''], May 2, 2004, reprinted in the HNN.</ref> One, Sam Krieger, won a cash payment from Weinstein, who issued an apology and promised to correct future editions of his book and to release his interview transcripts, which he subsequently failed to do.<ref>See [https://books.google.com/books?id=8uACAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61 \"Costly Error for Hiss Historian: Weinstein Pays for Mistake\", ''New York Magazine'' (May 21, 1979), 61].

After graduating from [[Juntendo University]], he joined [[Gamba Osaka]] in 1995. He became a regular player from 1996. However his opportunity to play decreased in 2001 and he moved to [[Hokkaido Consadole Sapporo|Consadole Sapporo]] in July 2001. Although he played as regular player, the club was relegated to [[J2 League]] from 2003. In 2004, he moved to [[J\u00fabilo Iwata]], but he could hardly play in matches and he retired at the end of the 2005 season.\n\n==Coaching career==\nAfter retirement, Morishita started coaching at [[J\u00fabilo Iwata]] in 2006. He coached the youth team from 2006 to 2007 and the top team from 2008 to 2011. In 2012, he became the manager of the club, but due to bad club results, he was sacked in May 2013 when the club was at 17th place out of 18 clubs.
