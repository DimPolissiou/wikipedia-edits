It was released on 16 January 1989 under the label of [[Virgin Records]]. The album has a more subdued tone than the prominent bombast of its predecessor, ''[[Broadcast (Cutting Crew album)|Broadcast]]''. Despite spawning the US Adult Contemporary No. 4 chart hit \"Everything But My Pride\", and mostly positive fanfare from critics upon retrospect, it was met with little commercial or critical success at the time of its release.\n\n== Background ==\nFollowing the band's platinum-selling debut album ''Broadcast'' in 1986, buoyed by the success of the massive No. 1 US hit \"[[(I Just) Died in Your Arms]]\" ,the top 10 hit, \"[[I've Been in Love Before (song)|I've Been in Love Before]]\", and another Top 40 song, \"One For the Mockingbird\", the success of ''Broadcast'' was timid by comparison. Executives of Virgin Records were keen on the band delivering an album that both was popular on its own and had radio-friendly singles line up. \n\nIt was recorded mostly at Curtis Schwartz' Studio in Sussex, England, in 1988, the second-ever album ever to be recorded at the studio<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/label/368398-Curtis-Schwartz-Studio|title=Curtis Schwartz Studio|website=Discogs|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>. It was set to be released the same year, however, its release was delayed by a year due to seemingly managerial disputes<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707072650/http://cherryred.co.uk/cherrypop/product.php?display=cuttingcrew|title=Cherry Pop Records : Cutting Crew|date=2010-07-07|website=web.archive.org|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>; by the time it finally launched in early 1989, the landscape of pop music was undergoing great change as the influence of [[grunge]] was taking over. Three years after ''Broadcast'' had come and gone, most fans had moved on, and the album sold poorly with no hit singles.\n\n== Songs ==\nWhen asked during a December 2008 interview about his favorite track by Cutting Crew, vocalist [[Nick Van Eede]] spoke fondly of the album's title track, stating, \n\n\"'''The Scattering''.' I think it's one of my best lyrics, telling of how the small villages in rural communities can die out when the life blood youth move away to the big cities. We had a lot of fun recording it as we flew down from Scotland with The Whistle Binkies who were a fabulous and famous folk band. We had 5 hours to record all their parts which included Bodhran, fiddle, pipes and accordion. This is still a firm favourite when we play live, even without the folk band!\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/nick-van-eede-from-cutting-crew|title=Nick Van Eede from Cutting Crew : Songwriter Interviews|last=Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn a different interview, Van Eede talked about his frustrations with the continuous delaying of the album before its release, stating the song \"(Between A) Rock and a Hard Place\" had lyrics pertaining to the scenario. \n\n\u201cWe wrote one slightly veiled song having a pop at US A&R antics in our 'Between a Rock and Hard Place' from ''The Scattering'' album.

The late release of the album is often blamed as the primary reason for the band's stalling momentum and popularity. Michael Sutton of [[AllMusic]] wrote of the album, \"...while ''The Scattering'' doesn't have ear candy like the band's hit singles, the music is less-blatantly commercial and more personal. It's still slick stuff -- big '80s synthesizers, glossy FM radio guitars, in-your-face drums -- but Nick Van Eede's vocals have a frosty glow that creates a mood and sustains interest.\" He ends his review, with the anecdote, \"''The Scattering'' will probably seem dated to anyone who isn't an '80s enthusiast, but it's tasty nostalgia for people who remember the decade fondly. Cutting Crew were obviously infatuated with the arena-sized riffs of [[U2]] and [[Big Country]], and while the group doesn't reach those bands' creative heights, hook-packed material such as 'Everything but My Pride' and 'Tip of Your Tongue' finds them walking tall.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/album/the-scattering-mw0000199452|title=The Scattering - Cutting Crew {{!}} Songs, Reviews, Credits|website=AllMusic|language=en-us|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1 = AllMusic\n| rev1score = 6/10\n}}\n\n==== Aftermath ====\nAlthough now regarded in a slightly more positive light, ''The Scattering'' was quick to languish in obscurity, peaking at a mere No. 150 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Its singles, too, failed to leave a lasting impact going into the 1990s. Dissuaded by the commercial under-performance of the album and its singles, bassist Colin Farley and drummer [[Frosty Beedle|Martin Beedle]] left the band. Undeterred, Nick Van Eede and fellow guitarist and bandmate [[Kevin MacMichael|Kevin Macmichael]] pressed on, delivering one final Cutting Crew effort in October 1992, ''Compus Mentus''. Once again, the album flopped, and Cutting Crew disbanded in 1993. \n\nAfter the death of Macmichael in 2002, Van Eede would reform Cutting Crew under a different lineup. He is still releasing new Cutting Crew material, being the sole remaining member of the original band.\n\n== Track Listing ==\n{{Track listing\n| all_writing = Nick Van Eede and Kevin Macmichael, except where noted\n| title9 = The Last Thing\n| writer12 = Eede\n| writer10 = Farley\n| writer8 = Eede, Macmichael, Colin Farley\n| writer7 = Eede, Macmichael, Martin Beedle\n| writer5 = Macmichael\n| length12 = 6:05\n| title12 = Brag\n| length11 = 1:31\n| title11 = Binkies Return (Instrumental)\n| total_length = 52:00\n| length10 = 5:35\n| title10 = Feel the Wedge\n| length9 = 3:57\n| length8 = 5:04\n| title1 = Year in the Wilderness\n| title8 = Reach For The Sky\n| length7 = 3:36\n| title7 = Tip of Your Tongue\n| length6 = 4:17\n| title6 = (Between A) Rock And A Hard Place\n| length5 = 3:43\n| title5 = Handcuffs For Houdini\n| length4 = 5:10\n| title4 = Everything But My Pride\n| length3 = 4:00\n| title3 = Big Noise\n| length2 = 5:01\n| title2 = The Scattering\n| length1 = 4:44\n| writer1 = Eede, Macmichael, Tony Moore\n}}\n\n== Personnel ==\n\n=== Cutting Crew ===\n\n* [[Nick Van Eede]] -

It is programmed by its in-house production studio, [[Williams Street]]. It currently broadcasts nightly from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]. The block is marketed as a separate network from Cartoon Network for ratings purposes, similar to [[Nickelodeon]] On Thursday-Saturday. the nighttime branding of [[Nick at Nite|Nick At Nite]].\n\nDebuting in 2001, Adult Swim serves as the nighttime identity of Cartoon Network, and was established as alternative programming during the late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience, children between the ages of 7 and 15, would normally be sleeping. In 2005, the block was granted its own [[Nielsen ratings]] report from Cartoon Network due to targeting a separate demographic. The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action shows; including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series, [[anime]], [[original video animation]], and [[short film]]s with generally minimal or no editing for content.\n\nThe block has frequently aired [[adult animation]] features, [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]], [[sketch comedy]], and [[Television pilot|pilots]]. The block's shows are known for their sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. Many of its programs are aesthetically [[experimental]], transgressive, improvised, and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] in nature. This has become a source of conflict, with some saying that Adult Swim is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in [[absurdity|absurd]] and [[shock value|shock]] comedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|title=Thinking small|website=Channelweb.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105222547/http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs with Cartoon Network, Adult Swim's reach through various services totals 94 million American households.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable network coverage area household universe estimates: January 2016 \u2013 Broadcasting & Cable|website=Broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=November 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202182549/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|archive-date=December 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Creation and development ===\n{{See also|Space Ghost Coast to Coast}}\n[[Cartoon Network]]'s original head programmer, [[Mike Lazzo]], conceived<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs \u2013 Fred Seibert's Blog \u2013 Dinner at [adult swim].|website=Archives.frederatorblogs.com|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630142003/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Adult Swim. The block grew out of Cartoon Network's previous attempts at airing content appropriate for teenagers and young adults who might be watching the channel after 11 pm (ET/PT). The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows that presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts, such as ''[[ToonHeads]]'', ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]'', ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[Late Night Black and White]]'', and ''[[O Canada (TV series)|O Canada]]''. Another block, [[Toonami]]'s \"Midnight Run\", aired the network's action programming uncut with minimal edits.

That was followed by the ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' episode [[List of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! episodes|\"Tommy\"]], which featured the star and director of the film [[Tommy Wiseau]].\n* In 2010, Adult Swim re-aired ''The Room'' for a second year in a row, with bumps featuring [[Tommy Wiseau]] being interviewed on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''. Sex scenes remained censored, but the [[TV Parental Guidelines|parental rating]] was raised to TV-MA.\n* In 2011, ''The Room'' was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled ''Earth Ghost'', a CGI version of the ''Lowe Country'' pilot shown on [[Adult Swim Video]] in 2007.\n* In 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with [[Toonami]], a former programming block from [[Cartoon Network]]. After first playing the opening sequence of ''The Room'', the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools' Day before introducing that week's scheduled episode of ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]''. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!

T.O.M. also presented a review of ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured.

The episode \"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]\" aired repeatedly from 8pm until midnight on TV (shortening [[Toonami]] in the process and pre-empting premieres of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''), and was also streaming on a loop on the adultswim.com streams all night. The bumps included new commissioned idents related to ''Rick and Morty'' and announcement promos of upcoming shows and seasons.\n* On March 31, 2018, Toonami premiered the first episode of ''[[FLCL|FLCL Alternative]]'', the show's third season (even as the second season had not been aired yet), albeit in Japanese with English subtitles, breaking Toonami's policy of only playing dubbed anime. Following ''FLCL'', the 2004 film ''[[Mind Game (film)|Mind Game]]'', directed by [[Masaaki Yuasa]], was played. Most of Toonami's scheduled programming for that night (featuring ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders]], [[Hunter \u00d7 Hunter]], [[Naruto: Shippuden (season 10)|Naruto: Shippuden]], [[Space Dandy]], [[Cowboy Bebop]] & [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG]]'') were pushed back to 2:45&nbsp;a.m. after the film, and aired subbed instead of dubbed. The short ''Scavengers'' finished off the block at 5:45&nbsp;a.m. The block aired special bumpers with T.O.M. and S.A.R.A. and a game review of ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', all dubbed to Japanese with English subtitles and pink colors instead of the usual green. The Adult Swim logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as [\u30a2\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30e0]), affecting both bumps and the channel bug. Block runner Jason DeMarco confirmed on Twitter that all original scheduled programming that was affected by the English subtitled joke after ''Mind Game'' would air the same episode dubbed the following week.\n* On April 1, 2018, in yet another rare double prank, Adult Swim aired normally until 11:00&nbsp;p.m., when it started airing an animated parody of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' titled \"Bushworld Adventures\", created by Michael R. Cusack.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adult Swim|title=Bushworld Adventures {{!}} Adult Swim|date=2018-04-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|accessdate=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406054404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It follows Rick and Morty in [[Australia]] going on wild adventures in search to find the green cube that was left at Bendigo. It looped three more times until midnight, pre-empting ''Rick and Morty'' and two ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]'' reruns in the process. All of Adult Swim's nature-themed bumpers that aired throughout the hour were Australian-themed. This special short was also simulcasted on a loop in a marathon stream on adultswim.com all night.\n* In 2019, regular programming was replaced, beginning at midnight, with the debut of ''[[G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu]]'', an anime parody that aired until 5:45am, when an episode of ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'' played as a buffer between it and Cartoon Network's sign-on at 6am. It was simulcast both on TV and on Adult Swim's online live stream. It additionally served as the premiere series for the new 24/7 [[Adult Swim (Canada)|Adult Swim]] network in [[Canada]].\n* In 2020, regular programming was replaced again. The intro for a second season of ''G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu'' was played, but it would be interrupted by [[Post Malone]], who would host several bumpers (along with [[Swae Lee]] later on in the block) introducing stealth premieres of new seasons of ''[[Primal (TV series)|Primal]]'', ''[[Dream Corp, LLC]]'', ''[[Tigtone]]'', ''[[The Shivering Truth]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Lazor Wulf]]'', ''[[12 oz. Mouse]]'', and ''[[Tender Touches]]''. The stealth premiere block also showcased pilots of new shows ''YOLO: Crystal Fantasy'', ''JJ Villard's Fairy Tales'' and ''Smiling Friends''. Malone would also make silent cameos on said shows via green screen.<ref>https://comicbook.com/anime/2020/04/01/adult-swim-april-fools-day-primal-new-episodes-reaction/</ref>\n\n=== Alternate reality games ===\n[[File:Adult Swim ARG first transmission from Delilah Aug 2017.png|thumb|right|alt=A black screen with the text \"Hello my name is D.E.L.I.L.A.H.\"|Image from part of the ARG transmission that aired on August 27, 2017.

This new account informed everyone that they were searching for their missing sister named Amelia. The bump transmissions then started referring viewers to this new Twitter account as well as several new [[Instagram]] accounts, continuing to provide puzzles that required solving. Some players have used [[Discord (software)|Discord]] to work together as a team in a dedicated server to solve the puzzles and share theories about the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discord.gg/HtGAT5T|title=Discord \u2013 Free voice and text chat for gamers|website=Discord|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> The ARG has been consistently broadcasting new messages and puzzles every Sunday since the initial August 2017 broadcast, with only a short hiatus during the 2017 holiday break. On March 25, 2018 it was revealed that Amelia was safe and had been for quite some time. Players learned that Amelia's messages asking for help were actually sent 3 years prior and that their delay in being received was caused by [[time dilation]]. This revelation effectively completed the second chapter of the ARG, it also alluded to the next phase which has just started as of June 2018.\n\n== Programming ==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim|List of programs broadcast by Toonami}}\nOriginal shows currently in-production and seen on Adult Swim include ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', ''[[Black Jesus (TV series)|Black Jesus]]'', ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', and ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]''. Adult Swim is best known for its inaugural slate of programming, which were parodies and remakes based on [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons (including ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' and ''[[Sealab 2021]]'').\n\nAdult Swim also airs [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs acquired from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] (such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''), original series produced for sister network [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] (''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Final Space]]''), and acquired and co-produced [[anime]] series. Adult Swim is currently one of the only networks in the United States that airs anime (besides [[Disney XD]]) and the only network that airs such programming aimed at young adults and teens rather than children.\n\nCurrently, anime and most [[Action film|action]]-genre programming air every Saturday night as part of [[Toonami]], a former Cartoon Network programming block that was relaunched as part of Adult Swim on May 26, 2012 as a \"block-within-a-block\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Cartoon Network shows that have gained a following among older viewers have also aired on Toonami; in particular, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' proved popular enough in reruns to warrant a [[Samurai Jack (season 5)|revival]] in 2017.

In June 2010, they began delaying episode availability on Adult Swim Video by one week after original television broadcast. Previously, episodes had appeared 1\u20133 days after broadcast.

Currently apps are available in the [[United States|U.S. only]] for the [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (including [[Android TV]]), [[Apple TV]], [[iOS]], [[Chromecast]], [[Roku]] and [[Xbox One]]. Due to licensing agreements certain parts of the apps including access to the live stream and past shows require the viewer to use their subscription-television provider or OTT-platform username and password to authenticate their right to access such content. A downside to these apps is the fact that, unlike free-to-air television, they are not currently compliant with U.S. [[Closed captioning]] requirements.\n\n== International ==\n[[File:Mapa Adult Swim.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=World map with the United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Russia, Tasmania, and New Zealand highlighted.|Adult Swim's international channel availability.]]\nAdult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005.

It is programmed by its in-house production studio, [[Williams Street]]. It currently broadcasts nightly from 8 p.m. to 6 a.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]]/[[Pacific Time Zone|PT]]. The block is marketed as a separate network from Cartoon Network for ratings purposes, similar to [[Nickelodeon]] On Thursday-Saturday. the nighttime branding of [[Nick at Nite|Nick At Nite]].\n\nDebuting in 2001, Adult Swim serves as the nighttime identity of Cartoon Network, and was established as alternative programming during the late night hours when Cartoon Network's primary target audience, children between the ages of 7 and 15, would normally be sleeping. In 2005, the block was granted its own [[Nielsen ratings]] report from Cartoon Network due to targeting a separate demographic. The block features stylistically varied animated and live-action shows; including original programming, [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] series, [[anime]], [[original video animation]], and [[short film]]s with generally minimal or no editing for content.\n\nThe block has frequently aired [[adult animation]] features, [[Mockumentary|mockumentaries]], [[sketch comedy]], and [[Television pilot|pilots]]. The block's shows are known for their sexual themes, frank sexual discussion, nudity, strong language, and graphic violence. Many of its programs are aesthetically [[experimental]], transgressive, improvised, and [[Surrealism|surrealist]] in nature. This has become a source of conflict, with some saying that Adult Swim is too controversial, while others noting that its ability to question the norm brings a level of surrealism and experimentalism that is welcome. Adult Swim has contracted with various studios known for their productions in [[absurdity|absurd]] and [[shock value|shock]] comedy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|title=Thinking small|website=Channelweb.co.uk|accessdate=25 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105222547/http://www.channelweb.co.uk/crn-uk/feature/2122353/thinking|archive-date=January 5, 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nAs with Cartoon Network, Adult Swim's reach through various services totals 94 million American households.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|title=Cable network coverage area household universe estimates: January 2016 \u2013 Broadcasting & Cable|website=Broadcastingcable.com|accessdate=November 25, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171202182549/http://www.broadcastingcable.com/content/cable-network-coverage-area-household-universe-estimates-january-2016/153590|archive-date=December 2, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n=== Creation and development ===\n{{See also|Space Ghost Coast to Coast}}\n[[Cartoon Network]]'s original head programmer, [[Mike Lazzo]], conceived<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|title=Frederator Studios Blogs \u2013 Fred Seibert's Blog \u2013 Dinner at [adult swim].|website=Archives.frederatorblogs.com|accessdate=June 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150630142003/http://archives.frederatorblogs.com/frederator_studios/2007/09/12/dinner-at-adult-swim/|archive-date=June 30, 2015|url-status=live}}</ref> Adult Swim. The block grew out of Cartoon Network's previous attempts at airing content appropriate for teenagers and young adults who might be watching the channel after 11 pm (ET/PT). The network began experimenting with its late night programming by airing anthology shows that presented uncensored classic cartoon shorts, such as ''[[ToonHeads]]'', ''[[The Bob Clampett Show]]'', ''[[The Tex Avery Show]]'', ''[[Late Night Black and White]]'', and ''[[O Canada (TV series)|O Canada]]''. Another block, [[Toonami]]'s \"Midnight Run\", aired the network's action programming uncut with minimal edits.

That was followed by the ''[[Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job!]]'' episode [[List of Tim and Eric Awesome Show, Great Job! episodes|\"Tommy\"]], which featured the star and director of the film [[Tommy Wiseau]].\n* In 2010, Adult Swim re-aired ''The Room'' for a second year in a row, with bumps featuring [[Tommy Wiseau]] being interviewed on ''Space Ghost Coast to Coast''. Sex scenes remained censored, but the [[TV Parental Guidelines|parental rating]] was raised to TV-MA.\n* In 2011, ''The Room'' was aired once again with the TV-MA rating and was followed by a 15-minute special titled ''Earth Ghost'', a CGI version of the ''Lowe Country'' pilot shown on [[Adult Swim Video]] in 2007.\n* In 2012, Adult Swim replaced its lineup with [[Toonami]], a former programming block from [[Cartoon Network]]. After first playing the opening sequence of ''The Room'', the scene switched to the Toonami host T.O.M. noting that it was April Fools' Day before introducing that week's scheduled episode of ''[[Bleach (TV series)|Bleach]]''. The Toonami bumps and programming would continue throughout the night, featuring ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]'', ''[[Mobile Suit Gundam Wing]]'', ''[[Tenchi Muyo!

T.O.M. also presented a review of ''[[Mass Effect 3]]'' and promoted the recent DVD releases of the series featured.

The episode \"[[The Rickshank Rickdemption]]\" aired repeatedly from 8pm until midnight on TV (shortening [[Toonami]] in the process and pre-empting premieres of ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' and ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''), and was also streaming on a loop on the adultswim.com streams all night. The bumps included new commissioned idents related to ''Rick and Morty'' and announcement promos of upcoming shows and seasons.\n* On March 31, 2018, Toonami premiered the first episode of ''[[FLCL|FLCL Alternative]]'', the show's third season (even as the second season had not been aired yet), albeit in Japanese with English subtitles, breaking Toonami's policy of only playing dubbed anime. Following ''FLCL'', the 2004 film ''[[Mind Game (film)|Mind Game]]'', directed by [[Masaaki Yuasa]], was played. Most of Toonami's scheduled programming for that night (featuring ''[[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Stardust Crusaders]], [[Hunter \u00d7 Hunter]], [[Naruto: Shippuden (season 10)|Naruto: Shippuden]], [[Space Dandy]], [[Cowboy Bebop]] & [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex|Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex 2nd GIG]]'') were pushed back to 2:45&nbsp;a.m. after the film, and aired subbed instead of dubbed. The short ''Scavengers'' finished off the block at 5:45&nbsp;a.m. The block aired special bumpers with T.O.M. and S.A.R.A. and a game review of ''[[Nier: Automata]]'', all dubbed to Japanese with English subtitles and pink colors instead of the usual green. The Adult Swim logo was also changed to Japanese (stylized as [\u30a2\u30c0\u30eb\u30c8\u30b9\u30a4\u30e0]), affecting both bumps and the channel bug. Block runner Jason DeMarco confirmed on Twitter that all original scheduled programming that was affected by the English subtitled joke after ''Mind Game'' would air the same episode dubbed the following week.\n* On April 1, 2018, in yet another rare double prank, Adult Swim aired normally until 11:00&nbsp;p.m., when it started airing an animated parody of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'' titled \"Bushworld Adventures\", created by Michael R. Cusack.<ref>{{Citation|last=Adult Swim|title=Bushworld Adventures {{!}} Adult Swim|date=2018-04-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|accessdate=2018-04-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180406054404/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v6yg4ImnYwA|archive-date=April 6, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref> It follows Rick and Morty in [[Australia]] going on wild adventures in search to find the green cube that was left at Bendigo. It looped three more times until midnight, pre-empting ''Rick and Morty'' and two ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]'' reruns in the process. All of Adult Swim's nature-themed bumpers that aired throughout the hour were Australian-themed. This special short was also simulcasted on a loop in a marathon stream on adultswim.com all night.\n* In 2019, regular programming was replaced, beginning at midnight, with the debut of ''[[G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu]]'', an anime parody that aired until 5:45am, when an episode of ''[[Off the Air (TV series)|Off the Air]]'' played as a buffer between it and Cartoon Network's sign-on at 6am. It was simulcast both on TV and on Adult Swim's online live stream. It additionally served as the premiere series for the new 24/7 [[Adult Swim (Canada)|Adult Swim]] network in [[Canada]].\n* In 2020, regular programming was replaced again. The intro for a second season of ''G\u0113musetto Machu Picchu'' was played, but it would be interrupted by [[Post Malone]], who would host several bumpers (along with [[Swae Lee]] later on in the block) introducing stealth premieres of new seasons of ''[[Primal (TV series)|Primal]]'', ''[[Dream Corp, LLC]]'', ''[[Tigtone]]'', ''[[The Shivering Truth]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Lazor Wulf]]'', ''[[12 oz. Mouse]]'' and ''[[Tender Touches]]''. The stealth premiere block also showcased pilots of new shows ''YOLO: Crystal Fantasy'', ''JJ Villard's Fairy Tales'' and ''Smiling Friends''. Malone would also make silent cameos on said shows via green screen.<ref>https://comicbook.com/anime/2020/04/01/adult-swim-april-fools-day-primal-new-episodes-reaction/</ref>\n\n=== Alternate reality games ===\n[[File:Adult Swim ARG first transmission from Delilah Aug 2017.png|thumb|right|alt=A black screen with the text \"Hello my name is D.E.L.I.L.A.H.\"|Image from part of the ARG transmission that aired on August 27, 2017.

This new account informed everyone that they were searching for their missing sister named Amelia. The bump transmissions then started referring viewers to this new Twitter account as well as several new [[Instagram]] accounts, continuing to provide puzzles that required solving. Some players have used [[Discord (software)|Discord]] to work together as a team in a dedicated server to solve the puzzles and share theories about the game.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://discord.gg/HtGAT5T|title=Discord \u2013 Free voice and text chat for gamers|website=Discord|access-date=2018-03-10}}</ref> The ARG has been consistently broadcasting new messages and puzzles every Sunday since the initial August 2017 broadcast, with only a short hiatus during the 2017 holiday break. On March 25, 2018 it was revealed that Amelia was safe and had been for quite some time. Players learned that Amelia's messages asking for help were actually sent 3 years prior and that their delay in being received was caused by [[time dilation]]. This revelation effectively completed the second chapter of the ARG, it also alluded to the next phase which has just started as of June 2018.\n\n== Programming ==\n{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Adult Swim|List of programs broadcast by Toonami}}\nOriginal shows currently in-production and seen on Adult Swim include ''[[The Venture Bros.]]'', ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', ''[[Squidbillies]]'', ''[[Black Jesus (TV series)|Black Jesus]]'', ''[[The Eric Andre Show]]'', ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', and ''[[Mike Tyson Mysteries]]''. Adult Swim is best known for its inaugural slate of programming, which were parodies and remakes based on [[Hanna-Barbera]] cartoons (including ''[[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]]'', ''[[Harvey Birdman, Attorney at Law]]'' and ''[[Sealab 2021]]'').\n\nAdult Swim also airs [[broadcast syndication|syndicated]] programs acquired from [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]] (such as ''[[Family Guy]]'', and ''[[Bob's Burgers]]''), original series produced for sister network [[TBS (American TV channel)|TBS]] (''[[American Dad!]]'' and ''[[Final Space]]''), and acquired and co-produced [[anime]] series. Adult Swim is currently one of the only networks in the United States that airs anime (besides [[Disney XD]]) and the only network that airs such programming aimed at young adults and teens rather than children.\n\nCurrently, anime and most [[Action film|action]]-genre programming air every Saturday night as part of [[Toonami]], a former Cartoon Network programming block that was relaunched as part of Adult Swim on May 26, 2012 as a \"block-within-a-block\".<ref name=\":2\" /> Cartoon Network shows that have gained a following among older viewers have also aired on Toonami; in particular, ''[[Samurai Jack]]'' proved popular enough in reruns to warrant a [[Samurai Jack (season 5)|revival]] in 2017.

In June 2010, they began delaying episode availability on Adult Swim Video by one week after original television broadcast. Previously, episodes had appeared 1\u20133 days after broadcast.

Currently apps are available in the [[United States|U.S. only]] for the [[Amazon Fire TV]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]] (including [[Android TV]]), [[Apple TV]], [[iOS]], [[Chromecast]], [[Roku]] and [[Xbox One]]. Due to licensing agreements certain parts of the apps including access to the live stream and past shows require the viewer to use their subscription-television provider or OTT-platform username and password to authenticate their right to access such content. A downside to these apps is the fact that, unlike free-to-air television, they are not currently compliant with U.S. [[Closed captioning]] requirements.\n\n== International ==\n[[File:Mapa Adult Swim.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=World map with the United States, Canada, Brazil, Ireland, Northern Ireland, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Liechtenstein, Russia, Tasmania, and New Zealand highlighted.|Adult Swim's international channel availability.]]\nAdult Swim has been actively expanding its reach across the world since 2005.

{"title_page": "Keyboard technology", "text_new": "{{short description|Technology of keyboards}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{lead too short|date=January 2015}}\n{{original research|date=January 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Keyboard Construction.JPG|right|thumb| Keyboard construction, in four layers, of a typical notebook computer keyboard]]\n[[Computer keyboard]]s can be classified by the [[switch]] technology that they use. Computer alphanumeric keyboards typically have 80 to 110 durable switches, generally one for each key. The choice of switch technology affects key response (the positive feedback that a key has been pressed) and pre travel (the distance needed to push the key to enter a character reliably). Newer keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve greater cost savings.\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Membrane keyboard ===\n{{main|Membrane keyboard}}\nThere are two types of membrane-based keyboards, flat-panel membrane keyboards and full-travel membrane keyboards:\n\nFlat-panel membrane keyboards are most often found on appliances like [[microwave oven]]s or [[photocopier]]s. A common design consists of three layers. The top layer has the labels printed on its front and conductive stripes printed on the back. Under this it has a spacer layer, which holds the front and back layer apart so that they do not normally make electrical contact. The back layer has conductive stripes printed perpendicularly to those of the front layer. When placed together, the stripes form a grid. When the user pushes down at a particular position, their finger pushes the front layer down through the spacer layer to close a circuit at one of the intersections of the grid. This indicates to the computer or keyboard control processor that a particular button has been pressed.\n\nGenerally, flat-panel membrane keyboards do not produce a noticeable physical feedback. Therefore, devices using these issue a beep or flash a light when the key is pressed. They are often used in harsh environments where water- or leak-proofing is desirable. Although used in the early days of the [[personal computer]] (on the [[Sinclair ZX80]], [[Sinclair ZX81|ZX81]] and [[Atari 400]]), they have been supplanted by the more tactile dome and mechanical switch keyboards.\n\nFull-travel membrane-based keyboards are the most common computer keyboards today. They have one-piece plastic keytop/switch plungers which press down on a membrane to actuate a contact in an electrical switch matrix.\n\n=== Dome-switch keyboard ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Computer keyboard]] -->\n[[File:Keyboard Construction Button Press.JPG|right|thumb|How a dome-switch keyboard works: Finger depresses the dome to complete the circuit]]\n[[File:Membrane keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|Dome switches mesh with keys (keyboard is upside down in this image)]]\n{{see also|Chiclet keyboard}}\nDome-switch keyboards are a hybrid of [[Membrane keyboard|flat-panel membrane]] and mechanical-switch keyboards. They bring two circuit board traces together under a [[rubber]] or silicone keypad using either metal \"dome\" switches or polyurethane formed domes. The metal dome switches are formed pieces of stainless steel that, when compressed, give the user a crisp, positive tactile feedback. These metal types of dome switches are very common, are usually reliable to over 5 million cycles, and can be plated in either nickel, silver or gold. The rubber dome switches, most commonly referred to as polydomes, are formed polyurethane domes where the inside bubble is coated in graphite. While polydomes are typically cheaper than metal domes, they lack the crisp snap of the metal domes, and usually have a lower life specification. Polydomes are considered very quiet, but purists tend to find them \"mushy\" because the collapsing dome does not provide as much positive response as metal domes. For either metal or polydomes, when a key is pressed, it collapses the dome, which connects the two circuit traces and completes the connection to enter the character. The pattern on the PC board is often gold-plated.\n\nBoth are common switch technologies used in mass market keyboards today. This type of switch technology happens to be most commonly used in handheld controllers, mobile phones, automotive, consumer electronics and medical devices. Dome-switch keyboards are also called direct-switch keyboards.\n\n=== Scissor-switch keyboard ===\n[[File:Scissor switch mechanism.svg|thumb|left|Scissor switch mechanism]]\nA special case of the computer keyboard dome-switch is the scissor-switch. The keys are attached to the keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in a \"scissor\"-like fashion, and snap to the keyboard and the key. It still uses rubber domes, but a special plastic [[scissors mechanism| 'scissors' mechanism]] links the [[keycap]] to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome with a much shorter travel than the typical rubber dome keyboard. Typically scissor-switch keyboards also employ 3-layer membranes as the electrical component of the switch. They also usually have a shorter total key travel distance (2&nbsp;mm instead of 3.5 \u2013 4&nbsp;mm for standard dome-switch keyswitches). This type of keyswitch is often found on the built-in keyboards on laptops and keyboards marketed as 'low-profile'. These keyboards are generally quiet and the keys require little force to press.\n\nScissor-switch keyboards are typically slightly more expensive. They are harder to clean (due to the limited movement of the keys and their multiple attachment points) but also less likely to get debris in them as the gaps between the keys are often smaller (as there is no need for extra room to allow for the 'wiggle' in the key, as typically found on a membrane keyboard).<ref>{{Citation | title = Keyboards | contribution = Mechanical vs membrane keyswitches | publisher = Ergo | place = [[Canada |CA]] | contribution-url = http://www.ergocanada.ca/ergo/keyboards/mechanical_vs_membrane_keyswitches.html}}.</ref>\n\n=== Capacitive keyboard ===\nIn this type of keyboard, pressing a key changes the capacitance of a pattern of capacitor pads. The pattern consists of two D-shaped capacitor pads for each switch, printed on a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and covered by a thin, insulating film of [[soldermask]] which acts as a [[dielectric]].\n\nDespite the sophistication of the concept, the mechanism of capacitive switching is physically simple. The movable part ends with a flat foam element about the size of an [[Tablet (pharmacy)|aspirin tablet]], finished with aluminum foil. Opposite the switch is a PCB with the capacitor pads. When the key is pressed, the foil tightly clings to the surface of the PCB, forming a [[series circuits|daisy chain]] of two capacitors between [[contact pad]]s and itself separated with thin soldermask, and thus \"shorting\" the [[contact pad]]s with an easily detectable drop of [[capacitive reactance]] between them. Usually this permits a pulse or pulse train to be sensed. Because the switch doesn't have an actual electrical contact, there is no debouncing necessary. The keys do not need to be fully pressed to be actuated, which enables some people to type faster. The sensor tells enough about the position of the key to allow the user to adjust actuation point (key sensitivity). This adjustment can be done with the help of the bundled software and individually for each key, if so implemented. <ref>Topre keyboard documentation, describing various features [http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/products/R2SA-US4-IV/index.html] and they software manual [http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/support/download/REALFORCE_Software_Manual_EN.pdf pdf]</ref>\n\nThe IBM [[Model F keyboard]] is mechanical-key design consisted of a buckling spring over a capacitive PCB, similarly to the later Model M keyboard that used a membrane in place of the PCB. \n\nThe most known company for their capacitive (electrostatic) switching technology is Topre Corporation<ref>[http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/ Topre Realforce website]</ref> from Japan. However, while their products are for sale on [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] (new and used), they are generally less available in large parts of the world. Topre's key switches use a spring below a rubber dome. The dome provides most of the force that keeps the key from being pressed, similar to a membrane keyboard, while the spring helps with the capacitive action. <ref>https://www.pcgamer.com/best-mechanical-switches-for-gaming/</ref>\n\n=== Mechanical-switch keyboard ===\n\nEach key on a mechanical-switch keyboard contains a complete switch underneath. Each switch is composed of a housing, a spring, and a stem, and sometimes other parts such as a separate tactile leaf or a clickbar. Switches come in three variants: '''linear''' with consistent resistance; '''tactile''' with a non-audible bump; and '''clicky''', a tactile with an audible click.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/|title=The Comparative Guide to Mechanical Switches |website=input.club|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref> Depending on the resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts of pressure to actuate and to bottom out. The shape of the stem as well as the design of the switch housing varies the actuation distance and travel distance of the switch. The amount of sound produced by actuation can also be changed by the addition of rubber dampeners. Like other types of keyboards, mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps, but replacing them is more common with mechanical keyboards due to common stem shapes.\n\nMechanical keyboards typically have a longer lifespan than membrane or dome-switch keyboards. Cherry MX switches, for example, have an expected lifespan of 50 million clicks per switch<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://cherryamericas.com/product/mx-series-2/ |website=Cherry Americas | title=MX series 2}}</ref>, while switches from [[Razer Inc.|Razer]] have a rated lifetime of 60 million clicks per switch.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://deskthority.net/wiki/Razer_switch | website=Deskthority wiki |title=Razer switch}}</ref>\n\nThe major current mechanical switch producer is [[Cherry (keyboards)|Cherry]]. [[Alps Electric]], a former major producer, ended production in the early 2000s,<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Mechanical 'Clicky' Keyboards Still Have Followers\n | website = slashdot.org\n | date = May 15, 2015\n | url = http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/05/15/1947238/mechanical-clicky-keyboards-still-have-followers-video\n}}</ref> but Alps style switches continue to be made by others companies as [[Matias Corporation|Matias]], Xiang Min(XM),<ref>[http://xiangmin.myweb.hinet.net Xiang Min website]</ref> Tai-Hao (APC)<ref>[http://www.tai-hao.com/ Tai-Hao website]</ref> and Hua-Jie (AK).<ref>[http://www.hua-jie.com Hua-Jie website]</ref> Other switch manufacturers include Gateron,<ref>[http://www.gateron.com/ Gateron website]</ref> Kaihua (Kailh),<ref>[http://www.kailh.com Kaihua website]</ref> Gaote (Outemu),<ref>[http://www.cngaote.com/ Gaote website]</ref> Greetech,<ref>[http://www.greetech.com/ Greetech website]</ref> TTC<ref>[http://www.ttc9.com TTC website]</ref> and [[Omron]].\n\n=== Buckling-spring keyboard ===\n[[File:Bucklingspring1-o.svg|thumb|Illustration from the original buckling spring {{US patent|4118611}}, issued to IBM in 1978.]]\nMany typists prefer [[buckling spring]] keyboards.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dansdata.com/ibmkeyboard.htm | journal = Dan's Data | type = review | title = IBM 42H1292 and 1391401 keyboards | origyear = 15 August 1999 | date = 13 Nov 2007 | access-date = 23 November 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131123005000/http://www.dansdata.com/ibmkeyboard.htm | archive-date = 23 November 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref>  The [[buckling spring]] mechanism (expired {{US patent |4118611}}) atop the switch is responsible for the tactile and aural response of the keyboard.

New [[Model M keyboard]]s continued to be manufactured for IBM by Lexmark until 1999, when [[Unicomp]] purchased the keyboard technology.\n\nToday, new buckling-spring keyboards are manufactured by Unicomp. Unicomp also repairs old IBM and Lexmark keyboards.\n\n=== Hall-effect keyboard ===\n[[Hall effect]] keyboards use [[magnet]]s and [[Hall effect sensor]]s instead of switches with mechanical contacts. When a key is depressed, it moves a magnet that is detected by a solid-state sensor. Because they require no physical contact for actuation, Hall-effect keyboards are extremely reliable and can accept millions of keystrokes before failing. They are used for ultra-high reliability applications such as nuclear power plants, aircraft cockpits, and critical industrial environments. They can easily be made totally waterproof, and can resist large amounts of dust and contaminants. Because a magnet and sensor are required for each key, as well as custom control electronics, they are expensive to manufacture.\n\n=== Laser projection keyboard ===\n\n{{main|Projection keyboard}}\n\nA laser projection device approximately the size of a computer mouse projects the outline of keyboard keys onto a flat surface, such as a table or desk. This type of keyboard is portable enough to be easily used with PDAs and cellphones, and many models have retractable cords and wireless capabilities. However, sudden or accidental disruption of the laser will register unwanted keystrokes. Also, if the laser malfunctions, the whole unit becomes useless, unlike conventional keyboards which can be used even if a variety of parts (such as the keycaps) are removed. This type of keyboard can be frustrating to use since it is susceptible to errors, even in the course of normal typing, and its complete lack of tactile feedback makes it even less user-friendly than the lowest quality membrane keyboards.\n\n=== Roll-up keyboard ===\n[[File:Foldable keyboard.jpg|thumb|right|Most keyboards are rigid, but this keyboard demonstrates one of many variations from the norm.]]\n{{see also|Roll-away computer}}\nKeyboards made of flexible silicone or polyurethane materials can roll up in a moderately tight bundle. Tightly folding the keyboard may damage the internal membrane circuits. When they are completely sealed in rubber they are water resistant. Like membrane keyboards, they are reported to be very hard to get used to, as there is little tactile feedback, and silicone will tend to attract dirt, dust, and hair.\n\n=== Optical keyboard technology ===\nAlso known as photo-optical keyboard, light responsive keyboard, photo-electric keyboard, and optical key actuation detection technology.\n\nOptical keyboard technology was introduced in 1962 by Harley E. Kelchner for use in a typewriter machine with the purpose of reducing the noise generating by actuating the typewriter keys.\n\nAn optical keyboard technology utilizes [[Light-emitting diode|light-emitting devices]] and [[Photoelectric sensor|photo sensors]] to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and sensors are located at the perimeter, mounted on a small [[Printed circuit board|PCB]]. The [[light]] is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior, and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical keyboards require at least 2 beams (most commonly a vertical beam and a horizontal beam) to determine the actuated key. Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per row of keys (most commonly a horizontal beam).\n\nThe mechanism of the optical keyboard is very simple \u2013 a light beam is sent from the emitter to the receiving sensor, and the actuated key blocks, [[Reflection (physics)|reflects]], [[Refraction|refracts]] or otherwise interacts with the beam, resulting in an identified key.\n\nSome earlier optical keyboards were limited in their structure and required special casing to block external light, no multi-key functionality was supported and the design was very limited to a thick rectangular case.\n\nThe advantages of optical keyboard technology are that it offers a real waterproof keyboard, resilient to dust and liquids; and it uses about 20% PCB volume, compared with membrane or dome switch keyboards, significantly reducing [[electronic waste]].\nAdditional advantages of optical keyboard technology over other keyboard technologies such as Hall effect, laser, roll-up, and transparent keyboards lie in cost (Hall effect keyboard) and feel \u2013 optical keyboard technology does not require different key mechanisms, and the tactile feel of typing has remained the same for over 60 years.\n\nThe specialist [[DataHand]] keyboard uses optical technology to sense keypresses with a single light beam and sensor per key. The keys are held in their rest position by [[magnet]]s; when the magnetic force is overcome to press a key, the optical path is unblocked and the keypress is registered.\n\n== Debouncing ==\nWhen striking a keyboard key, the key oscillates (or bounces) against its contacts several times before settling. When released, it oscillates again until it reverts to its rest state. Although it happens on such a small scale as to be invisible to the naked eye, it's sufficient for the computer to register multiple key strokes inadvertently.\n\nTo resolve this problem, the processor in a keyboard \"[[Debounce#Contact_bounce|debounce]]s\" the keystrokes, by aggregating them across time to produce one \"confirmed\" keystroke that (usually) corresponds to what is typically a solid contact. Early membrane keyboards had limited typing speed because they had to do significant debouncing. This was a noticeable problem on the [[ZX81]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}\n\n== Keycaps ==\n[[keycap|Keycaps]] are used on full-travel keyboards. While modern keycaps are typically surface-printed, they can also be [[Injection molding#Design|double-shot molded]], laser printed, sublimation printed, engraved, or they can be made of transparent material with printed paper inserts.\n\nThere are also keycaps which are thin shells that are placed over key bases. These were used on IBM PC keyboards.\n\n== Other parts of the PC keyboard ==\nThe modern PC keyboard also includes a control processor and indicator lights to provide feedback to the user about what state the keyboard is in. Depending on the sophistication of the controller's programming, the keyboard may also offer other special features. The processor is usually a single chip [[Intel 8048|8048]] [[microcontroller]] variant. The keyboard switch matrix is wired to its inputs and it processes the incoming keystrokes and sends the results down a serial cable (the keyboard cord) to a receiver in the main computer box. It also controls the illumination of the \"[[caps lock]]\", \"[[num lock]]\" and \"[[scroll lock]]\" lights.\n\nA common test for whether the computer has crashed is pressing the \"caps lock\" key. The keyboard sends the key code to the [[Device driver|keyboard driver]] running in the main computer; if the main computer is operating, it commands the light to turn on. All the other indicator lights work in a similar way. The keyboard driver also tracks the [[shift key|shift]], [[alt key|alt]] and [[control key|control]] state of the keyboard.\n\n== Keyboard switch matrix ==\n{{main |Keyboard matrix circuit}}\nThe keyboard switch matrix is often drawn with horizontal wires and vertical wires in a grid which is called a [[keyboard matrix (music)|matrix circuit]]. It has a switch at some or all intersections, much like a [[multiplexed display]]. Almost all keyboards have only the switch at each intersection, which causes \"ghost keys\" and \"key jamming\" when multiple keys are pressed ([[rollover (key) |rollover]]). Certain, often more expensive, keyboards have a diode between each intersection, allowing the keyboard microcontroller to accurately sense any number of simultaneous keys being pressed, without generating erroneous ghost keys.<ref>{{cite web | first =Dave | last = Dribin | title = Keyboard Matrix Help|url= http://www.dribin.org/dave/keyboard/}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n*[[List of mechanical keyboards]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*{{cite news|last1=Schofield|first1=Jack|title=Which ThinkPad laptops have the best keyboards?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2014/may/09/which-thinkpad-laptops-have-the-best-keyboards|accessdate=4 January 2018|work=The Guardian|date=9 May 2014}}\n*[https://gamehub.blog/razer-huntsman-elite-review/ Razer Huntsman Elite Keyboard Review] by GameHub at gamehub.blog\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Keyboard Technology}}\n[[Category:Computer keyboards]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Technology of keyboards}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{lead too short|date=January 2015}}\n{{original research|date=January 2015}}\n{{refimprove|date=February 2013}}\n}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=April 2013}}\n[[File:Keyboard Construction.JPG|right|thumb| Keyboard construction, in four layers, of a typical notebook computer keyboard]]\n[[Computer keyboard]]s can be classified by the [[switch]] technology that they use. Computer alphanumeric keyboards typically have 80 to 110 durable switches, generally one for each key. The choice of switch technology affects key response (the positive feedback that a key has been pressed) and pre travel (the distance needed to push the key to enter a character reliably). Newer keyboard models use hybrids of various technologies to achieve greater cost savings.\n\n==Types==\n\n=== Membrane keyboard ===\n{{main|Membrane keyboard}}\nThere are two types of membrane-based keyboards, flat-panel membrane keyboards and full-travel membrane keyboards:\n\nFlat-panel membrane keyboards are most often found on appliances like [[microwave oven]]s or [[photocopier]]s. A common design consists of three layers. The top layer has the labels printed on its front and conductive stripes printed on the back. Under this it has a spacer layer, which holds the front and back layer apart so that they do not normally make electrical contact. The back layer has conductive stripes printed perpendicularly to those of the front layer. When placed together, the stripes form a grid. When the user pushes down at a particular position, their finger pushes the front layer down through the spacer layer to close a circuit at one of the intersections of the grid. This indicates to the computer or keyboard control processor that a particular button has been pressed.\n\nGenerally, flat-panel membrane keyboards do not produce a noticeable physical feedback. Therefore, devices using these issue a beep or flash a light when the key is pressed. They are often used in harsh environments where water- or leak-proofing is desirable. Although used in the early days of the [[personal computer]] (on the [[Sinclair ZX80]], [[Sinclair ZX81|ZX81]] and [[Atari 400]]), they have been supplanted by the more tactile dome and mechanical switch keyboards.\n\nFull-travel membrane-based keyboards are the most common computer keyboards today. They have one-piece plastic keytop/switch plungers which press down on a membrane to actuate a contact in an electrical switch matrix.\n\n=== Dome-switch keyboard ===<!-- This section is linked from [[Computer keyboard]] -->\n[[File:Keyboard Construction Button Press.JPG|right|thumb|How a dome-switch keyboard works: Finger depresses the dome to complete the circuit]]\n[[File:Membrane keyboard.jpg|right|thumb|Dome switches mesh with keys (keyboard is upside down in this image)]]\n{{see also|Chiclet keyboard}}\nDome-switch keyboards are a hybrid of [[Membrane keyboard|flat-panel membrane]] and mechanical-switch keyboards. They bring two circuit board traces together under a [[rubber]] or silicone keypad using either metal \"dome\" switches or polyurethane formed domes. The metal dome switches are formed pieces of stainless steel that, when compressed, give the user a crisp, positive tactile feedback. These metal types of dome switches are very common, are usually reliable to over 5 million cycles, and can be plated in either nickel, silver or gold. The rubber dome switches, most commonly referred to as polydomes, are formed polyurethane domes where the inside bubble is coated in graphite. While polydomes are typically cheaper than metal domes, they lack the crisp snap of the metal domes, and usually have a lower life specification. Polydomes are considered very quiet, but purists tend to find them \"mushy\" because the collapsing dome does not provide as much positive response as metal domes. For either metal or polydomes, when a key is pressed, it collapses the dome, which connects the two circuit traces and completes the connection to enter the character. The pattern on the PC board is often gold-plated.\n\nBoth are common switch technologies used in mass market keyboards today. This type of switch technology happens to be most commonly used in handheld controllers, mobile phones, automotive, consumer electronics and medical devices. Dome-switch keyboards are also called direct-switch keyboards.\n\n=== Scissor-switch keyboard ===\n[[File:Scissor switch mechanism.svg|thumb|left|Scissor switch mechanism]]\nA special case of the computer keyboard dome-switch is the scissor-switch. The keys are attached to the keyboard via two plastic pieces that interlock in a \"scissor\"-like fashion, and snap to the keyboard and the key. It still uses rubber domes, but a special plastic [[scissors mechanism| 'scissors' mechanism]] links the [[keycap]] to a plunger that depresses the rubber dome with a much shorter travel than the typical rubber dome keyboard. Typically scissor-switch keyboards also employ 3-layer membranes as the electrical component of the switch. They also usually have a shorter total key travel distance (2&nbsp;mm instead of 3.5 \u2013 4&nbsp;mm for standard dome-switch keyswitches). This type of keyswitch is often found on the built-in keyboards on laptops and keyboards marketed as 'low-profile'. These keyboards are generally quiet and the keys require little force to press.\n\nScissor-switch keyboards are typically slightly more expensive. They are harder to clean (due to the limited movement of the keys and their multiple attachment points) but also less likely to get debris in them as the gaps between the keys are often smaller (as there is no need for extra room to allow for the 'wiggle' in the key, as typically found on a membrane keyboard).<ref>{{Citation | title = Keyboards | contribution = Mechanical vs membrane keyswitches | publisher = Ergo | place = [[Canada |CA]] | contribution-url = http://www.ergocanada.ca/ergo/keyboards/mechanical_vs_membrane_keyswitches.html}}.</ref>\n\n=== Capacitive keyboard ===\nIn this type of keyboard, pressing a key changes the capacitance of a pattern of capacitor pads. The pattern consists of two D-shaped capacitor pads for each switch, printed on a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB) and covered by a thin, insulating film of [[soldermask]] which acts as a [[dielectric]].\n\nDespite the sophistication of the concept, the mechanism of capacitive switching is physically simple. The movable part ends with a flat foam element about the size of an [[Tablet (pharmacy)|aspirin tablet]], finished with aluminum foil. Opposite the switch is a PCB with the capacitor pads. When the key is pressed, the foil tightly clings to the surface of the PCB, forming a [[series circuits|daisy chain]] of two capacitors between [[contact pad]]s and itself separated with thin soldermask, and thus \"shorting\" the [[contact pad]]s with an easily detectable drop of [[capacitive reactance]] between them. Usually this permits a pulse or pulse train to be sensed. Because the switch doesn't have an actual electrical contact, there is no debouncing necessary. The keys do not need to be fully pressed to be actuated, which enables some people to type faster. The sensor tells enough about the position of the key to allow the user to adjust actuation point (key sensitivity). This adjustment can be done with the help of the bundled software and individually for each key, if so implemented. <ref>Topre keyboard documentation, describing various features [http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/products/R2SA-US4-IV/index.html] and they software manual [http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/support/download/REALFORCE_Software_Manual_EN.pdf pdf]</ref>\n\nThe IBM [[Model F keyboard]] is mechanical-key design consisted of a buckling spring over a capacitive PCB, similarly to the later Model M keyboard that used a membrane in place of the PCB. \n\nThe most known company for their capacitive (electrostatic) switching technology is Topre Corporation<ref>[http://www.realforce.co.jp/en/ Topre Realforce website]</ref> from Japan. However, while their products are for sale on [[eBay]] and [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] (new and used), they are generally less available in large parts of the world. Topre's key switches use a spring below a rubber dome. The dome provides most of the force that keeps the key from being pressed, similar to a membrane keyboard, while the spring helps with the capacitive action. <ref>https://www.pcgamer.com/best-mechanical-switches-for-gaming/</ref>\n\n=== Mechanical-switch keyboard ===\n\nEach key on a mechanical-switch keyboard contains a complete switch underneath. Each switch is composed of a housing, a spring, and a stem, and sometimes other parts such as a separate tactile leaf or a clickbar. Switches come in three variants: '''linear''' with consistent resistance; '''tactile''' with a non-audible bump; and '''clicky''', a tactile with an audible click.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://input.club/the-comparative-guide-to-mechanical-switches/|title=The Comparative Guide to Mechanical Switches |website=input.club|access-date=2018-10-16}}</ref> Depending on the resistance of the spring, the key requires different amounts of pressure to actuate and to bottom out. The shape of the stem as well as the design of the switch housing varies the actuation distance and travel distance of the switch. The amount of sound produced by actuation can also be changed by the addition of rubber dampeners. Like other types of keyboards, mechanical keyboards allow for the removal and replacement of keycaps, but replacing them is more common with mechanical keyboards due to common stem shapes.\n\nMechanical keyboards typically have a longer lifespan than membrane or dome-switch keyboards. Cherry MX switches, for example, have an expected lifespan of 50 million clicks per switch<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://cherryamericas.com/product/mx-series-2/ |website=Cherry Americas | title=MX series 2}}</ref>, while switches from [[Razer Inc.|Razer]] have a rated lifetime of 60 million clicks per switch.<ref>{{Cite web|url= https://deskthority.net/wiki/Razer_switch | website=Deskthority wiki |title=Razer switch}}</ref>\n\nThe major current mechanical switch producer is [[Cherry (keyboards)|Cherry]]. [[Alps Electric]], a former major producer, ended production in the early 2000s,<ref>{{Cite web\n | title = Mechanical 'Clicky' Keyboards Still Have Followers\n | website = slashdot.org\n | date = May 15, 2015\n | url = http://hardware.slashdot.org/story/15/05/15/1947238/mechanical-clicky-keyboards-still-have-followers-video\n}}</ref> but Alps style switches continue to be made by others companies as [[Matias Corporation|Matias]], Xiang Min(XM),<ref>[http://xiangmin.myweb.hinet.net Xiang Min website]</ref> Tai-Hao (APC)<ref>[http://www.tai-hao.com/ Tai-Hao website]</ref> and Hua-Jie (AK).<ref>[http://www.hua-jie.com Hua-Jie website]</ref> Other switch manufacturers include Gateron,<ref>[http://www.gateron.com/ Gateron website]</ref> Kaihua (Kailh),<ref>[http://www.kailh.com Kaihua website]</ref> Gaote (Outemu),<ref>[http://www.cngaote.com/ Gaote website]</ref> Greetech,<ref>[http://www.greetech.com/ Greetech website]</ref> TTC<ref>[http://www.ttc9.com TTC website]</ref> and [[Omron]].\n\n=== Buckling-spring keyboard ===\n[[File:Bucklingspring1-o.svg|thumb|Illustration from the original buckling spring {{US patent|4118611}}, issued to IBM in 1978.]]\nMany typists prefer [[buckling spring]] keyboards.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.dansdata.com/ibmkeyboard.htm | journal = Dan's Data | type = review | title = IBM 42H1292 and 1391401 keyboards | origyear = 15 August 1999 | date = 13 Nov 2007 | access-date = 23 November 2007 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131123005000/http://www.dansdata.com/ibmkeyboard.htm | archive-date = 23 November 2013 | url-status = dead }}</ref>  The [[buckling spring]] mechanism (expired {{US patent |4118611}}) atop the switch is responsible for the tactile and aural response of the keyboard.

New [[Model M keyboard]]s continued to be manufactured for IBM by Lexmark until 1999, when [[Unicomp]] purchased the keyboard technology.\n\nToday, new buckling-spring keyboards are manufactured by Unicomp. Unicomp also repairs old IBM and Lexmark keyboards.\n\n=== Hall-effect keyboard ===\n[[Hall effect]] keyboards use [[magnet]]s and [[Hall effect sensor]]s instead of switches with mechanical contacts. When a key is depressed, it moves a magnet that is detected by a solid-state sensor. Because they require no physical contact for actuation, Hall-effect keyboards are extremely reliable and can accept millions of keystrokes before failing. They are used for ultra-high reliability applications such as nuclear power plants, aircraft cockpits, and critical industrial environments. They can easily be made totally waterproof, and can resist large amounts of dust and contaminants. Because a magnet and sensor are required for each key, as well as custom control electronics, they are expensive to manufacture.\n\n=== Laser projection keyboard ===\n\n{{main|Projection keyboard}}\n\nA laser projection device approximately the size of a computer mouse projects the outline of keyboard keys onto a flat surface, such as a table or desk. This type of keyboard is portable enough to be easily used with PDAs and cellphones, and many models have retractable cords and wireless capabilities. However, sudden or accidental disruption of the laser will register unwanted keystrokes. Also, if the laser malfunctions, the whole unit becomes useless, unlike conventional keyboards which can be used even if a variety of parts (such as the keycaps) are removed. This type of keyboard can be frustrating to use since it is susceptible to errors, even in the course of normal typing, and its complete lack of tactile feedback makes it even less user-friendly than the lowest quality membrane keyboards.\n\n=== Roll-up keyboard ===\n[[File:Foldable keyboard.jpg|thumb|right|Most keyboards are rigid, but this keyboard demonstrates one of many variations from the norm.]]\n{{see also|Roll-away computer}}\nKeyboards made of flexible silicone or polyurethane materials can roll up in a moderately tight bundle. Tightly folding the keyboard may damage the internal membrane circuits. When they are completely sealed in rubber they are water resistant. Like membrane keyboards, they are reported to be very hard to get used to, as there is little tactile feedback, and silicone will tend to attract dirt, dust, and hair.\n\n=== Optical keyboard technology ===\nAlso known as photo-optical keyboard, light responsive keyboard, photo-electric keyboard, and optical key actuation detection technology.\n\nOptical keyboard technology was introduced in 1962 by Harley E. Kelchner for use in a typewriter machine with the purpose of reducing the noise generating by actuating the typewriter keys.\n\nAn optical keyboard technology utilizes [[Light-emitting diode|light-emitting devices]] and [[Photoelectric sensor|photo sensors]] to optically detect actuated keys. Most commonly the emitters and sensors are located at the perimeter, mounted on a small [[Printed circuit board|PCB]]. The [[light]] is directed from side to side of the keyboard interior, and it can only be blocked by the actuated keys. Most optical keyboards require at least 2 beams (most commonly a vertical beam and a horizontal beam) to determine the actuated key. Some optical keyboards use a special key structure that blocks the light in a certain pattern, allowing only one beam per row of keys (most commonly a horizontal beam).\n\nThe mechanism of the optical keyboard is very simple \u2013 a light beam is sent from the emitter to the receiving sensor, and the actuated key blocks, [[Reflection (physics)|reflects]], [[Refraction|refracts]] or otherwise interacts with the beam, resulting in an identified key.\n\nSome earlier optical keyboards were limited in their structure and required special casing to block external light, no multi-key functionality was supported and the design was very limited to a thick rectangular case.\n\nThe advantages of optical keyboard technology are that it offers a real waterproof keyboard, resilient to dust and liquids; and it uses about 20% PCB volume, compared with membrane or dome switch keyboards, significantly reducing [[electronic waste]].\nAdditional advantages of optical keyboard technology over other keyboard technologies such as Hall effect, laser, roll-up, and transparent keyboards lie in cost (Hall effect keyboard) and feel \u2013 optical keyboard technology does not require different key mechanisms, and the tactile feel of typing has remained the same for over 60 years.\n\nThe specialist [[DataHand]] keyboard uses optical technology to sense keypresses with a single light beam and sensor per key. The keys are held in their rest position by [[magnet]]s; when the magnetic force is overcome to press a key, the optical path is unblocked and the keypress is registered.\n\n== Debouncing ==\nWhen striking a keyboard key, the key oscillates (or bounces) against its contacts several times before settling.

Although Norman Wells [[Light crude oil|crude was light]] and easily flowed at temperatures as low as {{convert|-62|C|0}}, the line did not work well and was shut down shortly after the war ended.
