Miller''' (March 9, 1919 \u2013 May 15, 2001) was an American [[college basketball]] coach, a head coach for 38 years at three universities: [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|Wichita]] {{nowrap|(1951\u20131964),}} [[Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball|Iowa]], {{nowrap|(1964\u20131970),}} and [[Oregon State Beavers men's basketball|Oregon State]] {{nowrap|(1970\u20131989).<ref name=legcoadi>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zlVWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1usDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4050%2C3915848 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |last=Conrad |first=John |title=Legendary coach dies |date=May 17, 2001 |page=1D}}</ref>}} With an overall record of {{winning percentage|657|382|record=y}}, his teams had losing records only three times. Prior to his final season, he was enshrined in the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]] on {{nowrap|May 3, 1988.<ref name=ensrin88>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KAliAAAAIBAJ&sjid=leEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1660%2C854444 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=wire services |title=OSU's Miller enshrined in Hall of Fame |date=May 4, 1988 |page=1C}}</ref>}}\n\n==Early life==\nBorn and raised in [[Chanute, Kansas]],  Miller was a standout athlete in [[high school]] and [[college]].  At [[Chanute High School]], he won [[Varsity letter|letters]] in [[High school football|football]], [[Track and field|track]], [[basketball]], [[golf]] and [[tennis]]. Miller was an all-state basketball player for three years and set the state record in the [[low hurdles]] in 1937.  He was all-state three consecutive years in football and basketball.\n\nIn college at the [[University of Kansas]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], Miller won three letters as a [[Kansas Jayhawks football|football]] [[quarterback]] and three in [[Kansas Jayhawks basketball|basketball]].  By 1940, he was beating the [[Athletics at the 1932 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|1932 gold medalist in the decathlon]] [[Jim Bausch]] in seven of ten events.\n\nAs an undergraduate, he was coached by the legendary [[Phog Allen]]. In one of Miller's classes, a guest lecturer was [[Dr. James Naismith]], the inventor of basketball.  Miller was also a member of [[Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity]] {{nowrap|at KU.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Phi Kappa Psi (1991). Grand Catalogue of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity (13th ed.)|last=|first=|publisher=Publishing Concepts, Inc.|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=275, 493}}</ref>}}\n\nAfter he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[physical education]] in 1942, he spent three years in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]], leaving as a [[First lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]].\n\nMiller's first coaching position was at Mount Oread High School in Lawrence, and the team consisted primarily of professors' sons.  The season did not go well and left a sour taste in his mouth towards coaching basketball.\n\nMiller didn't have to go overseas during [[World War II]] because of knee problems that began at KU.  He enlisted in the Air Force and held desk jobs in [[Florida]], [[Texas]], and [[California]].  After the war, he became an assistant director of recreation and oversaw a swimming pool and playground in [[Redlands, California|Redlands]], [[California]].  Soon, he joined a friend in the business of hauling fruit.\n\nIn 1949, eight years after his ill-fated first attempt at coaching, a friend from [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] named Fritz Snodgrass sent Miller a telegram asking if he might be interested in returning to guide his son's team at [[Wichita High School East|East High School]].  At East, Miller became a student of the game.  He was fascinated by the [[full-court press]] [[zone defense]] that had been developed at Kansas in 1930, but he wondered why it was only used after a basket was made.  Nobody could give Miller a solid answer, and so he began tinkering with ways to press after missed shots, too.  His idea was to assign each player a man to guard, and when an errant shot went up, they were immediately to pick up their man.  His ideas were very successful.  In three years at East High, Miller's teams finished second, third and first in the state using his system of execution and pressure basketball.\n\n==College coaching==\n=== University of Wichita ===\nIn 1951, the president of the University of Wichita (now [[Wichita State University]]) offered him a job.  Miller spent 13 years at [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|Wichita]], winning 220 games, earning three [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] berths and a spot in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]].\n\n===University of Iowa===\nIn the spring of 1964, Miller left for the [[University of Iowa]] of the [[Big Ten Conference]], where he built one of the greatest offensive juggernauts in NCAA history.  The [[Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball|Hawkeyes]] averaged more than 100 points a game in Big Ten play in [[1969\u201370 Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team|1970]] and went undefeated (14\u20130) in the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] with a {{nowrap|19\u20134}} regular season record. Entering the [[1970 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]], Iowa was on a sixteen-game winning streak and played their first game in the [[1970 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament#Mideast region|Sweet Sixteen]], but were upset by independent {{nowrap|[[1969\u201370 Jacksonville Dolphins men's basketball team|Jacksonville]],<ref name=jxkywin>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sHZQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-xAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6922%2C2070449 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=UPI |title=Kentucky, Jacksonville win |date=March 13, 1970 |page= }}</ref>}} the eventual national runner-up.

Miller''' (March 9, 1919 \u2013 May 15, 2001) was an American [[college basketball]] coach, a head coach for 38 years at three universities: [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|Wichita]] {{nowrap|(1951\u20131964),}} [[Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball|Iowa]], {{nowrap|(1964\u20131970),}} and [[Oregon State Beavers men's basketball|Oregon State]] {{nowrap|(1970\u20131989).<ref name=legcoadi>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zlVWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=1usDAAAAIBAJ&pg=4050%2C3915848 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |last=Conrad |first=John |title=Legendary coach dies |date=May 17, 2001 |page=1D}}</ref>}} With an overall record of {{winning percentage|657|382|record=y}}, his teams had losing records only three times. Prior to his final season, he was enshrined in the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame|Basketball Hall of Fame]] on {{nowrap|May 3, 1988.<ref name=ensrin88>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KAliAAAAIBAJ&sjid=leEDAAAAIBAJ&pg=1660%2C854444 |work=Eugene Register-Guard |location=(Oregon) |agency=wire services |title=OSU's Miller enshrined in Hall of Fame |date=May 4, 1988 |page=1C}}</ref>}}\n\n==Early life==\nBorn and raised in [[Chanute, Kansas]],  Miller was a standout athlete in [[high school]] and [[college]].  At [[Chanute High School]], he won [[Varsity letter|letters]] in [[High school football|football]], [[Track and field|track]], [[basketball]], [[golf]] and [[tennis]]. Miller was an all-state basketball player for three years and set the state record in the [[low hurdles]] in 1937.  He was all-state three consecutive years in football and basketball.\n\nIn college at the [[University of Kansas]] in [[Lawrence, Kansas|Lawrence]], Miller won three letters as a [[Kansas Jayhawks football|football]] [[quarterback]] and three in [[Kansas Jayhawks basketball|basketball]].  By 1940, he was beating the [[Athletics at the 1932 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|1932 gold medalist in the decathlon]] [[Jim Bausch]] in seven of ten events.\n\nAs an undergraduate, he was coached by the legendary [[Phog Allen]]. In one of Miller's classes, a guest lecturer was [[Dr. James Naismith]], the inventor of basketball.  Miller was also a member of [[Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity]] {{nowrap|at KU.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Phi Kappa Psi (1991). Grand Catalogue of the Phi Kappa Psi Fraternity (13th ed.)|last=|first=|publisher=Publishing Concepts, Inc.|year=1991|isbn=|location=|pages=275, 493}}</ref>}}\n\nAfter he earned a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[physical education]] in 1942, he spent three years in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]], leaving as a [[First lieutenant#United States|first lieutenant]].\n\nMiller's first coaching position was at Mount Oread High School in Lawrence, and the team consisted primarily of professors' sons.  The season did not go well and left a sour taste in his mouth towards coaching basketball.\n\nMiller didn't have to go overseas during [[World War II]] because of knee problems that began at KU.  He enlisted in the Air Force and held desk jobs in [[Florida]], [[Texas]], and [[California]].  After the war, he became an assistant director of recreation and oversaw a swimming pool and playground in [[Redlands, California|Redlands]], [[California]].  Soon, he joined a friend in the business of hauling fruit.\n\nIn 1949, eight years after his ill-fated first attempt at coaching, a friend from [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] named Fritz Snodgrass sent Miller a telegram asking if he might be interested in returning to guide his son's team at [[Wichita High School East|East High School]].  At East, Miller became a student of the game.  He was fascinated by the [[full-court press]] [[zone defense]] that had been developed at Kansas in 1930, but he wondered why it was only used after a basket was made.  Nobody could give Miller a solid answer, and so he began tinkering with ways to press after missed shots, too.  His idea was to assign each player a man to guard, and when an errant shot went up, they were immediately to pick up their man.  His ideas were very successful.  In three years at East High, Miller's teams finished second, third and first in the state using his system of execution and pressure basketball.\n\n==College coaching==\n=== University of Wichita ===\nIn 1951, the president of the University of Wichita (now [[Wichita State University]]) offered him a job.  Miller spent 13 years at [[Wichita State Shockers men's basketball|Wichita]], winning 220 games, earning three [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] berths and a spot in the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] in [[1964 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|1964]].\n\n===University of Iowa===\nIn the spring of 1964, Miller left for the [[University of Iowa]] of the [[Big Ten Conference]], where he built one of the greatest offensive juggernauts in NCAA history.  The [[Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball|Hawkeyes]] averaged more than 100 points a game in Big Ten play in [[1969\u201370 Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team|1970]] and went undefeated (14\u20130) in the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] with a {{nowrap|19\u20134}} regular season record. Entering the [[1970 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]], Iowa was on a sixteen-game winning streak and played their first game in the [[1970 NCAA University Division Basketball Tournament#Mideast region|Sweet Sixteen]], but were upset by independent {{nowrap|[[1969\u201370 Jacksonville Dolphins men's basketball team|Jacksonville]],<ref name=jxkywin>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sHZQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=-xAEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6922%2C2070449 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |agency=UPI |title=Kentucky, Jacksonville win |date=March 13, 1970 |page= }}</ref>}} the eventual national runner-up.

Nagurski was also a successful [[professional wrestler]],<ref name=tankwolf>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZWoaAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AioEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5032%2C953430 |work=Milwaukee Journal |last=Wolf |first=Bob |title=A tank! Bronko Nagurski hit like one, ran like one |date=February 2, 1984 |page=3, part 3}}</ref> recognized as a multiple-time World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nNagurski became a standout playing both [[Tackle (gridiron football position)|tackle]] on defense and [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] on offense at the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]] from [[1927 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|1927]] to [[1929 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|1929]], selected a consensus [[College Football All-America Team|All-American]] in [[1929 College Football All-America Team|1929]] and inducted into the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] in its inaugural year of 1951. His professional career with the [[Chicago Bears]], which began in 1930 and ended on two occasions in 1937 and 1943, also made him an inaugural inductee into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] in 1963.\n\n==Youth and collegiate career==\nNagurski was born in [[Rainy River, Ontario]], Canada, in a family of [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] and [[Poles|Polish]] descent. His family moved to [[International Falls, Minnesota]], when he was five years old. His parents, \"Mike\" and Michelina Nagurski, were immigrants, from the Western Ukraine of [[Kresy]] where many ethnicities lived together ([[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]). Nagurski grew up working on his parents' farm and sawmill, delivering groceries for his father's grocery store and in his teens laboring at nearby timbering operations, growing into a powerfully muscular six-footer.\n\nNagurski was discovered and signed by University of Minnesota head coach [[Clarence Spears]], who drove to International Falls to meet another player. On the outside of town, he watched Nagurski out plowing a field without assistance. According to legend, Spears asked directions and Bronko lifted his plow and used it to point.<ref name=tankwolf/> He was signed on the spot to play for the Golden Gophers. Spears admitted he concocted the story on his long drive back to the university in Minneapolis.\n\nLegends aside, on his first day of practice Spears decided to test Nagurski in the \"Nutcracker\" drill, where a defensive player had to take on two blockers and try to tackle a following ball carrier. On the first drill two All-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] linemen and [[Herb Joesting]] charged at Bronko, who promptly split the blockers and drove the big fullback into a blocking dummy.

In 1929, after posting 737 rushing yards, he was a consensus [[1929 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] at fullback, and despite playing fewer games at the position also made some All-American teams at tackle. The pre-eminent sportswriter of the day, [[Grantland Rice]], listed him at the two positions in picking his 1929 All-America team. Rice later wrote, \"Who would you pick to win a football game - 11 [[Jim Thorpe]]s - 11 [[Glenn Davis (halfback)|Glen Davises]] - 11 [[Red Grange]]s - or 11 Bronko Nagurskis?

On the first drill two All-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] linemen and [[Herb Joesting]] charged at Bronko, who promptly split the blockers and drove the big fullback into a blocking dummy. Spears sent in three more players, blew his whistle and watched Bronko produce the same explosive results and after a third try with the same conclusion realized what a super player he had recruited.\n\nNagurski became a standout playing both tackle on defense and fullback on offense at Minnesota from [[1927 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|1927]] to [[1929 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|1929]]. In 1929, after posting 737 rushing yards, he was a consensus [[1929 College Football All-America Team|All-American]] at fullback, and despite playing fewer games at the position also made some All-American teams at tackle. The pre-eminent sportswriter of the day, [[Grantland Rice]], listed him at the two positions in picking his 1929 All-America team. Rice later wrote, \"Who would you pick to win a football game - 11 [[Jim Thorpe]]s - 11 [[Glenn Davis (halfback)|Glen Davises]] - 11 [[Red Grange]]s - or 11 Bronko Nagurskis? The 11 Nagurskis would be a mop-up. It would be something close to murder and massacre. For the Bronk could star at any position on the field, with {{convert|216|lb}} of authority to back him up.\"\n\nHis greatest collegiate game was against [[1928 Wisconsin Badgers football team|Wisconsin]] in the season finale in [[1928 Minnesota Golden Gophers football team|1928]]. Wearing a corset to protect cracked vertebrae, he recovered a Badger fumble deep in their territory, then ran the ball six straight times to score the go-ahead touchdown. Later in the same game, he intercepted a pass to seal the victory.<ref name=gcbho>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4mJQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=FA8EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7234%2C4739638 |work=Milwaukee Sentinel |last=Downer |first=George F. |title=Gophers crush Badger hopes, 6 to 0 |date=November 25, 1928 |page=1, part 3}}</ref>\n\nDuring his three varsity seasons at Minnesota, the Gophers went {{winning percentage|18|4|2|record=y}} and won the [[Big Ten Conference]] championship in 1927.

The USA team won their next four games, setting up the gold medal game against USSR. This game was also close, and was tied at 82 points each with six seconds to go in the game. The Soviets Elena Chausova received the inbounds pass and hit the game winning shot in the final seconds, giving the USSR team the gold medal with a score of 84\u201382.

As a Brave, he earned a spot as a footnote in history. On April 8, 1974, he was on deck when [[Hank Aaron]] hit home run 715 to pass [[Babe Ruth]] in career home runs.\n\nMany of Baker's accomplishments as a player came during his time with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], which include playing for the [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team in 1981 and 1982, and winning three League Championship series in [[1977 National League Championship Series|1977]], [[1978 National League Championship Series|1978]], and [[1981 National League Championship Series|1981]]. Baker ultimately won a [[World Series Trophy|World Series]] title in [[1981 World Series|1981]] with the Dodgers. However, Baker played poorly during the series, batting .167 with an [[On-base percentage|OBP]] of .192.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1981_WS.shtml 1981 World Series - Los Angeles Dodgers over New York Yankees (4-2) | Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAfter spending eight full seasons with the Braves and another eight with the Dodgers, as well as short tenures with both the [[San Francisco Giants]] and [[Oakland Athletics]], Baker finished his career as a player in 1986 with a .278 batting average, 242 [[home run]]s, and 1,013 [[runs batted in]].\n\nMany believe that Baker played an integral part in the first ever [[high five]], which occurred between Baker and Dodgers teammate [[Glenn Burke]] on October 2, 1977, at [[Dodger Stadium]], a story featured in the [[ESPN]] [[30 for 30]] documentary [http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thehighfive \"The High Five\"] directed by Michael Jacobs.<ref name=\"mooallem\">Jon Mooallem.

His Giants went on to win division titles in [[1997 San Francisco Giants season|1997]] and again in [[2000 San Francisco Giants season|2000]]; Baker would win Manager of the Year honors in both of those years as well.

With the help of an impressive pitching staff and big gun batters such as [[Sammy Sosa]] and [[Mois\u00e9s Alou]], the [[2003 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] were able to claim their first division title in 14 years. However, the Cubs\u2019 hopes for winning a [[World Series]] title were cut short during the [[2003 National League Championship Series]] against the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]], which included the infamous [[Steve Bartman Incident]] in Game 6 when the Cubs were up 3-0 and five outs from their first World Series appearance in almost 60 years. The Bartman incident proved to be a media distraction, but in fact it was critical execution failures by Cubs' players, such as a ball-four wild pitch, a fielding error on a would-be inning-ending double play, and a bad throw from the outfield after a single, which permitted the Marlins to score 8 runs in that eighth inning, to win the game 8-3. The Marlins would go on to win Game 7, and the [[2003 World Series]].\n\nIn [[2004 Chicago Cubs season|2004]], the team was involved in a heated [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]] chase with the [[2004 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]], but fell out of contention near the season's end. In [[2005 Chicago Cubs season|2005]] the Cubs lost several of their key players, most notably ace pitchers [[Mark Prior]] and [[Kerry Wood]], to injuries. The team finished the season with a 79\u201383 record, marking the first time in three years that the Cubs finished with a losing record. The Cubs\u2019 performance continued to decline in [[2006 Chicago Cubs season|2006]] as they fell to 66\u201396<ref name=\"managerial record\"/> and finished last in the entire [[National League]].\n\nA month after that season ended, the Cubs declined to renew Baker's contract. They allowed Baker to address the media in a press conference in early October, where he officially announced his departure. The Cubs turned to [[Lou Piniella]] to replace Baker for the [[2007 Chicago Cubs season]]. Baker finished his tenure with a regular season record of 322 wins and 326 losses and a post-season record of six wins and six losses.<ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n\n===Cincinnati Reds===\n[[File:DustybakerRedsfest.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dusty Baker sporting his new Reds jersey at RedsFest 2007.]]\nOn October 13, 2007, Baker was hired as manager of the Cincinnati Reds, replacing interim manager [[Pete Mackanin]].<ref>{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times |title=Reds give Dusty Baker a three-year deal |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-newswire14oct14,1,4876134.story?coll=la-headlines-sports |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024202900/http://latimes.com/sports/la-sp-newswire14oct14,1,4876134.story?coll=la-headlines-sports |archivedate=October 24, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Baker and the Reds finished 74-88 and 78-84 in [[2008 Cincinnati Reds season|2008]] and [[2009 Cincinnati Reds season|2009]], finishing 5th and 4th in the [[National League Central|NL Central]].

The 2002 postseason was the only time in his managerial career with the Giants that he won a postseason series. The [[2003 NLDS]] with the Cubs was only his third series win, and he never got past the Division Series in any of his next five postseason appearances with the Reds or Nationals.  Dating back to 2003, Baker-managed teams have lost 10 straight postseason \"close-out\" games in which they had the opportunity to advance to the next round of the playoffs.<ref>{{cite tweet |user=ESPNStatsInfo |number=918712024770555904 |title=Dusty Baker: his teams have lost 10 straight postseason close-out games (an MLB record) |date=October 12, 2017}}</ref>\n\nBaker has notably presided over some of the biggest collapses in baseball history.{{Citation needed|date = November 2015}} In 1993, his Giants led the National League West by 9.5 games on August 7, but ended up losing the division to the Atlanta Braves and missing the postseason. The Giants lost 12-1 on the final day of the season when a win could have forced a tiebreaking game with Atlanta for the division championship. In 2002, the Giants led the [[2002 World Series|World Series]] against the Anaheim Angels 3 games to 2. San Francisco had a 5-0 lead in the seventh inning of the sixth game, but allowed the Angels to score six unanswered runs in the seventh and eighth innings to win. The Angels also won Game 7 to win the championship. In 2003, Baker's Cubs led the [[2003 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] 3 games to 1 against the Florida Marlins. The Marlins stormed back to win the final three games of the series, including overcoming a 3-0 Chicago lead with 8 runs in the eighth inning of Game 6. The loss in that game was blamed in part on poor managing, notably leaving starter Mark Prior in the game when he had already thrown over 100 pitches. In 2012, Baker's Reds led the [[2012 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] 2 games to 0 against the San Francisco Giants. With the final three games of the series at home in Cincinnati, the Reds needed to win just once to advance to the National League Championship Series, but the Giants completed the comeback by winning games 3, 4, and 5 and went on to win the World Series. The Reds also suffered a six-game losing streak to end the 2013 season, including a loss in the [[2013 National League Wild Card Game|Wild Card]] game at Pittsburgh. Reds general manager [[Walt Jocketty]] admitted the team's latest collapse played a role in the decision to fire Baker.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9767640/manager-dusty-baker-fired-3-days-cincinnati-reds-ouster|title= Reds dismiss manager Dusty Baker|date=October 4, 2013|work=ESPN|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Managerial record===\n\n{{updated|games played on October 13, 2017}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Team!!rowspan=\"2\"|From!!rowspan=\"2\"|To!!colspan=\"4\"|Regular season record!!colspan=\"4\"|Post\u2013season record\n|-\n!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}!!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}!!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}!!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}!!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}!!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}!!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}!!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n|-\n|[[San Francisco Giants]]||[[1993 San Francisco Giants season|1993]]||[[2002 San Francisco Giants season|2002]]\n|1555\n|{{WinLossPct|840|715}}\n|24\n|{{WinLossPct|11|13}}\n|-\n|[[Chicago Cubs]]||[[2003 Chicago Cubs season|2003]]||[[2006 Chicago Cubs season|2006]]\n|648\n|{{WinLossPct|322|326}}\n|12\n|{{WinLossPct|6|6}}\n|-\n|[[Cincinnati Reds]]||[[2008 Cincinnati Reds season|2008]]||[[2013 Cincinnati Reds season|2013]]\n|972\n|{{WinLossPct|509|463}}\n|9\n|{{WinLossPct|2|7}}\n|-\n|[[Washington Nationals]]||[[2016 Washington Nationals season|2016]]||[[2017 Washington Nationals season|2017]]\n|324\n|{{WinLossPct|192|132}}\n|10\n|{{WinLossPct|4|6}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Total\n!3499\n!{{WinLossPct|1863|1636}}\n!55\n!{{WinLossPct|23|32}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"11\"|{{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}:<ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|}\n\n==Broadcasting career==\nBaker served as an [[ESPN]] analyst during the 2006 MLB Postseason and served in a similar role during the 2007 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-01-25/sports/0701250142_1_managerial-candidate-giants-and-cubs-nl-central-title |title=Baker's ESPN job has out for managing |date=January 25, 2007 |first=Mark |last=Gonzales |work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/espn-signs-baker-baseball-130138 |title=ESPN signs Baker for baseball |first=Paul J. |last=Gough |date=February 14, 2007 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> In 2015, Baker joined [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] as a studio analyst for the final two weeks of their regular season coverage and for their coverage of the National League playoffs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2015/aa-qa-new-mlb-on-tbs-analyst-dusty-baker-talks-return-to-tv-baseballs-changes-and-more.html|title=AA Q&A: New MLB on TBS Analyst Dusty Baker Talks Return to TV, Baseball's Changes, and More|last1=Bucholtz|first1=Andrew|date=September 17, 2015|website=Awful Announcing|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBaker was a member of the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] from 1969 through 1975.<ref>[http://www.speaking.com/speakers/dustybaker.html Speakers Platform] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219041252/http://www.speaking.com/speakers/dustybaker.html |date=February 19, 2008 }}</ref> Baker has a wife, Melissa, and two children named Natosha (born 1979) and Darren (born 1999).

is an American [[Major League Baseball]] manager for the [[Houston Astros]] and retired player. He had a 19-year career as a hard-hitting [[outfielder]], primarily with the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. He helped the Dodgers to pennants in [[1977 World Series|1977]] and [[1978 World Series|1978]] and to the World Series championship in [[1981 World Series|1981]]. He managed the [[San Francisco Giants]], [[Chicago Cubs]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], and [[Washington Nationals]]. He led the Giants to the [[2002 World Series|2002 National League pennant]] and also reached the playoffs with the latter three teams. In 2020, he was hired to manage the [[Houston Astros]].<ref name=\"espn12920\">[https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/28594178/astros-hire-dusty-baker-short-term-deal-new-manager Astros hire Dusty Baker to short-term deal as new manager]</ref>\n\n==Playing career==\nBaker was drafted by the [[Atlanta Braves]] in the 1967 amateur draft out of [[Del Campo High School]] near [[Sacramento, California]].

As a Brave, he earned a spot as a footnote in history. On April 8, 1974, he was on deck when [[Hank Aaron]] hit home run 715 to pass [[Babe Ruth]] in career home runs.\n\nMany of Baker's accomplishments as a player came during his time with the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], which include playing for the [[National League]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] team in 1981 and 1982, and winning three League Championship series in [[1977 National League Championship Series|1977]], [[1978 National League Championship Series|1978]], and [[1981 National League Championship Series|1981]]. Baker ultimately won a [[World Series Trophy|World Series]] title in [[1981 World Series|1981]] with the Dodgers. However, Baker played poorly during the series, batting .167 with an [[On-base percentage|OBP]] of .192.<ref>[https://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1981_WS.shtml 1981 World Series - Los Angeles Dodgers over New York Yankees (4-2) | Baseball-Reference.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nAfter spending eight full seasons with the Braves and another eight with the Dodgers, as well as short tenures with both the [[San Francisco Giants]] and [[Oakland Athletics]], Baker finished his career as a player in 1986 with a .278 batting average, 242 [[home run]]s, and 1,013 [[runs batted in]].\n\nMany believe that Baker played an integral part in the first ever [[high five]], which occurred between Baker and Dodgers teammate [[Glenn Burke]] on October 2, 1977, at [[Dodger Stadium]], a story featured in the [[ESPN]] [[30 for 30]] documentary [http://espn.go.com/30for30/film?page=thehighfive \"The High Five\"] directed by Michael Jacobs.<ref name=\"mooallem\">Jon Mooallem.

In his first year as Giants manager, he won the [[Major League Baseball Manager of the Year Award|NL Manager of the Year]] award, leading the team to a 103\u201359 record, which was the second-best record in baseball that year (behind the 104\u201358 [[1993 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]]), and 31 games better than their 72\u201390 finish the previous year. His Giants went on to win division titles in [[1997 San Francisco Giants season|1997]] and again in [[2000 San Francisco Giants season|2000]]; Baker would win Manager of the Year honors in both of those years as well.

[[Cito Gaston]] (the only African American manager to win a World Series) was the first, managing the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] to the championship in [[1992 World Series|1992]] and [[1993 World Series|1993]]. Baker was the second, and [[Ron Washington]] and [[Dave Roberts (outfielder)|Dave Roberts]] have since joined Gaston and Baker by managing the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], respectively, to the [[World Series]]. Baker also has the second most wins as manager in the San Francisco portion of Giants history; only [[Bruce Bochy]] has won more games since their move from New York.\n\n===Chicago Cubs===\n[[File:Baker and Cooper 2006.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Baker meeting with [[Cecil Cooper]] of the [[Houston Astros]] prior to a [[2006 Chicago Cubs season|2006]] matchup at [[Wrigley Field]].]]\nBaker made a major impact with the Cubs in 2003, his first season as manager for the ball club. With the help of an impressive pitching staff and big gun batters such as [[Sammy Sosa]] and [[Mois\u00e9s Alou]], the [[2003 Chicago Cubs season|Cubs]] were able to claim their first division title in 14 years. However, the Cubs\u2019 hopes for winning a [[World Series]] title were cut short during the [[2003 National League Championship Series]] against the [[2003 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]], which included the infamous [[Steve Bartman Incident]] in Game 6 when the Cubs were up 3-0 and five outs from their first World Series appearance in almost 60 years. The Bartman incident proved to be a media distraction, but in fact it was critical execution failures by Cubs' players, such as a ball-four wild pitch, a fielding error on a would-be inning-ending double play, and a bad throw from the outfield after a single, which permitted the Marlins to score 8 runs in that eighth inning, to win the game 8-3. The Marlins would go on to win Game 7, and the [[2003 World Series]].\n\nIn [[2004 Chicago Cubs season|2004]], the team was involved in a heated [[Wild card (sports)#Major League Baseball|wild card]] chase with the [[2004 Houston Astros season|Houston Astros]], but fell out of contention near the season's end. In [[2005 Chicago Cubs season|2005]] the Cubs lost several of their key players, most notably ace pitchers [[Mark Prior]] and [[Kerry Wood]], to injuries. The team finished the season with a 79\u201383 record, marking the first time in three years that the Cubs finished with a losing record. The Cubs\u2019 performance continued to decline in [[2006 Chicago Cubs season|2006]] as they fell to 66\u201396<ref name=\"managerial record\"/> and finished last in the entire [[National League]].\n\nA month after that season ended, the Cubs declined to renew Baker's contract. They allowed Baker to address the media in a press conference in early October, where he officially announced his departure. The Cubs turned to [[Lou Piniella]] to replace Baker for the [[2007 Chicago Cubs season]]. Baker finished his tenure with a regular season record of 322 wins and 326 losses and a post-season record of six wins and six losses.<ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n\n===Cincinnati Reds===\n[[File:DustybakerRedsfest.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Dusty Baker sporting his new Reds jersey at RedsFest 2007.]]\nOn October 13, 2007, Baker was hired as manager of the Cincinnati Reds, replacing interim manager [[Pete Mackanin]].<ref>{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times |title=Reds give Dusty Baker a three-year deal |url=http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-newswire14oct14,1,4876134.story?coll=la-headlines-sports |accessdate=October 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071024202900/http://latimes.com/sports/la-sp-newswire14oct14,1,4876134.story?coll=la-headlines-sports |archivedate=October 24, 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Baker and the Reds finished 74-88 and 78-84 in [[2008 Cincinnati Reds season|2008]] and [[2009 Cincinnati Reds season|2009]], finishing 5th and 4th in the [[National League Central|NL Central]].

In 2002, the Giants led the [[2002 World Series|World Series]] against the Anaheim Angels 3 games to 2. San Francisco had a 5-0 lead in the seventh inning of the sixth game, but allowed the Angels to score six unanswered runs in the seventh and eighth innings to win. The Angels also won Game 7 to win the championship. In 2003, Baker's Cubs led the [[2003 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] 3 games to 1 against the Florida Marlins. The Marlins stormed back to win the final three games of the series, including overcoming a 3-0 Chicago lead with 8 runs in the eighth inning of Game 6. The loss in that game was blamed in part on poor managing, notably leaving starter Mark Prior in the game when he had already thrown over 100 pitches. In 2012, Baker's Reds led the [[2012 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] 2 games to 0 against the San Francisco Giants. With the final three games of the series at home in Cincinnati, the Reds needed to win just once to advance to the National League Championship Series, but the Giants completed the comeback by winning games 3, 4, and 5 and went on to win the World Series. The Reds also suffered a six-game losing streak to end the 2013 season, including a loss in the [[2013 National League Wild Card Game|Wild Card]] game at Pittsburgh. Reds general manager [[Walt Jocketty]] admitted the team's latest collapse played a role in the decision to fire Baker.<ref>{{cite web|url = http://espn.go.com/mlb/story/_/id/9767640/manager-dusty-baker-fired-3-days-cincinnati-reds-ouster|title= Reds dismiss manager Dusty Baker|date=October 4, 2013|work=ESPN|accessdate=October 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Managerial record===\n\n{{updated|games played on October 13, 2017}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" Style=\"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|Team!!rowspan=\"2\"|From!!rowspan=\"2\"|To!!colspan=\"4\"|Regular season record!!colspan=\"4\"|Post\u2013season record\n|-\n!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}!!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}!!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}!!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}!!{{Tooltip|G|Games managed}}!!{{Tooltip|W|Games won}}!!{{Tooltip|L|Games lost}}!!{{Tooltip|Win %|Winning percentage}}\n|-\n|[[San Francisco Giants]]||[[1993 San Francisco Giants season|1993]]||[[2002 San Francisco Giants season|2002]]\n|1555\n|{{WinLossPct|840|715}}\n|24\n|{{WinLossPct|11|13}}\n|-\n|[[Chicago Cubs]]||[[2003 Chicago Cubs season|2003]]||[[2006 Chicago Cubs season|2006]]\n|648\n|{{WinLossPct|322|326}}\n|12\n|{{WinLossPct|6|6}}\n|-\n|[[Cincinnati Reds]]||[[2008 Cincinnati Reds season|2008]]||[[2013 Cincinnati Reds season|2013]]\n|972\n|{{WinLossPct|509|463}}\n|9\n|{{WinLossPct|2|7}}\n|-\n|[[Washington Nationals]]||[[2016 Washington Nationals season|2016]]||[[2017 Washington Nationals season|2017]]\n|324\n|{{WinLossPct|192|132}}\n|10\n|{{WinLossPct|4|6}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"3\"| Total\n!3499\n!{{WinLossPct|1863|1636}}\n!55\n!{{WinLossPct|23|32}}\n|-\n!colspan=\"11\"|{{Tooltip|Ref.|Reference}}:<ref name=\"managerial record\"/>\n|}\n\n==Broadcasting career==\nBaker served as an [[ESPN]] analyst during the 2006 MLB Postseason and served in a similar role during the 2007 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-01-25/sports/0701250142_1_managerial-candidate-giants-and-cubs-nl-central-title |title=Baker's ESPN job has out for managing |date=January 25, 2007 |first=Mark |last=Gonzales |work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/espn-signs-baker-baseball-130138 |title=ESPN signs Baker for baseball |first=Paul J. |last=Gough |date=February 14, 2007 |work=The Hollywood Reporter}}</ref> In 2015, Baker joined [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]] as a studio analyst for the final two weeks of their regular season coverage and for their coverage of the National League playoffs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2015/aa-qa-new-mlb-on-tbs-analyst-dusty-baker-talks-return-to-tv-baseballs-changes-and-more.html|title=AA Q&A: New MLB on TBS Analyst Dusty Baker Talks Return to TV, Baseball's Changes, and More|last1=Bucholtz|first1=Andrew|date=September 17, 2015|website=Awful Announcing|publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBaker was a member of the [[United States Marine Corps Reserve]] from 1969 through 1975.<ref>[http://www.speaking.com/speakers/dustybaker.html Speakers Platform] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219041252/http://www.speaking.com/speakers/dustybaker.html |date=February 19, 2008 }}</ref> Baker has a wife, Melissa, and two children named Natosha (born 1979) and Darren (born 1999).
