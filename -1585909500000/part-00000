He argued that they were responsible for creating the [[wealth]] of a society.  He asserted that the working class physically build bridges, craft furniture, grow food, and nurse children, but do not own land, or [[factories]].{{sfn|Lebowitz|2016}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nA sub-section of the proletariat, the [[lumpenproletariat]] (''rag-proletariat''), are the extremely poor and unemployed, such as [[day labourer]]s and [[homeless]] people. Marx considered them to be devoid of class consciousness.\n\nIn ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that it was the destiny of the working class to displace the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (the rule of the many, as opposed to the \"[[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\"), abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which \"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\" ''The Communist Manifesto'' was a response to Adam Smith's pro capitalist text ''The Wealth of Nations''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adamsmith.org/the-wealth-of-nations|title=The Wealth of Nations|website=Adam Smith Institute|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> ''(''published in 1776)''.'' Some issues in Marxist arguments about working-class membership have included:\n*The class status of people in a temporary or permanent position of [[unemployment]].\n*The class status of [[domestic labour]], particularly the children (see [[child labour]]), and also traditionally the wives of male workers, as some spouses do not themselves work in paying jobs outside the home.\n*Whether workers can be considered working class if they own [[personal property]] or small amounts of stock ownership.\n*The relationships among peasants, rural smallholders, and the working class.\n*The extent to which non-class group identities and politics (race, gender, etc.) can obviate or substitute for working-class membership in Enlightenment projects, where working-class membership is prohibitively contradictory or obfuscated.\n\nPossible responses to some of these issues are:\n*Unemployed workers are proletariat.\n*Class for dependents is determined by the primary income earner.\n*Personal property is argued to be different from [[private property]]. For example, the proletariat can own automobiles; this is personal property.\n*The self-employed worker may be a member of the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'' (for example, a small store owner who controls little capital), or a ''de facto'' member of the proletariat (for example, a contract worker whose income may be relatively high, but is precarious and tied to the need to sell one's labour on the labour market).\n\nIn general, in Marxist terms [[wage slavery|wage labourers]] and those dependent on the [[welfare state]] are working class, and those who live on [[capital accumulation|accumulated capital]] are not. This broad dichotomy defines the [[class struggle]]. Different groups and individuals may at any given time be on one side or the other. Such contradictions of interests and identity within individuals' lives and within communities can effectively undermine the ability of the working class to act in solidarity to reduce [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], inequality, and the role of [[ownership]] in determining people's life chances, work conditions, and political power.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Apprentice]]\n*[[Blue collar]]\n*[[Embourgeoisement thesis]]\n*[[False consciousness]]\n*[[Globalization]]\n*[[Household income in the United States]]\n*[[Industrial novel]]\n*[[Labour movement]]\n*[[Living wage]]\n*[[Minimum wage]]\n*[[Proletarian literature]]\n*[[Proletarian novel]]\n*[[Reserve army of labour]]\n*[[Seebohm Rowntree]], English sociological researcher\n*[[Social mobility]]\n*[[Trade union]]\n*[[Vocational education]]\n*[[Wage slavery]]\n*[[Working class in the United States]]\n*[[Working-class culture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Abendroth\n|first=Wolfgang\n|author-link=Wolfgang Abendroth\n|year=1973\n|title=A Short History of the European Working Class\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Doob\n|first=Christopher B.\n|year=2013\n|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society\n|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey\n|publisher=Pearson Education\n|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|year=1988\n|editor-last=Gutkind\n|editor-first=Peter C.&nbsp;W.\n|title=Third Worlds Workers: Comparative International Labour Studies\n|series=International Studies in Sociology and Social Anthropology\n|volume=49\n|location=Leiden, Netherlands\n|publisher=E.J.

He asserted that the working class physically build bridges, craft furniture, grow food, and nurse children, but do not own land, or [[factories]].{{sfn|Lebowitz|2016}}{{page needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nA sub-section of the proletariat, the [[lumpenproletariat]] (''rag-proletariat''), are the extremely poor and unemployed, such as [[day labourer]]s and [[homeless]] people. Marx considered them to be devoid of class consciousness.\n\nIn ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Karl Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] argued that it was the destiny of the working class to displace the [[capitalism|capitalist]] system, with the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] (the rule of the many, as opposed to the \"[[dictatorship of the bourgeoisie]]\"), abolishing the social relationships underpinning the class system and then developing into a future [[communist]] society in which \"the free development of each is the condition for the free development of all.\" ''The Communist Manifesto'' was a response to Adam Smith's pro capitalist text ''The Wealth of Nations''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adamsmith.org/the-wealth-of-nations|title=The Wealth of Nations|website=Adam Smith Institute|language=en-GB|access-date=2019-05-01}}</ref> ''(''published in 1776)''.'' Some issues in Marxist arguments about working-class membership have included:\n*The class status of people in a temporary or permanent position of [[unemployment]].\n*The class status of [[domestic labour]], particularly the children (see [[child labour]]), and also traditionally the wives of male workers, as some spouses do not themselves work in paying jobs outside the home.\n*Whether workers can be considered working class if they own [[personal property]] or small amounts of stock ownership.\n*The relationships among peasants, rural smallholders, and the working class.\n*The extent to which non-class group identities and politics (race, gender, etc.) can obviate or substitute for working-class membership in Enlightenment projects, where working-class membership is prohibitively contradictory or obfuscated.\n\nPossible responses to some of these issues are:\n*Unemployed workers are proletariat.\n*Class for dependents is determined by the primary income earner.\n*Personal property is argued to be different from [[private property]]. For example, the proletariat can own automobiles; this is personal property.\n*The self-employed worker may be a member of the ''[[petite bourgeoisie]]'' (for example, a small store owner who controls little capital), or a ''de facto'' member of the proletariat (for example, a contract worker whose income may be relatively high, but is precarious and tied to the need to sell one's labour on the labour market).\n\nIn general, in Marxist terms [[wage slavery|wage labourers]] and those dependent on the [[welfare state]] are working class, and those who live on [[capital accumulation|accumulated capital]] are not. This broad dichotomy defines the [[class struggle]]. Different groups and individuals may at any given time be on one side or the other. Such contradictions of interests and identity within individuals' lives and within communities can effectively undermine the ability of the working class to act in solidarity to reduce [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], inequality, and the role of [[ownership]] in determining people's life chances, work conditions, and political power.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Society}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n*[[Apprentice]]\n*[[Blue collar]]\n*[[Embourgeoisement thesis]]\n*[[False consciousness]]\n*[[Globalization]]\n*[[Household income in the United States]]\n*[[Industrial novel]]\n*[[Labour movement]]\n*[[Living wage]]\n*[[Minimum wage]]\n*[[Proletarian literature]]\n*[[Proletarian novel]]\n*[[Reserve army of labour]]\n*[[Seebohm Rowntree]], English sociological researcher\n*[[Social mobility]]\n*[[Trade union]]\n*[[Vocational education]]\n*[[Wage slavery]]\n*[[Working class in the United States]]\n*[[Working-class culture]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n===Footnotes===\n{{reflist|22em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{refbegin|35em|indent=yes}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Abendroth\n|first=Wolfgang\n|author-link=Wolfgang Abendroth\n|year=1973\n|title=A Short History of the European Working Class\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|last=Doob\n|first=Christopher B.\n|year=2013\n|title=Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society\n|location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey\n|publisher=Pearson Education\n|isbn=978-0-205-79241-2\n|ref=harv\n}}\n: {{cite book\n|year=1988\n|editor-last=Gutkind\n|editor-first=Peter C.&nbsp;W.\n|title=Third Worlds Workers: Comparative International Labour Studies\n|series=International Studies in Sociology and Social Anthropology\n|volume=49\n|location=Leiden, Netherlands\n|publisher=E.J.

By default, Player 1 and Player 2 can only play one after another; in the Service Mode though, simultaneous gameplay can be enabled. Along with the ship's primary weapons, the player also has access to three bombs: one that can make a wave of fire that starts from behind the player's ship and scrolls \"up\" the screen, one that makes a powerful circular, nova-like blast, and one that shoots several mini-missiles capable of homing in on multiple targets. The game has six stages.\n\n==Development and release==\n''Viewpoint'' was developed by [[Aicom]] and published by [[Sammy Corporation]] in November 1992. It was one of Sammy's first forays into the video game industry after a lengthy hiatus in the 1980s. It was produced for the [[Neo Geo]] hardware family, specifically the [[Neo Geo (system)|Neo Geo MVS]] arcade system board.\n\n''Viewpoint'' also saw release on a variety of home platforms, including the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[PlayStation (console)|Sony PlayStation]] game consoles, as well as the [[Sharp X68000]] and [[FM Towns]] computer platforms.

The FM Towns platform received the truest-to-arcade port, although it suffers the occasional slowdown.\n\n== Reception ==\n{{Video game reviews\n| Allgame = Arcade: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065514/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=11493&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Neo Geo: 17.5 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Biondich |first=Paul |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-12 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141212065516/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=14204&tab=review |archivedate=December 12, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> Genesis: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Michael |first=Christopher |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-11-16 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116034121/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=12531&tab=review |archivedate=November 16, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> <br /> PS1: 11 / 20<ref>{{cite web |last=Sackenheim |first=Shawn |url=//www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |title=Viewpoint - Review - allgame |website=Web.archive.org |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2016-03-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211012111/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=2346&tab=review |archivedate=December 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n| CVG = Arcade: 95%<ref name=\"CVG\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/225/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| EGM = Genesis: 35 / 50<ref name=\"egm65\"/> <br /> PS1: 30.5 / 40<ref name=\"egm78\"/>\n| Fam = Neo Geo: 30 / 40<ref name=\"Fam\"/>\n| GameFan = Neo Geo: 198.5 / 200<ref name=\"GameFan\"/> <br /> PS1: 233 / 300<ref>''GameFan'', volume 4, issue 1 (January 1996), page 16</ref>\n| GMaster = Neo Geo: 93%<ref>''[[GamesMaster (magazine)|GamesMaster]]'', issue 9 (September 1993), pages 62-63 (published 19 August 1993)</ref> <br /> PS1: 89%<ref name=\"GMasterPS1\">''[[GamesMaster]]'', episode 90 ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dwZdroNphXA&list=PL1F94E85D47458A50 series 5, episode 10]), November 23, 1995</ref>\n| Play = PS1: 74%<ref>''Play'', issue 2 (December 1995), pages 60-61 (published 16 November 1995)</ref>\n| rev1 = ''Maximum''\n| rev1Score = PS1: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"Max2\"/>\n| NGen = Genesis: {{rating|3|5}}<ref name=\"NGen3\"/><br />PS1: {{rating|1|5}}<ref name=\"NGen13\"/>\n| rev3 = ''{{ill|Player One (magazine)|lt=Player One|fr|Player One|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev3Score = Neo Geo: 97%<ref name=\"player1\"/>\n| rev4 = ''[[Sinclair User]]''\n| rev4Score = Arcade: 96%<ref name=\"Sinclair\">{{cite web|url=http://www.solvalou.com/subpage/arcade_reviews/157/385/viewpoint_review.html |title=Viewpoint arcade game review |website=Solvalou.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| rev5 = ''{{ill|Video Games (magazine)|lt=Video Games|de|Video Games|vertical-align=sup}}''\n| rev5Score = Neo Geo: 84%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-12-2634.html |title=Viewpoint (Neo Geo) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> Mega Drive: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-4-746.html |title=Viewpoint (Mega Drive) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref> <br /> PS1: 70%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ninretro.de/game-10-1998.html |title=Viewpoint (PlayStation) - N.i.n.Retro (New is not Retro) v3 |website=Ninretro.de |date= |accessdate=2016-03-11}}</ref>\n| award1Pub = ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]''\n| award1 = Best Graphics in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award2Pub = ''Electronic Gaming Monthly''\n| award2 = Best Music in a Video Game<ref name=\"egmbuyersguide1993\"/>\n| award3Pub = [[GameFan|''GameFan'' Megawards]]\n| award3 = Best Shooter (Genesis)<ref>''GameFan'', volume 3, issue 1 (January 1995), pages 68-75</ref>\n}}\n{{Expand section|date=April 2020}}\nThe Neo Geo version received a positive critical reception.

Ecco 2018 p. xxix,</ref> was one of the primary events in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. There are multiple 16th-century narratives of the events by [[Conquistador|Spanish conquerors]], their indigenous allies, and the defeated [[Aztecs]]. It was not solely a contest between a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the [[Aztec Empire]] but rather the creation of a coalition of Spanish invaders with tributaries to the Aztecs, and most especially the Aztecs' indigenous enemies and rivals. They combined forces to defeat the [[Mexica]] of [[Tenochtitlan]] over a two-year period. For the Spanish, the expedition to Mexico was part of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after twenty-five years of permanent Spanish settlement and further exploration in the Caribbean.\n\nFollowing an earlier expedition led by [[Juan de Grijalva]] to [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n]] in 1518, Spanish settler, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], led an expedition (''entrada'') to Mexico. Two years later, in 1519, Cort\u00e9s and his retinue set sail for Mexico.<ref name=\"spanishwars.net\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanishwars.net/16th-century-conquest-of-the-aztec-empire-partI.html|title=Conquest of the Aztec Empire Part I|website=www.spanishwars.net|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}</ref> The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on 13 August 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcalan]] warriors led by Cort\u00e9s and [[Xicotencatl II|Xicotencatl the Younger]] captured the emperor [[Cuauhtemoc]] and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Aztec Empire]]. The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, and they established their capital of [[Mexico City]] on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.\n\nCort\u00e9s made alliances with tributary city-states (''[[altepetl]]'') of the [[Aztec Empire]] as well as their political rivals, particularly the [[Tlaxcalteca]] and [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcocans]], a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance. Other city-states also joined, including [[Cempoala]] and [[:es:Huejotzinco|Huexotzinco]] and polities bordering [[Lake Texcoco]], the inland lake system of the [[Valley of Mexico]]. Particularly important to the Spanish success was a multilingual (Nahuatl, a Maya dialect, and Spanish) indigenous slave woman, known to the Spanish [[conquistador]]s as Do\u00f1a Marina, and generally as [[La Malinche]]. After eight months of battles and negotiations, which overcame the diplomatic resistance of the Aztec Emperor [[Moctezuma II]] to his visit, Cort\u00e9s arrived in [[Tenochtitlan]] on 8 November 1519, where he took up residence with fellow Spaniards and their indigenous allies. When news reached Cort\u00e9s of the death of several of his men during the Aztec attack on the [[Totonac people|Totonacs]] in [[Veracruz]], Cortes claims that he took Motecuhzoma captive. Capturing the [[cacique]] or indigenous ruler was standard operating procedure for Spaniards in their expansion in the Caribbean, so capturing Motecuhzoma had considerable precedent but modern scholars are skeptical that Cortes and his countrymen took Motecuhzoma captive at this time. They had great incentive to claim they did, owing to the laws of Spain at this time, but critical analysis of their personal writings suggest Motecuhzoma was not taken captive until a much later date.<ref>Townsend, Camilla.

The conquest was well documented by a variety of sources with differing points of view, including indigenous accounts, by both allies and opponents. Accounts by the Spanish conquerors exist from the first landfall at [[Veracruz]], Mexico (on [[Good Friday]], 22 April 1519) to the final victory over the Mexica in Tenochtitlan on 13 August 1521. Notably, the accounts of the conquest, Spanish and indigenous alike, have biases and exaggerations. Some, though not all, Spanish accounts downplay the support of their indigenous allies. Conquerors' accounts exaggerate individual contributions to the Conquest at the expense of their comrades, while indigenous allies' accounts stress their loyalty and importance to victory for the Spanish. These accounts are similar to Spanish conquerors' accounts contained in petitions for rewards, known as ''benem\u00e9rito'' petitions.<ref>Sarah Cline, \"Conquest Narratives,\" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerica'', David Carrasco, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2001, vol. 1, p. 248</ref>\n\nTwo lengthy accounts from the defeated indigenous viewpoint were created under the direction of Spanish friars, Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] and Dominican [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]], using indigenous informants.<ref>Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' chapter 4, \"Narratives of the Conquest.\" Pearson, 2003, pp. 73\u201396</ref>\n\nThe first Spanish account of the conquest was written by lead conqueror [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], who sent a series of letters to the Spanish monarch [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], giving a contemporary account of the conquest from his point of view, in which he justified his actions. These were almost immediately published in Spain and later in other parts of Europe. Much later, Spanish conqueror [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], a well-seasoned participant in the conquest of Central Mexico, wrote what he called [[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a|''The True History of the Conquest of New Spain'']], countering the account by Cort\u00e9s's official biographer, [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]]. Bernal D\u00edaz's account had begun as a ''benem\u00e9rito'' petition for rewards but he expanded it to encompass a full history of his earlier expeditions in the Caribbean and [[Province of Tierra Firme|Tierra Firme]] and the conquest of the Aztec. A number of lower rank Spanish conquerors wrote ''benem\u00e9rito'' petitions to the Spanish Crown, requesting rewards for their services in the conquest, including Juan D\u00edaz, Andr\u00e9s de Tapia, Garc\u00eda del Pilar, and Fray [[Francisco de Aguilar (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguilar]].<ref>Patricia de Fuentes, ed.

Rather than it being a petition for rewards for services, as many Spanish accounts were, the Anonymous Conqueror made observations about the indigenous situation at the time of the conquest. The account was used by eighteenth-century Jesuit [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]] in his descriptions of the history of Mexico.<ref>\"The Cronicle of the Anonymous Conquistador\" in ''The Conquistadors: First-person Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico'' Patricia de Fuente, (editor and trans).

The most important of these are the pictorial [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] and the ''Historia de Tlaxcala'' by [[Diego Mu\u00f1oz Camargo]]. Less successfully, the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] allies from Huexotzinco (or Huejotzinco) near Tlaxcala argued that their contributions had been overlooked by the Spanish. In a letter in [[Nahuatl]] to the Spanish Crown, the indigenous lords of Huexotzinco lay out their case in for their valorous service. The letter has been published in Nahuatl and English translation by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] in ''We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico'' in 1991.<ref>James Lockhart, ''We People Here,'' University of California Press 1991, pp. 289\u201397</ref> Texcoco patriot and member of a noble family there, Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl, likewise petitioned the Spanish Crown, in Spanish, saying that [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] had not received sufficient rewards for their support of the conquistadors, particularly after the Spanish were forced out of Tenochtitlan.<ref>Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitil, ''Ally of Cort\u00e9s: Account 13 of the Coming of the Spaniards and the Beginning of the Evangelical Law.''

Less well-known is [[Sahag\u00fan]]'s 1585 revision of the conquest account, which shifts from the indigenous viewpoint entirely and inserts at crucial junctures passages lauding the Spanish and in particular Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.<ref>Fray Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, ''The Conquest of New Spain, 1585 Revision'' translated by Howard F.

His ''History of the Conquest of Mexico'', first published in 1843, remains an important unified narrative synthesis of the conquest. Prescott read and used all the formal writings from the sixteenth century, although few had been published by the mid-nineteenth century when he was writing. It is likely that a 1585 revision of Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan's account of the conquest survives today only in the form of a copy because it was made in Spain for Prescott's project from a now-lost original.<ref>S.L.

[[Diego Dur\u00e1n]]'s account from indigenous informants.]]\nIn the sources recorded by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] and Dominican [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]] in the mid to late sixteenth century, there are accounts of events that were interpreted as supernatural omens of the conquest. These two accounts are full-blown narratives from the viewpoint of the Spanish opponents. Most first-hand accounts about the conquest of the [[Aztec Empire]] were written by Spaniards: Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s' letters to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and the first-person narrative of [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]''. The primary sources from the native people affected as a result of the conquest are seldom used, because they tend to reflect the views of a particular native group, such as the Tlaxcalans. Indigenous accounts were written in pictographs as early as 1525. Later accounts were written in the native tongue of the Aztec and other native peoples of central Mexico, [[Nahuatl]].\n\nThe native texts of the defeated Mexica narrating their version of the conquest describe eight omens that were believed to have occurred nine years prior to the arrival of the Spanish from the Gulf of Mexico.<ref>Fray Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, ''General History of the Things of New Spain'' (The Florentine Codex).

Nezahualpilli warned Moctezuma that he must be on guard, for in a few years Aztec cities would be destroyed. Before leaving, he said that there would be omens for Moctezuma to know that what he has been told is true.

There were further Spanish explorations and settlements in the Caribbean and the [[Spanish Main]], seeking wealth in the form of gold and access to indigenous labor to mine gold and other manual labor. Twenty-five years after the first Spanish settlement in the [[New World]], expeditions of exploration were sent to the coast of Mexico.\n\n===Early Spanish expeditions to Yucat\u00e1n===\n[[File:DiegoVelazquezCuellar.jpg|thumb|[[Diego Vel\u00e1zquez de Cu\u00e9llar|Diego de Vel\u00e1zquez]], who commissioned Cort\u00e9s's limited expedition of exploration in 1519]]\nIn 1517, Cuban governor Diego Vel\u00e1zquez commissioned a fleet of three ships under the command of [[Francisco Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba (Yucat\u00e1n conquistador)|Hern\u00e1ndez de C\u00f3rdoba]] to sail west and explore the [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n]] peninsula. C\u00f3rdoba reached the coast of Yucat\u00e1n. The [[Mayans]] at Cape Catoche invited the Spanish to land, and the conquistadors read the [[Spanish Requirement of 1513|Requirement of 1513]] to them, which offered the natives the protection of the King of Spain, if they would submit to him. C\u00f3rdoba took two prisoners, who adopted the baptized names of Melchor and Juli\u00e1n and became interpreters.

With the help of tens of thousands of Xiu Mayan warriors, it would take more than 170 years for the Spanish to establish full control of the Maya homelands, which extended from northern Yucat\u00e1n to the central lowlands region of [[El Pet\u00e9n]] and the southern Guatemalan highlands. The end of this latter campaign is generally marked by the downfall of the Maya state based at [[Tayasal]] in the Pet\u00e9n region, in 1697.\n\n=== Cort\u00e9s's expedition ===\n\n==== Commissioning the expedition ====\n[[Image:Hernan Fernando Cortes.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s in his later years; his coat of arms on the upper left corner.

Anyone willing to make a financial contribution could potentially gain even more wealth and power. Men who brought horses, ''caballeros'', received two shares of the spoils, one for military service, another because of the horse.<ref name=\"Ida Altman 2003, p. 54\">Ida Altman, S.L. (Sarah) Cline, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' Pearson, 2003, p. 54</ref> Cort\u00e9s invested a considerable part of his personal fortune and probably went into debt to borrow additional funds. Vel\u00e1zquez may have personally contributed nearly half the cost of the expedition.\n\nIn an agreement signed on 23 October 1518, Governor Vel\u00e1zquez restricted the expedition led by Cort\u00e9s to exploration and trade, so that conquest and settlement of the mainland might occur under his own command, once he had received the permission necessary to do so which he had already requested from the Crown. In this way, Vel\u00e1zquez sought to ensure title to the riches and laborers discovered.<ref>David A. Boruchoff, \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s,\" ''International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences'', 2nd ed. (Detroit: Macmillan, 2008), vol. 2, pp. 146\u201349.</ref> However, armed with the knowledge of Castilian law that he had likely gained as a notary in Valladolid, Cort\u00e9s managed to free himself of Vel\u00e1zquez's authority by presenting Vel\u00e1zquez as a tyrant acting in his own self-interest, and not in the interest of the Crown.<ref>Boruchoff, \"Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.\"</ref> Cort\u00e9s also contrived to have his men name him military leader and chief magistrate (judge) of the expedition.\n\n==== Revoking the commission ====\n[[File:Conquest mexico 1519 21.png|thumb|300px|Map depicting Cort\u00e9s' conquest route]]\nVel\u00e1zquez himself must have been keenly aware that whoever conquered the mainland for Spain would gain fame, glory and fortune to eclipse anything that could be achieved in Cuba. Thus, as the preparations for departure drew to a close, the governor became suspicious that Cort\u00e9s would be disloyal to him and try to commandeer the expedition for his own purposes,<ref>Hassig, Ross, ''Mexico and the Spanish Conquest''. Longman: London and New York, 1994. p. 46.</ref> namely to establish himself as governor of the colony, independent of Vel\u00e1zquez's control.\n\nTherefore, Vel\u00e1zquez sent Luis de Medina with orders to replace Cort\u00e9s. However, Cort\u00e9s's brother-in-law allegedly had Medina intercepted and killed. The papers that Medina had been carrying were sent to Cort\u00e9s. Thus warned, Cort\u00e9s accelerated the organization and preparation of his expedition.<ref>Thomas, Hugh. ''Conquest: Montezuma, Cort\u00e9s, and the fall of Old Mexico'' p. 141</ref>\n\nVel\u00e1zquez arrived at the dock in [[Santiago de Cuba]] in person, \"he and Cort\u00e9s again embraced, with a great exchange of compliments\", before Cortes set sail for [[Trinidad, Cuba]]. Vel\u00e1zquez then sent orders for the fleet to be held and Cort\u00e9s taken prisoner. Nevertheless, Cort\u00e9s set sail, beginning his expedition with the legal status of a [[mutiny|mutineer]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|49, 51, 55\u201356}}\n\nCort\u00e9s's contingent consisted of 11 ships carrying about 630 men (including 30 crossbowmen and 12 [[arquebusiers]], an early form of firearm), a doctor, several carpenters, at least eight women, a few hundred [[Arawak]]s from Cuba and some Africans, both freedmen and slaves. Although modern usage often calls the European participants \"soldiers\", the term was never used by these men themselves in any context, something that [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] realized when analyzing sixteenth-century legal records from conquest-era Peru.<ref>James Lockhart, ''Spanish Peru, 1532\u20131560.'', Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1968.</ref>\n\n==== Cort\u00e9s gains two translators ====\nCort\u00e9s spent some time at the island of [[Cozumel]], on the east coast of Yucat\u00e1n, trying to convert the locals to Christianity, something that provided mixed results. While at Cozumel, Cort\u00e9s heard reports of other white men living in the Yucat\u00e1n. Cort\u00e9s sent messengers to these reported Spaniards, who turned out to be the survivors of a Spanish shipwreck that had occurred in 1511, [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]] and [[Gonzalo Guerrero]].\n\nAguilar petitioned his Maya chieftain to be allowed to join his former countrymen, and he was released and made his way to Cort\u00e9s's ships. \nNow quite fluent in [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya]], as well as some other [[Mesoamerican languages|indigenous languages]], proved to be a valuable asset for Cort\u00e9s as a translator \u2013 a skill of particular significance to the later conquest of the Aztec Empire that was to be the end result of Cort\u00e9s's expedition. According to Bernal D\u00edaz, Aguilar relayed that before coming, he had attempted to convince Guerrero to leave as well. Guerrero declined on the basis that he was by now well-assimilated with the Maya culture, had a Maya wife and three children, and he was looked upon as a figure of rank within the Maya settlement of [[Chetumal]], where he lived.<ref>Guerrero is reported to have responded, ''\"Brother Aguilar, I am married and have three children, and they look at me as a Cacique here, and a captain in time of war [...] But my face is tattooed and my ears are pierced. What would the Spaniards say if they saw me like this? And look how handsome these children of mine are!\"'' (p. 60)</ref> Although Guerrero's later fate is somewhat uncertain, it appears that for some years he continued to fight alongside the Maya forces against Spanish incursions, providing military counsel and encouraging resistance; it is speculated that he may have been killed in a later battle.\n[[Image:Codex azcatitlan222.jpg|thumb|300px |left|[[Codex Azcatitlan]] depicting the Spanish-Tlaxcalan army, with Cort\u00e9s and La Malinche, along with an African slave in front the meeting with Moctezuma. The facing page is no longer extant.]]\n\nAfter leaving Cozumel, Cort\u00e9s continued round the tip of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula and landed at [[Potonch\u00e1n]], where there was little gold. After defeating the local natives in two battles, discovered a far more valuable asset in the form of a woman whom Cort\u00e9s would have christened Marina. She is often known as [[La Malinche]] and also sometimes called \"[[Malintzin]]\" or Malinalli, her native birth names. Later, the Aztecs would come to call Cort\u00e9s \"Malintzin\" or La Malinche by dint of his close association with her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortese/cortese_b00.html |title=Conquistadors \u2013 Cort\u00e9s |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] wrote in his account ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]'' that Marina was \"truly a great princess.\" Later, the honorific Spanish title of Do\u00f1a would be added to her baptized name.<ref name=\"Diaz\"/>{{rp|80, 82}}\n\nCort\u00e9s had stumbled upon one of the keys to realizing his ambitions. He would speak to [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]] in Spanish who would then translate into Mayan for Marina. She would then translate from Mayan to Nahuatl. With this pair of translators, Cort\u00e9s could now communicate to the Aztecs.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|86\u201387}} How effectively is still a matter of speculation, since Marina did not speak the dialect of the Aztecs, nor was she familiar with the protocols of the Aztec nobility, who were renowned for their flowery, flattering talk. Do\u00f1a Marina quickly learned Spanish, and became Cort\u00e9s's primary interpreter, confidant, consort, cultural translator, and the mother of his first son, Martin.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|82}} Until Cortes's marriage to his second wife, a union which produced a legitimate son whom he also named Martin, Cort\u00e9s's natural son with Marina was the heir of his envisaged fortunes.\n\nNative speakers of Nahuatl would call her \"Malintzin\". This name is the closest approximation possible in Nahuatl to the sound of Spanish ''Marina''. Over time, \"[[La Malinche]]\" (the modern Spanish cognate of ''Malintzin'') became a term for a traitor to one's people. To this day, the word ''[[malinchista]]'' is used by Mexicans to denote one who apes the language and customs of another country.<ref>[[Frances Karttunen|Karttunen, Frances]]. \"Malinche and Malinchismo\" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 777-78.

During this same period, soon after he arrived, Cort\u00e9s was welcomed by representatives of the Aztec Emperor, Moctezuma II. Gifts were exchanged, and Cort\u00e9s attempted to frighten the Aztec delegation with a display of his firepower.<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|26}}<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|89\u201391}}\n\nFaced with imprisonment or death for defying the governor, Cort\u00e9s' only alternative was to continue his enterprise in the hope of redeeming himself with the Spanish Crown. To do this, he directed his men to establish a settlement called [[Veracruz (city)|La Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz]], or \"True Cross\", since they arrived on [[Maundy Thursday]] and landed on [[Good Friday]]. The legally constituted \"[[regidor|town council]] of Villa Rica\" then promptly offered him the position of [[adelantado]], or Chief Justice and Captain-General.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|102}}\n\nThis strategy was not unique.<ref>See: Restall, Matthew. Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest. Oxford University Press: Oxford and New York, 2003.</ref> Vel\u00e1squez had used this same legal mechanism to free himself from [[Diego Columbus]]' authority in Cuba. In being named ''adelantado'' by a duly constituted [[cabildo (council)|cabildo]], Cort\u00e9s was able to free himself from Vel\u00e1squez's authority and continue his expedition. To ensure the legality of this action, several members of his expedition, including [[Francisco Montejo]] and [[Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero]], returned to Spain to seek acceptance of the cabildo's declaration with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|127\u201328}}\n\nCort\u00e9s learned of an indigenous settlement called [[Cempoala]] and marched his forces there. On their arrival in Cempoala, they were greeted by 20 dignitaries and cheering townsfolk.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|88, 107}} Cort\u00e9s quickly persuaded the [[Totonac]] chiefs to rebel against the Aztecs, taking prisoner five of Moctezuma's tax collectors.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|111\u201313}} The Totonacs also helped Cort\u00e9s build the town of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, which was the starting point for his attempt to conquer the Aztec Empire.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|114}}\n\nHearing of the rebellion, more ambassadors from the Aztec Emperor returned to see Cort\u00e9s, bearing gifts of \"gold and cloth\", in thankfulness for Cort\u00e9s freeing his tax collectors. Montezuma also told Cort\u00e9s, he was certain the Spanish were of \"his own race\", and had arrived as \"his ancestors had foretold\". As Cort\u00e9s told his men, the natives \"think of us as gods, or godlike beings.\"<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|13, 21, 25, 33, 35}}<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|115\u201317}}\n\nAlthough they attempted to dissuade Cort\u00e9s from visiting Tenochtitlan, the lavish gifts and the polite, welcoming remarks only encouraged ''El [[Caudillo]]'' to continue his march towards the capital of the empire.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|96, 166}}\n\n==== Scuttling the fleet and aftermath ====\n[[File:ScuttleFleetNHMDF.JPG|thumb|left|Cort\u00e9s scuttling fleet off Veracruz coast]]\nMen still loyal to the governor of Cuba planned to seize a ship and escape to Cuba, but Cort\u00e9s moved swiftly to squash their plans. Two leaders were condemned to be hanged; two were lashed, and one had his foot mutilated. To make sure such a mutiny did not happen again, he decided to [[scuttling|scuttle]] his ships.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|128\u201330}}\n\nThere is a popular misconception that the ships were burned rather than sunk. This misconception has been attributed to the reference made by [[Cervantes de Salaz\u00e1r]] in 1546, as to Cort\u00e9s burning his ships.<ref>Matthew Restall, \"Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest\", 2003</ref> This may have also come from a mis-translation of the version of the story written in Latin.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html Cort\u00e9s Burns His Boats] pbs.org</ref>\n\nWith all of his ships scuttled, Cort\u00e9s effectively stranded the expedition in central Mexico. However, it did not completely end the aspirations of those members of his company who remained loyal to the governor of Cuba. Cort\u00e9s then led his band inland towards Tenochtitlan.\n\nIn addition to the Spaniards, Cort\u00e9s force now included 40 Cempoalan warrior chiefs and at least 200 other natives whose task was to drag the cannon and carry supplies.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|134}} The Cempoalans were accustomed to the hot climate of the coast, but they suffered immensely from the cold of the mountains, the rain, and the hail as they marched towards Tenochtitlan.\n\n==== Alliance with Tlaxcala ====\n[[File:Xicotencatl-Cortes.jpg|thumb|Meeting of Cort\u00e9s and Xicotencatl]]\nCort\u00e9s soon arrived at [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]], a confederacy of about 200 towns and different tribes, but without central government.\n\nThe [[Otomi people|Otomi]] initially, and then the [[Tlaxcalans]] fought the Spanish in a series of three battles from 2 to 5 September 1519, and at one point Diaz remarked, \"they surrounded us on every side\". After Cort\u00e9s continued to release prisoners with messages of peace, and realizing the Spanish were enemies of Montezuma, [[Xicotencatl the Elder]], and [[Maxixcatzin]], persuaded the Tlaxcalan warleader, [[Xicotencatl the Younger]], that it would be better to ally with the newcomers than to kill them.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|143\u201355, 171}}\n\nThe Tlaxcalans' main city was Tlaxcala. After almost a century of fighting the [[Flower Wars]], a great deal of hatred and bitterness had developed between the Tlaxcalans and the Aztecs. The Aztecs had already conquered most of the territory around Tlaxcala, and waged war on them every year.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|154}} It has been suggested that the Aztecs left Tlaxcala independent so that they would have a constant supply of war captives to sacrifice to their gods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html |title=Conquistadors \u2013 Cort\u00e9s |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 September 1519, Cort\u00e9s arrived in Tlaxcala and was greeted with joy by the rulers, who saw the Spanish as an ally against the Aztecs. Due to a commercial blockade by the Aztecs, Tlaxcala was poor, lacking, among other things, salt and cotton cloths, so they could only offer Cort\u00e9s and his men food and slaves. Cort\u00e9s stayed twenty days in Tlaxcala, giving his men time to recover from their wounds from the battles. Cort\u00e9s seems to have won the true friendship and loyalty of the senior leaders of Tlaxcala, among them [[Maxixcatzin]] and [[Xicotencatl the Elder]], although he could not win the heart of [[Xicotencatl the Younger]]. The Spaniards agreed to respect parts of the city, like the temples, and reportedly took only the things that were offered to them freely.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|172\u201374}}\n\nAs before with other native groups, Cort\u00e9s preached to the Tlaxcalan leaders about the benefits of Christianity. The ''Caciques'' gave Cortes \"the most beautiful of their daughters and nieces\". Xicotencatl the Elder's daughter was baptized as Do\u00f1a Luisa, and Maxixcatzin's daughter as Do\u00f1a Elvira. They were given by Cort\u00e9s to [[Pedro de Alvarado]] and [[Juan Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n]] respectively.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|176\u201378}}\n\nLegends say that he convinced the four leaders of Tlaxcala to become baptized. Maxixcatzin, Xicotencatl the Elder, Citalpopocatzin and Temiloltecutl received the names of Don Lorenzo, Don Vicente, Don Bartolom\u00e9 and Don Gonzalo. It is impossible to know if these leaders understood the Catholic faith. In any case, they apparently had no problems in adding the Christian \"Dios\" ([[God]] in Spanish), the lord of the heavens, to their already complex [[Aztec mythology|pantheon of gods]]. An exchange of gifts was made and thus began the highly significant and effective alliance between Cort\u00e9s and Tlaxcala.<ref>Hugh Tomas, ''The conquest of Mexico'', 1994</ref>\n\n==== Cort\u00e9s marches to Cholula ====\nMeanwhile, Moctezuma's ambassadors, who had been in the Spanish camp after the battles with the Tlaxcalans, continued to press Cort\u00e9s to take the road to Mexico via [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], which was under Aztec control, rather than over [[:es:Huejoztinco|Huexotzinco]], which was an ally of Tlaxcala. They were surprised Cort\u00e9s had stayed in [[Tlaxcala]] so long \"among a poor and ill-bred people\".<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|166, 185\u201386}}\n\nCholula was one of the most important cities of Mesoamerica, the second largest, and probably the most sacred.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Its huge pyramid (larger in volume than the great pyramids of Egypt)<ref name=Evans>{{cite book|last=Evans|first=Susan Toby|title=Archaeology of ancient Mexico and Central America, an Encyclopedia|year=2001|publisher=Garland Publishing, Inc|location=New York & London|pages=139\u201341}}</ref> made it one of the most prestigious places of the [[Aztec religion]]. However, it appears that Cort\u00e9s perceived Cholula more as a military threat to his rear guard than a religious center, as he marched to Tenochtitlan.

[[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] had apparently decided to resist with force the advance of Cort\u00e9s and his troops, and it seems that Moctezuma ordered the leaders of Cholula to try to stop the Spanish. Cholula had a very small army, because as a sacred city they put their confidence in their prestige and their gods. According to the chronicles of the Tlaxcalteca, the priests of Cholula expected to use the power of Quetzalcoatl, their primary god, against the invaders.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|193, 199}}\n\nCort\u00e9s and his men entered Cholula without active resistance.

Cort\u00e9s confronted the city leaders in the main temple alleging that they were planning to attack his men. They admitted that they had been ordered to resist by Moctezuma, but they claimed they had not followed his orders. Regardless, on command, the Spaniards seized and killed many of the local nobles to serve as a lesson.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|199}}\n\nThey captured the Cholulan leaders [[Tlaquiach]] and [[Tlalchiac]] and then ordered the city to be set on fire. The troops started in the palace of [[Xacayatzin]], and then on to [[Chialinco]] and [[Yetzcoloc]]. In letters to his King, Cort\u00e9s claimed that in three hours time his troops (helped by the Tlaxcalans) killed 3,000 people and had burned the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/16325/y-conq.html |title=Empires Past: Aztecs: Conquest |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |accessdate=2010-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202061155/http://library.thinkquest.org/16325/y-conq.html |archive-date=2 February 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Another witness, V\u00e1zquez de Tapia, claimed the death toll was as high as 30,000.

The Spanish's situation could only deteriorate. Because the Aztecs had removed the bridges over the gaps in the causeways that linked the city to the surrounding lands, Cort\u00e9s' men constructed a portable bridge to cross the water of the lake. On the rainy night of 10 July 1520, the Spaniards and their allies set out for the mainland via the causeway to [[Tlacopan]]. They placed the portable bridge in the first gap, but at that moment their movement was detected and Aztec forces attacked, both along the causeway and by means of canoes on the lake.

The Spanish discovered that they could not remove their portable bridge unit from the first gap, and so had no choice but to leave it behind. The bulk of the Spanish infantry, left behind by Cort\u00e9s and the other horsemen, had to cut their way through the masses of Aztec warriors opposing them. Many of the Spaniards, weighed down by their armor and booty, drowned in the causeway gaps or were killed by the Aztecs. Much of the wealth the Spaniards had acquired in Tenochtitlan was lost.

Although hard-pressed, the Spanish infantry was able to hold off the overwhelming numbers of enemy warriors, while the Spanish cavalry under the leadership of Cort\u00e9s charged through the enemy ranks again and again.

During the battle, the defenders cut the beating hearts from seventy Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli, an act that infuriated the Spaniards.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|386\u201387, 391, 401\u201303}}\n\nCort\u00e9s then ordered the idols of the Aztec gods in the temples to be taken down and replaced with icons of Christianity. He also announced that the temple would never again be used for human sacrifice. Human sacrifice and reports of cannibalism, common among the natives of the Aztec Empire, had been a major reason motivating Cort\u00e9s and encouraging his soldiers to avoid surrender while fighting to the death.<ref name=Diaz/>\n\nTenochtitlan had been almost totally destroyed using the manpower of the Tlaxcalans plus fire and cannon fire during the siege, and once it finally fell, the Spanish continued its destruction, as they soon began to establish the foundations of what would become [[History of Mexico City|Mexico City]] on the site. The surviving Aztec people were forbidden to live in Tenochtitlan and the surrounding isles, and were banished to live in Tlatelolco.\n\n==Further Spanish Wars of Conquest ==\n===Michoacan===\n{{Main|Tarascan state|Tangaxuan II}}\n[[File:Aztec Indians Mexico Tlaxcalan Cortez.jpg|thumb|[[Nu\u00f1o de Guzm\u00e1n]], a rival of [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s|Cort\u00e9s]], led Spanish soldiers with [[Tlaxcala]]n allies in the conquest of Michoacan.]]\nAfter hearing about the fall of the [[Aztec Empire]], Tarascan ruler (''Cazonci'') [[Tangaxuan II]] sent emissaries to the Spanish victors (the [[Tarascan state]] was contemporary with and an enemy of the [[Aztec Empire]]). A few Spaniards went with them to [[Tzintzuntzan (Mesoamerican site)|Tzintzuntzan]] where they were presented to the ruler and gifts were exchanged. They returned with samples of gold and Cort\u00e9s' interest in the Tarascan state was awakened.\n\nIn 1522 a Spanish force under the leadership of [[Cristobal de Olid]] was sent into Tarascan territory and arrived at Tzintzuntzan within days. The Tarascan army numbered many thousands, perhaps as many as 100,000, but at the crucial moment they chose not to fight.<ref>Gorenstein (1993, xiv).</ref> Tang\u00e1xuan submitted to the Spanish administration, but for his cooperation was allowed a large degree of autonomy. This resulted in a strange arrangement where both Cort\u00e9s and Tang\u00e1xuan considered themselves rulers of Michoac\u00e1n for the following years: the population of the area paid tribute to them both.\n\n[[Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n]], then president of the first Audiencia decided, to march on northwestern Mexico with a force of 5,000\u20138,000 men in search for new populations to subdue, and when he arrived in [[Michoac\u00e1n]] and found out that Tangaxuan was still ''de facto'' ruler of his empire he allied himself with a Tarascan noble Don Pedro Panza ''Cuinier\u00e1ngari'' against the ''Cazonci''. The ''Cazonci'' was tried with plotting a rebellion, withholding tribute, sodomy and heresy, and he was tortured and executed.<ref>Gorenstein (1993, xv).  According to some other sources Tangaxuan II was dragged behind a horse and then burned.</ref> His ashes were thrown into the [[Lerma river]]. A period of violence and turbulence began. During the next decades, Tarascan puppet rulers were installed by the Spanish government.\n\n===Conquest of the Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula===\n{{Main|Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n}}\nThe [[Spanish conquest of Yucat\u00e1n]] took almost 170 years.

The glyph to the right of his head represents his [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] name, ''Tonatiuh'' (\"Sun\").]]\nAfter the Spanish conquest of central Mexico, expeditions were sent further northward in Mesoamerica, to the region known as [[La Gran Chichimeca]]. The expeditions under [[Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n]] were particularly harsh on the [[Chichimeca]] population, causing them to rebel under the leadership of [[Tenamaxtli]] and thus launch the '''[[Mixton War]]'''.\n\nIn 1540, the Chichimecas fortified [[Mixt\u00f3n]], [[Nochistl\u00e1n]], and other mountain towns then besieged the Spanish settlement in [[Guadalajara]]. The famous conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]], coming to the aid of acting governor [[Crist\u00f3bal de O\u00f1ate]], led an attack on Nochistl\u00e1n. However, the Chichimecas counter-attacked and Alvarado's forces were routed. Under the leadership of Viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], the Spanish forces and their Indian allies ultimately succeeded in recapturing the towns and suppressing resistance. However, fighting did not completely come to a halt in the ensuing years.\n\nIn 1546, Spanish authorities discovered silver in the [[Zacatecas]] region and established mining settlements in Chichimeca territory which altered the terrain and the Chichimeca traditional way of life. The Chichimeca resisted the intrusions on their ancestral lands by attacking travelers and merchants along the \"silver roads.\" The ensuing [[Chichimeca War]] (1550\u20131590) would become the longest and costliest conflict between Spanish forces and indigenous peoples in the Americas. The attacks intensified with each passing year. In 1554, the Chichimecas inflicted a great loss upon the Spanish when they attacked a train of sixty wagons and captured more than 30,000 pesos worth of valuables. By the 1580s, thousands had died and Spanish mining settlements in Chichimeca territory were continually under threat. In 1585, Don Alvaro Manrique de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Marquis of Villamanrique, was appointed viceroy. The viceroy was infuriated when he learned that some Spanish soldiers had begun supplementing their incomes by raiding the villages of peaceful Indians in order to sell them into slavery. With no military end to the conflict in sight, he was determined to restore peace to that region and launched a full-scale peace offensive by negotiating with Chichimeca leaders and providing them with lands, agricultural supplies, and other goods. This policy of \"peace by purchase\" finally brought an end to the Chichimeca War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somosprimos.com/schmal/schmal.htm |title=John P.

In 1535, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (who was as the King of Spain known as Charles I), named the Spanish nobleman Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] the first Viceroy of [[New Spain]]. Mendoza was entirely loyal to the Spanish crown, unlike the conqueror of Mexico [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], who had demonstrated that he was independent-minded and defied official orders when he threw off the authority of Governor Vel\u00e1zquez in Cuba. The name \"[[New Spain]]\" had been suggested by Cort\u00e9s and was later confirmed officially by Mendoza.\n\nThe Aztec Empire ceased to exist with the Spanish final conquest of Tenochtitlan in August 1521. The empire had been composed of separate city-states that had either allied with or been conquered by the Mexica of Tenochtitlan, and rendered tribute to the Mexica while maintaining their internal ruling structures. Those polities now came under Spanish rule, also retaining their internal structures of ruling elites, tribute paying commoners, and land holding and other economic structures largely intact. Two key works by historian [[Charles Gibson]], ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' (1952)<ref>[[Charles Gibson]], ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'', New Haven: Yale University Press 1952</ref> and his monograph ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519\u20131810'' (1964)<ref>[[Charles Gibson]], ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico'', 1519\u20131810, Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964.</ref> were central in reshaping the historiography of the indigenous and their communities from the Spanish Conquest to the 1810 Mexican independence era.<ref>Review by Benjamin Keen in ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' Vol. 45, No. 3 (Aug. 1965), pp. 477\u201380</ref>\n\nScholars who were part of a branch of [[Mesoamerican]] [[ethnohistory]], more recently called the [[New Philology]] have, using indigenous texts in the indigenous languages, been able to examine in considerable detail how the indigenous lived during the era of Spanish colonial rule. A major work that utilizes colonial-era indigenous texts as its main source is [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]]'s ''The Nahuas After the Conquest: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.''<ref>[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], ''The Nahuas After the Conquest: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology,'' Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref> The key to understanding how considerable continuity of pre-Conquest indigenous structures was possible was the Spanish colonial utilization of the indigenous nobility. In the colonial era, the indigenous nobility were largely recognized as nobles by the Spanish colonial regime, with privileges including the noble Spanish title ''don'' for noblemen and ''do\u00f1a'' for noblewomen. To this day, the title of Duke of Moctezuma is held by a Spanish noble family. A few of the indigenous nobility learned Spanish. Spanish friars taught indigenous tribes to write their own languages in Latin letters, which soon became a self-perpetuating tradition at the local level.<ref>[[Frances Karttunen]], \"Aztec Literacy,\" in George A. Coller et al., eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States'', pp. 395\u2013417. New York: Academic Press 1982.</ref> Their surviving writings are crucial in our knowledge of colonial era [[Nahuas]].\n\nThe first [[mendicants]] in central Mexico, particularly the Franciscans and Dominicans learned the indigenous language of [[Nahuatl]], in order to evangelize to the indigenous people in their native tongue. Early mendicants created texts in order to forward the project of Christianization. Particularly important were the 1571 Spanish-Nahuatl dictionary compiled by the Franciscan Fray [[Alonso de Molina]],<ref>Fray Alonso de Molina, ''Vocabulario en lengua cstellana y mexicana y mexcana y castellana''(1571), Mexico: Editorial Porr\u00faa, 1970</ref> and his 1569 bilingual Nahuatl-Spanish confessional manual for priests.<ref>Fray Alonso de Molina, ''Confessionario mayor en la lengua castellana y mexicana'' (1569), With an introduction by Roberto Moreno. Mexico: Instituto de Investigaciones Filol\u00f3gicos, Instituto de Investigaciones Hist\u00f3ricos, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico.</ref> A major project by the Franciscans in Mexico was the compilation of knowledge on Nahua religious beliefs and culture that friar [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] oversaw using indigenous informants, resulting in a number of important texts and culminating in a 12 volume text, ''The General History of the Things of New Spain'' published in English as the [[Florentine Codex]]. The Spanish crown via the [[Council of the Indies]] and the Franciscan order in the late sixteenth century became increasingly hostile to works in the indigenous languages written by priests and clerics, concerned that they were heretical and an impediment to the Indians' true conversion.<ref>Howard F. Cline, \"Evolution of the Historia General\" in ''Handbook of Middle American Indians'', ''Guide to Ethnohistorical Sources'', vol. 13, part 2, Howard F. Cline, volume editor, Austin: University of Texas Pres, 1973 p. 196.</ref>\n\nTo reward Spaniards who participated in the conquest of what is now contemporary Mexico, the Spanish crown authorized grants of native labor, in particular the assignment of entire indigenous communities to labor via the [[Encomienda]] system. The indigenous were not slaves under this system, chattel bought and sold or removed from their home community, but the system was still one of forced labor. The indigenous people of Central Mexico had practices rendering labor and tribute products to their polity's elites and those elites to the Mexica overlords in Tenochtitlan, so the Spanish system of encomienda was built on pre-existing patterns of labor service.\n\nThe Spanish conquerors in Mexico during the early colonial era lived off the labor of the indigenous peoples. Due to some horrifying instances of abuse against the native peoples, Bishop [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] suggested importing black slaves to replace them. Las Casas later repented when he saw the even worse treatment given to the black slaves.<ref>Blackburn 1997: 136; Friede 1971: 165\u201366</ref>\n\n[[File:Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, Calle 69 n53 -Av.6, Venustiano Carranza, Federal District, Mexico08.jpg|thumb|left|Evangelization of Mexico]]\nThe other discovery that perpetuated this system of indigenous forced labor were the extensive silver mines discovered at [[Potos\u00ed|Potosi]], in Higher Peru (now Bolivia) and other places in the Spanish empire in the New World that were worked for hundreds of years by forced native labor and contributed most of the wealth that flowed to Spain.\n\nAccording to West, \"slavery was a well-established institution among the Aztecs and their neighbors.\" \"During the Conquest, Spaniards legally enslaved large numbers of natives \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 as booty of warfare, branding each individual on the cheek.\" In fact, \"Cortes owned several hundred, used mainly in [[placer mining|gold placering]].\" Indian slavery was abolished in 1542 but persisted until the 1550s.<ref name=\"Bakewell\">{{cite book|author=West, Robert.

The [[Manila Galleon]] brought in far more silver direct from South American mines to China than the overland Silk Road, or even European trade routes in the Indian Ocean could.\n\nThe Aztec education system was abolished and replaced by a very limited church education. Even some foods associated with Mesoamerican religious practice, such as [[amaranth]], were forbidden.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Catholic missionaries campaigned against cultural traditions of the Aztecs, and the use of [[Psilocybin mushroom|psilocybin mushrooms]], like other pre-Christian traditions, was quickly suppressed.

As a result of these unions, as well as concubinage {{citation needed|date=August 2011}} and secret mistresses, mixed race individuals known as [[mestizo]]s became the majority of the Mexican population in the centuries following the Spanish conquest.\n\n==Cultural depictions of the Aztecs==\n[[File:Lorenzo Ferrero - Scene from the opera La Conquista.jpg|thumb|230px|Scene from the opera ''[[La Conquista (opera)|La Conquista]]'', 2005]]\nThe Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire is the subject of an opera, ''[[La Conquista (opera)|La Conquista]]'' (2005) and of a set of six symphonic poems, ''[[La Nueva Espa\u00f1a (composition)|La Nueva Espa\u00f1a]]'' (1992\u201399) by Italian composer [[Lorenzo Ferrero]].\n\nCort\u00e9s's conquest has been depicted in numerous television documentaries.

the Aztec Empire''', also known as the '''Conquest of Mexico''' or the '''Spanish\u2013Mexican War''' (1519\u201321),<ref>[[Matthew Restall|Restall, Matthew]], ''When Montezuma Met Cort\u00e9s''. Ecco 2018 p. xxix,</ref> was one of the primary events in the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]]. There are multiple 16th-century narratives of the events by [[Conquistador|Spanish conquerors]], their indigenous allies, and the defeated [[Aztecs]]. It was not solely a contest between a small contingent of Spaniards defeating the [[Aztec Empire]] but rather the creation of a coalition of Spanish invaders with tributaries to the Aztecs, and most especially the Aztecs' indigenous enemies and rivals. They combined forces to defeat the [[Mexica]] of [[Tenochtitlan]] over a two-year period. For the Spanish, the expedition to Mexico was part of a project of Spanish colonization of the New World after twenty-five years of permanent Spanish settlement and further exploration in the Caribbean.\n\nFollowing an earlier expedition led by [[Juan de Grijalva]] to [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula|Yucat\u00e1n]] in 1518, Spanish settler, [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], led an expedition (''entrada'') to Mexico. Two years later, in 1519, Cort\u00e9s and his retinue set sail for Mexico.<ref name=\"spanishwars.net\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.spanishwars.net/16th-century-conquest-of-the-aztec-empire-partI.html|title=Conquest of the Aztec Empire Part I|website=www.spanishwars.net|language=en|access-date=2017-05-06}}</ref> The Spanish campaign against the Aztec Empire had its final victory on 13 August 1521, when a coalition army of Spanish forces and native [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcalan]] warriors led by Cort\u00e9s and [[Xicotencatl II|Xicotencatl the Younger]] captured the emperor [[Cuauhtemoc]] and Tenochtitlan, the capital of the [[Aztec Triple Alliance|Aztec Empire]]. The fall of Tenochtitlan marks the beginning of Spanish rule in central Mexico, and they established their capital of [[Mexico City]] on the ruins of Tenochtitlan.\n\nCort\u00e9s made alliances with tributary city-states (''[[altepetl]]'') of the [[Aztec Empire]] as well as their political rivals, particularly the [[Tlaxcalteca]] and [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcocans]], a former partner in the Aztec Triple Alliance. Other city-states also joined, including [[Cempoala]] and [[:es:Huejotzinco|Huexotzinco]] and polities bordering [[Lake Texcoco]], the inland lake system of the [[Valley of Mexico]]. Particularly important to the Spanish success was a multilingual (Nahuatl, a Maya dialect, and Spanish) indigenous slave woman, known to the Spanish [[conquistador]]s as Do\u00f1a Marina, and generally as [[La Malinche]]. After eight months of battles and negotiations, which overcame the diplomatic resistance of the Aztec Emperor [[Moctezuma II]] to his visit, Cort\u00e9s arrived in [[Tenochtitlan]] on 8 November 1519, where he took up residence with fellow Spaniards and their indigenous allies. When news reached Cort\u00e9s of the death of several of his men during the Aztec attack on the [[Totonac people|Totonacs]] in [[Veracruz]], Cortes claims that he took Motecuhzoma captive. Capturing the [[cacique]] or indigenous ruler was standard operating procedure for Spaniards in their expansion in the Caribbean, so capturing Motecuhzoma had considerable precedent but modern scholars are skeptical that Cortes and his countrymen took Motecuhzoma captive at this time. They had great incentive to claim they did, owing to the laws of Spain at this time, but critical analysis of their personal writings suggest Motecuhzoma was not taken captive until a much later date.<ref>Townsend, Camilla. Malintzin's Choices: An Indian Woman in the Conquest of Mexico. p. 92</ref> \n\nWhen Cort\u00e9s left Tenochtitlan to return to the coast and deal with the expedition of [[P\u00e1nfilo de Narv\u00e1ez]], sent to rein in Cort\u00e9s's expedition that had exceeded its specified limits, Cort\u00e9s's right-hand man [[Pedro de Alvarado]] was left in charge. Alvarado allowed a significant Aztec feast to be celebrated in Tenochtitlan and on the pattern of the earlier massacre in Cholula, closed off the square and [[Massacre in the Great Temple of Tenochtitlan|massacred the celebrating Aztec noblemen]]. The official biography of Cort\u00e9s by [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]] contains a description of the massacre.<ref>Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara, ''Cort\u00e9s: The Life of the Conqueror by His Secretary,'' Berkeley: University of California Press 1964, pp. 207\u201308.</ref> The Alvarado massacre at the Main Temple of [[Tenochtitlan]] precipitated rebellion by the population of the city.

A whole generation of Spaniards later participated in expeditions in the Caribbean and Tierra Firme (Central America), learning strategy and tactics of successful enterprises. The Spanish conquest of Mexico had antecedents with established practices.<ref>Lockhart and Schwartz, ''Early Latin America'' (1983).

The conquest was well documented by a variety of sources with differing points of view, including indigenous accounts, by both allies and opponents. Accounts by the Spanish conquerors exist from the first landfall at [[Veracruz]], Mexico (on [[Good Friday]], 22 April 1519) to the final victory over the Mexica in Tenochtitlan on 13 August 1521. Notably, the accounts of the conquest, Spanish and indigenous alike, have biases and exaggerations. Some, though not all, Spanish accounts downplay the support of their indigenous allies. Conquerors' accounts exaggerate individual contributions to the Conquest at the expense of their comrades, while indigenous allies' accounts stress their loyalty and importance to victory for the Spanish. These accounts are similar to Spanish conquerors' accounts contained in petitions for rewards, known as ''benem\u00e9rito'' petitions.<ref>Sarah Cline, \"Conquest Narratives,\" in ''The Oxford Encyclopedia of Mesoamerica'', David Carrasco, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2001, vol. 1, p. 248</ref>\n\nTwo lengthy accounts from the defeated indigenous viewpoint were created under the direction of Spanish friars, Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] and Dominican [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]], using indigenous informants.<ref>Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, and Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico,'' chapter 4, \"Narratives of the Conquest.\" Pearson, 2003, pp. 73\u201396</ref>\n\nThe first Spanish account of the conquest was written by lead conqueror [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], who sent a series of letters to the Spanish monarch [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], giving a contemporary account of the conquest from his point of view, in which he justified his actions. These were almost immediately published in Spain and later in other parts of Europe. Much later, Spanish conqueror [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], a well-seasoned participant in the conquest of Central Mexico, wrote what he called [[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a|''The True History of the Conquest of New Spain'']], countering the account by Cort\u00e9s's official biographer, [[Francisco L\u00f3pez de G\u00f3mara]]. Bernal D\u00edaz's account had begun as a ''benem\u00e9rito'' petition for rewards but he expanded it to encompass a full history of his earlier expeditions in the Caribbean and [[Province of Tierra Firme|Tierra Firme]] and the conquest of the Aztec. A number of lower rank Spanish conquerors wrote ''benem\u00e9rito'' petitions to the Spanish Crown, requesting rewards for their services in the conquest, including Juan D\u00edaz, Andr\u00e9s de Tapia, Garc\u00eda del Pilar, and Fray [[Francisco de Aguilar (conquistador)|Francisco de Aguilar]].<ref>Patricia de Fuentes, ed.

Rather than it being a petition for rewards for services, as many Spanish accounts were, the Anonymous Conqueror made observations about the indigenous situation at the time of the conquest. The account was used by eighteenth-century Jesuit [[Francisco Javier Clavijero]] in his descriptions of the history of Mexico.<ref>\"The Cronicle of the Anonymous Conquistador\" in ''The Conquistadors: First-person Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico'' Patricia de Fuente, (editor and trans).

The most important of these are the pictorial [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] and the ''Historia de Tlaxcala'' by [[Diego Mu\u00f1oz Camargo]]. Less successfully, the [[Nahua peoples|Nahua]] allies from Huexotzinco (or Huejotzinco) near Tlaxcala argued that their contributions had been overlooked by the Spanish. In a letter in [[Nahuatl]] to the Spanish Crown, the indigenous lords of Huexotzinco lay out their case in for their valorous service. The letter has been published in Nahuatl and English translation by [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] in ''We People Here: Nahuatl Accounts of the Conquest of Mexico'' in 1991.<ref>James Lockhart, ''We People Here,'' University of California Press 1991, pp. 289\u201397</ref> Texcoco patriot and member of a noble family there, Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitl, likewise petitioned the Spanish Crown, in Spanish, saying that [[Texcoco (altepetl)|Texcoco]] had not received sufficient rewards for their support of the conquistadors, particularly after the Spanish were forced out of Tenochtitlan.<ref>Fernando Alva Ixtlilxochitil, ''Ally of Cort\u00e9s: Account 13 of the Coming of the Spaniards and the Beginning of the Evangelical Law.''

Less well-known is [[Sahag\u00fan]]'s 1585 revision of the conquest account, which shifts from the indigenous viewpoint entirely and inserts at crucial junctures passages lauding the Spanish and in particular Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s.<ref>Fray Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, ''The Conquest of New Spain, 1585 Revision'' translated by Howard F.

His ''History of the Conquest of Mexico'', first published in 1843, remains an important unified narrative synthesis of the conquest. Prescott read and used all the formal writings from the sixteenth century, although few had been published by the mid-nineteenth century when he was writing. It is likely that a 1585 revision of Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan's account of the conquest survives today only in the form of a copy because it was made in Spain for Prescott's project from a now-lost original.<ref>S.L.

[[Diego Dur\u00e1n]]'s account from indigenous informants.]]\nIn the sources recorded by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] and Dominican [[Diego Dur\u00e1n]] in the mid to late sixteenth century, there are accounts of events that were interpreted as supernatural omens of the conquest. These two accounts are full-blown narratives from the viewpoint of the Spanish opponents. Most first-hand accounts about the conquest of the [[Aztec Empire]] were written by Spaniards: Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s' letters to [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor]] and the first-person narrative of [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]], ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]''. The primary sources from the native people affected as a result of the conquest are seldom used, because they tend to reflect the views of a particular native group, such as the Tlaxcalans. Indigenous accounts were written in pictographs as early as 1525. Later accounts were written in the native tongue of the Aztec and other native peoples of central Mexico, [[Nahuatl]].\n\nThe native texts of the defeated Mexica narrating their version of the conquest describe eight omens that were believed to have occurred nine years prior to the arrival of the Spanish from the Gulf of Mexico.<ref>Fray Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan, ''General History of the Things of New Spain'' (The Florentine Codex).

Salt Lake City: University of Utah Press.</ref>\n\nIn 1510, Aztec Emperor Moctezuma II was visited by [[Nezahualpilli]], who had a reputation as a great seer, as well as being the ''tlatoani'' of Texcoco. Nezahualpilli warned Moctezuma that he must be on guard, for in a few years Aztec cities would be destroyed. Before leaving, he said that there would be omens for Moctezuma to know that what he has been told is true. Over the years, and especially after Nezhualpilli's death in 1515, several supernatural omens appeared.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|title=Moctezuma: Warlord of the Aztecs|last=Tsouras|first=Peter|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2005|isbn=|location=Washington, DC|pages=}}</ref>\n\nThe eight bad omens or wonders:<ref name=\"Miguel\" />{{rp|3\u201311}}\n[[File:Aztec Empire c 1519.png|thumb|300 px|Aztec empire on the eve of the Spanish Invasion]]\n\n# A column of fire that appeared from midnight until dawn, and seemed to rain fire in the year 1517 (12-House)\n# Fire consuming the temple of [[Huitzilopochtli]]\n# A lightning bolt destroying the straw temple of [[Xiuhtecuhtli]]\n# The appearance of fire, or comets, streaming across the sky in threes during the day\n# The \"boiling deep ,\" and water flooding, of a lake nearby Tenochtitlan\n# A woman, [[Cihuatcoatl]], weeping in the middle of the night for them (the Aztecs) to \"flee far away from this city\"\n# Montezuma II saw the stars of [[Taurus (constellation)|''mamalhuatztli]], and images of fighting men riding \"on the backs of animals resembling deer\", in a mirror on the crown of a bird caught by fishermen\n#  A two headed man, ''tlacantzolli'', running through the streets\n\nAdditionally, the [[Tlaxcala]] saw a \"radiance that shone in the east every morning three hours before sunrise\", and a \"whirlwind of dust\" from the volcano [[Matlalcueitl (volcano)|Matlalcueye]].<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|11}} According to Diaz, \"These ''Caciques'' also told us of a tradition they had heard from their ancestors, that one of the idols which they particularly worshipped had prophesied the coming of men from distant lands in the direction of the sunrise, who would conquer them and rule them.\"<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|181}} Some accounts would claim that this idol, or deity was Quetzalcoatl, and that the Aztecs were defeated because they believed the Spanish were supernatural and didn't know how to react, although whether or not the Aztecs really believed that is debatable.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=The Atlantic World|last=Egerton|first=Douglas R. |display-authors=etal |publisher=Harlan Davidson, Inc.|year=2007|isbn=978-0-88295-245-1|location=Wheeling, Illinois|pages=97}}</ref>\n\nOmens were extremely important to the Aztecs, who believed that history repeated itself.

This means that native emphasis on omens and bewilderment in the face of invasion \"may be a postconquest interpretation by informants who wished to please the Spaniards or who resented the failure of Montezuma and of the warriors of Tenochtitlan to provide leadership.\"<ref>Schwartz, Stuart B., ed.

With the help of tens of thousands of Xiu Mayan warriors, it would take more than 170 years for the Spanish to establish full control of the Maya homelands, which extended from northern Yucat\u00e1n to the central lowlands region of [[El Pet\u00e9n]] and the southern Guatemalan highlands.

Although modern usage often calls the European participants \"soldiers\", the term was never used by these men themselves in any context, something that [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]] realized when analyzing sixteenth-century legal records from conquest-era Peru.<ref>James Lockhart, ''Spanish Peru, 1532\u20131560.'', Madison: University of Wisconsin Press 1968.</ref>\n\n==== Cort\u00e9s gains two translators ====\nCort\u00e9s spent some time at the island of [[Cozumel]], on the east coast of Yucat\u00e1n, trying to convert the locals to Christianity, something that provided mixed results. While at Cozumel, Cort\u00e9s heard reports of other white men living in the Yucat\u00e1n. Cort\u00e9s sent messengers to these reported Spaniards, who turned out to be the survivors of a Spanish shipwreck that had occurred in 1511, [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]] and [[Gonzalo Guerrero]].\n\nAguilar petitioned his Maya chieftain to be allowed to join his former countrymen, and he was released and made his way to Cort\u00e9s's ships. \nNow quite fluent in [[Yucatec Maya language|Maya]], as well as some other [[Mesoamerican languages|indigenous languages]], proved to be a valuable asset for Cort\u00e9s as a translator \u2013 a skill of particular significance to the later conquest of the Aztec Empire that was to be the end result of Cort\u00e9s's expedition. According to Bernal D\u00edaz, Aguilar relayed that before coming, he had attempted to convince Guerrero to leave as well. Guerrero declined on the basis that he was by now well-assimilated with the Maya culture, had a Maya wife and three children, and he was looked upon as a figure of rank within the Maya settlement of [[Chetumal]], where he lived.<ref>Guerrero is reported to have responded, ''\"Brother Aguilar, I am married and have three children, and they look at me as a Cacique here, and a captain in time of war [...] But my face is tattooed and my ears are pierced. What would the Spaniards say if they saw me like this? And look how handsome these children of mine are!\"'' (p. 60)</ref> Although Guerrero's later fate is somewhat uncertain, it appears that for some years he continued to fight alongside the Maya forces against Spanish incursions, providing military counsel and encouraging resistance; it is speculated that he may have been killed in a later battle.\n[[Image:Codex azcatitlan222.jpg|thumb|300px |left|[[Codex Azcatitlan]] depicting the Spanish-Tlaxcalan army, with Cort\u00e9s and La Malinche, along with an African slave in front the meeting with Moctezuma.

After defeating the local natives in two battles, discovered a far more valuable asset in the form of a woman whom Cort\u00e9s would have christened Marina. She is often known as [[La Malinche]] and also sometimes called \"[[Malintzin]]\" or Malinalli, her native birth names. Later, the Aztecs would come to call Cort\u00e9s \"Malintzin\" or La Malinche by dint of his close association with her.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortese/cortese_b00.html |title=Conquistadors \u2013 Cort\u00e9s |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref> [[Bernal D\u00edaz del Castillo]] wrote in his account ''[[Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva Espa\u00f1a|The True History of the Conquest of New Spain]]'' that Marina was \"truly a great princess.\" Later, the honorific Spanish title of Do\u00f1a would be added to her baptized name.<ref name=\"Diaz\"/>{{rp|80, 82}}\n\nCort\u00e9s had stumbled upon one of the keys to realizing his ambitions. He would speak to [[Ger\u00f3nimo de Aguilar]] in Spanish who would then translate into Mayan for Marina. She would then translate from Mayan to Nahuatl. With this pair of translators, Cort\u00e9s could now communicate to the Aztecs.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|86\u201387}} How effectively is still a matter of speculation, since Marina did not speak the dialect of the Aztecs, nor was she familiar with the protocols of the Aztec nobility, who were renowned for their flowery, flattering talk. Do\u00f1a Marina quickly learned Spanish, and became Cort\u00e9s's primary interpreter, confidant, consort, cultural translator, and the mother of his first son, Martin.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|82}} Until Cortes's marriage to his second wife, a union which produced a legitimate son whom he also named Martin, Cort\u00e9s's natural son with Marina was the heir of his envisaged fortunes.\n\nNative speakers of Nahuatl would call her \"Malintzin\". This name is the closest approximation possible in Nahuatl to the sound of Spanish ''Marina''.

During this same period, soon after he arrived, Cort\u00e9s was welcomed by representatives of the Aztec Emperor, Moctezuma II. Gifts were exchanged, and Cort\u00e9s attempted to frighten the Aztec delegation with a display of his firepower.<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|26}}<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|89\u201391}}\n\nFaced with imprisonment or death for defying the governor, Cort\u00e9s' only alternative was to continue his enterprise in the hope of redeeming himself with the Spanish Crown. To do this, he directed his men to establish a settlement called [[Veracruz (city)|La Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz]], or \"True Cross\", since they arrived on [[Maundy Thursday]] and landed on [[Good Friday]]. The legally constituted \"[[regidor|town council]] of Villa Rica\" then promptly offered him the position of [[adelantado]], or Chief Justice and Captain-General.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|102}}\n\nThis strategy was not unique.<ref>See: Restall, Matthew. Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest. Oxford University Press: Oxford and New York, 2003.</ref> Vel\u00e1squez had used this same legal mechanism to free himself from [[Diego Columbus]]' authority in Cuba. In being named ''adelantado'' by a duly constituted [[cabildo (council)|cabildo]], Cort\u00e9s was able to free himself from Vel\u00e1squez's authority and continue his expedition. To ensure the legality of this action, several members of his expedition, including [[Francisco Montejo]] and [[Alonso Hernandez Puertocarrero]], returned to Spain to seek acceptance of the cabildo's declaration with [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles]].<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|127\u201328}}\n\nCort\u00e9s learned of an indigenous settlement called [[Cempoala]] and marched his forces there. On their arrival in Cempoala, they were greeted by 20 dignitaries and cheering townsfolk.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|88, 107}} Cort\u00e9s quickly persuaded the [[Totonac]] chiefs to rebel against the Aztecs, taking prisoner five of Moctezuma's tax collectors.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|111\u201313}} The Totonacs also helped Cort\u00e9s build the town of Villa Rica de la Vera Cruz, which was the starting point for his attempt to conquer the Aztec Empire.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|114}}\n\nHearing of the rebellion, more ambassadors from the Aztec Emperor returned to see Cort\u00e9s, bearing gifts of \"gold and cloth\", in thankfulness for Cort\u00e9s freeing his tax collectors. Montezuma also told Cort\u00e9s, he was certain the Spanish were of \"his own race\", and had arrived as \"his ancestors had foretold\". As Cort\u00e9s told his men, the natives \"think of us as gods, or godlike beings.\"<ref name=Miguel/>{{rp|13, 21, 25, 33, 35}}<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|115\u201317}}\n\nAlthough they attempted to dissuade Cort\u00e9s from visiting Tenochtitlan, the lavish gifts and the polite, welcoming remarks only encouraged ''El [[Caudillo]]'' to continue his march towards the capital of the empire.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|96, 166}}\n\n==== Scuttling the fleet and aftermath ====\n[[File:ScuttleFleetNHMDF.JPG|thumb|left|Cort\u00e9s scuttling fleet off Veracruz coast]]\nMen still loyal to the governor of Cuba planned to seize a ship and escape to Cuba, but Cort\u00e9s moved swiftly to squash their plans. Two leaders were condemned to be hanged; two were lashed, and one had his foot mutilated. To make sure such a mutiny did not happen again, he decided to [[scuttling|scuttle]] his ships.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|128\u201330}}\n\nThere is a popular misconception that the ships were burned rather than sunk. This misconception has been attributed to the reference made by [[Cervantes de Salaz\u00e1r]] in 1546, as to Cort\u00e9s burning his ships.<ref>Matthew Restall, \"Seven Myths of the Spanish Conquest\", 2003</ref> This may have also come from a mis-translation of the version of the story written in Latin.<ref>[https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html Cort\u00e9s Burns His Boats] pbs.org</ref>\n\nWith all of his ships scuttled, Cort\u00e9s effectively stranded the expedition in central Mexico. However, it did not completely end the aspirations of those members of his company who remained loyal to the governor of Cuba. Cort\u00e9s then led his band inland towards Tenochtitlan.\n\nIn addition to the Spaniards, Cort\u00e9s force now included 40 Cempoalan warrior chiefs and at least 200 other natives whose task was to drag the cannon and carry supplies.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|134}} The Cempoalans were accustomed to the hot climate of the coast, but they suffered immensely from the cold of the mountains, the rain, and the hail as they marched towards Tenochtitlan.\n\n==== Alliance with Tlaxcala ====\n[[File:Xicotencatl-Cortes.jpg|thumb|Meeting of Cort\u00e9s and Xicotencatl]]\nCort\u00e9s soon arrived at [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala]], a confederacy of about 200 towns and different tribes, but without central government.\n\nThe [[Otomi people|Otomi]] initially, and then the [[Tlaxcalans]] fought the Spanish in a series of three battles from 2 to 5 September 1519, and at one point Diaz remarked, \"they surrounded us on every side\". After Cort\u00e9s continued to release prisoners with messages of peace, and realizing the Spanish were enemies of Montezuma, [[Xicotencatl the Elder]], and [[Maxixcatzin]], persuaded the Tlaxcalan warleader, [[Xicotencatl the Younger]], that it would be better to ally with the newcomers than to kill them.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|143\u201355, 171}}\n\nThe Tlaxcalans' main city was Tlaxcala. After almost a century of fighting the [[Flower Wars]], a great deal of hatred and bitterness had developed between the Tlaxcalans and the Aztecs. The Aztecs had already conquered most of the territory around Tlaxcala, and waged war on them every year.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|154}} It has been suggested that the Aztecs left Tlaxcala independent so that they would have a constant supply of war captives to sacrifice to their gods.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/conquistadors/cortes/cortes_d00.html |title=Conquistadors \u2013 Cort\u00e9s |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-31}}</ref>\n\nOn 23 September 1519, Cort\u00e9s arrived in Tlaxcala and was greeted with joy by the rulers, who saw the Spanish as an ally against the Aztecs. Due to a commercial blockade by the Aztecs, Tlaxcala was poor, lacking, among other things, salt and cotton cloths, so they could only offer Cort\u00e9s and his men food and slaves. Cort\u00e9s stayed twenty days in Tlaxcala, giving his men time to recover from their wounds from the battles. Cort\u00e9s seems to have won the true friendship and loyalty of the senior leaders of Tlaxcala, among them [[Maxixcatzin]] and [[Xicotencatl the Elder]], although he could not win the heart of [[Xicotencatl the Younger]]. The Spaniards agreed to respect parts of the city, like the temples, and reportedly took only the things that were offered to them freely.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|172\u201374}}\n\nAs before with other native groups, Cort\u00e9s preached to the Tlaxcalan leaders about the benefits of Christianity. The ''Caciques'' gave Cortes \"the most beautiful of their daughters and nieces\". Xicotencatl the Elder's daughter was baptized as Do\u00f1a Luisa, and Maxixcatzin's daughter as Do\u00f1a Elvira. They were given by Cort\u00e9s to [[Pedro de Alvarado]] and [[Juan Vel\u00e1zquez de Le\u00f3n]] respectively.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|176\u201378}}\n\nLegends say that he convinced the four leaders of Tlaxcala to become baptized. Maxixcatzin, Xicotencatl the Elder, Citalpopocatzin and Temiloltecutl received the names of Don Lorenzo, Don Vicente, Don Bartolom\u00e9 and Don Gonzalo. It is impossible to know if these leaders understood the Catholic faith. In any case, they apparently had no problems in adding the Christian \"Dios\" ([[God]] in Spanish), the lord of the heavens, to their already complex [[Aztec mythology|pantheon of gods]]. An exchange of gifts was made and thus began the highly significant and effective alliance between Cort\u00e9s and Tlaxcala.<ref>Hugh Tomas, ''The conquest of Mexico'', 1994</ref>\n\n==== Cort\u00e9s marches to Cholula ====\nMeanwhile, Moctezuma's ambassadors, who had been in the Spanish camp after the battles with the Tlaxcalans, continued to press Cort\u00e9s to take the road to Mexico via [[Cholula (Mesoamerican site)|Cholula]], which was under Aztec control, rather than over [[:es:Huejoztinco|Huexotzinco]], which was an ally of Tlaxcala.

However, it appears that Cort\u00e9s perceived Cholula more as a military threat to his rear guard than a religious center, as he marched to Tenochtitlan. He sent emissaries ahead to try a diplomatic solution to enter the city.\n\nCort\u00e9s, who had not yet decided to start a war with the Aztec Empire, decided to offer a compromise. He accepted the gifts of the Aztec ambassadors, and at the same time accepted the offer of the Tlaxcalan allies to provide porters and 1000 warriors on his march to Cholula. He also sent two men, [[Pedro de Alvarado]], and [[:es:Bernardino V\u00e1zquez de Tapia|Bernardino V\u00e1zquez de Tapia]], directly to Tenochtitlan, as ambassadors and to scout for an appropriate route.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|186\u201388}}\n\n==== Massacre of Cholula ====\n[[File:Matanza de Cholula por conquistadores espa\u00f1oles Lienzo de Tlaxcala.jpg|thumb|The massacre of Cholula.

[[Moctezuma II|Moctezuma]] had apparently decided to resist with force the advance of Cort\u00e9s and his troops, and it seems that Moctezuma ordered the leaders of Cholula to try to stop the Spanish. Cholula had a very small army, because as a sacred city they put their confidence in their prestige and their gods. According to the chronicles of the Tlaxcalteca, the priests of Cholula expected to use the power of Quetzalcoatl, their primary god, against the invaders.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|193, 199}}\n\nCort\u00e9s and his men entered Cholula without active resistance.

Cort\u00e9s confronted the city leaders in the main temple alleging that they were planning to attack his men. They admitted that they had been ordered to resist by Moctezuma, but they claimed they had not followed his orders. Regardless, on command, the Spaniards seized and killed many of the local nobles to serve as a lesson.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|199}}\n\nThey captured the Cholulan leaders [[Tlaquiach]] and [[Tlalchiac]] and then ordered the city to be set on fire. The troops started in the palace of [[Xacayatzin]], and then on to [[Chialinco]] and [[Yetzcoloc]]. In letters to his King, Cort\u00e9s claimed that in three hours time his troops (helped by the Tlaxcalans) killed 3,000 people and had burned the city.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://library.thinkquest.org/16325/y-conq.html |title=Empires Past: Aztecs: Conquest |publisher=Library.thinkquest.org |accessdate=2010-10-31 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202061155/http://library.thinkquest.org/16325/y-conq.html |archive-date=2 February 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref> Another witness, V\u00e1zquez de Tapia, claimed the death toll was as high as 30,000.

This alliance had many victories, including the overtaking of the Aztec Capital [[Tenochtitlan]]. Their capital was used as a cosmic center, where they fed [[Human sacrifice in Aztec culture|sacrifices]] to the gods through both human bodies and bloodletting. The capital was also used for central and imperialistic governmental control. Preparations for war began in their capital.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Memories of Conquest: Becoming Mexicano in Colonial Guatemala|last=Matthew|first=Laura E.|publisher=University of North Carolina Press|year=2012|isbn=978-1-4696-0179-3|location=|pages=}}</ref> The Spanish and their allies, including the Tlaxcala, had to flee the central city, as the people of Tenochtitlan had risen against them. The Spanish's situation could only deteriorate. Because the Aztecs had removed the bridges over the gaps in the causeways that linked the city to the surrounding lands, Cort\u00e9s' men constructed a portable bridge to cross the water of the lake. On the rainy night of 10 July 1520, the Spaniards and their allies set out for the mainland via the causeway to [[Tlacopan]]. They placed the portable bridge in the first gap, but at that moment their movement was detected and Aztec forces attacked, both along the causeway and by means of canoes on the lake. The Spanish were thus caught on a narrow road with water or buildings on both sides.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|297\u201399, 305}}\n\nThe retreat quickly turned into a rout. The Spanish discovered that they could not remove their portable bridge unit from the first gap, and so had no choice but to leave it behind. The bulk of the Spanish infantry, left behind by Cort\u00e9s and the other horsemen, had to cut their way through the masses of Aztec warriors opposing them. Many of the Spaniards, weighed down by their armor and booty, drowned in the causeway gaps or were killed by the Aztecs. Much of the wealth the Spaniards had acquired in Tenochtitlan was lost. The bridge was later called \"Alvarado's Leap\".<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|299\u2013300, 306}}\n\nThe channel is now a street in Mexico City, called \"[[Puente de Alvarado]]\" (Alvarado's Bridge), because it seemed Alvarado escaped across an invisible bridge.

This episode is called \"[[La Noche Triste]]\" (The Night of Sorrows), and the old tree (\"El \u00e1rbol de la noche triste\") where Cort\u00e9s allegedly cried, is still a monument in Mexico City.\n\nThe Aztecs pursued and harassed the Spanish, who, guided by their Tlaxcalan allies, moved around Lake [[Zumpango]] towards a sanctuary in Tlaxcala. On 14 July 1520, the Aztecs attempted to destroy the Spanish for good at the [[Battle of Otumba]]. Although hard-pressed, the Spanish infantry was able to hold off the overwhelming numbers of enemy warriors, while the Spanish cavalry under the leadership of Cort\u00e9s charged through the enemy ranks again and again.

The siege of the city and its defense had both been brutal. Largely because he wanted to present the city to his king and emperor, Cort\u00e9s had made several attempts to end the siege through diplomacy, but all offers were rejected. During the battle, the defenders cut the beating hearts from seventy Spanish prisoners-of-war at the altar to Huitzilopochtli, an act that infuriated the Spaniards.<ref name=Diaz/>{{rp|386\u201387, 391, 401\u201303}}\n\nCort\u00e9s then ordered the idols of the Aztec gods in the temples to be taken down and replaced with icons of Christianity. He also announced that the temple would never again be used for human sacrifice.

The expeditions under [[Nu\u00f1o Beltr\u00e1n de Guzm\u00e1n]] were particularly harsh on the [[Chichimeca]] population, causing them to rebel under the leadership of [[Tenamaxtli]] and thus launch the '''[[Mixton War]]'''.\n\nIn 1540, the Chichimecas fortified [[Mixt\u00f3n]], [[Nochistl\u00e1n]], and other mountain towns then besieged the Spanish settlement in [[Guadalajara]]. The famous conquistador [[Pedro de Alvarado]], coming to the aid of acting governor [[Crist\u00f3bal de O\u00f1ate]], led an attack on Nochistl\u00e1n. However, the Chichimecas counter-attacked and Alvarado's forces were routed. Under the leadership of Viceroy Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], the Spanish forces and their Indian allies ultimately succeeded in recapturing the towns and suppressing resistance. However, fighting did not completely come to a halt in the ensuing years.\n\nIn 1546, Spanish authorities discovered silver in the [[Zacatecas]] region and established mining settlements in Chichimeca territory which altered the terrain and the Chichimeca traditional way of life. The Chichimeca resisted the intrusions on their ancestral lands by attacking travelers and merchants along the \"silver roads.\" The ensuing [[Chichimeca War]] (1550\u20131590) would become the longest and costliest conflict between Spanish forces and indigenous peoples in the Americas. The attacks intensified with each passing year. In 1554, the Chichimecas inflicted a great loss upon the Spanish when they attacked a train of sixty wagons and captured more than 30,000 pesos worth of valuables. By the 1580s, thousands had died and Spanish mining settlements in Chichimeca territory were continually under threat. In 1585, Don Alvaro Manrique de Z\u00fa\u00f1iga, Marquis of Villamanrique, was appointed viceroy. The viceroy was infuriated when he learned that some Spanish soldiers had begun supplementing their incomes by raiding the villages of peaceful Indians in order to sell them into slavery. With no military end to the conflict in sight, he was determined to restore peace to that region and launched a full-scale peace offensive by negotiating with Chichimeca leaders and providing them with lands, agricultural supplies, and other goods. This policy of \"peace by purchase\" finally brought an end to the Chichimeca War.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.somosprimos.com/schmal/schmal.htm |title=John P.

In 1535, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] (who was as the King of Spain known as Charles I), named the Spanish nobleman Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]] the first Viceroy of [[New Spain]]. Mendoza was entirely loyal to the Spanish crown, unlike the conqueror of Mexico [[Hern\u00e1n Cort\u00e9s]], who had demonstrated that he was independent-minded and defied official orders when he threw off the authority of Governor Vel\u00e1zquez in Cuba. The name \"[[New Spain]]\" had been suggested by Cort\u00e9s and was later confirmed officially by Mendoza.\n\nThe Aztec Empire ceased to exist with the Spanish final conquest of Tenochtitlan in August 1521. The empire had been composed of separate city-states that had either allied with or been conquered by the Mexica of Tenochtitlan, and rendered tribute to the Mexica while maintaining their internal ruling structures. Those polities now came under Spanish rule, also retaining their internal structures of ruling elites, tribute paying commoners, and land holding and other economic structures largely intact. Two key works by historian [[Charles Gibson]], ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'' (1952)<ref>[[Charles Gibson]], ''Tlaxcala in the Sixteenth Century'', New Haven: Yale University Press 1952</ref> and his monograph ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico, 1519\u20131810'' (1964)<ref>[[Charles Gibson]], ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule: A History of the Indians of the Valley of Mexico'', 1519\u20131810, Stanford: Stanford University Press 1964.</ref> were central in reshaping the historiography of the indigenous and their communities from the Spanish Conquest to the 1810 Mexican independence era.<ref>Review by Benjamin Keen in ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' Vol. 45, No. 3 (Aug. 1965), pp. 477\u201380</ref>\n\nScholars who were part of a branch of [[Mesoamerican]] [[ethnohistory]], more recently called the [[New Philology]] have, using indigenous texts in the indigenous languages, been able to examine in considerable detail how the indigenous lived during the era of Spanish colonial rule. A major work that utilizes colonial-era indigenous texts as its main source is [[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]]'s ''The Nahuas After the Conquest: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology.''<ref>[[James Lockhart (historian)|James Lockhart]], ''The Nahuas After the Conquest: Postconquest Central Mexican History and Philology,'' Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref> The key to understanding how considerable continuity of pre-Conquest indigenous structures was possible was the Spanish colonial utilization of the indigenous nobility. In the colonial era, the indigenous nobility were largely recognized as nobles by the Spanish colonial regime, with privileges including the noble Spanish title ''don'' for noblemen and ''do\u00f1a'' for noblewomen. To this day, the title of Duke of Moctezuma is held by a Spanish noble family. A few of the indigenous nobility learned Spanish. Spanish friars taught indigenous tribes to write their own languages in Latin letters, which soon became a self-perpetuating tradition at the local level.<ref>[[Frances Karttunen]], \"Aztec Literacy,\" in George A. Coller et al., eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States'', pp. 395\u2013417. New York: Academic Press 1982.</ref> Their surviving writings are crucial in our knowledge of colonial era [[Nahuas]].\n\nThe first [[mendicants]] in central Mexico, particularly the Franciscans and Dominicans learned the indigenous language of [[Nahuatl]], in order to evangelize to the indigenous people in their native tongue. Early mendicants created texts in order to forward the project of Christianization. Particularly important were the 1571 Spanish-Nahuatl dictionary compiled by the Franciscan Fray [[Alonso de Molina]],<ref>Fray Alonso de Molina, ''Vocabulario en lengua cstellana y mexicana y mexcana y castellana''(1571), Mexico: Editorial Porr\u00faa, 1970</ref> and his 1569 bilingual Nahuatl-Spanish confessional manual for priests.<ref>Fray Alonso de Molina, ''Confessionario mayor en la lengua castellana y mexicana'' (1569), With an introduction by Roberto Moreno. Mexico: Instituto de Investigaciones Filol\u00f3gicos, Instituto de Investigaciones Hist\u00f3ricos, Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico.</ref> A major project by the Franciscans in Mexico was the compilation of knowledge on Nahua religious beliefs and culture that friar [[Bernardino de Sahag\u00fan]] oversaw using indigenous informants, resulting in a number of important texts and culminating in a 12 volume text, ''The General History of the Things of New Spain'' published in English as the [[Florentine Codex]]. The Spanish crown via the [[Council of the Indies]] and the Franciscan order in the late sixteenth century became increasingly hostile to works in the indigenous languages written by priests and clerics, concerned that they were heretical and an impediment to the Indians' true conversion.<ref>Howard F.

The indigenous were not slaves under this system, chattel bought and sold or removed from their home community, but the system was still one of forced labor. The indigenous people of Central Mexico had practices rendering labor and tribute products to their polity's elites and those elites to the Mexica overlords in Tenochtitlan, so the Spanish system of encomienda was built on pre-existing patterns of labor service.\n\nThe Spanish conquerors in Mexico during the early colonial era lived off the labor of the indigenous peoples. Due to some horrifying instances of abuse against the native peoples, Bishop [[Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas]] suggested importing black slaves to replace them. Las Casas later repented when he saw the even worse treatment given to the black slaves.<ref>Blackburn 1997: 136; Friede 1971: 165\u201366</ref>\n\n[[File:Our Lady of Guadalupe Church, Calle 69 n53 -Av.6, Venustiano Carranza, Federal District, Mexico08.jpg|thumb|left|Evangelization of Mexico]]\nThe other discovery that perpetuated this system of indigenous forced labor were the extensive silver mines discovered at [[Potos\u00ed|Potosi]], in Higher Peru (now Bolivia) and other places in the Spanish empire in the New World that were worked for hundreds of years by forced native labor and contributed most of the wealth that flowed to Spain.\n\nAccording to West, \"slavery was a well-established institution among the Aztecs and their neighbors.\" \"During the Conquest, Spaniards legally enslaved large numbers of natives \u2013 men, women and children \u2013 as booty of warfare, branding each individual on the cheek.\" In fact, \"Cortes owned several hundred, used mainly in [[placer mining|gold placering]].\" Indian slavery was abolished in 1542 but persisted until the 1550s.<ref name=\"Bakewell\">{{cite book|author=West, Robert.

He told his father, the king of the Kekaya Kingdom about this. His father asked Kekaya Dynasty's royal priest about the childless life of his son. The royal priest told that the royal family should serve the Sages who were living in Rishi Varsha and which was surrounded by Aryavartha or Aryavarsha and Sthreevarsha. The King of Kekaya and Ashwapati went to Rishi Varsha to serve the Rishis. One of the sage was pleased with the service of the King and the prince of Kekaya. He prayed to Lord Surya to bless the prince with children. Lord Surya appeared and blessed Ashwapati with a son and a daughter. His wife became pregnant and twins were born to them at Arkakshetra. The rishi named the boy Yudhajit and the girl Kaikeyi. The king of Kekaya Kingdom spent a few years with his grandchildren and died due to illness. After the death of the King, Ashwapati became the King of Kekaya Kingdom, Yudhajit became the prince of Kekaya Kingdom and Kaikeyi became the princess of Kekaya Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ramanan50.wordpress.com/2017/02/17/kaikeyi-born-in-russia-world-during-ramayana-part-3/|title=Kaikeyi Born In Russia World During Ramayana Part 3|first=|last=ramanan50|date=17 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Dasharatha give Payasa to his wives.jpg|thumb|250px|Dasharatha gives Payasa to his wives]]\n\n==Relations==\nKaikeyi's nature and her relationships are quite revealing in Ayodhya Kand of Valmiki Ramayan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valmikiramayan.net/|website=Valmiki Ramayana|accessdate=12 June 2017|title=Valmiki Ramayana}}</ref> Kaikeyi maintained strong relations with her maternal family even after her wedding to King Dasharath. Her brother Yudhajit visits her many times and takes a keen interest in the life of her son Bharata, often taking Bharata and Shatrugna away to Kaikeya kingdom for vacation.\n\nKaikeyi was a strong woman and was with her husband Dasharath in Dandaka forest while he was at war. While Kaikeyi saved the king in the war, as per mythology her left hand was strong as diamond  (a boon from a Saint) so the king accompanied her during wars.\n\nKaikeyi was the king's favourite queen. Kaikeyi's nature is described as being temperamental and unpredictable. While mostly she was sweet mannered, it is evident that she disliked the king spending time with his other queens. King Dasharatha mentions that he did not treat his queen Kausalya deservedly due to fear of Kaikeyi's tantrums.\n\nKaikeyi seemed almost naive when it came to understanding the rights of the four princes to Ayodhya's throne. She naively mentions to her maid Manthara that Bharata can rule Ayodhya after Rama, not really understanding the genealogical inheritance to the throne. It is Manthara who educates Kaikeyi of the rights to ascension to the throne.\n\nKaikeyi's naive nature and sweetness was transformed into obstinacy and power-hunger; all in the name of her son Bharata's welfare. Bharata contests her views vociferously and despises her for her act of banishing the rightful heir Rama to forests as if punishing him for no fault of his. King Dasharath tries to reason with her in terms of internal security of the kingdom, people's will, the Court's decision to crown Rama; none of which seems reasonable to her. Dasharath appeals to Kaikeyi to give the kingdom to Rama which was in her powers but she fails to do so. Finally, king Dasharatha renounces her, yet he is unable to separate himself from her. He lingers on in grief in her chambers for fear of humiliation from everyone outside those chambers.\n\n==Boons==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Four Sons of Dasaratha.jpg|thumb|250px|Birth Of Four Sons Of Dasharatha]]\n\n[[File: Kaikeyi told Dasharatha that he must fulfil her wish.jpg|thumb|Kaikeyi told Dasharatha that he must fulfil her wish.]]\nYears passed and all three Queens produced sons. [[Rama]], son of Kausalya, was Dasharatha's favourite son. During Rama's childhood, Kaikeyi loved to spend time with Rama and took care of him more than her own son. Rama was a loving, obedient child who followed in his father's footsteps. When he turned 16, he married [[Sita]], rumoured to be a daughter of the Earth Goddess and foster daughter of King [[Janaka]] of Mithila. Her son Bharata married Sita's cousin [[Mandavi]]. Her father Ashwapati fell ill and requested Bharata's presence. Kaikeyi's brother Yuddhajit notified Dasharatha of this and so he sent Bharata with Yuddhajit. Shatrughna, who was close to Bharata since childhood, went with him.\n\nLater, Dasharatha, with the approval of the royal assembly, selected Rama to be crowned King. Kaikeyi was delighted and as happy as she would have been had it been her own son, Bharata's, coronation. However, Manthara, Kaikeyi's nurse, became worried that Kaikeyi would lose her status as Chief Queen at Court if Rama ascended the throne, as Kausalya would thus become Queen Mother. She decided to instigate trouble. She tried to fuel Kaikeyi's jealousy and envy of Kausalya by reminding her that her son's coronation would give Kausalya her former status as the most important of Dasharatha's Queens and would cut Bharata out of the royal lineage forever, but this had no effect on Kaikeyi at the time.\n[[File: Rama hear demand of Kaikeyi.jpg |thumb|Rama hear Boons of Kaikeyi]]\nHowever, Manthara later convinced Kaikeyi to demand the two boons granted to her years earlier by Dasharatha. King Dasharatha was obliged to fulfil them. Kaikeyi demanded that Bharata be crowned king and Rama be sent to the forest for fourteen years. Hearing this, Dasharatha fell into a swoon and passed the night in a pitiable condition in Kaikeyi's palace.\n\n[[File: Kaikeyi told that according to the two boons granted by Dasaratha Rama should go to the forest for 14 years and Bharata must become the king.jpg|thumb|Kaikeyi said that according to the two boons granted by Dasharatha, Rama should go to the forest for 14 years and Bharata must become the king.]]After sending Rama into exile, a grief-stricken Dasharatha died of a broken heart six days after Rama left Ayodhya. Kaikeyi came to blame herself for this death. Furthermore, Bharata swore never to ascend the throne as it was his older brother's birthright. He further blamed her for his father's death and swore never to address her as Mother again. He also cursed her saying that no father shall hereafter name his daughter ''Kaikeyi''. It is reported that this is the reason why the name Kaikeyi is seldom heard of.

He told his father, the king of the Kekaya Kingdom about this. His father asked Kekaya Dynasty's royal priest about the childless life of his son. The royal priest told that the royal family should serve the Sages who were living in Rishi Varsha and which was surrounded by Aryavartha or Aryavarsha and Sthreevarsha. The King of Kekaya and Ashwapati went to Rishi Varsha to serve the Rishis. One of the sage was pleased with the service of the King and the prince of Kekaya. He prayed to Lord Surya to bless the prince with children. Lord Surya appeared and blessed Ashwapati with a son and a daughter. His wife became pregnant and twins were born to them at Arkakshetra. The rishi named the boy Yudhajit and the girl Kaikeyi. The king of Kekaya Kingdom spent a few years with his grandchildren and died due to illness. After the death of the King, Ashwapati became the King of Kekaya Kingdom, Yudhajit became the prince of Kekaya Kingdom and Kaikeyi became the princess of Kekaya Kingdom.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ramanan50.wordpress.com/2017/02/17/kaikeyi-born-in-russia-world-during-ramayana-part-3/|title=Kaikeyi Born In Russia World During Ramayana Part 3|first=|last=ramanan50|date=17 February 2017|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File: Dasharatha give Payasa to his wives.jpg|thumb|250px|Dasharatha gives Payasa to his wives]]\n\n==Relations==\nKaikeyi's nature and her relationships are quite revealing in Ayodhya Kand of Valmiki Ramayan.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.valmikiramayan.net/|website=Valmiki Ramayana|accessdate=12 June 2017|title=Valmiki Ramayana}}</ref> Kaikeyi maintained strong relations with her maternal family even after her wedding to King Dasharath. Her brother Yudhajit visits her many times and takes a keen interest in the life of her son Bharata, often taking Bharata and Shatrugna away to Kaikeya kingdom for vacation.\n\nKaikeyi was a strong woman and was with her husband Dasharath in Dandaka forest while he was at war. While Kaikeyi saved the king in the war, as per mythology her left hand was strong as diamond  (a boon from a Saint) so the king accompanied her during wars.\n\nKaikeyi was the king's favourite queen. Kaikeyi's nature is described as being temperamental and unpredictable. While mostly she was sweet mannered, it is evident that she disliked the king spending time with his other queens. King Dasharatha mentions that he did not treat his queen Kausalya deservedly due to fear of Kaikeyi's tantrums.\n\nKaikeyi seemed almost naive when it came to understanding the rights of the four princes to Ayodhya's throne. She naively mentions to her maid Manthara that Bharata can rule Ayodhya after Rama, not really understanding the genealogical inheritance to the throne. It is Manthara who educates Kaikeyi of the rights to ascension to the throne.\n\nKaikeyi's naive nature and sweetness was transformed into obstinacy and power-hunger; all in the name of her son Bharata's welfare. Bharata contests her views vociferously and despises her for her act of banishing the rightful heir Rama to forests as if punishing him for no fault of his. King Dasharath tries to reason with her in terms of internal security of the kingdom, people's will, the Court's decision to crown Rama; none of which seems reasonable to her. Dasharath appeals to Kaikeyi to give the kingdom to Rama which was in her powers but she fails to do so. Finally, king Dasharatha renounces her, yet he is unable to separate himself from her. He lingers on in grief in her chambers for fear of humiliation from everyone outside those chambers.\n\n==Boons==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2018}}\n[[File:Four Sons of Dasaratha.jpg|thumb|250px|Birth Of Four Sons Of Dasharatha]]\n\n[[File: Kaikeyi told Dasharatha that he must fulfil her wish.jpg|thumb|Kaikeyi told Dasharatha that he must fulfil her wish.]]\nYears passed and all three Queens produced sons. [[Rama]], son of Kausalya, was Dasharatha's favourite son. During Rama's childhood, Kaikeyi loved to spend time with Rama and took care of him more than her own son. Rama was a loving, obedient child who followed in his father's footsteps. When he turned 16, he married [[Sita]], rumoured to be a daughter of the Earth Goddess and foster daughter of King [[Janaka]] of Mithila. Her son Bharata married Sita's cousin [[Mandavi]]. Her father Ashwapati fell ill and requested Bharata's presence. Kaikeyi's brother Yuddhajit notified Dasharatha of this and so he sent Bharata with Yuddhajit. Shatrughna, who was close to Bharata since childhood, went with him.\n\nLater, Dasharatha, with the approval of the royal assembly, selected Rama to be crowned King. Kaikeyi was delighted and as happy as she would have been had it been her own son, Bharata's, coronation. However, Manthara, Kaikeyi's nurse, became worried that Kaikeyi would lose her status as Chief Queen at Court if Rama ascended the throne, as Kausalya would thus become Queen Mother. She decided to instigate trouble. She tried to fuel Kaikeyi's jealousy and envy of Kausalya by reminding her that her son's coronation would give Kausalya her former status as the most important of Dasharatha's Queens and would cut Bharata out of the royal lineage forever, but this had no effect on Kaikeyi at the time.\n[[File: Rama hear demand of Kaikeyi.jpg |thumb|Rama hear Boons of Kaikeyi]]\nHowever, Manthara later convinced Kaikeyi to demand the two boons granted to her years earlier by Dasharatha. King Dasharatha was obliged to fulfil them. Kaikeyi demanded that Bharata be crowned king and Rama be sent to the forest for fourteen years. Hearing this, Dasharatha fell into a swoon and passed the night in a pitiable condition in Kaikeyi's palace.\n\n[[File: Kaikeyi told that according to the two boons granted by Dasaratha Rama should go to the forest for 14 years and Bharata must become the king.jpg|thumb|Kaikeyi said that according to the two boons granted by Dasharatha, Rama should go to the forest for 14 years and Bharata must become the king.]]After sending Rama into exile, a grief-stricken Dasharatha died of a broken heart six days after Rama left Ayodhya. Kaikeyi came to blame herself for this death. Furthermore, Bharata swore never to ascend the throne as it was his older brother's birthright. He further blamed her for his father's death and swore never to address her as Mother again. He also cursed her saying that no father shall hereafter name his daughter ''Kaikeyi''. It is reported that this is the reason why the name Kaikeyi is seldom heard of. Realising her mistake, Kaikeyi repented sending her most beloved son away for 14 years.\n\nAfter Rama's return, she apologized to him for her sins. Rama touched her feet and said there was no need to ask for forgiveness as he didn't feel bad about what happened and he insisted  Bharata to forgive his mother. Rama also insisted to Bharata that what mothers do, whether it is good or bad (defending Kaikeyi), is for the betterment of their children, not for themselves, so it is not good to be angry and sour with them.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist|group=note}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Kaikeyi}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090302131132/http://ancientindians.wordpress.com/kaikeyi/ Kaikeyi story]\n* [http://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/ayodhya/sarga52/ayodhya_52_frame.htm]\n* [http://www.valmikiramayan.net/utf8/aranya/sarga16/aranya_16_frame.htm]\n\n{{Ramayana}}\n\n[[Category:Mythological queens]]\n[[Category:Raghuvamsa]]\n", "name_user": "R'n'B", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toIndonesian(link changed toIndonesian language) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaikeyi"}
