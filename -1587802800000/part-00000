The game is based on a series of [[Road racing|road races]] throughout the [[United States]] that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while using a combination of fisticuffs and blunt weaponry to hinder the other racers. It is the second installment in the ''[[Road Rash]]'' series, and introduces a split-screen two-player mode for competing human players, [[nitrous oxide]] charges on certain bikes, and [[chain]]s as offensive weapons.\n\nThe development of ''Road Rash II'' was initiated before the end of the 1991 Christmas season, and the game was released within its deadline of the following season. ''Road Rash II'' was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, with reviewers appreciating the visuals and addition of the multiplayer mode while pointing out the lack of innovation in the fundamental gameplay. A conversion for the [[Game Boy Color]] was developed by [[3d6 Games]] and released under the title ''Road Rash'' in 2000. The game saw additional releases on the [[PlayStation Portable]] compilation title ''[[EA Replay]]'' in 2006 and on the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] in 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Road_Rash_II_Split_Screen.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An example of two-player gameplay in the Genesis version of ''Road Rash II''. The game's larger cartridge size compared to its predecessor allowed the feature to be introduced in this installment of the series.]]\n''Road Rash II'' puts the player in control of a [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle racer]] who must finish in third-place or higher in a series of five road races to advance through the game's five [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].<ref name=\"GenManual3\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3</ref> The game's races take place in a number of locales across the [[United States]], including [[Hawaii]], [[Arizona]], [[Tennessee]], [[Alaska]], and [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"GenManual1718\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 17\u201318</ref> During a race, the player can brake, accelerate, and attack neighboring racers. The player character will punch at the nearest racer with a default input, while holding a directional button during the input will result in either a backhand or a kick. Some opponents wield weapons such as [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[chain]]s, which can be taken and used by the player if the enemy racer is attacked as they are holding the weapon out to strike.<ref name=\"GenManual2\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 2</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1014\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 10\u201314</ref> The player racer can be ejected from their bike if they crash into an obstacle (such as boulders, cars, [[deer]] and [[Cattle|cows]]<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>) or if they run out of [[Health (gaming)|stamina]] (shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen) due to fights with other racers. In this event, the racer will automatically run back toward their bike, though the player can alter their course and avoid incoming traffic with the directional buttons, or stand still by holding the brake input button. Opponents will likewise be ejected from their bike if their own stamina is depleted. The stamina of the nearest racer is visible within the bottom-right corner of the screen, and the color of both stamina meters change from green to red as they deplete.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\nThe player character begins the game with $1,000.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> When the player wins a race, a cash prize is added to the player's balance.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> From the main menu, the player can access a bike shop to view bikes for sale and potentially purchase a new bike with the money they have accumulated.<ref name=\"GenManual49\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1517\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 15\u201317</ref> Certain bikes are equipped with a series of [[nitrous oxide]] charges, which can provide a burst of speed if the player quickly taps the acceleration input button twice.<ref name=\"GenManual2\"/><ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> The player will receive a password at the end of a successful race, which can be entered at a password entry screen in a subsequent session to maintain the player's progress.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> When the player wins a race on all five of the game's tracks, they will advance to the next level. With each subsequent level, the cash prizes become higher, the courses become longer, and the opponent racers become more aggressive. The player wins the game if they win a race on each track in all five levels.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>\n\nThe player's bike has its own \"condition meter\" between the player's and opponents' stamina meters, which decreases every time the player suffers a crash. If the meter fully depletes, the bike will be wrecked, the player's participation in the current race will end, and a repair bill must be paid. Motorcycle cops also make sporadic appearances throughout the game's tracks. If the player crashes within the vicinity of a cop, the cop will end their participation in the current race by apprehending them and charging them a fine.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> With each subsequent level, repair bills and fines become more expensive, and cops appear more frequently.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> If the player lacks the funds to cover either a repair bill or a fine, the game will [[Game over|end prematurely]].<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\n''Road Rash II'' features a two-player mode that can either be [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|played intermittently between players]] or simultaneously with the use of a split-screen display. Two players can either race against each other along with other computer-controlled racers or engage in the \"Mano a Mano\" mode, in which the two human players are the only competing racers on the track. In this mode, the players can select a weapon to wield prior to the start of the race, and no money is won or lost, though cops still appear as an obstacle and can end the race if they apprehend one of the players.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> The Game Boy Color version also features a two-player mode via use of the [[Game Link Cable]].<ref name=\"EGMGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/21/EGM_US_135.pdf |title=Preview Gallery: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=October 2000 |page=122}}</ref><ref name=\"GameProGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |title=ProNews: Boy Scout \u2013 What's New in Handheld |magazine=[[GamePro]] |date=October 2000 |page=38 |access-date=2019-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512161054/https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |archive-date=2019-05-12 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Development and release==\nBefore the conclusion of the 1991 Christmas season, EA made the decision to create a sequel to ''Road Rash'', and set a deadline for the following Christmas. Although the development team considered the deadline tight given the length of the previous game's development, the established framework given by the preceding title allowed the team to focus on enhancing the gameplay and visuals for the sequel.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\">{{cite magazine |title=The Making of: The ''Road Rash'' Trilogy |last=Wallace |first=Mitch |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=166 |date=April 2017 |pages=20\u201327}}</ref> The total development team of ''Road Rash II'' consisted of three programmers, five graphic artists, and four track builders.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Behind the Screens: The Making of ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |pages=126\u2013127 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Returning crew members from the previous game include producer and designer Randy Breen, designer and programmer Dan Geisler, programmer Walt Stein, and artists Arthur Koch and Peggy Brennan.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, inner cover</ref> Carl Mey, the technical director of the original ''Road Rash'', was promoted to Director of Technology at EA following the first game's development, and thus had limited involvement with the sequel.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\">{{cite magazine |title=Behind the Scenes: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[GamesTM]] |issue=99 |date=August 2010 |publisher=Imagine Publishing |pages=138\u2013139}}</ref> Mey's game director position was inherited by Kevin McGrath,<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> and Mey would leave EA to work for [[Sega]] before the conclusion of ''Road Rash II'''s development.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\"/>\n\nBreen expanded the sequel's setting to explore the United States outside of the Californian locales of the previous game. Breen explained that \"I was trying to maintain a certain progression through the fantasy of the product, which was that the first ''Road Rash'' was a roots-oriented thing. It happened locally, and people would run these races surreptitiously and do them in back roads where nobody knew about them \u2013 kind of a ''[[Fight Club]]'' thing. And they gradually expanded outward.\" For the game's locations, some of the artists incorporated photos by reducing their colors, while others used the photos as reference and drew the locations from scratch. ''Road Rash II'' introduced the chain as an offensive weapon. To create reference material for the body mechanics of swinging a chain, Koch filmed himself performing the action.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> The expansion to an 8-megabit format from the original game's 5-megabits allowed the team to implement a split-screen two-player mode that they were unable to incorporate into the preceding title.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The two-player split screen took Geisler approximately three months to create. ''Road Rash II'' includes [[cutscene]]s that play at the end of a race, which were conceptualized as a reward based on the player's performance. The cutscenes were roughly [[storyboard]]ed and created by Koch in low resolution to fit within the console's memory. The characters in the cutscenes were ten pixels tall and informally referred to by the development team as \"little dudes\".<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/>\n\nThe artificial intelligence of the opponent racers was improved to be less predictable and more individualistic; certain racers would be more focused on the road than on the human racer, while others would be more aggressive.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The cops were also enhanced with the ability to take damage and fight back against the player, after previously being immune to player attacks and restricted to bumping against racers in the first game; Koch claimed that \"''Road Rash II'' was the first game in which you could beat, and get beaten, by a cop.\" Controversy surrounded this feature due to the recent [[Police brutality|beating]] of [[Rodney King]], which made the development team uncertain on its incorporation.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> Some potential new features that were omitted due to hardware limitations include weather conditions and a [[Harley-Davidson]]-style bike.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The game's audio was created by [[Rob Hubbard]], Don Veca and Tony Berkeley. The game's character banter and instruction booklet were written by Jamie Poolos.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> The yellow [[Yamaha FZR1000]] featured on the cover was Breen's own bike, and would later be featured in the full-motion videos of the 32-bit versions of ''Road Rash''.<ref name=\"RetroGamer88\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |title=Grazing Saddles: The Complete History of ''Road Rash'' |last=Hunt |first=Stuart |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=88 |date=April 2011 |page=47 |access-date=2019-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114210141/https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |archive-date=2020-01-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''Road Rash II'' was released in North America and Europe in December 1992.<ref name=\"GameFan\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/0/0c/GameFan_US_0102.pdf |title=Viewpoint: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[GameFan|Diehard GameFan]] |date=December 1992 |page=9}}</ref><ref name=\"MeanMachines\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/mean-machines-sega-magazine-02/page/n19 |title=MegaDrive Review: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mean Machines|Mean Machines Sega]] |last1=Leadbetter |first=Richard |last2=Automatic |first2=Radion |date=November 1992 |pages=20\u201323}}</ref><ref name=\"GamePro\">{{cite web |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |title=Genesis Pro Review: ''Road Rash II'' |author=Gideon |date=January 1993 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |pp=52\u201353 |access-date=2019-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171344/https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-12-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"EGMGEN\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |page=30 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Versions for the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] were announced in December 1994, but were not released.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/megazoneau46/page/n7/mode/2up |title=Game Spy: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mega Zone]] |date=December 1994 |page=9}}</ref> The Game Boy Color version was developed by [[3d6 Games]],<ref name=\"EGMGBC\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/62/EGM_US_137.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash'' (Game Boy Color) |last=Smith |first=Shawn |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=December 2000 |page=240}}</ref> with graphics created by [[Stoo Cambridge]].

The game is based on a series of [[Road racing|road races]] throughout the [[United States]] that the player must win to advance to higher-difficulty races, while using a combination of fisticuffs and blunt weaponry to hinder the other racers. It is the second installment in the ''[[Road Rash]]'' series, and introduces a split-screen two-player mode for competing human players, [[nitrous oxide]] charges on certain bikes, and [[chain]]s as offensive weapons.\n\nThe development of ''Road Rash II'' was initiated before the end of the 1991 Christmas season, and the game was released within its deadline of the following season. ''Road Rash II'' was met with critical acclaim and commercial success, with reviewers appreciating the visuals and addition of the multiplayer mode while pointing out the lack of innovation in the fundamental gameplay. A conversion for the [[Game Boy Color]] was developed by [[3d6 Games]] and released under the title ''Road Rash'' in 2000. The game saw additional releases on the [[PlayStation Portable]] compilation title ''[[EA Replay]]'' in 2006 and on the [[Sega Genesis Mini]] in 2019.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Road_Rash_II_Split_Screen.jpg|thumb|left|300px|An example of two-player gameplay in the Genesis version of ''Road Rash II''. The game's larger cartridge size compared to its predecessor allowed the feature to be introduced in this installment of the series.]]\n''Road Rash II'' puts the player in control of a [[Motorcycle racing|motorcycle racer]] who must finish in third-place or higher in a series of five road races to advance through the game's five [[Level (video gaming)|levels]].<ref name=\"GenManual3\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 3</ref> The game's races take place in a number of locales across the [[United States]], including [[Hawaii]], [[Arizona]], [[Tennessee]], [[Alaska]], and [[Vermont]].<ref name=\"GenManual1718\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 17\u201318</ref> During a race, the player can brake, accelerate, and attack neighboring racers. The player character will punch at the nearest racer with a default input, while holding a directional button during the input will result in either a backhand or a kick. Some opponents wield weapons such as [[Club (weapon)|clubs]] and [[chain]]s, which can be taken and used by the player if the enemy racer is attacked as they are holding the weapon out to strike.<ref name=\"GenManual2\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 2</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1014\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 10\u201314</ref> The player racer can be ejected from their bike if they crash into an obstacle (such as boulders, cars, [[deer]] and [[Cattle|cows]]<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>) or if they run out of [[Health (gaming)|stamina]] (shown in the bottom-left corner of the screen) due to fights with other racers. In this event, the racer will automatically run back toward their bike, though the player can alter their course and avoid incoming traffic with the directional buttons, or stand still by holding the brake input button. Opponents will likewise be ejected from their bike if their own stamina is depleted; the stamina of the nearest racer is visible within the bottom-right corner of the screen, and the color of both stamina meters change from green to red as they deplete.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\nThe player character begins the game with $1,000.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> When the player wins a race, a cash prize is added to the player's balance.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> From the main menu, the player can access a bike shop to view bikes for sale and potentially purchase a new bike with the money they have accumulated.<ref name=\"GenManual49\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20139</ref><ref name=\"GenManual1517\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 15\u201317</ref> Certain bikes are equipped with a series of [[nitrous oxide]] charges, which can provide a burst of speed if the player quickly taps the acceleration input button twice.<ref name=\"GenManual2\"/><ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> The player will receive a password at the end of a successful race, which can be entered at a password entry screen in a subsequent session to maintain the player's progress.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> When the player wins a race on all five of the game's tracks, they will advance to the next level. With each subsequent level, the cash prizes become higher, the courses become longer, and the opponent racers become more aggressive. The player wins the game if they win a race on each track in all five levels.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/>\n\nThe player's bike has its own \"condition meter\" between the player's and opponents' stamina meters, which decreases every time the player suffers a crash. If the meter fully depletes, the bike will be wrecked, the player's participation in the current race will end, and a repair bill must be paid. Motorcycle cops also make sporadic appearances throughout the game's tracks. If the player crashes within the vicinity of a cop, the cop will end their participation in the current race by apprehending them and charging them a fine.<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/> With each subsequent level, repair bills and fines become more expensive, and cops appear more frequently.<ref name=\"GenManual3\"/> If the player lacks the funds to cover either a repair bill or a fine, the game will [[Game over|end prematurely]].<ref name=\"GenManual1014\"/>\n\n''Road Rash II'' features a two-player mode that can either be [[Hotseat (multiplayer mode)|played intermittently between players]] or simultaneously with the use of a split-screen display. Two players can either race against each other along with other computer-controlled racers or engage in the \"Mano a Mano\" mode, in which the two human players are the only competing racers on the track. In this mode, the players can select a weapon to wield prior to the start of the race, and no money is won or lost, though cops still appear as an obstacle and can end the race if they apprehend one of the players.<ref name=\"GenManual49\"/> The Game Boy Color version also features a two-player mode via use of the [[Game Link Cable]].<ref name=\"EGMGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/21/EGM_US_135.pdf |title=Preview Gallery: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=October 2000 |page=122}}</ref><ref name=\"GameProGBCPreview\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |title=ProNews: Boy Scout \u2013 What's New in Handheld |magazine=[[GamePro]] |date=October 2000 |page=38 |access-date=2019-11-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190512161054/https://retrocdn.net/images/2/2e/GamePro_US_145.pdf |archive-date=2019-05-12 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n==Development and release==\nBefore the conclusion of the 1991 Christmas season, EA made the decision to create a sequel to ''Road Rash'', and set a deadline for the following Christmas. Although the development team considered the deadline tight given the length of the previous game's development, the established framework given by the preceding title allowed the team to focus on enhancing the gameplay and visuals for the sequel.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\">{{cite magazine |title=The Making of: The ''Road Rash'' Trilogy |last=Wallace |first=Mitch |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=166 |date=April 2017 |pages=20\u201327}}</ref> The total development team of ''Road Rash II'' consisted of three programmers, five graphic artists, and four track builders.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Behind the Screens: The Making of ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |pages=126\u2013127 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Returning crew members from the previous game include producer and designer Randy Breen, designer and programmer Dan Geisler, programmer Walt Stein, and artists Arthur Koch and Peggy Brennan.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\">''Road Rash II'' (Genesis) instruction manual, inner cover</ref> Carl Mey, the technical director of the original ''Road Rash'', was promoted to Director of Technology at EA following the first game's development, and thus had limited involvement with the sequel.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\">{{cite magazine |title=Behind the Scenes: ''Road Rash'' |magazine=[[GamesTM]] |issue=99 |date=August 2010 |publisher=Imagine Publishing |pages=138\u2013139}}</ref> Mey's game director position was inherited by Kevin McGrath,<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> and Mey would leave EA to work for [[Sega]] before the conclusion of ''Road Rash II'''s development.<ref name=\"GamesTM99\"/>\n\nBreen expanded the sequel's setting to explore the United States outside of the Californian locales of the previous game. Breen explained that \"I was trying to maintain a certain progression through the fantasy of the product, which was that the first ''Road Rash'' was a roots-oriented thing. It happened locally, and people would run these races surreptitiously and do them in back roads where nobody knew about them \u2013 kind of a ''[[Fight Club]]'' thing. And they gradually expanded outward.\" For the game's locations, some of the artists incorporated photos by reducing their colors, while others used the photos as reference and drew the locations from scratch. ''Road Rash II'' introduced the chain as an offensive weapon. To create reference material for the body mechanics of swinging a chain, Koch filmed himself performing the action.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> The expansion to an 8-megabit format from the original game's 5-megabits allowed the team to implement a split-screen two-player mode that they were unable to incorporate into the preceding title.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The two-player split screen took Geisler approximately three months to create. ''Road Rash II'' includes [[cutscene]]s that play at the end of a race, which were conceptualized as a reward based on the player's performance. The cutscenes were roughly [[storyboard]]ed and created by Koch in low resolution to fit within the console's memory. The characters in the cutscenes were ten pixels tall and informally referred to by the development team as \"little dudes\".<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/>\n\nThe artificial intelligence of the opponent racers was improved to be less predictable and more individualistic; certain racers would be more focused on the road than on the human racer, while others would be more aggressive.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The cops were also enhanced with the ability to take damage and fight back against the player, after previously being immune to player attacks and restricted to bumping against racers in the first game; Koch claimed that \"''Road Rash II'' was the first game in which you could beat, and get beaten, by a cop.\" Controversy surrounded this feature due to the recent [[Police brutality|beating]] of [[Rodney King]], which made the development team uncertain on its incorporation.<ref name=\"RetroGamer166\"/> Some potential new features that were omitted due to hardware limitations include weather conditions and a [[Harley-Davidson]]-style bike.<ref name=\"EGMBtS\"/> The game's audio was created by [[Rob Hubbard]], Don Veca and Tony Berkeley. The game's character banter and instruction booklet were written by Jamie Poolos.<ref name=\"GenManualInner\"/> The yellow [[Yamaha FZR1000]] featured on the cover was Breen's own bike, and would later be featured in the full-motion videos of the 32-bit versions of ''Road Rash''.<ref name=\"RetroGamer88\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |title=Grazing Saddles: The Complete History of ''Road Rash'' |last=Hunt |first=Stuart |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |issue=88 |date=April 2011 |page=47 |access-date=2019-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114210141/https://archive.org/stream/RetroGamerIssue086-090/Retro_Gamer_Issue_088#page/n45/mode/2up |archive-date=2020-01-14 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n''Road Rash II'' was released in North America and Europe in December 1992.<ref name=\"GameFan\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/0/0c/GameFan_US_0102.pdf |title=Viewpoint: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[GameFan|Diehard GameFan]] |date=December 1992 |page=9}}</ref><ref name=\"MeanMachines\">{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/mean-machines-sega-magazine-02/page/n19 |title=MegaDrive Review: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mean Machines|Mean Machines Sega]] |last1=Leadbetter |first=Richard |last2=Automatic |first2=Radion |date=November 1992 |pages=20\u201323}}</ref><ref name=\"GamePro\">{{cite web |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |title=Genesis Pro Review: ''Road Rash II'' |author=Gideon |date=January 1993 |magazine=[[GamePro]] |pp=52\u201353 |access-date=2019-09-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181229171344/https://retrocdn.net/images/5/54/GamePro_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-12-29 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"EGMGEN\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=January 1993 |page=30 |access-date=2019-11-17 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721024859/https://retrocdn.net/images/9/93/EGM_US_042.pdf |archive-date=2018-07-21 |url-status=live }}</ref> Versions for the [[Master System]] and [[Game Gear]] were announced in December 1994, but were not released.<ref>{{cite magazine |url=https://archive.org/details/megazoneau46/page/n7/mode/2up |title=Game Spy: ''Road Rash 2'' |magazine=[[Mega Zone]] |date=December 1994 |page=9}}</ref> The Game Boy Color version was developed by [[3d6 Games]],<ref name=\"EGMGBC\">{{cite magazine |url=https://retrocdn.net/images/6/62/EGM_US_137.pdf |title=Review Crew: ''Road Rash'' (Game Boy Color) |last=Smith |first=Shawn |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |date=December 2000 |page=240}}</ref> with graphics created by [[Stoo Cambridge]].

Occurrences during [[prenatal development]] may be important; researchers studied fetuses in utero and determined that handedness in the womb was a very accurate predictor of handedness after birth.<ref>{{cite journal|url=|title=Prenatal thumb sucking is related to postnatal handedness| doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2004.08.009|pmid=15707608|volume=43|issue=3|journal=Neuropsychologia|pages=313\u2013315|year=2005 | last1 = Hepper | first1 = Peter G.}}</ref> In a 2013 study, 39% of infants (6 to 14 months) and 97% of toddlers (18 to 24 months) demonstrated a hand preference.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson EL, Campbell JM, Michel GF | year = 2013 | title = Unimanual to bimanual: Tracking the development of handedness from 6 to 24 months | journal = Infant Behavior and Development | volume = 36 | issue = 2 | pages = 181\u2013188 | pmc=3615031 | doi=10.1016/j.infbeh.2013.01.009 | pmid=23454419}}</ref>\n\n=== Division of labor ===\nOne common theory as to how handedness affects the hemispheres is the brain hemisphere division of labor. Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function|url=https://archive.org/details/neuropsychologyn00bani |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nVerbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].<ref name=book/>\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nHandedness displays a complex inheritance pattern. For example, if both parents of a child are left-handed, there is a 26% chance of that child being left-handed.<ref name=\"McManusChris\">{{cite book | author=McManus, Chris | title=Right Hand, Left Hand | publisher=Phoenix Paperbacks | year=2003 | isbn=978-0753813553}}</ref> A large study of twins from 25,732 families by Medland et al.

About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left [[occiput]] (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,<ref>Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.</ref> and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994\u20131007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Ultrasound ===\nAnother theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy.

He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.<ref>[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504153055/http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ |date=2012-05-04 }} Accessed June 2006.</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,\n<blockquote>Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.<ref>Chris McManus. April 14, 2012.

Goodman also found that left-handers were overrepresented at the low end of the cognitive spectrum, with the mentally disabled being twice as likely to be left-handed compared to the general population, as well as generally lower cognitive and non-cognitive abilities amongst left-handed children.<ref name=\"Goodman 193\u2013212\">{{cite journal|title=The Wages of Sinistrality: Handedness, Brain Structure, and Human Capital Accumulation|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|date=Fall 2014 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=193\u2013212 |doi=10.1257/jep.28.4.193 |last=Goodman|first=Joshua|url = http://nrs.harvard.edu/urn-3:HUL.InstRepos:7779971}}</ref> Moreover, Ntolka and Papadatou-Pastou in a systematic review and meta-analysis found that it is right-handers who have higher IQ scores, but this difference is negligible (about 1.5 points).<ref name=\"Ntolka & Papadatou-Pastou\">{{cite journal|url=|title=Right-handers have negligibly higher IQ scores than left-handers: Systematic review and meta-analyses|journal=Neuroscience and Biobehavioral Reviews|date=2018 |volume=84|pages=376\u2013393 |doi=10.1016/j.neubiorev.2017.08.007 |pmid=28826694|last1=Ntolka|first1=Eleni|last2=Papadatou-Pastou|first2=Marietta}}</ref>\n\n==== Early childhood intelligence ====\nNelson, Campbell, and Michel studied infants and whether developing handedness during infancy correlated with language abilities in toddlers. In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18\u201324 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores.<ref>Nelson, E.L., J.M. Campbell, and G.F.

[[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \"blind side,\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. While uncommon, there have been several [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|notable left-handed quarterbacks]].\n* In [[bowling]], the oil pattern used on the bowling lane [[bowling ball#Effect of lane characteristics on ball motion|breaks down]] faster the more times a ball is rolled down the lane. Bowlers must continually adjust their shots to compensate for the ball's change in rotation as the game or series is played and the oil is altered from its original pattern. A left-handed bowler competes on the opposite side of the lane from the right-handed bowler and therefore deals with less breakdown of the original oil placement. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes.\n\n=== Gender ===\nAccording to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.<ref name=\"Papadatou\">{{cite journal|last=Papadatou-Pastou|first=M|author2=Martin, M|author3=Munaf\u00f2, MR|author4=Jones, GV|date=September 2008|title=Sex differences in left-handedness: a meta-analysis of 144 studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=134|issue=5|pages=677\u201399|doi=10.1037/a0012814|pmid=18729568}}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Sexuality and gender identity ===\n{{further|Handedness and sexual orientation}}\nA number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumi\u00e8re ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575\u2013592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}</ref> though findings are mixed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1023/A:1014039403752 \n| pmid = 11910784 \n| year = 2002 \n| last1 = Mustanski | first1 = B.

In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.\n\nThe Latin adjective ''sinister'' or ''sinistra'' (as applied to male or female nouns\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u2060Latin nouns are gender specific) means \"left\" as well as \"unlucky\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \"sinister\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \"ambisinister\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'.\n\nThere are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \"left-handed\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \"left-handed compliment\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both \"left\" and \"awkward\" or \"clumsy\", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to \"adroit\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\". The name \"Dexter\" derives from the Latin for \"right\", as does the word \"dexterity\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.\n\n[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the \"[[left-hand path]]\".\n\nUntil very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.<ref>[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle f\u00fcr Linksh\u00e4nder und umge-schulte Linksh\u00e4nder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922143207/http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm |date=2013-09-22 }}.

Since speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, its presumption is that it would be more efficient to have one brain hemisphere do both, rather than having it divided up. Since in most people the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness predominates. This theory also predicts that left-handed people have a reversed brain division of labor.<ref name=book>{{cite book |last=Banich |first=Marie |authorlink=Marie Banich |year=1997 |title=Neuropsychology: The Neural Bases of Mental Function|url=https://archive.org/details/neuropsychologyn00bani |url-access=registration }}</ref>\n\nVerbal processing in right-handed individuals takes place mostly in the left hemisphere, whereas visuospatial processing is mostly done in the opposite hemisphere. Left-handed individuals have a heterogeneous brain organization in which their brain hemispheres are either organized in the same way as right-handers (but with the hemispheres reversed) or even such that both hemispheres are used for verbal processing. When the average is taken across all types of left-handedness, it shows that left-handers are less [[Lateralization of brain function|lateralized]].<ref name=book/>\n\n=== Genetic factors ===\nHandedness displays a complex inheritance pattern.

About two-thirds of fetuses present with their left [[occiput]] (back of the head) at birth. This partly explains why prematurity results in a decrease in right-handedness. Previc argues that asymmetric prenatal positioning creates asymmetric stimulation of the vestibular system, which is involved in the development of handedness. In fact, every major disorder in which patients show reduced right-handedness is associated with either [[vestibular system|vestibular]] abnormalities or delay,<ref>Nonright-handedness, central nervous system and related pathology, and its lateralization: A reformulation and synthesis.</ref> and asymmetry of the [[vestibular cortex]] is strongly correlated with the direction of handedness.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Dieterich | first1 = M. | last2 = Bense | first2 = S. | last3 = Lutz | first3 = S. | last4 = Drzezga | first4 = A. | last5 = Stephan | first5 = T. | last6 = Bartenstein | first6 = P. | last7 = Brandt | first7 = T. | year = 2003 | title = Dominance for vestibular cortical function in the non-dominant hemisphere | url = | journal = Cerebral Cortex | volume = 13 | issue = 9| pages = 994\u20131007 | pmid = 12902399 | doi = 10.1093/cercor/13.9.994 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\n=== Ultrasound ===\nAnother theory is that [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] may sometimes affect the brains of unborn children, causing higher rates of left-handedness in children whose mothers received ultrasounds during pregnancy.

He says that left-handers' brains are structured differently (in a way that increases their range of abilities) and the genes that determine left-handedness also govern development of the language centers of the brain.<ref>[http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ Right-Hand, Left-Hand official website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120504153055/http://www.righthandlefthand.com/ |date=2012-05-04 }} Accessed June 2006.</ref>\n\nWriting in ''[[Scientific American]],'' McManus states that,\n<blockquote>Studies in the U.K., U.S. and Australia have revealed that left-handed people differ from right-handers by only one IQ point, which is not noteworthy ... Left-handers' brains are structured differently from right-handers' in ways that can allow them to process language, spatial relations and emotions in more diverse and potentially creative ways. Also, a slightly larger number of left-handers than right-handers are especially gifted in music and math. A study of musicians in professional orchestras found a significantly greater proportion of talented left-handers, even among those who played instruments that seem designed for right-handers, such as violins. Similarly, studies of adolescents who took tests to assess mathematical giftedness found many more left-handers in the population.<ref>Chris McManus. April 14, 2012.

In the article they assessed 38 infants and followed them through to 12 months and then again once they became toddlers from 18\u201324 months. What they discovered was that when a child developed a consistent use of their right or left hand during infancy (such as using the right hand to put the pacifier back in, or grasping random objects with the left hand), they were more likely to have superior language skills as a toddler. Children who became lateral later than infancy (i.e., when they were toddlers) showed normal development of language and had typical language scores.<ref>Nelson, E.L., J.M. Campbell, and G.F.

[[Tight end]]s, when only one is used, typically line up on the same side as the throwing hand of the quarterback, while the [[offensive tackle]] on the opposite hand, which protects the quarterback's \"blind side,\" is typically the most valued member of the offensive line. While uncommon, there have been several [[List of left-handed quarterbacks|notable left-handed quarterbacks]].\n* In [[bowling]], the oil pattern used on the bowling lane [[bowling ball#Effect of lane characteristics on ball motion|breaks down]] faster the more times a ball is rolled down the lane. Bowlers must continually adjust their shots to compensate for the ball's change in rotation as the game or series is played and the oil is altered from its original pattern. A left-handed bowler competes on the opposite side of the lane from the right-handed bowler and therefore deals with less breakdown of the original oil placement. This means left-handed bowlers have to adjust their shot less frequently than right-handed bowlers in team events or qualifying rounds where there are possibly 4-10 people per set of two lanes. This can allow them to stay more consistent. However, this advantage is not present in bracket rounds and tournament finals where matches are 1v1 on a pair of lanes.\n\n=== Gender ===\nAccording to a meta-analysis of 144 studies, totaling 1,787,629 participants, the best estimate for the male to female odds ratio was 1.23, indicating 23% more men are left-handed. 11% of men and 9% of women would be approximately 10% overall, at a 1.22 male to female odds ratio.<ref name=\"Papadatou\">{{cite journal|last=Papadatou-Pastou|first=M|author2=Martin, M|author3=Munaf\u00f2, MR|author4=Jones, GV|date=September 2008|title=Sex differences in left-handedness: a meta-analysis of 144 studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=134|issue=5|pages=677\u201399|doi=10.1037/a0012814|pmid=18729568}}</ref>{{clarify|date=January 2018}}\n\n=== Sexuality and gender identity ===\n{{further|Handedness and sexual orientation}}\nA number of studies examining the relationship between handedness and sexual orientation have reported that a disproportionate minority of homosexual people exhibit left-handedness,<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Lalumi\u00e8re ML, Blanchard R, Zucker KJ | year = 2000 | title = Sexual orientation and handedness in men and women: a meta-analysis | journal = Psychological Bulletin | volume = 126 | issue = 4 | pages = 575\u2013592 | doi=10.1037/0033-2909.126.4.575 | pmid=10900997}}</ref> though findings are mixed.<ref>{{Cite journal \n| doi = 10.1023/A:1014039403752 \n| pmid = 11910784 \n| year = 2002 \n| last1 = Mustanski | first1 = B.

In many European languages, including English, the word for the direction \"right\" also means \"correct\" or \"proper\". Throughout history, being left-handed was considered negative, or evil; even into the 20th century, left-handed children were beaten by schoolteachers for writing with their left hand.\n\nThe Latin adjective ''sinister'' or ''sinistra'' (as applied to male or female nouns\u200a\u2060\u2014\u200a\u2060Latin nouns are gender specific) means \"left\" as well as \"unlucky\", and this double meaning survives in European derivatives of Latin, including the English words \"sinister\" (meaning both 'evil' and 'on the bearer's left on a coat of arms') and \"ambisinister\" meaning 'awkward or clumsy with both or either hand'.\n\nThere are many negative connotations associated with the phrase \"left-handed\": clumsy, awkward, unlucky, insincere, sinister, malicious, and so on. A \"left-handed compliment\" is one that has two meanings, one of which is unflattering to the recipient. In [[French language|French]], ''gauche'' means both \"left\" and \"awkward\" or \"clumsy\", while ''droit(e)'' ([[cognate]] to English ''direct'' and related to \"adroit\") means both \"right\" and \"straight\", as well as \"law\" and the legal sense of \"right\". The name \"Dexter\" derives from the Latin for \"right\", as does the word \"dexterity\" meaning manual skill. As these are all very old words, they would tend to support theories indicating that the predominance of right-handedness is an extremely old phenomenon.\n\n[[Black magic]] is sometimes referred to as the \"[[left-hand path]]\".\n\nUntil very recently in [[Taiwan]] (and still in [[Mainland China]], [[Japan]] and [[Korea|both North and South Korea]]), left-handed people were forced to switch to being right-handed, or at least switch to writing with the right hand. Due to the importance of [[stroke order]], developed for the comfortable use of right-handed people, it is considered more difficult to write legible Chinese characters with the left hand than it is to write Latin letters, though difficulty is subjective and depends on the writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm|title=A question of the left being right \u2013 and normal|work=China Daily|date=February 22, 2008|accessdate=2011-01-19| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110124025533/http://china.org.cn/english/LivinginChina/243637.htm| archivedate= January 24, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref> Because writing when moving one's hand away from its side towards the other side of the body can cause smudging if the outward side of the hand is allowed to drag across the writing, writing in the [[Latin alphabet]] might possibly be less feasible with the left hand than the right under certain circumstances. Conversely, right-to-left alphabets, such as the Arabic and Hebrew, are generally considered easier to write with the left hand in general.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} Depending on the position and inclination of the writing paper, and the writing method, the left-handed writer can write as neatly and efficiently or as messily and slowly as right-handed writers. Usually the left-handed child needs to be taught how to write correctly with the left hand, since discovering a comfortable left-handed writing method on one's own may not be straightforward.<ref>[http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm Erste deutsche Beratungs- und Informationsstelle f\u00fcr Linksh\u00e4nder und umge-schulte Linksh\u00e4nder] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130922143207/http://www.lefthander-consulting.org/deutsch/InfoSchreiben.htm |date=2013-09-22 }}.

Thousands of left-handed people in today's society have to adapt to use right-handed tools and objects. Again according to the club, \"in the U.K. alone there were over 20 regional events to mark the day in 2001 \u2013 including left-v-right sports matches, a left-handed tea party, pubs using left-handed corkscrews where patrons drank and played pub games with the left hand only, and nationwide 'Lefty Zones' where left-handers' creativity, adaptability and sporting prowess were celebrated, whilst right-handers were encouraged to try out everyday left-handed objects to see just how awkward it can feel using the wrong equipment!\"<ref name=\"about\" />\n\n== In other animals ==\n[[Kangaroo]]s and other [[Macropodidae|macropod]] [[marsupial]]s show a left-hand preference for everyday tasks in the wild. 'True' handedness is unexpected in marsupials however, because unlike [[Placentalia|placental mammals]], they lack a [[corpus callosum]]. Left-handedness was particularly apparent in the red kangaroo (''Macropus rufus'') and the eastern gray kangaroo (''Macropus giganteus''). Red-necked (Bennett's) wallabies (''Macropus rufogriseus'') preferentially use their left hand for behaviours that involve fine manipulation, but the right for behaviours that require more physical strength.

Rourkela Steel Plant was the first steel plant in Asia to use the LD ([[Linz-Donawitz process|Linz-Donawitz]]) process of steel-making. Rourkela Steel Plant has an associated fertilizer plant that produces nitrogeneous fertilizers using ammonia feedstock (from its coke oven plant). On 3 February 1959, then president Rajendra Prasad inaugurated RSP's first blast furnace named 'Parvati' when the company was known as Hindustan Steel Limited (HSL). Subsequently, the RSP became a unit of the (SAIL).\n\n==History==\nThe agreement wag signed on the 15th August this year at Bonn in Germany by the Secretary, Ministry of Production, on behalf of the Government of India, and two German firms of international repute, namely, Krupps and Demag. The agreement provides for the technical and financial participation of these two firms in the construction of a new steel plant with the initial capacity of half a million tons of ingots, capable later of expansion to a capacity of one million tons.\n\nThe capital cost of the project is estimated to be about Rs. 71-25 crores. The share capital to .be contributed by the German collaborators is expected to be of the order of Rs. 9 5 crores,the exact amount depending on the value of the plant that they may\nsupply, and the balance of share capital will be found by the Government of India. It is proposed, however, to apply to the International Bank for Development and Reconstruction for a loan of about Rs, 20 crores towards the capital cost.\n\nThe German investment wlU be for a period of about 10 years, with option to either side to continue the association for a further period of 10 years. Global tenders for supplies will be Invited and quality, prices and deliveries of plant will be the determining factors in selecting 4lhe suppliers.\n\nThe German Combine will be appointed the technical consultarlts and will receive a fixed iee of about Rs. 2.10 crores, which works out to about 3 per cent, on the estimated cost No royalties are payable and no bonus shares will be issued The management of the company will be vested in a board, in which the Government and the Combine will have representation proportionate to their respective investments. The\nChairman and the Managing Director will be the nominees of Government, thereby reserving to Government the control and overall management of this vital industry. The German Combine will recommend a team of technical experts for the efficient working of the plant. The number of Germans to be employed will be kept down to the minimum commensurate with the requirements of efficiency. Indians will receive, meanwhile specialised training for the progresr give replacement of German nationals.\n\nThe German collaborators expect that the plant could be* commissioned within a period of four years after the preliminary details have been settled, A representative team is expected in India in September to dis^ cuss and settle the constitution of a Company and to make specific recommendations on the location of the plant etc. The over-riding consideration for location will *be the economics \nof production and of distribution and the site will be selected with these In view After a careful assessment of the\nrequirements for steel with the growing indu^ialisation of the country, Government have come to the con- <^]u8ion that there still exists the need for the establishment of another unit after providing for the expansion of the present project. To this end, necessary planning and other action will be initiated.<ref>https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/55668/1/lsd_01_04_24-08-1953.pdf page 34</ref>\n\nThe  German  Firms of Krupp Sc Demag with whom we had arrived  at  an  agreement,  would  be asked  to  tender  their  advice  on  the location  of  the  plant,  its  design,  erec\u00adtion  and  operation.  Accordingly,  the technical  experts  of  the  German  firms visited  the  States   of  Bihar,  West Bengal,  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Orissa and  studied  earlier  technical  reports and  the  Memoranda  submitted  by these  Governments.  They  collected additional  data,  inspected  the proposed sites,  and  held  discussions  with  the Governments  as  well  as  with the  Cen\u00adtral  authorities  concerned.  After  a study  and  assessment  of  the  material so  collected,  both  here  and  in  associa\u00adtion  with  their  top  technical  experts in  Germany,  they  have  recommended the  location  of  the  new  Steel  Plant  at Rourkela  in  Orissa.<ref>https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/55610/1/lsd_01_06_16-02-1954.pdf Page 39</ref>\n\nThe  Government  of  India  have  very carefully  examined  this  recommenda\u00adtion.  They  have  considered  the  views of  the  Governments  of  Madhya  Pra\u00addesh,  West  Bengal  and  Orissa,  on  the report  of  the  Consultants.  They  have also had the benefit of discussions with the  Chief  Ministers  of  Madhya  Pra\u00addesh  and  West Bengal  and  two Minis^ ters  of  Orissa.  Having  taken  into consideration  all  the  factors  and  the data  available,  the  Government  of India have come to the conclusion that the  recommendation  of  their  Consul\u00adtants  in  regard  to  the  location  of  this Plant  at  Rourkela  should  be  accepted.The  Government  of  India  have  also decided  that  a  further  intensive  sur\u00advey,  examination  and  analysis  of  the mineral  resources  of  Madhya  Pradesh should  be  immediately  taken  in  hand, with  particular  reference  to  iron  ore and  coal,  to  facilitate  the  economic and  industrial  development  of  these resources <ref>https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/55610/1/lsd_01_06_16-02-1954.pdf Page 39</ref>\n\nRecently, a Rs 12,000-crore modernisation and expansion project at the Rourkela Steel Plant was dedicated to the Nation by Prime minister [[Narendra Modi]] on 1 April 2015.<ref>http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2015-04-01/news/60720294_1_pm-modi-rourkela-steel-plant-steel-authority</ref> RSP presently has the capacity to produce 4.5 million tonnes of hot metal, 4.2 million tonnes of crude steel and 3.9 million tonnes of saleable steel.<ref>http://www.sail.co.in/rourkela-steel-plant/about-rourkela-steel-plant</ref> <br /> The capacity of Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) is expected to rise to 10.8 MTPA by 2025.<ref>http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/odisha/Odisha-in-Centres-Steel-Blueprint/2015/02/02/article2648696.ece</ref>\nAshwini Kumar took over as Chief Executive Officer of Rourkela Steel Plant (RSP) in 2016.\n\n== Upgrade and modernization ==\nThe RSP has many firsts to its credit. It is the first plant in [[Asia]] to adopt the energy-efficient LD process of steel making and the first integrated steel plant of SAIL which adopted the cost-effective and quality-centered continuous casting route to process 100% of steel produced. The plant has also, for the first time in India, had adopted external desulphurisation of hot metal by calcium carbide injection process. RSP is one of the unique units under the SAIL umbrella with a wide variety of special purpose steels.\n\nAfter RSP was set up with the help of German collaboration. Subsequently, its steel making capacity was enhanced to 2 million tonnes and added many units to the facility.\n\nA pipe plant and special plate plant were set up during the 1970s for production of [[Electric resistance welding|ERW]] pipes and steel plates for defense requirements.

It is proposed, however, to apply to the International Bank for Development and Reconstruction for a loan of about Rs, 20 crores towards the capital cost.\n\nThe German investment wlU be for a period of about 10 years, with option to either side to continue the association for a further period of 10 years. Global tenders for supplies will be Invited and quality, prices and deliveries of plant will be the determining factors in selecting 4lhe suppliers.\n\nThe German Combine will be appointed the technical consultarlts and will receive a fixed iee of about Rs. 2.10 crores, which works out to about 3 per cent, on the estimated cost No royalties are payable and no bonus shares will be issued The management of the company will be vested in a board, in which the Government and the Combine will have representation proportionate to their respective investments. The\nChairman and the Managing Director will be the nominees of Government, thereby reserving to Government the control and overall management of this vital industry. The German Combine will recommend a team of technical experts for the efficient working of the plant. The number of Germans to be employed will be kept down to the minimum commensurate with the requirements of efficiency. Indians will receive, meanwhile specialised training for the progresr give replacement of German nationals.\n\nThe German collaborators expect that the plant could be* commissioned within a period of four years after the preliminary details have been settled, A representative team is expected in India in September to dis^ cuss and settle the constitution of a Company and to make specific recommendations on the location of the plant etc. The over-riding consideration for location will *be the economics \nof production and of distribution and the site will be selected with these In view After a careful assessment of the\nrequirements for steel with the growing indu^ialisation of the country, Government have come to the con- <^]u8ion that there still exists the need for the establishment of another unit after providing for the expansion of the present project. To this end, necessary planning and other action will be initiated. <ref> https://eparlib.nic.in/bitstream/123456789/55668/1/lsd_01_04_24-08-1953.pdf page 34 </ref>\n\nThe  German  Firms of Krupp Sc Demag with whom we had arrived  at  an  agreement,  would  be asked  to  tender  their  advice  on  the location  of  the  plant,  its  design,  erec\u00adtion  and  operation.  Accordingly,  the technical  experts  of  the  German  firms visited  the  States   of  Bihar,  West Bengal,  Madhya  Pradesh  and  Orissa and  studied  earlier  technical  reports and  the  Memoranda  submitted  by these  Governments.  They  collected additional  data,  inspected  the proposed sites,  and  held  discussions  with  the Governments  as  well  as  with the  Cen\u00adtral  authorities  concerned.

Readers cannot be [[Gullibility|gullible]] but also should not be [[Paranoia|paranoid]] that all [[information]] is incorrect. There is always a chance that even readers who have this balance will believe an error to be true or that they will disregard factual information as incorrect.

When readers believe something to be true before researching it, they are more likely to believe information that supports these prior beliefs or opinions. This phenomenon may lead readers who otherwise are skilled at evaluating credible sources and facts to believe misinformation.\n\nAccording to research, the factors that lead to recognizing misinformation is the amount of education a person has and the information literacy they have.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Khan|first=M.

Afterwards, the U.S. attorney general at the time, Alberto Gonzales, repeated the claim. However, the number that Hansen used in his reporting had no backing. Hansen said he received the information from ''Dateline'' expert Ken Lanning, but Lanning admitted that he made up the number 50,000 because there was no solid data on the number. According to Lanning, he used 50,000 because it sounds like a real number, not too big and not too small, and referred to it as a \"[[Goldilocks and the Three Bears|Goldilocks]] number\". Reporter Carl Bialik says that the number 50,000 is used often in the media to estimate numbers when reporters are unsure of the exact data.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Influencing Machine|last=Gladstone|first=Brooke|publisher=W.
