The shallow stations comprise 79 [[Shallow column station|spanned column]] stations (a large portion of them following the \"centipede\" design), 33 [[Shallow single-vault station|single-vaulted stations]] (Kharkov technology), and three single-spanned stations. In addition, there are 12 ground-level stations, four elevated stations, and one station ([[Vorobyovy Gory (Moscow Metro)|Vorobyovy Gory]]) on a bridge. Two stations have three tracks, and one has double halls. Seven of the stations have side platforms (only one of which is subterranean). In addition, there were two temporary stations within rail yards. One station is reserved for future service ([[Delovoy Tsentr (Kalininsko\u2013Solntsevskaya line)|Delovoy Tsentr]] for the [[Kalininsko-Solntsevskaya line]]).\n\nThe stations being constructed under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin's]] [[Stalinism|regime]], in the style of [[socialist classicism]], were meant as underground \"palaces of the people\". Stations such as [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya line)|Komsomolskaya]], [[Kiyevskaya (Koltsevaya line)|Kiyevskaya]] or [[Mayakovskaya]] and others built after 1935 in the second phase of the evolution of the network are tourist landmarks, their photogenic architecture, large chandeliers and detailed decoration unusual for an urban transport system.\n\n{{wide image|\u041f\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0440\u0430\u043c\u0430 \u0441\u0442\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0438\u0438 \u043c\u0435\u0442\u0440\u043e \u041a\u0421\u041b \u041c\u0438\u0447\u0443\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u043f\u0435\u043a\u0442.jpg|700px|align-cap=center|[[Michurinsky Prospekt]] is the first semi-underground station in the Moscow Metro}}<gallery mode=\"packed\" heights=\"110\">\nFile:Metro MSK Line3 Arbatskaya (img1).jpg|[[Arbatskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line)|Arbatskaya]]\nFile:MoscowMetro KievskayaKoltsevaya HG4b.jpg|[[Kiyevskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Kiyevskaya]]\nFile:MosMetro KomsomolskayaKL img2 asv2018-01.jpg|[[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Komsomolskaya]]\nFile:Mayakovskaya after renewing 2010.jpg|[[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]]\nFile:Kievsk APL 28.jpg|[[Kiyevskaya (Arbatsko\u2013Pokrovskaya line)|Kiyevskaya]]\nFile:Metro MSK Line5 Novoslobodskaya.jpg|[[Novoslobodskaya]]\nFile:Ploshchad revolyutsii Metro 2010.jpg|[[Ploshchad Revolyutsii (Moscow Metro)|Ploshchad Revolyutsii]]\nFile:Moscow Elektrozavodskaya metro station asv2018-09.jpg|[[Elektrozavodskaya (Moscow Metro)|Elektrozavodskaya]]\nFile:Metro MSK Line3 Baumanskaya.jpg|[[Baumanskaya (Moscow Metro)|Baumanskaya]]\nFile:Parkpobedy-mm01.jpg|[[Park Pobedy (Moscow Metro)|Park Pobedy]]\nFile:\u0422\u0430\u0433\u0430\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f-\u043a\u043e\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0435\u0432\u0430\u044f 07.jpg|[[Taganskaya (Koltsevaya line)|Taganskaya]]\nFile:MoscowMetro ProspektMiraKoltsevaya HC3b.jpg|[[Prospekt Mira (Koltsevaya line)|Prospekt Mira]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Lines==\n[[File:Moscow metro tunnels - view from cab of Synergy train.webm|thumbtime=5:47|thumb|A Moscow Metro train passes through [[Sokolnicheskaya line|Sokolnicheskaya]] and [[Koltsevaya Line|Koltsevaya]] lines.

In 1923, the Moscow City Council formed the Underground Railway Design Office at the Moscow Board of Urban Railways. It carried out preliminary studies, and by 1928 had developed a project for the first route from Sokolniki to the city centre. At the same time, an offer was made to the German company Siemens Bauunion to submit its own project for the same route. In June 1931, the decision to begin construction of the Moscow Metro was made by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. In January 1932 the plan for the first lines was approved, and on 21 March 1933 the Soviet government approved a plan for 10 lines with a total route length of {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first lines were built using the Moscow general plan designed by [[Lazar Kaganovich]], along with his project managers (notably Ivan M. Kuznetsov and, later, Isaac Y. Segal) in the 1930s-1950s, and the Metro was named after him until 1955 ''({{lang|ru-Latn|Metropoliten im. L.M.

In March 1938, the Arbatskaya branch was split and extended to the [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]] station (now the dark-blue [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]). In September 1938, the [[Zamoskvoretskaya Line|Gorkovskaya Line]] opened between [[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol]] and [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]. Here the architecture was based on that of the most popular stations in existence (Krasniye Vorota, Okhotnyi Ryad and Kropotkinskaya); while following the popular art-deco style, it was merged with socialist themes. The first [[Deep column station|deep-level column station]] [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] was built at the same time.\n\nBuilding work on the third stage was delayed (but not interrupted) during [[World War II]], and two Metro sections were put into service; [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]\u2013[[Avtozavodskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line)|Avtozavodskaya]] (three stations, crossing the Moskva River through a deep tunnel) and [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]]\u2013[[Partizanskaya (Metro)|Partizanskaya]] (four stations) were inaugurated in 1943 and 1944 respectively. War motifs replaced socialist visions in the architectural design of these stations. During the [[Battle of Moscow|Siege of Moscow]] in the fall and winter of 1941, Metro stations were used as air-raid shelters; the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]] moved its offices to the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] platforms, where Stalin made public speeches on several occasions. The [[Chistye Prudy (Metro)|Chistiye Prudy]] station was also walled off, and the headquarters of the Air Defence established there.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, construction began on the fourth stage of the Metro, which included the [[Koltsevaya Line]], a deep part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line from [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] to [[Kievskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya)|Kievskaya]] and a surface extension to [[Pervomaiskaya (closed)|Pervomaiskaya]] during the early 1950s. The decoration and design characteristic of the Moscow Metro is considered to have reached its zenith in these stations. The [[Koltsevaya Line]] was first planned as a line running under the [[Garden Ring]], a wide avenue encircling the borders of Moscow's city centre. The first part of the line \u2013 from [[Park Kultury (Koltsevaya Line)|Park Kultury]] to [[Kurskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Kurskaya]] (1950) \u2013 follows this avenue. Plans were later changed and the northern part of the ring line runs {{convert|1|-|1.5|km}} outside the Sadovoye Koltso, thus providing service for seven (out of nine) rail terminals. The next part of the Koltsevaya Line opened in 1952 (Kurskaya\u2013[[Belorusskaya-Koltsevaya|Belorusskaya]]), and in 1954 the ring line was completed.\n\n===Cold War era===\n[[File:Novoslobodskaya 04.jpg|thumb|left|Novoslobodskaya station]]\n[[File:MosMetro KomsomolskayaKL img2 asv2018-01.jpg|thumb| [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Komsomolskaya station]]]]\n[[File:Metro MSK Line2 Sokol.jpg|thumb|[[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol station]]]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cold War]] led to the construction of a deep section of the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]. The stations on this line were planned as shelters in the event of nuclear war. After finishing the line in 1953 the upper tracks between [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] and [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] were closed, and later reopened in 1958 as a part of the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. In the further development of the Metro the term \"stages\" was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957\u20131959 are referred to as the \"fifth stage\".\n\nOther stations, too, were supplied with tight gates and life-sustenance systems to function as nuclear shelters.\n\nDuring the late 1950s the architectural extravagance of new Metro stations was toned down, and decorations at some stations (such as [[VDNKh (Metro)|VDNKh]] and [[Alexeyevskaya (Metro)|Alexeyevskaya]]) were simplified by comparison with the original plans. This was done on the orders of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who favoured more spartan decoration. A typical layout (which quickly became known as ''Sorokonozhka''\u2013\"centipede\", from early designs with 40 concrete columns in two rows) was developed for all new stations and the stations were built to look almost identical, differing from each other only in colours of the marble and ceramic tiles. Most stations were built with simpler, less-costly technology; this was not always appropriate, and resulted in utilitarian design. For example, walls with cheap ceramic tiles were susceptible to train vibration and some tiles eventually fell off. It was not always possible to replace the missing tiles with the ones of the same color, which eventually led to [[:wikt:variegated|variegated]] parts of the walls. Not until the mid-1970s was the architectural extravagance restored and original designs again popular. However, the newer design of \"centipede\" stations (with 26 columns, more widely spaced) continued to dominate.\n\n===Stalinist ideals===\n{{see also|Stalinist architecture}}\n\n====Publicizing the metro====\nThe Moscow Metro was one of the USSR's most ambitious architectural projects. The metro's artists and architects worked to design a structure that embodied ''svet'' (radiance or brilliance) and ''svetloe budushchee'' (a radiant future).<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\">{{cite journal |last=Cooke |first=Catherine |title=Beauty as a Route to 'the Radiant Future': Responses of Soviet Architecture |journal=Journal of Design History |year=1997 |volume=10 |series=Design, Stalin and the Thaw |issue=2 |pages=137\u2013160 |jstor=1316129 |doi=10.1093/jdh/10.2.137}}</ref> With their reflective marble walls, high ceilings and grand chandeliers, many Moscow Metro stations have been likened to an \"artificial underground sun\".<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\">{{cite journal |last=Bowlt |first=John E. |title=Stalin as Isis and Ra: Socialist Realism and the Art of Design |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |year=2002 |volume=24 |series=Design, Culture, Identity: The Wolfsonian Collection |pages=34\u201363 |jstor=1504182 |doi=10.2307/1504182}}</ref> This palatial underground environment<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\"/> reminded riders that their tax rubles had been well spent on ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\nThe chief lighting engineer was Abram Damsky, a graduate of the Higher State Art-Technical Institute in Moscow. By 1930 he was a chief designer in Moscow's Elektrosvet Factory, and during World War II was sent to the ''Metrostroi'' (Metro Construction) Factory as head of the lighting shop.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\">{{cite journal |last=Damsky |first=Abram |title=Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950 |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |date=Summer 1987 |volume=5 |issue=Russian/Soviet Theme |pages=90\u2013111 |jstor=1503938 |doi=10.2307/1503938}}</ref> Damsky recognized the importance of efficiency, as well as the potential for light as an expressive form. His team experimented with different materials (most often cast bronze, aluminum, sheet brass, steel, and milk glass) and methods to optimize the technology.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/> Damsky's discourse on \"Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950\" describes in detail the epic chandeliers installed in the Kaluzhskaia (now called the Oktiabrskaia) Station and the Taganskaia Station:\n\n{{quote|The Kaluzhskaya Station was designed by the architect [Leonid] Poliakov. Poliakov's decision to base his design on a reinterpretation of Russian classical architecture clearly influenced the concept of the lamps, some of which I planned in collaboration with the architect himself. The shape of the lamps was a torch \u2013 the torch of victory, as Poliakov put it... The artistic quality and stylistic unity of all the lamps throughout the station's interior made them perhaps the most successful element of the architectural composition. All were made of cast aluminum decorated in a black and gold anodized coating, a technique which the Metrostroi factory had only just mastered.\n<br /> \nThe Taganskaia Metro Station on the Ring Line was designed in...quite another style by the architects K.S. Ryzhkov and A. Medvedev... Their subject matter dealt with images of war and victory...The overall effect was one of ceremony ... In the platform halls the blue ceramic bodies of the chandeliers played a more modest role, but still emphasised the overall expressiveness of the lamp.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/>|Abram Damsky|Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950}}\n\nThe work of Abram Damsky further publicized these ideas hoping people would associate the party with ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\n====Industrialization====\nStalin's [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131932) facilitated rapid industrialization to build a socialist motherland. The plan was ambitious, seeking to reorient an agrarian society towards industrialism. It was Stalin's fanatical energy, large-scale planning, and smart resource distribution that kept up the incredible pace of industrialization. The first five-year plan was instrumental in the completion of the Moscow Metro; without industrialization, the Soviet Union would not have had the raw materials necessary for the project. For example, steel was a main component of many subway stations. Before industrialization, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to produce enough [[steel]] to incorporate it into the metro's design; in addition, a steel shortage would have limited the size of the subway system and its technological advancement.\n\nThe Moscow Metro furthered the construction of a socialist Soviet Union because the project accorded with Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union#Second Plan, 1933\u20131937|second five-year plan]]. The Second Plan focused on urbanization and the development of social services. The Moscow Metro was necessary to cope with the influx of peasants who migrated to the city during the 1930s; Moscow's population had grown from 2.16 million in 1928 to 3.6 million in 1933.  The Metro also bolstered Moscow's shaky infrastructure and its communal services, which hitherto were nearly nonexistent.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\">{{cite journal |last=Jenks |first=Andrew |title=A Metro on the Mount: The Underground as a Church of Soviet Civilization |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 2000 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=697\u2013724 |jstor=2517594 |doi=10.1353/tech.2000.0160}}</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nThe [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] had the power to mobilize; because the party was a single source of control, it could focus its resources and inspire its people. The most notable example of mobilization in the Soviet Union occurred during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]. The country also mobilized in order to complete the Moscow Metro with unprecedented speed. One of the main motivation factors of the mobilization was to overtake the West and prove that a socialist metro could surpass capitalist designs. It was especially important to the Soviet Union that socialism succeed industrially, technologically, and artistically in the 1930s, since capitalism was at a low ebb during the Great Depression.\n\nThe person in charge of Metro mobilization was [[Lazar Kaganovich]]. A prominent Party member, he assumed control of the project as chief overseer. Kaganovich was nicknamed the \"Iron Commissar\"; he shared Stalin's fanatical energy, dramatic oratory flare, and ability to keep workers building quickly with threats and punishment.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> He was determined to realise the Moscow Metro, regardless of cost. Without Kaganovich's managerial ability, the Moscow Metro might have met the same fate as the [[Palace of the soviets|Palace of the Soviets]]: failure.\n\nThis was a comprehensive mobilization; the project drew resources and workers from the entire Soviet Union. In his article, archeologist Mike O'Mahoney describes the scope of the Metro mobilization:\n\n{{quote|A specialist workforce had been drawn from many different regions, including miners from the Ukrainian and Siberian coalfields and construction workers from the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk, the Dniepr hydroelectric power station, and the Turkestan-Siberian railway... materials used in the construction of the metro included iron from Siberian Kuznetsk, timber from northern Russia, cement from the Volga region and the norther Caucasus, bitumen from Baku, and marble and granite from quarries in Karelia, the Crimea, the Caucasus, the Urals, and the Soviet Far East<ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Mahoney |first=Mike |title=Archaeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro |journal=The Modern Language Review |date=January 2003 |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=138\u2013150 |jstor=3738180 |doi=10.2307/3738180}}</ref>|Mike O'Mahoney|Archeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro}}\n\nSkilled engineers were scarce, and unskilled workers were instrumental to the realization of the metro. The ''Metrostroi'' (the organization responsible for the Metro's construction) conducted massive recruitment campaigns. It printed 15,000 copies of ''Udarnik metrostroia'' (''Metrostroi Shock Worker'', its daily newspaper) and 700 other newsletters (some in different languages) to attract unskilled laborers. Kaganovich was closely involved in the recruitment campaign, targeting the [[Komsomol]] generation because of its strength and youth.\n\n====Patriotic influences====\nWhen the Metro opened in 1935 it immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that, it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and physical prowess on the powerful new \"[[Homo Sovieticus]]\" (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel W\u00fcnsche, \"Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station,\" ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90</ref> The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, \"A Metro on the Mount,\" ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p</ref>\n\nThe Metro was iconic also because it showcased [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realism]] in public art. Socialist Realism was in fact a method, not a style.<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\"/> This method was influenced by [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] favorite 19th-century [[Nihilist movement|nihilist]], who stated that \"art is no use unless it serves politics\".<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> This maxim explains why the stations combined aesthetics, technology and ideology. Any plan which did not incorporate all three areas cohesively was rejected. Without this cohesion, the Metro would not reflect Socialist Realism. If the Metro did not utilize Socialist Realism, it would fail to illustrate Stalinist values and transform Soviet citizens into socialists. Anything less than Socialist Realism's grand artistic complexity would fail to inspire a long-lasting, nationalistic attachment to Stalin's new society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Voyce |first=Arthur |title=Soviet Art and Architecture: Recent Developments |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=January 1956 |volume=303 |series=Russia Since Stalin: Old Trends and New Problems |pages=104\u2013115 |jstor=1032295 |doi=10.1177/000271625630300110}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Central Circle urban railway (Line 14)===\n{{main|Moscow Central Circle}}\n[[File:MCC 12LUZH 7041 PLAT.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, light outdoor station|[[Luzhniki (Moscow Central Circle)|Luzhniki]] MCC station]]\nA proposal to convert the [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]] into a [[Urban rail transit|metropolitan railway]] with frequent passenger service was announced in 2012.

Effective February 2017, one ride costs 55 rubles (approx. 1 US dollar). Discounts (up to 33 percent) are available when buying a multiple-trip ticket (starting with twenty-trip cards), and children under age seven can travel free with their parents.\n\nTickets are available for a fixed number of trips, regardless of distance traveled or number of transfers. Monthly and yearly passes are also available. Fare enforcement takes place at the points of entry. Once a passenger has entered the Metro system, there are no further ticket checks \u2013 one can ride to any number of stations and make transfers within the system freely. Transfers to other public-transport systems (such as bus, tram, trolleybus) are not covered by the ticket. Transfer to monorail is free within 90 minutes.\n\nBefore 1991, turnstiles accepted coins; however, with the start of [[hyperinflation]] plastic tokens of various design were used. Disposable [[magnetic stripe card]]s were introduced in 1993 on a trial basis, and used as unlimited monthly tickets between 1996 and 1998. The sale of tokens ended on 1 January 1999, and they stopped being accepted in February 1999; from that time, magnetic cards were used as tickets with a fixed number of trips.\n\nOn 1 September 1998, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to fully implement contactless [[smart cards]], known as Transport Cards. The card has an unlimited number of trips and may be programmed for 30, 90 or 365 days. The first purchase includes a one-time cost of 50 rubles, and its active lifetime is projected as 3\u00bd years; defective cards are exchanged at no cost. Unlimited cards are also available for students at reduced price (as of 2017, 365 rubles\u2014or about $US6\u2014for a calendar month of unlimited usage) for a one-time cost of 70 rubles. Transport Cards impose a delay for each consecutive use; i.e. the card can not be used for seven minutes after the user has passed through the turnstile.\n\nIn January 2007, Moscow Metro began replacing magnetic cards with [[Smart card#Contactless smart cards|contactless]] disposable tickets based on [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP's]] [[MIFARE|MIFARE Ultralight]] technology. Ultralight tickets are available for a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards stopped 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contactless automatic fare-collection system.<ref name=mifareinmoscow>{{cite web |url=http://www.nxp.com/news/content/file_1518.html |title=Moscow Metro: the World's First Major Transport System to operate fully contactless with NXP's MIFARE Technology |publisher=[[NXP Semiconductors]] |accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, the [[Government of Moscow|city government]] launched the Muscovite's Social Card program. Social Cards are free smart cards issued for the elderly and other groups of citizens officially registered as residents of Moscow or the [[Moscow region]]; they offer discounts in shops and pharmacies, and double as credit cards issued by the [[Bank of Moscow]]. Social Cards can be used for unlimited free access to the city's public-transport system, including the Moscow Metro; while they do not feature the time delay, they include a photograph and are non-transferable.\n\nSince 2006, [[Banking in Russia|several banks]] have issued [[credit card]]s which double as Ultralight cards and are accepted at turnstiles. The fare is passed to the bank and the payment is withdrawn from the owner's bank account at the end of the calendar month, using a discount rate based on the number of trips that month (for up to 70 trips, the cost of each trip is prorated from current Ultralight rates; each additional trip costs 24.14 rubles).<ref name=rates_2010/> Partner banks include the [[Bank of Moscow]], [[CitiBank]], [[Rosbank]], [[Alfa-Bank]] and [[Avangard Bank]].<ref name=creditcards>{{cite web |url=http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |title=\u0411\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 |publisher=Moscow metro |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727014525/http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 2013 Moscow Transport Department introduced a smart card based transport electronic wallet called ''Troika''.

In 1923, the Moscow City Council formed the Underground Railway Design Office at the Moscow Board of Urban Railways. It carried out preliminary studies, and by 1928 had developed a project for the first route from Sokolniki to the city centre. At the same time, an offer was made to the German company Siemens Bauunion to submit its own project for the same route. In June 1931, the decision to begin construction of the Moscow Metro was made by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. In January 1932 the plan for the first lines was approved, and on 21 March 1933 the Soviet government approved a plan for 10 lines with a total route length of {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first lines were built using the Moscow general plan designed by [[Lazar Kaganovich]], along with his project managers (notably Ivan M.

In March 1938, the Arbatskaya branch was split and extended to the [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]] station (now the dark-blue [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]). In September 1938, the [[Zamoskvoretskaya Line|Gorkovskaya Line]] opened between [[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol]] and [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]. Here the architecture was based on that of the most popular stations in existence (Krasniye Vorota, Okhotnyi Ryad and Kropotkinskaya); while following the popular art-deco style, it was merged with socialist themes. The first [[Deep column station|deep-level column station]] [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] was built at the same time.\n\nBuilding work on the third stage was delayed (but not interrupted) during [[World War II]], and two Metro sections were put into service; [[Teatralnaya (Moscow Metro)|Teatralnaya]]\u2013[[Avtozavodskaya (Zamoskvoretskaya Line)|Avtozavodskaya]] (three stations, crossing the Moskva River through a deep tunnel) and [[Kurskaya-Radialnaya|Kurskaya]]\u2013[[Partizanskaya (Metro)|Partizanskaya]] (four stations) were inaugurated in 1943 and 1944 respectively. War motifs replaced socialist visions in the architectural design of these stations. During the [[Battle of Moscow|Siege of Moscow]] in the fall and winter of 1941, Metro stations were used as air-raid shelters; the [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]] moved its offices to the [[Mayakovskaya (Moscow Metro)|Mayakovskaya]] platforms, where Stalin made public speeches on several occasions. The [[Chistye Prudy (Metro)|Chistiye Prudy]] station was also walled off, and the headquarters of the Air Defence established there.\n\nAfter the war ended in 1945, construction began on the fourth stage of the Metro, which included the [[Koltsevaya Line]], a deep part of the Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya line from [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] to [[Kievskaya (Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya)|Kievskaya]] and a surface extension to [[Pervomaiskaya (closed)|Pervomaiskaya]] during the early 1950s. The decoration and design characteristic of the Moscow Metro is considered to have reached its zenith in these stations. The [[Koltsevaya Line]] was first planned as a line running under the [[Garden Ring]], a wide avenue encircling the borders of Moscow's city centre. The first part of the line \u2013 from [[Park Kultury (Koltsevaya Line)|Park Kultury]] to [[Kurskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Kurskaya]] (1950) \u2013 follows this avenue. Plans were later changed and the northern part of the ring line runs {{convert|1|-|1.5|km}} outside the Sadovoye Koltso, thus providing service for seven (out of nine) rail terminals. The next part of the Koltsevaya Line opened in 1952 (Kurskaya\u2013[[Belorusskaya-Koltsevaya|Belorusskaya]]), and in 1954 the ring line was completed.\n\n===Cold War era===\n[[File:Novoslobodskaya 04.jpg|thumb|left|Novoslobodskaya station]]\n[[File:MosMetro KomsomolskayaKL img2 asv2018-01.jpg|thumb| [[Komsomolskaya (Koltsevaya Line)|Komsomolskaya station]]]]\n[[File:Metro MSK Line2 Sokol.jpg|thumb|[[Sokol (Metro)|Sokol station]]]]\nThe beginning of the [[Cold War]] led to the construction of a deep section of the [[Arbatsko-Pokrovskaya Line]]. The stations on this line were planned as shelters in the event of nuclear war. After finishing the line in 1953 the upper tracks between [[Ploshchad Revolyutsii]] and [[Kiyevskaya (Filyovskaya)|Kiyevskaya]] were closed, and later reopened in 1958 as a part of the [[Filyovskaya Line]]. In the further development of the Metro the term \"stages\" was not used any more, although sometimes the stations opened in 1957\u20131959 are referred to as the \"fifth stage\".\n\nOther stations, too, were supplied with tight gates and life-sustenance systems to function as nuclear shelters.\n\nDuring the late 1950s the architectural extravagance of new Metro stations was toned down, and decorations at some stations (such as [[VDNKh (Metro)|VDNKh]] and [[Alexeyevskaya (Metro)|Alexeyevskaya]]) were simplified by comparison with the original plans. This was done on the orders of [[Nikita Khrushchev]], who favoured more spartan decoration. A typical layout (which quickly became known as ''Sorokonozhka''\u2013\"centipede\", from early designs with 40 concrete columns in two rows) was developed for all new stations and the stations were built to look almost identical, differing from each other only in colours of the marble and ceramic tiles. Most stations were built with simpler, less-costly technology; this was not always appropriate, and resulted in utilitarian design. For example, walls with cheap ceramic tiles were susceptible to train vibration and some tiles eventually fell off. It was not always possible to replace the missing tiles with the ones of the same color, which eventually led to [[:wikt:variegated|variegated]] parts of the walls. Not until the mid-1970s was the architectural extravagance restored and original designs again popular. However, the newer design of \"centipede\" stations (with 26 columns, more widely spaced) continued to dominate.\n\n===Stalinist ideals===\n{{see also|Stalinist architecture}}\n\n====Publicizing the metro====\nThe Moscow Metro was one of the USSR's most ambitious architectural projects. The metro's artists and architects worked to design a structure that embodied ''svet'' (radiance or brilliance) and ''svetloe budushchee'' (a radiant future).<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\">{{cite journal |last=Cooke |first=Catherine |title=Beauty as a Route to 'the Radiant Future': Responses of Soviet Architecture |journal=Journal of Design History |year=1997 |volume=10 |series=Design, Stalin and the Thaw |issue=2 |pages=137\u2013160 |jstor=1316129 |doi=10.1093/jdh/10.2.137}}</ref> With their reflective marble walls, high ceilings and grand chandeliers, many Moscow Metro stations have been likened to an \"artificial underground sun\".<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\">{{cite journal |last=Bowlt |first=John E. |title=Stalin as Isis and Ra: Socialist Realism and the Art of Design |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |year=2002 |volume=24 |series=Design, Culture, Identity: The Wolfsonian Collection |pages=34\u201363 |jstor=1504182 |doi=10.2307/1504182}}</ref> This palatial underground environment<ref name=\"Bowlt 2002 34\u201363\"/> reminded riders that their tax rubles had been well spent on ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\nThe chief lighting engineer was Abram Damsky, a graduate of the Higher State Art-Technical Institute in Moscow. By 1930 he was a chief designer in Moscow's Elektrosvet Factory, and during World War II was sent to the ''Metrostroi'' (Metro Construction) Factory as head of the lighting shop.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\">{{cite journal |last=Damsky |first=Abram |title=Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950 |journal=The Journal of Decorative and Propaganda Arts |date=Summer 1987 |volume=5 |issue=Russian/Soviet Theme |pages=90\u2013111 |jstor=1503938 |doi=10.2307/1503938}}</ref> Damsky recognized the importance of efficiency, as well as the potential for light as an expressive form.

Poliakov's decision to base his design on a reinterpretation of Russian classical architecture clearly influenced the concept of the lamps, some of which I planned in collaboration with the architect himself. The shape of the lamps was a torch \u2013 the torch of victory, as Poliakov put it... The artistic quality and stylistic unity of all the lamps throughout the station's interior made them perhaps the most successful element of the architectural composition. All were made of cast aluminum decorated in a black and gold anodized coating, a technique which the Metrostroi factory had only just mastered.\n<br /> \nThe Taganskaia Metro Station on the Ring Line was designed in...quite another style by the architects K.S. Ryzhkov and A. Medvedev... Their subject matter dealt with images of war and victory...The overall effect was one of ceremony ... In the platform halls the blue ceramic bodies of the chandeliers played a more modest role, but still emphasised the overall expressiveness of the lamp.<ref name=\"Damsky 1987 90\u2013111\"/>|Abram Damsky|Lamps and Architecture 1930\u20131950}}\n\nThe work of Abram Damsky further publicized these ideas hoping people would associate the party with ''svetloe budushchee''.\n\n====Industrialization====\nStalin's [[first five-year plan]] (1928\u20131932) facilitated rapid industrialization to build a socialist motherland. The plan was ambitious, seeking to reorient an agrarian society towards industrialism. It was Stalin's fanatical energy, large-scale planning, and smart resource distribution that kept up the incredible pace of industrialization. The first five-year plan was instrumental in the completion of the Moscow Metro; without industrialization, the Soviet Union would not have had the raw materials necessary for the project. For example, steel was a main component of many subway stations. Before industrialization, it would have been impossible for the Soviet Union to produce enough [[steel]] to incorporate it into the metro's design; in addition, a steel shortage would have limited the size of the subway system and its technological advancement.\n\nThe Moscow Metro furthered the construction of a socialist Soviet Union because the project accorded with Stalin's [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union#Second Plan, 1933\u20131937|second five-year plan]]. The Second Plan focused on urbanization and the development of social services. The Moscow Metro was necessary to cope with the influx of peasants who migrated to the city during the 1930s; Moscow's population had grown from 2.16 million in 1928 to 3.6 million in 1933.  The Metro also bolstered Moscow's shaky infrastructure and its communal services, which hitherto were nearly nonexistent.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\">{{cite journal |last=Jenks |first=Andrew |title=A Metro on the Mount: The Underground as a Church of Soviet Civilization |journal=Technology and Culture |date=October 2000 |volume=41 |issue=4 |pages=697\u2013724 |jstor=2517594 |doi=10.1353/tech.2000.0160}}</ref>\n\n====Mobilization====\nThe [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] had the power to mobilize; because the party was a single source of control, it could focus its resources and inspire its people. The most notable example of mobilization in the Soviet Union occurred during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]]. The country also mobilized in order to complete the Moscow Metro with unprecedented speed. One of the main motivation factors of the mobilization was to overtake the West and prove that a socialist metro could surpass capitalist designs. It was especially important to the Soviet Union that socialism succeed industrially, technologically, and artistically in the 1930s, since capitalism was at a low ebb during the Great Depression.\n\nThe person in charge of Metro mobilization was [[Lazar Kaganovich]]. A prominent Party member, he assumed control of the project as chief overseer. Kaganovich was nicknamed the \"Iron Commissar\"; he shared Stalin's fanatical energy, dramatic oratory flare, and ability to keep workers building quickly with threats and punishment.<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> He was determined to realise the Moscow Metro, regardless of cost. Without Kaganovich's managerial ability, the Moscow Metro might have met the same fate as the [[Palace of the soviets|Palace of the Soviets]]: failure.\n\nThis was a comprehensive mobilization; the project drew resources and workers from the entire Soviet Union. In his article, archeologist Mike O'Mahoney describes the scope of the Metro mobilization:\n\n{{quote|A specialist workforce had been drawn from many different regions, including miners from the Ukrainian and Siberian coalfields and construction workers from the iron and steel mills of Magnitogorsk, the Dniepr hydroelectric power station, and the Turkestan-Siberian railway... materials used in the construction of the metro included iron from Siberian Kuznetsk, timber from northern Russia, cement from the Volga region and the norther Caucasus, bitumen from Baku, and marble and granite from quarries in Karelia, the Crimea, the Caucasus, the Urals, and the Soviet Far East<ref>{{cite journal |last=O'Mahoney |first=Mike |title=Archaeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro |journal=The Modern Language Review |date=January 2003 |volume=98 |issue=1 |pages=138\u2013150 |jstor=3738180 |doi=10.2307/3738180}}</ref>|Mike O'Mahoney|Archeological Fantasies: Constructing History on the Moscow Metro}}\n\nSkilled engineers were scarce, and unskilled workers were instrumental to the realization of the metro. The ''Metrostroi'' (the organization responsible for the Metro's construction) conducted massive recruitment campaigns. It printed 15,000 copies of ''Udarnik metrostroia'' (''Metrostroi Shock Worker'', its daily newspaper) and 700 other newsletters (some in different languages) to attract unskilled laborers. Kaganovich was closely involved in the recruitment campaign, targeting the [[Komsomol]] generation because of its strength and youth.\n\n====Patriotic influences====\nWhen the Metro opened in 1935 it immediately became the centrepiece of the transportation system. More than that, it was a Stalinist device to awe and control the populace, and give them an appreciation of Soviet realist art. It became the prototype for future Soviet large-scale technologies. Kaganovich was in charge; he designed the subway so that citizens would absorb the values and ethos of Stalinist civilization as they rode. The artwork of the 13 original stations became nationally and internationally famous. For example, the Sverdlov Square subway station featured porcelain bas-reliefs depicting the daily life of the Soviet peoples, and the bas-reliefs at the Dynamo Stadium sports complex glorified sports and physical prowess on the powerful new \"[[Homo Sovieticus]]\" (Soviet man).<ref>Isabel W\u00fcnsche, \"Homo Sovieticus: The Athletic Motif in the Design of the Dynamo Metro Station,\" ''Studies in the Decorative Arts'' (2000) 7#2 pp 65-90</ref> The metro was touted as the symbol of the new social order\u2014a sort of Communist cathedral of engineering modernity.<ref>Andrew Jenks, \"A Metro on the Mount,\" ''Technology & Culture'' (2000) 41#4 pp 697-723p</ref>\n\nThe Metro was iconic also because it showcased [[Socialist realism|Socialist Realism]] in public art. Socialist Realism was in fact a method, not a style.<ref name=\"Cooke 1997 137\u2013160\"/> This method was influenced by [[Nikolay Chernyshevsky]], [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin's]] favorite 19th-century [[Nihilist movement|nihilist]], who stated that \"art is no use unless it serves politics\".<ref name=\"Jenks 2000 697\u2013724\"/> This maxim explains why the stations combined aesthetics, technology and ideology. Any plan which did not incorporate all three areas cohesively was rejected. Without this cohesion, the Metro would not reflect Socialist Realism. If the Metro did not utilize Socialist Realism, it would fail to illustrate Stalinist values and transform Soviet citizens into socialists. Anything less than Socialist Realism's grand artistic complexity would fail to inspire a long-lasting, nationalistic attachment to Stalin's new society.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Voyce |first=Arthur |title=Soviet Art and Architecture: Recent Developments |journal=Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science |date=January 1956 |volume=303 |series=Russia Since Stalin: Old Trends and New Problems |pages=104\u2013115 |jstor=1032295 |doi=10.1177/000271625630300110}}</ref>\n\n===Moscow Central Circle urban railway (Line 14)===\n{{main|Moscow Central Circle}}\n[[File:MCC 12LUZH 7041 PLAT.jpg|thumb|alt=Large, light outdoor station|[[Luzhniki (Moscow Central Circle)|Luzhniki]] MCC station]]\nA proposal to convert the [[Little Ring of the Moscow Railway]] into a [[Urban rail transit|metropolitan railway]] with frequent passenger service was announced in 2012.

The fare has been steadily rising since 1991, hastened by [[inflation]] (taking into account the [[Monetary reform in Russia, 1998|1998 revaluation]] of the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] by a factor of 1,000). Effective February 2017, one ride costs 55 rubles (approx. 1 US dollar). Discounts (up to 33 percent) are available when buying a multiple-trip ticket (starting with twenty-trip cards), and children under age seven can travel free with their parents.\n\nTickets are available for a fixed number of trips, regardless of distance traveled or number of transfers. Monthly and yearly passes are also available. Fare enforcement takes place at the points of entry. Once a passenger has entered the Metro system, there are no further ticket checks \u2013 one can ride to any number of stations and make transfers within the system freely. Transfers to other public-transport systems (such as bus, tram, trolleybus) are not covered by the ticket. Transfer to monorail is free within 90 minutes.\n\nBefore 1991, turnstiles accepted coins; however, with the start of [[hyperinflation]] plastic tokens of various design were used. Disposable [[magnetic stripe card]]s were introduced in 1993 on a trial basis, and used as unlimited monthly tickets between 1996 and 1998. The sale of tokens ended on 1 January 1999, and they stopped being accepted in February 1999; from that time, magnetic cards were used as tickets with a fixed number of trips.\n\nOn 1 September 1998, the Moscow Metro became the first metro system in Europe to fully implement contactless [[smart cards]], known as Transport Cards. The card has an unlimited number of trips and may be programmed for 30, 90 or 365 days. The first purchase includes a one-time cost of 50 rubles, and its active lifetime is projected as 3\u00bd years; defective cards are exchanged at no cost. Unlimited cards are also available for students at reduced price (as of 2017, 365 rubles\u2014or about $US6\u2014for a calendar month of unlimited usage) for a one-time cost of 70 rubles. Transport Cards impose a delay for each consecutive use; i.e. the card can not be used for seven minutes after the user has passed through the turnstile.\n\nIn January 2007, Moscow Metro began replacing magnetic cards with [[Smart card#Contactless smart cards|contactless]] disposable tickets based on [[NXP Semiconductors|NXP's]] [[MIFARE|MIFARE Ultralight]] technology. Ultralight tickets are available for a fixed number of trips in 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 60-trip denominations (valid for 5 or 90 days from the day of purchase) and as a monthly ticket, only valid for a selected calendar month and limited to 70 trips. The sale of magnetic cards stopped 16 January 2008 and magnetic cards stopped being accepted in late 2008, making the Moscow metro the world's first major public-transport system to run exclusively on a contactless automatic fare-collection system.<ref name=mifareinmoscow>{{cite web |url=http://www.nxp.com/news/content/file_1518.html |title=Moscow Metro: the World's First Major Transport System to operate fully contactless with NXP's MIFARE Technology |publisher=[[NXP Semiconductors]] |accessdate=26 January 2009}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2004, the [[Government of Moscow|city government]] launched the Muscovite's Social Card program. Social Cards are free smart cards issued for the elderly and other groups of citizens officially registered as residents of Moscow or the [[Moscow region]]; they offer discounts in shops and pharmacies, and double as credit cards issued by the [[Bank of Moscow]]. Social Cards can be used for unlimited free access to the city's public-transport system, including the Moscow Metro; while they do not feature the time delay, they include a photograph and are non-transferable.\n\nSince 2006, [[Banking in Russia|several banks]] have issued [[credit card]]s which double as Ultralight cards and are accepted at turnstiles. The fare is passed to the bank and the payment is withdrawn from the owner's bank account at the end of the calendar month, using a discount rate based on the number of trips that month (for up to 70 trips, the cost of each trip is prorated from current Ultralight rates; each additional trip costs 24.14 rubles).<ref name=rates_2010/> Partner banks include the [[Bank of Moscow]], [[CitiBank]], [[Rosbank]], [[Alfa-Bank]] and [[Avangard Bank]].<ref name=creditcards>{{cite web |url=http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |title=\u0411\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430\u043b\u0438\u0447\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0441\u0438\u0441\u0442\u0435\u043c\u0430 \u043e\u043f\u043b\u0430\u0442\u044b \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0435\u0437\u0434\u0430 |publisher=Moscow metro |accessdate=20 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727014525/http://old.mosmetro.ru/pages/page_0.php?id_page=779 |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 2 April 2013 Moscow Transport Department introduced a smart card based transport electronic wallet called ''Troika''.
