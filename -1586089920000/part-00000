Founded in 1896, it is Alabama's only public [[liberal arts college]] and a member of the [[Council of Public Liberal Arts Colleges]]. The [[University of Montevallo Historic District]] was established in 1979 and included 16 buildings on campus. It was expanded in 1990 to include 75 buildings total.\n\n==History==\n[[File:King House University of Montevallo Montevallo, AL.JPG|thumb|left|Built in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in 1823, the King House is the oldest building on campus,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dev.montevallo.edu/visitors/TheRedBrickTours/AWalkThroughTime/5-KingHouse.shtm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080440/http://dev.montevallo.edu/visitors/TheRedBrickTours/AWalkThroughTime/5-KingHouse.shtm |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places in Shelby County, Alabama|National Register of Historic Places]] on January 14, 1972.]]\n\n{{Infobox NRHP\n| name           = Alabama Girls' Industrial School\n| nrhp_type      = hd\n| image          = King Quad.jpg\n| caption        = King Quad at the University of Montevallo<br>University of Montevallo campus\n| location       = Bounded by Middle Campus Dr., Oak, Bloch and Middle Sts., [[Montevallo, Alabama]]\n| locmapin       = Alabama\n| built          = 1851\n| architect      = \n| architecture   = Colonial Revival, Greek Revival, Federal\n| added          = December 11, 1978\n| area           = {{convert|25.7|acre}}\n| governing_body = Local\n| refnum         = 78000509<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>\n| nocat          = yes\n}}\nThe main part of the campus was designed by the [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted brothers]] and the central part is a historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The university opened in October 1896 as the Alabama Girls' Industrial School (AGIS), a women-only [[technical school]] that also offered [[high school]]-level courses. AGIS became the Alabama Girls' Technical Institute in 1911, further adding \"and College for Women\" in 1919. The school gradually developed as a traditional degree-granting institution, becoming '''Alabama College''', State College for Women in 1923.\n\nThe school effectively became [[coeducation]]al after lobbying by the school's supporters resulted in the [[Alabama Legislature]] passing a bill on January 15, 1956 to remove the designation \"State College for Women\". The first men entered the school that same month. Its student body still maintains a 7:5 ratio of women to men.\n\nIn 1965, the board of trustees authorized President D.P. Culp to sign the Certificates of Assurance of Compliance with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=ency>[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1827 Encyclopedia of Alabama: University of Montevallo], accessed 2010-05-16.</ref> In the fall of 1968, three African American women, Carolyn Burpo, Ruby Kennbrew and Dorothy (Lilly) Turner, enrolled in the university.<ref name=ency/> On September 1, 1969, Alabama College was renamed the University of Montevallo.\n\nThe [[Alabama Girls' Industrial School]] was listed on the National Register in 1978. In 1990, the [[University of Montevallo Historic District]] was listed on the National Register, as an expansion.\n\nMontevallo is in the geographic center of [[Alabama]] in an area rich with [[American Civil War|Civil War]] history. Many of the buildings on campus predate the founding of the college, including King House (reserved for special guests of the campus) and Reynolds Hall (used by the Theater Department and alumni relations). King House was reportedly the first home in Alabama to receive pane glass windows. With nearly 3,000 students, the university has a significant economic impact on the surrounding communities in [[Shelby County, Alabama|Shelby County]].\n\n==Traditions==\n\n=== College Night ===\nThe University of Montevallo's [[homecoming]] tradition is called College Night, a coeducational competition in which students may participate for either the Purple Side or the Gold Side, named after the school's colors. The tradition of College Night began as a celebration of the upcoming renaming of Alabama Girls' Technical Institute to Alabama College. First taking place on March 3, 1919, as a competition between the four classes, the Class of 1919 said that \"now that our school is becoming a college, we have begun to take up college stunts.\"<ref>https://archive.org/details/technala121919unse/page/n31/mode/2up</ref>\n\nThe competition consists of various athletic events, including men's and women's [[basketball]], women's [[volleyball]], and men's [[ultimate frisbee]]. During halftime at the men's basketball game, a cheer competition between the Purple Side and the Gold Side takes place. Both sides craft a sign which is displayed in front of Farmer Hall, the campus's [[student union building]]. The main event of College Night is the series of [[musical theater]] productions, all directed, performed, and produced by student participants. The productions last from Wednesday through Saturday on the week of College Night. It is after the final production on Saturday night when either a Purple Victory or a Gold Victory is declared until the next year's College Night. The victor of College Night is decided based on a system of points derived from each side's degree of sportsmanship, how well they perform in the various events, and how the judges of the student-led productions rate each side's show.\n\nIn honor of A.G.T.I.'s 25th anniversary in 1921, College Night became a competition between two sides, Purple and Gold, instead of a competition between the classes.<ref>Jefferson Walker, ''College Night: A Centennial Celebration'' (Montevallo, AL: University of Montevallo, 2019), 5.</ref> Since then, both sides have adopted mascots; Purple Side adopted the cow as theirs, and Gold Side adopted the lion as theirs. Each side has a song that is sung only when members of the side join hands, forming a circle; whereas Purple Side's circle is connected 360\u00b0 around, Gold Side leaves a small whole in their circle. When \"circled up,\" the leaders of each side \"ask a question\" to all the other members of their respective sides. Purple Side's leaders ask, \"Why is their ''never'' a whole in our circle?\" Their side always responds with, \"Because! A united circle is a united side! Let the circle be unbroken!\" Gold Side's leaders ask their side, \"Why is there ''always'' a whole in our circle?\" Their side responds by saying, \"Because! There's always room for one more Gold!\"\n\nIn 2000, College Night was declared a \"Local Legacy\" by the [[Library of Congress]], with an exhibit containing audio recordings of Purple and Gold side songs, photographs, College Night programs, and other artifacts.<ref>Ibid., 190.</ref>\n\n===Crook Week/Senior March===\n[[File:Main Hall, University of Montevallo.JPG|thumb|left|Main Hall, University of Montevallo]]\nTraditionally, Crook Week was a week in late October when the senior class women would hide the \"crook\"\u2014a staff shaped roughly like a [[shepherd]]'s [[crosier|crook]]\u2014and give obscure clues for the underclass women who were to find it.\n\nAt the end of Crook Week was Senior March. When the chimes struck thirteen, if the underclass women did not find the crook, the seniors march on them, getting them out of their rooms and onto Main Quad where they would have a shaving cream and water balloon battle. If the underclass women found the crook, they were safe that year. This tradition ended in the 1990s because the administration considered it hazing.\n\nToday, the Hiding of the Crook occurs the week of Founders' Day. The administration hides the crook and leaves clues as to where it can be found. The finder of the crook gets recognized at Founders' Day with a small prize.\n\n=== Life Raft Debate ===\nThe Life Raft Debate is an annual event sponsored by the Philosophy Club. The debate has occurred each fall semester since 1998, on the second Thursday in October during the university's Founders' Day commemoration.\n\nIn the Life Raft Debate, the audience is asked to imagine that there has been a nuclear war and that they, as the survivors, are setting sail to rebuild society from the ground up. There are a group of professors vying to win the coveted Oar and get on the raft, and only one seat is left. Each professor has to argue that his or her discipline is the one indispensable area of study that the new civilization will need to flourish.\n[[File:Varagona with oar.jpg|thumb|Scott Varagona with the oar]]\n\nEach professor gets to give an introductory account of his or her discipline then a brief rebuttal to the others. At the end of the debate, the audience votes and the lucky winner claims the Oar and climbs aboard, waving goodbye to the others. Often, a seventh participant, the Devil's Advocate, appears and tries to convince the audience that the entire panel is unworthy and that all should be left behind to drown. In the following year, the defending champion faces five new challengers in a new debate. To date, no one has successfully defended the Oar.\n\nThe first event was held in 1998 before an audience of roughly 200 people. Michael Sterner of the Mathematics Department carried the day with an impassioned defense of his discipline, touting both its usefulness and beauty and promising that, if he were to be saved, there would be \"no more word problems ever.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liferaftdebate.com/|title=University of Montevallo's Life Raft Debate Home Page|author=|date=|website=www.liferaftdebate.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> In the subsequent years the debate's popularity grew to attract more than 800 audience members per year. Following years saw victories by professors from a variety of academic disciplines.\n\nOn March 12, 2010, the public radio show ''[[This American Life]]'' ran a story on the Life Raft Debate entitled \"I'd Like to Spank the Academy.\"<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/402/save-the-day episode 402, ''Save the Day'']</ref> The story followed the events of the 2007 Life Raft Debate in which the Devil's Advocate, Jon Smith, a professor in the Department of English, successfully argued that all the panelists should be drowned because they were merely trying to be funny, not to educate or to defend the importance of their respective disciplines. Following the broadcast, several colleges and universities in the United States and abroad began hosting Life Raft Debates of their own.\n\n==Campus resources==\n===James Wylie Shepherd Observatory===\nThe James Wylie Shepherd Observatory at the University of Montevallo was opened in the Fall of 2009. The observatory was built on the site of a former construction landfill, now remade into Gentry Springs field.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shelbycountyreporter.com/2011/05/26/voting-for-the-stars/ |title=Voting for the stars |last=Hurst |first=Katie |date=26 May 2011 |publisher=[[Shelby County Reporter]] |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> The observatory is a U of M sustainability landmark.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mygreenbirmingham.com/2011/10/montevallo-introduces-a-new-bike-share-program/ |title=Montevallo introduces a new bike share program |date=19 October 2011 |publisher=MyGreenBirmingham.com |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The James Wylie Shepherd Observatory.jpg|thumb|left|The James Wylie Shepherd Observatory is located roughly three miles from the university campus.]]\n\nThe observatory is located roughly three miles from the main campus on the 150-acre Gentry Springs site owned by the university. The JWSO is capable of astronomical telescopic observation and astrophotography, has a dedicated telescope for solar viewing, and is one of very few observatories in the country that is designed specifically to be completely accessible to people of all disabilities.\n\nBesides its observing capabilities, the JWSO will be a [[Green building|green facility]], employing self-composting toilets, filtered rainwater and solar-generated electricity. The facility is currently used by UM classes, the Montevallo Astronomical Society, AMSTI partners and a variety of area K-12 classes and other local groups. There are also regularly-scheduled public viewing nights that are free of charge.\n\nUpon completion, the observing complex will house an outdoor planetarium/amphitheater, a docent's cabin, walking trails, a digital indoor planetarium, a visiting scholar's dormitory, educational exhibits and a visitors' center in which groups can see images generated by the main telescope.  Additional smaller scopes for solar and planetary observing can be set up at various locations outside the main dome, which is surrounded by solar-powered outdoor low-level lighting.\n\n===Ebenezer Swamp Ecological Preserve===\n[[File:Ebenezer Swamp Boardwalk.jpg|thumb|The Ebenezer Swamp Ecological Preserve is located in Shelby County, Alabama. It is maintained by The University of Montevallo for teaching and research.]]\n\nThe University of Montevallo's Ebenezer Swamp consists of approximately {{convert|60|acre|m2}} of wooded wetlands and is located on near the headwaters of Spring Creek, approximately {{convert|6|mi|km}} northeast of the University in central Alabama.\n\nSpring Creek and Ebenezer Swamp form a portion of the headwaters for the ecologically diverse and environmentally sensitive [[Cahaba River]] Watershed. The Cahaba is the longest remaining free-flowing river, has more species of fish per mile than any river in North America and is one of eight river biodiversity hotspots in the U.S.\n\nUM is creating the Ebenezer Swamp Wetlands Interpretive and Research Center (ESWIRC) to focus greater research on wetland ecology and to increase educational opportunities for high school and middle school students from across the state of Alabama.  Research goals center on: establishing and maintaining an inventory of plant, animal and fungal species; monitoring water quality, rainfall and stream flow rates; and future studies of wetland ecological processes and the effects of encroachment along the swamp margin.  Education goals center on raising the profile of the ecologic importance of wetlands to high school and middle school students, while simultaneously providing them with a sound introduction to the underlying principles of biology.\n\n===ValloCycle: Montevallo Bike-Share Program===\nFormed through a collaborative partnership between the City of [[Montevallo]] and the University of Montevallo, the [[ValloCycle Bike-Share Program]] exists as a citywide initiative to enhance overall community walkability and individual citizen engagement with a lifestyle of sustainable, alternative transportation. The ValloCycle Bike-Share Program's primary means of achieving these goals is through its day-to-day operation of the [[ValloCycle Bike-Share Program]], the first county-wide bicycle sharing program in the state of Alabama to offer low-cost bicycle rentals to all the members of its community.\n\nUnlike other nearby campus bike-share programs, ValloCycle bicycle rentals are not limited solely to university students and are also not confined to one location. Rather, bicycle rentals are offered to all residents of Montevallo and the surrounding Shelby County area in three separate check-out locations. Annual membership fees amount to roughly $2 a month for adults and $1 a month per child.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57349669/green-group-tornado-cleanup-a-bright-spot-for-ala/|title=Green Group Tornado Cleanup A Bright Spot For Alabama |date=29 December 2011 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2012/01/birmingham_bike-share_program.html|title=Birmingham Bike Share Program Pedals Into Downtown Life |last=Spencer |first=Tom |date= 2 January 2012 |newspaper=[[Birmingham News]] |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe all-volunteer ValloCycle Board oversees the implementation of a number of other campus and community programs, events, resources and public bicyclist/pedestrian infrastructure enhancements, including the Montevallo \"Share the Lane\" Initiative,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weldbham.com/local/2011/12/16/sharing-the-lanes-new-biking-infrastructure-in-montevallo/ |title=Sharing the lanes: New biking infrastructure in Montevallo |last=Chambers |first= Jesse |date= 16 December 2011 |publisher=[[WELD For Birmingham]] |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> the ValloCycle Town Map Project,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mygreenbirmingham.com/2012/02/vallocycle-creates-town-map-showcases-local-businesses-sustainablity/ |title=Vallocycle Creates Town Map, Showcases Local Businesses & Sustainability |last=Agliata |first=Kate |date=1 February 2012 |publisher=My Green Birmingham |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> and the Montevallo \"Tour By Bike\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://southshelby.myfoxal.com/news/environment/97695-um-celebrates-sustainability-115th-founders-day |title=UM celebrates sustainability at 115th Founder's Day |last=Sides |first=Melinda |date=13 October 2011 |publisher=Fox 6 WBRC |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> Membership forms are available at ValloCycle's public website, vallocycle.com.\n\n===Greek life===\n\n====Interfraternity Council====\n* [[Alpha Kappa Lambda]] (Gamma Delta, 1995)\n* [[Alpha Tau Omega]] (Eta Omega, 1972)\n* [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] (Sigma-Epsilon, 1972)\n* [[Phi Gamma Delta]] (Mu Phi, 2014)\n\n====Panhellenic Council====\n* [[Alpha Delta Pi]] (Zeta Delta, 1971)\n* [[Alpha Gamma Delta]] (Gamma Upsilon, 1972)\n* [[Chi Omega]] (Tau Kappa, 1971)\n* [[Delta Gamma]] (Zeta Nu, 1991)\n* [[Phi Mu]] (Kappa Chi, 1972)\n\n====National Pan-Hellenic Council====\n* [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] (Mu Mu, 1978)\n* [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] (Nu Tau, 1978)\n* [[Delta Sigma Theta]] (Nu Omicron, 1977)\n* [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] (Xi Upsilon, 1995)\n* [[Zeta Phi Beta]] (Tau Pi, 1998)\n\n====Professional fraternity====\n* [[Phi Chi Theta]] (Gamma Tau, 1973)\n\n===Disc golf course===\nIn 2007, The University of Montevallo in cooperation with the Professional Disc Golf Association built a full size, 18 hole, disc golf course on the grounds of the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdga.com/course_directory/course/university-of-montevallo|title=University of Montevallo|first=PDGA|last=Staff|date=2 September 2009|website=pdga.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> At the time of its construction it was one of the few courses located on the campus of a public university in the region.

It was expanded in 1990 to include 75 buildings total.\n\n==History==\n[[File:King House University of Montevallo Montevallo, AL.JPG|thumb|left|Built in the [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in 1823, the King House is the oldest building on campus,<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://dev.montevallo.edu/visitors/TheRedBrickTours/AWalkThroughTime/5-KingHouse.shtm |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-02-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304080440/http://dev.montevallo.edu/visitors/TheRedBrickTours/AWalkThroughTime/5-KingHouse.shtm |archive-date=2016-03-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places in Shelby County, Alabama|National Register of Historic Places]] on January 14, 1972.]]\n\n{{Infobox NRHP\n| name           = Alabama Girls' Industrial School\n| nrhp_type      = hd\n| image          = King Quad.jpg\n| caption        = King Quad at the University of Montevallo<br>University of Montevallo campus\n| location       = Bounded by Middle Campus Dr., Oak, Bloch and Middle Sts., [[Montevallo, Alabama]]\n| locmapin       = Alabama\n| built          = 1851\n| architect      = \n| architecture   = Colonial Revival, Greek Revival, Federal\n| added          = December 11, 1978\n| area           = {{convert|25.7|acre}}\n| governing_body = Local\n| refnum         = 78000509<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2009a}}</ref>\n| nocat          = yes\n}}\nThe main part of the campus was designed by the [[Frederick Law Olmsted|Olmsted brothers]] and the central part is a historic district listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. The university opened in October 1896 as the Alabama Girls' Industrial School (AGIS), a women-only [[technical school]] that also offered [[high school]]-level courses. AGIS became the Alabama Girls' Technical Institute in 1911, further adding \"and College for Women\" in 1919. The school gradually developed as a traditional degree-granting institution, becoming '''Alabama College''', State College for Women in 1923.\n\nThe school effectively became [[coeducation]]al after lobbying by the school's supporters resulted in the [[Alabama Legislature]] passing a bill on January 15, 1956 to remove the designation \"State College for Women\". The first men entered the school that same month. Its student body still maintains a 7:5 ratio of women to men.\n\nIn 1965, the board of trustees authorized President D.P. Culp to sign the Certificates of Assurance of Compliance with the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]].<ref name=ency>[http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1827 Encyclopedia of Alabama: University of Montevallo], accessed 2010-05-16.</ref> In the fall of 1968, three African American women, Carolyn Burpo, Ruby Kennbrew and Dorothy (Lilly) Turner, enrolled in the university.<ref name=ency/> On September 1, 1969, Alabama College was renamed the University of Montevallo.\n\nThe [[Alabama Girls' Industrial School]] was listed on the National Register in 1978. In 1990, the [[University of Montevallo Historic District]] was listed on the National Register, as an expansion.\n\nMontevallo is in the geographic center of [[Alabama]] in an area rich with [[American Civil War|Civil War]] history. Many of the buildings on campus predate the founding of the college, including King House (reserved for special guests of the campus) and Reynolds Hall (used by the Theater Department and alumni relations). King House was reportedly the first home in Alabama to receive pane glass windows. With nearly 3,000 students, the university has a significant economic impact on the surrounding communities in [[Shelby County, Alabama|Shelby County]].\n\n==Traditions==\n\n=== College Night ===\nThe University of Montevallo's [[homecoming]] tradition is called College Night, a coeducational competition in which students may participate for either the Purple Side or the Gold Side, named after the school's colors. The tradition of College Night began as a celebration of the upcoming renaming of Alabama Girls' Technical Institute to Alabama College. First taking place on March 3, 1919, as a competition between the four classes, the Class of 1919 said that \"now that our school is becoming a college, we have begun to take up college stunts.\"<ref>https://archive.org/details/technala121919unse/page/n31/mode/2up</ref>\n\nThe competition consists of various athletic events, including men's and women's [[basketball]], women's [[volleyball]], and men's [[ultimate frisbee]]. During halftime at the men's basketball game, a cheer competition between the Purple Side and the Gold Side takes place. Both sides craft a sign which is displayed in front of Farmer Hall, the campus's [[student union building]]. The main event of College Night is the series of [[musical theater]] productions, all directed, performed, and produced by student participants. The productions last from Wednesday through Saturday on the week of College Night. It is after the final production on Saturday night when either a Purple Victory or a Gold Victory is declared until the next year's College Night. The victor of College Night is decided based on a system of points derived from each side's degree of sportsmanship, how well they perform in the various events, and how the judges of the student-led productions rate each side's show.\n\nIn honor of A.G.T.I.'s 25th anniversary in 1921, College Night became a competition between two sides, Purple and Gold, instead of a competition between the classes.<ref>Jefferson Walker, ''College Night: A Centennial Celebration'' (Montevallo, AL: University of Montevallo, 2019), 5.</ref> Since then, both sides have adopted mascots; Purple Side adopted the cow as theirs, and Gold Side adopted the lion as theirs. Each side has a song that is sung only when members of the side join hands, forming a circle; whereas Purple Side's circle is connected 360\u00b0 around, Gold Side leaves a small whole in their circle. When \"circled up,\" the leaders of each side \"ask a question\" to all the other members of their respective sides. Purple Side's leaders ask, \"Why is their ''never'' a whole in our circle?\" Their side always responds with, \"Because! A united circle is a united side! Let the circle be unbroken!\" Gold Side's leaders ask their side, \"Why is there ''always'' a whole in our circle?\" Their side responds by saying, \"Because! There's always room for one more Gold!\"\n\nIn 2000, College Night was declared a \"Local Legacy\" by the [[Library of Congress]], with an exhibit containing audio recordings of Purple and Gold side songs, photographs, College Night programs, and other artifacts.<ref>Ibid., 190.</ref>\n\n===Crook Week/Senior March===\n[[File:Main Hall, University of Montevallo.JPG|thumb|left|Main Hall, University of Montevallo]]\nTraditionally, Crook Week was a week in late October when the senior class women would hide the \"crook\"\u2014a staff shaped roughly like a [[shepherd]]'s [[crosier|crook]]\u2014and give obscure clues for the underclass women who were to find it.\n\nAt the end of Crook Week was Senior March. When the chimes struck thirteen, if the underclass women did not find the crook, the seniors march on them, getting them out of their rooms and onto Main Quad where they would have a shaving cream and water balloon battle. If the underclass women found the crook, they were safe that year. This tradition ended in the 1990s because the administration considered it hazing.\n\nToday, the Hiding of the Crook occurs the week of Founders' Day. The administration hides the crook and leaves clues as to where it can be found. The finder of the crook gets recognized at Founders' Day with a small prize.\n\n=== Life Raft Debate ===\nThe Life Raft Debate is an annual event sponsored by the Philosophy Club. The debate has occurred each fall semester since 1998, on the second Thursday in October during the university's Founders' Day commemoration.\n\nIn the Life Raft Debate, the audience is asked to imagine that there has been a nuclear war and that they, as the survivors, are setting sail to rebuild society from the ground up. There are a group of professors vying to win the coveted Oar and get on the raft, and only one seat is left. Each professor has to argue that his or her discipline is the one indispensable area of study that the new civilization will need to flourish.\n[[File:Varagona with oar.jpg|thumb|Scott Varagona with the oar]]\n\nEach professor gets to give an introductory account of his or her discipline then a brief rebuttal to the others. At the end of the debate, the audience votes and the lucky winner claims the Oar and climbs aboard, waving goodbye to the others. Often, a seventh participant, the Devil's Advocate, appears and tries to convince the audience that the entire panel is unworthy and that all should be left behind to drown. In the following year, the defending champion faces five new challengers in a new debate. To date, no one has successfully defended the Oar.\n\nThe first event was held in 1998 before an audience of roughly 200 people. Michael Sterner of the Mathematics Department carried the day with an impassioned defense of his discipline, touting both its usefulness and beauty and promising that, if he were to be saved, there would be \"no more word problems ever.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liferaftdebate.com/|title=University of Montevallo's Life Raft Debate Home Page|author=|date=|website=www.liferaftdebate.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> In the subsequent years the debate's popularity grew to attract more than 800 audience members per year. Following years saw victories by professors from a variety of academic disciplines.\n\nOn March 12, 2010, the public radio show ''[[This American Life]]'' ran a story on the Life Raft Debate entitled \"I'd Like to Spank the Academy.\"<ref>[http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/402/save-the-day episode 402, ''Save the Day'']</ref> The story followed the events of the 2007 Life Raft Debate in which the Devil's Advocate, Jon Smith, a professor in the the Department of English, successfully argued that all the panelists should be drowned because they were merely trying to be funny, not to educate or to defend the importance of their respective disciplines. Following the broadcast, several colleges and universities in the United States and abroad began hosting Life Raft Debates of their own.\n\n==Campus resources==\n===James Wylie Shepherd Observatory===\nThe James Wylie Shepherd Observatory at the University of Montevallo was opened in the Fall of 2009. The observatory was built on the site of a former construction landfill, now remade into Gentry Springs field.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shelbycountyreporter.com/2011/05/26/voting-for-the-stars/ |title=Voting for the stars |last=Hurst |first=Katie |date=26 May 2011 |publisher=[[Shelby County Reporter]] |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref> The observatory is a U of M sustainability landmark.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mygreenbirmingham.com/2011/10/montevallo-introduces-a-new-bike-share-program/ |title=Montevallo introduces a new bike share program |date=19 October 2011 |publisher=MyGreenBirmingham.com |accessdate=23 January 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[File:The James Wylie Shepherd Observatory.jpg|thumb|left|The James Wylie Shepherd Observatory is located roughly three miles from the university campus.]]\n\nThe observatory is located roughly three miles from the main campus on the 150-acre Gentry Springs site owned by the university. The JWSO is capable of astronomical telescopic observation and astrophotography, has a dedicated telescope for solar viewing, and is one of very few observatories in the country that is designed specifically to be completely accessible to people of all disabilities.\n\nBesides its observing capabilities, the JWSO will be a [[Green building|green facility]], employing self-composting toilets, filtered rainwater and solar-generated electricity. The facility is currently used by UM classes, the Montevallo Astronomical Society, AMSTI partners and a variety of area K-12 classes and other local groups. There are also regularly-scheduled public viewing nights that are free of charge.\n\nUpon completion, the observing complex will house an outdoor planetarium/amphitheater, a docent's cabin, walking trails, a digital indoor planetarium, a visiting scholar's dormitory, educational exhibits and a visitors' center in which groups can see images generated by the main telescope.  Additional smaller scopes for solar and planetary observing can be set up at various locations outside the main dome, which is surrounded by solar-powered outdoor low-level lighting.\n\n===Ebenezer Swamp Ecological Preserve===\n[[File:Ebenezer Swamp Boardwalk.jpg|thumb|The Ebenezer Swamp Ecological Preserve is located in Shelby County, Alabama. It is maintained by The University of Montevallo for teaching and research.]]\n\nThe University of Montevallo's Ebenezer Swamp consists of approximately {{convert|60|acre|m2}} of wooded wetlands and is located on near the headwaters of Spring Creek, approximately {{convert|6|mi|km}} northeast of the University in central Alabama.\n\nSpring Creek and Ebenezer Swamp form a portion of the headwaters for the ecologically diverse and environmentally sensitive [[Cahaba River]] Watershed. The Cahaba is the longest remaining free-flowing river, has more species of fish per mile than any river in North America and is one of eight river biodiversity hotspots in the U.S.\n\nUM is creating the Ebenezer Swamp Wetlands Interpretive and Research Center (ESWIRC) to focus greater research on wetland ecology and to increase educational opportunities for high school and middle school students from across the state of Alabama.  Research goals center on: establishing and maintaining an inventory of plant, animal and fungal species; monitoring water quality, rainfall and stream flow rates; and future studies of wetland ecological processes and the effects of encroachment along the swamp margin.  Education goals center on raising the profile of the ecologic importance of wetlands to high school and middle school students, while simultaneously providing them with a sound introduction to the underlying principles of biology.\n\n===ValloCycle: Montevallo Bike-Share Program===\nFormed through a collaborative partnership between the City of [[Montevallo]] and the University of Montevallo, the [[ValloCycle Bike-Share Program]] exists as a citywide initiative to enhance overall community walkability and individual citizen engagement with a lifestyle of sustainable, alternative transportation. The ValloCycle Bike-Share Program's primary means of achieving these goals is through its day-to-day operation of the [[ValloCycle Bike-Share Program]], the first county-wide bicycle sharing program in the state of Alabama to offer low-cost bicycle rentals to all the members of its community.\n\nUnlike other nearby campus bike-share programs, ValloCycle bicycle rentals are not limited solely to university students and are also not confined to one location. Rather, bicycle rentals are offered to all residents of Montevallo and the surrounding Shelby County area in three separate check-out locations. Annual membership fees amount to roughly $2 a month for adults and $1 a month per child.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505245_162-57349669/green-group-tornado-cleanup-a-bright-spot-for-ala/|title=Green Group Tornado Cleanup A Bright Spot For Alabama |date=29 December 2011 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2012/01/birmingham_bike-share_program.html|title=Birmingham Bike Share Program Pedals Into Downtown Life |last=Spencer |first=Tom |date= 2 January 2012 |newspaper=[[Birmingham News]] |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe all-volunteer ValloCycle Board oversees the implementation of a number of other campus and community programs, events, resources and public bicyclist/pedestrian infrastructure enhancements, including the Montevallo \"Share the Lane\" Initiative,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://weldbham.com/local/2011/12/16/sharing-the-lanes-new-biking-infrastructure-in-montevallo/ |title=Sharing the lanes: New biking infrastructure in Montevallo |last=Chambers |first= Jesse |date= 16 December 2011 |publisher=[[WELD For Birmingham]] |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> the ValloCycle Town Map Project,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mygreenbirmingham.com/2012/02/vallocycle-creates-town-map-showcases-local-businesses-sustainablity/ |title=Vallocycle Creates Town Map, Showcases Local Businesses & Sustainability |last=Agliata |first=Kate |date=1 February 2012 |publisher=My Green Birmingham |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> and the Montevallo \"Tour By Bike\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://southshelby.myfoxal.com/news/environment/97695-um-celebrates-sustainability-115th-founders-day |title=UM celebrates sustainability at 115th Founder's Day |last=Sides |first=Melinda |date=13 October 2011 |publisher=Fox 6 WBRC |accessdate=28 February 2012}}</ref> Membership forms are available at ValloCycle's public website, vallocycle.com.\n\n===Greek life===\n\n====Interfraternity Council====\n* [[Alpha Kappa Lambda]] (Gamma Delta, 1995)\n* [[Alpha Tau Omega]] (Eta Omega, 1972)\n* [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] (Sigma-Epsilon, 1972)\n* [[Phi Gamma Delta]] (Mu Phi, 2014)\n\n====Panhellenic Council====\n* [[Alpha Delta Pi]] (Zeta Delta, 1971)\n* [[Alpha Gamma Delta]] (Gamma Upsilon, 1972)\n* [[Chi Omega]] (Tau Kappa, 1971)\n* [[Delta Gamma]] (Zeta Nu, 1991)\n* [[Phi Mu]] (Kappa Chi, 1972)\n\n====National Pan-Hellenic Council====\n* [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] (Mu Mu, 1978)\n* [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] (Nu Tau, 1978)\n* [[Delta Sigma Theta]] (Nu Omicron, 1977)\n* [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] (Xi Upsilon, 1995)\n* [[Zeta Phi Beta]] (Tau Pi, 1998)\n\n====Professional fraternity====\n* [[Phi Chi Theta]] (Gamma Tau, 1973)\n\n===Disc golf course===\nIn 2007, The University of Montevallo in cooperation with the Professional Disc Golf Association built a full size, 18 hole, disc golf course on the grounds of the campus.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pdga.com/course_directory/course/university-of-montevallo|title=University of Montevallo|first=PDGA|last=Staff|date=2 September 2009|website=pdga.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}</ref> At the time of its construction it was one of the few courses located on the campus of a public university in the region.

He began performing in the late 1950s as a [[teen idol]], switching to [[country music]] in the early 1960s.\n\n==Biography==\nHamilton was born in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]], on July 19, 1937. While a 19-year-old student at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], Hamilton recorded \"[[A Rose and a Baby Ruth]]\" for a [[Chapel Hill, North Carolina|Chapel Hill]] record label, [[Colonial Records]]. The song, written by [[John D. Loudermilk]], climbed to No. 6 on the United States [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] [[record chart|chart]]. By 1960, \"A Rose and a Baby Ruth\" had attained [[music recording sales certification|gold record]] status for [[ABC Records|ABC-Paramount]] (which had acquired the song from [[Colonial Records|Colonial]]).<ref name=\"The Book of Golden Discs\">{{cite book\n| first= Joseph\n| last= Murrells\n| year= 1978\n| title= The Book of Golden Discs\n| edition= 2nd\n| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd\n| location= London\n| page= [https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/82 82]\n| isbn= 0-214-20512-6\n| url-access= registration\n| url= https://archive.org/details/bookofgoldendisc00murr/page/82\n}}</ref> The self-penned [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of the record, \"If You Don't Know\", revealed Hamilton's ambitions to be a [[rockabilly]]-country singer.\n\nAfter his big hit, George was invited to Washington, DC to become a member of the cast of the Jimmy Dean Show where he performed regularly with Patsy   \nCline and Jimmy Dean.

That particular season was an unhappy one for Tipp.  A new manager in 2008 brought a change of fortune as Maher collected a National League title in 2008.\n\nOn 5 September 2010, Maher was a non-playing substitute as Tipperary won their 26th [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All Ireland title]], beating reigning champions [[Kilkenny GAA|Killkenny]] by 4-17 to 1-18 in the [[2010 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|final]], preventing Kilkenny from achieving an historic 5-in-a-row; it was Maher's first All-Ireland winners medal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/hurling/rampant-tipp-deny-cats-immortality-2326052.html|title=Rampant Tipp deny Cats immortality|date=2010-09-06|work=Irish Independent|accessdate=2010-09-08}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080921172419/http://tipperary.gaa.ie/seniorhurlingplayerprofiles.html Tipperary Player Profiles]\n\n==Teams==\n\n{{Tipperary Intermediate Hurling Team 2002}}\n{{Tipperary Hurling Team 2008}}\n{{Tipperary Hurling Team 2009}}\n{{Tipperary Hurling Team 2010}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Maher, Shane}}\n[[Category:1981 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Burgess hurlers]]\n[[Category:Tipperary inter-county hurlers]]\n[[Category:Tipperary inter-county Gaelic footballers]]\n[[Category:Burgess Gaelic footballers]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox GAA player\n| code = Hurling\n| sport = Hurling\n| image = \n| name = Shane Maher\n| irish = Se\u00e1n \u00d3 Meagher\n| fullname = Shane Maher\n| feet = 6\n| inches = 0\n| occupation = Stryker Limerick Employee\n| nickname = \n| county = Tipperary\n| province = Munster\n| club = [[Burgess GAA|Burgess]]\n| clposition = Half-back\n| clubs = \n| clyears = \n| clapps(points) = \n| clcounty = \n| clprovince = \n| clallireland = \n| counties = Tipperary (H)<br/>Tipperary (F)\n| icposition = Half-back\n| icyears = 2003-2007\n| icapps(points) = 6 (0-1)<br/>4\n| icprovince = 2\n| icallireland = 1\n| nhl = 1\n| clupdate = \n| icupdate = \n| birth_date = {{Birth date and age|1981|4|22|df=yes}}\n| birth_place = [[Gortmore, Carrigatoher, County Tipperary|Gortmore]], [[County Tipperary]]\n}} \n'''Shane Maher''' (born 22 April 1981 in [[Gortmore, County Tipperary|Gortmore]], [[County Tipperary]]) is an [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]] sportsperson.
