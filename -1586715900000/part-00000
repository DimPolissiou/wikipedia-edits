Prior to the introduction of the F/A-18F, they were known as Radar Intercept Officers (RIO) in the aft seats of the [[F-4 Phantom II]] and [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14 Tomcat]]; as Bombardier/Navigators (B/N) in the right seat of the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6 Intruder]] and the [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3 Skywarrior]] and in the aft seat in the [[North American A-5 Vigilante|A-5 Vigilante]]; and Reconnaissance Attack Navigators (RAN) in the aft seat of the [[A-5 Vigilante|RA-5C Vigilante]].\n\nIn the [[United States Marine Corps]], \"WSO\" refers to [[naval flight officer]]s serving as the aft crew member of the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18D Hornet]].  Prior to the introduction of the F/A-18D, they also served as Radar Intercept Officers (RIO) in the aft seat of the [[F-4 Phantom II]], Reconnaissance Systems Officers (RSO) in the aft seat of reconnaissance aircraft such as the [[F-4 Phantom II|RF-4B Phantom II]] and as Bombardier/Navigators (B/N) in the right seat of the A-6 Intruder. Until mid-2019, the Marines also employed Naval Flight Officers in the [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler|EA-6B Prowler]], where they were known as Electronic Countermeasures Officers (ECMO, pronounced \u201cEK-mo\u201d).\n\nIn U.S. Naval Aviation ([[USN]] & [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]), when designated as the mission commander (MC), the WSO is responsible for all phases of the assigned mission, especially if there are multiple aircraft involved.  For example, the aircraft pilot could be the junior member of a flight crew such as a USN lieutenant, junior grade/USMC 1st lieutenant or USN lieutenant/USMC captain, and the weapon systems officer could be a senior officer such as a USN lieutenant commander, commander or captain, or a USMC major, lieutenant colonel, or colonel; this would likely make the WSO the mission commander.\n\n====U.S. Air Force====\nIn the [[U.S. Air Force]], \"WSO\" also refers to a USAF [[combat systems officer]] (CSO, formerly USAF navigator) who is the aft crew member in the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E Strike Eagle]]. In the B-52, the CSO crew members on the lower deck of the aircraft who were previously designated as navigator and radar navigator (bombardier) are now known as weapon systems officers while the CSO on the upper deck is an electronic warfare officer. In the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]] bomber, there are 2 weapon systems officers manning crew positions aft of the pilot and co-pilot. They are known as the Offensive Systems Officer (OSO), and the Defensive Systems Officer (DSO).  WSOs also flew in the now-retired [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]] Aardvark strike bomber, flown by the [[US Air Force]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and the now retired USAF [[General Dynamics\u2013Grumman EF-111A Raven|EF-111A]] Raven airborne jammer. In the F-111, the WSO (EWO in the EF-111) was seated directly to the right of the pilot/aircraft commander. The WSO integrates with the [[Aviator|pilot]] to collectively achieve and maintain crew efficiency, situational awareness and mission effectiveness. In the U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft such as the F-15E Strike Eagle, the WSO can pilot the aircraft when required, although this is typically during non-tactical portions of the mission (e.g., en route to mission area or returning to base). When designated as the mission commander (MC), the WSO is also responsible for all phases of the assigned mission, especially if there are multiple aircraft involved.  For example, the aircraft pilot could be the junior member of a flight crew such as a first lieutenant or captain, and the weapon systems officer could be a senior officer such as a major, lieutenant colonel, or colonel; regardless of rank, the WSO would be the mission commander if he/she is qualified.\n\n===Training===\nCurrently, all USN WSOs begin their training as student naval flight officers (SNFO) at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]]. Training begins with Introductory Flight Screening, where the WSO flies a [[Cessna 172]] or [[Piper PA-28]] variant to show he/she is competent enough in aviation to continue the rigorous training ahead.  Then the SNFO starts the U.S. Navy indoctrination course called Aviation Preflight Indoctrination (API) with his/her student [[naval aviator]] (pilot) counterparts.  After six weeks of ground school and basic water survival training during API, future SWSOs (Student WSOs), at that point known as student naval flight officers (SNFO) check into the primary Training Squadron for SNFOs, the [[VT-10]] Wildcats.\n\n====Primary====\nTraining begins with several weeks of ground school followed by remnants of the \"super-fo\" program from the U.S. Navy where the SNFO takes front seat of the new [[Beechcraft T-6 Texan II|T-6 Texan II]] for six \"contact\" flights where the student will become familiar with the T-6. The SNFO is treated like a pilot training student for these six flights. After Contacts, the SNFO goes back to academics to learn [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flying rules]]. Primary ends with a final instrument checkride. After primary the SNFO is compared to his or her shipmates and selected for either land-based naval aircraft or tailhook aircraft. Those SNFOs destined for the carrier-based [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C or E-2D Hawkeye]] will be known as air control officers and combat information center officers, while those destined for the EA-18G Growler (USN only) will be electronic warfare officers (EWO). Those destined for the F/A-18F Super Hornet (USN Only) or the F/A-18D Hornet (USMC only) will become WSOs.\n\n====Intermediate====\nIntermediate picks up where Primary ends for USAF SWSOs. After the instrument phase of training, students move to visual navigation (VNAV) \"low levels\" at 2000'AGL, and finish in the T-6 with a final training block called \"forms\" (formation flying). Forms consist of four flights of learning the basics of close in formation flying. After forms, SWSOs head back to ground school to learn an entirely new aircraft, the USN [[North American Sabreliner|T-39 Sabreliner]]. The T-39 is used as an intermediate instrument and low-level trainer for SWSOs, where they receive a total of eight flights. Students are required to learn the aircraft in a two-week ground school period before they go flight side. In contrast, T-6 ground school is four weeks. Training ends at either VT-10 or VT-4 with the \"i-grad\" ceremony and top graduate award.\n\n====Advanced====\nVT-86 is where all the training comes together to culminate in the SWSO receiving his or her wings of gold. In the T-39, a USN twin-engine jet trainer, SWSOs learn advanced instrument flying, radar navigation (consisting of navigating using an A/G radar from early F-16s), and composite visual/radar navigation. Training takes place on both VR and IR routes that criss-cross the south east United States. After A/G training, track selection takes place. Navy SWSOs select either the F/A-18F Super Hornet, or the E/A-18 Growler. Marine SWSOs by default select the F/A-18D Hornet. The final three months of some of the hardest training at Pensacola will leave the SWSO F/A-18 selectee with their wings of gold. Air Force WSOs no longer train at VT-86.\n\n====Graduate training====\nFollowing the winging ceremony, USN and USMC WSOs will proceed to a Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) and USAF WSOs to a Formal Training Unit (FTU) to complete advanced ground school and flight training to prepare them for their \"operational\" combat aircraft in the deployable operating forces.\n\n'''Parachuting water survival'''<br />\nAll USAF aviators with parachutes on the aircraft attend this three-day course at NAS Pensacola, Florida. During the course, USAF WSOs learn the basics of surviving an aircraft ejection over water, obtaining food and drinkable water when stranded at sea, combat evasion at sea, and how to be successfully rescued by boat or helicopter. For USN and USMC WSOs, this program was previously completed at NAS Pensacola during their Aviation Preflight Indoctrination (API) training.\n\n'''Centrifuge training'''<br />\nThis one-day course located at [[Brooks City-Base]], San Antonio, Texas, tests USAF WSOs selected for the F-15E in their ability to withstand the [[g-force]]s routinely experienced by fighter aircrew.\n\n'''SERE'''<br />\nThe [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) training course trains all USAF aircrew basic survival skills, combat evasion, and techniques to resist exploitation if captured. WSOs also learn how to survive an aircraft ejection over land. For USAF personnel, the three-week course is taught at [[Fairchild Air Force Base]], Washington and the surrounding areas. The counterpart course for USN and USMC WSOs is taught at [[NAS North Island]] (academics) and [[Warner Springs, California]] (field exercise) for Pacific Fleet personnel and at Brunswick, Maine for Atlantic Fleet personnel.\n\n'''IFF'''<br />\nUSAF WSOs selected for the F-15E learn [[basic fighter maneuvers]] (BFM) and surface attack in the [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38C]] at '''Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals''' (IFF). WSOs complete this training at either the [[435th Fighter Training Squadron]] at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], Texas or the [[49th Fighter Training Squadron]] at [[Columbus Air Force Base]], Mississippi. WSOs also learn about the culture of being a young aircrew member in a USAF fighter squadron. The course lasts approximately eight weeks.\n\n'''EWO'''<br />\nUSAF WSOs selected for the B-1B, [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]], and some F-15E selectees will become [[electronic warfare officer]]s (EWOs) by attending this 12-week training program at the [[563d Flying Training Squadron]] at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. A similar program for USN EWOs in the EA-18G and USMC ECMOs in the EA-6B is conducted at the '''Center for Information Dominance''' at [[Corry Station]], Florida. In both programs, students learn the basics of radar theory, electronic attack, and electronic defense.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|Aviation}}\n\n* [[Aircrew]] (Flight crew)\n* [[Combat Systems Officer]]\n* [[Naval Flight Officer]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104500/b-1b-lancer/ Factsheet B-1B Lancer]\n*[https://www.boeing.com/defense/b-1b-bomber/ Factsheet B-1B Lancer, Boeing]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802043924/http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=102 Factsheet F-15E Strike Eagle]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070328164103/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/fa18/index.htm F/A-18 C/D Fact Sheet]\n\n[[Category:Military aviation occupations]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force specialisms]]\n[[Category:United States Navy job titles]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=September 2014}}\n{{globalize|date=September 2014}}\n}}\n\n[[File:F-15E cockpit view from tanker.jpg|thumb|F-15E cockpit view from tanker; pilot and WSO visible]]\nA '''Weapon Systems Officer''' ('''WSO''', or '''wizzo''' as a common nickname ) is an air flight officer directly involved in all air operations and [[List of aircraft weapons|weapon systems]] of a military aircraft.\n\nHistorically, aircrew duties in military aircraft were highly specialised and rigid, because the relevant controls, instruments/displays, and/or weapons were concentrated in front of particular seats, panels or positions.

Prior to the introduction of the F/A-18F, they were known as Radar Intercept Officers (RIO) in the aft seats of the [[F-4 Phantom II]] and [[Grumman F-14 Tomcat|F-14 Tomcat]]; as Bombardier/Navigators (B/N) in the right seat of the [[Grumman A-6 Intruder|A-6 Intruder]] and the [[Douglas A-3 Skywarrior|A-3 Skywarrior]] and in the aft seat in the [[North American A-5 Vigilante|A-5 Vigilante]]; and Reconnaissance Attack Navigators (RAN) in the aft seat of the [[A-5 Vigilante|RA-5C Vigilante]].\n\nIn the [[United States Marine Corps]], \"WSO\" refers to [[naval flight officer]]s serving as the aft crew member of the [[McDonnell Douglas F/A-18 Hornet|F/A-18D Hornet]].  Prior to the introduction of the F/A-18D, they also served as Radar Intercept Officers (RIO) in the aft seat of the [[F-4 Phantom II]], Reconnaissance Systems Officers (RSO) in the aft seat of reconnaissance aircraft such as the [[F-4 Phantom II|RF-4B Phantom II]] and as Bombardier/Navigators (B/N) in the right seat of the A-6 Intruder. Until mid-2019, the Marines also employed Naval Flight Officers in the [[Northrop Grumman EA-6B Prowler|EA-6B Prowler]], where they were known as Electronic Countermeasures Officers (ECMO, pronounced \u201cEK-mo\u201d).\n\nIn U.S. Naval Aviation ([[USN]] & [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]]), when designated as the mission commander (MC), the WSO is responsible for all phases of the assigned mission, especially if there are multiple aircraft involved.  For example, the aircraft pilot could be the junior member of a flight crew such as a USN lieutenant, junior grade/USMC 1st lieutenant or USN lieutenant/USMC captain, and the weapon systems officer could be a senior officer such as a USN lieutenant commander, commander or captain, or a USMC major, lieutenant colonel, or colonel; this would likely make the WSO the mission commander.\n\n====U.S. Air Force====\nIn the [[U.S. Air Force]], \"WSO\" also refers to a USAF [[combat systems officer]] (CSO, formerly USAF navigator) who is the aft crew member in the [[McDonnell Douglas F-15E Strike Eagle|F-15E Strike Eagle]]. In the B-52, the CSO crew members on the lower deck of the aircraft who were previously designated as navigator and radar navigator (bombardier) are now known as weapon systems officers while the CSO on the upper deck is an electronic warfare officer. In the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B Lancer]] bomber, there are 2 weapon systems officers manning crew positions aft of the pilot and co-pilot. They are known as the Offensive Systems Officer (OSO), and the Defensive Systems Officer (DSO).  WSOs also flew in the now-retired [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark|F-111]] Aardvark strike bomber, flown by the [[US Air Force]] and [[Royal Australian Air Force]], and the now retired USAF [[General Dynamics\u2013Grumman EF-111A Raven|EF-111A]] Raven airborne jammer. In the F-111, the WSO (EWO in the EF-111) was seated directly to the right of the pilot/aircraft commander. The WSO integrates with the [[Aviator|pilot]] to collectively achieve and maintain crew efficiency, situational awareness and mission effectiveness. In the U.S. Air Force fighter aircraft such as the F-15E Strike Eagle, the WSO can pilot the aircraft when required, although this is typically during non-tactical portions of the mission (e.g., en route to mission area or returning to base). When designated as the mission commander (MC), the WSO is also responsible for all phases of the assigned mission, especially if there are multiple aircraft involved.  For example, the aircraft pilot could be the junior member of a flight crew such as a first lieutenant or captain, and the weapon systems officer could be a senior officer such as a major, lieutenant colonel, or colonel; regardless of rank, the WSO would be the mission commander if he/she is qualified.\n\n===Training===\nCurrently, all USN WSOs begin their training as student naval flight officers (SNFO) at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola|NAS Pensacola]], [[Florida]]. Training begins with Introductory Flight Screening, where the WSO flies a [[Cessna 172]] or [[Piper PA-28]] variant to show he/she is competent enough in aviation to continue the rigorous training ahead.  Then the SNFO starts the U.S. Navy indoctrination course called Aviation Preflight Indoctrination (API) with his/her student [[naval aviator]] (pilot) counterparts.  After six weeks of ground school and basic water survival training during API, future SWSOs (Student WSOs), at that point known as student naval flight officers (SNFO) check into the primary Training Squadron for SNFOs, the [[VT-10]] Wildcats.\n\n====Primary====\nTraining begins with several weeks of ground school followed by remnants of the \"super-fo\" program from the U.S. Navy where the SNFO takes front seat of the new [[Beechcraft T-6 Texan II|T-6 Texan II]] for six \"contact\" flights where the student will become familiar with the T-6. The SNFO is treated like a pilot training student for these six flights. After Contacts, the SNFO goes back to academics to learn [[Instrument flight rules|instrument flying rules]]. Primary ends with a final instrument checkride. After primary the SNFO is compared to his or her shipmates and selected for either land-based naval aircraft or tailhook aircraft. Those SNFOs destined for the carrier-based [[Northrop Grumman E-2 Hawkeye|E-2C or E-2D Hawkeye]] will be known as air control officers and combat information center officers, while those destined for the EA-18G Growler (USN only) will be electronic warfare officers (EWO). Those destined for the F/A-18F Super Hornet (USN Only) or the F/A-18D Hornet (USMC only) will become WSOs.\n\n====Intermediate====\nIntermediate picks up where Primary ends for USAF SWSOs. After the instrument phase of training, students move to visual navigation (VNAV) \"low levels\" at 2000'AGL, and finish in the T-6 with a final training block called \"forms\" (formation flying). Forms consist of four flights of learning the basics of close in formation flying. After forms, SWSOs head back to ground school to learn an entirely new aircraft, the USN [[North American Sabreliner|T-39 Sabreliner]]. The T-39 is used as an intermediate instrument and low-level trainer for SWSOs, where they receive a total of eight flights. Students are required to learn the aircraft in a two-week ground school period before they go flight side. In contrast, T-6 ground school is four weeks. Training ends at either VT-10 or VT-4 with the \"i-grad\" ceremony and top graduate award.\n\n====Advanced====\nVT-86 is where all the training comes together to culminate in the SWSO receiving his or her wings of gold. In the T-39, a USN twin-engine jet trainer, SWSOs learn advanced instrument flying, radar navigation (consisting of navigating using an A/G radar from early F-16s), and composite visual/radar navigation. Training takes place on both VR and IR routes that criss-cross the south east United States. After A/G training, track selection takes place. Navy SWSOs select either the F/A-18F Super Hornet, or the E/A-18 Growler. Marine SWSOs by default select the F/A-18D Hornet. The final three months of some of the hardest training at Pensacola will leave the SWSO F/A-18 selectee with their wings of gold. Air Force WSOs no longer train at VT-86.\n\n====Graduate training====\nFollowing the winging ceremony, USN and USMC WSOs will proceed to a Fleet Replacement Squadron (FRS) and USAF WSOs to a Formal Training Unit (FTU) to complete advanced ground school and flight training to prepare them for their \"operational\" combat aircraft in the deployable operating forces.\n\n'''Parachuting water survival'''<br />\nAll USAF aviators with parachutes on the aircraft attend this three-day course at NAS Pensacola, Florida. During the course, USAF WSOs learn the basics of surviving an aircraft ejection over water, obtaining food and drinkable water when stranded at sea, combat evasion at sea, and how to be successfully rescued by boat or helicopter. For USN and USMC WSOs, this program was previously completed at NAS Pensacola during their Aviation Preflight Indoctrination (API) training.\n\n'''Centrifuge training'''<br />\nThis one-day course located at [[Brooks City-Base]], San Antonio, Texas, tests USAF WSOs selected for the F-15E in their ability to withstand the [[g-force]]s routinely experienced by fighter aircrew.\n\n'''SERE'''<br />\nThe [[Survival, Evasion, Resistance and Escape]] (SERE) training course trains all USAF aircrew basic survival skills, combat evasion, and techniques to resist exploitation if captured. WSOs also learn how to survive an aircraft ejection over land. For USAF personnel, the three-week course is taught at [[Fairchild Air Force Base]], Washington and the surrounding areas. The counterpart course for USN and USMC WSOs is taught at [[NAS North Island]] (academics) and [[Warner Springs, California]] (field exercise) for Pacific Fleet personnel and at Brunswick, Maine for Atlantic Fleet personnel.\n\n'''IFF'''<br />\nUSAF WSOs selected for the F-15E learn [[basic fighter maneuvers]] (BFM) and surface attack in the [[Northrop T-38 Talon|T-38C]] at '''Introduction to Fighter Fundamentals''' (IFF). WSOs complete this training at either the [[435th Fighter Training Squadron]] at [[Randolph Air Force Base]], Texas or the [[49th Fighter Training Squadron]] at [[Columbus Air Force Base]], Mississippi. WSOs also learn about the culture of being a young aircrew member in a USAF fighter squadron. The course lasts approximately eight weeks.\n\n'''EWO'''<br />\nUSAF WSOs selected for the B-1B, [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]], and some F-15E selectees will become [[electronic warfare officer]]s (EWOs) by attending this 12-week training program at the [[563d Flying Training Squadron]] at Randolph Air Force Base, Texas. A similar program for USN EWOs in the EA-18G and USMC ECMOs in the EA-6B is conducted at the '''Center for Information Dominance''' at [[Corry Station]], Florida. In both programs, students learn the basics of radar theory, electronic attack, and electronic defense.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Wikipedia books|Aviation}}\n\n* [[Aircrew]] (Flight crew)\n* [[Combat Systems Officer]]\n* [[Naval Flight Officer]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*[http://www.af.mil/About-Us/Fact-Sheets/Display/Article/104500/b-1b-lancer/ Factsheet B-1B Lancer]\n*[https://www.boeing.com/defense/b-1b-bomber/ Factsheet B-1B Lancer, Boeing]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20030802043924/http://www.af.mil/factsheets/factsheet.asp?fsID=102 Factsheet F-15E Strike Eagle]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070328164103/http://www.boeing.com/defense-space/military/fa18/index.htm F/A-18 C/D Fact Sheet]\n\n[[Category:Military aviation occupations]]\n[[Category:United States Air Force specialisms]]\n[[Category:United States Navy job titles]]\n", "name_user": "The Beanster", "label": "safe", "comment": "Added wikilinks for previous contribution and cite for WSO", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_systems_officer"}

On 31 December Wuhan CDC admitted that there was a cluster of unknown pneumonia cases related to [[Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market|Huanan Seafood Market]] after the unverified documents appeared on the Internet. The potential disease outbreak soon drew nationwide attention including that of the [[National Health Commission]] (NHC) in Beijing who sent experts to Wuhan on the following day.
