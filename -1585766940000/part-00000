It was Portsmouth's second consecutive season in English football's top-flight.\n\n==Season summary==\nPortsmouth's campaign got off to a good start, winning four of their first ten games including the famous, brilliant 2\u20130 win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as they maintained a strong mid-table position in late October. However, manager [[Harry Redknapp]] walked out on Portsmouth in November after a row with chairman [[Milan Mandaric]] over the appointment of new Director of Football [[Velimir Zajec]] at the club. Zajec replaced Redknapp as manager with immediate effect, but under his management the club's form dipped, bringing the club from the top ten to a few points above the relegation zone. In April, Zajec was replaced by Frenchman [[Alain Perrin]]; Perrin managed to secure Portsmouth's Premiership status with a few games of the season left. Despite this, Portsmouth still played a pivotal role in the \"Survival Sunday\" relegation drama - by losing 2\u20130 at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] they both secured Albion's Premiership status and helped relegate arch-rivals [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] (although Southampton were beaten 2\u20131 at home by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and would have been relegated even if Albion had lost).\n==Final league table==\n{{main|2004\u201305 FA Premier League}}\n{{:2004\u201305 FA Premier League|showteam=POR}}\n\n==Kit==\nPortsmouth retained the previous

Premier League]]. It was Portsmouth's second consecutive season in English football's top-flight.\n\n==Season summary==\nPortsmouth's campaign got off to a good start, winning four of their first ten games including the famous, brilliant 2-0 win over [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] as they maintained a strong mid-table position in late October. However, manager [[Harry Redknapp]] walked out on Portsmouth in November after a row with chairman [[Milan Mandaric]] over the appointment of new Director of Football [[Velimir Zajec]] at the club. Zajec replaced Redknapp as manager with immediate effect, but under his management the club's form dipped, bringing the club from the top ten to a few points above the relegation zone. In April, Zajec was replaced by Frenchman [[Alain Perrin]]; Perrin managed to secure Portsmouth's Premiership status with a few games of the season left. Despite this, Portsmouth still played a pivotal role in the \"Survival Sunday\" relegation drama - by losing 2\u20130 at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] they both secured Albion's Premiership status and helped relegate arch-rivals [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] (although Southampton were beaten 2\u20131 at home by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and would have been relegated even if Albion had lost).\n==Final league table==\n{{main|2004\u201305 FA Premier League}}\n{{:2004\u201305 FA Premier League|showteam=POR}}\n\n==Kit==\nPortsmouth retained the previous

[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] were the defending champions after going [[The Invincibles (football)|unbeaten]] the previous season. [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] won the title with a then record 95 points, which was previously set by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1993-94 FA Premier League|1993-94 season]], and later surpassed by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the [[2017\u201318 Premier League|2017\u201318 season]], securing the title with a 2\u20130 win at the [[Reebok Stadium]] against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C|Bolton Wanderers]]. Chelsea also broke a number of other records during their campaign, most notably breaking the record of most games won in a single Premier League campaign, securing 29 wins in the league in home and away matches.\n\nIn the domestic cup competitions, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] won the [[FA Cup]] after beating holders [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on penalties in the final. [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] won the [[Football League Cup]], beating [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (who had defeated holders [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the 4th round) 3\u20132 after extra time.\n\n==Season summary==\nArsenal were the favourites to defend their title after finishing the [[2003\u201304 Arsenal F.C. season|previous season]] unbeaten, but they also faced competition in the form of regular challengers Manchester United and Chelsea, the latter under the new management of Portuguese [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]], who had just won the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] with [[FC Porto|Porto]]. Liverpool also had a new manager in Spaniard [[Rafael Ben\u00edtez]], who had just won [[La Liga]] and the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] with [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] and were expected to challenge for the title too. Another managerial change at a club aiming for the top was at Tottenham Hotspur, who appointed [[Jacques Santini]], who had just led [[French national football team|France]] to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2004|the 2004 European Championship]].\n\nAt the other end of the table, amongst those tipped for relegation were Norwich City, Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion, having all just been promoted from the First Division (which was rebranded this season as the Championship). Everton, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth were also tipped to struggle, the first three finishing just outside the relegation places the previous season and Portsmouth being in their second season.\n\nFor the first time since the advent of the Premier League in 1992, no team was mathematically relegated before the final day of the season. In each of the last three weekends of the season, the team that was bottom of the table at the start of the weekend finished it outside the drop zone. The final round of the season started on 15 May with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at the bottom, [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] one point ahead and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] a further point ahead, in the last safe spot.\n\nWest Brom, who had been bottom of the table and eight points from safety on Christmas Day, did their part by defeating [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] at home 2\u20130. Norwich, the only side to have their fate completely in their own hands, lost 6\u20130 at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and went down. Southampton lost 2\u20131 at home to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and were relegated after 27 years in the top flight. Palace, away to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], were leading 2\u20131 after 71 minutes, but with eight minutes to go, Charlton's [[Jonathan Fortune]] equalised to relegate Palace. Thus, West Brom stayed up, becoming the first club in Premier League history to avoid relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas.\n\nArsenal's record-breaking unbeaten streak of 49 games was ended on 24 October 2004, when Manchester United beat them 2\u20130 at Old Trafford.\n\nAt the end of the 90 minutes in all four matches, cameras focused on West Brom's home ground, [[The Hawthorns]], as confirmation of other results began to filter through. Once the realisation dawned on the players and fans that survival had been achieved, a mass [[pitch invasion]] was sparked, with huge celebrations. The Portsmouth fans joined in the celebrations as, through losing, they had \"helped\" relegate arch-rivals Southampton. The defeat itself mattered little to Portsmouth, as they would be unable to improve on their final position of 16th due to 15th-placed [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]' greater points tally.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2003\u201304 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], returning to the top flight after an absence of nine, one and six years respectively. They replaced [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], who had been relegated to the [[2004\u201305 Football League Championship|Championship]].

[[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] were the defending champions after going [[The Invincibles (football)|unbeaten]] the previous season. [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] won the title with a then record 95 points, which was previously set by [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the [[1993-94 FA Premier League|1993-94 season]], and later surpassed by [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] in the [[2017\u201318 Premier League|2017\u201318 season]], securing the title with a 2\u20130 win at the [[Reebok Stadium]] against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C|Bolton Wanderers]]. Chelsea also broke a number of other records during their campaign, most notably breaking the record of most games won in a single Premier League campaign, securing 29 wins in the league in home and away matches.\n\nIn the domestic cup competitions, [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] won the [[FA Cup]] after beating holders [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on penalties in the final. [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] won the [[Football League Cup]], beating [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] (who had defeated holders [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] in the 4th round) 3\u20132 after extra time.\n\n==Season summary==\nArsenal were the favourites to defend their title after finishing the [[2003\u201304 Arsenal F.C. season|previous season]] unbeaten, but they also faced competition in the form of regular challengers Manchester United and Chelsea, the latter under the new management of Portuguese [[Jos\u00e9 Mourinho]], who had just won the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] with [[FC Porto|Porto]]. Liverpool also had a new manager in Spaniard [[Rafael Ben\u00edtez]], who had just won [[La Liga]] and the [[2003\u201304 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] with [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] and were expected to challenge for the title too. Another managerial change at a club aiming for the top was at Tottenham Hotspur, who appointed [[Jacques Santini]], who had just led [[French national football team|France]] to the quarter-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2004|the 2004 European Championship]].\n\nAt the other end of the table, amongst those tipped for relegation were Norwich City, Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion, having all just been promoted from the First Division (which was rebranded this season as the Championship). Everton, Manchester City, Blackburn Rovers and Portsmouth were also tipped to struggle, the first three finishing just outside the relegation places the previous season and Portsmouth being in their second season.\n\nFor the first time since the advent of the Premier League in 1992, no team was mathematically relegated before the final day of the season. In each of the last three weekends of the season, the team that was bottom of the table at the start of the weekend finished it outside the drop zone. The final round of the season started on 15 May with [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] at the bottom, [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] one point ahead and [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]] a further point ahead, in the last safe spot.\n\nWest Brom, who had been bottom of the table and eight points from safety on Christmas Day, did their part by defeating [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] at home 2\u20130. Norwich, the only side to have their fate completely in their own hands, lost 6\u20130 at [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and went down. Southampton lost 2\u20131 at home to [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and were relegated after 27 years in the top flight. Palace, away to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]], were leading 2\u20131 after 71 minutes, but with eight minutes to go, Charlton's [[Jonathan Fortune]] equalised to relegate Palace. Thus, West Brom stayed up, becoming the first club in Premier League history to avoid relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas.\n\nArsenal's record-breaking unbeaten streak of 49 games was ended on 24 October 2004, when Manchester United beat them 2-0 at Old Trafford.\n\nAt the end of the 90 minutes in all four matches, cameras focused on West Brom's home ground, [[The Hawthorns]], as confirmation of other results began to filter through. Once the realisation dawned on the players and fans that survival had been achieved, a mass [[pitch invasion]] was sparked, with huge celebrations. The Portsmouth fans joined in the celebrations as, through losing, they had \"helped\" relegate arch-rivals Southampton. The defeat itself mattered little to Portsmouth, as they would be unable to improve on their final position of 16th due to 15th-placed [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]' greater points tally.\n\n==Teams==\nTwenty teams competed in the league&nbsp;\u2013 the top seventeen teams from the previous season and the three teams promoted from the [[2003\u201304 Football League First Division|First Division]]. The promoted teams were [[Norwich City F.C.|Norwich City]], [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]], returning to the top flight after an absence of nine, one and six years respectively. They replaced [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], who had been relegated to the [[2004\u201305 Football League Championship|Championship]].

In 1972, electron microscopy on stored human stool samples identified a virus, which was given the name \"Norwalk virus\". Numerous outbreaks with similar symptoms have been reported since.

In 1972, electron microscopy on stored human stool samples identified a virus, which was given the name \"Norwalk virus\". Numerous outbreaks with similar symptoms have been reported since. The [[cloning]] and sequencing of the Norwalk virus genome showed that these viruses have a genomic organization consistent with viruses belonging to the family [[Caliciviridae]].<ref name=\"pmid9015097\">{{cite journal | author = Kapikian AZ | title = Overview of viral gastroenteritis | journal = Arch.
