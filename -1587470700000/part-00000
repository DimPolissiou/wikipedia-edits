In May 1983, with the growth of suburban Westchester, the Guard unit abandoned Westchester Air National Guard Base and moved to [[Stewart International Airport]], in [[Orange County, New York|Orange County]].\n\nThe first scheduled airline flights were by [[American Airlines]] in late 1949 with a weekday morning flight from New York [[LaGuardia Airport]] to HPN continuing to [[Syracuse Hancock International Airport]] and beyond and returning in the evening. [[Mohawk Airlines]] replaced American in 1955; Mohawk and successor [[Allegheny Airlines]] served HPN until 1979. The first scheduled jet flight was a Mohawk [[BAC One-Eleven]] in 1965. Before the federal [[Airline Deregulation Act]] in 1978, the airport was served in 1976 by Allegheny Airlines [[BAC One-Eleven]]s and by several commuter air carriers including Air Speed, [[Command Airways]] and [[Commuter Airlines]].<ref>Feb. 1, 1976 Official Airline Guide</ref> [[Air Florida]] arrived in 1980 and [[United Airlines]] during the mid 1980s. [[American Airlines]] also resumed mainline service.

New start up carriers [[Air Florida]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Carnival Air Lines]] and [[Midway Airlines (1993\u20132003)|Midway Airlines]] also served the airport. [[AirTran Airways]] began service at the airport in 2006 with flights to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]] and [[West Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]. These flights ended on August 11, 2012.

The aircraft was low on fuel and allegedly flying erratically. HPN airport was closed at the time and no runway lights were illuminated. Police arrived on the scene and reported beer bottles falling out of the aircraft as they arrested the teens, all of whom were charged with various felonies relating to the unauthorized use of the aircraft, theft, and alcohol impairment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/23/nyregion/police-say-20yearold-stole-a-plane-and-flew-it-drunk.html|title=Police Say 20-Year-Old Stole a Plane and Flew It Drunk|last=Foderaro|first=Lisa W.|date=2005-06-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2019-12-31|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n[[JetBlue]] began service at the airport in 2007 and is now the airport's largest carrier with 11 daily round trips to five destinations. JetBlue and Delta are the only airlines with mainline jet aircraft at HPN.\n\nIn June 2009, [[Cape Air]] commenced service to Westchester with flights to [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]] and [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]]. Cape Air introduced service to [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon Municipal Airport]] in [[New Hampshire]] in early 2010. All Cape Air flights depart and arrive from the [[Signature Flight Support]] facility south of the Main Terminal due to a lack of ticket counter space in the main terminal building.\n\nIn June 2010, a regional airline affiliate for [[Air Canada]] announced it would cease all flights into the airport. Commuter [[code sharing]] service with [[Beechcraft]] turboprop aircraft was flown on behalf of Air Canada for several years between the airport and Toronto.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This ended international flights until service to the Bahamas began in 2011.  However, the airport currently does not have any international nonstop service.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, [[American Airlines]] ended its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional airline service to the airport and instead introduced [[American Connection]] flights operated by [[Chautauqua Airlines]] as a replacement flying smaller [[Embraer ERJ-140]] regional jet aircraft. Later, the American Connection name was dropped and American Eagle service returned.\n\nIn 2013, [[Delta Air Lines]] announced that it would begin seasonal service to [[Orlando]] starting in December of that year. This service is currently operated on a seasonal basis by regional [[code sharing]] affiliate [[Delta Connection]].\n\nIn December 2015, Tradewind Aviation began service to the [[Morrisville-Stowe State Airport|Morrisville-Stowe Airport]] in northern Vermont.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vtdigger.org/2015/09/18/passenger-service-from-morrisville-to-nyc-area-takes-flight/ | title=Passenger service from Morrisville to NYC area to take flight | publisher=VTDigger.com | date=18 September 2015 | accessdate=22 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, [[American Airlines]] announced nonstop service to [[Miami International Airport]] via its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] subsidiary. Flights would operate twice-daily with [[Embraer E-175]] aircraft flown by [[Republic Airways (airline)|Republic Airways]], with departures from HPN at 7 AM and 1:59 PM.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lohud.com/story/news/transit/2016/08/25/american-airlines-westchester-miami/89340548/|title=American adding Westchester-Miami flights|last=Coyne|first=Matt|website=lohud.com|language=en|access-date=2019-08-12}}</ref> Service commenced on December, 15 2016, only to cease in late 2017. This was the first commercial airline service addition since [[AirTran Airways]] folded.\n\nBetween December 2 and December 20, 2017, [[Delta Airlines]] upgauged 1-2 flights on select days to [[Boeing 717]] aircraft to test increased capacity feasibility to HPN. As of February 2020, the airline continues to use this aircraft for flights on the HPN-ATL route along with the [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ900]].\n\nThe airport limits the number of arriving and departing passengers to 240 per half hour or the airline is fined. Officially, this is said to improve service, but likely exists to pacify anti-airport residents in neighboring communities.<ref>https://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2016/04/06/westchester-airport-limits/82631862/</ref>\n\n==Noise abatement procedures==\nHPN is nestled between many existing neighborhoods and has many rules that must be followed.  HPN officials started the Westchester County Airport Aircraft Noise study which set up Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring Systems (ANOMS) around the airport.  The ANOMS measure the sound in the surveying area and compare it to the sound of airplanes and the sound of the neighborhoods surrounding the airport.  With the help of these devices, HPN officials have located the problems where noise is affecting the area the most.\n\nHPN has implemented six programs that help reduce noise.  The first program as stated earlier is the Voluntary Restraint from Flying or VRFF.  The VRFF is a curfew for planes to encourage them not to fly during the hours of midnight to six in the morning.  Another program is High Range Noise Event Program which uses the ANOMS.  If an ANOMS pick up reading of higher than 90 decibels that airplane is then contacted by HPN officials.

Some of the FBOs are particularly luxurious, providing [[limousine]] transportation services and deluxe surroundings.\n\nThere are three flight schools.  Performance Flight operates out of the Million Air at Hangar M, while Academy of Aviation operates out of Ross Aviation West at Hangar T. Wings Air offers helicopter flight training out of Hangar T. Additionally, the [http://www.wfc-hpn.org/ Westchester Flying Club], a private organization of pilots, is based at the airport as well as the [http://www.westchesteraviation.org/ Westchester Aviation Association], a not-for-profit organization which promotes aviation education and understanding on the part of government authorities and the public.\n\nWestchester County Airport is also the home of the [[New York Wing Civil Air Patrol]] headquarters, the Lt. Anthony L. Willsea Cadet Squadron (NY-422).\n\nAircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) is provided by Airport Operations Crews.  The airport owns three ARFF apparatus (three Oshkosh Striker 1500s), two of which are in service full-time.  The ARFF Crews only respond to aircraft emergencies.  All structure related fire and rescue calls go to the local fire departments.  For example, the Purchase Fire Department handles all structure calls on the southern part of the airfield, the Armonk Fire Department handles calls on the northern part and the Rye Brook/Port Chester Fire Department handle all calls on the east end, including the main terminal.  EMS calls are handled by Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook EMS, Harrison EMS and Armonk Fire/EMS depending on location of call.\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 191,017 total aircraft operations, an average of 523 per day: 23% commercial aviation, 48% heavy general aviation, and 29% light general aviation.

New start up carriers [[Air Florida]], [[AirTran Airways]], [[Carnival Air Lines]] and [[Midway Airlines (1993\u20132003)|Midway Airlines]] also served the airport. [[AirTran Airways]] began service at the airport in 2006 with flights to [[Hartsfield\u2013Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta]], [[Orlando International Airport|Orlando]] and [[West Palm Beach International Airport|West Palm Beach]]. These flights ended on August 11, 2012.

The aircraft was low on fuel and allegedly flying erratically. HPN airport was closed at the time and no runway lights were illuminated.

JetBlue and Delta are the only airlines with mainline jet aircraft at HPN.\n\nIn June 2009, [[Cape Air]] commenced service to Westchester with flights to [[Nantucket Memorial Airport|Nantucket]] and [[Martha's Vineyard Airport|Martha's Vineyard]] in [[Massachusetts]]. Cape Air introduced service to [[Lebanon Municipal Airport (New Hampshire)|Lebanon Municipal Airport]] in [[New Hampshire]] in early 2010. All Cape Air flights depart and arrive from the [[Signature Flight Support]] facility south of the Main Terminal due to a lack of ticket counter space in the main terminal building.\n\nIn June 2010, a regional airline affiliate for [[Air Canada]] announced it would cease all flights into the airport. Commuter [[code sharing]] service with [[Beechcraft]] turboprop aircraft was flown on behalf of Air Canada for several years between the airport and Toronto.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This ended international flights until service to the Bahamas began in 2011.  However, the airport currently does not have any international nonstop service.\n\nOn November 18, 2010, [[American Airlines]] ended its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional airline service to the airport and instead introduced [[American Connection]] flights operated by [[Chautauqua Airlines]] as a replacement flying smaller [[Embraer ERJ-140]] regional jet aircraft. Later, the American Connection name was dropped and American Eagle service returned.\n\nIn 2013, [[Delta Air Lines]] announced that it would begin seasonal service to [[Orlando]] starting in December of that year. This service is currently operated on a seasonal basis by regional [[code sharing]] affiliate [[Delta Connection]].\n\nIn December 2015, Tradewind Aviation began service to the [[Morrisville-Stowe State Airport|Morrisville-Stowe Airport]] in northern Vermont.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://vtdigger.org/2015/09/18/passenger-service-from-morrisville-to-nyc-area-takes-flight/ | title=Passenger service from Morrisville to NYC area to take flight | publisher=VTDigger.com | date=18 September 2015 | accessdate=22 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2016, [[American Airlines]] announced nonstop service to [[Miami International Airport]] via its [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] subsidiary.

As of February 2020, the airline continues to use the aircraft for flights on the HPN-ATL route along with the [[Bombardier CRJ700 series|Bombardier CRJ900]].\n\nThe airport limits the number of arriving and departing passengers to 240 per half hour or the airline is fined. This is said officially to improve service, but actually exists to pacify anti-airport residents who reside in neighboring communities.<ref>https://www.lohud.com/story/news/investigations/2016/04/06/westchester-airport-limits/82631862/</ref>\n\n==Noise abatement procedures==\nHPN is nestled between many existing neighborhoods and has many rules that must be followed.  HPN officials started the Westchester County Airport Aircraft Noise study which set up Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring Systems (ANOMS) around the airport.  The ANOMS measure the sound in the surveying area and compare it to the sound of airplanes and the sound of the neighborhoods surrounding the airport.  With the help of these devices, HPN officials have located the problems where noise is affecting the area the most.\n\nHPN has implemented six programs that help reduce noise.  The first program as stated earlier is the Voluntary Restraint from Flying or VRFF.  The VRFF is a curfew for planes to encourage them not to fly during the hours of midnight to six in the morning.  Another program is High Range Noise Event Program which uses the ANOMS.  If an ANOMS pick up reading of higher than 90 decibels that airplane is then contacted by HPN officials.  HPN also has programs that do not allow airplane larger than 12,500 pounds to takeoff at the runway intersections, or run-up their engines without prior approval of airport operations.\n\n==Local context==\nAfter several renovations, as well as discussions about the airport's viability,<ref>{{Cite news| first=Lisa | last=Foderaro | title= The Talk of Westchester County Airport; Airport Plan: A Travelers' Oasis or a Threat to Neighbors? | date=1989-12-07 | publisher= | url =https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE0D81730F934A35751C1A96F948260 | work =New York Times | pages = | accessdate = 2008-01-15 | language = }}</ref> the airport is currently served by six scheduled passenger airlines with flights to sixteen destinations in the [[United States]].

Although varied in services offered, the FBOs at Westchester County Airport provide [[Jet A]] and [[100LL]] fueling services, repairs and maintenance, aircraft tiedowns, [[de-icing]], [[US Customs|United States Customs]], and other aircraft services. Some of the FBOs are particularly luxurious, providing [[limousine]] transportation services and deluxe surroundings.\n\nThere are three flight schools.  Performance Flight operates out of the Million Air at Hangar M, while Academy of Aviation operates out of Ross Aviation West at Hangar T. Wings Air offers helicopter flight training out of Hangar T. Additionally, the [http://www.wfc-hpn.org/ Westchester Flying Club], a private organization of pilots, is based at the airport as well as the [http://www.westchesteraviation.org/ Westchester Aviation Association], a not-for-profit organization which promotes aviation education and understanding on the part of government authorities and the public.\n\nWestchester County Airport is also the home of the [[New York Wing Civil Air Patrol]] headquarters, the Lt. Anthony L. Willsea Cadet Squadron (NY-422).\n\nAircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) is provided by Airport Operations Crews.  The airport owns three ARFF apparatus (three Oshkosh Striker 1500s), two of which are in service full-time.  The ARFF Crews only respond to aircraft emergencies.  All structure related fire and rescue calls go to the local fire departments.  For example, the Purchase Fire Department handles all structure calls on the southern part of the airfield, the Armonk Fire Department handles calls on the northern part and the Rye Brook/Port Chester Fire Department handle all calls on the east end, including the main terminal.  EMS calls are handled by Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook EMS, Harrison EMS and Armonk Fire/EMS depending on location of call.\n\nIn 2010 the airport had 191,017 total aircraft operations, an average of 523 per day: 23% commercial aviation, 48% heavy general aviation, and 29% light general aviation. There are 316 aircraft, including helicopters, based out of this airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://airport.westchestergov.com/about-us |title=About Us |publisher=Airport.westchestergov.com |date=2012-05-22 |accessdate=2012-06-15}}</ref>\n\n===Terminal===\n[[Image:HPN Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|The gate area in the main terminal]]\n\nWestchester County Airport has one small three-level terminal with six gates, of which only four can be used simultaneously because only four aircraft can be scheduled to use the terminal's ramp at any given time.

The incubation period is also useful to count the number of infected people.<ref name=\u201dNelson\u201d />\n\nThe period from the time of infection to the time of becoming infectious is called the ''pre-infectious period'' or the ''latent period''. During the pre-infectious or latent period, a host may or may not show symptoms (i.e. the incubation period may or may not be over), but in both cases the host is not capable of infecting other hosts i.e. transmitting pathogens to other hosts. The latent period, rather than the incubation period, has more influence on the spreading dynamics of an infectious disease or epidemic.<ref name=\u201dNelson\u201d />\n\nThe time interval during which the host is infectious, i.e. the pathogens can be transmitted directly or indirectly from the infected host to another individual, is called the ''infectious period'', defined as the period from the end of the pre-infectious period or the latent period until the time when the host can no longer transmit the infection to other individuals. During the infectious period, a host may or may not show symptoms, but he or she is capable of infecting other individuals. The duration of the infectious period depends on the ability of the infected host individual to mount an immune response.<ref name=\u201dVynnycky1\u201d /> \nIn some cases, the pre-infectious or latent period and the incubation period are mostly of the same duration. In this case, the infected individual becomes infectious at around the same time he starts showing symptoms. In certain other infectious diseases such as smallpox, the host becomes infectious after the onset of symptoms. In this case, the latent period is longer than the incubation period. In these two cases, the disease can be effectively controlled using symptomatic surveillance.<ref name=\u201dNelson\u201d/> A related term is the ''shedding period'', which is defined as the period during which a host or patient excretes pathogens through saliva, urine, feces or other bodily fluids.  \n\nHowever, for some infectious diseases, the symptoms of the clinical disease may appear after the host becomes infectious. In this case, the pre-infectious or latent period has a shorter duration than the incubation period, the infectious period begins before the end of the incubation period and the host can infect others for some time without showing any noticeable symptoms. This early or mild stage of infection whose symptoms stay below the level of clinical detection is called ''[[subclinical infection]]''<ref>{{Citation |title=HIV/AIDS Glossary |publisher=National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |url=https://aidsinfo.nih.gov/understanding-hiv-aids/glossary/679/subclinical-infection}}</ref> and the individual concerned is called an ''[[asymptomatic carrier]]'' of the disease. For example, in HIV/AIDS, the incubation period lasts years longer than the latent period. So an HIV infected individual can show no symptoms and unwittingly infect other susceptible individuals for many years. In cases like these, symptomatic surveillance-based control measures are not likely be effective, because a considerable proportion of the transmission may take place before the onset of symptoms and this have to be taken into account when designing [[Infection prevention and control|control]] measures.<ref name=\u201dNelson\u201d/>\n\nThe infectious period is a very important element in the infectious disease spreading dynamics. If the infectious period is long, then the measure of secondary infections (represented by the ''[[basic reproduction number]]'', R<sub>0</sub>) will generally by larger, regardless of the infectiousness of the disease. For example, even though HIV/AIDS has a very low transmission potential per sexual act, its basic reproduction number is still very high because of its unusually long infectious period spanning many years.<ref name=\u201dNelson\u201d/> From the viewpoint of controlling an epidemic, the goal is to reduce the effective infectious period either by treatment or by isolating the patient from the community. Sometimes a treatment can paradoxically increase the effective infectious period by preventing death through supportive care and thereby increasing the probability of infection of other individuals.<ref name=\u201dNelson\u201d />\n\nThe ''generation time'' (or ''generation interval'') of an infectious disease is the time interval between the beginning of infection in an individual to the time that person transmits to another individual. The generation time specifies how fast infections are spreading in the community with the passing of each generation.<ref name=\u201dNelson\u201d/> In contrast, the effective reproductive number determines in what number the infections are spreading in the community with the passing of each generation. The latent period and the infectious period helps determine the generation time of an infection. The mean generation time is equal to the sum of the mean latent period and one-half of the mean infectious period, given that infectiousness is evenly distributed across the infectious period.<ref name=\u201dNelson\u201d/> \n\nSince the precise moment of infection is very difficult and almost impossible to detect, the generation time is not properly observable for two successive hosts. Generally, in infectious disease statistics, the onset of clinical symptoms for all the hosts are reported. For two successive generations (or cases or hosts) in a chain of infection, the ''serial interval'' is defined as the period of time between the onset of clinical symptoms in the first host and the onset of analogous clinical symptoms in the second host. Just like the generation time, the length of the serial interval depends on the lengths of the latent period, the infectious period and the incubation period. Therefore the serial interval is often used as a proxy measure to estimate the generation time.<ref name=\u201dNelson\u201d /> <ref name=\u201dVynnycky1\u201d />\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n", "text_old": "In [[epidemiology]], particularly in the discussion of [[infectious disease dynamics]] (modeling), the '''Latent period''' or the '''Pre-infectious period''' is the time interval between when an individual or host is [[infection|infected]] by a [[pathogen]] and when he or she becomes infectious, i.e. capable of transmitting pathogens to other susceptible individuals.<ref name=\u201dNelson\u201d>{{Citation |title= Infectious disease epidemiology: Theory and Practice |editor1= Kenrad E.

{"title_page": "Next Generation Air Transportation System", "text_new": "{{short description|Modernization project of the United States' National Airspace System}}\n{{advert|date=May 2018}}\nThe '''Next Generation Air Transportation System''' ('''NextGen''')  is an ongoing modernization project of the [[United States]] [[National Airspace System]] (NAS). The US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) began work on NextGen improvements in 2007 and plans to have all major components in place by 2025.<ref>[https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf 2016 Update to The Business Case for the Next Generation Air Transportation System] based on the Future of the NAS Report</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe goals of the modernization include using new technologies and procedures to increase the safety, efficiency, capacity, access, flexibility, predictability, and resilience of the NAS while reducing the [[environmental impact of aviation]].\n\n== History ==\nThe need for NextGen became apparent during the summer of 2000 when air travel was impeded by severe congestion and costly delays. Two years later, the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry recommended that a multi-agency task force develop an integrated plan to transform the U.S. air transportation system. In 2003, Congress enacted the Vision 100 \u2013 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, which established the [[Joint Planning and Development Office]] (JPDO) to create a unified vision of what the U.S. air transportation system should deliver for the next generation and beyond, to develop and coordinate long-term research plans, and to sponsor cross-agency mission research.\n\nThe result of the JPDO's efforts was the creation of the \u201cIntegrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tg.hfes.org/astg/papers/Natl_Plan_NGATS_v5.pdf|title=Integrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which defined high-level goals, objectives, and requirements to transform the air transportation system. In addition to the Department of Transportation and FAA, the plan involved other government agencies with responsibilities in air transportation services, including the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), [[National Weather Service]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and [[Transportation Security Administration]].\n\nThe JPDO released the \u201cConcept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|title=Concept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012213821/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|archive-date=2015-10-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> to the aviation stakeholder community in 2007. The concept of operations provided the overview of NextGen goals for 2025. Growth of the NextGen concept was an evolutionary, step-by-step process, and the JPDO document continued to be updated through 2011. The same year, the FAA published the first version of its expanded Operational Evolution Partnership,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextor.org/Conferences/200709_NAS_Performance/0905_2b_Swennson%20-%20OEP.pdf|title=Operational Evolution Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which outlined the agency's path to NextGen through 2025.\n\nThe original integrated national plan included airport surface and passenger terminal operations and was known as a \u201ccurb-to-curb\u201d solution. The concept of operations was intended to drive cross-agency research to validate the concepts and to eliminate ideas and alternatives that were not operationally feasible or beneficial. The FAA focused on the pieces of the air transportation system for which it was responsible \u2013 the \u201cgate-to-gate\u201d components. In 2011, the FAA published the report \u201cNextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations for the National Airspace System\u201d. The FAA concept of operations was consistent with the JPDO's broad set of objectives, including maintaining safety and security, increasing capacity and efficiency, ensuring access to airspace and airports, and mitigating environmental impacts. The report identified several key transformational concepts as necessary to achieve NextGen goals and objectives, such as precision navigation and network-enabled information access, and the FAA has made progress on them.\n\nChanges were underway in 2008 when the FAA started to move key parts of NextGen, such as [[Automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast|Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast]] (ADS-B), from design to delivery. NextGen progress involved expanded research and development capability, participation by the aviation industry and international partners, and support by the White House and Congress (which are highlighted in this section).\n\nThe agency established a research and development facility, known as a testbed, at [[Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University|Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], Florida, in 2008. In 2010, the FAA dedicated another testbed, the NextGen Integration and Evaluation Capability Laboratory at the [[William J. Hughes Technical Center]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for researchers to simulate and evaluate the effects of NextGen components on the NAS. The lab's capability grew in 2013 with a contract awarded to [[General Dynamics]] to provide engineering, software design and development, infrastructure, and administrative support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press-releases/2013/03/general-dynamics-awarded-12-million-support-federal-aviation|title=General Dynamics Awarded $12 Million to Support Federal Aviation Administration System Engineering 2020 Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the FAA signed agreements with [[Honeywell]] and ACSS to accelerate testing and installation of NextGen technology to detect and alert pilots of safety hazards on the airport surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2008/11/03/faa-signs-contract-with-honeywell-acss/|title=FAA Signs Contract with Honeywell, ACSS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[NetJets]] also agreed to equip part of its fleet to test some programs in various areas of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netjets.com/News/2015/faa-partners-with-netjets-on-implementing-nextgen-technologies--/|title=FAA Partners With NetJets on Implementing NextGen Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> By 2010, the FAA awarded [[Computer Support Services]] Inc. a $280 million contract to perform engineering work for NextGen, the first of six contracts that would be awarded under an umbrella portfolio contract.

In 2012, the FAA selected [[Harris Corporation|Harris Corp.]], which then subcontracted [[Dataprobe]], to develop the [[National Airspace System Voice Switch|NAS Voice System]] and manage a $331 million Data Communications Integrated Services contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/09/harris-corporation-awarded-331-million-contract-by-faa-for-data/|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $331 Million Contract by FAA for Data Communications Integrated Services Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/08/harris-corporation-awarded-291-million-contract-to-provide-federal-aviation|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $291 Million Contract to Provide Federal Aviation Administration's New National Air Traffic Control Communications System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCommercial airlines also became involved in NextGen. In 2011, the FAA signed an agreement with [[JetBlue]] to allow the carrier to fly select flights equipped with ADS-B, opening the airline to improved routing and giving the FAA NextGen data through real-time operational evaluations. [[United Airlines]] in 2013 announced plans to become the first carrier to equip a portion of its fleet with avionics necessary for [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] (Data Comm) under the FAA NextGen Data Comm avionics equipage program. The program was funded to equip 1,900 aircraft across the industry to ensure enough aircraft would participate in Data Comm.\n\nTo develop industry consensus for the FAA's midterm goals, the agency established a new task force carried out through [[RTCA, Incorporated|RTCA]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|title=NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force Report Sept. 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812102308/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAA wanted the task force to examine how industry could contribute to and benefit from the NextGen effort; accordingly, the agency released a plan in 2010 on how to implement recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|title=FAA Response to Recommendations of the RTCA NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824192936/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  established in 2010 to address the task force recommendation to continue industry collaboration, is a federal advisory group comprising aviation stakeholders formed to provide advice on policy-level NextGen implementation issues facing the aviation community. The FAA and NAC in 2014 agreed on the NextGen Priorities Joint Implementation Plan to accelerate delivery of four core NextGen initiatives over three years to improve efficiency: optimizing airports with multiple runways (e.g. via simultaneous parallel landings with reduced separation), increasing the efficiency of surface operations, reconfiguring the navigation system from ground-based to primarily satellite-based, and improving communications between aircraft and the ground through a digital system.\n\nThe FAA seeks to ensure international [[air traffic management]] interoperability and system harmonization for improved safety and efficiency. In 2010, the FAA and the European Commission agreed to cooperate in 22 areas to help in joint research and development of NextGen and [[Single European Sky ATM Research]] (SESAR) projects. By 2012, the FAA and the A6 alliance of European air navigation service providers agreed to work toward an interoperable aviation system, and work together to deploy and implement NextGen and SESAR.\n\nExecutive Order 13479, Transformation of the National Air Transportation System,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=84969|title=Executive Order 13479\u2014Transformation of the National Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> signed in 2008 mandated the Secretary of Transportation to establish a NextGen support staff.

The FAA also issued a final rule mandating NextGen performance requirements for aircraft surveillance equipment. It requires aircraft operating in most controlled U.S. airspace to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020.\n\n==Justification==\nA Department of Transportation 30-year outlook report published in 2016, \u201cBeyond Traffic: Trends and Choices 2045,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/policy-initiatives/beyond-traffic-2045-final-report|title=Beyond Traffic: 2045 Final Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> estimated flight delays and congestion cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year.

The agency worked with industry to identify capabilities taking advantage of existing aircraft equipage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> This strategy enabled airspace users to realize early benefits while keeping NextGen on course to achieve its long-term goal of time-based air traffic management.\n\nNext, the FAA started replacing its foundational infrastructure. Based on previous lessons learned, the agency determined the best way to upgrade its services was to begin with a new infrastructure that could accommodate state-of-the-art enabling technologies and advanced capabilities rather than adding one-off improvements to an aging infrastructure that couldn't accommodate broader transformation.\n\nFAA modernization programs, such as [[ERAM|En Route Automation Modernization]] (ERAM) and [[Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System|Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement]] (TAMR), are foundational pieces upon which the FAA could build the NextGen vision. These programs support NextGen objectives with modern software architectures that serve as the platform for new capabilities for air traffic controllers and managers.\n\nThe FAA uses a widely accepted model for building large-scale automation systems. Program lifecycles are continuous with a planned schedule of technology refreshes. For example, the FAA finished installing the original hardware for ERAM in 2008, and completed software and program acceptance in 2015. In 2016, the agency updated the technology of all major system components that were becoming obsolete. This is a common approach to maintain the latest level of technology.\n\nOn top of the foundational systems, the FAA then identified key enabling systems that improve communication, information sharing, navigation, surveillance, traffic flow optimization, and weather systems.\n\nChanges to the national airspace necessary to implement these individual concepts yield additional benefits. Integrating these systems is anticipated to transform the air traffic management system in an effort to keep pace with the growing needs of an increasingly diverse mix of air transportation system users without sacrificing safety.\n\nIntegration is necessary to achieve an FAA long-term goal of trajectory-based operations (TBO). TBO is a method of strategically planning and managing air traffic from airport to airport for optimal performance by using the aircraft's ability to fly precise paths; metering traffic flow using time instead of distance; and sharing information between pilots, flight dispatchers, and controllers and managers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ang/offices/tc/library/Storyboard/tbo.html#welcome|title=TBO Vision 2025 Storyboard|date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith TBO, the FAA and operators will be able to tell with a great deal of accuracy where aircraft will be at any point in time along the way to its destination. This will provide improved knowledge of the estimated departure and arrival time at each navigational waypoint along the entire route of flight. These times will be shared between air and ground automation systems and used to improve assessments of how to balance demand and capacity, and minimize the impact of disruptions due to weather, or system or facility outages. NextGen benefits extend to all phases of flight operations.\n\nBecause NextGen is a complex, large-scale system of systems implemented over more than 18 years, its development and implementation can be difficult to follow. Systems are always in various stages of lifecycle management from research and development to technical refreshes. FAA planning reports are used to map the evolution from the legacy National Airspace System (NAS) to NextGen. To manage NextGen with short-term funding horizons, the FAA rolled out improvements in smaller increments with more program segments to ensure affordability.\n\nThe FAA has scheduled initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide the complete set of anticipated NextGen benefits. Beyond 2025, the FAA expects to accrue benefits through enterprise-level advanced applications, additional aircraft equipage, and full workforce adoption of a time-based air traffic management system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is using knowledge gained since 2011 when it published the NextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations. Working closely with stakeholders, the FAA invested in research and pre-implementation work to determine the feasibility of advanced concepts and their associated benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The aviation community understood that many, but not all, of the concepts would produce positive business cases once research and pre-implementation work was under way, and that some goals would be replaced by other concepts in an evolving aviation environment.

The FAA is making progress in transforming the NAS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-10-24/faa-declares-steady-progress-nextgen-atc-modernization|title=FAA Declares Steady Progress on NextGen ATC Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2017-02-15/faas-nextgen-making-progress-airline-pilots-union-asserts|title=FAA's NextGen Making Progress, Airline Pilots Union Asserts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2017/03/02/faa-ready-review-us-air-traffic-modernization/|title=FAA Ready to Review US Air Traffic Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2015/10/23/datacomm-eram-ads-b-huerta-touts-nextgen-milestones/|title=DataComm, ERAM, ADS-B: Huerta Touts NextGen Milestones|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSix concepts that posed too high a technical risk, for instance those with no available technical solution, have been deferred beyond 2030.

It is not one technology, product, or goal. Rather, it encompasses many technologies, policies, and procedures, and changes are implemented after thorough safety testing. It is composed of many elements that provide benefits individually and collectively to transform the air transportation system.\n\n=== Communication ===\nController Pilot Data Link Communications, also known as [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] or just Data Comm, uses typed digital messages to supplement voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots. The first part of the program for 55 airports, tower departure clearance services, finished in 2016 more than two years ahead of schedule. It is helping equipped aircraft take off sooner through messages quickly exchanged and clearly understood.\n\nUnlike voice messages, Data Comm messages sent by controllers are delivered only to the intended aircraft, which eliminates the chance of another pilot acting on instructions for another aircraft with a similar call sign. It avoids the chance of misunderstood messages because of busy radio chatter or variations in the way people speak, and it can be a backup if a microphone malfunctions. It also preserves radio bandwidth when voice communication is necessary or preferred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/cover/88451.html?hq_e=el&hq_m=3280857&hq_l=2&hq_v=702ed8c35e|title=NextGen Data Comm Facilitates Digital DCL|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUsing Data Comm, tower air traffic controllers can send pilots of equipped aircraft departure clearance instructions to read, accept, and load into their flight management system with the push of a button. Messages also are sent to [[flight dispatcher]]s, giving everyone a shared awareness for faster reactions to changing circumstances, such as approaching thunderstorms.\n\nData Comm saves aircraft time waiting to take off, particularly when routes change, which reduces fuel use and engine exhaust emissions. It lowers the chances of delays or cancellations when weather affects the flight route. Pilots and controllers also can spend more time on other critical tasks, which enhances safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/general-news/20160624/lax-unveils-data-comm-aircraft-texting-system-designed-to-reduce-flight-delays|title=LAX unveils Data Comm aircraft texting system designed to reduce flight delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kutv.com/news/local/new-data-comm-reduces-wait-time-on-slc-runways|title=New Data Comm system reduces wait time on SLC runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/37d10b72c9b8402099c602afc0391f44/Pilots,-air-traffic-controllers-shifting-to-text-messaging|title=Pilots, air traffic controllers shifting to text messaging|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235508/https://www.apnews.com/37d10b72c9b8402099c602afc0391f44/Pilots,-air-traffic-controllers-shifting-to-text-messaging|archive-date=2018-01-19|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-ohare-pilot-texting-0930-biz-20160929-story.html|title=Pilots to start texting at O'Hare, Midway \u2014 but it's not what you think|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/faa-shows-off-new-air-traffic-communications-at-msp/419214164/|title=\"FAA shows off new air-traffic communications at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-flights-benefiting-from-new-text-based-tech-faa-says-1.13276922|title=NYC flights benefiting from new text-based tech, FAA says|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/pilot-text-messages-are-saving-you-from-flight-delays/|title=Pilot text messages are saving you from flight delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-09-28/faa-accelerates-data-communications-roll-out-atc-towers|title=FAA Accelerates Data Communications Roll Out to ATC Towers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/27/airlines-flight-controllers-data-communications/91177576/|title=Less chat, more action for airlines, flight controllers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crankyflier.com/2016/06/28/a-demo-on-how-data-comm-is-going-to-make-flying-better/|title=A Demo On How Data Comm Is Going to Make Flying Better|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/new-direct-digital-link-between-tower-and-cockpit-will-speed-planes-on-their-way/2016/09/27/50eb9ec8-843b-11e6-a3ef-f35afb41797f_story.html|title=New direct digital link between tower and cockpit will speed planes on their way|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBased on Data Comm's success, air carriers requested and the FAA approved in 2017 seven more airports to receive tower services to be completed by 2019.

More types of air traffic controller messages will be available, including the ability to reroute multiple aircraft.

In critical situations, they continue to be the primary form of controller-pilot interaction. For routine communications between pilots and controllers, Data Comm will increase efficiency and airspace capacity. Data Comm is expected to save operators more than $10 billion over the 30-year life cycle of the program and the FAA about $1 billion in future operating costs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/data_comm/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Data Communications|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313110025/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/data_comm/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Navigation ===\n[[Performance-based navigation|Performance Based Navigation]] (PBN) is an [[instrument flight rules]]<nowiki/> way of moving through airspace that varies depending equipage, navigational aids, and pilot training. Performance standards for certain airspace are conveyed to pilots through navigation specifications published by the FAA that identify the aircraft avionics and choice of ground- or satellite-based navigation aids that may be used to meet performance requirements.\n\nPBN comprises [[area navigation]] (RNAV) and [[required navigation performance]] (RNP). With RNAV, equipped aircraft fly any desired path within the coverage of ground- or space-based navigation aids, within the capability of aircraft equipage, or both. RNP is an advanced form of RNAV. Aircraft must be equipped to monitor onboard navigation performance and alert pilots trained to use it if a requirement is unmet during an operation. Aircraft can operate safely near mountainous terrain or in congested airspace by using RNP procedures.\n\nPBN primarily uses satellite-enabled technology and creates precise, repeatable, and predictable 3-D flight paths free from the constraints previously imposed by the physical locations of ground-based navigation infrastructure. A new route structure makes straighter paths possible for greater efficiency, and more routes can fit into the same airspace, which increases capacity. From 2009\u20132016, PBN procedures available nearly tripled at airports across the nation. As of December 2019, the FAA has published more than 9,600 PBN procedures and routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/procedures/ifp_inventory_summary/|title=Instrument Flight Procedures (IFP) Inventory Summary|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2019|website=Federal Aviation Administration|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These consist of RNAV [[standard instrument departure]]s, T-Routes (1,200 feet above the surface to 18,000 feet of altitude), Q-Routes (18,000\u201345,000 feet of altitude), RNAV [[Standard terminal arrival route|standard terminal arrivals]] (STAR), RNAV (GPS) approaches, and RNP approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Of the airports that publish [[instrument approach]] procedures, 96 percent publish PBN approach procedures and 31 percent use only PBN approach procedures.\n\nRNAV STAR procedures can provide a [[continuous descent approach]] also known as an optimized profile descent from cruising altitude to save fuel and reduce emissions and noise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/houston-nextgen-plane-descents/|title=Planes Are Finally Making Logical Descents Onto American Runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA has published many RNAV STAR procedures with this capability that enable aircraft to fly closer to the airport at a more fuel-efficient altitude before descending, which also saves fuel by eliminating level-offs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|title=New Analysis Shows Big Benefits at Minneapolis International Airport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628094052/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|archive-date=2017-06-28|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|title=Changes to Houston\u2019s Airspace Bring Millions in Benefits to Local Airports|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201103647/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|archive-date=2016-02-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> These procedures can be flown when available and when pilots are able to use them.\n\nUsing the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]]<nowiki/>, instrument-rated pilots now can land at airports where that was previously impossible using just [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]<nowiki/>.

Aircraft flying in most controlled airspace are required to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020. Instead of using ground-based radar to receive aircraft position, speed, and direction every five to 12 seconds, aircraft equipped with newer [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] transponders determine this information and then automatically send it out every second to air traffic control. ADS-B is always on and requires no operator intervention. It depends on an accurate satellite signal for position data, enhances surveillance services, and continuously broadcasts aircraft position and other data to ground stations and aircraft equipped to receive ADS-B. Pilots and air traffic controllers can for the first time see the same real-time display of air traffic, which substantially improves situational awareness for improved safety.\n\nThe FAA completed installation of new ground radio infrastructure in 2014, and coverage is available in all 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Gulf of Mexico, and area off both coasts. Integration of ADS-B into en route and terminal automation platforms was completed in 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=94678|title=FAA Successfully Completes Final ADS-B Milestone|last=|first=|date=October 7, 2019|work=FAA News and Updates|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is evaluating space-based ADS-B surveillance services for oceanic airspace as part of a project called Advanced Surveillance Enhanced Procedural Separation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/faa-takes-steps-toward-space-based-ads-b-track-aircraft|title=FAA Takes Steps Toward Space-Based ADS-B To Track Aircraft|last=|first=|date=December 12, 2019|work=Aviation Week|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Moving from the current system of ADS-B ground stations to radios hosted on satellites offers the potential for reduced separation standards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2017/04/27/faa-aireon-announce-space-based-ads-b-flight-test-success/|title=FAA and Aireon Announce Space-Based ADS-B Flight Test Success|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2017-05-15/faa-nav-canada-and-aireon-test-space-based-ads-b|title=FAA, Nav Canada and Aireon Test Space-based ADS-B|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.getconnected.aero/2017/04/faa-aireon-next-gen-ads-b/|title=FAA and Aireon announce next-gen ADS-B test success|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Even with the capabilities offered by ADS-B through satellite technology, surveillance radar is still relevant and will be used as a supplement and ultimately as backup to ADS-B in the event of service disruption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/global-advance-ads-b|title=Global Advance Of ADS-B|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926145530/http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/global-advance-ads-b|archive-date=2016-09-26}}</ref>\n\n==== ADS-B Out ====\nWith ADS-B Out, surveillance coverage increases because ground stations can be provided in locations where obstructions or physical limitations don't allow radar.

Coverage extends beyond facility boundaries, enabling controllers to handle traffic more efficiently. This coverage is possible because ERAM can process data from 64 radars versus 24.\n\nFor pilots, ERAM increases flexible routing around congestion, weather, and other restrictions. Real-time air traffic management and information sharing on flight restrictions improves airlines\u2019 ability to plan flights with minimal changes.

This platform offers a single point of access for more than 100 products, categorized into aeronautical, flight and traffic flow, and weather data. Producers can publish data once, and approved consumers can access needed information through a single connection, an improvement over the legacy way of connecting two systems with fixed network connections and custom point-to-point application-level data interfaces. The new format supports collaboration within domestic and international aviation communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2015/10/09/evaluating-future-global-swim-implementation/|title=Evaluating Future Global SWIM Implementation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015, the SWIM program completed its first segment, which established a common infrastructure and connection points at all en route traffic control centers. The program's second segment in 2016 established a service-oriented architecture \u2014 composed of producers, consumers, and a registry \u2014 and connected National Airspace System (NAS) programs, such as the Traffic Flow Management System, to provide large data sources for consumers. Several enhancements are being added, including improved security, and SWIM continues to add NAS air traffic management content providers and consumers.\n\nAs of 2019, 11 NAS programs and six external organizations produce data for 80 services sent via the SWIM network. More than 400 consumers are registered to access this data.

The NWP program will establish a common weather processing platform to replace the legacy FAA weather processor systems and supply new capabilities. The fully automated NWP will identify safety hazards around airports and in cruising altitude airspace. It will support strategic traffic flow management, including the translated weather information needed to predict route blockage and airspace capacity constraints up to eight hours in advance. NWP will use advanced algorithms to create current and predicted aviation-specific weather information with data from the FAA and [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA)<nowiki/> radar and sensors, and NOAA forecast models. Part of the NWP, the Aviation Weather Display consolidates the current Weather and Radar Processor, Integrated Terminal Weather System, and the Corridor Integrated Weather System displays. The Aviation Weather Display will provide consistent weather information at a glance for en route and terminal controllers, and includes NWP and NOAA weather products.\n\nCSS-Wx will be the single producer of weather data, products, and imagery within the NAS, using standards-based weather dissemination via SWIM. It will consolidate and enable the decommissioning of legacy weather dissemination systems. It also offers NWP and NOAA weather products, and other weather sources for integration into air traffic decision support systems, improving the quality of traffic management decisions and enhancing controller productivity during severe weather. CSS-Wx information consumers will include air traffic controllers and managers, commercial and general aviation operators, and the flying public.\n\nThe FAA's Weather Technology in the Cockpit team of researchers are experts on the pitfalls of how weather is displayed in [[general aviation]] cockpits. Their main research goal is to encourage improvements in how meteorological information is shown in the cockpit so pilots can consistently and accurately interpret that information, understand its limitations and use it effectively to avoid bad weather.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nbaa.org/events/bace/2016/newsroom/news/20161102-faa-teams-working-to-improve-quality-of-available-weather-information-to-pilots.php\\|title=FAA Teams Working to Improve Quality of Available Weather Information to Pilots|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180120070347/https://www.nbaa.org/events/bace/2016/newsroom/news/20161102-faa-teams-working-to-improve-quality-of-available-weather-information-to-pilots.php|archive-date=2018-01-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ams.confex.com/ams/93Annual/webprogram/Paper220086.html|title=The FAA's Weather Technology in the Cockpit Program - An Overview and Discussion of Challenges Ahead|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Multiple Runway Operations and Separation Management ===\nEfficiency of multiple runway operations (MRO), particularly those that are closely spaced, has been limited by safety risks, including collisions and [[wake turbulence]]<nowiki/> with nearby aircraft.

The FAA Office of Environment and Energy Research and Development is working to reduce air and water pollution, carbon dioxide emissions that may affect climate, and noise that can disturb residents near airports. Aircraft airframe and engine technology, alternative fuels, air traffic management modernization and operational improvements, improved scientific knowledge and integrated modeling, and policies, environmental standards, and market-based measures will contribute toward meeting almost all of these goals. Noise and emissions will be the main environmental problems on National Airspace System capacity and flexibility unless they are effectively managed and mitigated. \n\nSince the late 1970s, the number of people exposed to significant aircraft noise dropped by more than 95 percent while operations more than doubled. Even with this decrease, community concern regarding aircraft noise is climbing. The FAA aims to minimize the impact of noise on residential areas without compromising safety. The agency's goal is to reduce the number of people around airports exposed to a day-night average aircraft sound level of 65 decibels to less than 300,000 by 2018. One way the agency plans to achieve that is by adopting a new noise standard for certain newly certificated subsonic jet airplanes and subsonic transport category large airplanes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|title=NextGen Update: 2017 Environment and Energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313094224/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA survey, the largest of its kind, about aircraft noise exposure and its effects on communities around airports was completed in 2016.

In addition, the FAA is conducting research in other impact areas, such as sleep disturbance, cardiovascular health, and children's learning. The FAA also is examining the potential noise impacts of new entrants, such as unmanned aircraft systems, civil supersonic aircraft, and commercial space vehicles.\n\nThe Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN) program is a public-private partnership under NextGen to accelerate development and commercial deployment of more-efficient technologies and sustainable alternative fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|title=Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise Program|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000308/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|archive-date=2011-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first five-year agreement with manufacturers produced jet engine, wing, and aerodynamic technologies; automation and flight management systems; fuels; and materials from 2010\u20132015.

In 2016, the United States and 22 countries reached an agreement on a first-ever global aircraft carbon dioxide standard to encourage more fuel-efficient technologies to be integrated into aircraft designs. Also in 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended a new environmental measure of non-volatile particulate matter emissions. It replaces the 1970s-era \u201csmoke number\u201d \u2014 a figure that describes the visibility of emissions \u2014 with a much more accurate measure of emissions particles.\n\n=== Safety ===\nThe FAA's safety program is guided by its [[Safety management systems|Safety Management System]] <nowiki/>\u2014 an agency-wide approach that directs the management of NextGen initiatives. NextGen capabilities\u2019 benefits must maintain safe operations in the National Airspace System (NAS), and the FAA has many processes to ensure that flying remains safe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|title=NextGen portfolio System Safety Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502095913/https://www.faa.gov/NextGen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Safety|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155111/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|archive-date=2015-03-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe interconnected nature of NextGen presents complicated safety challenges that call for an integrated approach to safety [[risk management]]<nowiki/>. Integrated safety risk management explores safety risk from a NAS enterprise framework to identify potential safety gaps inherent in NextGen capabilities. It identifies safety issues by assessing risk across organizational, system, and program boundaries, and relies on FAA-wide collaboration to capture the most relevant safety information to assist in decision-making.\n\nAviation watchdogs once measured safety by the number of accidents. Commercial aviation accidents eventually became so rare that the FAA began to measure potential precursors to accidents. Loss of a safe margin of separation between aircraft became the risk measure that the FAA tracked and reported. Proximity is a valid indicator, but is an incomplete picture and provides no insight into accidents\u2019 causal factors. System Safety Management is a NextGen portfolio of initiatives to develop and implement policies, processes, and analytical tools that the FAA and industry will use to ensure the safety of the NAS. The goal is to be certain that changes introduced with NextGen capabilities maintain or enhance safety while delivering capacity and efficiency benefits to NAS users.\n\nImproved risk analysis processes and new safety intelligence tools help safety analysts go beyond examining past accident data to detecting risk and implementing mitigation strategies for accident prevention.

To achieve the full benefits of trajectory-based operations, users must equip with the required avionics, including Performance Based Navigation, Data Comm, and ADS-B In, and industry agrees on the value of equipping despite the difficulties.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2016/06/02/nac-updates-on-latest-benefits-challenges-for-nextgen-program/|title=NAC Updates on Latest Benefits, Challenges for NextGen Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Training ===\nImplementing trajectory-based operations will require cultural changes among air traffic controllers and industry. Training and other human factors changes will be necessary for air traffic controllers, pilots, traffic flow managers, and dispatchers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lasvegassun.com/news/2017/may/22/air-traffic-control-system-desperately-needs-updat/|title=Air traffic control system desperately needs update, not upheaval|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Industry will need to work closely with the FAA as the agency moves to this new model. To maximize throughput, airlines and others have to agree that throughput and predictability are the primary metrics the FAA will use to judge the system's effectiveness. This could be different from, or even in some cases counter to, the traditional flight efficiency metrics used by airlines including reduced delay, reduced track miles, and reduced fuel burn.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/CNOReport2017.pdf|title=2017 Chief NextGen Officer report}}</ref>\n\n=== Operational integration ===\nOperational integration of all air-ground capabilities is needed to achieve the full benefits of NextGen. Due to the integrated nature of NextGen, many of its component systems are mutually dependent on one or more other systems. The FAA implements systems through segments that the stakeholder community agrees are useful and that balance costs and benefits. The FAA will have delivered initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide all anticipated NextGen benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=|title=Story of NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/CNOReport2017.pdf|title=2017 Chief NextGen Officer report}}</ref>\n\n=== New entrants ===\nThe demand for access to airspace by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and commercial spacecraft is evolving, and the FAA must accommodate changing needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/americas-plan-somehow-make-drones-not-ruin-skies/|title=America's Plan to Somehow Make Drones Not Ruin the Skies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA is pursuing ways to safely and efficiently integrate these new entrants into the National Airspace System (NAS) with minimal impact on other NAS users. This involves determining the required automation support, as well as the surveillance, communication, and navigation capabilities that account for the unique performance characteristics of UAS, and space launch and re-entry vehicles. Many NextGen technologies are expected to facilitate this integration.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== Environmental impacts ===\nCommunities around airports are concerned about increased environmental problems, particularly noise. Nextgen has created a \"rail\" of flights, or a concentrated path of flights, in cities across the United States, and residents living under the \"rail\" are hearing more aircraft noise. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@bcastleton/nextgen-and-noise-pollution-the-faas-carte-blanche-to-send-planes-screaming-over-our-houses-dad4f3d4d29d|title=NextGen Nextgen and Noise Pollution the FAAs Carte Blanche to Send Planes Screaming Over Our Houses|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818142440/https://medium.com/@bcastleton/nextgen-and-noise-pollution-the-faas-carte-blanche-to-send-planes-screaming-over-our-houses-dad4f3d4d29d|archive-date=2019-08-18|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> Congress set up a coalition to study the noise issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nqsc.org/Organizations.html|title=National Quiet Skies Coalition|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190818145007/https://nqsc.org/Organizations.html|archive-date=2019-08-18|url-status=dead|access-date=2019-08-18}}</ref> A [[Government Accountability Office]] report on environmental impacts at airports indicated that the changes in flight paths that will accompany NextGen efforts would affect some communities that were previously unaffected or minimally affected by aircraft noise and expose them to increased noise levels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-10-50|title=Aviation and the Environment: Systematically Addressing Environmental Impacts and Community Concerns Can Help Airports Reduce Project Delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> These levels could trigger the need for environmental reviews, as well as raise community concerns. The report found that addressing environmental impacts can delay the implementation of operational changes, and indicated that a systematic approach to addressing these impacts and the resulting community concerns may help reduce such delays. \n\nThrough its environment and energy strategy, the FAA is maturing new aircraft technologies, removing the barriers to sustainable alternative jet fuels, developing new operational procedures, advancing analytical capabilities, and implementing policies, standards, and measures to reduce noise and emissions, and improve energy efficiency.\n\nRegarding noise, the FAA has renewed its focus to provide information to the community and solicit aviation user and citizen input when developing procedures. This helps the FAA ensure that proposed airspace and route adjustments consider aviation system safety and efficiency as well as community impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-aviation-faa-noise-idUKKBN0NT1VQ20150508|title=FAA plans major study of U.S. airport noise|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110122305/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|archive-date=2012-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThe FAA has traditionally followed the National Environmental Protection Act process when designing and implementing procedures. However, in recent years, more community involvement is necessary, especially when flight paths are being changed due to Performance Based Navigation implementations. The FAA has increased its public engagement efforts to educate communities about how the agency develops procedures and measures noise, and to listen to residents\u2019 concerns. The FAA has been working closely with airports, airlines, and community officials to determine how the agency can best balance the FAA's pursuit of safer, more efficient flight paths with the needs of nearby communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|title=ATCA Conference Keynote Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101231905/http://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|archive-date=2016-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> This new approach to community involvement does not guarantee outcomes that satisfy everyone.

Significant work remains to deploy new Performance Based Navigation (PBN) procedures to capture airspace efficiencies and boost arrival rates, develop surface technologies to enhance capacity on crowded runways and taxiways, and install Data Comm in high-altitude airspace.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fcw.com/articles/2017/05/22/faa-hearing-gunter.aspx|title=GOP continues push to privatize air traffic control|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/6/5/15740810/trump-air-traffic-control-privatization|title=Why Trump's plan to privatize air traffic control could end up costing more|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nTo continue progress toward major program milestones, the FAA will need to resolve key risk areas that will materially affect the delivery, capabilities, and benefits of modernization priorities. Recognizing these risks with its priority areas, the FAA adjusted its plans and established a three-year rolling implementation plan that will be updated at the beginning of each fiscal year to focus on high-benefit, high-readiness capabilities. The FAA and industry have also agreed on ways to increase communication on these issues.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/35697|title=Observations on FAA\u2019s Efforts To Implement Reforms and Modernize the National Airspace System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Communication ===\nAnother concern is that the FAA's business case does not communicate the range of uncertainty or complex factors associated with NextGen implementation to Congress, aviation stakeholders, or the traveling public, which limits the agency's ability to set realistic expectations for NextGen benefits. The FAA is continuing to work with industry to assess potential benefits from NextGen technologies and the steps required to realize them.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oig.dot.gov/sites/default/files/FAA%20NexGen%20Business%20Case%20Letter%5E8-15-17.pdf|title=U.S. Department of Transportation letter to Rep.

Dixon, principal assistant inspector general for auditing and evaluation, the FAA's major acquisitions since the creation of the [[Air Traffic Organization]] continue to experience performance issues. Six programs experienced cost increases totaling $692 million and schedule delays averaging 25 months. The FAA's implementation of this approach has led to unclear and inconsistent reporting on overall program costs, schedules, and benefits. Notwithstanding reforms, several underlying and systemic issues \u2014 including overambitious plans, shifting requirements, software development problems, ineffective contract and program management, and unreliable cost and schedule estimates \u2014 affect the FAA's ability to introduce new technologies and capabilities that are critical to transitioning to NextGen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reason.org/news/show/1014429.html/|title=Inspector General Report Shows FAA Is Failing and Why a Non-Profit Should Manage Air Traffic Control|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.oig.dot.gov/library-item/32908|title=FAA Reforms Have Not Achieved Expected Cost, Efficiency, and Modernization Outcomes|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nDuring a meeting with air carrier CEOs shortly after taking office, [[Donald Trump|President Donald Trump]] claimed that the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] spent more than $7 billion to upgrade the system and \u201ctotally failed.\u201d However, FAA Administrator Michael Huerta said in a speech that NextGen has already provided $2.7 billion in benefits, and is on track to provide more than $157 billion more by 2030.

The National Research Council's 2015 \u201cReview of the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d report explains that NextGen needs an explicit system architecture \u2014 in addition to its existing enterprise architecture  \u2014 to guide its development, manage risk, and cope with change. To create this architecture, FAA should build an architecture community and also strengthen its work force in several technical fields. The report also examines the incorporation of cybersecurity, unmanned aircraft systems, and human factors into the NextGen architecture. Finally, the report considers NextGen's anticipated costs and benefits, noting that airlines are not motivated to spend money on NextGen because they receive few direct benefits and face schedule uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=21721|title=FAA Should 'Reset Expectations' for Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Noise ===\nMore precise PBN can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jdasolutions.aero/blog/nextgen-noise-study/|title=NextGen Noise: RNP\u2019s concentrated IMPACT may justify substantive change in FAA policies under a proper study|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|title=FAA facing backlash over noise issues created by PBN flight paths|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021124915/http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|archive-date=2016-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/advances-in-airport-technology-mean-sleepless-nights-for-some/2016/03/04/7b8eb936-e098-11e5-9c36-e1902f6b6571_story.html|title=Advances in airport technology mean sleepless nights for some|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aireform.com/a-closer-look-at-how-faa-is-tone-deaf-on-nextgen-noise-impacts/|title=A Closer Look at How FAA is \u2018Tone-Deaf\u2019 on NextGen Noise Impacts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospectparkquietskies.org/Maurice_Implications_Enviro_NextGen.pdf|title=Implications of Administration Environmental Requirements for NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A feature of the NextGen program is GPS-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes.

The US [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) began work on NextGen improvements in 2007 and plans to have all major components in place by 2025.<ref>[https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf 2016 Update to The Business Case for the Next Generation Air Transportation System] based on the Future of the NAS Report</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe goals of the modernization include using new technologies and procedures to increase the safety, efficiency, capacity, access, flexibility, predictability, and resilience of the NAS while reducing the [[environmental impact of aviation]].\n\n== History ==\nThe need for NextGen became apparent during the summer of 2000 when air travel was impeded by severe congestion and costly delays. Two years later, the Commission on the Future of the U.S. Aerospace Industry recommended that a multi-agency task force develop an integrated plan to transform the U.S. air transportation system. In 2003, Congress enacted the Vision 100 \u2013 Century of Aviation Reauthorization Act, which established the [[Joint Planning and Development Office]] (JPDO) to create a unified vision of what the U.S. air transportation system should deliver for the next generation and beyond, to develop and coordinate long-term research plans, and to sponsor cross-agency mission research.\n\nThe result of the JPDO's efforts was the creation of the \u201cIntegrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d in 2004,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tg.hfes.org/astg/papers/Natl_Plan_NGATS_v5.pdf|title=Integrated National Plan for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which defined high-level goals, objectives, and requirements to transform the air transportation system. In addition to the Department of Transportation and FAA, the plan involved other government agencies with responsibilities in air transportation services, including the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), [[National Weather Service]], [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]], and [[Transportation Security Administration]].\n\nThe JPDO released the \u201cConcept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|title=Concept of Operations for the Next Generation Air Transportation System|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151012213821/http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a535795.pdf|archive-date=2015-10-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> to the aviation stakeholder community in 2007. The concept of operations provided the overview of NextGen goals for 2025. Growth of the NextGen concept was an evolutionary, step-by-step process, and the JPDO document continued to be updated through 2011. The same year, the FAA published the first version of its expanded Operational Evolution Partnership,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nextor.org/Conferences/200709_NAS_Performance/0905_2b_Swennson%20-%20OEP.pdf|title=Operational Evolution Partnership|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> which outlined the agency's path to NextGen through 2025.\n\nThe original integrated national plan included airport surface and passenger terminal operations and was known as a \u201ccurb-to-curb\u201d solution. The concept of operations was intended to drive cross-agency research to validate the concepts and to eliminate ideas and alternatives that were not operationally feasible or beneficial. The FAA focused on the pieces of the air transportation system for which it was responsible \u2013 the \u201cgate-to-gate\u201d components. In 2011, the FAA published the report \u201cNextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations for the National Airspace System\u201d. The FAA concept of operations was consistent with the JPDO's broad set of objectives, including maintaining safety and security, increasing capacity and efficiency, ensuring access to airspace and airports, and mitigating environmental impacts. The report identified several key transformational concepts as necessary to achieve NextGen goals and objectives, such as precision navigation and network-enabled information access, and the FAA has made progress on them.\n\nChanges were underway in 2008 when the FAA started to move key parts of NextGen, such as [[Automatic dependent surveillance \u2013 broadcast|Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast]] (ADS-B), from design to delivery. NextGen progress involved expanded research and development capability, participation by the aviation industry and international partners, and support by the White House and Congress (which are highlighted in this section).\n\nThe agency established a research and development facility, known as a testbed, at [[Embry\u2013Riddle Aeronautical University|Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]], Florida, in 2008. In 2010, the FAA dedicated another testbed, the NextGen Integration and Evaluation Capability Laboratory at the [[William J. Hughes Technical Center]] in Atlantic City, New Jersey, for researchers to simulate and evaluate the effects of NextGen components on the NAS. The lab's capability grew in 2013 with a contract awarded to [[General Dynamics]] to provide engineering, software design and development, infrastructure, and administrative support.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.generaldynamics.com/news/press-releases/2013/03/general-dynamics-awarded-12-million-support-federal-aviation|title=General Dynamics Awarded $12 Million to Support Federal Aviation Administration System Engineering 2020 Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2008, the FAA signed agreements with [[Honeywell]] and ACSS to accelerate testing and installation of NextGen technology to detect and alert pilots of safety hazards on the airport surface.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2008/11/03/faa-signs-contract-with-honeywell-acss/|title=FAA Signs Contract with Honeywell, ACSS|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> [[NetJets]] also agreed to equip part of its fleet to test some programs in various areas of the United States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.netjets.com/News/2015/faa-partners-with-netjets-on-implementing-nextgen-technologies--/|title=FAA Partners With NetJets on Implementing NextGen Technologies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> By 2010, the FAA awarded [[Computer Support Services]] Inc. a $280 million contract to perform engineering work for NextGen, the first of six contracts that would be awarded under an umbrella portfolio contract. [[Boeing]], [[General Dynamics]], and [[ITT Inc.|ITT Corp.]] received FAA contracts worth up to $4.4 billion to conduct large-scale demonstrations to see how NextGen concepts, procedures, and technologies could be integrated into the current NAS. In 2012, the FAA selected [[Harris Corporation|Harris Corp.]], which then subcontracted [[Dataprobe]], to develop the [[National Airspace System Voice Switch|NAS Voice System]] and manage a $331 million Data Communications Integrated Services contract.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/09/harris-corporation-awarded-331-million-contract-by-faa-for-data/|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $331 Million Contract by FAA for Data Communications Integrated Services Program|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.harris.com/press-releases/2012/08/harris-corporation-awarded-291-million-contract-to-provide-federal-aviation|title=Harris Corporation Awarded $291 Million Contract to Provide Federal Aviation Administration's New National Air Traffic Control Communications System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCommercial airlines also became involved in NextGen. In 2011, the FAA signed an agreement with [[JetBlue]] to allow the carrier to fly select flights equipped with ADS-B, opening the airline to improved routing and giving the FAA NextGen data through real-time operational evaluations. [[United Airlines]] in 2013 announced plans to become the first carrier to equip a portion of its fleet with avionics necessary for [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] (Data Comm) under the FAA NextGen Data Comm avionics equipage program. The program was funded to equip 1,900 aircraft across the industry to ensure enough aircraft would participate in Data Comm.\n\nTo develop industry consensus for the FAA's midterm goals, the agency established a new task force carried out through [[RTCA, Incorporated|RTCA]] in 2009.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|title=NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force Report Sept. 9, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812102308/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/nextgen_progress_report.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-12|url-status=dead}}</ref> The FAA wanted the task force to examine how industry could contribute to and benefit from the NextGen effort; accordingly, the agency released a plan in 2010 on how to implement recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|title=FAA Response to Recommendations of the RTCA NextGen Mid-Term Implementation Task Force|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110824192936/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/FAA_TASKFORCE_RESPONSE_1-31-2010.pdf|archive-date=2011-08-24|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe NextGen Advisory Committee (NAC),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>  established in 2010 to address the task force recommendation to continue industry collaboration, is a federal advisory group comprising aviation stakeholders formed to provide advice on policy-level NextGen implementation issues facing the aviation community. The FAA and NAC in 2014 agreed on the NextGen Priorities Joint Implementation Plan to accelerate delivery of four core NextGen initiatives over three years to improve efficiency: optimizing airports with multiple runways (e.g. via simultaneous parallel landings with reduced separation), increasing the efficiency of surface operations, reconfiguring the navigation system from ground-based to primarily satellite-based, and improving communications between aircraft and the ground through a digital system.\n\nThe FAA seeks to ensure international [[air traffic management]] interoperability and system harmonization for improved safety and efficiency. In 2010, the FAA and the European Commission agreed to cooperate in 22 areas to help in joint research and development of NextGen and [[Single European Sky ATM Research]] (SESAR) projects. By 2012, the FAA and the A6 alliance of European air navigation service providers agreed to work toward an interoperable aviation system, and work together to deploy and implement NextGen and SESAR.\n\nExecutive Order 13479, Transformation of the National Air Transportation System,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=84969|title=Executive Order 13479\u2014Transformation of the National Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> signed in 2008 mandated the Secretary of Transportation to establish a NextGen support staff. The FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/plans_reports/modernization/|title=FAA Modernization and Reform Act (P.L. 112-095) Reports and Plans|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140811143229/http://www.faa.gov/about/plans_reports/modernization/|archive-date=2014-08-11|url-status=dead}}</ref> included establishing deadlines for adopting existing NextGen navigation and surveillance technology and mandated development of precision navigational procedures at the nation's 35 busiest airports by 2015.\n\nIn 2010, the FAA's Aviation Safety organization released a work plan that identified how the safety staff would set NextGen standards and oversee safe implementation of new technologies, processes, and procedures. The FAA also issued a final rule mandating NextGen performance requirements for aircraft surveillance equipment. It requires aircraft operating in most controlled U.S. airspace to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020.\n\n==Justification==\nA Department of Transportation 30-year outlook report published in 2016, \u201cBeyond Traffic: Trends and Choices 2045,\u201d <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.transportation.gov/policy-initiatives/beyond-traffic-2045-final-report|title=Beyond Traffic: 2045 Final Report|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> estimated flight delays and congestion cost the U.S. economy more than $20 billion each year.

The agency worked with industry to identify capabilities taking advantage of existing aircraft equipage.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rtca.org/content/nextgen-advisory-committee|title=RTCA NextGen Advisory Committee|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> This strategy enabled airspace users to realize early benefits while keeping NextGen on course to achieve its long-term goal of time-based air traffic management.\n\nNext, the FAA started replacing its foundational infrastructure. Based on previous lessons learned, the agency determined the best way to upgrade its services was to begin with a new infrastructure that could accommodate state-of-the-art enabling technologies and advanced capabilities rather than adding one-off improvements to an aging infrastructure that couldn't accommodate broader transformation.\n\nFAA modernization programs, such as [[ERAM|En Route Automation Modernization]] (ERAM) and [[Standard Terminal Automation Replacement System|Terminal Automation Modernization and Replacement]] (TAMR), are foundational pieces upon which the FAA could build the NextGen vision. These programs support NextGen objectives with modern software architectures that serve as the platform for new capabilities for air traffic controllers and managers.\n\nThe FAA uses a widely accepted model for building large-scale automation systems. Program lifecycles are continuous with a planned schedule of technology refreshes. For example, the FAA finished installing the original hardware for ERAM in 2008, and completed software and program acceptance in 2015. In 2016, the agency updated the technology of all major system components that were becoming obsolete. This is a common approach to maintain the latest level of technology.\n\nOn top of the foundational systems, the FAA then identified key enabling systems that improve communication, information sharing, navigation, surveillance, traffic flow optimization, and weather systems.\n\nChanges to the national airspace necessary to implement these individual concepts yield additional benefits. Integrating these systems is anticipated to transform the air traffic management system in an effort to keep pace with the growing needs of an increasingly diverse mix of air transportation system users without sacrificing safety.\n\nIntegration is necessary to achieve an FAA long-term goal of trajectory-based operations (TBO). TBO is a method of strategically planning and managing air traffic from airport to airport for optimal performance by using the aircraft's ability to fly precise paths; metering traffic flow using time instead of distance; and sharing information between pilots, flight dispatchers, and controllers and managers.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ang/offices/tc/library/Storyboard/tbo.html#welcome|title=TBO Vision 2025 Storyboard|date=October 4, 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith TBO, the FAA and operators will be able to tell with a great deal of accuracy where aircraft will be at any point in time along the way to its destination. This will provide improved knowledge of the estimated departure and arrival time at each navigational waypoint along the entire route of flight. These times will be shared between air and ground automation systems and used to improve assessments of how to balance demand and capacity, and minimize the impact of disruptions due to weather, or system or facility outages. NextGen benefits extend to all phases of flight operations.\n\nBecause NextGen is a complex, large-scale system of systems implemented over more than 18 years, its development and implementation can be difficult to follow. Systems are always in various stages of lifecycle management from research and development to technical refreshes. FAA planning reports are used to map the evolution from the legacy National Airspace System (NAS) to NextGen. To manage NextGen with short-term funding horizons, the FAA rolled out improvements in smaller increments with more program segments to ensure affordability.\n\nThe FAA has scheduled initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide the complete set of anticipated NextGen benefits. Beyond 2025, the FAA expects to accrue benefits through enterprise-level advanced applications, additional aircraft equipage, and full workforce adoption of a time-based air traffic management system.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is using knowledge gained since 2011 when it published the NextGen Mid-Term Concept of Operations. Working closely with stakeholders, the FAA invested in research and pre-implementation work to determine the feasibility of advanced concepts and their associated benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref> The aviation community understood that many, but not all, of the concepts would produce positive business cases once research and pre-implementation work was under way, and that some goals would be replaced by other concepts in an evolving aviation environment.

The FAA is making progress in transforming the NAS.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-10-24/faa-declares-steady-progress-nextgen-atc-modernization|title=FAA Declares Steady Progress on NextGen ATC Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2017-02-15/faas-nextgen-making-progress-airline-pilots-union-asserts|title=FAA's NextGen Making Progress, Airline Pilots Union Asserts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2017/03/02/faa-ready-review-us-air-traffic-modernization/|title=FAA Ready to Review US Air Traffic Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/2015/10/23/datacomm-eram-ads-b-huerta-touts-nextgen-milestones/|title=DataComm, ERAM, ADS-B: Huerta Touts NextGen Milestones|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nSix concepts that posed too high a technical risk, for instance those with no available technical solution, have been deferred beyond 2030. Some concepts that required more research to garner evidence of perceived operational benefits also have been deferred for implementation into the later segments of NextGen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|title=Future of the NAS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161221003424/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/futureOfTheNAS.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Elements==\nNextGen is generally described as a shift from a ground-based system of air traffic control to a satellite-based system of air traffic management. It is not one technology, product, or goal. Rather, it encompasses many technologies, policies, and procedures, and changes are implemented after thorough safety testing. It is composed of many elements that provide benefits individually and collectively to transform the air transportation system.\n\n=== Communication ===\nController Pilot Data Link Communications, also known as [[Next Generation Data Communications|Data Communications]] or just Data Comm, uses typed digital messages to supplement voice communications between air traffic controllers and pilots. The first part of the program for 55 airports, tower departure clearance services, finished in 2016 more than two years ahead of schedule. It is helping equipped aircraft take off sooner through messages quickly exchanged and clearly understood.\n\nUnlike voice messages, Data Comm messages sent by controllers are delivered only to the intended aircraft, which eliminates the chance of another pilot acting on instructions for another aircraft with a similar call sign. It avoids the chance of misunderstood messages because of busy radio chatter or variations in the way people speak, and it can be a backup if a microphone malfunctions. It also preserves radio bandwidth when voice communication is necessary or preferred.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aviationtoday.com/av/issue/cover/88451.html?hq_e=el&hq_m=3280857&hq_l=2&hq_v=702ed8c35e|title=NextGen Data Comm Facilitates Digital DCL|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nUsing Data Comm, tower air traffic controllers can send pilots of equipped aircraft departure clearance instructions to read, accept, and load into their flight management system with the push of a button. Messages also are sent to [[flight dispatcher]]s, giving everyone a shared awareness for faster reactions to changing circumstances, such as approaching thunderstorms.\n\nData Comm saves aircraft time waiting to take off, particularly when routes change, which reduces fuel use and engine exhaust emissions. It lowers the chances of delays or cancellations when weather affects the flight route. Pilots and controllers also can spend more time on other critical tasks, which enhances safety.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailybreeze.com/general-news/20160624/lax-unveils-data-comm-aircraft-texting-system-designed-to-reduce-flight-delays|title=LAX unveils Data Comm aircraft texting system designed to reduce flight delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kutv.com/news/local/new-data-comm-reduces-wait-time-on-slc-runways|title=New Data Comm system reduces wait time on SLC runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/37d10b72c9b8402099c602afc0391f44/Pilots,-air-traffic-controllers-shifting-to-text-messaging|title=Pilots, air traffic controllers shifting to text messaging|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119235508/https://www.apnews.com/37d10b72c9b8402099c602afc0391f44/Pilots,-air-traffic-controllers-shifting-to-text-messaging|archive-date=2018-01-19|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/ct-ohare-pilot-texting-0930-biz-20160929-story.html|title=Pilots to start texting at O'Hare, Midway \u2014 but it's not what you think|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/faa-shows-off-new-air-traffic-communications-at-msp/419214164/|title=\"FAA shows off new air-traffic communications at Minneapolis-St. Paul Airport\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.amny.com/transit/nyc-flights-benefiting-from-new-text-based-tech-faa-says-1.13276922|title=NYC flights benefiting from new text-based tech, FAA says|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/pilot-text-messages-are-saving-you-from-flight-delays/|title=Pilot text messages are saving you from flight delays|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/air-transport/2016-09-28/faa-accelerates-data-communications-roll-out-atc-towers|title=FAA Accelerates Data Communications Roll Out to ATC Towers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2016/09/27/airlines-flight-controllers-data-communications/91177576/|title=Less chat, more action for airlines, flight controllers|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://crankyflier.com/2016/06/28/a-demo-on-how-data-comm-is-going-to-make-flying-better/|title=A Demo On How Data Comm Is Going to Make Flying Better|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/new-direct-digital-link-between-tower-and-cockpit-will-speed-planes-on-their-way/2016/09/27/50eb9ec8-843b-11e6-a3ef-f35afb41797f_story.html|title=New direct digital link between tower and cockpit will speed planes on their way|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nBased on Data Comm's success, air carriers requested and the FAA approved in 2017 seven more airports to receive tower services to be completed by 2019.

Performance standards for certain airspace are conveyed to pilots through navigation specifications published by the FAA that identify the aircraft avionics and choice of ground- or satellite-based navigation aids that may be used to meet performance requirements.\n\nPBN comprises [[area navigation]] (RNAV) and [[required navigation performance]] (RNP). With RNAV, equipped aircraft fly any desired path within the coverage of ground- or space-based navigation aids, within the capability of aircraft equipage, or both. RNP is an advanced form of RNAV. Aircraft must be equipped to monitor onboard navigation performance and alert pilots trained to use it if a requirement is unmet during an operation. Aircraft can operate safely near mountainous terrain or in congested airspace by using RNP procedures.\n\nPBN primarily uses satellite-enabled technology and creates precise, repeatable, and predictable 3-D flight paths free from the constraints previously imposed by the physical locations of ground-based navigation infrastructure. A new route structure makes straighter paths possible for greater efficiency, and more routes can fit into the same airspace, which increases capacity. From 2009\u20132016, PBN procedures available nearly tripled at airports across the nation. As of December 2019, the FAA has published more than 9,600 PBN procedures and routes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/flight_info/aeronav/procedures/ifp_inventory_summary/|title=Instrument Flight Procedures (IFP) Inventory Summary|last=|first=|date=December 11, 2019|website=Federal Aviation Administration|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These consist of RNAV [[standard instrument departure]]s, T-Routes (1,200 feet above the surface to 18,000 feet of altitude), Q-Routes (18,000\u201345,000 feet of altitude), RNAV [[Standard terminal arrival route|standard terminal arrivals]] (STAR), RNAV (GPS) approaches, and RNP approaches.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Performance Based Navigation|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313085529/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/pbn/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref> Of the airports that publish [[instrument approach]] procedures, 96 percent publish PBN approach procedures and 31 percent use only PBN approach procedures.\n\nRNAV STAR procedures can provide a [[continuous descent approach]] also known as an optimized profile descent from cruising altitude to save fuel and reduce emissions and noise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2014/06/houston-nextgen-plane-descents/|title=Planes Are Finally Making Logical Descents Onto American Runways|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA has published many RNAV STAR procedures with this capability that enable aircraft to fly closer to the airport at a more fuel-efficient altitude before descending, which also saves fuel by eliminating level-offs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|title=New Analysis Shows Big Benefits at Minneapolis International Airport|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170628094052/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=62|archive-date=2017-06-28|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|title=Changes to Houston\u2019s Airspace Bring Millions in Benefits to Local Airports|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201103647/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/stories/?slide=43|archive-date=2016-02-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> These procedures can be flown when available and when pilots are able to use them.\n\nUsing the [[Wide Area Augmentation System]]<nowiki/>, instrument-rated pilots now can land at airports where that was previously impossible using just [[Global Positioning System|GPS]]<nowiki/>.

Aircraft flying in most controlled airspace are required to be equipped for ADS-B Out by January 1, 2020. Instead of using ground-based radar to receive aircraft position, speed, and direction every five to 12 seconds, aircraft equipped with newer [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] transponders determine this information and then automatically send it out every second to air traffic control. ADS-B is always on and requires no operator intervention. It depends on an accurate satellite signal for position data, enhances surveillance services, and continuously broadcasts aircraft position and other data to ground stations and aircraft equipped to receive ADS-B. Pilots and air traffic controllers can for the first time see the same real-time display of air traffic, which substantially improves situational awareness for improved safety.\n\nThe FAA completed installation of new ground radio infrastructure in 2014, and coverage is available in all 50 states, Guam, Puerto Rico, the Gulf of Mexico, and area off both coasts. Integration of ADS-B into en route and terminal automation platforms was completed in 2019.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/updates/?newsId=94678|title=FAA Successfully Completes Final ADS-B Milestone|last=|first=|date=October 7, 2019|work=FAA News and Updates|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe FAA is evaluating space-based ADS-B surveillance services for oceanic airspace as part of a project called Advanced Surveillance Enhanced Procedural Separation.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://aviationweek.com/air-transport/faa-takes-steps-toward-space-based-ads-b-track-aircraft|title=FAA Takes Steps Toward Space-Based ADS-B To Track Aircraft|last=|first=|date=December 12, 2019|work=Aviation Week|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> Moving from the current system of ADS-B ground stations to radios hosted on satellites offers the potential for reduced separation standards.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.satellitetoday.com/telecom/2017/04/27/faa-aireon-announce-space-based-ads-b-flight-test-success/|title=FAA and Aireon Announce Space-Based ADS-B Flight Test Success|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ainonline.com/aviation-news/business-aviation/2017-05-15/faa-nav-canada-and-aireon-test-space-based-ads-b|title=FAA, Nav Canada and Aireon Test Space-based ADS-B|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.getconnected.aero/2017/04/faa-aireon-next-gen-ads-b/|title=FAA and Aireon announce next-gen ADS-B test success|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> Even with the capabilities offered by ADS-B through satellite technology, surveillance radar is still relevant and will be used as a supplement and ultimately as backup to ADS-B in the event of service disruption.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/global-advance-ads-b|title=Global Advance Of ADS-B|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160926145530/http://aviationweek.com/connected-aerospace/global-advance-ads-b|archive-date=2016-09-26}}</ref>\n\n==== ADS-B Out ====\nWith ADS-B Out, surveillance coverage increases because ground stations can be provided in locations where obstructions or physical limitations don't allow radar.

For independent runways, aircraft can approach without having to maintain a staggered diagonal separation required by dependent operations. Further revisions to closely spaced parallel operations were included in the November 2015 update to [[FAA Order 7110.65]], Air Traffic Control<nowiki/>.\n\nThe new procedures reduce lateral separation requirements to as close as 3,900 feet for triple independent approaches, and 3,000 feet for offset dual independent approaches without requiring high-update-rate radar or Automatic Dependent Surveillance\u2013Broadcast. For dual dependent approaches, the runway spacing requirement remains 2,500 feet, but the diagonal spacing is reduced from 1.5 nautical mile (nm) to 1&nbsp;nm.\n\nFAA Order 7110.308C identifies specific airports \u2014 Boston, Cleveland, Memphis, Newark, Philadelphia, Seattle, San Francisco, and St. Louis \u2014 with runways spaced less than 2,500 feet apart that can reduce staggered spacing between aircraft on parallel approaches from 1.5&nbsp;nm to 1&nbsp;nm.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/working_together/airports/|title=NextGen Airports|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180518055951/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/working_together/airports/|archive-date=2018-05-18|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Converging Runway Display Aid is an automation tool used by air traffic controllers to manage the sequence of arrival flows on converging or intersecting runways.

They help to achieve NextGen goals of safely increasing access, efficiency, and throughput at many airports when low visibility is the limiting factor. [[Head-up display]]s (HUD) <nowiki/>were approved to use on a precision approach to lower minimum decision heights to land. Use of a qualified HUD when flying to a suitable [[Instrument landing system|Instrument Landing System]]<nowiki/> facility will reduce the required runway visual range visibility for approach.\n\nThe FAA allows the use of an [[enhanced flight vision system]] (EFVS)<nowiki/> instead of natural vision to conduct an instrument landing procedure in low-visibility conditions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/new-faa-rules-let-technology-replace-natural-vision|title=New FAA Rules Let Technology Replace Natural Vision|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170111151324/http://aviationweek.com/commercial-aviation/new-faa-rules-let-technology-replace-natural-vision|archive-date=2017-01-11|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.avweb.com/avwebflash/news/FAA-Expands-Enhanced-Vision-Capabilities-228201-1.html|title=FAA Expands Enhanced Vision Capabilities|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> EFVS uses sensor technologies to provide a clear, real-time virtual image to the pilot of the view outside the aircraft, regardless of the cloud cover and visibility conditions. Pilots can identify required visual references that would be impossible without it. It provides access that otherwise would be denied because of low visibility. A [[Synthetic vision system|synthetic vision guidance system]]<nowiki/> combines flight guidance display technology with high-precision position assurance monitors to provide a continuous and correct depiction of the external scene and runway. It can assist a pilot's transition to natural vision references. A project also is under way to enable taxiing at airports in low-visibility conditions.\n\nAnother NextGen project is the Ground Based Augmentation System Landing System (GBAS). It uses GPS to support all precision-approach categories.

These arrivals are planned, fixed routes for aircraft approaching these airports from oceanic airspace that are communicated via a data link from the air traffic controller. They limit vectoring and minimize the time the aircraft spends maintaining level flight during descent, which reduces fuel consumption, aircraft exhaust emissions, and time in flight.

The FAA Office of Environment and Energy Research and Development is working to reduce air and water pollution, carbon dioxide emissions that may affect climate, and noise that can disturb residents near airports. Aircraft airframe and engine technology, alternative fuels, air traffic management modernization and operational improvements, improved scientific knowledge and integrated modeling, and policies, environmental standards, and market-based measures will contribute toward meeting almost all of these goals. Noise and emissions will be the main environmental problems on National Airspace System capacity and flexibility unless they are effectively managed and mitigated. \n\nSince the late 1970s, the number of people exposed to significant aircraft noise dropped by more than 95 percent while operations more than doubled. Even with this decrease, community concern regarding aircraft noise is climbing. The FAA aims to minimize the impact of noise on residential areas without compromising safety. The agency's goal is to reduce the number of people around airports exposed to a day-night average aircraft sound level of 65 decibels to less than 300,000 by 2018. One way the agency plans to achieve that is by adopting a new noise standard for certain newly certificated subsonic jet airplanes and subsonic transport category large airplanes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|title=NextGen Update: 2017 Environment and Energy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150313094224/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/environment/|archive-date=2015-03-13|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nA survey, the largest of its kind, about aircraft noise exposure and its effects on communities around airports was completed in 2016. The FAA will use those results and other research under way to re-evaluate criteria to define significance under the [[National Environmental Policy Act]]<nowiki/> and federal land use guidelines. In addition, the FAA is conducting research in other impact areas, such as sleep disturbance, cardiovascular health, and children's learning. The FAA also is examining the potential noise impacts of new entrants, such as unmanned aircraft systems, civil supersonic aircraft, and commercial space vehicles.\n\nThe Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise (CLEEN) program is a public-private partnership under NextGen to accelerate development and commercial deployment of more-efficient technologies and sustainable alternative fuels.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|title=Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions, and Noise Program|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111101000308/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/research/aircraft_technology/cleen/|archive-date=2011-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> The first five-year agreement with manufacturers produced jet engine, wing, and aerodynamic technologies; automation and flight management systems; fuels; and materials from 2010\u20132015.

In 2016, the United States and 22 countries reached an agreement on a first-ever global aircraft carbon dioxide standard to encourage more fuel-efficient technologies to be integrated into aircraft designs. Also in 2016, the ICAO Committee on Aviation Environmental Protection recommended a new environmental measure of non-volatile particulate matter emissions. It replaces the 1970s-era \u201csmoke number\u201d \u2014 a figure that describes the visibility of emissions \u2014 with a much more accurate measure of emissions particles.\n\n=== Safety ===\nThe FAA's safety program is guided by its [[Safety management systems|Safety Management System]] <nowiki/>\u2014 an agency-wide approach that directs the management of NextGen initiatives. NextGen capabilities\u2019 benefits must maintain safe operations in the National Airspace System (NAS), and the FAA has many processes to ensure that flying remains safe.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|title=NextGen portfolio System Safety Management|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170502095913/https://www.faa.gov/NextGen/snapshots/portfolios/?portfolioId=17|archive-date=2017-05-02|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|title=NextGen Update 2017 Safety|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150312155111/http://www.faa.gov/nextgen/update/progress_and_plans/safety/|archive-date=2015-03-12|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe interconnected nature of NextGen presents complicated safety challenges that call for an integrated approach to safety [[risk management]]<nowiki/>. Integrated safety risk management explores safety risk from a NAS enterprise framework to identify potential safety gaps inherent in NextGen capabilities. It identifies safety issues by assessing risk across organizational, system, and program boundaries, and relies on FAA-wide collaboration to capture the most relevant safety information to assist in decision-making.\n\nAviation watchdogs once measured safety by the number of accidents. Commercial aviation accidents eventually became so rare that the FAA began to measure potential precursors to accidents. Loss of a safe margin of separation between aircraft became the risk measure that the FAA tracked and reported. Proximity is a valid indicator, but is an incomplete picture and provides no insight into accidents\u2019 causal factors. System Safety Management is a NextGen portfolio of initiatives to develop and implement policies, processes, and analytical tools that the FAA and industry will use to ensure the safety of the NAS. The goal is to be certain that changes introduced with NextGen capabilities maintain or enhance safety while delivering capacity and efficiency benefits to NAS users.\n\nImproved risk analysis processes and new safety intelligence tools help safety analysts go beyond examining past accident data to detecting risk and implementing mitigation strategies for accident prevention.

In many cases, foundational systems are installed on aircraft as well as on the ground. The interoperability of air and ground systems, along with the need to synchronize equipage and other industry investments with FAA programs, has been a primary challenge to date. Standards, regulations, and procedures have to be developed. Program execution planning has to look at cost, schedule, and technical performance. Stakeholder buy-in in areas such as equipage and using new capabilities must be ongoing, and all involved \u2014 industry, federal agencies, government partners, and Congress \u2014 must be on the same path ahead.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/CNOReport2017.pdf|title=2017 Chief NextGen Officer report}}</ref>\n\n=== Funding ===\nIndustry and the FAA need to invest to make progress, and the FAA needs adequate and stable funding. Government shutdowns, furloughs, sequestration, and the lack of a long-term reauthorization make planning and executing modernization efforts more difficult.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21794|title=Collaboration Is Woven Into Our Fabric|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627232715/https://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21794|archive-date=2017-06-27|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=|first=|url=https://www.aviationtoday.com/2019/01/04/faa-shutdown-already-delaying-datacomm-transition-en-route-airspace/|title=FAA Shutdown Already Delaying Data Comm Transition to En Route Airspace|date=January 4, 2019|work=Avionics International|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref> The stop-and-go approach of the annual appropriations process hurts long-term planning.

Due to the integrated nature of NextGen, many of its component systems are mutually dependent on one or more other systems. The FAA implements systems through segments that the stakeholder community agrees are useful and that balance costs and benefits. The FAA will have delivered initial implementation of all major planned systems by 2025 but not the full integration necessary to provide all anticipated NextGen benefits.<ref>{{Cite web|url=|title=Story of NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/CNOReport2017.pdf|title=2017 Chief NextGen Officer report}}</ref>\n\n=== New entrants ===\nThe demand for access to airspace by unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) and commercial spacecraft is evolving, and the FAA must accommodate changing needs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2017/05/americas-plan-somehow-make-drones-not-ruin-skies/|title=America's Plan to Somehow Make Drones Not Ruin the Skies|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> The FAA is pursuing ways to safely and efficiently integrate these new entrants into the National Airspace System (NAS) with minimal impact on other NAS users. This involves determining the required automation support, as well as the surveillance, communication, and navigation capabilities that account for the unique performance characteristics of UAS, and space launch and re-entry vehicles.

The report found that addressing environmental impacts can delay the implementation of operational changes, and indicated that a systematic approach to addressing these impacts and the resulting community concerns may help reduce such delays. \n\nThrough its environment and energy strategy, the FAA is maturing new aircraft technologies, removing the barriers to sustainable alternative jet fuels, developing new operational procedures, advancing analytical capabilities, and implementing policies, standards, and measures to reduce noise and emissions, and improve energy efficiency.\n\nRegarding noise, the FAA has renewed its focus to provide information to the community and solicit aviation user and citizen input when developing procedures. This helps the FAA ensure that proposed airspace and route adjustments consider aviation system safety and efficiency as well as community impact.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/us-aviation-faa-noise-idUKKBN0NT1VQ20150508|title=FAA plans major study of U.S. airport noise|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|title=Aircraft Noise Issues|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120110122305/http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/apl/noise_emissions/airport_aircraft_noise_issues/|archive-date=2012-01-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> \n\nThe FAA has traditionally followed the National Environmental Protection Act process when designing and implementing procedures. However, in recent years, more community involvement is necessary, especially when flight paths are being changed due to Performance Based Navigation implementations. The FAA has increased its public engagement efforts to educate communities about how the agency develops procedures and measures noise, and to listen to residents\u2019 concerns. The FAA has been working closely with airports, airlines, and community officials to determine how the agency can best balance the FAA's pursuit of safer, more efficient flight paths with the needs of nearby communities.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|title=PBN NAS Navigation Strategy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220232615/https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/PBN_NAS_NAV.pdf|archive-date=2016-12-20|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|title=ATCA Conference Keynote Address|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161101231905/http://www.faa.gov/news/speeches/news_story.cfm?newsId=21014&omniRss=speechesAoc&cid=104_Speeches|archive-date=2016-11-01|url-status=dead}}</ref> This new approach to community involvement does not guarantee outcomes that satisfy everyone.

The National Research Council's 2015 \u201cReview of the Next Generation Air Transportation System\u201d report explains that NextGen needs an explicit system architecture \u2014 in addition to its existing enterprise architecture  \u2014 to guide its development, manage risk, and cope with change. To create this architecture, FAA should build an architecture community and also strengthen its work force in several technical fields. The report also examines the incorporation of cybersecurity, unmanned aircraft systems, and human factors into the NextGen architecture. Finally, the report considers NextGen's anticipated costs and benefits, noting that airlines are not motivated to spend money on NextGen because they receive few direct benefits and face schedule uncertainty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www8.nationalacademies.org/onpinews/newsitem.aspx?RecordID=21721|title=FAA Should 'Reset Expectations' for Next Generation Air Transportation System|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Noise ===\nMore precise PBN can reduce fuel burn, emissions, and noise exposure for a majority of communities, but the concentration of flight tracks also can increase noise exposure for people who live directly under those flight paths.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jdasolutions.aero/blog/nextgen-noise-study/|title=NextGen Noise: RNP\u2019s concentrated IMPACT may justify substantive change in FAA policies under a proper study|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|title=FAA facing backlash over noise issues created by PBN flight paths|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161021124915/http://atwonline.com/air-traffic-management/faa-facing-backlash-over-noise-issues-created-pbn-flight-paths|archive-date=2016-10-21|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/trafficandcommuting/advances-in-airport-technology-mean-sleepless-nights-for-some/2016/03/04/7b8eb936-e098-11e5-9c36-e1902f6b6571_story.html|title=Advances in airport technology mean sleepless nights for some|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://aireform.com/a-closer-look-at-how-faa-is-tone-deaf-on-nextgen-noise-impacts/|title=A Closer Look at How FAA is \u2018Tone-Deaf\u2019 on NextGen Noise Impacts|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.prospectparkquietskies.org/Maurice_Implications_Enviro_NextGen.pdf|title=Implications of Administration Environmental Requirements for NextGen|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A feature of the NextGen program is GPS-based waypoints, which result in consolidated flight paths for planes.

The letter said the FAA initially described NextGen as fundamentally transforming how air traffic would be managed. In 2015, however, the [[National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine|National Research Council]] noted that NextGen, as currently executed, was not broadly transformational and that it is a set of programs to implement a suite of incremental changes to the National Airspace System (NAS).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transportation.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2017-05-17_-_full_committee_ssm.pdf|title=Committee Hearing on \"The Need to Reform FAA and Air Traffic Control to Build a 21st Century Aviation System for America\"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://transportation.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=400893|title=Latest Inspector General Report Underscores Need for Air Traffic Control Reform|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nCriticism of NextGen has led to a renewed push to reform air traffic control, supported by the Trump Administration, that would move this function from the government to a not-for-profit, independent entity managed by a professional board of directors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/06/05/president-donald-j-trumps-principles-reforming-us-air-traffic-control|title=President Donald J.

On the way to her home, he learns that she has begun a relationship with Samir, the owner of a dry cleaning service and he is to share a room with Samir's son Fouad. At Marie's request, he speaks to her daughter from a previous marriage, Lucie, regarding her recent troubled behavior. Lucie disapproves of Marie's new relationship.\n\nAhmad and Marie attend court to complete their [[divorce]]. Just before the meeting with the officials, she tells him that she is pregnant with Samir's child. Ahmad continues to counsel Lucie, hoping to reconcile her to the situation. She reveals that Samir is still married and his wife is in coma after a suicide attempt, caused by the revelation that Samir and Marie were conducting an affair. Samir tells Ahmad that his wife suffered from depression and the [[suicide]] attempt was in fact caused by an incident with a customer in his shop. His wife was unaware of his affair and he arranges for Na\u00efma, his employee, who witnessed both the suicide attempt and the incident in the shop, to meet with Lucie.\n\nAfter hearing Na\u00efma's story, Lucie becomes distressed and confesses that she forwarded Marie's emails to Samir's wife the day before she tried to kill herself, after calling her at the dry cleaning shop. Lucie disappears and Ahmad and Samir search for her.  Ahmad finds Lucie, who has been staying with a friend, and tries to convince her to tell Marie what she did, saying that Marie has a right to know, now that she is carrying Samir's child. Lucie does so and Marie becomes enraged, telling Lucie to leave. Ahmad calms the situation and Lucie returns.\n\nAfter questioning what feelings he may still hold for his wife, Marie tells Samir what Lucie did. Samir finds this hard to accept and questions Na\u00efma about the events leading up his wife's suicide attempt. Na\u00efma states his wife wasn't even in the shop the day that Lucie said she called. After Marie accuses Lucie of lying, Lucie maintains her version of events saying that she spoke to a woman with an accent on the phone. Samir realizes that she actually spoke to Na\u00efma, who then gave Lucie his wife's email address. He confronts Na\u00efma, who confesses and explains that his wife had always been jealous of her and had been trying to get her either sacked or deported from France and had initiated the confrontation with the customer. However, Na\u00efma believes that his wife never read the emails, because she came into the shop and chose to drink bleach in front of her, instead of in front of Samir or Marie.\n\nSamir and Marie discuss the events and their relationship. Samir decides that they should focus on their future, while Marie appears conflicted. Ahmad prepares to return to Iran. He says farewell to the children and attempts to talk to Marie about the end of their marriage, but Marie does not let him, stating that she doesn't need to know such things now.

On the way to her home, he learns that she has begun a relationship with Samir, the owner of a dry cleaning service and he is to share a room with Samir's son Fouad. At Marie's request, he speaks to her daughter from a previous marriage, Lucie, regarding her recent troubled behavior. Lucie disapproves of Marie's new relationship.\n\nAhmad and Marie attend court to complete their [[divorce]]. Just before the meeting with the officials, she tells him that she is pregnant with Samir's child. Ahmad continues to counsel Lucie, hoping to reconcile her to the situation. She reveals that Samir is still married and his wife is in coma after a suicide attempt, caused by the revelation that Samir and Marie were conducting an affair. Samir tells Ahmad that his wife suffered from depression and the [[suicide]] attempt was in fact caused by an incident with a customer in his shop. His wife was unaware of his affair and he arranges for Na\u00efma, his employee, who witnessed both the suicide attempt and the incident in the shop, to meet with Lucie.\n\nAfter hearing Na\u00efma's story, Lucie becomes distressed and confesses that she forwarded Marie's emails to Samir's wife the day before she tried to kill herself, after calling her at the dry cleaning shop. Lucie disappears and Ahmad and Samir search for her.  Ahmad finds Lucie, who has been staying with a friend, and tries to convince her to tell Marie what she did, saying that Marie has a right to know, now that she is carrying Samir's child. Lucie does so and Marie becomes enraged, telling Lucie to leave. Ahmad calms the situation and Lucie returns.\n\nAfter questioning what feelings he may still hold for his wife, Marie tells Samir what Lucie did. Samir finds this hard to accept and questions Na\u00efma about the events leading up his wife's suicide attempt. Na\u00efma states his wife wasn't even in the shop the day that Lucie said she called. After Marie accuses Lucie of lying, Lucie maintains her version of events saying that she spoke to a woman with an accent on the phone. Samir realizes that she actually spoke to Na\u00efma, who then gave Lucie his wife's email address. He confronts Na\u00efma, who confesses and explains that his wife had always been jealous of her and had been trying to get her either sacked or deported from France and had initiated the confrontation with the customer. However, Na\u00efma believes that his wife never read the emails, because she came into the shop and chose to drink bleach in front of her, instead of in front of Samir or Marie.\n\nSamir and Marie discuss the events and their relationship. Samir decides that they should focus on their future, while Marie appears conflicted. Ahmad prepares to return to Iran. He says farewell to the children and attempts to talk to Marie about the end of their marriage, but Marie does not let him, stating that she doesn't need to know such things now. Meanwhile, Samir visits his wife in hospital with a selection of perfumes, which the doctors have recommended in order to possibly initiate a response. He sprays on some of his cologne and leans over her, asking her to squeeze his hand if she can smell it. A tear runs down her face and he looks down at her hand, which is holding his.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[B\u00e9r\u00e9nice Bejo]] as Marie Brisson<ref>{{cite news|title=B\u00e9r\u00e9nice too \u2026 Bejo to replace Marion Cotillard in new Asghar Farhadi film|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/aug/24/berenice-bejo-marion-cotillard-asghar-farhadi|accessdate=21 April 2013 |work= [[The Guardian]]|first=Ben|last=Child|date=24 August 2012}}</ref>\n* [[Tahar Rahim]] as Samir\n* [[Ali Mosaffa]] as Ahmad\n* [[Pauline Burlet]] as Lucie\n* Elyes Aguis as Fouad\n* Jeanne Jestin as L\u00e9a\n* [[Sabrina Ouazani]] as Na\u00efma\n* [[Babak Karimi]] as Shahryar\n* [[Valeria Cavalli]] as Valeria\n* Eleonora Marino as Marie's colleague\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Reception==\nThe film received universal critical acclaim.

{"title_page": "Payment", "text_new": "'''''Asiamanism'''''{{short description|Trade of value from one party to another for goods, services, or legal reasons}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{More citations needed|date=July 2007}}\n{{More footnotes|date=October 2013}}\n{{condense|date=April 2015}}\n}}\n\n\nAsiamanism \n\nAs the name implies was taken after the a Man called Asiama \n\nA young Ghanaian graduate who could neither speak nor write good......\n\n==Etymology ==\nThe root word \"pay\" in \"payment\" comes from the Latin \"pacare\" (to pacify), from \"pax\", meaning \"peace\". In the Middle Ages, the term began to be used more broadly, to mean \"to pacify one's creditors\". As the Latin word was made part of Old French \"paier\", it retained the meaning \"appease\" but gained the meaning \"to pay\" (as in paying a debt). The Middle English word \"payen\", which came from French, was also used in both ways.<ref>''The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories''. Merriam-Webster Inc., 1991. p. 350.</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThere are two types of payment methods; [[Financial transaction|exchanging]] and [[Provision (accounting)|provisioning]]. Exchanging involves the use of [[money]], comprising [[banknote]]s and [[coin]]s. Provisioning involves the transfer of money from one account to another, and involves a third party. [[Credit card]], [[debit card]], [[cheque]], [[Electronic funds transfer|money transfer]]s, and recurring cash or ACH ([[Automated Clearing House]]) disbursements are all electronic payments methods. Electronic payments technologies include [[magnetic stripe card]]s, [[smartcard]]s, [[contactless smart card|contactless cards]], and mobile payments.\n\n== Parties involved ==\nA payment may involve more than two parties. For example, a [[credit card|pre paid card]] transaction usually involves four parties: the purchaser, the seller, the [[issuing bank]] and the [[acquiring bank]]. A cash payment requires at least three parties: the seller, the purchaser and the issuer of the currency. A barter payment requires a minimum of two parties: the purchaser and the seller.\n\n== Providers ==\nThe infrastructure and electronic clearing methods are formed by the [[Payment service provider|payment provider]]. Global credit card payment providers are [[Diners Club]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]], [[American Express]] and [[MasterCard]]. [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]] and [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]] are international debit card payment providers.\n\n== Interbank ==\nThe ''central bank CB(Ccy)'' of a currency can maintain a '''loro account''' for a bank (which the bank would call a '''[[Nostro and vostro accounts|nostro]]''' account).\n\n=== Direct ===\nA bank ''P'' (the ''payer'') with a central bank nostro can ''pay directly'' to another bank ''R'' (the ''receiver'') which has also a nostro with ''CB(Ccy)'' by instructing the central bank to make a payment of ''N[Ccy]'' (or an amount ''N'' in ''Ccy''). \nThe central bank however will only accept ''P''s payment instruction if the balance ''B'' on P's loro account before the payment is ''B\u2265N''. The payment itself is a booking in the loro accounts of the central bank where P's loro account is debited with ''N'' (it will be ''B-N\u22650'' thereafter) and simultaneously ''R''s loro account is credit with ''N'' (its balance ''C'' will be ''C+N\u22650'' thereafter).\n\nWe denote the payment symbolically with ''[P\u2192CB\u2192R]''.\n\n=== Indirect ===\nIf the payer ''P'' maintains a loro account for another bank ''X'', ''P'' can act as a payment agent for ''X'':\n''X'' instructs ''P'' to pay to ''R''; then ''P'' instructs ''CB(Ccy)'' to pay on behalf of ''X'': [''X\u2192P\u2192CB\u2192R''].\n\nIn this example the first half of the payment is ''indirect'' and the second one (from ''CB(Ccy)'' to ''R'') is still ''direct''. If ''X'' would pay via ''P'' to ''R'' and finally to another party ''Y'', the payment would be 'fully indirect': [''X\u2192P\u2192CB\u2192R\u2192Y''].\nIn practice, not every payment agent might have a direct nostro with the central bank, thus rather weird payment constellations can exist, which are hard to describe.\n\n=== Directness coefficient ''(p,q)'' ===\nIf we define '''(p,q)''' where ''p'' is number of parties on the sender side and ''q'' on the receiver side, we can classify the directness of payments.\n\n=== ''S<sub>n</sub>,R<sub>m</sub>'' Description ===\nWe denote with ''S<sub>n</sub>'' the senders and with ''R<sub>m</sub>'' the receivers in a payment process, such that\n\n''R<sub>0</sub>=S<sub>0</sub>=CB<sub>CCY</sub>'' is the central bank of the currency which has 'no' distance (''n=m=0'') to the payment process,\n\n''m,n=1'': the ''direct'' nostro agents of the sender / receiver:  \nS<sub>1</sub> is the ''direct payer''; R<sub>1</sub> is the ''direct receiver'' (or nostro agent)\n\n''m,n=2'': the ''indirect nostro agents'' of the sender / receiver:  \nS<sub>2</sub> is the ''indirect payer''; R<sub>2</sub> is the ''indirect receiver''\n\n''m,n=3'': the ''sender / payer bank'' :  \nS<sub>3</sub> is the ''sender bank''; R<sub>3</sub> is the ''receiver bank''\n\n''m,n=4'': the ''sender / payer'':  \nS<sub>4</sub> is the ''sender (payer)''; R<sub>4</sub> is the ''receiver (payee)''\n\nHere is an (p=q=4) example:\n\n [sender\u2192sender bank \u2192 indirect agent of sender bank \u2192 direct agent of sender bank \u2192 central bank \u2192 direct agent of receiver bank \u2192 indirect agent of receiver bank \u2192 receiver bank \u2192 receiver(payee)]\n\nor\n [S<sub>4</sub> \u2192 S<sub>3</sub> \u2192 S<sub>2</sub> \u2192 S<sub>1</sub> \u2192 S<sub>0</sub>=R<sub>0</sub> \u2192 R<sub>1</sub> \u2192 R<sub>2</sub> \u2192 R<sub>3</sub> \u2192 R<sub>4</sub>]\n\n== Global market ==\nIn 2005, an estimated $40 trillion globally passed through some type of payment system. Roughly $12 trillion of that was transacted through various credit cards, mostly the 21,000 member banks of [[Visa (credit card)|Visa]] and [[MasterCard]].  Processing payments, including the extending of credit, produced close to $500 billion in revenue.<ref>McKinsey and Company, 2006</ref>  In 2012, roughly $377 trillion passed through noncash payment systems.  This led to total account and transaction revenues close to $524 billion.<ref>Boston Consulting Group, [http://www.swift.com/assets/swift_com/documents/products_services/BCG_Global_Payments_Report_2013_Sep_2013.pdf \"Global Payments 2013\"], September 2013</ref>\n\n=== Debit cards ===\nIn the U.S., [[debit card]]s are the fastest growing payment technology. In 2001, debit cards accounted for 9 percent of all purchase transactions, and this is expected to double to 18.82 percent in 2011.<ref>The Nilson Report, Issue 761, April 2002</ref>\n\n=== Cheques ===\n{{Main|Cheque clearing}}\nHistorically, [[cheques]] have been one of the primary means of payment for purchasing goods and services, though its share in the payment mix is falling worldwide. In 2001, in the United States, cheques accounted for 25% of the U.S.-based payment mix; and in 2006, this was projected to fall to 17%.<ref>The Nilson Report</ref>\n\nIn the United States, a cheque as a form of payment can legally be refused for any reason (or no reason).{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} A payment by cheque is not a \"payment\" until the cheque has been cashed (i.e., deposited) and cleared by the banking system.\n\n== Timing ==\nThe timing of a payment has legal implication in some situations. For tax purposes, for example, the timing of a payment may determine whether it qualifies as a [[Tax deduction|deduction]] in a taxpayer's calculation of [[taxable income]] in one year or the next.\n\nFor U.S. tax purposes, [[cash]] payments generally are taken to occur at the time of payment. Payment may also occur when a person transfers property or performs a service to the payee in satisfaction of an obligation.<ref name=\"donaldson\">See Donaldson, Samuel A., Federal Income Taxation of Individuals: Cases, Problems and Materials, 734 (2nd. Ed. 2007).</ref> A payment by check is normally deemed to occur when the check is delivered, as long as the check is honored on presentation by the payee. This rule also generally applies where the check is not presented to the bank until the next taxable year, and even though the payer could stop payment on the check in the meantime.<ref>''Estate of Spiegel v. Commissioner'', 12 T.C. 524 (1949).</ref>  [[Postdated check]]s, however, are not considered payment when delivered.<ref>''Griffin v. Commissioner,'' 49 T.C. 253 (1967).</ref>  Generally, payments by [[credit card]] take effect at the point of the sale and not when a payer is billed by the credit card company or when the payer pays the credit card company's bill.<ref>Revenue Ruling 78-38, 1978-1 C.B. 67.</ref> A business that reports on an accrual basis, would report income in the year of sale though payment may be received in a subsequent year.\n\nPayment of most fees to government agencies by cheque, if permitted, usually takes effect after a set number of days for [[Cheque clearing|clearance]] or until the cheque is actually cleared. Payments by credit card, if permitted, and cash payments take immediate effect. Normally, no other forms of payment are permitted or accepted.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Accounting]]\n* [[Alternative Payments]]\n* [[APACS]] (The UK Payments Association)\n* [[Business]]\n* [[Commerce]]\n* [[Financial transaction]] \n* [[Money]]\n* [[Money transmitter]]\n* [[Trade]]\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==References==\n*finn.

The party making a payment is commonly called the '''payer''', while the '''payee''' is the party receiving the payment.\n\nPayments can be effected in a number of ways, for example: \n* the use of [[money]], [[cheque]], or [[Direct debit|debit]], [[Credit (finance)|credit]] or [[bank transfer]]s. \n* the transfer of anything of value, such as [[stock]], or using [[barter]], the exchange of one good or service for another. \n\nIn general, the payee is at liberty to determine what method of payment he or she will accept; though normally laws require the payer to accept the country's [[legal tender]] up to a prescribed limit. Payment is most commonly effected in the local currency of the payee, unless if the parties agree otherwise. Payment in another currency involves an additional [[Foreign exchange market|foreign exchange]] transaction. The payee may [[compromise]] on a debt, i.e., accept a part payment in full settlement of a debtor's obligation, or may offer a discount, E.G: For payment in cash, or for prompt payment, etc. On the other hand, the payee may impose a [[Surcharge (payment systems)|surcharge]], for example, as a late payment fee, or for use of a certain credit card, etc.\n\nPayments are frequently preceded by an [[invoice]] or bill, which follow the supply of goods or services, but in some industries (such as travel and hotels) it is becoming common for '''pre-payments''' to be required before the service is performed or provided. In some industries, a '''deposit''' may be required before services are performed, which acts as a part pre-payment or as security to the service provider. In some cases, '''progress payments''' are made in advance, and in some cases '''part payments''' are accepted, which do not extinguish the payer\u2019s legal obligations. The acceptance of a payment by the payee extinguishes a debt or other obligation. A [[creditor]] cannot unreasonably refuse to accept a payment, but payment can be refused in some circumstances, for example, on a Sunday or outside banking hours. A payee is usually obligated to acknowledge payment by producing a [[receipt]] to the payer. A receipt may be an endorsement on an account as \"paid in full\". The giving of a guarantee or other security for a debt does not constitute a payment.\n\n==Etymology ==\nThe root word \"pay\" in \"payment\" comes from the Latin \"pacare\" (to pacify), from \"pax\", meaning \"peace\". In the Middle Ages, the term began to be used more broadly, to mean \"to pacify one's creditors\". As the Latin word was made part of Old French \"paier\", it retained the meaning \"appease\" but gained the meaning \"to pay\" (as in paying a debt). The Middle English word \"payen\", which came from French, was also used in both ways.<ref>''The Merriam-Webster New Book of Word Histories''.
