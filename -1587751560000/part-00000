Most of the settlements were located close to rivers, with fewer settlements located on the plateaus. Most early dwellings took the form of [[pit-house]]s, though they were accompanied by an ever-increasing incidence of above-ground clay houses.<ref name=\":0\" /> The floors and hearths of these structures were made of clay, and the walls of clay-plastered wood or reeds. Roofing was made of thatched straw or reeds.\n\nThe inhabitants were involved with [[animal husbandry]], [[agriculture]], [[fishing]] and [[Hunter-gatherer|gathering]]. [[Wheat]], [[rye]] and [[pea]]s were grown. Tools included [[plough]]s made of [[antler]], stone, bone and sharpened sticks. The harvest was collected with [[scythe]]s made of flint-inlaid blades. The grain was milled into [[flour]] by [[quern-stone]]s. Women were involved in [[pottery]], [[textile]]- and [[clothing|garment]]-making, and played a leading role in community life. Men [[hunting|hunted]], [[herding|herded]] the livestock, made tools from flint, bone and stone. Of their livestock, [[cattle]] were the most important, with [[pig|swine]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s playing lesser roles. The question of whether or not the [[horse]] was [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] during this time of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture is disputed among historians; horse remains have been found in some of their settlements, but it is unclear whether these remains were from [[wild horse]]s or domesticated ones.\n\nClay statues of females and amulets have been found dating to this period. Copper items, primarily bracelets, rings and hooks, are occasionally found as well. A hoard of a large number of copper items was discovered in the village of [[C\u0103rbuna]], Moldova, consisting primarily of items of jewelry, which were dated back to the beginning of the fifth millennium BCE. Some historians have used this evidence to support the theory that a social stratification was present in early Cucuteni culture, but this is disputed by others.<ref name=\"Monah\" />\n\nPottery remains from this early period are very rarely discovered; the remains that have been found indicate that the ceramics were used after being [[pit fired pottery|fired in a kiln]]. The outer colour of the pottery is a smoky grey, with raised and sunken [[relief]] decorations. Toward the end of this early Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia period, the pottery begins to be painted before firing. The white-painting technique found on some of the pottery from this period was imported from the earlier and contemporary (5th millennium) [[Gumelni\u021ba\u2013Karanovo culture]].

During this period, the population immigrated into and settled along the banks of the upper and middle regions of the [[Right-bank Ukraine|Right Bank]] (or western side) of the Dnieper River, in present-day Ukraine. The population grew considerably during this time, resulting in settlements being established on plateaus, near major rivers and springs.\n\nTheir dwellings were built by placing vertical poles in the form of circles or ovals. The construction techniques incorporated log floors covered in clay, [[Wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]] walls that were woven from pliable branches and covered in clay and a clay [[oven]], which was situated in the centre of the dwelling. As the population in this area grew, more land was put under cultivation. Hunting supplemented the practice of animal husbandry of domestic livestock.\n\nTools made of flint, rock, clay, wood and bones continued to be used for cultivation and other chores. Much less common than other materials, copper axes and other tools have been discovered that were made from ore mined in [[Volyn Oblast|Volyn]], Ukraine, as well as some deposits along the Dnieper river. Pottery-making by this time had become sophisticated, however they still relied on techniques of making pottery by hand (the [[potter's wheel]] was not used yet). Characteristics of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia pottery included a [[Monochrome|monochromic]] spiral design, painted with black paint on a yellow and red base. Large pear-shaped pottery for the storage of grain, dining plates and other goods, was also prevalent. Additionally, ceramic statues of female \"goddess\" figures, as well as figurines of animals and models of houses dating to this period have also been discovered.\n\nSome scholars{{Who|date=September 2018}} have used the abundance of these clay female [[Fetishism|fetish]] statues to base the theory that this culture was [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]] in nature. Indeed, it was partially the archaeological evidence from Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture that inspired [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Joseph Campbell]] and some latter 20th century [[Second-wave feminism|feminists]] to set forth the [[goddess movement|popular theory]] of an [[Old European culture]] of peaceful, egalitarian (counter to a widespread misconception, ''not'' matriarchal<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sibyllineorder.org/history/hist_marija.htm |title=Interview with Marija Gimbutas |accessdate=2016-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007222300/http://www.sibyllineorder.org/history/hist_marija.htm |archivedate=2016-10-07 }}</ref>), [[goddess movement#Prehistoric cultures|goddess-centred]] neolithic European societies that were wiped out by [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]], [[Sky father|Sky Father]]-worshipping, warlike, [[Bronze-Age]] [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] tribes that swept out of [[Eurasian Steppe|the steppes]] north and east of the Black Sea.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}<!-- The following sentence is a strawman, Gimbutas intentionally did not call it a matriarchy, because she explicitly opposed the idea of \"a strictly matriarchal society\", and the matriarchy angle is the only aspect that the quote shows is discredited, except that is not even part of her theory: This theory [actually: The idea of a matriarchy] has been discredited by some in recent years,<ref>{{Citation | contribution=\"The view of matriarchy as constituting a stage of cultural development now is generally discredited.

Members of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture who lived along the coastal regions near the [[Black Sea]] came into contact with other cultures. Animal husbandry increased in importance, as hunting diminished; horses also became more important. The community transformed into a patriarchal structure. Outlying communities were established on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and [[Volga River|Volga]] rivers in present-day [[Russia]]. Dwellings were constructed differently from previous periods, and a new rope-like design replaced the older spiral-patterned designs on the pottery. Different forms of ritual burial were developed where the deceased were interred in the ground with elaborate burial rituals. An increasingly larger number of Bronze Age artefacts originating from other lands were found as the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture drew near.<ref name=\"Monah\" />\n\n=== Decline and end ===\n{{Main|Decline and end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture}}\nThere is a debate among scholars regarding how the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture took place.\n\nAccording to some proponents of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] of the origin of Proto-Indo-Europeans, and in particular the archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]], in her book ''\"Notes on the chronology and expansion of the Pit-Grave Culture\"'' (1961, later expanded by her and others), the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture was destroyed by force. Arguing from archaeological and linguistic evidence, Gimbutas concluded that the people of the [[Kurgan culture]] (a term grouping the [[Yamnaya culture]] and its predecessors) of the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]], being most likely speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], effectively destroyed the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture in a series of invasions undertaken during their expansion to the west. Based on this archaeological evidence Gimbutas saw distinct cultural differences between the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]], [[warrior|warlike]] Kurgan culture and the more peaceful egalitarian Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture, which she argued was a significant component of the \"[[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old European cultures]]\" which finally met extinction in a process visible in the progressing appearance of fortified settlements, [[hillfort]]s and the graves of warrior-chieftains, as well as in the religious transformation from the matriarchy to patriarchy, in a correlated east\u2013west movement.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gimbutas|1982|p=1}}</ref> In this, \"the process of Indo-Europeanization was a cultural, not a physical, transformation and must be understood as a military victory in terms of successfully imposing a new administrative system, language, and religion upon the indigenous groups.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gimbutas|Dexter|Jones-Bley|1997|p=309}}</ref> Accordingly, these proponents of the Kurgan hypothesis hold that this invasion took place during the third wave of Kurgan expansion between 3000\u20132800 BC, permanently ending the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture.\n\nIn his 1989 book ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans'', Irish-American archaeologist [[J. P. Mallory]], summarising the three existing theories concerning the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture, mentions that archaeological findings in the region indicate Kurgan (i.e. [[Yamnaya culture]]) settlements in the eastern part of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia area, co-existing for some time with those of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia.<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> Artifacts from both cultures found within each of their respective archaeological settlement sites attest to an open trade in goods for a period,<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> though he points out that the archaeological evidence clearly points to what he termed \"a dark age,\" its population seeking refuge in every direction except east. He cites evidence of the refugees having used caves, islands and hilltops (abandoning in the process 600\u2013700 settlements) to argue for the possibility of a gradual transformation rather than an armed onslaught bringing about cultural extinction.<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> The obvious issue with that theory is the limited common historical life-time between the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia (4800\u20133000 BC) and the [[Yamnaya culture]] (3300\u20132600 BC); given that the earliest archaeological findings of the Yamnaya culture are located in the [[Volga River|Volga]]\u2013[[Don River (Russia)|Don]] basin, not in the [[Dniester]] and [[Dnieper]] area where the cultures came in touch, while the Yamnaya culture came to its full extension in the Pontic steppe at the earliest around 3000 BC, the time the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture ended, thus indicating an extremely short survival after coming in contact with the Yamnaya culture. Another contradicting indication is that the kurgans that replaced the traditional horizontal graves in the area now contain human remains of a fairly diversified skeletal type approximately ten centimetres taller on average than the previous population.<ref name=\"Mallory\" />\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, another theory regarding the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture emerged based on climatic change that took place at the end of their culture's existence that is known as the [[Blytt\u2013Sernander system#Sub-Boreal|Blytt\u2013Sernander Sub-Boreal]] phase. Beginning around 3200 BC, the earth's climate became colder and drier than it had ever been since the end of the last [[Ice age]], resulting in the worst drought in the history of Europe since the beginning of agriculture.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">Anthony, David W.

Summer temperatures increased sharply, and precipitation decreased, according to carbon-14 dating. According to that theory, the neighboring Yamnaya culture people were [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]], and were able to maintain their survival much more effectively in drought conditions. This has led some scholars to come to the conclusion that the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture ended not violently, but as a matter of survival, converting their economy from agriculture to pastoralism, and becoming integrated into the Yamnaya culture.<ref name=\"Khol\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated79\" /><ref name=\"DeMeo\">{{cite book|last1=DeMeo|first1=James|title=Saharasia: the 4000 BCE origins of child abuse, sex-repression, warfare and social violence in the deserts of the Old World: the revolutionary discovery of a geographic basis to human behavior|year=1998|publisher=Orgone Biophysical Research Lab|location=Greensprings, Oregon|isbn=0-9621855-5-8|oclc=39569359}}</ref>}} However, the Blytt\u2013Sernander approach as a way to identify stages of technology in Europe with specific climate periods is an oversimplification not generally accepted.

To this must be added that the first period of the climate transformation ended 500 years before the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture and the second approximately 1400 years after.\n\n== Economy ==\n{{Main|Economy of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture}}\nThroughout the 2,750 years of its existence, the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture was fairly stable and static; however, there were changes that took place. This article addresses some of these changes that have to do with the economic aspects. These include the basic economic conditions of the culture, the development of trade, interaction with other cultures and the apparent use of barter tokens, an early form of money.\n\nMembers of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture shared common features with other Neolithic societies, including:\n* An almost nonexistent [[social stratification]]\n* Lack of a [[Acephalous society|political elite]]\n* Rudimentary [[economy]], most likely a [[Subsistence economy|subsistence]] or [[gift economy]]\n* [[Pastoralism|Pastoralists]] and [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]]\nEarlier societies of [[hunter-gatherer]] [[tribe]]s had no social stratification, and later societies of the [[Bronze Age]] had noticeable social stratification, which saw the creation of [[Division of labour|occupational specialization]], the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[Class stratification|social classes]] of individuals who were of the elite [[Ruling class|ruling]] or [[Clergy|religious]] classes, full-time [[warrior]]s and wealthy [[Barter|merchants]], contrasted with those individuals on the other end of the [[Social class|economic spectrum]] who were [[Poverty|poor]], [[History of slavery|enslaved]] and [[Hunger|hungry]]. In between these two economic models (the hunter-gatherer tribes and Bronze Age civilisations) we find the later Neolithic and [[Copper Age|Eneolithic]] societies such as the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture, where the first indications of social stratification began to be found. However, it would be a mistake to overemphasise the impact of social stratification in the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture, since it was still (even in its later phases) very much an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society. And of course, social stratification was just one of the many aspects of what is regarded as a fully established [[Civilization|civilised society]], which began to appear in the Bronze Age.<ref name=\"Khol\" />\n\nLike other Neolithic societies, the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture had almost no [[division of labor]]. Although this culture's settlements sometimes grew to become the largest on Earth at the time (up to 15,000 people in the largest),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=John|last2=Videiko|first2=Mikhail Yu|last3=Hale|first3=Duncan|last4=Gaydarska|first4=Bisserka|last5=Burdo|first5=Natalia|last6=Rassmann|first6=Knut|last7=Mischka|first7=Carsten|last8=M\u00fcller|first8=Johannes|last9=Korvin-Piotrovskiy|first9=Aleksey|date=2014|title=The Second Phase of the Trypillia Mega-Site Methodological Revolution: A New Research Agenda|journal=European Journal of Archaeology|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=369\u2013406|doi=10.1179/1461957114Y.0000000062|issn=1461-9571|doi-access=free}}</ref> there is no evidence that has been discovered of labour specialisation. Every household probably had members of the extended family who would work in the fields to raise crops, go to the woods to hunt game and bring back firewood, work by the river to bring back clay or fish and all of the other duties that would be needed to survive. Contrary to popular belief, the Neolithic people experienced considerable abundance of food and other resources.<ref name=\"Mantu\" />\n\nSince every household was almost entirely self-sufficient, there was very little need for trade. However, there were certain mineral resources that, because of limitations due to distance and prevalence, did form the rudimentary foundation for a trade network that towards the end of the culture began to develop into a more complex system, as is attested to by an increasing number of artifacts from other cultures that have been dated to the latter period.<ref name=\"Mallory\" />\n\nToward the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture's existence (from roughly 3000 BC to 2750 BC), [[copper]] traded from other societies (notably, from the [[Balkans]]) began to appear throughout the region, and members of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture began to acquire skills necessary to use it to create various items. Along with the raw copper ore, finished copper tools, hunting weapons and other artefacts were also brought in from other cultures.<ref name=\"Mantu\" /> This marked the transition from the Neolithic to the Eneolithic, also known as the Chalcolithic or Copper Age. Bronze artifacts began to show up in archaeological sites toward the very end of the culture.

Cultivating the soil (using an [[ard (plough)|ard]] or scratch plough), harvesting crops and tending livestock was probably the main occupation for most people. Typically for a Neolithic culture, the vast{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} majority of their diet consisted of [[cereal]] grains. They cultivated [[Common wheat|club wheat]], [[oats]], [[rye]], [[proso millet]], [[barley]] and [[hemp]], which were probably ground and baked as [[Flatbread|unleavened bread]] in clay ovens or on heated stones in the home. They also grew peas and beans, [[apricot]], [[cherry plum]] and [[Vitis vinifera|wine grapes]] \u2013 though there is no solid evidence that they actually made [[wine]].<ref name=\"Com\u0219a\">{{cite journal | last = Com\u0219a | first = Eugen | title = Cultura plantelor \u00een cursul epocii neolitice pe teritoriul Rom\u00e2niei |trans-title=Cultivated plants of the Neolithic current epoch in Romanian territory | journal = Terra Nostra: Culegere de Materiale Privind Istoria Agriculturii \u00een Rom\u00e2nia (Our Earth: Selections from a Material Perspective of Agricultural History in Romania) | volume = 3 | pages = 243\u2013252 | publisher = Consiliul Superior al Agriculturii | location = Bucharest | year = 1973 | oclc = 72954112}}</ref> There is also evidence that they may have kept bees.<ref>{{Citation | last = Crane | first = Eva | title = The world history of beekeeping and honey hunting |  place = New York | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | pages = 40\u201341 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ANTSvKj1AZEC | oclc = 41049690 | isbn = 0-415-92467-7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[zooarchaeology]] of Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia sites indicate that the inhabitants practiced animal husbandry. Their domesticated livestock consisted primarily of cattle, but included smaller numbers of pigs, sheep and goats. There is evidence, based on some of the surviving artistic depictions of animals from Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia sites, that the [[ox]] was employed as a [[Working animal|draft animal]].<ref name=\"Com\u0219a\" />\n\nBoth remains and artistic depictions of horses have been discovered at Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia sites. However, whether these finds are of domesticated or wild horses is debated. Before they were domesticated, humans hunted wild horses for meat. On the other hand, one hypothesis of [[horse domestication]] places it in the steppe region adjacent to the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture at roughly the same time (4000\u20133500 BC), so it is possible the culture was familiar with the domestic horse. At this time horses could have been kept both for meat or as a work animal.<ref name=\"Cuco\u02191\">{{cite journal | last = Cuco\u0219 | first = \u0218tefan | title = Faza Cucuteni B \u00een zona subcarpatic\u0103 a Moldovei | trans-title = Cucuteni B period in the lower Carpathian region of Moldova | journal = Bibliotheca Memoriae Antiquitatis (BMA) (Memorial Library Antiquities) | volume = 6 | publisher = Muzeul de Istorie Piatra Neam\u021b (Historical Museum Piatra Neam\u021b) | location = Piatra Neam\u021b, Romania | year = 1999 | url = http://www.neamt.ro/cmj/istorie/piatra-neamt/BMA_2.html | language = Romanian | oclc = 223302267 | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101009043421/http://www.neamt.ro/cmj/istorie/piatra-neamt/BMA_2.html | archivedate = 2010-10-09 }}</ref> The direct evidence remains inconclusive.<ref>{{Citation|first=Valentin A. |last=Dergachev |contribution=Two studies in defense of the migration concept |conference=McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research, 2000 |editor-last=Boyle |editor-first=Katherine V. |editor2-last=Renfrew |editor2-first=Colin |editor3-last=Levine |editor3-first=Marsha |title=Ancient Interactions: East and West in Eurasia |series=McDonald Institute monographs |year=2002 |pages=93\u2013112 |place=Oxford |publisher=Oxbow Books |url=http://www.mcdonald.cam.ac.uk/publications/monographs/conference-volumes/ |isbn=1-902937-19-8 |oclc=52221476 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221224723/http://www.mcdonald.cam.ac.uk/publications/monographs/conference-volumes/ |archivedate=February 21, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nHunting supplemented the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia diet.

First, the brackish water from the spring was boiled in large pottery vessels, producing a dense [[brine]]. The brine was then heated in a ceramic briquetage vessel until all moisture was evaporated, with the remaining crystallised salt adhering to the inside walls of the vessel. Then the briquetage vessel was broken open, and the salt was scraped from the shards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cimec.ro/arheologie/sarea/index.html|title=Sarea, Timpul \u015fi Omul|first=Vasile|last=Andrei|website=www.cimec.ro|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221030521/http://www.cimec.ro/arheologie/sarea/index.html|archivedate=21 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe provision of salt was a major logistical problem for the largest Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia settlements. As they came to rely upon cereal foods over salty meat and fish, Neolithic cultures had to incorporate supplementary sources of salt into their diet. Similarly, domestic cattle need to be provided with extra sources of salt beyond their normal diet or their milk production is reduced. Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia mega-sites, with a population of likely thousands of people and animals, are estimated to have required between 36,000 and 100,000&nbsp;kg of salt per year. This was not available locally, and so had to be moved in bulk from distant sources on the western Black Sea coast and in the Carpathian Mountains, probably by river.<ref>{{cite book|last=Chapman|first=J|last2=Gaydarska|first2=Bisserka|title=Tripolye settlements-giants.

Long coils of clay were placed in circles to form first the base and then the walls of the vessel. Once the desired shape and height of the finished product was built up the sides would then be smoothed to create a seamless surface. This technique was the earliest form of pottery shaping and the most common in the Neolithic; however, there is some evidence that they also used a primitive type of slow-turning [[potter's wheel]], an innovation that did not become common in Europe until the [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\"Cuco\u02191\" />\n\nCharacteristically vessels were elaborately decorated with swirling patterns and intricate designs. Sometimes decorative incisions were added prior to firing, and sometimes these were filled with coloured dye to produce a dimensional effect. In the early period, the colours used to decorate pottery were limited to a rusty-red and white. Later, potters added additional colours to their products and experimented with more advanced ceramic techniques.<ref name=\"Monah\"/> The pigments used to decorate ceramics were based on [[iron oxide]] for red hues, [[calcium carbonate]], [[Magnetite|iron magnetite]] and [[Jacobsite|manganese Jacobsite]] ores for black and [[calcium silicate]] for white.

It was used as a support or stand, and upon its discovery was hailed as a symbolic masterpiece of Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture. It is believed that the four stylised feminine silhouettes facing inward in an interlinked circle represented a ''[[Hora (dance)|hora]]'', or ritualistic dance. Similar artefacts were later found in [[Bere\u015fti]] and [[Dr\u0103gu\u015feni, Ia\u015fi|Dr\u0103gu\u0219eni]].\n\nExtant figurines excavated at the Cucuteni sites are thought to represent religious artefacts, but their meaning or use is still unknown.

Archaeologists have identified many of these as [[Fetishism|fetishes]] or [[totem]]s, which are believed to be imbued with powers that can help and protect the people who look after them.<ref name=\"Bailey\" /> These Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia figurines have become known popularly as goddesses; however, this term is not necessarily accurate for all female anthropomorphic clay figurines, as the archaeological evidence suggests that different figurines were used for different purposes (such as for protection), and so are not all representative of a goddess.<ref name=\"Bailey\" /> There have been so many of these figurines discovered in Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia sites<ref name=\"Bailey\" /> that many museums in eastern Europe have a sizeable collection of them, and as a result, they have come to represent one of the more readily identifiable visual markers of this culture to many people.\n\nThe archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]] based at least part of her [[Kurgan Hypothesis]] and [[Old European culture]] theories on these Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia clay figurines. Her conclusions, which were always controversial, today are discredited by many scholars,<ref name=\"Bailey\" /> but still there are some scholars who support her theories about how neolithic societies were [[matriarchal]], non-warlike, and worshipped an \"earthy\" [[mother goddess]], but were subsequently wiped out by invasions of [[patriarchal]] Indo-European tribes who burst out of the steppes of Russia and Kazakhstan beginning around 2500 BC, and who worshipped a warlike [[Sky father|Sky God]].<ref name=\"Collins\">{{cite web | url = http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~gloria/Goddess.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/19991012001508/http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~gloria/Goddess.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 12 October 1999 | title = Will the \"Great Goddess\" resurface?: Reflections in Neolithic Europe | first = Gloria | last = Collins | publisher = University of Texas at Austin | location = Austin, Texas | accessdate = 1 December 2009 | postscript = This site was a student brief done for a class assignment. }}</ref> However, Gimbutas' theories have been partially discredited by more recent discoveries and analyses.<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> Today there are many scholars who disagree with Gimbutas, pointing to new evidence that suggests a much more complex society during the Neolithic era than she had been accounting for.<ref>Pre- & protohistorie van de lage landen, onder redactie van J.H.F.

Although very large settlements have been explored by archaeologists, the evidence for mortuary activity is almost invisible. Making a distinction between the eastern Trypillia and the western Cucuteni regions of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia geographical area, American archaeologist Douglass W. Bailey writes: <blockquote>There are no Cucuteni cemeteries and the Trypillia ones that have been discovered are very late.<ref name=\"Bailey\" />{{rp|page=115}}</blockquote> The discovery of skulls is more frequent than other parts of the body, however because there has not yet been a comprehensive statistical survey done of all of the skeletal remains discovered at Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia sites, precise [[post excavation]] analysis of these discoveries cannot be accurately determined at this time. Still, many questions remain concerning these issues, as well as why there seems to have been no male remains found at all.<ref>{{Citation | last = Gimbutas | first = Marija Alseikait\u0117 | title = The civilization of the Goddess: the world of Old Europe | place = San Francisco | publisher = HarperSanFrancisco | year = 1991 | url = https://archive.org/details/civilizationofgo0000gimb | isbn = 0-06-250368-5 | oclc = 123210574 | url-status = dead | access-date = 2009-12-11 | url-access = registration }}</ref> The only definite conclusion that can be drawn from archaeological evidence is that in the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture, in the vast majority of cases, the bodies were not formally deposited within the settlement area.<ref name=\"Bailey\" />{{rp|page=116}}\n\n== Vin\u010da\u2013Turda\u0219 script ==\n<br />{{Main|Symbols and proto-writing of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture|Vin\u010da symbols}}\nThe mainstream academic theory is that writing first appeared during the [[Sumerian civilisation]] in southern [[Mesopotamia]], around 3300\u20133200 BC. in the form of the [[Cuneiform script]]. This first writing system did not suddenly appear out of nowhere,{{original research inline|date=July 2016}} but gradually developed from less stylised pictographic systems that used [[ideogram|ideographic]] and [[mnemonic]] symbols that contained meaning, but did not have the linguistic flexibility of the [[natural language]] writing system that the Sumerians first conceived. These earlier symbolic systems have been labelled as [[proto-writing]], examples of which have been discovered in a variety of places around the world, some dating back to the 7th millennium BC.<ref name=\"Merlini\">{{Citation | last = Merlini | first = Marco | title = An Inquiry into the Danube Script | series = Brukenthal National Museum Foreign Languages Publications | place = Alba Iulia, Romania | publisher = Editura Altip | year = 2009 | page = 680 | url = http://www.brukenthalmuseum.ro/publicatii_en/03.htm}}</ref>\n\n<br />\n<gallery widths=\"250\" heights=\"250\">\nFile:Tartaria amulet retouched.PNG|One of the three [[T\u0103rt\u0103ria tablets]], dated 5300 BC\nFile:Gradeshnitsa front.jpg|One of the [[Gradeshnitsa tablets]]\n</gallery>\nOne such early example of a proto-writing system are the [[Vin\u010da symbols]], which is a set of symbols depicted on clay artefacts associated with the [[Vin\u010da culture]], which flourished along the [[Danube River]] in the [[Pannonian Plain]], between 6000 and 4000 BC. The first discovery of this script occurred at the archaeological site in the village of [[Turda\u015f]] (Romania), and consisted of a collection of artefacts that had what appeared to be an unknown system of writing. In 1908, more of these same kinds of artefacts were discovered at a site near [[Vin\u010da]], outside the city of [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. Scholars subsequently labelled this the \"Vin\u010da script\" or \"Vin\u010da\u2013Turda\u015f script\". There is a considerable amount of controversy surrounding the Vin\u010da script as to how old it is, as well as whether it should be considered as an actual writing system, an example of proto-writing, or just a collection of meaningful symbols. Indeed, the entire subject regarding every aspect of the Vin\u010da script is fraught with controversy.<ref name=\"Merlini\" />\n\nBeginning in 1875 up to the present, archaeologists have found more than a thousand Neolithic era clay artefacts that have examples of symbols similar to the Vin\u010da script scattered widely throughout south-eastern Europe. This includes the discoveries of what appear to be [[Barter tokens of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture|barter tokens]], which were used as an early form of currency. Thus it appears that the Vin\u010da or Vin\u010da\u2013Turda\u015f script is not restricted to just the region around Belgrade, which is where the Vin\u010da culture existed, but that it was spread across most of southeastern Europe, and was used throughout the geographical region of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture. As a result of this widespread use of this set of symbolic representations, historian Marco Merlini has suggested that it be given a name other than the Vin\u010da script, since this implies that it was only used among the Vin\u010da culture around the Pannonian Plain, at the very western edge of the extensive area where examples of this symbolic system have been discovered. Merlini has proposed naming this system the [[Vin\u010da symbols|Danube Script]], which some scholars have begun to accept.<ref name=\"Merlini2\">{{cite journal | last= Merlini | first= Marco | first2= Gheorghe | last2= Lazarovici | editor1-first= Sabin Adrian | editor1-last= Luca | year= 2008 | title= Settling discovery circumstances, dating and utilization of the T\u0103rt\u0103ria Tablets | journal= Acta Terrae Septemcastrensis | volume= 8 | series= Proceedings of the International Colloquium: The Carpathian Basin and its Role in the Neolithisation of the Balkan Peninsula | pages= 111\u2013195 | publisher= Bucure\u015fti Editura Economica | location= Bucharest, Romania | issn= 1583-1817 | oclc= 445461856 | url= http://arheologie.ulbsibiu.ro/publicatii/ats/ats8/merlini.pdf | accessdate= 17 January 2010 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722210229/http://arheologie.ulbsibiu.ro/publicatii/ats/ats8/merlini.pdf | archivedate= 22 July 2011 }}</ref> However, even this name change would not be extensive enough, since it does not cover the region in Ukraine, as well as the Balkans, where examples of these symbols are also found.

It revealed that seven of the individuals whose remains where analysed belonged to: two to [[Haplogroup HV (mtDNA)|haplogroup HV(xH)]], two to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|haplogroup H]], one to [[Haplogroup R0 (mtDNA)|haplogroup R0(xHV)]], one to [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|haplogroup J]] and one to [[Haplogroup T4 (mtDNA)|haplogroup T4]], the latter also being the oldest sample of the set.\n\nThe authors conclude that the population living around Verteba Cave was fairly heterogenous, but that the wide chronological age of the specimens might indicate that the heterogeneity might have been due to natural population flow during this timeframe. The authors also link the R0(xHV) and HV(xH) haplogroups with European [[Paleolithic]] populations, and consider the T4 and J haplogroups as hallmarks of Neolithic demic intrusions from the southeast (the north-pontic region) rather than from the west (i.e. the [[Linear Pottery culture]]).<ref name=\"Nikitin\">{{cite journal\n |last1       = Nikitin\n |first1      = Alexey G.\n |first2      = Mykhailo P.\n |last2       = Sokhatsky\n |first3      = Mykola M.\n |last3       = Kovaliukh\n |first4      = Mykhailo Y.\n |last4       = Videiko\n |title       = Comprehensive Site Chronology and Ancient Mitochondrial DNA Analysis from Verteba Cave \u2013 a Trypillian Culture Site of Eneolithic Ukraine\n |journal     = Interdisciplinaria Archaeologica \u2013 Natural Sciences in Archaeology\n |issue       = 1\u20132\n |pages       = 9\u201318\n |publisher   = Archaeological Centre Olomouc, Government Funded Organisation\n |date        = 14 April 2011\n |url         = http://iansa.eu/papers/IANSA-2010-01-02-nikitin.pdf\n |accessdate  = 14 May 2013\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120424145229/http://www.iansa.eu/papers/IANSA-2010-01-02-nikitin.pdf\n |archivedate = 24 April 2012\n|doi = 10.24916/iansa.2011.1.1\n }}</ref>\n\nA 2017 [[ancient DNA]] study found evidence of genetic contact between the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture and steppe populations from the east from as early as 3600 BCE, well before the influx of [[steppe ancestry]] into Europe associated with the Yamnaya culture.<ref>{{cite biorxiv|last=Mathieson|first=Iain|last2=Roodenberg|first2=Song\u00fcl Alpaslan|last3=Posth|first3=Cosimo|last4=Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi-Nagy|first4=Anna|last5=Rohland|first5=Nadin|last6=Mallick|first6=Swapan|last7=Olalde|first7=I\u00f1igo|last8=Broomandkhoshbacht|first8=Nasreen|last9=Cheronet|first9=Olivia|display-authors=1|date=2017-05-30|title=The Genomic History Of Southeastern Europe|biorxiv=10.1101/135616}}</ref>\n\nA February 2018 study published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] included an analysis of three males from the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture.

[[Wheat]], [[rye]] and [[pea]]s were grown. Tools included [[plough]]s made of [[antler]], stone, bone and sharpened sticks. The harvest was collected with [[scythe]]s made of flint-inlaid blades. The grain was milled into [[flour]] by [[quern-stone]]s. Women were involved in [[pottery]], [[textile]]- and [[clothing|garment]]-making, and played a leading role in community life. Men [[hunting|hunted]], [[herding|herded]] the livestock, made tools from flint, bone and stone. Of their livestock, [[cattle]] were the most important, with [[pig|swine]], [[sheep]] and [[goat]]s playing lesser roles. The question of whether or not the [[horse]] was [[domestication of the horse|domesticated]] during this time of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture is disputed among historians; horse remains have been found in some of their settlements, but it is unclear whether these remains were from [[wild horse]]s or domesticated ones.\n\nClay statues of females and amulets have been found dating to this period. Copper items, primarily bracelets, rings and hooks, are occasionally found as well. A hoard of a large number of copper items was discovered in the village of [[C\u0103rbuna]], Moldova, consisting primarily of items of jewelry, which were dated back to the beginning of the fifth millennium BCE. Some historians have used this evidence to support the theory that a social stratification was present in early Cucuteni culture, but this is disputed by others.<ref name=\"Monah\" />\n\nPottery remains from this early period are very rarely discovered; the remains that have been found indicate that the ceramics were used after being [[pit fired pottery|fired in a kiln]]. The outer colour of the pottery is a smoky grey, with raised and sunken [[relief]] decorations. Toward the end of this early Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia period, the pottery begins to be painted before firing. The white-painting technique found on some of the pottery from this period was imported from the earlier and contemporary (5th millennium) [[Gumelni\u021ba\u2013Karanovo culture]]. Historians point to this transition to kiln-fired, white-painted pottery as the turning point for when the Pre-Cucuteni culture ended and Cucuteni Phase (or Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture) began.<ref name=\"Monah\"/>\n\nCucuteni and the neighbouring Gumelni\u0163a\u2013Karanovo cultures seem to be largely contemporary; the \"Cucuteni A phase seems to be very long (4600\u20134050) and covers the entire evolution of the Gumelni\u021ba\u2013Karanovo A1, A2, B2 phases (maybe 4650\u20134050).\"<ref>Cornelia-Magda Mantu (PDF file) [http://saa.uaic.ro/articles/SAA.7.2000-2001.267-284.pdf Cucuteni\u2013Tripolye Cultural Complex: Relations and Synchronisms with Other Contemporaneous Cultures from the Black Sea Area.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150608054145/http://saa.uaic.ro/articles/SAA.7.2000-2001.267-284.pdf |date=2015-06-08 }} Studia Antiqua et Archaeologica, VII, 2000</ref>\n\n=== Middle period (4000\u20133500 BC) ===\n[[File:CucuteniTreasurePiatraNeamt.JPG|300px|thumb|right|Some of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia copper hoard found at C\u0103rbuna]]\nIn the middle era, the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture spread over a wide area from Eastern [[Transylvania]] in the west to the Dnieper River in the east. During this period, the population immigrated into and settled along the banks of the upper and middle regions of the [[Right-bank Ukraine|Right Bank]] (or western side) of the Dnieper River, in present-day Ukraine. The population grew considerably during this time, resulting in settlements being established on plateaus, near major rivers and springs.\n\nTheir dwellings were built by placing vertical poles in the form of circles or ovals. The construction techniques incorporated log floors covered in clay, [[Wattle and daub|wattle-and-daub]] walls that were woven from pliable branches and covered in clay and a clay [[oven]], which was situated in the centre of the dwelling. As the population in this area grew, more land was put under cultivation. Hunting supplemented the practice of animal husbandry of domestic livestock.\n\nTools made of flint, rock, clay, wood and bones continued to be used for cultivation and other chores. Much less common than other materials, copper axes and other tools have been discovered that were made from ore mined in [[Volyn Oblast|Volyn]], Ukraine, as well as some deposits along the Dnieper river. Pottery-making by this time had become sophisticated, however they still relied on techniques of making pottery by hand (the [[potter's wheel]] was not used yet). Characteristics of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia pottery included a [[Monochrome|monochromic]] spiral design, painted with black paint on a yellow and red base. Large pear-shaped pottery for the storage of grain, dining plates and other goods, was also prevalent. Additionally, ceramic statues of female \"goddess\" figures, as well as figurines of animals and models of houses dating to this period have also been discovered.\n\nSome scholars{{Who|date=September 2018}} have used the abundance of these clay female [[Fetishism|fetish]] statues to base the theory that this culture was [[Matriarchy|matriarchal]] in nature. Indeed, it was partially the archaeological evidence from Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture that inspired [[Marija Gimbutas]], [[Joseph Campbell]] and some latter 20th century [[Second-wave feminism|feminists]] to set forth the [[goddess movement|popular theory]] of an [[Old European culture]] of peaceful, egalitarian (counter to a widespread misconception, ''not'' matriarchal<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sibyllineorder.org/history/hist_marija.htm |title=Interview with Marija Gimbutas |accessdate=2016-07-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007222300/http://www.sibyllineorder.org/history/hist_marija.htm |archivedate=2016-10-07 }}</ref>), [[goddess movement#Prehistoric cultures|goddess-centred]] neolithic European societies that were wiped out by [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]], [[Sky father|Sky Father]]-worshipping, warlike, [[Bronze-Age]] [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] tribes that swept out of [[Eurasian Steppe|the steppes]] north and east of the Black Sea.{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}<!-- The following sentence is a strawman, Gimbutas intentionally did not call it a matriarchy, because she explicitly opposed the idea of \"a strictly matriarchal society\", and the matriarchy angle is the only aspect that the quote shows is discredited, except that is not even part of her theory: This theory [actually: The idea of a matriarchy] has been discredited by some in recent years,<ref>{{Citation | contribution=\"The view of matriarchy as constituting a stage of cultural development now is generally discredited.

Members of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture who lived along the coastal regions near the [[Black Sea]] came into contact with other cultures. Animal husbandry increased in importance, as hunting diminished; horses also became more important. The community transformed into a patriarchal structure. Outlying communities were established on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] and [[Volga River|Volga]] rivers in present-day [[Russia]]. Dwellings were constructed differently from previous periods, and a new rope-like design replaced the older spiral-patterned designs on the pottery. Different forms of ritual burial were developed where the deceased were interred in the ground with elaborate burial rituals. An increasingly larger number of Bronze Age artefacts originating from other lands were found as the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture drew near.<ref name=\"Monah\" />\n\n=== Decline and end ===\n{{Main|Decline and end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture}}\nThere is a debate among scholars regarding how the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture took place.\n\nAccording to some proponents of the [[Kurgan hypothesis]] of the origin of Proto-Indo-Europeans, and in particular the archaeologist [[Marija Gimbutas]], in her book ''\"Notes on the chronology and expansion of the Pit-Grave Culture\"'' (1961, later expanded by her and others), the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture was destroyed by force. Arguing from archaeological and linguistic evidence, Gimbutas concluded that the people of the [[Kurgan culture]] (a term grouping the [[Yamnaya culture]] and its predecessors) of the [[Pontic\u2013Caspian steppe]], being most likely speakers of the [[Proto-Indo-European language]], effectively destroyed the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture in a series of invasions undertaken during their expansion to the west. Based on this archaeological evidence Gimbutas saw distinct cultural differences between the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]], [[warrior|warlike]] Kurgan culture and the more peaceful egalitarian Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture, which she argued was a significant component of the \"[[Old Europe (archaeology)|Old European cultures]]\" which finally met extinction in a process visible in the progressing appearance of fortified settlements, [[hillfort]]s and the graves of warrior-chieftains, as well as in the religious transformation from the matriarchy to patriarchy, in a correlated east\u2013west movement.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gimbutas|1982|p=1}}</ref> In this, \"the process of Indo-Europeanization was a cultural, not a physical, transformation and must be understood as a military victory in terms of successfully imposing a new administrative system, language, and religion upon the indigenous groups.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Gimbutas|Dexter|Jones-Bley|1997|p=309}}</ref> Accordingly, these proponents of the Kurgan hypothesis hold that this invasion took place during the third wave of Kurgan expansion between 3000\u20132800 BC, permanently ending the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture.\n\nIn his 1989 book ''In Search of the Indo-Europeans'', Irish-American archaeologist [[J. P. Mallory]], summarising the three existing theories concerning the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture, mentions that archaeological findings in the region indicate Kurgan (i.e. [[Yamnaya culture]]) settlements in the eastern part of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia area, co-existing for some time with those of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia.<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> Artifacts from both cultures found within each of their respective archaeological settlement sites attest to an open trade in goods for a period,<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> though he points out that the archaeological evidence clearly points to what he termed \"a dark age,\" its population seeking refuge in every direction except east. He cites evidence of the refugees having used caves, islands and hilltops (abandoning in the process 600\u2013700 settlements) to argue for the possibility of a gradual transformation rather than an armed onslaught bringing about cultural extinction.<ref name=\"Mallory\" /> The obvious issue with that theory is the limited common historical life-time between the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia (4800\u20133000 BC) and the [[Yamnaya culture]] (3300\u20132600 BC); given that the earliest archaeological findings of the Yamnaya culture are located in the [[Volga River|Volga]]\u2013[[Don River (Russia)|Don]] basin, not in the [[Dniester]] and [[Dnieper]] area where the cultures came in touch, while the Yamnaya culture came to its full extension in the Pontic steppe at the earliest around 3000 BC, the time the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture ended, thus indicating an extremely short survival after coming in contact with the Yamnaya culture. Another contradicting indication is that the kurgans that replaced the traditional horizontal graves in the area now contain human remains of a fairly diversified skeletal type approximately ten centimetres taller on average than the previous population.<ref name=\"Mallory\" />\n\nIn the 1990s and 2000s, another theory regarding the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture emerged based on climatic change that took place at the end of their culture's existence that is known as the [[Blytt\u2013Sernander system#Sub-Boreal|Blytt\u2013Sernander Sub-Boreal]] phase. Beginning around 3200 BC, the earth's climate became colder and drier than it had ever been since the end of the last [[Ice age]], resulting in the worst drought in the history of Europe since the beginning of agriculture.<ref name=\"autogenerated2007\">Anthony, David W.

Summer temperatures increased sharply, and precipitation decreased, according to carbon-14 dating. According to that theory, the neighboring Yamnaya culture people were [[Pastoralism|pastoralists]], and were able to maintain their survival much more effectively in drought conditions. This has led some scholars to come to the conclusion that the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture ended not violently, but as a matter of survival, converting their economy from agriculture to pastoralism, and becoming integrated into the Yamnaya culture.<ref name=\"Khol\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated2007\" /><ref name=\"autogenerated79\" /><ref name=\"DeMeo\">{{cite book|last1=DeMeo|first1=James|title=Saharasia: the 4000 BCE origins of child abuse, sex-repression, warfare and social violence in the deserts of the Old World: the revolutionary discovery of a geographic basis to human behavior|year=1998|publisher=Orgone Biophysical Research Lab|location=Greensprings, Oregon|isbn=0-9621855-5-8|oclc=39569359}}</ref>}} However, the Blytt\u2013Sernander approach as a way to identify stages of technology in Europe with specific climate periods is an oversimplification not generally accepted.

To this must be added that the first period of the climate transformation ended 500 years before the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture and the second approximately 1400 years after.\n\n== Economy ==\n{{Main|Economy of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture}}\nThroughout the 2,750 years of its existence, the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture was fairly stable and static; however, there were changes that took place. This article addresses some of these changes that have to do with the economic aspects. These include the basic economic conditions of the culture, the development of trade, interaction with other cultures and the apparent use of barter tokens, an early form of money.\n\nMembers of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture shared common features with other Neolithic societies, including:\n* An almost nonexistent [[social stratification]]\n* Lack of a [[Acephalous society|political elite]]\n* Rudimentary [[economy]], most likely a [[Subsistence economy|subsistence]] or [[gift economy]]\n* [[Pastoralism|Pastoralists]] and [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence farmers]]\nEarlier societies of [[hunter-gatherer]] [[tribe]]s had no social stratification, and later societies of the [[Bronze Age]] had noticeable social stratification, which saw the creation of [[Division of labour|occupational specialization]], the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[Class stratification|social classes]] of individuals who were of the elite [[Ruling class|ruling]] or [[Clergy|religious]] classes, full-time [[warrior]]s and wealthy [[Barter|merchants]], contrasted with those individuals on the other end of the [[Social class|economic spectrum]] who were [[Poverty|poor]], [[History of slavery|enslaved]] and [[Hunger|hungry]]. In between these two economic models (the hunter-gatherer tribes and Bronze Age civilisations) we find the later Neolithic and [[Copper Age|Eneolithic]] societies such as the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture, where the first indications of social stratification began to be found. However, it would be a mistake to overemphasise the impact of social stratification in the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture, since it was still (even in its later phases) very much an [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] society. And of course, social stratification was just one of the many aspects of what is regarded as a fully established [[Civilization|civilised society]], which began to appear in the Bronze Age.<ref name=\"Khol\" />\n\nLike other Neolithic societies, the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture had almost no [[division of labor]]. Although this culture's settlements sometimes grew to become the largest on Earth at the time (up to 15,000 people in the largest),<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Chapman|first=John|last2=Videiko|first2=Mikhail Yu|last3=Hale|first3=Duncan|last4=Gaydarska|first4=Bisserka|last5=Burdo|first5=Natalia|last6=Rassmann|first6=Knut|last7=Mischka|first7=Carsten|last8=M\u00fcller|first8=Johannes|last9=Korvin-Piotrovskiy|first9=Aleksey|date=2014|title=The Second Phase of the Trypillia Mega-Site Methodological Revolution: A New Research Agenda|journal=European Journal of Archaeology|language=en|volume=17|issue=3|pages=369\u2013406|doi=10.1179/1461957114Y.0000000062|issn=1461-9571|doi-access=free}}</ref> there is no evidence that has been discovered of labour specialisation. Every household probably had members of the extended family who would work in the fields to raise crops, go to the woods to hunt game and bring back firewood, work by the river to bring back clay or fish and all of the other duties that would be needed to survive. Contrary to popular belief, the Neolithic people experienced considerable abundance of food and other resources.<ref name=\"Mantu\" />\n\nSince every household was almost entirely self-sufficient, there was very little need for trade. However, there were certain mineral resources that, because of limitations due to distance and prevalence, did form the rudimentary foundation for a trade network that towards the end of the culture began to develop into a more complex system, as is attested to by an increasing number of artifacts from other cultures that have been dated to the latter period.<ref name=\"Mallory\" />\n\nToward the end of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture's existence (from roughly 3000 BC to 2750 BC), [[copper]] traded from other societies (notably, from the [[Balkans]]) began to appear throughout the region, and members of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture began to acquire skills necessary to use it to create various items. Along with the raw copper ore, finished copper tools, hunting weapons and other artefacts were also brought in from other cultures.<ref name=\"Mantu\" /> This marked the transition from the Neolithic to the Eneolithic, also known as the Chalcolithic or Copper Age. Bronze artifacts began to show up in archaeological sites toward the very end of the culture. The primitive trade network of this society, that had been slowly growing more complex, was supplanted by the more complex trade network of the Proto-Indo-European culture that eventually replaced the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture.<ref name=\"Mantu\" />\n<gallery widths=\"160\" heights=\"160\">\nFile:CucuteniBattleAxes.JPG|Copper tools\nFile:MuzeuldeistorienaturalavienaCucutenitripolieartefacts.JPG|Around 4000 BC this treasure was buried on a Dniester river terrace\nFile:CucuteniNeoliticBirdSpoon.JPG|Cucuteni Spoon\nFile:CucutenibirdGoddess.JPG|Clay bird figurines\nFile:Cucuteni IMG 3697.JPG\nFile:Cucutenireprezentarezoomorfica.JPG\nFile:Trypillian house.jpg\nFile:Trypillian house2.jpg\nFile:Cucuteni IMG 3666.JPG\nFile:VasantropomorficCucuteni.JPG\nFile:CucuteniOmegaPottery.JPG\nFile:CucuteniPottery6.jpg\nFile:Cucutetenipottery.JPG\nFile:CycyteniOmegaPottery34.JPG\nFile:Expozitie cucuteni muzeul BucurestiDPP 0007.JPG\nFile:Expozi\u021bia Cultura Cucuteni, valori reg\u0103site ale preistoriei moderne.jpg\nFile:\u5e93\u5e93\u7279\u5c3c\u9676\u7f50.JPG\nFile:02013 Der \"bemalten Keramik\" vom Trypillja-Typus am Anfang des 30.Jhs.v.

Cultivating the soil (using an [[ard (plough)|ard]] or scratch plough), harvesting crops and tending livestock was probably the main occupation for most people. Typically for a Neolithic culture, the vast{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} majority of their diet consisted of [[cereal]] grains. They cultivated [[Common wheat|club wheat]], [[oats]], [[rye]], [[proso millet]], [[barley]] and [[hemp]], which were probably ground and baked as [[Flatbread|unleavened bread]] in clay ovens or on heated stones in the home. They also grew peas and beans, [[apricot]], [[cherry plum]] and [[Vitis vinifera|wine grapes]] \u2013 though there is no solid evidence that they actually made [[wine]].<ref name=\"Com\u0219a\">{{cite journal | last = Com\u0219a | first = Eugen | title = Cultura plantelor \u00een cursul epocii neolitice pe teritoriul Rom\u00e2niei |trans-title=Cultivated plants of the Neolithic current epoch in Romanian territory | journal = Terra Nostra: Culegere de Materiale Privind Istoria Agriculturii \u00een Rom\u00e2nia (Our Earth: Selections from a Material Perspective of Agricultural History in Romania) | volume = 3 | pages = 243\u2013252 | publisher = Consiliul Superior al Agriculturii | location = Bucharest | year = 1973 | oclc = 72954112}}</ref> There is also evidence that they may have kept bees.<ref>{{Citation | last = Crane | first = Eva | title = The world history of beekeeping and honey hunting |  place = New York | publisher = Routledge | year = 1999 | pages = 40\u201341 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=ANTSvKj1AZEC | oclc = 41049690 | isbn = 0-415-92467-7}}</ref>\n\nThe [[zooarchaeology]] of Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia sites indicate that the inhabitants practiced animal husbandry. Their domesticated livestock consisted primarily of cattle, but included smaller numbers of pigs, sheep and goats.

However, whether these finds are of domesticated or wild horses is debated. Before they were domesticated, humans hunted wild horses for meat. On the other hand, one hypothesis of [[horse domestication]] places it in the steppe region adjacent to the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture at roughly the same time (4000\u20133500 BC), so it is possible the culture was familiar with the domestic horse.

First, the brackish water from the spring was boiled in large pottery vessels, producing a dense [[brine]]. The brine was then heated in a ceramic briquetage vessel until all moisture was evaporated, with the remaining crystallised salt adhering to the inside walls of the vessel. Then the briquetage vessel was broken open, and the salt was scraped from the shards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cimec.ro/arheologie/sarea/index.html|title=Sarea, Timpul \u015fi Omul|first=Vasile|last=Andrei|website=www.cimec.ro|accessdate=6 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221030521/http://www.cimec.ro/arheologie/sarea/index.html|archivedate=21 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe provision of salt was a major logistical problem for the largest Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia settlements. As they came to rely upon cereal foods over salty meat and fish, Neolithic cultures had to incorporate supplementary sources of salt into their diet. Similarly, domestic cattle need to be provided with extra sources of salt beyond their normal diet or their milk production is reduced.

Long coils of clay were placed in circles to form first the base and then the walls of the vessel. Once the desired shape and height of the finished product was built up the sides would then be smoothed to create a seamless surface. This technique was the earliest form of pottery shaping and the most common in the Neolithic; however, there is some evidence that they also used a primitive type of slow-turning [[potter's wheel]], an innovation that did not become common in Europe until the [[Iron Age]].<ref name=\"Cuco\u02191\" />\n\nCharacteristically vessels were elaborately decorated with swirling patterns and intricate designs. Sometimes decorative incisions were added prior to firing, and sometimes these were filled with coloured dye to produce a dimensional effect. In the early period, the colours used to decorate pottery were limited to a rusty-red and white. Later, potters added additional colours to their products and experimented with more advanced ceramic techniques.<ref name=\"Monah\"/> The pigments used to decorate ceramics were based on [[iron oxide]] for red hues, [[calcium carbonate]], [[Magnetite|iron magnetite]] and [[Jacobsite|manganese Jacobsite]] ores for black and [[calcium silicate]] for white. The black pigment, which was introduced during the later period of the culture, was a rare commodity: taken from a few sources and circulated (to a limited degree) throughout the region.

It was used as a support or stand, and upon its discovery was hailed as a symbolic masterpiece of Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture. It is believed that the four stylised feminine silhouettes facing inward in an interlinked circle represented a ''[[Hora (dance)|hora]]'', or ritualistic dance. Similar artefacts were later found in [[Bere\u015fti]] and [[Dr\u0103gu\u015feni, Ia\u015fi|Dr\u0103gu\u0219eni]].\n\nExtant figurines excavated at the Cucuteni sites are thought to represent religious artefacts, but their meaning or use is still unknown.

Artefacts have been found inside these sanctuaries, some of them having been intentionally buried in the ground within the structure, that are clearly of a religious nature, and have provided insights into some of the beliefs, and perhaps some of the rituals and structure, of the members of this society. Additionally, artefacts of an apparent religious nature have also been found within many domestic Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia homes.\n\nMany of these artefacts are clay figurines or statues.

This first writing system did not suddenly appear out of nowhere,{{original research inline|date=July 2016}} but gradually developed from less stylised pictographic systems that used [[ideogram|ideographic]] and [[mnemonic]] symbols that contained meaning, but did not have the linguistic flexibility of the [[natural language]] writing system that the Sumerians first conceived.

The first discovery of this script occurred at the archaeological site in the village of [[Turda\u015f]] (Romania), and consisted of a collection of artefacts that had what appeared to be an unknown system of writing. In 1908, more of these same kinds of artefacts were discovered at a site near [[Vin\u010da]], outside the city of [[Belgrade]], [[Serbia]]. Scholars subsequently labelled this the \"Vin\u010da script\" or \"Vin\u010da\u2013Turda\u015f script\". There is a considerable amount of controversy surrounding the Vin\u010da script as to how old it is, as well as whether it should be considered as an actual writing system, an example of proto-writing, or just a collection of meaningful symbols. Indeed, the entire subject regarding every aspect of the Vin\u010da script is fraught with controversy.<ref name=\"Merlini\" />\n\nBeginning in 1875 up to the present, archaeologists have found more than a thousand Neolithic era clay artefacts that have examples of symbols similar to the Vin\u010da script scattered widely throughout south-eastern Europe. This includes the discoveries of what appear to be [[Barter tokens of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture|barter tokens]], which were used as an early form of currency. Thus it appears that the Vin\u010da or Vin\u010da\u2013Turda\u015f script is not restricted to just the region around Belgrade, which is where the Vin\u010da culture existed, but that it was spread across most of southeastern Europe, and was used throughout the geographical region of the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture. As a result of this widespread use of this set of symbolic representations, historian Marco Merlini has suggested that it be given a name other than the Vin\u010da script, since this implies that it was only used among the Vin\u010da culture around the Pannonian Plain, at the very western edge of the extensive area where examples of this symbolic system have been discovered. Merlini has proposed naming this system the [[Vin\u010da symbols|Danube Script]], which some scholars have begun to accept.<ref name=\"Merlini2\">{{cite journal | last= Merlini | first= Marco | first2= Gheorghe | last2= Lazarovici | editor1-first= Sabin Adrian | editor1-last= Luca | year= 2008 | title= Settling discovery circumstances, dating and utilization of the T\u0103rt\u0103ria Tablets | journal= Acta Terrae Septemcastrensis | volume= 8 | series= Proceedings of the International Colloquium: The Carpathian Basin and its Role in the Neolithisation of the Balkan Peninsula | pages= 111\u2013195 | publisher= Bucure\u015fti Editura Economica | location= Bucharest, Romania | issn= 1583-1817 | oclc= 445461856 | url= http://arheologie.ulbsibiu.ro/publicatii/ats/ats8/merlini.pdf | accessdate= 17 January 2010 | url-status= live | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110722210229/http://arheologie.ulbsibiu.ro/publicatii/ats/ats8/merlini.pdf | archivedate= 22 July 2011 }}</ref> However, even this name change would not be extensive enough, since it does not cover the region in Ukraine, as well as the Balkans, where examples of these symbols are also found.

It revealed that seven of the individuals whose remains where analysed belonged to: two to [[Haplogroup HV (mtDNA)|haplogroup HV(xH)]], two to [[Haplogroup H (mtDNA)|haplogroup H]], one to [[Haplogroup R0 (mtDNA)|haplogroup R0(xHV)]], one to [[Haplogroup J (mtDNA)|haplogroup J]] and one to [[Haplogroup T4 (mtDNA)|haplogroup T4]], the latter also being the oldest sample of the set.\n\nThe authors conclude that the population living around Verteba Cave was fairly heterogenous, but that the wide chronological age of the specimens might indicate that the heterogeneity might have been due to natural population flow during this timeframe. The authors also link the R0(xHV) and HV(xH) haplogroups with European [[Paleolithic]] populations, and consider the T4 and J haplogroups as hallmarks of Neolithic demic intrusions from the southeast (the north-pontic region) rather than from the west (i.e. the [[Linear Pottery culture]]).<ref name=\"Nikitin\">{{cite journal\n |last1       = Nikitin\n |first1      = Alexey G.\n |first2      = Mykhailo P.\n |last2       = Sokhatsky\n |first3      = Mykola M.\n |last3       = Kovaliukh\n |first4      = Mykhailo Y.\n |last4       = Videiko\n |title       = Comprehensive Site Chronology and Ancient Mitochondrial DNA Analysis from Verteba Cave \u2013 a Trypillian Culture Site of Eneolithic Ukraine\n |journal     = Interdisciplinaria Archaeologica \u2013 Natural Sciences in Archaeology\n |issue       = 1\u20132\n |pages       = 9\u201318\n |publisher   = Archaeological Centre Olomouc, Government Funded Organisation\n |date        = 14 April 2011\n |url         = http://iansa.eu/papers/IANSA-2010-01-02-nikitin.pdf\n |accessdate  = 14 May 2013\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120424145229/http://www.iansa.eu/papers/IANSA-2010-01-02-nikitin.pdf\n |archivedate = 24 April 2012\n|doi = 10.24916/iansa.2011.1.1\n }}</ref>\n\nA 2017 [[ancient DNA]] study found evidence of genetic contact between the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture and steppe populations from the east from as early as 3600 BCE, well before the influx of [[steppe ancestry]] into Europe associated with the Yamnaya culture.<ref>{{cite biorxiv|last=Mathieson|first=Iain|last2=Roodenberg|first2=Song\u00fcl Alpaslan|last3=Posth|first3=Cosimo|last4=Sz\u00e9cs\u00e9nyi-Nagy|first4=Anna|last5=Rohland|first5=Nadin|last6=Mallick|first6=Swapan|last7=Olalde|first7=I\u00f1igo|last8=Broomandkhoshbacht|first8=Nasreen|last9=Cheronet|first9=Olivia|display-authors=1|date=2017-05-30|title=The Genomic History Of Southeastern Europe|biorxiv=10.1101/135616}}</ref>\n\nA February 2018 study published in [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] included an analysis of three males from the Cucuteni\u2013Trypillia culture.

Sawyer swam against the tide of history when he unsuccessfully fought to prevent corporate ownership over Nevada casinos.\n\nSawyer was the first western governor to endorse the fledgling presidential campaign of Massachusetts Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1960.\n\nCommentators have reflected on Sawyer's career as follows: Grant Sawyer served two turbulent terms as Nevada's governor from 1959 to 1967. Sawyer was an advocate of progressive change. By the late fifties he had come so far from his start in the conservative political machine of Senator [[Patrick McCarran]] that many powerful Nevadans considered his policies on education, the environment, and civil rights to be dangerously radical. When he demanded meaningful regulatory control over casino gaming and took decisive action to purge the industry of its mob connections, the establishment's resistance stiffened. Eventually, Sawyer's positions brought him into open conflict with special interests and led to a collision with the justice department of the federal government, but he never backed down.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1967, Sawyer co-founded Lionel Sawyer & Collins.  For many years, this was the largest private law firm in Nevada.  The firm ceased operations on December 31, 2014,<ref>http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/jane-ann-morrison/closing-las-vegas-law-firm-marks-end-era</ref> with nineteen of its lawyers joining [[Fennemore Craig]].\n\nSawyer died on February 19, 1996, in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] of [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] of a debilitating [[stroke]] suffered in 1993, at the age of 77.<ref name=GSObit>{{cite web|title=Former governor Grant Sawyer, 77, dies|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1996/feb/20/former-governor-grant-sawyer-77-dies/|work=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> His wife Bette, a native of [[Baker City, Oregon|Baker City]], [[Oregon]], died on September 11, 2002, at the age of 79.

He was defeated in his attempt at a third term by [[Paul Laxalt]].\n\nGovernor Sawyer worked to push through civil rights policies and legislation, a difficult process in a state that had been accused of being \"the [[Mississippi]] of the West.\"<ref name=rocha>{{cite web|last=Rocha|first=Guy|title=Myth #105 - The Mississippi of the West|url=http://nsla.nevadaculture.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=786:myth-105&catid=130:archives-myth|work=Nevada State Library and Archives|accessdate=16 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722132510/http://nsla.nevadaculture.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=786:myth-105&catid=130:archives-myth|archive-date=22 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nHe was responsible for the development of the modern casino regulatory system with the passage of the Gaming Control Act of 1959 and the formation of the  [[Nevada Gaming Commission]]. Sawyer swam against the tide of history when he unsuccessfully fought to prevent corporate ownership over Nevada casinos.\n\nSawyer was the first western governor to endorse the fledgling presidential campaign of Massachusetts Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1960.\n\nCommentators have reflected on Sawyer's career as follows: Grant Sawyer served two turbulent terms as Nevada's governor from 1959 to 1967. Sawyer was an advocate of progressive change. By the late fifties he had come so far from his start in the conservative political machine of Senator [[Patrick McCarran]] that many powerful Nevadans considered his policies on education, the environment, and civil rights to be dangerously radical. When he demanded meaningful regulatory control over casino gaming and took decisive action to purge the industry of its mob connections, the establishment's resistance stiffened. Eventually, Sawyer's positions brought him into open conflict with special interests and led to a collision with the justice department of the federal government, but he never backed down.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1967, Sawyer co-founded Lionel Sawyer & Collins.  For many years, this was the largest private law firm in Nevada.  The firm ceased operations on December 31, 2014,<ref>http://www.reviewjournal.com/columns-blogs/jane-ann-morrison/closing-las-vegas-law-firm-marks-end-era</ref> with nineteen of its lawyers joining [[Fennemore Craig]].\n\nSawyer died on February 19, 1996, in [[Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] of [[Complication (medicine)|complications]] of a debilitating [[stroke]] suffered in 1993, at the age of 77.<ref name=GSObit>{{cite web|title=Former governor Grant Sawyer, 77, dies|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/1996/feb/20/former-governor-grant-sawyer-77-dies/|work=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=18 June 2011}}</ref> His wife Bette, a native of [[Baker City, Oregon|Baker City]], [[Oregon]], died on September 11, 2002, at the age of 79.

Crawford then signed a motion picture contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1925; her career spanned six decades, multiple studios, and controversies.\n\nAt different stages of her career, she was noted for her diverse roles playing sympathetic and unsympathetic characters, and for realistic yet multi-layered performances. Her films ranged in genres from contemporary crime, melodramas, film noir, several historical costume dramas, romances, mysteries, musicals, suspense, horror, to three westerns and over a dozen comedies. Regardless, her greater successes and perhaps most memorable performances were in romantic dramas and melodramas. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Crawford tenth on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema]].\n\nIn the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled and later surpassed that of MGM colleagues [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Greta Garbo]]. Though she started portraying flappers, Crawford often played wealthy women in distress (''[[Dance, Fools, Dance]]'', ''[[This Modern Age]]'', ''[[Letty Lynton]]'',  ''[[No More Ladies]]'', ''[[I Live My Life]]'', ''[[Susan and God]]'') or hard-working young women who found romance and success (''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'', ''[[Paid (1930 film)|Paid]]'', ''[[Laughing Sinners]]'' , ''[[Dancing Lady]]'', ''[[Sadie McKee]]'', ''[[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1937 film)|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney]]'', ''[[The Shining Hour]]'', ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'', ''[[Mannequin]]''). These characters and stories were well received by [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era audiences, and were popular with women. Crawford became one of Hollywood's more prominent movie stars, and one of the higher-paid women in the United States.\n\nIn 1945, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her work in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'', and received Best Actress nominations for ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947) and ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952). Crawford continued to act in film and television throughout the 1950s and 1960s; she returned to box office success and critical acclaim with [[horror film]] ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962), in which she starred alongside her long-time rival [[Bette Davis]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/fx-feud-joan-crawford-bette-davis-oscars|title=Fact-Checking Feud: Joan Crawford and Bette Davis's 1963 Oscar Showdown|last=Miller|first=Julie|work=HWD|access-date=September 22, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, Crawford became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company through her marriage to company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer [[Alfred Steele]].\n\nIn 1970 Crawford made her last theatrical film, and until a few weeks before her death, she continued to tape numerous regular radio spots and announcements for a variety of not-for-profit causes.

Crawford's relationships with her two elder children, [[Christina Crawford|Christina]] and Christopher, were acrimonious.

The two were allegedly married in 1924, and lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford.<ref name=considine12>Considine, p. 12</ref>\n\nCrawford wanted additional work, and approached [[Loews Theaters]] publicist [[Nils Granlund]].

She also appeared in ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' and ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' (both 1925), starring comedian [[ZaSu Pitts]]. This was soon followed by equally small and [[Billing (filmmaking)|unbilled]] roles in two other 1925 silent films: ''[[The Only Thing]]'', and ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald Spoto|title=Possessed: The Life of Joan Crawford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouUt6jGDAhgC|date=February 3, 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-8811-2|page=22}}</ref>\n\nMGM publicity head [[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith]] recognized her ability to become a major star, but felt her name sounded fake; he told studio head [[Louis B.

The initial choice was \"Joan Arden\", but after another actress was found to have prior claim to that name, the alternate surname \"Crawford\" became the choice. She later said that she wanted her first name to be pronounced Jo-Anne, and that she hated the name Crawford because it sounded like \"crawfish\", but also admitted she \"liked the security\" that went with the name.<ref>Crawford, quoted in Newquist, p. 31</ref>\n\n===Self-promotion, and early successes===\nGrowing increasingly frustrated over the size and quality of the parts she was given, Crawford embarked on a campaign of self-promotion. As MGM screenwriter [[Frederica Sagor Maas]] recalled, \"No one decided to make Joan Crawford a star. Joan Crawford became a star because Joan Crawford decided to become a star.\"<ref>Maas, quoted in LaSalle, p. 123</ref> She began attending dances in the afternoons and evenings at hotels around Hollywood and at dance venues on the beach piers, where she often won dance competitions with her performances of the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] and the [[Black Bottom (dance)|Black Bottom]].<ref>Thompson, p. 47</ref>\n[[File:Crawford-Gilbert-1928.JPG|thumb|upright|With John Gilbert in the film ''[[Four Walls (film)|Four Walls]]'' (1928)]]\nHer strategy worked and MGM cast her in the film where she first made an impression on audiences, [[Edmund Goulding]]'s ''[[Sally, Irene and Mary]]'' (1925). From the beginning of her career, Crawford considered Norma Shearer \u2013 the studio's most-popular actress \u2013 her professional nemesis. Shearer was married to MGM Head of Production [[Irving Thalberg]]; hence, she had the first choice of scripts, and had more control than other stars in what films she would and would not make.

The transition from silent to sound caused panic for many, if not all, involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents, or simply because of their refusal to make the transition to talkies.\n\nMany studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last of the major studios to switch over to sound. ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'' was one of the studio's first all-talking films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars' ability to make the transition from silent to sound. Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song \"Got a Feeling for You\" during the film's first act.\n\nCrawford made a successful transition to talkies with her first starring role in the all-talking feature-length film in ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), co-starring [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]].

Her next film was ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), co-starring [[John Garfield]], a romantic drama about a love affair between an older woman and a younger man. She starred alongside [[Van Heflin]] in ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947), for which she received a second Academy Award nomination.

Although the film was highly publicized as Crawford's major comeback, it was a critical and financial failure, known today for its [[Camp (style)|camp]] appeal. In 1954, she starred in ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', a [[Cult Classics|cult classic]] directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], co-starring [[Sterling Hayden]] and [[Mercedes McCambridge]].

Although she was not the star of the film, she received positive reviews. Crawford later named the role as being one of her personal favorites.

(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962). Despite the actresses' earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested [[Bette Davis]] for the role of Jane. The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them. The director, [[Robert Aldrich]], fueling publicity rumors, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers, and commented, \"It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly.\"<ref>Considine, ibid.</ref>\n\nAfter filming was completed, their public comments against each other propelled their animosity into a life-long feud. The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within eleven days of its nationwide release reviving Davis and Crawford's careers. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford contacted each of the other Oscar nominees in the category ([[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Geraldine Page]], and [[Anne Bancroft]], all East Coast-based actresses), to let them know that if they could not attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed. Both Davis and Crawford were backstage - Crawford having presented best director - when the absent [[Anne Bancroft]] was announced as the winner and Crawford accepted the award on her behalf. Davis claimed for the rest of her life that Crawford had campaigned against her, a charge Crawford denied.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThat same year, Crawford starred as Lucy Harbin in [[William Castle]]'s horror mystery ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' (1964). [[Robert Aldrich]] cast Crawford and Davis in ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964). After a purported campaign of harassment by Davis on location in Louisiana, Crawford returned to Hollywood entering a hospital. After a prolonged absence, during which Crawford was accused of feigning illness, Aldrich was forced to replace her with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. Crawford, who was devastated, said \"I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed ...

Crawford then signed a motion picture contract with [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] in 1925; her career spanned six decades, multiple studios, and controversies.\n\nAt different stages of her career, she was noted for her diverse roles playing sympathetic and unsympathetic characters, and for realistic yet multi-layered performances. Her films ranged in genres from contemporary crime, melodramas, film noir, several historical costume dramas, romances, mysteries, musicals, suspense, horror, to three westerns and over a dozen comedies. Regardless, her greater successes and perhaps most memorable performances were in romantic dramas and melodramas. In 1999, the [[American Film Institute]] ranked Crawford tenth on its list of the [[AFI's 100 Years...100 Stars|greatest female stars of Classic Hollywood Cinema]].\n\nIn the 1930s, Crawford's fame rivaled and later surpassed that of MGM colleagues [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Greta Garbo]]. Though she started portraying flappers, Crawford often played wealthy women in distress (''[[Dance, Fools, Dance]]'', ''[[This Modern Age]]'', ''[[Letty Lynton]]'',  ''[[No More Ladies]]'', ''[[I Live My Life]]'', ''[[Susan and God]]'') or hard-working young women who found romance and success (''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'', ''[[Paid (1930 film)|Paid]]'', ''[[Laughing Sinners]]'' , ''[[Dancing Lady]]'', ''[[Sadie McKee]]'', ''[[The Last of Mrs. Cheyney (1937 film)|The Last of Mrs. Cheyney]]'', ''[[The Shining Hour]]'', ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'', ''[[Mannequin]]''). These characters and stories were well received by [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era audiences, and were popular with women. Crawford became one of Hollywood's more prominent movie stars, and one of the higher-paid women in the United States.\n\nIn 1945, she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her work in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'', and received Best Actress nominations for ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947) and ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952). Crawford continued to act in film and television throughout the 1950s and 1960s; she returned to box office success and critical acclaim with [[horror film]] ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962), in which she starred alongside her long-time rival [[Bette Davis]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/04/fx-feud-joan-crawford-bette-davis-oscars|title=Fact-Checking Feud: Joan Crawford and Bette Davis's 1963 Oscar Showdown|last=Miller|first=Julie|work=HWD|access-date=September 22, 2017|language=en}}</ref>\n\nIn 1955, Crawford became involved with the Pepsi-Cola Company through her marriage to company Chairman and Chief Executive Officer [[Alfred Steele]].\n\nIn 1970 Crawford made her last theatrical film, and until a few weeks before her death, she continued to tape numerous regular radio spots and announcements for a variety of not-for-profit causes.

Crawford's relationships with her two elder children, [[Christina Crawford|Christina]] and Christopher, were acrimonious.

Shubert]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Shubert put her in the chorus line for his 1924 show, ''Innocent Eyes'', at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]] on Broadway in New York City. While appearing in ''Innocent Eyes'', Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton. The two were allegedly married in 1924, and lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford.<ref name=considine12>Considine, p. 12</ref>\n\nCrawford wanted additional work, and approached [[Loews Theaters]] publicist [[Nils Granlund]]. Granlund secured a position for her with singer [[Harry Richman]]'s act and arranged for her to do a screen test which he sent to producer [[Harry Rapf]] in Hollywood.<ref name=\"Granlund\">Granlund, p. 147</ref> Rapf notified Granlund on December 24, 1924, that [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM) had offered Crawford a contract at $75 a week. Granlund immediately wired LeSueur, who had returned to her mother's home in Kansas City, with the news; she borrowed $400 for travel expenses.<ref name=\"movie contract\">Granlund, p. 135</ref>\n\nCredited as Lucille LeSueur, her first film was ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' in 1925, as the body double for [[Norma Shearer]], MGM's most popular female star. She also appeared in ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' and ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' (both 1925), starring comedian [[ZaSu Pitts]]. This was soon followed by equally small and [[Billing (filmmaking)|unbilled]] roles in two other 1925 silent films: ''[[The Only Thing]]'', and ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Donald Spoto|title=Possessed: The Life of Joan Crawford|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ouUt6jGDAhgC|date=February 3, 2011|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-1-4070-8811-2|page=22}}</ref>\n\nMGM publicity head [[Pete Smith (film producer)|Pete Smith]] recognized her ability to become a major star, but felt her name sounded fake; he told studio head [[Louis B. Mayer]] that her last name, LeSueur, reminded him of a sewer. Smith organized a contest called \"Name the Star\" in ''Movie Weekly'' to allow readers to select her new stage name. The initial choice was \"Joan Arden\", but after another actress was found to have prior claim to that name, the alternate surname \"Crawford\" became the choice. She later said that she wanted her first name to be pronounced Jo-Anne, and that she hated the name Crawford because it sounded like \"crawfish\", but also admitted she \"liked the security\" that went with the name.<ref>Crawford, quoted in Newquist, p. 31</ref>\n\n===Self-promotion, and early successes===\nGrowing increasingly frustrated over the size and quality of the parts she was given, Crawford embarked on a campaign of self-promotion. As MGM screenwriter [[Frederica Sagor Maas]] recalled, \"No one decided to make Joan Crawford a star. Joan Crawford became a star because Joan Crawford decided to become a star.\"<ref>Maas, quoted in LaSalle, p. 123</ref> She began attending dances in the afternoons and evenings at hotels around Hollywood and at dance venues on the beach piers, where she often won dance competitions with her performances of the [[Charleston (dance)|Charleston]] and the [[Black Bottom (dance)|Black Bottom]].<ref>Thompson, p. 47</ref>\n[[File:Crawford-Gilbert-1928.JPG|thumb|upright|With John Gilbert in the film ''[[Four Walls (film)|Four Walls]]'' (1928)]]\nHer strategy worked and MGM cast her in the film where she first made an impression on audiences, [[Edmund Goulding]]'s ''[[Sally, Irene and Mary]]'' (1925). From the beginning of her career, Crawford considered Norma Shearer \u2013 the studio's most-popular actress \u2013 her professional nemesis. Shearer was married to MGM Head of Production [[Irving Thalberg]]; hence, she had the first choice of scripts, and had more control than other stars in what films she would and would not make. Crawford was quoted to have said: \"How can I compete with Norma? She sleeps with the boss!\"<ref name=\"Donnelley2003\">{{cite book|author=Paul Donnelley|title=Fade to Black: A Book of Movie Obituaries|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qAhtNiAl3YsC&pg=PA632|year=2003|publisher=Omnibus|isbn=978-0-7119-9512-3|page=632}}</ref>\n\nCrawford was named one of [[WAMPAS Baby Stars|1926's WAMPAS Baby Stars]], along with [[Mary Astor]], [[Dolores del R\u00edo]], [[Janet Gaynor]], and [[Fay Wray]], among others.

She stated that she learned more about acting from watching Chaney work than from anyone else in her career. \"It was then\", she said, \"I became aware for the first time of the difference between standing in front of a camera, and acting.\" Also in 1927, she appeared alongside her close friend, [[William Haines]], in ''[[Spring Fever (1927 film)|Spring Fever]]'', which was the first of three movies the duo made together.<ref>Crawford, quoted in LaSalle, p. 120</ref><ref>Crawford, quoted in Skal, p. 73</ref>\n\nIn 1928, Crawford starred opposite Ram\u00f3n Novarro in ''[[Across to Singapore]]'', but it was her role as Diana Medford in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) that catapulted her to stardom. The role established her as a symbol of modern 1920s-style femininity which rivaled [[Clara Bow]], the original \"It girl\", and Hollywood's foremost [[flapper]]. A stream of hits followed ''Our Dancing Daughters'', including two more flapper-themed movies, in which Crawford embodied for her legion of fans (many of whom were women) an idealized vision of the free-spirited, all-American girl.<ref name=\"BeanNegra2002\">{{cite book|author1=Jennifer M.

Following that first invitation, Crawford and Fairbanks, Jr., became more frequent guests. While the Fairbanks men played golf together, Crawford was either left with Pickford, who would retire to her quarters, or simply left alone.<ref>Thomas, p. 63</ref>\n\nTo rid herself of her Southwestern accent, Crawford tirelessly practiced diction and elocution. She said:<ref>Crawford, quoted in Thomas, p. 65</ref>{{quote|text=If I were to speak lines, it would be a good idea, I thought, to read aloud to myself, listen carefully to my voice quality and enunciation, and try to learn in that manner.

When I came to a word I did not know how to pronounce, I looked it up and repeated it correctly fifteen times.}}\n\n===Transition to sound, and continued success===\n[[File:Joan Crawford 1932.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|right|Crawford in 1932]]\nAfter the release of ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'' in 1927\u2014the first feature-length film with some audible dialogue\u2014[[sound film]]s became all the rage. The transition from silent to sound caused panic for many, if not all, involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents, or simply because of their refusal to make the transition to talkies.\n\nMany studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last of the major studios to switch over to sound. ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'' was one of the studio's first all-talking films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars' ability to make the transition from silent to sound. Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song \"Got a Feeling for You\" during the film's first act.\n\nCrawford made a successful transition to talkies with her first starring role in the all-talking feature-length film in ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929), co-starring [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]. Despite the success of the film at the box office, it received mixed reviews from critics, who noted that while Crawford seemed nervous at making the transition to sound, she had become one of the most popular actresses in the world.<ref name=\"Roar72\">{{citation|last1=H\u00e1y|first1=Peter|authorlink=Peter H\u00e1y (Canadian author, publisher and bookseller)|title=MGM: When the Lion Roars|year=1991|publisher=Turner Publishing, Inc.|location=Atlanta|isbn=1-878685-04-X|page=[https://archive.org/details/mgmwhenlionroars0000hayp/page/72 72]|url=https://archive.org/details/mgmwhenlionroars0000hayp/page/72}}</ref>'' [[Montana Moon]]'' (1930), an uneasy mix of Western clich\u00e9s and music, teamed her with [[John Mack Brown]] and [[Ricardo Cortez]].

Crawford said one of the main reasons she signed with Warner Bros. was because she wanted to play the character \"Mattie\" in a proposed 1944 film version of [[Edith Wharton]]'s novel ''[[Ethan Frome]]'' (1911).\n[[File:Joan Crawford in Mildred Pierce trailer.jpg|thumb|''Mildred Pierce'' trailer (1945)|alt=]]\nShe wanted to play the title role in ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945), but [[Bette Davis]] was the studio's first choice. However, Davis turned the role down. Director [[Michael Curtiz]] did not want Crawford to play the part, and he instead lobbied for the casting of [[Barbara Stanwyck]]. Warner Bros. defied Curtiz and cast Crawford in the film. Throughout the entire production of the movie, Curtiz criticized Crawford. \"She comes over here with her high-hat airs and her goddamn shoulder pads... Why should I waste my time directing a has-been?\"<ref>Curtiz, quoted in Thomas, p. 146</ref> Curtiz demanded Crawford prove her suitability by taking a screen test; she agreed. After the test, Curtiz agreed to Crawford's casting. Costume fittings started filming off roughly when Curtiz suspected Crawford of wearing shoulder pads and he proceeded to tear the top of her dress. She said \"Thankfully I was wearing a bra.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4G4uCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA73&lpg=PA73&dq=joan+crawford+curtiz+shoulder+pad#v=onepage&q=joan%20crawford%20curtiz%20shoulder%20pad&f=false|title=Creating the Illusion: A Fashionable History of Hollywood Costume Designers|last=Jorgensen|first=Jay|last2=Scoggins|first2=Donald L.|date=2015-10-06|publisher=Running Press|isbn=9780762458073|language=en}}</ref> ''Mildred Pierce'' was a resounding critical and commercial success.

For several years, she starred in what were called \"a series of first-rate [[melodrama]]s\". Her next film was ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), co-starring [[John Garfield]], a romantic drama about a love affair between an older woman and a younger man. She starred alongside [[Van Heflin]] in ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947), for which she received a second Academy Award nomination. In ''[[Daisy Kenyon]]'' (1947), she appeared opposite [[Dana Andrews]] and [[Henry Fonda]], and in ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), her character has an ultimately deadly feud with a corrupt southern sheriff played by [[Sydney Greenstreet]]. She made a cameo in ''[[It's a Great Feeling]]'' (1949), poking fun at her own screen image. In 1950, she starred in the film noir ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' and in the melodrama ''[[Harriet Craig]]''.\n\nIn 1947, Crawford adopted two more children, whom she named Cindy and Cathy.

After a 10-year absence from MGM, she returned to that studio to star in ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'' (1953), a musical drama centering on the life of a demanding stage star who falls in love with a blind pianist, played by [[Michael Wilding (actor)|Michael Wilding]]. Although the film was highly publicized as Crawford's major comeback, it was a critical and financial failure, known today for its [[Camp (style)|camp]] appeal. In 1954, she starred in ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'', a [[Cult Classics|cult classic]] directed by [[Nicholas Ray]], co-starring [[Sterling Hayden]] and [[Mercedes McCambridge]]. She also starred in ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) with [[Jeff Chandler (actor)|Jeff Chandler]], and in ''[[Queen Bee (film)|Queen Bee]]'' (1955), alongside [[John Ireland (actor)|John Ireland]]. The following year, she starred opposite a young [[Cliff Robertson]] in ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956), and filmed a leading role in ''[[The Story of Esther Costello]]'' (1957), co-starring [[Rossano Brazzi]].

Although she was not the star of the film, she received positive reviews. Crawford later named the role as being one of her personal favorites.

(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962). Despite the actresses' earlier tensions, Crawford reportedly suggested [[Bette Davis]] for the role of Jane. The two stars maintained publicly that there was no feud between them. The director, [[Robert Aldrich]], fueling publicity rumors, explained that Davis and Crawford were each aware of how important the film was to their respective careers, and commented, \"It's proper to say that they really detested each other, but they behaved absolutely perfectly.\"<ref>Considine, ibid.</ref>\n\nAfter filming was completed, their public comments against each other propelled their animosity into a life-long feud. The film was a huge success, recouping its costs within eleven days of its nationwide release reviving Davis and Crawford's careers. Davis was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Jane Hudson. Crawford contacted each of the other Oscar nominees in the category ([[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Lee Remick]], [[Geraldine Page]], and [[Anne Bancroft]], all East Coast-based actresses), to let them know that if they could not attend the ceremony, she would be happy to accept the Oscar on their behalf; all agreed. Both Davis and Crawford were backstage - Crawford having presented best director - when the absent [[Anne Bancroft]] was announced as the winner and Crawford accepted the award on her behalf. Davis claimed for the rest of her life that Crawford had campaigned against her, a charge Crawford denied.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nThat same year, Crawford starred as Lucy Harbin in [[William Castle]]'s horror mystery ''[[Strait-Jacket]]'' (1964). [[Robert Aldrich]] cast Crawford and Davis in ''[[Hush...Hush, Sweet Charlotte]]'' (1964). After a purported campaign of harassment by Davis on location in Louisiana, Crawford returned to Hollywood entering a hospital. After a prolonged absence, during which Crawford was accused of feigning illness, Aldrich was forced to replace her with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. Crawford, who was devastated, said \"I heard the news of my replacement over the radio, lying in my hospital bed ... I cried for nine hours.\"<ref>Thomas, p. 225</ref> Crawford nursed grudges against Davis and Aldrich for the rest of her life, saying of Aldrich, \"He is a man who loves evil, horrendous, vile things\", to which Aldrich replied \"If the shoe fits, wear it, and I am very fond of Miss Crawford\".<ref>Considine, p. 363</ref> Despite being replaced, brief footage of Crawford made it into the film when she is seen sitting in a taxi in a wide shot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4K_40HXjkKw|title=The References: \"Feud\" Episode 7 + \"Hush...
